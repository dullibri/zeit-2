HEADLINE: Answering Questions on Student Loan Rates and the Murky Future

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
Figuring out how to pay for college has quickly turned into one of life's most complicated financial decisions.
This is not because the decision involves the largest number of dollars, although it is getting there for many families. Instead, it is because of a number of confounding factors. There is the uncertainty about a student's future ability to pay back student loan debt or whether spending twice as much for some schools will lead to a future that is twice as lucrative or happy. Then there is the difficulty of having a teenager participating in an enormous financial decision without much experience to draw on.
But perhaps the biggest problem is that people don't always know where to find good information about the choices and their consequences. This was readily apparent this week when, in the wake of our continuing series of stories about student loans, we took questions on the topic on our Bucks blog.
We were able to answer many of the questions fairly quickly, but others were big enough and searching enough that I decided to tackle them here. They fall into two categories: questions about why the rules on interest rates and refinancing are the way they are and how to avoid unpleasant financial surprises after you have taken on all that debt. 
Here are answers to four of the most important ones:
High Rates
While one type of federal student loan is (possibly temporarily) available at a 3.4 percent interest rate, others cost 6.8 percent, and loans for parents and graduate students are 7.9 percent. (Private loans from banks are often more costly.) Why are they so high, given the low prevailing rates elsewhere? ''I tell Europeans this, and they laugh and shake their heads,'' said one reader in Copenhagen. As we learned this year when a skirmish broke out in Washington over whether certain rates were going to rise, it is Congress that sets the rates. And doing so is a political act, not one necessarily rooted in economic science or reason.
''Budgeting for the government starts from the status quo, and the status quo is 6.8 percent and 7.9 percent,'' said Robert Shireman, who worked on student loan issues at the Department of Education for the first few years of President Obama's term. So any change that benefits borrowers means an offsetting cut someplace else, perhaps in Pell Grants for the truly needy.
Jason Delisle, director of the federal education budget project at the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan public policy institute in Washington, begins his analysis by noting how different student loans are from loans like mortgages, which have fixed interest rates that are half of what some student loans offer today. There is no credit check for students, no down payment and no collateral or consideration of where you are studying or whether you are majoring in underwater basket weaving.
Also, the loans come with repayment options and loan forgiveness programs that mortgages do not have.
That's not to say that Mr. Delisle isn't sympathetic to the call for lower rates, given that the student loan program does take in more than it lends out. But how would you set the new rates? The fixed interest rates that exist today seemed to be a good deal when Congress set them years ago.
''Congress could go back to variable interest rates,'' he said. ''But then people want a cap on those rates. What should the cap be? Somebody picks a number, and somebody always loses, either taxpayers or borrowers. And variable looks fair, because everyone has the same rate at the same time. But the problem with that is people can't really plan.''
Rafael Pardo, a bankruptcy professor at Emory University's law school, frames the issue differently. He would have no problem with the government making money on the student loan program if it were a bit easier to discharge the loans in bankruptcy for people who get in over their heads. But the process is hard enough that he recently spent nearly 650 hours of pro bono time trying to help just one debtor.
Alternatively, he would be fine with much lower rates while continuing to make it very hard to discharge the debt. ''But you can't be hitting them on the front end and on the back end,'' he said, which is his view of what the status quo does today.
Refinancing
A reader from New York City consolidated a bunch of loans into a single loan more than a decade ago at 8.125 percent and cannot refinance the loan at a lower rate because of rules that prohibit this. The comment summed things up this way: ''I have excellent credit but feel like I am unfairly punished and stuck with this extortionate interest rate for the rest of my working life.''
This, too, is something only Congress can change, and perhaps it didn't anticipate this problem or worry about it back when it thought it was doing students a favor by letting them consolidate debt at a fixed rate and relieving them of having to keep track of a big pile of individual loans.
Still, Mr. Shireman, who was a champion for the income-based repayment program that now allows people with lower incomes to make more affordable payments and have any remaining debt waived after a certain number of years, doesn't see this particular complaint gaining much traction.
''There aren't the votes to make this kind of change,'' he said. ''And I think one response would be that if these are high-income New York Times subscribers, then their needs are not as great as Pell Grant recipients. And if they're low-income and struggling, they have income-based repayment and they can get a big benefit from that.''
There are a few exceptions to the no-refinancing rule, and I have linked to an explanation of them (and the best explanations of many of the loan programs, repayment plans and other exceptions) in the online version of the column.
Forgiveness and Taxes
Another reader posted a question about the income-based repayment plan, noting that she will probably have a large amount of debt forgiven at the end of her term and is worried about the tax bill she will face at that point, when she will be 70 years old.
The amount of any debt forgiveness is often taxable income as far as the federal government is concerned. One big exception, however, is for people enrolled in something called public service loan forgiveness. I have linked to information on how to qualify for that particular program.
If you're not working in a public service job and are enrolled in income-based repayment, you will have to pay taxes on the debt the government forgives. This hasn't happened to anyone yet since the program is still new, and bipartisan efforts are under way to grant waivers for people who find themselves in this situation. ''I think the odds are very high that it will be fixed long before anyone qualifies for debt forgiveness,'' said Lauren Asher, president of the nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success.
Failing that, if your assets (including retirement savings and home equity) are less than your total liabilities right before the remaining student loan balance is supposed to be dismissed, you could declare yourself insolvent and avoid some or all of the big tax bill that way. I.R.S. publication 4681 has the details.
Safe Amount of Loans
And finally, the most difficult reader question of all: ''Before starting college, or even choosing which one to attend, how do you suggest families decide on how much borrowing is acceptable?''
There are so many variables here, it's hard to know where to start. It can depend on the career the teenager seems headed for, the willingness of parents to shoulder some of the debt and the economy.
Mark Kantrowitz, who runs the encyclopedic Finaid.org Web site, has developed one rough guideline: Students should borrow no more, in total, than whatever they think their first-year salary will be once they are finished (though ideally a lot less). That should keep the payments affordable, assuming they don't change their mind about what they want to study, and manage to get a job in their chosen field.
A slightly more conservative approach may be to limit yourself to $31,000, the maximum amount that the government generally lets undergraduates borrow in federal loans. If you avoid any private student loans from more traditional lenders, every dime of your debt will be eligible for the federal income-based repayment program in case there is little or no income for a while after graduation or later on.
The downside here is that limits like these (and they are caps, not targets, as Mr. Kantrowitz is quick to note) are dream killers for many young people. It may mean no law school at all or community college for two years or the local branch of the state university instead of the flagship.
So how do we get to a point where any college is in reach for every student? It's a question that no one has a realistic answer for yet.

HEADLINE: Analysts See Minor Boost for Housing in the Fed's Plan

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's ambitious effort to spur the recovery by aiding the housing market is likely to have a modest effect on home sales, given the pervasive weakness in the real estate market and the economy, analysts said Friday.
''The incremental benefit of slightly lower mortgage rates will be small,'' wrote Paul Diggle, a property economist at Capital Economics, an international research firm, in a note to clients. 
''After all, most borrowers in a position to refinance have probably already done so. And it's not obvious why a would-be buyer who wasn't tempted by a 3.7 percent mortgage rate would be by, let's say, a 3.25 percent rate,'' he wrote.
Others echoed that view, saying that the Fed program would support a recovery at the margins of the housing market, but that lower mortgage rates themselves would not be enough to spur a stronger turnaround.
On Thursday, the Federal Reserve announced a third major round of asset purchases intended to bring down interest rates and increase employment.
''While the economy appears to be at a path of moderate recovery, it isn't growing fast enough to make significant progress reducing the unemployment rate,'' Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said at a news conference on Thursday. ''The weak job market should concern every American.''
The Fed pledged to buy mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $40 billion a month for an indefinite period of time. The effort is expected to increase prices and demand for those securities and push down mortgage rates, already near record lows. That might encourage more families to refinance their mortgages and others to purchase a home, with ripple effects through the real estate industry and the rest of the economy.
Analysts said it might help strengthen and quicken a tentative housing recovery. In recent months, housing sales and, in some cases, sale prices have ticked up. Builders have broken ground on new projects.
More than six years since the real estate bubble started to deflate, many housing analysts said, if cautiously, that they believed the worst was over.
The announcement seems a signal that the Fed is confident that housing is turning around -- and that by itself could make home builders, mortgage financiers, real estate agents and buyers feel more confident as well, analysts said.
''There's definitely a sense at the Fed that this channel could be one of the more promising channels,'' said Joseph E. Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''Sometimes people are looking for a reason to be optimistic,'' he added.
On Thursday and Friday, financial markets cheered the Fed's announcement. Stocks climbed, as did the price of many of mortgage-backed securities.
But housing analysts cautioned that the Fed effort was no panacea. Millions of homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, leaving them in no position to sell. Millions more are unemployed or underemployed, and unable to afford a home. The foreclosure crisis is continuing and credit is tight, leaving many people who would like to buy a house unable to get a mortgage.
Jed Kolko, the chief economist at Trulia, a real estate analytics firm, anticipated a muted effect on sales.
''The big obstacles for people who want to buy are saving enough for a down payment and qualifying for a mortgage, because credit is still tight,'' Mr. Kolko said, saying that the Fed program would not directly address those problems.
Mr. Kolko and other analysts also noted that hundreds of thousands of Americans had already refinanced their mortgages to take advantage of rates near record lows. (Mr. Bernanke, for instance, refinanced his Washington home last year, taking out a 30-year mortgage with a 4.25 percent interest rate.) That leaves the pool of homeowners potentially looking to refinance smaller than it otherwise would be.
Still, some analysts said that the Fed's promise to push mortgage rates lower and to keep them there would encourage servicers to expand their capacity.
''I think it will have a meaningful impact on the housing market,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ''The refinancing boom is being tempered by the lack of capacity to refinance loans, because mortgage servicers are at full capacity.''
Analysts also said that any effort by the Fed to make borrowing cheaper and to aid the economy would help the housing recovery -- increasing construction employment, household wealth and many other facets of the economy in turn.
''This makes housing a little bit more affordable,'' said Gus Faucher, senior macroeconomist at PNC Financial Services Group. ''But more important, it is designed to give some confidence to households and financial markets that the recovery is going to continue.''
Mr. Zandi said: ''The main constraint on the recovery has been the housing market. Anything you can do to lift housing will have significant benefits for the economy.''

HEADLINE: Two Days In September

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Anniversary No. 1: Exactly four years ago, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection. In the days and weeks that followed, we saw the unfolding of the dramatic -- and ultimately successful -- effort by the federal government to rescue the banking system. But, once the dust settled, we began to see something else: like the stock market crash of 1929, Lehman wasn't an isolated event. Rather, it was a signal that deep problems had enveloped our economy -- problems that wouldn't be solved quickly or easily. That is why the Lehman bankruptcy still resonates. It was the moment everything changed.
Prior to Lehman, it was easy to believe that housing prices could only go up and that we could always rely on debt to maintain our standard of living. We shrugged as manufacturing jobs disappeared -- 5.8 million just since 2000 -- and good middle-class jobs became harder to find. We didn't talk much about income inequality. Nor did we care much that Wall Street had developed a mercenary trading culture, which had little to do with providing capital for companies, ostensibly its reason for being. 
Post-Lehman, economic reality set in. First came the Great Recession, followed by a recovery so weak that unemployment remains at around 8 percent. The huge debt overhang is a yoke holding back economic growth. Millions of homes have been foreclosed on. The Federal Reserve has continually opened its monetary spigots to boost the economy -- as it did again this week -- but the problems are simply too big to be fixed by monetary policy alone. That's the world we live in now.
Inevitably, this sense of never-ending economic struggle has led to a great deal of anger. On the right, that anger found its voice in the Tea Party. Its core belief is that government is the enemy, and that a more hardhearted approach -- slashing government spending and forcing people to fend for themselves -- is the best way to get back on track. However misguided, its conviction cannot be doubted.
On the left, that anger led, a year ago, to the rise of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Thus, Anniversary No. 2: Sept. 17, 2011, was the date Occupy Wall Street took over Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, which soon led to similar actions in cities across the country. The movement's primary issue was income inequality -- ''We are the 99 percent,'' they used to chant. Reporters swarmed into the park, interviewing Occupy protesters and speculating on whether Occupy had the potential to be a lasting force. ''Can Occupy Wall Street Become the Liberal Tea Party?'' asked The American Prospect magazine.
A year later, we know the answer: It can't, and it isn't. For all intents and purposes, the Occupy movement is dead, even as the Tea Party lives on. But why?
One reason, it seems to me, is that the Occupy protesters were purposely -- even proudly -- rudderless, eschewing leadership in favor of broad, and thus vague, consensus. It's hard to get anything done without leaders. A second is that while they had plenty of grievances, aimed mainly at the ''oppressive'' power of corporations, the Occupy protesters never got beyond their own slogans.
But the main reason is that, ultimately, Occupy Wall Street simply would not engage with the larger world. Believing that both politicians and corporations were corrupt, it declined to dirty its hands by talking to anyone in power. The takeover of the park -- especially as the police threatened to force the protesters out -- became an end in itself rather than the means to something larger. Occupy was an insular movement, whose members spoke mainly to each other.
The Tea Party did just the opposite. It, too, believed that politicians were venal, but rather than turning away from politics, its adherents worked to elect politicians who believed in the same things they did. Yes, the Tea Party had wealthy benefactors, but their money would not have succeeded without enormous grass-roots support. Two years ago, 87 new Tea Party-elected candidates showed up in Washington. Much as you or I may not like it, they have largely succeeded throwing sand in the wheels of government. That was their goal.
Timothy Noah, the author of ''The Great Divergence,'' a fine book about income inequality, says that Occupy Wall Street did succeed in ''massively raising the issue's profile,'' as he put it to me in an e-mail. There is more discussion now about income inequality, he added, than during the entire quarter-century the income gap was widening.
That is nothing to sneeze at, I suppose, but raising the issue is the easy part. The hard part is doing something about it. Without political engagement by those who want to reverse income inequality, it will continue to widen.
Occupy Wall Street gave us a memorable slogan -- ''the 99 percent.'' But you know what they say. Talk is cheap.

HEADLINE: After Life in New York, Banker Returns to India for Turn at Fashion

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
NEW DELHI
AS an investment banker in New York City, Poornima Vardhan had all the right clothes: power suits, cocktail dresses and jeans. Then she returned to India and realized that her wardrobe was as bland as an American breakfast.
For women like Ms. Vardhan who move easily between Asia and the West, India's vast and vibrant array of traditional clothing styles presents an unusual sartorial challenge. ''My wardrobe had to expand by at least 50 percent when I came back,'' said Ms. Vardhan, 28. ''There's a lot more diversity to the clothing needed in India.''
Ms. Vardhan is one of tens of thousands of recent ''repats'' -- Indians who left for educational or work opportunities abroad but then returned as India's economy began to boom. Such repats often face daunting challenges readjusting to India's chaos and corruption, and many end up leaving India again in frustration. 
But women confront an additional challenge that their male counterparts do not: remaking their wardrobes. For Ms. Vardhan, the style adjustment is central to her return. She came back in part because she was convinced that India's rapidly growing retail clothing industry was a perfect business opportunity. She is now the general manager for brand strategy and retail planning for Genesis Colors, a leading Indian fashion house. As part of the job, she has taken charge of the handbag business for Satya Paul, one of the fashion brands managed by Genesis.
''I miss New York, the buzz of the city, the drive and excitement that only New York can offer,'' she said. ''But Delhi will always be home for me. It's where my family and most of my friends are, and it's amazing being near them again.''
Professionally, going from finance to fashion has been more challenging than she expected. ''Now I have to think creatively and have an entrepreneurial mind-set, unlike in investment banking,'' she said.
The opportunity in India results not just from the nation's growing economy and rising middle class but because India, unlike most other emerging countries, has managed to retain its clothing traditions even among the upper classes. Although bluejeans are now popular here, their sales are still dwarfed by those of saris.
WHY India's distinctive clothing styles have managed to survive the cultural onslaught from the West is something of a mystery. Untangling that mystery could make some businesses very successful. So, too, could predicting which of India's remarkable styles will not only survive over the long term here, but also win adoption in the rest of the world. Ms. Vardhan is hoping that one of those businesses will be Genesis Colors.
And so Ms. Vardhan is expanding her own wardrobe, trying to fully embrace some of the bright colors and elegant silhouettes of India's traditional clothing. Having a foot in two worlds also means owning a lot of shoes.
While some returnees complain about needing more closet space, that has not been a problem for Ms. Vardhan. She recently moved out of her parents' house and into a two-bedroom apartment of her own, somewhat unusual for a single woman in India. Her father owns an aviation consulting business and her mother is a teacher. Her sister lives in London and works as a business strategy consultant.
Standing in her nearly empty apartment in Gurgaon, a rapidly growing neighborhood south of New Delhi, she described one of her first purchases after arriving home in April. It was a bright yellow sleeveless cotton kurta with white churidar pajamas. ''I bought several of these outfits right after I moved back,'' Ms. Vardhan said. ''And it's what I wear on a regular basis to work.''
Kurtas are long shirts with split front and back panels that usually extend to mid-thigh; they are worn by both men and women. Churidar pajamas are light cotton pants with wide drawstring waists and narrow leggings that bunch at the ankles.
Together, the pieces make an outfit, churidar-kurta. Like the similar shalwar kameez, it is both modest and cool, essential in a place where summertime temperatures routinely reach 120 degrees. Ms. Vardhan's pajamas are so lightweight they are see-through, but the long kurta ensures modesty.
''This is one of my favorite outfits,'' she said.
Modesty is a crucial part of the adjustment to India. While the country has none of the strict clothing laws of some avowedly Muslim nations, a woman's knees are rarely displayed. A group of Muslim clerics in Kashmir recently demanded that female tourists refrain from wearing shorts. In Delhi, few weeks pass without some report of a woman being gang-raped, and even some prominent Indian women blame the victims if they happen to have been wearing clothing deemed immodest.
''A complete no-no in Indian modesty is to show legs,'' said Mukulika Banerjee, a professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics and Political Science and co-author of ''The Sari.'' ''Cleavage is fine but not legs.''
As a result, when choosing their outfits, women in India must make fairly complex calculations regarding place, culture and transportation. If Ms. Vardhan uses a driver and knows she will step straight from her car to her destination, she may show some leg and go sleeveless. If she uses a cab or must walk part of the way, she chooses more modest apparel.
LIKE many female repats, Ms. Vardhan finds that one of the most daunting challenges of returning to India is wearing a sari, a ubiquitous and graceful garment that -- because it is draped -- allows her to adjust her look to her environment. The sari is still by far the dominant women's apparel in India.
''I'm trying to wear saris to work sometimes because I think people take you more seriously when you wear them,'' Ms. Vardhan said. She bought several cotton saris for day-to-day wear but is still learning how to wrap them, a process she said has been unnerving.
She is not alone. ''Wearing a sari is like driving,'' Dr. Banerjee said. ''You only get better by doing it, but you're terrified the first few times you try.''
Ms. Vardhan's mother has given her several silk saris for formal occasions, some stitched with gold. Weddings are such an important part of Indian culture that some women -- like the perennial bridesmaid played by Katherine Heigl in the movie ''27 Dresses'' -- have closets choked with wedding saris.
Part of the trick to wearing a formal sari is displaying the garment's palla, where much of the needlework is concentrated. ''It's very different from wearing a Western outfit, where you zip it up and you're done,'' Ms. Vardhan said. ''I feel very grown-up in a sari.''
She said she has worn a power suit only four times since returning to India, when she met with people from her former life in finance. She has yet to wear some of her favorite finds from SoHo boutiques, including an evening dress that ends mid-thigh.
''I love this dress. I think I'm beautiful in it, and it reminds me very much of New York, which is a good feeling,'' Ms. Vardhan said with sad fondness. ''But you can't show this much leg here.''
She will store that and other dresses with her winter coats, taking them out only for her occasional trips back to New York. But she hopes some day to find a way to blend her favorite Western and Indian wear in a way that has a universal appeal.
''As the world becomes more global, I hope to strike the right balance,'' she said.

HEADLINE: South Africa Warns Against Violence as Protests Fester

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
JOHANNESBURG -- In an attempt to stanch a spreading crisis in South Africa's platinum and gold mining regions, the government said Friday that it would crack down on illegal gatherings and arrest people who congregate with weapons. 
South Africa's justice minister, Jeff Radebe, said at a news conference that the government would no longer tolerate violent demonstrations at the mines, which have been going on for five weeks.
''All those engaged in illegal activities will be dealt with swiftly,'' Mr. Radebe said, without elaborating on how this would be achieved.
Mr. Radebe said the unrest threatened to seriously dent the country's image as well as its economy. ''It appears now that the mining industry is at stake,'' he said.
South Africa's mines have been aflame since Aug. 16, when police officers fired on platinum miners in the town of Marikana who were engaged in a wildcat strike demanding higher wages from the London-based company Lonmin, which owns the mine.
The shootings killed 34 people, and 10 others died in earlier violence, including two police officers who were hacked to death by the miners.
South Africa has the world's largest reserves of platinum, and earlier this week the world's largest platinum producer, Anglo American Platinum, announced that it would shut down production amid the unrest.
Julius Malema, a radical youth leader who was expelled from the African National Congress earlier this year, has called for a national mine strike.
Workers holding spears and clubs have gathered at several mines, demanding higher wages. The unrest is the bloodiest to hit South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994, when the country held its first multiracial elections. While the end of apartheid ended white minority rule in politics, the country's wealth remains concentrated in the hands of whites and a few black elites. Anger over joblessness, deepening inequality and persistent poverty have helped drive the wave of unrest in the mines.
The government took action on Friday after weeks of withering criticism that it had reacted too slowly to the crisis. It let the illegal strike at Lonmin fester for more than a week, as workers gathered on a hilltop armed with spears, machetes and clubs. It did not act even after the two police officers, and two security guards, were killed. President Jacob Zuma was at a conference in Mozambique when the police shootings took place, and he did not return until the following day despite widespread outrage at the killings.
After earlier saying that the strikes were unlikely to affect South Africa's growth prospects, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on Friday called the unrest ''extremely damaging.''

HEADLINE: So Many Screeners and So Little Shampoo, but Are Our Planes Safer?

BYLINE: By JULIET LAPIDOS

 BODY:
On the Sunday before the Republican convention, Senator Rand Paul ranted against his least favorite government bureaucracy: The Transportation Security Administration. Addressing a crowd at the University of South Florida, he mimicked the backscatter-machine stance (arms up in the air, legs apart) and asked "Is this the pose of a free man?"
Outside the Paul family, I doubt many Americans subscribe to the idea that airport security lies on the road to serfdom. But Mr. Paul's vendetta against the TSA has some merit. Nearly 11 years since its establishment, there's plenty of evidence that the TSA is inefficient, and if not ineffective, at least less effective than it should be. 
The House Subcommittee on Transportation Security released a report on Monday that calls TSA operations "in many cases costly, counterintuitive, and poorly executed."Echoing security experts such as Bruce Schneier, the report says the TSA "maintains a reactive approach to security." After the attempted bombing of American Airlines Flight 63 in December 2001, the TSA required passengers to remove their shoes at checkpoints. After the discovery of the liquid explosives plot in Great Britain in August 2006, the TSA banned liquids and gels. And so on. The report notes, dryly, that "once a procedure is put in place, it is almost never removed." Airport security is a game of catch-up, and it seems the TSA rarely considers whether new technology obviates the need for annoying and intrusive restrictions.
Is it really necessary to ban shampoo and hand cream? Perhaps not. Kip Hawley, a former TSA administrator, argued recently in The Wall Street Journal that the TSA should eliminate the prohibited items list, with the exception of obvious weapons. "The list of banned items has created an 'Easter-egg hunt mentality at the TSA," he wrote. "Worse, banning certain items gives terrorists a complete list of what not to use in their next attack. Lighters are banned? The next attack will use an electric trigger." Banning lighters is just security theater-it just makes airports seem safer.
While the TSA insists on confiscating lighters, it's oddly slow to enforce protocols that actually make sense. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Congress instructed TSA agents to vet foreign flight students. They do; but there's a hitch. The Government Accountability Office said in July that "this vetting does not occur until after the foreign national has obtained flight training."
The TSA seems like a caricature of a wasteful bureaucracy, spending astounding amounts of money even during a sluggish economic recovery. A couple of highlights from the report:
In 2006 the TSA spent $29.6 million on 207 "puffer" machines designed to shake lose explosive particles. They failed to work in dirty, humid airport environments.
The TSA employs roughly 62,000 people, including 47,000 screeners, at a cost of more than $3 billion a year in payroll, compensation and benefits. But "there does not appear to be a correlation between TSA's staffing model and the number of travelers that need to be screened." The TSA workforce is larger now than it was in 2005 despite a "net decrease in the number of people traveling" domestically.
Given that Republicans dominate the subcommittee on transportation security, it's not surprising that many of their proposed solutions involve privatization. The report's concluding paragraph advises the TSA to "begin an immediate shift toward partnering with the private sector for passenger screening and other security operations."
Whether airport security personnel work for taxpayers or privately owned businesses seems, to this liberal, beside the point-although perhaps Rand Paul will feel more like a free man if the screener telling him to spread his legs doesn't depend on government-run health care.
Clearly, though, it's worth changing the TSA's approach. And luckily there's a security byword that sounds almost as good to Republican ears as privatization: Israel. Instead of banning beauty products, the Israelis focus on intelligence. Instead of asking passengers to remove their shoes, they interview them. Their technique isn't cheap, but at least it's logical, and no plane leaving Israel's international airport has ever been hijacked.

An earlier version of this article misstated Kip Hawley's gender. He is a man, not a woman.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Retailers Look North

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN and STEPHANIE CLIFFORD; Ian Austen reported from Toronto and Stephanie Clifford from New York.

 BODY:
TORONTO -- Nordstrom and Target are about to open stores in Canada, J. Crew and Tory Burch just did so, and Ann Taylor and Kate Spade are scouting locations.
American retailers extending their reach northward seems like the most obvious of moves. But until recently, the Canadian market was hard to crack for many companies. The Canadian dollar was weak, costs were higher, and with limited real estate development, it was difficult to find space.
''You can't just say that we are close in proximity or we both speak English, so it should be the same,'' said Blake Nordstrom, president of the Seattle-based Nordstrom chain. ''We recognize there are differences. That's probably why we've probably been slow in coming to Canada.''
Now, the door to Canada is opening wider thanks to a stronger Canadian dollar, a relatively robust economy and a loosening of the commercial real estate market, in part because of the downsizing of some longtime retailers like Sears Canada. Nordstrom said this week that it would open four stores in Canada in 2014, three of them in former Sears Canada locations. 
For American retailers, Canada's allure is basic: Sales per square foot at Canadian malls were almost 50 percent higher in 2011 than sales per square foot at American malls, according to Colliers International Consulting, a real estate research firm.
''Major Canadian markets are at historic lows for vacancy rates, and have been for four to five years now,'' said James Smerdon, director of retail consulting at Colliers. ''We have a much more conservative development financing and development industry in Canada. There's not as many lenders for retail and large-scale shopping center development, so finding access to capital is trickier.''
Here in Toronto, the Yorkdale mall is adding 145,000 square feet, in part to accommodate American newcomers like Kate Spade New York, Tesla Motors and Ann Taylor. The high-end mall has been a first stop for other American brands, including J. Crew, Crate & Barrel and Apple.
Anthony Casalanguida, Yorkdale's general manager, said the transition to Canada was not always easy for American companies. To help avoid problems, he and some of his staff members school the companies in the ways of Canadian retail.
The first lesson is to set realistic expectations about location.
The most desirable retail space is generally controlled by a handful of large property companies. These are, in turn, mostly owned by large pension or government investment funds, which are not interested in taking risks on untested retailers. The company that runs Yorkdale, for instance, is owned by the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Service.
As a result, many of the new American arrivals are moving into existing spaces or expanding through acquisitions.
Target acquired up to 220 leases formerly held by Zellers, a discount store, for $1.8 billion in 2011, and has announced plans to open at least 125 stores in 2013. It is remodeling the sites at a cost of $10 million a store, a spokeswoman, Lisa Gibson, said. Lowe's, the home improvement store, has placed a hostile bid for Rona, a Quebec-based chain, which would greatly expand its Canadian presence.
Mr. Casalanguida also warns American newcomers to watch their pricing and to load up on inventory.
Costs tend to be higher in Canada because it has a population of about one-tenth that of the United States's, spread over a larger area. But Canadians are familiar with many American retailers and their prices, and they don't want to be gouged on their home turf.
Shortly after opening its Yorkdale store last year, J. Crew found itself apologizing to angry customers for having raised prices in Canada above those in the United States.
The upside of the cross-border familiarity is pent-up demand. American retailers risk botching their Canadian debuts if they do not bring a healthy inventory to cover that demand.
Sears came to Canada in 1953 through a joint venture, and Costco came in 1986, Home Depot in 1992 and Wal-Mart in 1994 through acquisitions. All have learned another secret to the Canadian market: customization.
Walmart Canada carries just 20 percent of the merchandise available in the retailer's American stores, with items like wine gums and mini-pepperoni popular in Canada, a spokeswoman, Susan Schutta, said in an e-mail. Louise Wendling, Costco's country manager for Canada, said that stores here carried children's snowsuits beginning in July, and that items like skiwear and snowshoes sold well, along with ice augers for ice fishing.
Then there is the language issue. All product packaging must be in both French and English throughout Canada, and large retailers operating in Quebec are required to conduct business in French and to ensure that French predominates on signs.
Target and Nordstrom have not given specifics regarding prices and merchandise strategies. Mr. Nordstrom said his company would have to contend with different distribution arrangements for brands it now carries, along with immigration laws that will prevent it from filling its new stores with experienced employees from the United States.
Ms. Gibson of Target said the goal was to largely mimic American stores, with some small changes.
''We've heard loud and clear from our guests that shop across the border that they want the true Target when it comes to Canada,'' she said.
Some Canadian retailers and early American transplants are preparing for a wave of new competition.
Holt Renfrew, a high-end Canadian department store, is doubling its space at Yorkdale. Hudson's Bay, Canada's largest department store chain, is renovating many of its stores. Sears Canada plans to refurbish its remaining stores and change its merchandise.
At the lower end of the market, Walmart Canada has added many prices from $1 to $3 to emphasize its low-cost approach. And Canadian Tire -- which, despite its name, sells a wide range of home improvement merchandise, sporting goods and household products -- is also readjusting its product lines and marketing campaigns.
Allan MacDonald, senior vice president for marketing and automotive at Canadian Tire, said he welcomed the competition.
''It's very interesting that since several new competitors, including Walmart, have entered into Canadian Tire's market since the '80s, we've grown and become a better company,'' he said.
Consumers seemed interested in the new arrivals. Amy Rathburn, carrying a bag from the Canadian sportswear retailer Lululemon Athletica while walking through Yorkdale this week, said she drove to Buffalo about four times a year to shop at Target and eagerly awaited its arrival in Canada. Nordstrom, however, drew a blank.
''I don't even know what they sell,'' she said.
But the face of Judy Kates, another Yorkdale shopper, lit up when she heard the Nordstrom news. ''I really, really like that store,'' she said, adding that she shopped at Nordstrom during a recent trip to Arizona.

HEADLINE: Village Voice Is Losing Its Editor in Chief and Music Editor

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR and BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
After five and a half years as editor of The Village Voice, Tony Ortega announced in a blog post that he would be stepping down to work on a book about Scientology. The music editor, Maura Johnston, took to Twitter to say she was leaving the newspaper as well. 
Mr. Ortega said that he would leave next week and that staff members were available to handle the transition. No successor has been named, but Mr. Ortega said Christine Brennan, executive managing editor of the newspaper's parent company, Village Voice Media, was looking to hire in New York - a fact he said "should please all the writers out there."
That was a reference to the fact that Mr. Ortega, who came to The Voice from South Florida, led the publication through several rounds of layoffs as it confronted the headwinds buffeting newspapers of all kinds.
Michael Lacey, executive editor of the newspaper chain, credited Mr. Ortega with guiding The Voice through a tumultuous time.
"Tony Ortega did a great job for us and managed a difficult transition in a miserable economy," he wrote in an e-mail. "During that time he became the single most informed reporter on Scientology. No one is better positioned to write the book on that organization."
Mr. Lacey added, "His departure creates an opening for one of the most compelling jobs in journalism."
Mr. Ortega said he was leaving because the increased profile of Scientology - including the release of "The Master," a Paul Thomas Anderson movie about a Scientology-like sect, and a cover article about Scientology in Vanity Fair - made it a good time to shop a book on the topic. Mr. Ortega, who always wrote in addition to his editing duties, has published hundreds of blog posts on the religion in the last two years.
"I've been an editor in chief of The Village Voice for five years, and this seemed like a good time to try something else," he said. "I think we did a good job of focusing the paper back on New York stories, and I helped turn a weekly newspaper with a Web site into a digital enterprise."
Ms. Johnston, the music editor, said in an interview on Friday that, in her case, "the decision to leave was not mine."
Ms. Johnston, who began her career in music blogs, churned out a constant stream of Twitter messages and Tumblr posts each day in addition to her work at The Voice, which included editing the paper's music coverage and blog items by a stable of freelance and staff writers.
But she also embodied The Voice's tradition of thoughtful cultural criticism, and resisted the kinds of light, easily consumable items, like Top 10 lists and photo compilations, that tend to draw the most traffic online.
Giving in to "the Darwinistic page-view coverage of anything," she said, "is damaging to culture as a whole."
It was unclear on Friday who would take her place. Last week, Village Voice Media appointed Ben Westhoff, the music editor of LA Weekly, to oversee music coverage for the company's weekly newspapers, and Ms. Johnston's dismissal was widely seen as a result of a power struggle over the direction of that coverage.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Walmart Opts Out of City Mall After Facing Labor Opposition

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA; Stephanie Clifford contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The prospect that Walmart, the world's largest retailer, would open its first big-box store in New York City suffered a setback on Friday, with the company saying it would not be a part of a new mall being constructed in Brooklyn. 
''We were unable to agree upon economic terms for a project in East New York,'' said Steven Restivo, a company spokesman. ''We remain committed to bringing new economic development and shopping options to New York City, especially in the neighborhoods that need them most.''
The project, known as Gateway II, is being developed by Related Companies. Walmart and Related had never confirmed that Walmart was being considered for the location, but local unions, some members of the City Council and community groups had raised alarms at the idea of the retailer's gaining a foothold in the city.
''Walmart's withdrawal from Gateway II shows that when New Yorkers join arms, even the world's richest retailer is no match for them,'' said Stephanie Yazgi, a spokeswoman for Walmart Free NYC.
A ShopRite supermarket is now expected to anchor the site. A company spokeswoman said that it had ''been pursuing this location for some time and believe that we will be able to confirm the status of this potential site shortly.''
ShopRite is unionized, and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1500, which will represent ShopRite workers at the new store, said it was ''thrilled'' with the news. Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker and a vocal opponent of the prospect of a Walmart on the site, released a statement praising the decision to go with ShopRite, citing its ''responsible business practices.''
But Walmart, in a statement, made it clear that it was still interested in opening a store in the city: ''Two things remain constant: most New Yorkers want us here, and we remain interested in providing more convenient access to Walmart for local residents.''

HEADLINE: County Judge Strikes Down Some Restrictions on Public Unions in Wisconsin Law

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE; John Schwartz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A county judge in Wisconsin on Friday struck down much of the 2011 state law pushed through by Gov. Scott Walker that severely restricts the ability of public employees to bargain collectively.
Judge Juan B. Cols of Dane County Circuit Court overturned the law with regard to city, county and school district workers -- although not state employees -- ruling that it violated the federal and state Constitutions.
Judge Cols said the Republican-backed measure, which led to huge union protests, violated union members' freedom of speech and association as well as the equal protection of the laws by subjecting them to penalties not faced by nonunion public employees. 
In a statement, Mr. Walker said the state would appeal the ruling. ''Sadly, a liberal activist judge in Dane County wants to go backwards and take away the lawmaking responsibilities of the Legislature and the governor,'' said Mr. Walker, a Republican. ''We are confident that the state will ultimately prevail in the appeals process.''
The state is likely to request a stay delaying the ruling during the appeals process.
Judge Cols overturned the law, known as Act 10, even though the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld it in June 2011 on different grounds. In its 4-to-3 decision, the court rejected a challenge that the Legislature enacted the law without giving sufficient notice -- normally 24 hours is required -- under the state's open-meetings law.
Andrew Coan, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said that while he could not comment on the merits of the case, in general ''it is well within the scope of a trial judge's authority to issue an order declaring a state law unconstitutional.''
The case decided on Friday was filed by a public employees' local in Milwaukee and the teachers' union local in Madison.
''This is a sound decision by the court that upholds what we were saying all along -- that Act 10 violates constitutional rights,'' said Christina Brey, a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Education Association Council.
Judge Cols said the law improperly punished workers who exercised their freedom of association to unionize by limiting them to smaller raises (generally no higher than the inflation rate) than nonunion workers could receive.
The law cut back collective bargaining rights for teachers and most city and county employees, but exempted police officers and firefighters. Judge Cols noted that the law hurt the teachers' union and others by prohibiting cities, counties and school districts from collecting dues from employee paychecks and passing them on to unions, while there was no such prohibition regarding the public safety unions.
The judge wrote that the teachers' and nonpublic safety unions were similarly situated to public safety unions but ''unequally treated'' without any justification. Thus, he found a violation of equal protection.
The push for the law led to huge protests in Madison and prompted 14 Senate Democrats to leave the state to delay a vote on it. Anger against the law was so great that opponents collected hundreds of thousands of signatures to sponsor a vote to recall Mr. Walker, but he won that election in June.
Finding First Amendment violations, a federal judge in March overturned two provisions in the law, one barring government units from collecting dues payments for the unions and one requiring that every public employee vote every year in every union local on whether they still wanted a union.

HEADLINE: What Congress Owes the Constituents

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''A Congress for the Many, or the Few?'' (Sunday Review, Sept. 9):
In our diverse, complicated country, some people are unfairly neglected or unaware of the services or rights that are due them. People fall between the cracks. Our ingenious representative government is intended to deal with that problem.
Fred A. Bernstein writes that members of Congress should stop providing services to such constituents and stick to his narrow conception of legislative work. 
Being a representative means much more than simply legislating in some abstract sense removed from the people of, by and for whom the government exists. It means being the person who connects each American with his or her government. There are some who seem offended that agents of the government should want to help individuals; evidently, it undermines their ideology that government should not help, that government is the problem, as President Ronald Reagan famously said.
Of course, I am aware that for each person I help there are others I have not been able to help. Still, constituent service is my way of showing people that their government cares about them regardless of their station in life and is my way of beating back the cynicism about our ability to govern ourselves.
RUSH HOLT Washington, Sept. 11, 2012
The writer, a Democrat, represents New Jersey's 12th District in the House.
To the Editor:
We middle-class and working-class citizens know all too well that Congress operates for the benefit of the few who make large campaign contributions and finance PACs and lobbyists. Why else would Fred A. Bernstein's friend be forced to request help from her legislator after ''scores of letters, hundreds of phone calls'' to her mortgage lender produced no response?
As long as powerful corporate forces can pay to avoid responsibility for the effects of their activities on the economy and consumers, soften proposed regulatory changes to prevent such effects in the future, and delay meaningful execution and compliance with regulatory and legal policies, we citizens will use our only remaining tool, our votes, to push the government to work for the many, albeit one case at a time.
If such use of one citizen's vote could obtain a prompt, substantive reply to every mortgage modification request, certainly use of it would be more efficient. As it is, we can only hope that with every single request, one case at a time, Congress and powerful industry groups will learn to consider the interests of all citizen-consumers.
ANNETTE F. FISCH Ann Arbor, Mich., Sept. 9, 2012
To the Editor:
Fred A. Bernstein paints a picture of Congressional ''casework'' as undermining the purpose of the legislative branch. In fact, it enables and humanizes it.
When Congressional staff members receive dozens of requests for help on Social Security payments, veterans' benefits or mortgage defaults, it alerts them to the human effect on ordinary citizens of existing policy deficiencies, agency backlogs or economic shifts.
Yes, they request that the responsible agency remedy the matter if they can within existing law. But they also begin research, call for hearings and introduce legislation to address the situation.
Having worked with hundreds of Congressional offices, we know that casework is equivalent to the central nervous system's sending pain signals to the brain and demanding attention; it is the primary way that Congress preserves a degree of reality on the body politic it serves.

HEADLINE: Anti-American Protests Flare Beyond the Mideast

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Reporting was contributed by David D. Kirkpatrick from Cairo; Alan Cowell from London; Monica Marks from Tunis; Nasser Arrabyee from Sana, Yemen; Tim Arango from Baghdad; Nicholas Kulish from Berlin; Steven Lee Myers from Washington; Alissa J. Rubin from Kabul, Afghanistan; Kareem Fahim from Beirut, Lebanon; Fares Akram from Gaza; Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem; and Christine Hauser from New York.

 BODY:
Anti-American rage that began this week over a video insult to Islam spread to nearly 20 countries across the Middle East and beyond on Friday, with violent and sometimes deadly protests that convulsed the birthplaces of the Arab Spring revolutions, breached two more United States Embassies and targeted diplomatic properties of Germany and Britain.
The broadening of the protests appeared to reflect a pent-up resentment of Western powers in general, and defied pleas for restraint from world leaders, including the new Islamist president of Egypt, Mohamed Morsi, whose country was the instigator of the demonstrations that erupted three days earlier on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
The anger stretched from North Africa to South Asia and Indonesia and in some cases was surprisingly destructive. In Tunis, an American-run school that was untouched during the revolution nearly two years ago was completely ransacked. In eastern Afghanistan, protesters burned an effigy of President Obama, who had made an outreach to Muslims a thematic pillar of his first year in office. 
The State Department confirmed that protesters had penetrated the perimeters of the American Embassies in the Tunisian and Sudanese capitals, and said that 65 embassies or consulates around the world had issued emergency messages about threats of violence, and that those facilities in Islamic countries were curtailing diplomatic activity. The Pentagon said it sent Marines to protect embassies in Yemen and Sudan.
The wave of unrest not only increased concern in the West but raised new questions about political instability in Egypt, Tunisia and other Middle East countries where newfound freedoms, once suppressed by autocratic leaders, have given way to an absence of authority. The protests also seemed to highlight the unintended consequences of America's support of movements to overthrow those autocrats, which have empowered Islamist groups that remain implacably hostile to the West.
''We have, throughout the Arab world, a young, unemployed, alienated and radicalized group of people, mainly men, who have found a vehicle to express themselves,'' Rob Malley, the Middle East-North African program director for the International Crisis Group, an independent nonprofit organization, said in a telephone interview from Tripoli, Libya.
In a number of these countries, particularly Egypt and Tunisia, he said, ''the state has lost a lot of its capacity to govern effectively. Paradoxically, that has made it more likely that events like the video will make people take to the streets and act in the way they did.''
Some of the most serious violence targeted the compound housing the German and British Embassies in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, causing minor damage to the British property but major fire damage to the German one. The foreign ministers of both countries strongly protested the assault, which The Associated Press said had been instigated by a prominent sheik exhorting protesters to storm the German Embassy to avenge what he called anti-Muslim graffiti on Berlin mosques.
The police fired tear gas to repulse attacks in Khartoum, where about 5,000 demonstrators had massed, news reports said, before they moved on to the United States Embassy on the outskirts of the capital.
In Tunis, the United States Embassy was assaulted at midday by protesters who smashed windows and set fires before security forces routed them in violent clashes that left at least 3 dead and 28 hurt. Witnesses and officials said no Americans were hurt and most had left earlier.
The worst damage was inflicted on the American Cooperative School of Tunis, a highly regarded institution that, despite its name, catered mostly to the children of non-American expatriates, nearly half of whom work for the African Development Bank. School officials, who had sent the 650 students home early, said a few protesters scaled the fence and dismantled monitoring cameras, followed by 300 to 400 others, some of them local residents, who looted everything including 700 laptop computers, musical instruments and the safe in the director's office, and then set the building on fire.
''It's ransacked,'' the director, Allan Bredy, said in a telephone interview. ''We were thinking it was something the Tunisia government would keep under control. We had no idea they would allow things to go as wildly as they did.''
The school's director of security, David Santiago, said a group of staff members formed a posse armed with baseball bats to chase lingering looters away hours after the assault. ''Our elementary school library is burning as we speak,'' he said angrily as he and his colleagues sought to assess the damage. ''It's complete chaos.''
Thousands of Palestinians joined demonstrations after Friday Prayer in the Gaza Strip. Since there is no American diplomatic representation in Gaza, the main gathering took place in Gaza City, outside the Parliament building, where American and Israeli flags were placed on the ground for the crowds to stomp. Palestinians also clashed with Israeli security forces in Jerusalem and held protests in the West Bank.
Witnesses in Cairo said protests that first flared Tuesday grew in scope on Friday, with demonstrators throwing rocks and gasoline bombs near the American Embassy and the police firing tear gas.
Egyptian state media said Saturday that at least one person had been killed in Friday's clashes near the American Embassy in Cairo. News reports said that a 35-year-old man was killed by shotgun fire and state media noted that he had a long criminal record. More than 224 people have been injured in four days of street battles, according to state media, and by Friday at least 99 Egyptian security officers had been hurt protecting the embassy in Cairo.
In the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, where J. Christopher Stevens, the American ambassador, and three other Americans were killed Tuesday, militias fired rockets at what they thought were American drones overhead, prompting the government to temporarily close the airport as a precaution. The bodies of Mr. Stevens and the others killed in the Libya attack were returned to the United States on Friday.
In Lebanon, where Pope Benedict XVI was visiting, one person was killed and 25 were injured as protesters attacked restaurants. There was also turmoil in Yemen, Bangladesh, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, India, Pakistan and Iraq, and demonstrations in Malaysia. In Nigeria, troops fired into the air to disperse protesters marching on the city of Jos, Reuters reported. In Syria, about 200 protesters chanted anti-American slogans outside the long-closed American Embassy in Damascus, news reports said.
In the Egyptian Sinai, a group of Bedouins stormed an international peacekeepers' camp and set fire to an observation tower, according to Al Ahram Online, a state-owned, English-language Web site. Three people, two Colombians and one Egyptian, were injured in the ensuing clashes.
In Yemen, baton-wielding security forces backed by water cannons blocked streets near the American Embassy a day after protesters breached the outer security perimeter there, and officials said two people were killed in clashes with the police. Still, a group of several dozen protesters gathered near the diplomatic post, carrying placards and shouting slogans.
In Iraq, where the heavily fortified American Embassy sits on the banks of the Tigris River inside Baghdad's Green Zone and is out of reach to most Iraqis, thousands protested after Friday Prayer in Sunni and Shiite cities alike.
Raising banners with Islamic slogans and denouncing the United States and Israel, Iraqis called for the expulsion of American diplomats from the country and demanded that the American government apologize for the incendiary film and take legal action against its creators.
Anger over the film even reached Sydney, Australia, on Saturday. Riot police officers in downtown Sydney clashed with about 200 protesters who were rallying against the film, The Associated Press reported. The police would not immediately confirm injuries or say whether arrests had been made.
In Egypt, in particular, leaders scrambled to repair deep strains with Washington provoked by their initial response to attacks on the American Embassy on Tuesday, tacitly acknowledging that they erred in their response by focusing far more on anti-American domestic opinion than on condemning the violence.
The attacks squeezed Mr. Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood between conflicting pressures from Washington and their Islamic constituency at home, a senior Brotherhood official acknowledged. During a 20-minute phone call Wednesday night, Mr. Obama warned Mr. Morsi that relations would be jeopardized if the authorities in Cairo failed to protect American diplomats and stand more firmly against anti-American attacks.
On Friday, Mr. Morsi, on a scheduled state visit to Rome, called attacks on foreign embassies ''absolutely unacceptable.''

HEADLINE: Money-Laundering Inquiry Said to Be Looking Into U.S. Banks

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Federal and state authorities are investigating a handful of major American banks for failing to monitor cash transactions in and out of their branches, a lapse that may have enabled drug dealers and terrorists to launder tainted money, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
These officials say they are beginning one of the most aggressive crackdowns on money-laundering in decades, intended to send a signal to the nation's biggest banks that weak compliance is unacceptable. 
Regulators, led by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, are close to taking action against JPMorgan Chase for insufficient safeguards, the officials said. The agency is also scrutinizing several other Wall Street giants, including Bank of America.
The comptroller's office could issue a cease-and-desist order to JPMorgan in coming months, an action that would force the bank to plug any gaps in oversight, according to several people knowledgeable about the matter. But the agency, which oversees the nation's biggest banks, has not yet completed its case. JPMorgan is in the spotlight partly because federal authorities accused the bank last year of transferring money in violation of United States sanctions against Cuba and Iran.
In addition to the comptroller, prosecutors from the Justice Department and the Manhattan district attorney's office are investigating several financial institutions in the United States, according to law enforcement officials.
The surge in investigations, compliance experts say, is coming now because authorities were previously inundated with problems stemming from the 2008 financial turmoil. ''These issues may have been put on hold during the financial crisis, and now regulators can go back to focus on money-laundering and other compliance problems,'' said Alma M. Angotti, a director at Navigant, a consulting firm that advises banks on complying with anti-money-laundering rules.
Until now, investigators have primarily focused on financial transactions at European banks, most recently Standard Chartered. The authorities accused several foreign banks of flouting American law by transferring billions of dollars on behalf of sanctioned nations.
As the investigation shifts to American shores, the Justice Department and the Manhattan district attorney's office are moving beyond those violations to focus on money-laundering, in which criminals around the globe try to hide illicit funds in United States bank accounts. If these new cases follow the pattern of previous ones, prosecutors could follow up on regulatory actions with their own complaints.
Despite shortcomings, banks spend millions of dollars a year to guard against money-laundering. Compliance experts argue that violations are typically unintentional and often harmless because they aren't always exploited by criminals.
Still, prosecutors and regulators have spotted gulfs in the way financial institutions oversee suspicious cash transfers, according to the federal and state officials. Under the Bank Secrecy Act, financial institutions like banks and check-cashers must report any cash transaction of more than $10,000 and bring any dubious activity to the attention of regulators. The federal law also requires banks to have complex controls in place to detect any criminal activity.
The comptroller's office, JPMorgan and Bank of America declined to comment.
The investigations are gaining momentum as concern is growing in Washington that illicit money is coursing through the American financial system.
Back in July the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations accused HSBC of exposing ''the U.S. financial system to money-laundering and terrorist financing risks'' between 2001 and 2010. The British bank, which is also under investigation by federal and state prosecutors, is suspected of funneling cash for Saudi Arabian banks with ties to terrorists, according to federal authorities with direct knowledge of the investigations. HSBC officials have pointed out that they had strengthened controls to prevent money-laundering and replaced employees tainted by the allegations. Standard Chartered maintains that ''99.9 percent'' of the transactions under scrutiny complied with that rule and involved legitimate Iranian banks and corporations.
The case against HSBC alarmed banking regulators, who wondered if monitoring flaws could be pervasive in the banking industry. The comptroller's office, which lawmakers accused of missing warning signs about HSBC's weaknesses, has stepped up its scrutiny of American banks in recent months.
In April, the regulator issued a cease-and-desist order against Citigroup for gaps in its oversight of cash transactions. The order cited ''internal control weaknesses including the incomplete identification of high-risk customers in multiple areas of the bank.'' A person close to the bank attributed part of the problem to an accident when a computer was unplugged from anti-money-laundering systems.
Citi did not admit or deny wrongdoing, but said in April that it had already undertaken many of the reforms required.
Federal officials are now examining whether problems run even deeper and if criminals have managed to exploit these vulnerabilities. An example of how criminals can evade the system surfaced publicly in a federal drug case in a Texas court this summer. Mexican drug cartels hid proceeds from cocaine-trafficking in two accounts at Bank of America, according to law enforcement testimony in the case, and some of the money was used to buy racehorses.
Bank of America was not accused of wrongdoing, and the comptroller's office has said privately it is unlikely to bring an action related to the case, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Authorities have not disclosed the scope of their inquiries at Bank of America and JPMorgan, or the period being examined.
Any regulatory action against JPMorgan would be another black eye for its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, and the bank, which was rattled this spring by a $5.8 billion trading loss. That misstep brought additional scrutiny of the bank's risk controls and compliance efforts.
Last year, JPMorgan agreed to pay $88.3 million to the Treasury Department, which had accused the bank of thwarting United States sanctions by processing roughly $178.5 million for Cubans in 2005 and 2006. Even after bank officials spotted the questionable transactions in 2005, the Treasury said, they failed to report the problem to federal authorities. JPMorgan also made an improper $2.9 million loan in 2009 to a bank tied to Iran's government-owned shipping line, according to the Treasury Department.
In a 2011 statement, Treasury officials called the bank's actions ''egregious,'' adding that JPMorgan's ''managers and supervisors acted with knowledge of the conduct constituting the apparent violations and recklessly failed to exercise a minimal degree of caution or care.'' At the time, JPMorgan said that it had not dealt directly with institutions in Cuba and Iran and that it had merely acted as a middleman.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 25, 2012 

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the settlement of money laundering claims against the British bank Standard Chartered by New York State's top banking regulator referred incorrectly to the jurisdiction of the Manhattan district attorney's office, one of the agencies investigating the bank. That office prosecutes violations of New York State law; it is not a federal authority.

HEADLINE: Anti-American Protests Flare Beyond the Mideast
<BYL >By RICK GLADSTONE; Reporting was contributed by David D. Kirkpatrick from Cairo ; Alan Cowell from London; Monica Marks from Tunis; Nasser Arrabyee from Sana, Y emen; Tim Arango from Baghdad; Nicholas Kulish from Berlin; Steven Lee Myers fro m Washington; Alissa J. Rubin from Kabul, Afghanistan; Kareem Fahim from Beirut, Lebanon; Fares Akram from Gaza; Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem; and Christine H auser from New York.

 BODY:
Anti-American rage that began this week over a video i nsult to Islam spread to nearly 20 countries across the Middle East and beyond o n Friday, with violent and sometimes deadly protests that convulsed the birthpla ces of the Arab Spring revolutions, breached two more United States Embassies an d targeted diplomatic properties of Germany and Britain.
The broadening of th e protests appeared to reflect a pent-up resentment of Western powers in general , and defied pleas for restraint from world leaders, including the new Islamist president of Egypt, Mohamed Morsi, whose country was the instigator of the demon strations that erupted three days earlier on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 20 01, attacks.
The anger stretched from North Africa to South Asia and Indonesia and in some cases was surprisingly destructive. In Tunis, an Amer ican-run school that was untouched during the revolution nearly two years ago wa s completely ransacked. In eastern Afghanistan, protesters burned an effigy of P resident Obama, who had made an outreach to Muslims a thematic pillar of his fir st year in office. 
The State Department confirmed that protesters had penet rated the perimeters of the American Embassies in the Tunisian and Sudanese capi tals, and said that 65 embassies or consulates around the world had issued emerg ency messages about threats of violence, and that those facilities in Islamic co untries were curtailing diplomatic activity. The Pentagon said it sent Marines t o protect embassies in Yemen and Sudan.
The wave of unrest not only increas ed concern in the West but raised new questions about political instability in E gypt, Tunisia and other Middle East countries where newfound freedoms, once supp ressed by autocratic leaders, have given way to an absence of authority. The pro tests also seemed to highlight the unintended consequences of America's support of movements to overthrow those autocrats, which have empowered Islamist groups that remain implacably hostile to the West.
''We have, throughout the Arab world, a young, unemployed, alienated and radicalized group of people, mainly me n, who have found a vehicle to express themselves,'' Rob Malley, the Middle East -North African program director for the International Crisis Group, an independe nt nonprofit organization, said in a telephone interview from Tripoli, Libya.<PA > In a number of these countries, particularly Egypt and Tunisia, he said, ''th e state has lost a lot of its capacity to govern effectively.

Some of the most serious violence targeted the compound housing the German and British Embassies in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, causing minor damage to the British property but major fire da mage to the German one.

''It's ransacked,'' the director, Allan Bredy, said in a tele phone interview. ''We were thinking it was something the Tunisia government woul d keep under control. We had no idea they would allow things to go as wildly as they did.''
The school's director of security, David Santiago, said a group of staff members formed a posse armed with baseball bats to chase lingering loo ters away hours after the assault. ''Our elementary school library is burning as we speak,'' he said angrily as he and his colleagues sought to assess the damag e. ''It's complete chaos.''

Since there is no American diplomatic re presentation in Gaza, the main gathering took place in Gaza City, outside the Pa rliament building, where American and Israeli flags were placed on the ground fo r the crowds to stomp. Palestinians also clashed with Israeli security forces in Jerusalem and held protests in the West Bank.
Witnesses in Cairo said prot ests that first flared Tuesday grew in scope on Friday, with demonstrators throw ing rocks and gasoline bombs near the American Embassy and the police firing tea r gas.
Egyptian state media said Saturday that at least one person had bee n killed in Friday's clashes near the American Embassy in Cairo. News reports sa id that a 35-year-old man was killed by shotgun fire and state media noted that he had a long criminal record. More than 224 people have been injured in four da ys of street battles, according to state media, and by Friday at least 99 Egypti an security officers had been hurt protecting the embassy in Cairo.

Christopher Stevens, the American amba ssador, and three other Americans were killed Tuesday, militias fired rockets at what they thought were American drones overhead, prompting the government to te mporarily close the airport as a precaution.

HEADLINE: Advantage, Obama

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
Elections often turn on character moments and the slopes of lines.
They are about who a candidate reveals himself to be under pressure more than who he says he is on stage. And they are about the direction of change when the time comes to vote for change -- or to forswear it in favor of continuity.
Taking that into account, at this moment, President Obama's chances of being re-elected look stronger than they have in months. The Romney campaign seems to be coming off the tracks with no clear vision for how to get back on. 
Romney's panicky, premature excoriation of the Obama administration over violence in the Middle East -- a response that was factually flawed and widely panned -- only served to shake the fragile faith of those who might be holding their noses to support him. ''Anybody but Obama'' used to be an effective rallying cry. Lately, it's been more like ''anybody but Mitt.''
Remember: character moments.
It also doesn't help that Romney seems incapable of concealing his anxiety. He too often looks like a boy who just stepped on a nail and can't remember his last tetanus shot.
On a side note, it is a poetic twist of fate that a Republican candidate's crude response to irrational violence resulting from an anti-Muslim video could boost a president who nearly a third of Republicans irrationally claim is Muslim.
Now to the polls. A New York Times/CBS News poll released Friday found that President Obama had a three-point lead over Romney among likely voters and an eight-point lead among registered voters.
And NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls released Thursday found that the president had significant leads in the critical swing states of Ohio, Florida and Virginia.
Romney needs to win those states, especially given that his supporters are giving up on Michigan and Pennsylvania. Last week, The Associated Press reported that ''Mitt Romney's allies have pulled their advertising from Pennsylvania and Michigan while redoubling efforts in other battleground states.''
And, as The Wall Street Journal pointed out about its polls, ''Mr. Obama's support as a candidate is at or near 50 percent in all three states, suggesting that Mr. Romney must peel off voters who now support the president to win.'' In southern farm culture we would call that a hard row to hoe.
A CNN/ORC poll released Thursday found that 68 percent of Americans expect the economy to be ''very good'' or ''somewhat good'' a year from now, the highest percentage saying so since 2002. (It's not clear how many people think it would be better with a change in leadership, but I'd say that growing economic confidence benefits incumbents.)
According to a Gallup report released Wednesday, 30 percent of Americans said that they were satisfied with the way things are going. That wouldn't seem to be something to crow about, but last year that number was 11 percent.
And a Gallup report released Thursday found that Democrats were tied with Republicans on the issue of who would do a better job of protecting Americans against international terrorism. This is a change after Democrats had trailed Republicans on this measure by as much as 13 points during Obama's presidency.
That same poll found ''the Democratic Party leading the Republican Party, 51 percent to 42 percent, in Americans' perceptions of which of the two parties would do the better job of keeping the country prosperous. This is a switch from recent years, as the Republican Party was narrowly favored in 2010 and 2011 on this measure.''
Remember: slopes of lines.
The most stubborn line for Obama is the unemployment rate. It's stuck above 8 percent, which is not good. But a flat line is not nearly as deadly as one moving in the wrong direction. Whatever voters think of the jobs picture -- slowly improving or hopelessly stagnant -- it's already cooked into their calculations. And Romney has veered so far from his strategy of keeping the economy at the center of the campaign that he's losing the only advantage he had. According to the Times/CBS News poll, Obama has now erased Romney's edge on the economy.
The Christian Science Monitor asked Friday: ''Is Mitt Romney running out of time?'' It continued: ''Should we just call this thing for President Obama now? We're kidding, of course (hold your outraged comments, Romney supporters!). But, as the old saying goes, there's some truth in every jest.''
Truly, there is. No one can predict the result on Election Day -- overconfidence could devolve into complacency among Democrats -- but, at this point, it's hard to see a path to victory for Romney.
Charlie Cook, an independent political analyst, wrote Thursday, under the headline ''Obama's a Good Bet,'' that ''Mitt Romney could still win, thanks to the debates and outside events, but the president has the advantage.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Jobs Number Still Beats Predecessor's

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THE job numbers in recent months have been disappointing, encouraging Republicans who hope that the slow pace of recovery will cause voters to reject President Obama.
But buried in the numbers was one accomplishment that serves only to emphasize how poorly the American economy has performed since 2000. The pace of creation of jobs in the private sector during the current administration is now greater than the pace in either of President George W. Bush's terms in office.
Not that such an accomplishment is impressive. Since President Obama was inaugurated in January 2009, private sector jobs have risen at an annual rate of one-tenth of 1 percent. Before the last decade, there had not been such a poor performance for any entire presidential term since 1960. But private sector jobs fell during President Bush's first term, and rose at an annual rate of just 0.06 percent in his second term. 
In January 2001, when Mr. Bush took office, there were 111,631,000 private sector jobs in the American economy. Nearly 12 years later -- and after a gain of 4.6 million jobs since the number hit bottom in early 2010 -- there are 231,000 fewer jobs.
That performance, bad as it is, may look good to government employees. The number of government jobs has declined faster, and is still falling as squeezed state and local governments continue to make budget cuts. Over the last 12 months, private sector jobs grew 1.8 percent. Government payrolls fell 0.8 percent.
The accompanying charts show the performance of the job market in all presidential administrations since 1957. In addition to private sector jobs, the charts break down the government payrolls into three groups. In this administration, federal government jobs have risen at a slow pace, while state and local government jobs have fallen at rates not previously seen.
The Labor Department began releasing the number of jobs in public education in 1955. This will be the first administration since then to show a decline in such employees.
There are many factors beyond the control of presidents that affect employment trends, of course. The bulge in public school payrolls in the 1950s and 1960s reflected the need to educate baby boomers. But the number of school-age children in the United States is still growing, even if the number of teachers is not.
Over all, jobs have risen at a faster rate under Democrats than Republicans, as former President Bill Clinton emphasized at the Democratic convention. Some of that may be luck, reflecting economic cycles. Mr. Clinton had the good fortune to enter office when the economy was weak, and to leave just as a great boom was ending.
Another way to look at the job trend is to see the changing proportion of government jobs to total jobs. For most of the period after World War II, that proportion rose, with the largest gain coming during Dwight Eisenhower's second term.
The first administration to actually see it fall -- that is, to see private sector payrolls rise more rapidly than public ones -- was Jimmy Carter's, from 1977 to 1981. The ratio continued to decline under Ronald Reagan, but bounced up a little under George H. W. Bush. Then it fell under Mr. Clinton but rose under George W. Bush. It has fallen under President Obama.
As least based on job totals, the big-government image of Democrats was accurate during the 1960s, but not since. There have been 11 administrations since Lyndon B. Johnson left office in 1969. The share of government jobs rose during five of the seven Republican administrations, and fell during each of the four Democratic ones.
CHARTS: The Job Score: Government jobs have been most affected during the current economic cycle, and they continue to decline while private sector employment recovers at a moderate rate. The top chart shows the percentage of jobs held by public sector employees since 1957. In recent decades, that proportion has tended to fall under Democratic presidents and rise under Republican ones. The other charts show the annual rate of change in the number of jobs during four-year presidential terms, and through August during President Obama's administration. While private sector employment is now a little higher than it was when Mr. Obama took office, overall government employment has declined at a rate not seen during any full presidential term since the reductions that followed the end of World War II.

HEADLINE: Fed Responds to a Grim Reality

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When the Federal Reserve's vice chairman said in a 1994 speech that the central bank ''had a role in reducing unemployment,'' colleagues were publicly dismissive. The very word ''employment'' did not appear in a policy statement until 2008. The Fed was focused on inflation, officials said time and again.
That era is over. The signs have been there for some time, but they are now unmistakable. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, made clear on Thursday that job creation is its primary concern for the foreseeable future. 
The remarkable transformation of the Fed's priorities is partly a response to the grim reality that more than 20 million Americans cannot find full-time jobs. It is made easier by the fact that the Fed has been so successful in stabilizing inflation right around the 2 percent annual pace that officials consider most healthy.
But as circumstances have changed, so has the Fed itself. Under the leadership of Mr. Bernanke -- with considerable prodding and support from a board almost entirely appointed by President Obama -- the central bank has gradually concluded that it has a responsibility to act more forcefully, and, equally important, that it has the ability to spur job creation directly.
These conclusions remain deeply controversial. Many monetary economists take the view that central banks should focus exclusively on controlling inflation, which creates an environment conducive to economic growth and job creation. Some argue that the Fed's efforts to spur job growth by decreasing long-term borrowing costs will inevitably result in higher inflation, eventually reducing growth and employment.
And it is clear that many economic problems are beyond the reach of monetary policy. The Fed cannot force Congress to budget. It cannot repair consumer credit nor change Europe into something more sensible. Even the most optimistic analysts do not think its efforts will return unemployment to its precrisis level.
Mr. Bernanke's predecessor, Alan Greenspan, once told his board that he did not want to mention job creation as a policy objective because the Fed would be making a promise that it lacked the power to keep. Mr. Bernanke, by contrast, has decided to make the promise and try to deliver on it -- not just because he thinks that it is within the Fed's power, but at least in part because he thinks it is important to try.
''Up until now the Fed has been very cautious in interpreting the dual mandate,'' said Stephen D. Oliner, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who worked as a staff economist at the Federal Reserve for more than 25 years. ''They have not really aggressively pursued a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. And what they're now doing is they're saying we're kind of rebalancing to put greater weight on unemployment.''
The evolution of the Fed's thinking has been visible in its public statements. It made no direct reference to the labor market in its policy statements until December 2008, according to a review by Daniel L. Thornton, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In January, the Fed for the first time cited the unemployment rate as a primary reason for a new policy.
When the Fed started its last major round of asset purchases, officials said they were primarily concerned about the risk of deflation -- the possibility that prices would actually begin to fall, with chaotic consequences.
On Thursday, Mr. Bernanke said the Fed was acting because of its ''grave concern'' about unemployment, including the long-term consequences for the many people and families that have now spent years without jobs.
In an important departure from past policy, the Fed also indicated that it was willing to tolerate somewhat higher inflation as the economy began to recover, although it remained determined to keep inflation around the 2 percent rate.
Some economists argue that Mr. Bernanke's actions are consistent with the Fed's longstanding approach, which has always struck a balance between inflation and economic growth.
''The actions are very different because of a very different situation,'' said Frederic S. Mishkin, a former Fed governor and economics professor at Columbia University. ''All of this I see as being completely consistent with what the Fed's mandate has been and what the Fed has viewed that mandate to be.''
It is clear, moreover, that Mr. Bernanke continues to consider low, stable inflation as the single most important contribution that monetary policy can make to long-term prosperity. The Fed is addressing unemployment in the same spirit that people use little buckets to fight fires: water is better than nothing.
Nor has the Fed changed its longstanding view that trying to minimize unemployment tends to produce inflation -- officials are confident that the economy has a lot of room to grow.
But other economists still see the focus on unemployment as an important rebalancing of the Fed's approach to monetary policy -- an attempt by Mr. Bernanke to combine the best practices of the last 30 years with a commitment to broader priorities.
The Fed's focus on inflation began in the late 1970s with the appointment of Paul A. Volcker as chairman. The nation was plagued by galloping inflation, caused in part by the Fed's previous focus on unemployment, and as Mr. Volcker succeeded in driving down inflation, and the nation prospered, his successors took away a simple lesson: Control inflation and jobs will follow.
Unemployment had faded from the Fed's vocabulary by 1994, when the Fed's vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, told a disapproving audience at a policy conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that job creation deserved the central bank's attention, too.
''There was an overweening concern about inflation compared to unemployment,'' Professor Blinder, who left the board in 1996 and returned to work as an economist at Princeton University, said in a recent interview. ''For many years, while the Fed had a dual mandate, it essentially never spoke about the unemployment part of it.''
He said he was glad to see that was finally changing.

HEADLINE: As Succession Talk Stirs, Ford Focuses on New Car

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DEARBORN, Mich. -- If Mark Fields is ruffled by speculation that he is the favorite to become the next chief executive of Ford Motor, he isn't showing it.
Mr. Fields was characteristically focused on Friday as he discussed another big product introduction crucial to Ford's future.
Mr. Fields said in an interview that he would not be distracted by a flurry of reports that Ford's board planned to name him chief operating officer and solidify his status as the top candidate to succeed the chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, when he retires. 
''In my case, I'm just going to do whatever I can to contribute to the profitable growth of Ford, and that means continuing to lead the Americas,'' said Mr. Fields, who has been the head of Ford's North and South American operations the last seven years.
Ford's board adjourned its monthly meeting on Thursday without deciding on a promotion for Mr. Fields or the retirement timetable of his boss, Mr. Mulally.
While the succession drama is hardly over, Mr. Fields is determined to stay centered on his current challenges like the introduction this fall of the redesigned Ford Fusion midsize sedan.
''You can't get complacent in this organization,'' he said. ''We have lots to do here, and there's no problem with things to stay focused on.''
Mr. Fields will play a crucial role in a multicity public relations blitz on Tuesday for the new version of the Fusion, a car that has come to symbolize Ford's comeback in the United States in recent years.
The Fusion was the third-best-selling midsize sedan in the United States last year, trailing the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Altima. But the market is getting tougher with the addition of updated models from General Motors and Honda, and Ford faces a stiff challenge to retain its share of the market.
Ford's sales in the United States have grown 6 percent this year, compared with a 14.7 percent gain for the overall United States market. That disparity has cut the company's share of total United States sales to 15.6 percent from 16.8 percent during the same period last year.
Mr. Fields has faced challenges like these before and succeeded, turning the Americas division into Ford's most profitable regional operation. Its North American business accounted for $2 billion in profits during the second quarter, allowing Ford to report $1 billion in overall earnings despite steep losses in Europe.
Ford, and Mr. Fields, can ill afford any hitches in the rollout of the new Fusion, which will be built at plants he oversees in Michigan and Mexico.
The company recently recalled another new model, the Ford Escape crossover vehicle.
A strong start for the new Fusion could reverse Ford's decline and add to Mr. Fields's credentials as a candidate for chief executive.
''It is an extremely important new product for Ford,'' said Aaron Bragman, an automotive analyst with the research firm IHS.
''It's going to be interesting to see if they can gain share in an exceptionally competitive segment.''
The new Fusion is sleeker and lighter than the previous model, and it will be available in two hybrid versions. Mr. Fields said he expected the car to get better fuel economy than the Camry hybrid, which averages 44 miles a gallon in city driving.
About a million vehicles will be built using the platform of the Fusion, including an international version of the car called the Mondeo and the new MKZ luxury model from the company's Lincoln division.
Globalizing vehicle platforms is a crucial tenet of the transformation of Ford under Mr. Mulally, who joined Ford as chief executive in 2006 after a long career with Boeing.
While Mr. Mulally, 67, has revamped Ford's product strategy and returned the company to profitability, without the government aid that bailed out General Motors and Chrysler, Mr. Fields has executed his plans in the Americas.
Mr. Fields, 51, has systematically improved productivity in the North American business by consolidating factories, cutting jobs and bolstering quality. His blueprint for the unit's comeback was endorsed early by Mr. Mulally.
''A lot of the nuts and bolts of what the company has done to change were Mark Fields's ideas first,'' Mr. Bragman said. ''Alan Mulally created the environment to get it done.''
Mr. Fields will play a supporting role to Mr. Mulally next week in the media presentations for the new Fusion.
While Mr. Mulally will be on stage in Times Square in New York with the television personality Ryan Seacrest, extolling Fusion's fuel efficiency, Mr. Fields will preside over a smaller event in Los Angeles.
That is fine with Mr. Fields, who consistently credits Mr. Mulally for ending strife among Ford executives and establishing a team-first atmosphere in the company, which is the nation's second-largest automaker.
''The way we run the company now is we all have accountability to each other,'' Mr. Fields said. ''We are all dedicated to continuing that because it's more enjoyable, and because it works.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Telecommunications Executives Deny Government Control at U.S. Hearing

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Executives of ZTE and Huawei, two of the largest phone-equipment makers in China, tried to dispel allegations by U.S. lawmakers that their potential expansions could lead to an increase in cyberattacks and spying.
But in what was described as the first appearance by Chinese executives at a congressional hearing, they heard accusations that they had not cooperated with an investigation or shown that they were independent of a government that has been accused of stealing U.S. intellectual property.
After the hearing Thursday, one member of the House intelligence committee joined a colleague in urging the Washington office of law firm DLA Piper to reconsider representing ZTE, citing ''threats your client may pose to the national security of the United States.'' 
In his testimony, Charles Ding, a senior vice president of Huawei, said, ''We have been hindered by unsubstantiated, nonspecific concerns that Huawei poses a security threat.''
The exchanges showed that the Chinese companies might face more restrictions on supplying telecommunications gear to power networks used by U.S. consumers, as well as banks, utilities and technology companies to transfer data around the country.
The hearing also showed continued tension between the United States and China. In Washington, the U.S. ambassador, Gary Locke, said that the renminbi needed to appreciate against the dollar. The Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, has said that if elected, he would label China as a currency manipulator on his first day in office.
Huawei and ZTE, both based in Shenzhen, told lawmakers at the hearing that the companies were not controlled by the Chinese government. Mike McConnell, former U.S. director of national intelligence, has called China the ''the most prolific'' state thief of U.S. intellectual property.
But the committee chairman, Representative Mike Rogers, a Republican, said during the hearing that the companies had not provided full answers and had supplied ''very few'' documents that related to the committee's inquiry.
''We need answers to very specific questions. And when they don't answer those, it just raises more suspicions,'' Mr. Rogers said after the hearing.
''There's concern because the Chinese government can use these companies and use their technology to get information,'' said Representative Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat on the panel.
But Huawei's founder and chief executive, Ren Zhengfei, said the United States would ''eventually'' accept the company.
''The U.S. still needs time to understand us,'' Mr. Ren said in an e-mail sent out by Huawei after the hearing.
''The U.S. is such a big country, after we explain everything clearly to Texas, we need to explain again to Virginia, and then Boston. It will be a long process.''
Zhu Jinyun, ZTE's senior vice president for North America and Europe, said that ZTE had set ''a new standard for a Chinese company in cooperating with the U.S. government.''
The Republican representatives Sue Myrick of North Carolina, a member of the intelligence committee, and Frank Wolf of Virginia wrote to DLA Piper to say they were disappointed the law firm was advising ZTE.
Ms. Myrick and Mr. Wolf said that ZTE had appeared to violate U.S. sanctions by selling equipment that would allow the Iranian government to monitor mobile, landline and Internet communications.
DLA Piper had no comment, John Merrigan, a Washington-based partner, said in an e-mail.
During the hearing, Mr. Zhu, the ZTE executive, told Ms. Myrick that the company had not sold gear to the Iranian government.
''We conduct normal business operations in Iran, but we are gradually reducing our present operations, and we are not starting any new business operations in Iran,'' Mr. Zhu said.
Mr. Zhu also testified Thursday that ZTE was not state-owned or government-controlled. But according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, an independent body that advises Congress, government- affiliated entities appear to retain a majority of ZTE's stock.
Mr. Ren founded Huawei in 1987 after leaving the Chinese military, building it into the world's second-largest maker of equipment for phone networks, after Ericsson of Sweden.
Mr. Ren's military record and his selection to the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1982 have been cited by U.S. lawmakers as reasons why Huawei might pose a threat.
According to the company, though, Mr. Ren has not maintained any ties with the military since his retirement and the government and military hold no stake in Huawei.
In 2010, Mr. Locke, then-Commerce Secretary, expressed concern about Huawei's participation in bids for a network upgrade by the U.S. company Sprint Nextel. Sprint Nextel instead awarded the contract, worth as much as $5 billion, to companies from France, Sweden and South Korea.
In 2008, Huawei and Bain Capital dropped a bid to buy a computer equipment maker, 3Com, after U.S. officials opposed the transaction. Last year, Huawei withdrew from purchasing patents from a computer-services company, 3Leaf, after U.S. objections.
About 70 percent of Huawei's $32 billion revenue comes from outside China, Mr. Ding said in his testimony. Huawei is owned by its employees, and the Chinese government ''has no influence over Huawei's daily operations, investment decisions, profit distributions, or staffing,'' he said.
In an interview after the hearing, Mr. Ding added that Huawei would remain in the United States. ''We'll be in the U.S. forever,'' he said. ''We have customers here.''
The company sells handsets and other telecommunications equipment and is seeking to sell network equipment in the United States, Mr. Ding said.
''I did my best to answer all the questions,'' Ding said. ''I understand they have concerns about companies from China.''

HEADLINE: Fed Action Keeps Rally Going for a 4th Day

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stock indexes rose for a fourth consecutive session on Friday to close out the week at nearly five-year highs after the Federal Reserve took bold action to spur the economy, a move that could keep equities buoyed in the coming months.
Shares of Apple, the largest American company by market value, ended at a record, and Exxon Mobil, the second-biggest, hit a four-year high. Apple closed at $691.28, up $8.30, and Exxon at $92.30, up $1.07. 
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index each closed at their highest levels since December 2007, while the Nasdaq composite index ended at the highest since November 2000.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 53.51 points, or 0.40 percent, to 13,593.37. The S.& P. 500 closed up 5.78 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,465.77. The Nasdaq composite index gained 28.12 points, or 0.89 percent, to 3,183.95.
For the week, the Dow rose 2.2 percent, the S.& P. climbed 1.9 percent and the Nasdaq added 1.5 percent. The S.& P. is now just 6 percent below its record closing high of 1,565.15 despite a relatively weak economy and economic risks around the world.
Equities are in a run-up that has pushed the S.& P. 500 higher for four consecutive months. The extended advance has come mainly from actions by the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low and stimulate their struggling economies.
The Fed said Thursday that it would keep up its aggressive bond-buying until unemployment fell. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said he wanted to see a convincing improvement in the economy that could deliver sustainable job creation.
Mr. Bernanke's comments are ''going to create an artificial floor on the market, meaning that we could see higher prices over time,'' said Paul J. Nolte, managing director at Dearborn Partners in Chicago. ''Any correction that we get will be no more than a few percentage points.''
The Fed's balance sheet could expand by 11 to 12 percent by the end of the year, monetary accommodation that could ''translate into a move up in the S.& P. 500-stock index to the 1,505 area,'' said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wis.
Energy and material stocks led the gains as the Fed's move bolstered commodity prices. The mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold rose 2.03 percent, to $42.64, and aluminum company Alcoa advanced 2.18 percent, to $9.84. The S.& P.'s energy sector index rose 1.3 percent and its materials sector index was up 1.2 percent.
Economic data released Friday helped justify the Fed's decision to introduce a third round of bond purchases to try to lower borrowing costs and spur growth.
A jump in the cost of gasoline pushed consumer prices up in August at the fastest pace in more than three years and squeezed spending on other items.
Other data showed production at factories, mines and utilities fell by 1.2 percent, the biggest decline since March 2009.
S.& P. Dow Jones Indexes said UnitedHealth would replace Kraft Foods in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average after the close of trading Sept. 21. Insurance is already represented on the Dow by Travelers though UnitedHealth will be the only insurance stock with a health care focus.
The removal of Kraft comes after the company's plan to split itself into a snack company and a North American grocery business with the Kraft name.
Shares of UnitedHealth rose 0.67 percent, to $54.25, and Kraft slipped 0.5 percent, to $39.93.
Shares of Staples were up 2.09 percent, to $12.21, after Fortune magazine reported that several private equity firms are considering a buyout offer for the retailer.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 1 10/32, to 97 26/32, and the yield rose to 1.87 from 1.72 late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Obama Is Erasing Romney's Edge on Economy

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Allison Kopicki, Marina Stefan and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
President Obama has taken away Mitt Romney's longstanding advantage as the candidate voters say is most likely to restore the economy and create jobs, according to the latest poll by The New York Times and CBS News, which found a modest sense of optimism among Americans that White House policies are working.
But while the climate for Mr. Obama has improved since midsummer, and Mr. Romney has failed to shift sentiment decisively in his favor, the poll found that the presidential race is narrowly divided. The outcome could still turn on unexpected events and how the candidates are perceived after their three debates next month.
With their conventions behind them and the general election campaign fully engaged, the Democratic Party is viewed more favorably than the Republican Party. The poll also found that more likely voters give an edge to Mr. Obama on foreign policy, Medicare and addressing the challenges of the middle class. The only major issue on which Mr. Romney held an advantage was handling the federal budget deficit. 
The nationwide poll was conducted during a turbulent week in the campaign, with a new torrent of television ads from Mr. Romney, a disappointing jobs report for Mr. Obama and both candidates reacting to deadly violence in Egypt, Libya and across the Arab world.
Among those considered most likely to vote, the president was the choice of 49 percent to 46 percent for Mr. Romney, including those who said they were leaning in one direction or another. It is within the survey's margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for each candidate.
The president holds a 10-point advantage on who would do a better job handling foreign policy, with 4 in 10 voters very confident of Mr. Obama's ability to handle an international crisis, compared with about one-quarter who say the same about Mr. Romney. The survey was largely conducted before foreign affairs took on heightened importance when the United States ambassador to Libya and three other Americans there were killed on Tuesday.
While the poll reflects a prevailing sentiment among Mr. Romney's advisers that he must find a way to change the dynamics of the race, the findings also highlight a lingering discontent running through the electorate. A slim majority of likely voters still disapprove of how Mr. Obama has handled the economy and 7 in 10 rank the economy as fairly bad or very bad.
But with only two weeks before the first wave of early voting begins in some states, the presidential race has taken on a new sense of urgency, the poll found, with enthusiasm increasing among voters. A plea for patience, which Mr. Obama delivered at the Democratic convention, appears to be resonating with some voters.
''I believe the country is going in the right direction, little by little,'' Anita Young, 42, an independent voter from Ardmore, Pa., said in a follow-up interview. ''Are things moving fast enough? No, of course not, but Rome wasn't built in a day.''
The president's job approval rating of 51 percent among all Americans marks the first time he has surpassed a majority in the poll by The Times and CBS News since immediately after Osama bin Laden was killed, in May 2011. The number of adults who say the country is on the right track has increased to 40 percent, though 54 percent say it is on the wrong track.
The coalition that helped sweep Mr. Obama into office four years ago is at least partly intact. He holds a 12-point advantage among women, while Mr. Romney holds the upper hand among men by 8 percentage points. But independent voters, who supported Mr. Obama by eight percentage points in 2008, are now breaking for Mr. Romney by six percentage points.
The poll found that a majority of voters embrace the president's vision of a country that emphasizes community and shared responsibility over self-reliance and individual responsibility, a distinction at the core of the debate between the Republican and Democratic tickets about the proper role of government.
But with the nation's unemployment rate still above 8 percent, a recent spike in gas prices and another impending budget showdown in Washington, a cloud of pessimism still looms, which creates an opening for Mr. Romney among frustrated voters who are looking for a change.
Looking forward, 45 percent of likely voters say they believe the next generation of Americans will be worse off and 31 percent say it will be better. On this question, there is a sharp divide among race, with black men and women far more hopeful about the future than white men and women.
When asked who understands their needs and problems, Mr. Obama has a 20-point advantage over Mr. Romney among women, compared to an 8-point advantage among men. Since a Times/CBS News poll in early March, Mr. Romney has made significant gains with voters in finding a personal connection and showing empathy; the latest survey finds 46 percent of likely voters say he understands their challenges and 48 percent say he does not.
''We're getting further behind,'' said Gregory Sowin, 55, an independent voter from Kewaskum, Wis., who owns a bar and a construction business and is frustrated by health care and other policies of the administration. In a follow-up interview, he said, ''Romney can't do any worse than Obama has done, and I'm betting my future that he can do better.''
This is the first poll by The Times and CBS News of the election cycle to take a measure of those considered most likely to vote. The nationwide telephone survey was conducted from Sept. 8 through 12 among 1,170 registered voters, including those who were weighted by their responses to questions about voting history, attention to the campaign and likelihood of voting.
Among the wider spectrum of registered voters in this poll after the Democratic National Convention last week, Mr. Obama has a stronger command of the race. The poll found that 51 percent of those voters supported Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., while 43 percent supported Mr. Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.
But among the probable electorate, which models likely voters and typically reflects the tendency of Republicans to turn out more consistently at the polls, the candidates are running far closer. When these likely voters were asked about the trajectory of the United States over the last four years, 35 percent said the country was better off, 41 percent said the country was worse off and 23 percent said it was about the same.
The president's base of supporters is more enthusiastic and loyal, with 62 percent saying they will vote for him because they like him and 30 percent because they dislike Mr. Romney. But among Mr. Romney's supporters, 50 percent say they like him and 39 percent say they are supporting him because they do not like the direction Mr. Obama is taking the country.
With less than eight weeks remaining until the election on Nov. 6, just 5 percent of voters have not yet decided which candidate to support, while about 1 in 10 voters who already support a candidate say they could still change their minds.

HEADLINE: Bailed Out By Obama, But Rooting For Romney

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
If there's anywhere President Obama should expect to get a boost from the success of the government's rescue of General Motors, it's Wentzville, Mo., and Lordstown, Ohio.
In Wentzville, a city of 30,000 people west of St. Louis, production of full-size vans at the General Motors plant had dwindled to a single shift by 2009. But last November, G.M. announced a $380 million expansion, and broke ground in May on a 500,000-square-foot plant where it will manufacture its midsize Colorado pickup. G.M. expects to employ over 3,000 workers there when the expansion is complete.
The automaker announced in August that it would build the next generation of its popular Chevrolet Cruze compact in Lordstown, a town of 4,000 people southeast of Cleveland. G.M. said it would spend $220 million to upgrade the plant and pledged to at least maintain the 4,500 jobs now there. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. visited a local union hall on Aug. 31 to extol G.M.'s progress. 
Ohio and Missouri are traditionally important swing states. But in St. Charles County, where Wentzville is, it's not Mr. Obama but his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, who is predicted to win by a large margin. In heavily Democratic Lordstown, Mr. Obama is expected to prevail, but Mr. Romney is likely to carry two neighboring counties that also benefit from G.M.'s success.
''That's surprising,'' John Weaver, a political consultant and former John McCain adviser, told me this week. ''I think especially with swing voters, they look at the auto industry and they see that government did work for them. It's not just Wall Street that got help. It worked in a practical way in an industry that's important to their state.'' (Mr. Weaver isn't working on the Romney campaign.)
I spoke this week with residents of both towns, and no one disputed that, from their perspective, the G.M. rescue has been a success.
''G.M. has been the catalyst for everything,'' Wentzville's mayor, Nick Guccione, told me. ''They've already hired about 700 people, and they're talking about bringing in over a thousand new jobs. And these are real jobs, with real wages. G.M. has brought in 1,300 construction workers for the new plant. We're told that for every job they bring in, that creates five more jobs. It's made Wentzville a more vibrant community. People can work, play, spend, shop.''
By many measures, Wentzville is thriving. In the two decades before 2010, the city's population grew to 29,100, from 5,000, making it Missouri's fastest-growing city, according to the city Web site. Mr. Guccione estimated that the current population was over 30,000 and said that per capita income and sales tax receipts had risen steadily despite the recession. A Sam's Club will be the country's largest when it opens in October, the mayor said. Voters approved a tax increase to pay for three new parks, and one of them, a large aquatic center, is scheduled to open next year.
Tony Thieman, owner of Thieman's Carpet Company and a former president of the local Rotary and the Chamber of Commerce, said his business was up 18 percent this year. ''I'm seeing an increase. It declined for three to four years, and now it's improving. It's not back to where it was, but I do see that happening in the next year or two.'' He's also a commercial landlord, with tenants that include a restaurant and a hair salon. ''Their business is up. It's a general positive swing,'' he said.
Like the mayor, Mr. Thieman attributes much of the town's success to G.M.'s survival. ''G.M. has been very active working with small businesses in the local area. I sell them flooring for their offices. They support the restaurants and local home-and-farm supply stores. We're lucky we had G.M. They kept people working here and the cash flowing. We've been fortunate.''
As for the government rescue, ''People were disappointed at first,'' Mr. Guccione said. ''They were asking, 'Why didn't I get a bailout?' But when G.M. expanded, they said, 'It worked, it helped. Maybe it didn't help everyone but it sure helped us.' ''
But none of this has necessarily translated into support for Mr. Obama. The mayor was elected on a nonpartisan ballot and says he is a political independent. ''Both parties, they don't care about the people,'' he said. ''They just care about being re-elected. As far as Obama, are people happy with him? No. I don't think he accomplished what he set out to do. Is Romney the answer? I don't think so. He doesn't have the answers; the only thing that would change is the name of the president. That's one man's opinion. I hope someone proves me wrong.''
Still, ''On the bailout, I've got to give Obama credit. It did work. But you can't judge a man by one thing.'' Mr. Guccione said he hadn't decided who he would vote for.
Mr. Thieman agreed that local support for G.M. didn't necessarily mean support for President Obama, in part because people are still bothered by the idea of a bailout. ''It's a touchy subject,'' he said. ''People don't like bailouts. I think G.M. has been a good thing for people here. But personally, I want to see everybody be accountable for the money and it get paid back to the American people. A lot of people here feel that way.''
In Lordstown, Mayor Arno A. Hill is a retired tool-and-die maker for Delphi, the former G.M. subsidiary, and was a member of the United Automobile Workers for 32 years. ''G.M. has carried this valley economically for years,'' he said. ''I'm glad the plant is still here. The whole valley is glad they're here. This is the best product lineup they've ever had. For every job at that plant, we get several more. That's what all the experts tell us.''
Mayor Hill said the area had been through hard times, but ''G.M. has helped us overcome this, and I do think we're looking up. We just opened up a big McDonald's and Chipotle Mexican Grill warehouse. The oil and gas boom could be huge for us. It's looking better, absolutely.''
But as in Missouri, Lordstown's resurgence doesn't necessarily translate into support for President Obama. Although Mr. Hill said he believed that the president would carry the county, where registered Democrats far outnumber Republicans, he noted that adjoining Geauga and Columbiana Counties were likely to vote for Mr. Romney, as they did for Mr. McCain in 2008.
''Most people would say that without G.M., we would really be hurting,'' Mr. Hill said. ''But to say everyone is 100 percent behind the bailout, that's different. A lot of people ask me, 'How can G.M. pay bonuses when they still owe the government money?' That upsets people.''
(Technically, G.M. doesn't owe the government money. It paid back its loans in full and the government took an equity stake in return for the rest of its money. But last month, the Treasury estimated that the government might ultimately lose about $25.1 billion on its investment.)
Despite his union past, Mr. Hill is a Republican, and said he was voting for Mr. Romney. ''I'm glad G.M. is here, and you can't rewrite history. But I believe in less government and lower taxes and that people should have personal responsibility. Government isn't the answer for everything. John F. Kennedy said, 'Ask not what your country can do for you.' That's what the Republican Party is saying today.''
Mr. Weaver, the political consultant, said he was traveling in the Midwest when the Wall Street banks were rescued by the government. ''People kept asking, 'Why don't you bail out the auto industry if you're bailing out the banks?' Now they're asking, 'Why didn't you bail out the dry cleaners? How come small-business people didn't get help?' If you're ideologically opposed to government bailouts, nothing's going to change your view.''
Such attitudes may help explain why Mr. Romney renewed his attack this week on President Obama's handling of the auto industry bailout. He has been an outspoken critic of the government's rescue of General Motors and Chrysler. In November 2008, he wrote an Op-Ed column in The New York Times arguing, ''If General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye.''
Mr. Romney argued this week on ''Meet the Press'' that the rescue wasted $20 billion in taxpayer funds that could have been better spent on ''teachers and policemen, as well as growing our economy.'' He vowed to press the issue in his coming debates with President Obama.
Still, Mr. Weaver said such arguments appealed only to the party faithful. He noted that in states like Michigan, where recent polls suggest the president is ahead, and in Ohio and Missouri, where local economies are improving in large part thanks to the auto industry, ''Obama is going to get credit for that. Romney should stop harping on the negatives and offer a bold and detailed plan for how he'd move the country forward.''

HEADLINE: That '70s hair: Ex-Governor's Turn On a Game Show

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
As the former governor of Michigan, Jennifer Granholm was in the driver's seat during one of the state's most economically painful periods, and now she's in the anchor's seat on Current TV. But before that, Ms. Granholm was in the hot seat as a contestant on "The Dating Game" in 1978. 
"Cute and curvaceous," as the host called her, the 19-year-old Ms. Granholm bounded onto the set in high-wasted pants, a puffy-sleeved shirt, and, oh, that big, seemingly weightless halo of blonde curls.
Although Ms. Granholm had long acknowledged her appearance on the show -- which came during her aspiring actress phase in Los Angeles -- the video only recently made its way to YouTube.
She got to choose one of three men. She rejected the penta-lingual contractor from Texas who told her what he did with a sponge in the shower. She rejected the textile salesman and magician from (where else, then as now?) Brooklyn, who told her about his other girlfriend, Betty Boom Boom. Though she couldn't see them, Ms. Granholm plucked the model from the bunch, who made her blush with a joke about putting spaghetti somewhere.
Ms. Granholm begged for forgiveness for her coiffure on Twitter.
"I was a teenager in the 70's!" she wrote. "My hair could've been a nest for an entire family of birds!"
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts and Economic Growth

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: A new report from the Congressional Research Service finds that "changes over the past 65 years in the top marginal tax rate and the top capital gains tax rate do not appear correlated with economic growth." 

 BODY:
My Capital Ideas column in this week's Sunday Review mentions a new report from the Congressional Research Service - a nonpartisan government group that provides analysis to Congress - on the relationship between tax cuts and economic growth. 
We have posted the report. The conclusion is below:
The top income tax rates have changed considerably since the end of World War II. Throughout the late-1940s and 1950s, the top marginal tax rate was typically above 90%; today it is 35%. Additionally, the top capital gains tax rate was 25% in the 1950s and 1960s, 35% in the 1970s; today it is 15%. The average tax rate faced by the top 0.01% of taxpayers was above 40% until the mid-1980s; today it is below 25%. Tax rates affecting taxpayers at the top of the income distribution are currently at their lowest levels since the end of the second World War.
The results of the analysis suggest that changes over the past 65 years in the top marginal tax rate and the top capital gains tax rate do not appear correlated with economic growth. The reduction in the top tax rates appears to be uncorrelated with saving, investment, and productivity growth. The top tax rates appear to have little or no relation to the size of the economic pie.
However, the top tax rate reductions appear to be associated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution. As measured by IRS data, the share of income accruing to the top 0.1% of U.S. families increased from 4.2% in 1945 to 12.3% by 2007 before falling to 9.2% due to the 2007-2009 recession. At the same time, the average tax rate paid by the top 0.1% fell from over 50% in 1945 to about 25% in 2009. Tax policy could have a relation to how the economic pie is sliced-lower top tax rates may be associated with greater income disparities.

HEADLINE: Sept. 15: Waiting on Wisconsin

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama's numbers in several swing states have risen, but Wisconsin, home to Paul D. Ryan, is a mystery, with no polls published there since the conventions. 

 BODY:
Saturday was a much quieter day for polling than we've grown accustomed to - and the FiveThirtyEight forecast was unchanged to the decimal place, with President Obama given a 76.2 percent chance of winning the Electoral College, the same as in Friday's forecast.
There was slightly more action beneath the surface. Mr. Obama's projected margin of victory in the popular vote declined slightly to 3.3 percentage points - down from 3.5 points on Friday, and from a peak of just over 4 points immediately after the Democratic convention. However, Mr. Obama's Electoral College chances held steady in the forecast because of a strong poll for him in Pennsylvania.
At the very least, Mr. Obama's lead in the national polls no longer seems to be growing. If he gained additional ground following the attacks on Americans in Benghazi, Libya - or from Mitt Romney's response to it - there has been no sign of it in the most recent national tracking surveys.
Instead, the question is to what extent, if any, Mr. Obama's lead has declined. The Gallup national tracking poll now shows him ahead of Mr. Romney by four points - down from a peak of seven. And there has been a clearer reversal in the Rasmussen Reports tracking poll, which has now reverted to showing a two-point lead for Mr. Romney.
Two online tracking polls do not show any signs of decline for Mr. Obama, however. In the American Life Panel survey conducted by the RAND Corporation, Mr. Obama had a smaller bounce than in some other polls - but it has held steady over the past week, as he has continued to hold roughly a three-point lead among likely voters. The RAND poll differs from others in that it uses a panel of the same 3,500 respondents who are asked their opinions about the presidential race continually throughout the contest; it is therefore subject to less statistical noise than other surveys.
Mr. Obama also enjoyed his widest lead to date, seven points, in the last version of the Ipsos online tracking poll, which was published on Thursday - although the poll has not been updated over the past two days.
There's also been a large volume of state polling to sort through. Our view is that the consensus of the evidence from these surveys has shown pretty good numbers for Mr. Obama - but not great ones - and tends to provide the most support for the hypothesis that Mr. Obama holds a lead in the national race of just under four percentage points right now.
The lone poll from a swing state to be published on Saturday was one to show more unambiguously impressive numbers for Mr. Obama, however. That survey, from The Philadelphia Inquirer, showed Mr. Obama with an 11-point lead there, up from 9 points before the conventions.
This is not the first poll to show a lead for Mr. Obama in Pennsylvania. In fact, the polling has been quite consistent there, especially as compared with other states like Virginia and Florida, in which there has been less agreement among the pollsters. Mr. Obama has held a lead in each of the last 23 Pennsylvania surveys, dating back to early February.
Intuitively, it might seem that the polling average is subject to less error when there is more consistency among its individual components. And in fact, I have found this to be the case in my empirical study of polls; less volatility in the polls implies more uncertainty about the eventual outcome.
But to the extent there has been a trend in Pennsylvania, it has favored Mr. Obama, with his lead slowly but steadily expanding over the past few months.
This may reflect Mr. Romney's on-again, off-again interest in competing in the state. According to The National Journal, Mr. Romney's campaign has spent nothing at all on advertisements in Pennsylvania since May 1, while outside groups backing him have spent a relative modest sum of about $10 million.
I wrote in July that I thought it was a mistake for Mr. Romney's campaign not to make a more vigorous effort to contest Pennsylvania. Moving the numbers in Pennsylvania is difficult, making it a high-risk proposition for a Republican who trails there - but it could also provide a huge reward for Mr. Romney, since losing the state would carve an enormous hole in Mr. Obama's re-election map.
But at this point, it may be too late. The forecast model now projects Mr. Obama to win Pennsylvania by about seven points. Given the consistency of his lead there, that translates into a 93 percent chance of victory on Election Day, according to the forecast.
It is in the blue-leaning states like Pennsylvania where Mr. Obama has arguably shown his best numbers since the convention.
Although New Jersey stretches the definition of a swing state, Mr. Obama had a safe-looking lead of 14 points in two polls published there since the conventions.
And in Michigan, two polls published last week showed Mr. Obama making gains. His lead expanded to 10 points from 3 in a poll published by the firm EPIC-MRA. In another Michigan survey, from the firm Foster McCollum White Baydoun, Mr. Obama reversed a four-point deficit to take a two-point lead. (That looks like a decent result for Mr. Romney despite Mr. Obama's gains, but it isn't really, since Foster McCollum White Baydoun has had an extremely strong Republican lean so far this cycle, showing results about 10 points more favorable to Mr. Romney than the consensus.)
All of this makes me very curious about another blue-leaning state, Wisconsin, which has not been polled at all since the conventions. Mr. Romney had appeared to draw Wisconsin to within about two points following his selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan as his running mate, making it among the most important states in the country.
But we just don't know what has happened to Wisconsin since then - whether the improvement that Mr. Romney had in the polls following his pick of Mr. Ryan was temporary, and likewise, how Mr. Obama's convention bounce has carried into the state.
If Wisconsin behaves more as true purple states like Virginia and Colorado, where Mr. Obama's bounce has been harder to perceive in the polls, Mr. Romney will be able to advance a stronger case that the damage he took during the Democratic convention has been tolerable. If the set of Wisconsin polls shows a clearer shift toward Mr. Obama, however, as in Pennsylvania and Michigan, Mr. Romney will be working from a rather thin electoral map.

HEADLINE: At Rally, Elizabeth Warren Takes More Aggressive Stance

BYLINE: JESS BIDGOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Elizabeth Warren, campaigning for Senate in Massachusetts, attacks the votes of the incumbent, Scott P. Brown, a Republican. 

 BODY:
BOSTON - During a rally on Saturday, Elizabeth Warren questioned the record and credibility of Senator Scott P. Brown, energizing a crowd of more than 700 people as the Senate race in Massachusetts turned more aggressive and pointed.
"Scott Brown isn't a bad guy, he takes some good votes," said Ms. Warren, speaking to a crowd at Boston University that appeared to be more than half college students and young voters, joined by middle-aged and older voters from the area. "But when it gets tough, when it comes down to the big votes that matter to working people across the commonwealth of Massachusetts, too often, Scott P. Brown has been on the side of the millionaires and the billionaires."

The rally comes the same week as both Ms. Warren and Mr. Brown introduced their first attack ads of the campaign. Ms. Warren's campaign points to Mr. Brown's record, trying to paint him as inconsistent while conceding that he is as personable as his own campaign has made him out to be.
In her speech, which lasted about 15 minutes, Ms. Warren went through a list of voting groups - including students, the elderly, women and the unemployed - contrasting parts of Mr. Brown's voting record with her own policy aims.
"Women," said Ms. Warren, addressing one of those groups, to cheers. "Scott Brown voted against equal pay for equal work and voted to block women's access to insurance coverage on birth control," referring to Mr. Brown's vote against the Paycheck Fairness Act and his support for the Blunt Amendment, which would have allowed employers to keep birth control out of employees' health insurance plans. 
"Me, I want to go to Washington to fight for women," she continued, bringing women and men around the room to their feet.
While the Brown campaign did not issue a direct response to the speech, an early-morning statement criticized the attack ad put out earlier this week by Ms. Warren's campaign. 
"We had hoped for better in this campaign," said Jim Barnett, the manager of the Brown campaign. "Scott Brown is beholden to no one. We need more independent voices like Scott Brown who will always do what is right for Massachusetts, and not cave to the whims of party bosses in Washington."
Ms. Warren ended her speech with an endorsement of the role of government in strengthening the country, a campaign theme that first gained notoriety in a video that became popular last fall.
"The vision of my Republican opponent and the Republican Party can be boiled down to this: I've got mine, and the rest of you are on your own," Ms. Warren said. "We are a better people than that."
"We came out of the Great Depression and what did we do as a people? We invested. We invested in ourselves, we invested in our kids, we invested in our future," Ms. Warren said. "We didn't know what the next great business would be, we didn't know who would start it, but we were pretty sure you were going to need to plug in when you did," she said, to some laughter.
At the rally, Peter Alvarez, a second-year law student at Boston University, echoed the criticisms of Mr. Brown.
"I think she did a good job juxtaposing herself and his votes," Mr. Alvarez said. "I think she needed to harp on, for the people of Massachusetts, what Scott Brown has done. He's only on our side when it's an easy vote."

HEADLINE: Obama Ad Tries to Answer: Are You Better Off Than Four Years Ago?

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: Recent polls have shown that more Americans feel that they are not better off. But President Obama is telling them that they are. 

 BODY:
A new ad from President Obama confronts head on one of the most potentially damaging questions lingering over his re-election hopes: Are you better off than you were four years ago?
Recent polls have shown that more Americans feel that they are not better off. But Mr. Obama is telling them that they are.
"Here's where we were in 2008," an announcer says in the ad, which is running in seven battleground states, including some of the hardest hit by the recession, like Nevada and Florida.
"The worst financial collapse since the Great Depression," a newscaster says. On the screen flashes "4.4 million jobs lost."
The ad then pivots to 2012 to make the argument that has been at the heart of Mr. Obama's case for re-election: that the country is moving in the right direction, albeit slowly. "We're not there yet, but the real question is, 'Whose plan is better for you?'"
Mr. Obama has been arguing not just that his plan to economic prosperity is moving in the right direction - forward, as his campaign slogan says - but that Mitt Romney's policies would take the country back.
This ad doubles down on that argument, pointing to Mr. Obama's plans to ask the wealthy to pay higher taxes and Mr. Romney's support for less business regulation. The ad also raises again a claim made in a study that Mr. Romney's campaign has disputed, saying that his tax plan would actually raise taxes on middle class families by $2,000.

HEADLINE: Reality Check From Honda, In Touch with Economics

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
LONG BEACH, Calif.
NO one would blame you for interpreting Honda's introduction of the 2012 NC700X as an attempt to bring some sanity back to motorcycling.
This model is, in many ways, the ''not'' bike: not a 175-horsepower sports machine, not a radically stretched cruiser, not some full-boat cross-continent touring rig. Instead, the new Honda -- new to the United States, that is, it is already on sale in Europe -- is aimed at the mainstream, no apology offered.
Sure, Honda lists it as an adventure-class entry, but Cycle World magazine's recent naming of the NC700X as its Best Standard motorcycle for 2012 is probably a better indicator of the bike's true mission. It is a tempting choice for riders who want versatility -- and don't need scare-you-to-death speed. 
Terrific fuel economy tops a long list of attributes that includes clever storage options, stable handling and a price that starts at a reasonable $7,309, including destination charges. Honda will offer a wide range of accessories to elevate what is essentially a no-frills bike in its basic form to one that is suitable for touring and adventure trekking.
My test of the NC700X started at the arrivals area of the airport here on a day when the forecast of zero percent chance of rain turned into a deluge. The stock windscreen, less protective than the proverbial fig leaf, provided little cover (a taller and wider screen is a $170 option).
The rest of the bike performed flawlessly over hundreds of miles of wet pavement. The suspension's 5.4 inches of front fork travel, and 5.9 inches at the rear from its single-shock Pro-Link layout proved more than adequate for coping with California's deepening array of potholes. I expected a blowout, but the tires put up a good fight against California's excessively grooved concrete freeways.
What really helped most in the wet, however, was not having an excess of power -- none of that pesky wheelspin. That's right: I'm extolling the virtues here of a rather pokey bike.
Honda said its research showed 90 percent of all motorcycle riders travel at speeds of 85 m.p.h. or less. So, that is where it placed the ceiling of the NC700X's sweet spot of performance for a global market. The NC700X can exceed 85, but time is needed to build up to that momentum.
Even when run nearly wide open all the time, the bike's stellar fuel mileage seemed to hold up. Honda says 64 m.p.g. fuel economy is achievable in everyday riding, but more -- sometimes much more -- is attainable.
On my four-hour ride from Long Beach to Las Vegas, I stopped hourly to top off the 3.7-gallon tank and assess the mileage. From sea level to roughly 4,000 feet in the Cajon Pass on Interstate 15, I recorded 61 m.p.g. I considered that impressive, as it was uphill much of the way, and I wasn't sure the tank was full when I picked up the bike.
For the next hour, across the Mojave Desert, the bike averaged 70 m.p.g. For the final two hours, over four mountain passes, the NC700X managed 72 m.p.g. (A tail wind may have helped.) Undoubtedly, riding at a lower average speed, with more prudent throttle use, would have produced even gaudier numbers.
On a wide array of motorcycles, ridden along the same test route over the course of several years, I've seldom observed fuel economy of more than 50 m.p.g. Something around 40 m.p.g. is more the norm. The Honda's result is all the more impressive because of its heft. At 474 pounds, it is no lightweight for a bike with two cylinders.
The NC700X is powered by a fuel-injected parallel twin that lays its cylinders forward at a 62-degree angle rather than placing them nearly upright. The undersquare design of the engine -- its 670 cc displacement is the result of a 73-millimeter bore and an 80-millimeter stroke -- helps assure a smooth delivery of torque, which peaks at a very low 4,750 r.p.m. Cost savings were realized by the use of branched passages for the intake and exhaust: only one throttle body and one catalytic converter is needed to serve both cylinders.
The placement of the cylinders, along with design possibilities opened up by a new steel trellis frame, offered plenty of space for a handy lockable storage compartment where the gas tank would normally be. It is large enough to fit a full-face helmet or backpack. (The fuel filler is in a small storage area atop the rear wheel.)
When outfitted with hard bags and a trunk -- also options offered by Honda -- the NC700X can be a real pack mule. Adding that equipment is not cheap, though, taking the bike beyond the $10,000 level when fully loaded. Two-up touring is possible, but the bike seems a bit small for that.
No doubt Honda or an aftermarket supplier will offer a more comfortable seat -- the stock cushion is hard as a park bench, and would be a pretty miserable perch if one tried to sit through the bike's full 250-mile fuel range.
Compared with more powerful motorcycles, keeping up with traffic on the NC700X requires more shifting of the standard 6-speed transmission. Fortunately, it runs up and down the gear range with silken precision.
Increasing the bike's appeal to practical-minded riders is the optional dual-clutch transmission, a second-generation design that offers three operating modes: full manual push-button shifting as well as automated normal and sport selections. The fuel economy estimate drops to 61 m.p.g. with the dual-clutch transmission and the weight increases by 31 pounds.
In part, that gain comes from the inclusion of integrated antilock brakes with the $9,309 dual-clutch model.
In most important regards, the bike is perfectly competent. It is agile, economical, well built and, because it is a Honda, likely to be very reliable. For the commuter, it can be a dream machine. For the newbie rider, it is a logical step up from a 125 cc or 250 cc model and a fuel-sipping mode of transportation.

HEADLINE: The Blog: Dealers Peer Into Chrysler Pipeline

BYLINE: By PAUL STENQUIST

 BODY:
Although Chrysler Group has made significant strides toward rehabilitating its finances since emerging from bankruptcy in 2009, the company has avoided the complacency that plagued it in previous times of growth. Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Chrysler and Fiat, introduced 66 car and truck models to the company's dealers at a meeting in Las Vegas on Monday. 
According to a report by Reuters, among the new models shown was a Chrysler 100 subcompact that would give the brand an entry in that growing segment; a redesigned Chrysler 200 said to resemble the well-received Dodge Dart; various Jeep models that mimic the styling of the brand's successful Grand Cherokee; and a couple of Alfa Romeos that would be sold by Fiat dealers in the United States.
"We are less than two years away from having an almost completely rejuvenated product lineup compared to what we could offer customers when we began this journey in June 2009," Mr. Marchionne said in a video of his presentation to dealers.
Bill Golling, president of Golling Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram and Golling Fiat, both in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., was in attendance. "We went out to the meeting with great interest and weren't disappointed," Mr. Golling said in a telephone interview. "I'm almost overwhelmed on how exciting it is for the future. What they're showing us now is very rewarding."
Asked if he thought a market existed for a subcompact Chrysler sedan, Mr. Golling said he could not comment on specific products, but added that in light of coming Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards requiring average fleetwide fuel economy of 54 miles per gallon by 2025, Chrysler dealers "would have a different portfolio of products going forward."
"I take a look at the things they're doing, and they're right on track," he said.
To illustrate his optimism, Mr. Golling cited a 9-speed automatic transmission under development for Chrysler's front-drive vehicles.
The automaker's market share in the United States has been increasing steadily since Mr. Marchionne took the helm in 2009. At the end of 2009, the automaker held 8.9 percent of the market. Its share currently stands at 11.1 percent.
"We cannot stop now," Mr. Marchionne said in his address. "We cannot afford to rest."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Dear Bankers: Thanks for Wrecking Our Lives...

BYLINE: By MARK GREIF. 
A founding editor of n+1 and an editor of ''The Trouble Is the Banks: Letters to Wall Street.''

 BODY:
TOMORROW is the first anniversary of the Occupy Wall Street movement's encampment at Zuccotti Park. Some of the protesters there created a Web site for Americans who couldn't join them in Lower Manhattan. Called Occupy the Boardroom, the site invited people across the country to write detailed letters to the executives and directors of banks. The site's developers promised to deliver them as e-mail and in person. 
The more than 8,000 letters that resulted (to Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citibank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley) supply some insight into the way different Americans experienced the financial crisis and recession since 2007.
The literary magazine n+1 collected 200 of the letters in a book, ''The Trouble Is the Banks: Letters to Wall Street,'' which appears this month. Mike McQuade, an artist, used excerpts from these letters to create this illustration for The New York Times.

HEADLINE: Two New Heavyweights in the Midsize Ring: Accord: Once More With No Nonsense

BYLINE: By JOHN PEARLEY HUFFMAN

 BODY:
SANTA BARBARA, Calif.
SINCE 1976, the Honda Accord has been the car for people who don't want their car to say anything about them. It doesn't boast or gossip or tell lies. It's not glamorous, showy or racy. It's a stalwart car that does everything well except call attention to itself.
The all-new and all-better ninth-generation Accord does nothing to betray that or the car's enormous, well-established and self-actualized customer base. The 2013 Accord, which goes on sale on Wednesday, is so thoroughly pleasant and capable that its buyers may even be tempted to admit enjoying it -- when pressed, and only after explaining that they never think about cars, and after consuming a couple of sensible cocktails. Maybe Manhattans or Old Fashioneds. 
The Accord swims in the deepest part of the mainstream where the currents have led virtually every manufacturer to the same midsize sedan formula: front-wheel drive, unibody construction, a wheelbase of about 110 inches, a standard transverse-mounted 4- or 5-cylinder engine displacing about 2.4 or 2.5 liters, a base price hovering around $22,000. In fact, one of the Accord's most distinctive engineering elements, the double-wishbone front suspension used since the third-generation model of 1986, has been sacrificed on the altar of conventional wisdom in favor of a MacPherson strut system like all of its competitors.
Honda says the struts are simpler and lighter and they now work as well as wishbones. After all, even Porsches and BMWs are using struts, too. As of now, only one Honda retains those once-beloved wishbones -- the low-production experimental FCX Clarity hydrogen fuel-cell car.
As before, the Accord comes as either a two-door coupe or a four-door sedan. The coupe is nice, but it's the sedan that sells -- most often as the base LX model with a 4-cylinder engine. My test car, however, was the EX-L sedan, near the top of the line with a V-6 engine, leather upholstery and a G.P.S. navigation system -- and a sticker price of $32,860. A new Touring model rules from atop the heap, at $34,220.
A plug-in hybrid model will be available in early 2013 as a 2014 model, with a ''two motor'' hybrid to follow next summer.
Honda didn't have an LX sedan with the 6-speed manual transmission ($22,470) at the press introduction here, mere blocks from my house. But it did have the 4-cylinder EX ($25,395) equipped with a new belt-driven continuously variable automatic transmission. At 2.4 liters, the in-line 4 is the same size as last year's, but now features direct injection of fuel and a new double-overhead-cam cylinder head with an integral exhaust manifold that feeds forward directly into a huge catalytic converter mounted just behind the radiator.
Rated at a robust 185 horsepower, the new 4-cylinder feels strong and runs relatively quietly. The continuously variable automatic saps some of the thrust, but is one of the sweeter examples of the breed, with a Sport mode that sharpens its reflexes. Paddle shifters to manually engage virtual gears on the C.V.T. are available on the new Sport model and on all of the coupes, though it is not available with the LX and EX sedans. Honda credits the C.V.T. for helping the fuel economy of 4-cylinder sedans to rise to an estimated 27 m.p.g. in the city and 36 m.p.g. on the highway.
The new sedan retains the traditional Accord proportions of a low cowl and raised rump, and the low window sills -- running counter to the recent trend of bunkerlike cabins -- contribute to good visibility and an airy feeling. The wheelbase has shrunk an inch while the width has increased just a bit. More heavily sculptured flanks make the new car appear more substantial while the front grille makes it seem wider. And LED headlamps make the car look more expensive and contemporary. But the Accord is still a car that blends into the sprawl like a Starbucks; you only notice it if you look for it.
The Honda's evolution is most pronounced inside. All new Accords have a standard rearview camera that displays in an eight-inch LCD display atop the center of the dashboard, and the various available media elements -- Pandora, Bluetooth audio, USB-linked devices, SMS messaging, perhaps even live miniature yodelers -- are covered by a second, smaller LCD touch screen below it.
The big kick, though, is an optional rear-facing camera embedded in the right side-view mirror. The camera looks back along the Accord's flank, providing in the larger screen a nearly panoramic view of the lane to the right whenever the right turn signal is engaged or a button is pressed at the end of the stalk. Honda calls this system LaneWatch, and it works brilliantly. Too bad there isn't a way to instantly post lane changes to Facebook.
But the lane-departure warning system was annoying after a few miles, and I turned it off.
The interior is restrained in design and executed in materials that seem both higher in quality and better tailored than most cars in this class. The rear seat is roomy enough for three across, but all the seat cushions are rather shapeless and lacking in thigh support. The buttons and switches operate with the sort of precision and determination expected of world-class biathletes. And the Accord is quiet. Very quiet.
Besides the buttery smoothness of Honda's 3.5-liter V-6 -- also found in the Pilot crossover, Odyssey minivan and a slew of Acuras -- every new Accord uses electronic technology to cancel out unwanted noise. Two microphones collect noises entering the cockpit, and a computer then generates a countervailing, out-of-phase sound out through the speakers to counter it.
With 278 horsepower, ample torque and a new sweet-shifting 6-speed automatic transmission, the Accord V-6 sedan rips to 60 m.p.h. in just 6.1 seconds, according to Edmunds.com's Inside Line. That's nearly a full second quicker than the previous-generation car and a tenth of a second better than the Altima V-6.
And the Honda V-6, which still lacks direct injection, an increasingly common technology for efficient use of fuel, does this while kicking back excellent E.P.A. numbers of 21 m.p.g. in the city and 34 m.p.g. on the highway. That's largely because of technology that shuts down up to half the cylinders when they are not needed. In 191 miles of mostly freeway driving, I got 28.7 m.p.g.
So the Accord is quick, yes. But sporty? No. The suspension is softly tuned and relies on modest 17-inch all-season tires that are built for fuel economy and comfort, not ultimate adhesion. With almost two-thirds of its weight on the front wheels, the Accord will push its nose through corners. The electrically assisted power steering has a light and precise feel, but it's not particularly quick. Four-wheel antilock disc brakes are aboard, but the lazy tires and an unloaded weight of more than 3,500 pounds conspire against particularly short stopping distances.
The basic designs of midsize sedans are so similar that it's tempting to lump them together and assume that each is as good as the others -- just go with the one that has the most features you like. And almost all of the cars in this market segment are very good. But this new Accord is excellent.
The lackluster Civic introduced last year made me question whether Honda had strayed from its true path. This Accord restores my faith in the company's chi.

HEADLINE: For India's Children, Philanthropy Isn't Enough

BYLINE: By SONIA FALEIRO. 
The author of ''Beautiful Thing: Inside the Secret World of Bombay's Dance Bars.''

 BODY:
MEENA DEVI is only 10 years old, but she's the head of her household. She cooks, cleans and takes care of her 11-year-old brother, Sunil, while a 14-year-old brother, Anil, works at a faraway brick kiln in a neighboring state. The three have been orphans since their mother died of starvation three years ago. They have an aunt in their village, but the most she's ever done is send over food to their mud hut.
In June, I wrote an article that appeared in The International Herald Tribune, documenting this family's daily life in the impoverished eastern state of Bihar. E-mails started to pour in the next morning. One was from a record producer in Los Angeles. He grew up in modest circumstances, and told me that he saw himself in Meena. He offered to pay all three children's education and living expenses until they turned 18, an amount equal to $1,200 per year.
It was an opportunity of a lifetime. Why, then, did the children's relatives refuse to let them take it? 
Unlike the other scruffy village children, Meena made an effort to stay presentable. She was soft-spoken and polite; she slicked down her bob with spit and kept her face clean. Perhaps this adult inclination was a natural extension of her adult responsibilities.
I'd been introduced to Meena by Mokhtarul Haque, an activist with India's Save the Childhood Movement, known by its Hindi abbreviation B.B.A. The B.B.A. has rescued and rehabilitated trafficked children for over 25 years. Mr. Haque had met with Meena's only surviving relative, her aunt Savitri Devi Manjhi, soon after Meena's mother died in 2009, and Mrs. Manjhi had then urged Mr. Haque to place the children in a government foster home. In June, following the record producer's proposal, Mr. Haque offered the children spots in a B.B.A. school.
The B.B.A., like other nonprofit groups, built its own schools partly in response to the sorry state of government foster homes, where corporal punishment is routine and abuse is common. I've met many children who attempted to run away, preferring to take their chances on the street.
But after initially accepting Mr. Haque's offer, the Manjhis quickly changed their minds, insisting they were capable of looking after the children.
Never mind that Meena and Sunil were perpetually hungry and slept without even a piece of cloth to separate their bodies from the hut's dirt floor. Or that the Manjhis trafficked him at age 11 into a dangerous brick kiln soon after his mother died. (In India, children under 14 are permitted to work, but not in hazardous environments. An amendment to India's child labor laws, proposed in August, would ban children under 14 from working anywhere.)
The Manjhis are the product of intergenerational poverty and caste-based marginalization. Like their parents, they're poor, illiterate and seasonally employed. They don't think beyond their daily survival. They're also aware that no matter how bad life gets for them, public assistance is unlikely, and change is an impossible dream. They know they have no one to depend on but themselves and their younger kin. They may have empathy for their niece and nephews, but they can't afford to act on it.
IN a society with few effective regulatory institutions, there's neither an incentive to take responsibility nor repercussions for not doing so. People don't do the right thing because it's easy not to, and there's no reward for doing it. Villagers are preoccupied with their own daily survival. And it's easier for bureaucrats to do nothing.
A lack of accountability not only kills motivation, it encourages outright malfeasance. In India's poorest districts, easily bribed police officers enable trafficking. India, according to Unicef, now has more child laborers under 14 than any other country.
What's most galling about this corrupt behavior is the fact that the current government is making an unprecedented effort to confront poverty. In 2011, according to a World Bank report, India spent over 2 percent of its gross domestic product on poverty alleviation. Over the past 11 years, India's government has sought to provide free midday school meals, a guarantee of 100 days of employment annually to the rural poor and free primary education. But endemic corruption, from the very top down to the ground level, prevents them from being implemented effectively. A lack of transparency and a leakage of subsidies to the nonpoor means that poverty isn't falling nearly as fast as it should be.
The free hot meal is the reason Meena goes to school. But her teachers routinely skip school, three days a week. When teachers don't come, the school stays shut, and there's no meal. A well-funded, well-intentioned program created to educate and feed poor children fails on both counts: Meena not only learns nothing, she also goes hungry.
But it's the Manjhis' choices that have had the greatest impact on Meena. And these, too, were influenced by government failings. The low-caste residents of Meena's village work the land of their upper-caste neighbors, who pay them in grain. To earn cash, entire families find supplemental work in one of the state's many brick kilns, but they don't earn enough to feed themselves adequately.
The government's Public Distribution System, which offers subsidized food and fuel, should cover them. But in 2011 less than 10 percent of the grain intended for Bihar's poor actually reached them. The rest was sold on the black market, bought by wealthier people with fake food ration cards or, worst of all, sold at a markup to the very people meant to receive discounted grain.
Government inefficiency has left the Manjhis poor and hungry, so they have taken control of 14-year-old Anil's earnings. His salary of less than a $1 a day is paltry even by Indian standards. But for the Manjhis, it was still too much to risk losing. And so they refused to let Anil and his siblings leave for school. Unless their economic lot improves, the Manjhis will keep sending him to work at the brick kiln. Sunil will most likely soon join him.
A worse fate awaits Meena. Traffickers masquerading as eligible grooms routinely trick poor families into parting with their daughters, often before puberty. The families succumb because there's no demand for dowry or wedding expenses. New brides are whisked away and sold into bonded labor or to brothels, where they're raped into submission. They almost never return home.
THERE are thousands of Meenas in Bihar and millions of Meenas in India. Individuals, nonprofits and charities can't be expected to step in to save them all from tragedy.
India's deafening aspirations to global power will never be realized if the potential of these millions of children continues to be squandered.
The government must move beyond merely developing ambitious policies -- it must also ensure that these policies aren't corrupted. There must be stern reprisals for graft and dereliction of duty. And it must be worthwhile for poor people to do the right thing; they should be rewarded for good behavior. Prosecution of child-labor traffickers and their henchmen must be accelerated. And India needs to overhaul its system of state-run foster homes so that children don't avoid them out of fear.
Only if real change occurs at the top will those at the bottom accept a stake in their community's future. As long as Mrs. Manjhi is hungry, she'll do everything in her power to stay alive -- including sending her younger relatives to work. But if she were to receive real support from the government, that wasn't funneled away by corrupt middlemen, she would not need to send Anil to work, and she would be likely to resist the temptation to earn extra cash illegally, for fear of losing state benefits.
Meena and her brothers now have a firm offer to live at a good school. This should be their happy ending. But it isn't. If a child who has so many people fighting on her behalf can't be assured justice, the millions of other children with no such allies have little hope.
The good will of 1,000 record producers in Los Angeles won't change that. Only the Indian government can.

HEADLINE: A Label That Has Regained Its Luster

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
REMEMBER the Chrysler K-car? Dave Schiff, a founder of Made Collection, a new flash-sale site that sells only American-made goods, hopes not.
When he was coming of age in the early '80s, the phrase ''Buy American'' was epitomized by Chrysler's boxy, style-challenged sedan, marketed as a star-spangled rebuke to the sleek imports of the day. In Mr. Schiff's view, you bought one to satisfy a patriotic duty, not a sense of style. '' 'Made in the U.S.A.' came with baggage,'' he said.
Times have changed. Even as the ''Made in the U.S.A.'' label has grown scarce, thanks to the offshore manufacturing in apparel and other industries, it has acquired cachet as a signifier of old-school craftsmanship, even luxury.
The movement has come far enough that Mr. Schiff, a former advertising executive from Miami, believed the time was right to start a Gilt-like shopping site for the Americana set, selling items like shuttle-loom jeans, lace baby dolls and a 19th-century-style baseball made of leather sourced from a Chicago tannery. 
''The old 'Buy American' is get something lousy and pay more,'' said Mr. Schiff, 45. Now ''it's a premium product.''
Style bloggers were among the early adopters. '' 'Made in U.S.A.' has gone through a rebranding of sorts,'' said Michael Williams, whose popular men's style blog, A Continuous Lean, has become an online clubhouse for devotees of American-made heritage labels like Red Wing Shoes and Filson.
But the embrace of domestic goods has also moved beyond scruffy D.J. types in Brooklyn who plunk down $275 for a pair of hand-sewn dungarees sewn from Cone denim from the company's White Oak plant in North Carolina. The adherents now include ''urban creatives, high-net-worth individuals, locavores, liberals, conservatives,'' said Mr. Williams, who also represents some of these heritage brands as a marketing consultant.
In other words, Americana chic has gone mainstream. Just visit the nearest mall. Club Monaco unveiled a Made in the USA collection last year, in collaboration with Mr. Williams. J. Crew cashes in on Americana chic by selling domestically manufactured Alden shoes, Levi's Vintage Clothing jeans and Billykirk leather goods. Joseph Abboud's home page trumpets its collections as ''Made in the New America.''
The newfound pride also extends to American cities and smaller communities. Made in Brooklyn is a phenomenon so self-aware, there are stores like By Brooklyn that specialize in products made in the borough. Similarly, an old shoe-polish brand called Shinola has recently been revived to make upscale watches, bicycles and other crafted goods in Detroit and is being promoted as ''Made in Detroit.''
And in a survey last year of 1,300 affluent shoppers by Unity Marketing, a Pennsylvania-based consulting and marketing group, respondents ranked the United States first (higher than Italy or France) in perceived manufacturing quality of luxury goods.
Indeed, the ''Made in the U.S.A.'' label has become chic in the eyes of well-heeled consumers not just in the United States, but also in Asia, said Paulette Garafalo, the president for international, wholesale and manufacturing at Brooks Brothers, which has increased production of shirts, suits and neckwear at its three American factories to meet growing demand. ''People want the credibility of an American brand,'' she said.
The flight of American factory jobs has even become a heated issue in the presidential race, with President Obama and Mitt Romney trading jabs over being the ''Outsourcer in Chief,'' to use Mr. Romney's phrase.
But while American-made goods are now fashionable, few have been willing to stake their professional future on it quite like Mr. Schiff. A former advertising executive at Crispin Porter + Bogusky in Miami, who oversaw the introduction of Coke Zero, he left the firm in April to start Made with two other veterans from the agency, Scott Prindle and John Kieselhorst.
In a sense, they started two companies, which are based in Boulder, Colo.: Made Collection, the flash-sale site, and Made Movement, an advertising agency that represents companies that manufacture only in America. (''If Apple came to us, we'd have to turn them down,'' Mr. Schiff said.)
Unlike the typical Buy American sites, which feature crude graphics and a low-budget hodgepodge of pliers and rain boots, Made Collection has the slick yet earthy look of a Madewell campaign. Edie Ure, a former designer for Ralph Lauren and Anthropologie, serves as the site's curator, and she gives special consideration to design-forward wares that would not be out of place in a Monocle magazine gift guide.
Recent flash-sale items included a knot-back black swimsuit from Cala Ossidiana, a swimwear company based in New York. It sells for $295 and, according to a graphic accompanying each item, supports six American workers. For those with humbler tastes, there was an O.C.E. Hickory work shirt, produced by inmates in the Oregon correctional system as part of its job-training program, for $26.99.
The company grew out of Mr. Schiff's conviction that a manufacturing revival was crucial to a lasting economic recovery.
Made now counts 26 employees, and with a minimum of publicity, its site has 10,000 members. The ad agency has signed seven clients, including Emeco chairs, a Pennsylvania-based design company whose product sells at Design Within Reach, and New Belgium Brewing, based in Fort Collins, Colo., which brews Fat Tire ale.
Mr. Schiff practices what he preaches. For a recent lunch at the Ace Hotel in Manhattan, he wore Levi's premium shuttle-loom 501s made in Los Angeles. His tattooed arms poked out of a blue checked shirt by the boutique design house 8.15 August Fifteenth, made in New York City, which he spruced up with a seersucker bow tie by Gitman Bros., made in North Carolina. The only smudge on the stars-and-stripes tableau was his pair of Vans sneakers made in China.
''I would say most days, I'm at about 75 percent,'' he said, referring to how much of his outfit is American made. He never wants to become a fanatic, however. ''If you become obsessive about it,'' he added, ''it's an imposition versus a choice.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Brilliant Intern To Thread Needles, Free

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
In February, Xuedan Wang, a 2010 graduate of Ohio University, received modest attention after she filed a lawsuit against the Hearst Corporation claiming that the company violated labor laws when it did not pay her for the work she had done as an intern at Harper's Bazaar, one of its magazines, over four months last year. Speaking to New York magazine last week, on the occasion of Fashion Week, Ms. Wang, who goes by Diana, explained that she had spent more than half of her life dreaming of Bazaar and approximately 12 months working at a pharmaceutical company in Columbus in order to save enough money to realize her Manhattan vision.
Then she found herself spending as much as 55 hours a week at a job she likened to ''working in shipping and receiving.'' At the end of it all, she couldn't secure a paying job. For someone with her particular aspirations, only the HVAC industry could have contained greater indignities. 
Internships are a problem, as Ross Perlin wrote in his 2011 book, ''Intern Nation,'' and others have effectively argued, not only because they impede efforts to reduce unemployment, but also because they assist in perpetuating inequality, privileging the already-fortunate who can afford work without pay.
The alienation is heightened in the linked worlds of New York news media and fashion, where even affluence can be insufficient in the absence of good lineage. Any 22-year-old seeking an internship at Ralph Lauren or Cond Nast, for instance, would benefit from being able to say that she received her first instructions in skirt length and seating arrangement from her godmother Lauren Bacall and her uncle Tom Wolfe.
Fashion internships proliferate in New York for the simple reason that lots of people want to toil in fashion. Although reality television has made it a populist preoccupation, fashion is a reflexively elitist and needlessly self-serious field that, like others, has professionalized itself to the exclusion of incorporating a broader work force. (As anyone who has watched pseudo-improvised MTV series like ''The Hills'' or ''The City'' can say, you'd seem to need no more than a high school equivalency diploma and a neurotic sense of urgency about all things to succeed in fashion publicity.)
Begun five years ago, the Web site Free Fashion Internships lists hundreds of positions in the city, some asking far more of applicants than the jobs themselves would seem to require. A posting for an unpaid position in public relations at Eugenia Kim, a well-known milliner, for example, demands that prospects not only be ''enterprising,'' but also be ''brilliant.'' Speaking to the mythical candidate who is presumably forfeiting a Marshall scholarship to cold-call accessories editors at InStyle, the posting explains that ''if you have 'down time' you are looking up recent celebrity images to see if any celebs have been spotted wearing the brand.''
Another listing announces an unpaid marketing and social-media position at something called Zomina Photography in Queens. It stipulates that applicants, on top of their weekday commitment, must be flexible on Saturdays and Sundays and present themselves as ''fashionable, trendy, edgy and chic''; and in all-capital letters it admonishes anyone who isn't against applying.
Plenty of jobless people who haven't gone to Vassar are capable of returning shoes to their designers after fashion shoots. But enlisting the edgy and chic to do the job free deprives an entire class of people from whole categories of entry-level work. Beyond that, the belief that performing these chores for no fee provides entree to a more meaningful career is challenged by a survey conducted last year by the National Association of Colleges and Employers that indicated that graduates who had paid internships were more likely to receive job offers than those who took unpaid work.
While it's arguably the case that you ought to be well-groomed to work in the image business -- as you ought to have Dr. Seuss books in the waiting room if you're a pediatrician -- it is much less clear that you need to be in college. Higher education provides many employers with the loophole through which they can staff their offices with uncompensated assistants. The Fair Labor Standards Act requires that employers pay everyone, but exemptions exist for purely educational positions that are exclusively for the benefit of the intern (few internships, of course, would seem to meet that standard). Like Hearst and the design firm Eugenia Kim, many employers offer college credit in lieu of a salary for performing tasks that often seem menial and exploitive to those who do them. To Ms. Wang's complaints, Hearst has countered that she misrepresented herself as a student and that all sorts of young people ''have studied'' in dozens of different internships at the company.
Our reliance on unpaid interns has become so pervasive that even retail outlets now deploy them. Anthropologie, purveyor of faux haute-bohemian clothes and housewares, uses interns to help produce its visual displays, again in exchange for college credit. This past week, the Chelsea branch was seeking candidates to assist in creating its holiday windows. One young woman who was applying was a senior at the Fashion Institute of Technology and had held a paid job at a boutique in Brooklyn and the Hamptons. She had been writing a blog and photographing merchandise, but when she left, her job was turned into an unpaid position. Her competition at Anthropologie was someone with a master's degree in architecture.
In the old New York of the mid-20th-century, hunger, talent and eccentricity were often enough to ferry a career. Decades ago, Roy Halston Fenwick arrived in New York by way of Iowa (where he was voted prettiest baby at the state fair) and an abandoned education to dominate American fashion in the '70s. Today, we have Zac Posen, who came to us by way of SoHo and private schooling, with a mother in corporate finance. With the Vogue editor Anna Wintour serving as one of President Obama's biggest fund-raisers, fashion's liberal credibility goes unquestioned -- should it?

HEADLINE: In the Bowels of the City, Blocking Wastewater Overflows

BYLINE: By KATE ASCHER. 
Kate Ascher is a former executive vice president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation and author of ''The Works: Anatomy of a City,'' among other books. She is on the faculty at Columbia University.

 BODY:
It happens dozens of times a year, undermining water quality, closing beaches and endangering aquatic life: Hit by major rainfall, New York's sewers release raw sewage and polluted storm water into New York Harbor. These ''overflow events'' account for an estimated 27 billion gallons of pollutants annually in the city's waters.
They are an artifact of the development of New York's combined sewer system in the 19th century, which integrated smaller mains for wastewater from buildings with larger pipes and sewers for storm water. That was a major advance from the cesspools and gutters that carried waste to whatever canal or waterway was closest -- though for decades the city dumped unprocessed sewage directly into harbor waters. 
In the first half of the 20th century, sewage-treatment plants were designed and built. But while the dense network of pipes that feeds the plants works fine in dry weather, during storms, the volume of wastewater flowing through the pipes is more than the plants can process. To avoid wastewater backing up into homes or streets, combined sewer overflow outlets allow untreated water to bypass the plants and flow directly into the waterways.
New York is hardly alone in its problems: hundreds of older municipalities that constructed combined systems are confronted with the same water-quality issues during major rainstorms. Since the cost of replacing these systems with newer networks that segregate waste and storm water is prohibitive, cities have found other solutions.
Some have built retention basins -- tanks that hold sewage until the water volume has eased. Others have reconfigured treatment facilities to expand and maximize flow rate. Still others, including New York, have embraced ''green infrastructure'' -- green roofs, porous pavements and so-called bioswales, or planted ditches that filter contaminants -- to reduce the amount, speed and toxicity of water drainage after a storm.
But perhaps the most unusual of technologies to avoid overflows are the inflatable dams that have recently been installed by the city's Environmental Protection Department at two locations in Brooklyn: Williamsburg and Red Hook. These dams, large cylindrical rubber structures attached to a concrete base and placed within sewer mains, are controlled by sensors and inflate during heavy rain. Once inflated, they block the flow of rain water and sewage and turn the sewer mains into a wastewater storage site; if the water gets too high, threatening to back up into homes or streets, sensors deflate the dam to release some water.
At a cost of $15.7 million for two, each dam can retain roughly two million gallons of water -- until the rain has eased and the dam deflates to allow water to flow to a treatment plant. Together, they are expected to save about 100 million gallons of sewage each year from flowing untreated into the harbor.
GRAPHICS: Inflatable Dams: To help prevent the dumping of raw sewage into New York's waterways during a storm, the city has installed inflatable dams in two locations. These allow waste and storm water to be stored temporarily in existing sewers, avoiding the need for new -- and expensive-- holding tanks. Unlike newer sewer systems, New York's uses a ''combined system'' in which most of the sewers mix raw sewage and storm-water runoff in the same pipe.; Inflation and Deflation: Sensors monitor the water level in the upstream sewer and the regulator chamber, inflating and deflating the dam at specific heights to prevent sewage from overflowing into the water body at the regulator.

HEADLINE: Argentines Turn Cash Into Condos In Miami

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Charles Newbery contributed reporting from Buenos Aires.

 BODY:
MIAMI
IN early August, Jorge Sanchez, a broker with Douglas Elliman, flew to Buenos Aires to sell some Miami real estate. He returned to Florida a few days later with four signed contracts from Argentines for apartments in a 60-story tower in downtown Miami.
The fact that the buyers signed the contracts without ever flying to Miami to see the building -- Opera Tower -- speaks volumes about how eager, and desperate, Argentines have been to direct their money out of their country and into real estate in Miami and New York.
In the past few months, Argentines have quietly passed Brazilians to become the most active group from Latin America buying Miami real estate, according to Millie Sanchez, executive vice president of development marketing for Douglas Elliman Florida.
Brazil's demotion from the top spot likely has something to do with the weakening of its currency, the real, versus the dollar in recent months. But in Argentina, a weakening peso and 25 percent inflation, economists say, have spurred many affluent Argentines to move their money into American real estate by expensive and sometimes illegal means. 
Economic and political uncertainty around the globe are benefitting real estate in the United States, especially in Miami and New York, the two ''safe haven'' American cities foreign investors usually look to first. South Florida's real estate market is certainly no stranger to capital flight from Latin America. But the velocity at which some Argentines are investing in Miami real estate has shocked some brokers here.
''The desperation of the Argentine people has taken over and they are actually market leaders here now,'' Ms. Sanchez said. ''Any project today in Miami is probably being sold 50 percent to the Argentines.''
The government of Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner, Argentina's president, has been trying to stop the capital outflow, which nearly doubled to $21.5 billion last year from $11.4 billion in 2010, with increasingly severe methods.
Argentines now have to submit requests to tax authorities to convert pesos into dollars for overseas trips, and are rarely approved for much. Overseas credit card purchases are heavily taxed at home. And specially trained dogs working for tax authorities are sniffing for dollars at ports, airports and border crossings.
The government began restricting access to dollars last November, days after Ms. Kirchner won a second four-year term.
What's driving all this? Argentina has struggled to preserve its hard-currency reserves in the Central Bank and sustain a trade surplus. The country has had limited access to international credit markets, owing to its inability to win back the confidence of global investors after its $100 billion default in 2001.
The government has refused to take on more debt, to rapidly devalue the peso, or to reduce spending, which it needs to sustain programs for the poor and working class that make up its voter base. Instead, Ms. Kirchner's government has chosen to clamp down on capital flight by whatever means possible.
Banks in Argentina are lending at rates some 10 percent under the inflation rate, economists say. There are few profitable investments left in the country, said Eduardo Blasco, a financial consultant in Buenos Aires.
Argentines are buying foreign properties not only to park their savings but also to make extra income through rentals. ''Argentines don't want any more Argentine risk,'' Mr. Blasco said.
So they are willing to risk their savings on Miami real estate instead. At Opera Tower, at 1750 North Bayshore Drive, half of the 30 apartments sold in the past month were bought by Argentines, Ms. Sanchez said. Most were all-cash purchases, even though the developer, Florida East Coast Realty, has offered to finance up to 65 percent of the purchases.
After selling about a third of the building's 635 apartments before 2008, the developer turned the building into rentals after the housing crisis. Six months ago, Opera Tower began selling condos again. Since then some 90 apartments of the remaining 394 have gone into contract, said Luis Espinosa, the director of marketing for Florida East Coast Realty.
The building has become almost a pure investment play. Owners are occupying less than 5 percent of the apartments, which are selling for $250,000 to $650,000 for studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms, said Ana Tajes, Opera Tower's sales director.
Opera Tower is popular with Argentines because the developer is offering to lease back the apartments from the buyers, pay their monthly maintenance charges and give them an annual net rent equal to 6 percent of the purchase price for three years.
Argentines have also been scooping up apartments in Manhattan. Maria Velazquez, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, met a group of Argentines in Miami earlier this month and accompanied them to New York. She said she has sold six apartments totaling $8 million to Argentines since last November, including four apartments at One Museum Mile, located at 1280 Fifth Avenue.
In December, Ms. Velazquez represented a group of Argentines that bid $10.35 million for eight apartments at 400 Fifth Avenue. They were later outbid, she said.
''They wanted to act fast and get their money out'' of Argentina, Ms. Velazquez said. ''Whoever buys in New York already has four or five apartments in Miami.''
While her Argentine sales have been strong, Ms. Velazquez lately has been selling even more in New York to another skittish group from Latin America: Venezuelans.
Concerns about the Oct. 7 election in Venezuela, in which the 13-year incumbent, President Hugo Chavez, faces perhaps his stiffest challenge from Henrique Capriles, have led to a new exodus of cash from the country that is finding its way into New York real estate.
In the past year Ms. Velazquez said she has sold $35 million worth of Manhattan real estate to Venezuelans, including nine apartments at the Aldyn (60 Riverside Boulevard), three of which were $7 million penthouses of about 3,096 square feet each.
In contrast to about four years ago, when many Venezuelans struggled to wire large sums of money out of the country because of government restrictions, this time around they are using funds from accounts in Switzerland and the Virgin Islands, she said.
Some Argentines are using money that was already waiting in American bank accounts. Others have been willing to pay a black-market premium of up to 40 percent to convert their money into dollars at home, and a commission of up to 7 percent to transfer funds abroad through a currency exchange house, an illegal transaction, economists said.
The dollar restrictions have caused Argentina's own real estate market, which has traditionally been transacted in dollars, to flatten, as Argentines sit on their properties, said Marina Dal Poggetto, an economist in Buenos Aires.
''Those that have properties don't want to sell in pesos, only in dollars,'' she said. ''But buyers don't have dollars.''
The government controls are having a profound effect. Capital flight from Argentina plunged 69 percent to $3.57 billion in the first half of 2012, from $11.7 billion in the second half of 2011.
Deserving part of the credit is Argentina's national tax agency, which has used a team of 50 specially trained dogs -- most of which are golden retrievers and Labradors -- to sniff out the dye in dollars and other foreign currencies.
The Kirchner government has boasted about the dogs' exploits.
In February, the government said, Tiza found $110,000 in a car crossing into Uruguay. In July, Isidoro and Bruno, two other dogs, found $20,000 in a car trying to cross the border with Paraguay. Then last month, Catalina, which appeared to be a black Labrador, found 187,000 reals ($92,493) in the airbag of a Toyota Hilux at a border crossing with Brazil.
The busts pass for black humor in Argentina these days. But a good chunk of the money that is managing to slip out by determined Argentines is finding its way into Florida and New York real estate, and for brokers here that is no laughing matter.

HEADLINE: In Prosecutors, Debt Collectors Find a Partner

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
The letters are sent by the thousands to people across the country who have written bad checks, threatening them with jail if they do not pay up.
They bear the seal and signature of the local district attorney's office. But there is a catch: the letters are from debt-collection companies, which the prosecutors allow to use their letterhead. In return, the companies try to collect not only the unpaid check, but also high fees from debtors for a class on budgeting and financial responsibility, some of which goes back to the district attorneys' offices.
The practice, which has spread to more than 300 district attorneys' offices in recent years, shocked Angela Yartz when she was threatened with conviction over a $47.95 check to Walmart. A single mother in San Mateo, Calif., Ms. Yartz said she learned the check had bounced only when she opened a letter in February, signed by the Alameda County district attorney, informing her that unless she paid $280.05 -- including $180 for a ''financial accountability'' class -- she could be jailed for up to one year.
''I was so worried driving my kid to and from school that if I failed to signal, they would cart me off to jail,'' Ms. Yartz said. 
Debt collectors have come under fire for illegally menacing people behind on their bills with threats of jail. What makes this approach unusual is that the ultimatum comes with the imprimatur of law enforcement itself -- though it is made before any prosecutor has determined a crime has been committed.
Prosecutors say that the partnerships allow them to focus on more serious crimes, and that the letters are sent only to check writers who ignore merchants' demands for payment. The district attorneys receive a payment from the firms or a small part of the fees collected.
''The companies are returning thousands of dollars to merchants that is not coming at taxpayer expense,'' said Ken Ryken, deputy district attorney with Alameda County.
Consumer lawyers have challenged the debt collectors in courts across the United States, claiming that they lack the authority to threaten prosecution or to ask for fees for classes when no district attorney has reviewed the facts of the cases. The district attorneys are essentially renting out their stationery, the lawyers say, allowing the companies to give the impression that failure to respond could lead to charges, when it rarely does.
''This is guilty until proven innocent,'' said Paul Arons, a consumer lawyer in Friday Harbor, Wash., about two hours north of Seattle.
The partnerships have proliferated from Los Angeles to Baltimore to Detroit, according to the National District Attorneys Association, as the stagnant economy leaves city and state officials grappling with budget shortfalls. Lawyers for the check writers estimate that more than 1 million of them are targeted a year. The two main debt collectors -- California-based CorrectiveSolutions and BounceBack of Missouri -- return millions of dollars each year to retailers including Safeway, Target and Walmart.
While the number of bounced checks has fallen as more shoppers pay with credit or debit cards, Americans still write billions of dollars worth of bad checks each year. In 2009, $127 billion worth of checks were returned, according to the most recent data from the Federal Reserve. That's down from $182 billion in 2006.
Because the cases are not fully investigated, there is no way of knowing whether the bad checks were the result of innocent mistakes or intentional fraud. The so-called bad check diversion programs start from the position that a crime has been committed.
Before the first partnerships were rolled out in the late 1980s, merchants who received a bad check typically tried to retrieve the money themselves or through a private collection company, with abysmal results. Those merchants who suspected fraud could send along the checks to their local district attorneys.
The influx of bad-check reports overwhelmed district attorneys' offices, according to Grover C. Trask, a former district attorney in Riverside, Calif., considered the father of such programs. ''It was a way to deal with a fairly serious nonviolent crime going on in the business community, but not overburden the court system or the resources of the district attorneys,'' Mr. Trask said.
The programs were quickly challenged by consumer lawyers, who took aim primarily at California-based American Corrective Counseling Services. Facing a barrage of class-action lawsuits, the company reorganized through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009.
Still, its successor, CorrectiveSolutions, which says it has contracts with more than 140 prosecutors, has been dogged by similar legal challenges, including a class-action lawsuit pending in federal court in San Francisco that claims the company ''has constructed an elaborate artifice'' to terrify borrowers into paying. CorrectiveSolutions, which did not respond to requests for comment, has contested the claims, court filings show.
For the collection companies, the partnerships offer a distinct financial benefit: the ''financial accountability'' classes. Typically, a small portion of the class fees, which can exceed $150, are passed on to the district attorneys' offices. Check writers are led to believe that unless they take the courses, they could end up in jail.
A letter signed by the Santa Clara County district attorney, for example, informed Kathy Pepper that the ''bad check restitution program'' would allow her to avoid ''the possibility of further action against the accused by the District Attorney's Office.''
Petrified, Ms. Pepper agreed to pay $170 for a class and another $25 to reschedule the class last year after accidentally writing a $68 check in the midst of a divorce last year that upended her finances.
What Ms. Pepper did not know was that her bad check was sent directly from the merchant to the debt-collection company, without any prosecutor determining whether she had actually committed a crime.
Under the terms of five contracts between CorrectiveSolutions and district attorneys reviewed by The New York Times, merchants refer checks directly to the company, circumventing the prosecutors' offices. While the merchants are required, for example, to attempt to contact the check writer, they can send any bad checks to the collection companies if the shopper hasn't responded, typically within 10 days.
''No one at the district attorney's office reviews the cases'' before the collection company sends out letters, said Priscilla Cruz, an assistant director in the Los Angeles district attorney's office.
As of July, CorrectiveSolutions had sent out 16,955 letters on behalf of the Los Angeles district attorney, and during that time 635 people attended the program's classes, county data show. While few people will be prosecuted for not attending the class, there is a possibility of charges, Ms. Cruz said.
While the percentage of targeted check writers taking the classes is low -- 4 percent to 7 percent in recent years -- the percentage of cases referred for potential prosecution is much lower, about 0.10 percent.
Few bad-check writers are prosecuted, especially for relatively small sums, lawyers say, because it is hard to prove the person meant to defraud the merchant.
Gale Krieg, a vice president at BounceBack, said he has turned down business from prosecutors who won't agree to at least have all copies of the checks sent to their offices, where prosecutors can determine if a crime has been committed. Mr. Krieg, who said the company has contracts in 38 states, acknowledges the limitations: ''Whether they exert oversight isn't something that we can control.''
Prosecutors point out that people who write bad checks should be held accountable for paying back what they owe.
''I view it as quite a win-win,'' said Baltimore County State's Attorney Scott D. Shellenberger. ''You aren't criminalizing someone who shouldn't have a criminal record, and you are getting the merchant his money back.'' On its Web site, CorrectiveSolutions says that its classes result in low rates of recidivism.
Some officials in district attorneys' offices have quietly raised concerns that the programs are misleading. A November 2009 county audit of Deschutes County, Ore., titled ''District Attorney's Office-Cash handling over revenues,'' wondered whether elements of the program could be ''disingenuous.'' The prosecutor's office, which did not return requests for comment, contracts with CorrectiveSolutions to handle its bad checks. Ms. Yartz said she accidentally wrote a check for groceries on her credit union account, rather than her bank checkbook. She had recently moved and was in the process of closing that account.
Even after Ms. Yartz paid $100.05 in February to cover the bounced check, the returned item fee and an administration fee, she got a letter signed by the Alameda district attorney informing her that her remaining balance was $180 for the class. After consulting with a lawyer, she decided to take her chances rather than pay for a class she could not afford, to avoid being punished for a crime she said she did not commit. Ms. Yartz also questioned the need for a class on budgeting and financial accountability: ''If I meant to bounce this check like a criminal, why do I need a class on budgeting?''

HEADLINE: With the Crowds Gone, It's Down to Serious Fishing

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
EDGARTOWN, Mass. -- Striped bass are nocturnal, and every year at this time, Kathi Pogoda becomes nocturnal too.
She rises at 1 a.m. and is in ''her'' corner of Memorial Wharf in this old whaling town by 3 a.m. She ties her lines by the glow of a miner's light strapped to her forehead, and then casts a shiny lure over her shoulder and out in a long arc that unfurls with a clean whoosh into the dark waters of Edgartown Harbor.
Ms. Pogoda, 68, is a property manager in her normal life here on Martha's Vineyard. But after Labor Day, when the summer people retreat and the nights turn nippy, the island morphs from a playground for the rich and famous into the staging ground for one of the great saltwater fishing tournaments in the Northeast.
The Striped Bass and Bluefish Derby, as the tournament is called, is no ordinary contest. It lasts five full weeks, enough time for participants to lose themselves completely in a compulsive competition that turns their lives upside down. At the same time, it knits the local community of 15,000 full-time residents back together after they lived among a population that swelled to 105,000 at the height of the summer. 
September is when islanders begin to reclaim the island, and when older generations engage younger generations with the rituals of fishing and the traditions of the derby, now in its 67th year.
The derby started at 12:01 a.m. on Sept. 9, and about 1,200 people have registered so far. By the end, 3,000 are expected to join the hunt. They compete according to type of fish, whether it was caught on shore or by boat, and by the age of the angler. With multiple contests within contests, more than 100 prizes are awarded every day, including coveted fishing pins; the grand prizes are a 22-foot fishing boat and a Chevy pickup.
The hub of derby activity is a small wooden shack here where fishermen and fisherwomen from across the island lug in their catch in coolers at 8 in the morning and 8 at night. They slap down the fish on a wooden measuring table, and the weigh master lays it on the scales. All eyes fixate on the overhead digital monitor to see the official weight, though many of the old salts standing around have already guessed it.
This is also where the anglers size up one another.
Annie Finnerty, 22, had that experience the other night when she and her father, Charlie, who operates a charter boat and sells real estate, brought in their striped bass. Ms. Finnerty had won in the junior division when she was in the eighth grade (and did her homework on her father's boat), but she had not fished the derby since going to college.
''Tonight I was talking to some of the older gals who are always leading the women's division, and they were looking at me like, 'O.K.,' '' she said, as if they were saying, ''You're now our competition.'' With her 14.98-pound striper, Ms. Finnerty placed third on the leader board; her father, with a 17.1-pounder, placed second.
In first place was John Casey, who brought in a 28.23-pound striper. He and Mr. Finnerty were a good illustration of the equalizing nature of fishing.
Mr. Finnerty -- whose full name, Charles Russell Lowell Putnam Finnerty, reflects an old Yankee pedigree -- once did painting restoration for the Italian government and lives in a house on the Vineyard that has been in his family for five generations. Mr. Casey is an unemployed pressman from Rhode Island who sleeps on an air mattress in a shed by his brother's house while seeking odd jobs as a day laborer.
The derby is full of such contrasts, but the fish make no distinction. Except, perhaps, by falling victim more often to locals whose families have been fishing here for decades, if not centuries, and who feel the tides in their bones.
''There's young Kadison, young Taylor, they're third generation,'' Roy Langley, 84, the morning weigh master, said as he scanned the board. ''Amaral. Maciel. Bettencourt. They get it in their blood.''
Competition is also in the blood. No one ever reveals where they catch their fish. If someone asks, the only answer is ''In the mouth.''
But location, location, location is as important in fishing as it is in real estate. The charter boat captains know the hot spots, which is how they can command $1,200 a day and why others will track them with binoculars.
''We're alone in the middle of the ocean and we're catching a lot of fish, and suddenly out of nowhere four boats appear,'' said Ed Jerome, 65, the longtime president of the derby and a charter boat captain.
''They see you going out at night,'' Mr. Jerome added, ''and they look on your roof rack and they say, 'Does he have bottom-fishing gear or is he plugging? What's he doing? Is he throwing live eels?' '' He said he and his buddies switch their gear to throw onlookers off the scent.
With the competition so intense, much of the workaday world slides by the wayside. There is no point in calling a plumber or an electrician -- most will have gone fishing.
Eric Brown, 44, a chef at Farm Neck Caf who fishes with Ms. Pogoda, announced one morning on the wharf that he would be going to work soon, ''unless the fishing's really good, in which case they can wait for me.'' Upon further reflection, he added: ''They could fire me, I don't care. This is much more important.''
While a majority of derby entrants live here, many come from off the island. Mr. Jerome said the derby brought in millions of dollars each year in spending on fuel, bait, tackle and other gear, food, lodging and charter boats.
Keith Stevens, 57, a truck driver from Lawrenceville, N.J., who stopped by Larry's Tackle Shop the other day, has been fishing the derby for years. With his wife and in-laws in tow, he rents a house for $3,800 for two weeks.
''I'd rather spend my money gambling on fishing than on Atlantic City,'' Mr. Stevens said. ''I told my little brother, 'When I die, you cremate me and take me over to Menemsha to my favorite spot and put me in the water.'' Like a true competitor, he did not reveal the location of that spot.
Chances are, Quinn Keefe, 11, knows where it is. He has been fishing since he was 2 and is a regular on the Menemsha jetty.
He had a thrilling derby last year. In the last hour of the tournament, he reeled in a false albacore. He ran down the jetty with his catch, passing older fisherman who dropped their rods to applaud him. Quinn jumped in the car with his family and raced to the weigh station, more than 30 minutes away. He slapped his albacore up on the measuring table, and it weighed in at 7.66 pounds -- earning him third place in the junior division as well as a pin, a rod and a tackle box.
He was back in the derby this year. Even as the winds whipped around him on the jetty and the waves smashed against the rocks, Quinn was an island of calm. He was pulling up seaweed, but he simply picked it off his line and cast again.
''You have to be patient,'' he said as the sun sank into the water and his mother fretted on shore about getting him home for dinner. ''I just love sitting here,'' he said, beaming. ''It makes me happy.''

HEADLINE: For a Brazilian Vacation, 7 Rules to Save By

BYLINE: By SETH KUGEL

 BODY:
Brazil is too expensive for budget travelers. Or is it?
Evidence in the affirmative is strong. Rio de Janeiro and So Paulo are now the most expensive cities in the Western Hemisphere, by some measures. The dollar that used to get you 3 or almost 4 Brazilian reais at various points in the last decade now gets you just 2. Flying to Brazil from New York takes at least nine hours and can easily run $1,000.
But there is no need to be intimidated.
By following just a few guidelines, a trip to this country of astonishing cultural, geographical, economic, ecological, musical and culinary diversity might just be affordable. Or at least more affordable than you think. 
Here are the Frugal Traveler's Seven Rules for making every dollar (or every real, for that matter) count.
1. 'CONSOLIDATE' A LOWER FARE
It's just plain dumb to book a flight to Brazil through big online travel companies or the airlines' sites. Yes, dumb - as in feeding-cash-to-a-paper-shredder dumb. Instead, to find much lower fares, check with consolidators (agencies that negotiate with airlines for special rates) that specialize in Brazil. I generally call BACC Travel (800-222-2746), but this time, for variety's sake, I tested a competitor, AirProjects.com. Searching online for a 10-day trip from New York to Rio de Janeiro four weeks out, I found a $923 (taxes and fees included) nonstop fare on the Brazilian carrier TAM. Repeating the search on Kayak and Expedia, the best prices were $998 with a layover or $1,109 for nonstop.
Also, for travel within Brazil, don't be tricked by the international travel sites that show only one or two airlines operating domestic flights there. As in the United States, multiple airlines (which in Brazil include TAM, Avianca, Gol, Webjet and Azul) compete bitterly over domestic routes, often slashing prices below bus rates if you reserve well in advance. (Beware, though, that it can occasionally be tricky to reserve these online with an American credit card.)
2. CUT COSTS IN RIO ...
When most Americans imagine a trip to Brazil, they're thinking about Rio de Janeiro: Ipanema beach, the Christ the Redeemer statue, samba and caipirinha cocktails. That's a caricature, of course, but not a horribly inaccurate one. The city is painfully gorgeous, its residents famously festive and its offerings ever more culturally sophisticated. You shouldn't skip it.
But it is expensive, so here's one way to cut costs: Don't go during Carnival, New Year's or during other big events (say, the Confederations Cup soccer tournament in June), when hotel prices soar.
You can also save by staying outside the well-to-do neighborhoods of Ipanema and Leblon or the tourist epicenter of Copacabana. Consider neighborhoods like Glria, Flamengo and Botafogo. Avoid Barra da Tijuca (too far and too bland) and downtown (too dicey).
Apartment rentals can also be great deals, but think beyond Airbnb.com. Search online instead for "rio apartments" and you'll find a ton of local agencies. I use Vinicio Flats, but that's just habit; there are lots of good ones. Finally, the site camaecafe.com.br offers good deals for home-stay-like B&Bs in Santa Teresa, a gorgeous Bohemian neighborhood up in the hills above the center of the city. (Cama e Caf means "bed-and-breakfast.")
3. ... AND THEN LEAVE RIO
You can't stay in Rio the whole time, both because it's pricey and because you'll leave with a warped view of what Brazil is - much like a foreign visitor who comes to the United States and sees only Manhattan.
So how about a hop up to the Amazon, you say? Nope. Too far, too pricey, too complicated. Instead, I suggest traveling to Minas Gerais, one state north of Rio. Its waterfall-studded countryside is great to explore: its 17th- and 18th-century colonial mining towns are well preserved and romantic, and not expensive (the most well known are Ouro Preto, Diamantina and Tiradentes). The area's farm-fresh pork-and-stews-and-greens-and-sweets cuisine is what I consider the soul food of Brazil.
4. WEIGH WHAT YOU EAT
So Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are full of great restaurants; too bad many of them are absurdly overpriced. But even in those cities, and certainly in the rest of the country, there are tons of reasonably priced alternatives. Two genres of dining spots worth seeking are "self-service" buffets where you pay by weight, and diners sometimes called lanchonetes, where set meals are often under 10 reais. Juice stands (which also sell healthy sandwiches) abound in Rio.
5. PICK A POUSADA
Instead of booking hotels, look for pousadas, inns that often include breakfast and whose prices range from very reasonable (well under $100 a night) to stratospheric. Some pousadas come up on search sites like Hotels.com, but in general you need to do some digging.
How? Start with guidebooks (you know, the paper ones), which list lots of options. Then try a site called hiddenpousadasbrazil.com, a rare English-language pousada site nicely curated by an expatriate Englishwoman, Alison McGowan. Beyond that, simply Google "pousada" and the city or town you're looking for. (Then, if the site is only in Portuguese, run it through Google Translate.)
6. SPEAK (SOME OF) THE LANGUAGE
Brazilians are wonderful people who speak terrible English. That's a pithy generalization, but is broadly true. English speakers are most likely to be found at major hotels, touristy attractions and pricey restaurants, precisely the places a budget traveler must avoid. So get a phrase book and see if your local library offers its members free access to Mango online Portuguese lessons - New York's does. (Note: Your Spanish might help, but not as much as you think.)
7. DISAPPOINT MUGGERS
Rio, So Paulo and the other big cities are not nearly as dangerous as you might think from watching Brazilian movies like ... well, like just about all of them. Except for the rarest of exceptions, tourists don't get killed or kidnapped. But they do get mugged from time to time. So aside from not walking alone at night and taking other appropriate precautions, simply don't go out with anything you couldn't stand losing. I take a bit of cash, one credit card and a copy of my passport.
Coming Friday, more ways to save, with tips from a top Brazilian travel blogger, the editor of Brazil's best budget travel guide, and a Lonely Planet author who lives in So Paulo.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Who Wears The Pants In This Economy?

 BODY:
These men should be thankful that their wives didn't think their marriage was a one-way street, but a partnership, and rose to the challenge to help their families. You're the lucky ones; you have a partner whom you can rely on, even if you didn't expect to. Where would you be without her? What if she left you for a better ''provider''? Be thankful for what you have. 
NICOLE, Alabama, posted on nytimes.com
The men portrayed have lost a huge amount of their economic and social status. Unemployment, in particular, has been shown to be one of the worst things possible for mental health and happiness, on par with serious illness or death of a family member. Just because the men portrayed are white guys from a Republican part of the country doesn't mean people should be so indifferent to their suffering.
MATTHEW T. MITCHELL, Sacramento,posted on nytimes.com
For nearly 30 years, I worked as a mechanic in various heavy industries. About 10 years ago, I quit my job servicing locomotives on the Norfolk Southern Railway, got an undergraduate degree and a paralegal certificate and haven't been out of work for more than a month or two since. At least half the supervising attorneys I've worked for are women, and I've never given it a second's thought.The work I used to do and the men I worked with for much of my adult life were a whole lot more ''macho'' than any of the three men profiled in Hanna Rosin's piece. One of her subjects, who ran an industrial floor cleaning business, maintained that ''a man needs a strong ,macho job.'' All I can say is, good luck with that job search, buddy.
GLENN BALDWIN, Oakland, Calif.
Yes, manufacturing jobs are changing, and those used tobe part of men's ability to succeed as the economic providers for a family -- a role often chosen by men because of societal pressures or because they enjoyed having that be a part of their identity. But I don't think this is the alternative: ''As the usual path to the middle class disappears, what's emerging in its place is a nascent middle-class matriarchy, in which women like Patsy pay the mortgage and the cable bills while the men try to find their place.'' . . . Gender is not a zero-sum game. Mendo not need to be demasculinized every time a woman takes a step forward.

HEADLINE: The Road to Retirement

 BODY:
Even before the Great Recession, Americans were not saving enough, if anything, for retirement, and policy experts were warning of a looming catastrophe. The economic downturn and its consequences -- including losses in jobs, income, investments and home equity -- have made that bad situation much worse.
And yet, judging by the presidential campaign, this clear and present danger is a political nonissue. 
Medicare, of course, is an issue. But Social Security, a critical source of income for most retirees, is barely mentioned, though the parties have sharply different views on how to improve it. The Democratic platform correctly acknowledges that it can be strengthened and preserved, implying that a modest mix of tax increases and benefit cuts is needed. The Republican platform vows to ''give workers control over, and a sound return on, their investments.'' That sounds like privatization, which would be cruel folly.
Neither side, however, is grappling with the fact that the nation's retirement challenges go well beyond both programs, and that most Americans, by and large, cannot afford to retire.
The crux of the problem is that as traditional pensions have disappeared from the private sector, replacement plans have proved woefully inadequate. Fewer than half of the nation's private sector workers have 401(k) plans, and more than a third of households have no retirement coverage during their work lives, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.
The center also found that among people ages 55 to 64 who had a 401(k), the recession and slow recovery left the typical worker with just $54,000 in that account in 2010, while households with workers in that age group had $120,000 in all retirement accounts on average. That is not nearly enough.
Nor do most Americans have significant wealth in other assets to fall back on. According to Federal Reserve data, median net worth declined by a staggering 40 percent from 2007 to 2010, to $77,000; for households near retirement, ages 55 to 64, the decline was 33 percent, to $179,000. Home equity, once thought of as a cushion in retirement, has been especially devastated. The bursting of the housing bubble has erased nearly $6 trillion in equity, and left nearly 13 million people owing a total of $660 billion more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, according to Moody's Analytics.
A separate study by AARP has found that as of December 2011, people ages 50 and older accounted for 3.5 million underwater loans, with 1.2 million in or near foreclosure. That is on top of the more than 1.5 million older Americans who have already lost their homes in the bust since 2007.
Many people who are coming up short take refuge in the notion that they can continue working. But can they?
Working longer can help to rebuild savings, and, more important, allow one to delay taking Social Security, which improves the ultimate payout. As a practical matter, however, keeping a job is no sure thing. Workers ages 55 to 64 have been less likely than younger ones to lose their jobs in recent years; their jobless rate has averaged 6.1 percent in the past year, compared with 7.3 percent for workers ages 25 to 54. But when older workers become unemployed, they are much more likely to be out of work for long periods and less likely to find new jobs, while those who do become re-employed usually take a big pay cut.
More saving is clearly needed, along with ways to protect retirement savings from devastating downturns. The question is how. In addition to strengthening and preserving Social Security, the nation needs new forms of retirement coverage, along the lines of the ''Automatic Individual Retirement Accounts'' that President Obama has proposed in recent budgets, which would require companies that did not offer retirement plans to automatically divert 3 percent of an employee's pay into an I.R.A., unless the employee opted out. A similar plan was recently proposed by Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa.
The proposals are not cure-alls, but they could be important steps toward an ultimate aim of expanding retirement coverage and reducing reliance on 401(k)'s, which have proved far too vulnerable to investing mistakes and market downturns to be the core of a retirement plan.
Millions of Americans are headed for insecure retirements, but with new policies, millions more could escape that fate.

THE END OF MENAnd the Rise of Women
By Hanna Rosin310 pp. Riverhead Books. $27.95.
''The End of Men''? This is not a title; it is a sound bite. But Hanna Rosin means it. The revolution feminists have been waiting for, she says, is happening now, before our very eyes. Men are losing their grip, patriarchy is crumbling and we are reaching ''the end of 200,000 years of human history and the beginning of a new era'' in which women -- and womanly skills and traits -- are on the rise. Women around the world, she reports, are increasingly dominant in work, education, households; even in love and marriage. The stubborn fact that in most countries women remain underrepresented in the higher precincts of power and still don't get equal pay for equal work seems to her a quaint holdover, ''the last artifacts of a vanishing age rather than a permanent configuration.'' 
And to whom do we owe this astonishing revolution? If there is a hero in Rosin's story, it is not women or men or progressive politics: it is the new service economy, which doesn't care about physical strength but instead apparently favors ''social intelligence, open communication, the ability to sit still and focus'' -- things that ''are, at a minimum, not predominantly the province of men'' and ''seem to come easily to women.'' And so, ''for the first time in history, the global economy is becoming a place where women are finding more success than men.''
Human history? Global economy? Her evidence for women the globe over consists of thin, small facts cherry-picked to support outsize claims. We read, for example, that ''women in poor parts of India'' are rushing ahead of their male counterparts to learn English so that they can man call centers. But will this impressive display of initiative really liberate them? And even if it did, are we to deduce a country from a call center?
But Rosin's real focus is the United States, and here she delivers a blizzard of numbers, studies, statistics. Consider: By 2009 there were as many women as men in the work force, and today the average wife contributes some 42.2 percent of her family's income -- up sharply from the 2 percent to 6 percent that women contributed in 1970. The future, Rosin says, looks brighter for women still. For every two men who will get a bachelor's degree this year, there will be three women graduates. And even if they remain underrepresented at the top of just about everything, they have ''started to dominate'' in lower-profile professions like accounting, financial management, optometry, dermatology, forensic pathology and veterinary practices, among ''hundreds of others.''
Rosin has invented comic-book characters to explain the momentous changes she sees: ''Cardboard Man'' is rigid, stuck in old habits, mentally muscle-bound and unable to adapt to the fleet-footed and mercurial global economy. ''Plastic Woman'' (an unfortunate name choice, given the surgical ''adaptability'' it calls to mind) is infinitely malleable, nimble and endowed with ''traditionally feminine attributes, like empathy, patience and communal problem-solving,'' that make her the perfect match for the new economy. For her, the only way forward is up.
But this ''rise,'' which Rosin so cheerfully reports, is in fact a devastating social collapse. It starts with inequality and class division. As Rosin herself shows, men at ''the top'' of society are not ''ending.'' It is all happening to the lower and middle classes, because ''the end of men'' is the end of a manufacturing-based economy and the men who worked there, many of whom are now unemployed, depressed, increasingly dependent on the state and women to support them. We know the numbers, and they are bad: since 2000 the manufacturing economy has lost six million jobs, a third of its total work force -- much of it male. In 1950, 1 in 20 men in their prime were not working; today the number is a terrifying 1 in 5.
And so, a new matriarchy is emerging, run by young, ambitious, capable women who -- faced with men who can't or won't be full partners -- are taking matters into their own hands. For the poor, things are especially tough. One single mother Rosin interviewed fell asleep standing in the elevator of the community college where she was studying to get her degree -- between caring for three children and working a night job. No wonder these women don't want to get or stay married: unless a man can pull his weight, he is just another mouth to feed. But as Rosin herself points out, the new matriarchy is no feminist paradise. To the contrary: we have been here before with African-American women, and it is not a happy story.
The matriarchy isn't just happening at the low-income end; it is happening among the middle classes too. Take the young women who are flocking to school to become pharmacists, one of Rosin's favorite fast-feminizing professions. Giddy at the prospect of a $100K salary and certain they will never not work, even if they have children, these women are planning for lives without men -- or without reliable men.
That goes for the bedroom as well. If you thought today's ''hookup'' culture was run by young testosterone-charged men who want sex and no commitment, think again. Rosin insists that women are often in charge and the primary beneficiaries. A steady relationship with a guy, as one researcher puts it, is like adding an extra course to an already full load. Who needs it? These women have ''hearts of steel,'' and the hookup culture gives them sex without getting in the way of career-building. Yet Rosin's interviews with these young women are at times heartbreaking; they really do want love in their lives.
Hookups notwithstanding, college-educated men and women are more likely to marry and less likely to divorce. And although women still do a majority of the child care, men are changing, Rosin says; they are becoming, well, more like women: flexi-, plastic men willing -- wanting -- to share in domestic life. Some workplaces are changing too, and some women are finding more ways to work and have children. Everyone is happier.
Except, of course, that everyone is not -- or not quite. Rosin's chapter on women at ''the top'' indulges the soul-searching of educated women trying to ''have it all.'' She gives us Silicon Valley as today's mecca, insisting that companies like Google and Facebook -- flexible, new-economy places -- are (in spite of their notorious frat-house cultures) solving the problems of women and children and work. But while I'm happy to learn that a woman at Google persuaded her boss to fly her child and her nanny with her around the world business class, this hardly seems a viable economic model for most companies, or most mothers.
And what about Rosin's faith in the adage that for women to make it to the top, you need to get women like Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, to the top so that they can ''remake the workplace in their own image''? Sandberg aside, we know this doesn't necessarily work: women aren't always, or even usually, looking out for other women -- or even being nice to them. Many prefer to work with men; and some are willing to put in the long hours it takes to wrest their way up the chain of command.
In the end, there is something smug -- and wrong -- about Rosin's depiction of ''Plastic Woman.'' Is it really a good idea to say that we are, by gender if not by sex, open, empathic, flexible, patient, prone to communal problem-solving and the like? We've known for a long time that men do not hold a monopoly on being rigid, hierarchical, close-minded or authoritarian. Yet the women in this book are almost all organized go-getters, whereas the men come across as lazy, unambitious couch potatoes.
It is hard not to cringe when Rosin compares a Type A girl who sits still in school and makes pages of to-do lists every night with a sloppier but equally high-performing boy who can barely remember what comes next in his day. Rosin holds the girl (her daughter) up to the light and suggests that the boy (her son) will need to find his own ''inner secretary'' if he is to succeed in the world we live in. Well, maybe, but everything in me wants to defend the boy for just being who he is. Do we really want an alpha-girl model, even if she does succeed in the new world economy, whatever that is? Do we want a model at all? Why should a son -- or anyone, for that matter -- want to be more like anyone else (much less his sister -- or mother)?
Above all, is it really a good idea to suggest that women are poised to inherit the economy and that over time men and boys, God bless them, may learn to adjust and become more -- more what? More like us (except when we're not)? To suggest, in other words, that success -- material, social, sexual, emotional -- depends on (our!) gender traits and not on the legal and institutional frameworks we live in? I'm all for each of us remaking ourselves from within, but this kind of argument seems carelessly apolitical, especially at a moment when we are faced with public officials actively working to undermine access to birth control, abortion, equal pay for equal work. Talk about endings.
And I can't share Rosin's rosy faith in the global economy. Revolutions, economic or otherwise, have a way of disappointing women. They tear down the old, women step in and make strides, and as a new order sets in the strides disappear. Are Rosin's Plastic Women genuine victors, or are they -- or will they become -- unwitting victims? Will the women who are so diligently training themselves as pharmacists today be as flexible and confident when the winds of the feckless global economy turn against them? How flexible can a woman be when she has been training for something for years and suddenly it is blown off the map by the ''new'' economy? Ask the men who are ended.

 BODY:
ARGUABLY: Essays, by Christopher Hitchens. (Twelve, $18.) The esophageal cancer that killed Hitchens last December throws a shadow over this provocative collection, one of the Book Review's 10 Best Books of 2011. Nearly 800 pages and containing more than 100 essays, it addresses an extraordinary range of topics, including Afghanistan, Harry Potter, Thomas Jefferson, waterboarding, Henry VIII, Saul Bellow and the Ten Commandments.
THE FEAR INDEX, by Robert Harris. (Vintage, $15.) Harris, whose historical thrillers include ''Fatherland'' (1992) and ''Pompeii'' (2003), sets this novel -- a variation of Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'' -- in the rarefied world of hedge funds. At its center is a form of artificial intelligence that has achieved huge returns by using trading algorithms that ''thrive on panic.'' 
MIDNIGHT RISING: John Brown and the Raid That Sparked the Civil War, by Tony Horwitz. (Picador, $18.) Horwitz's account of the attack on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Va., in October 1859, moves nimbly through John Brown's deepening involvement in the abolitionist movement, and sets his devotion alongside the growing national conflict over slavery. ''It's impossible to read this fine book without thinking about the modern-day Browns,'' our reviewer, Kevin Boyle, wrote.
THE SONG OF ACHILLES, by Madeline Miller. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $14.99.) Following in the footsteps of Mary Renault (''The King Must Die,'' 1958) and David Malouf (''Ransom,'' 2009), Miller fashions a modern work out of a Greek classic: her first novel recasts the Trojan War as a love story featuring Achilles -- strong, swift, beautiful -- and his highborn companion Patroclus. Stephen Mitchell's lean, energetic translation of Homer's ILIAD (Free Press, $15.99) features a ''minimally iambic five-beat line'' and strips away hundreds of lines of ''probable interpolations'' printed in other modern texts. ''My intention throughout,'' Mitchell writes, ''has been to recreate the ancient epic as a contemporary poem in the parallel universe of the English language.''
CLASS WARFARE: Inside the Fight to Fix America's Schools, by Steven Brill. (Simon & Schuster, $17.) Brill mounts a vigorous case against teachers' unions in this investigative work, which collects the testimony of idealistic educators, charter school founders, policy gurus, crusading school superintendents and philanthropists to convey the setbacks and triumphs of a national reform movement.
THE GRIEF OF OTHERS, by Leah Hager Cohen. (Riverhead, $16.) Complex but fundamentally decent characters hurt one another and are hurt by forces greater than themselves in this absorbing novel, as a family sinks beneath the weight of a terrible secret. ''Leah Hager Cohen is one of our foremost chroniclers of the mundane complexities, nuanced tragedies and unexpected tendernesses of human connection,'' Susann Cokal wrote here.
CHINA IN TEN WORDS, by Yu Hua. Translated by Allan H. Barr. (Anchor, $15.) These essays each center on a particular word -- starting with ''people'' and ending with ''bamboozle'' -- and present a panoramic view of the Chinese experience over the last several decades, depicting a nation plagued by escalating unemployment, class polarization and endemic corruption and waste.

ON A FARTHER SHOREThe Life and Legacy of Rachel Carson
By William SouderIllustrated. 496 pp. Crown Publishers. $30.
On the bookshelves of many a contemporary environmental journalist looms at least one canonical text she's hesitant to read. For this reviewer, it was Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring,'' among the gloomiest books ever written, an unrelenting catalog of crimes committed by man against nature. But after reading William Souder's engrossing new biography of Carson, ''On a Farther Shore,'' I returned to the book and discovered its central message to be -- depressingly -- timeless. Substitute organic pesticides and herbicides with the endocrine-disrupting compounds found in everyday household items or the creep of chemicals used in hydrofracking, and you may experience the same hair-prickling alarm felt by Carson's readers 50 years ago. 
''Silent Spring'' was a clarion call that helped pave the way toward establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency, tighter controls on the use of chemicals and other regulatory achievements. But success for its unassuming and enigmatic middle-aged author was no fluke, as Souder makes abundantly clear. By the time Carson signed her contract for this book, she had written scores of magazine and newspaper articles and three best-selling books about the sea, one of which, the lyrical ''Sea Around Us,'' had been serialized in The New Yorker. She was considered the nation's pre-eminent nature writer. Her great themes, novel to many Americans at the time, were the biological forces that link all life through the ages, the interdependence of living organisms and the continual cycling of nutrients and genetic material through species and over time.
Before Carson became a superstar of narrative nonfiction -- showered with awards, honorary degrees and speaking offers -- she was a mild-mannered government drone who spent 16 years writing press releases and pamphlets for what eventually became the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. It was a perfect job for a biophiliac (Carson was an avid bird-watcher) who excelled at doing homework and massaging experts for information. (Though Carson had a master's in zoology, she never worked as a scientist. And while she felt drawn to the sea and specialized in matters oceanic, she spent little time on the water, rarely ventured deeper than her ankles and never corrected the media's presumption that she was a frequent diver.)
But even as Carson churned out propaganda, she was reading and collecting government reports on the unintended consequences of pesticide use. By 1946, she had serious doubts not only about pesticides' safety but about government's ability -- or will -- to protect environmental health over economic interests. By the summer of 1962, when The New Yorker excerpted three chapters of ''Silent Spring,'' her audience was primed for science-and-technology-related anxiety. Americans knew about birth defects caused by thalidomide, a supposedly safe drug; they'd weathered a ''cranberry scare,'' in which pesticide-contaminated fruit was pulled from the market just days before Thanksgiving; and they'd learned to ''duck and cover'' in anticipation of a nuclear attack.
Carson artfully linked radioactive fallout with the indiscriminate use of pesticides; they were, Souder writes, the ''twin fears of the modern age.'' The parallels between the chemicals were, to Carson, exact and inescapable: both were invisible, acutely toxic, mutagenic and had effects that could last for generations. Such negative impacts, Carson believed, were the consequence of the ''impetuous and heedless pace of man rather than the deliberate pace of nature.''
Carson had a knack for encapsulating big ideas and for saying exactly what she meant. Her voice could be clear and plain (''The problem that concerns us here . . . '') or poetical (she feared ''a sterile world ungraced by the curving wing of a bird in flight''). But none of this came easily. Souder paints Carson as an obsessive reviser and a meticulous researcher who was often blocked, she said, by her uneasiness that human beings had acquired the power to reshape the world so profoundly.
Souder is at his best when he places Carson's intellectual development in context with the nascent environmental movement. The storm over ''Silent Spring,'' he notes, was a ''cleaving point'' in history when the ''gentle, optimistic proposition called 'conservation' began its transformation into the bitterly divisive idea that would come to be known as 'environmentalism.''' (Souder isn't shy about expressing his own disappointment with what he views as a permanent wall between partisans, with nature and science pitted against an ''unbreakable coalition of government and industry, the massed might of the establishment.'')
As Carson and her publisher expected, the chemical industry pounced on ''Silent Spring'' -- even as it climbed best-seller lists -- for overstating the downside and ignoring the upsides of pesticides. (Souder quotes Carson directly defending herself only once. California, one of the few states with accurate records, she said, was reporting ''as many as 1,000 accidental poisonings a year.'' That might be good enough for Souder, but we never learn if the victims were crickets, catbirds or campesinos.) More significant, because they linger to this day, were the attacks that cast ecology as a subversive subject and Carson as a Communist. To love nature, in this absolutist paradigm, is to abhor business, to reject capitalism and by extension America itself. One chemical company claimed that by condemning pesticides (in fact, the book argued only for limits and restraint in their use), Carson hoped to reduce our food supply to ''East-curtain parity.''
Souder writes vividly and with great empathy for his subject and her cause. But steeped in Carsoniana, he occasionally slips into her old-fashioned locutions (''And so you see that . . . ''), or even into grandiosity (Carson has ''the voice of someone standing above this elemental environment and feeling within it the slow pulse of geologic time and the mighty force of evolution that lies inside and beyond the surging waters''). One wishes, also, that the author had paid more attention to gender politics: he doesn't explain how Carson managed to write four intensely researched books while running a household, managing the financial affairs of her family and, later, raising her orphaned grandnephew. Nor does he fully explore Carson's unconventional romantic arrangement. He sketches the outlines of her 11-year intimate relationship with a married woman named Dorothy Freeman but fails to explain how or if Freeman's husband, Stanley, dealt with it.
But these points detract little from an absorbing narrative. In Souder's telling, almost every aspect of Carson's life and times becomes captivating: her difficult personal circumstances (she grew up in rural poverty, was the sole breadwinner in her family and battled breast cancer while writing and then defending ''Silent Spring''); the publishing milieu; and the continuing friction between those who would preserve nature versus those who would bend it to provide utility for man.
Souder warms up slowly, presenting Carson as a mild and mousy girl who fell into her career thanks to a charismatic mentor. As she matured, however, Carson quietly simmered with attitude, indignation and, once she became more successful, a righteous ego. Released from government service and financial peril, she roared at the forces she believed were destroying nature, her greatest source of pleasure and the thing without which, to pervert the classic advertising slogan of the agricultural chemical manufacturer Monsanto, life itself would be impossible.

 BODY:
BEAUTIFUL LIESBy Clare Clark
500 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $26.
Clare Clark's fiction manages to maintain historical accuracy even as it indulges in great storytelling and lush prose. In her first novel, ''The Great Stink,'' a thriller that takes place in the sewers of Victorian London, Clark wrote with such rich detail that you could almost smell the fetid air as you turned the pages. In ''Savage Lands,'' she transported readers to the young colony of Louisiana in the early 1700s, setting a complex love story against a fecund yet relentlessly cruel landscape that became as important to the plot as the characters themselves.
In her new novel, ''Beautiful Lies,'' Clark leaves behind the swamps of the New World and returns to Victorian Britain -- and she does so with panache. Her central character, Maribel Campbell Lowe, is the beautiful, chain-smoking wife of a radical Scottish M.P., Edward Campbell Lowe. Born Maria Isabel Constanza de la Flamandire -- or so she says -- Maribel claims to be a Chilean heiress. But the reader gradually learns that her life is built on lies. When a newspaper editor named Alfred Webster begins to circle Maribel like a vulture, this carefully constructed web is in danger of collapsing. One pull on a thread might unravel the whole. 
The novel's scenes of 1887 London are strangely redolent of the present day: there is an economic crisis as well as lurid journalism; riots shake London, and Trafalgar Square is occupied, with the police fighting against protesters. Instead of the Olympics, the crowd puller is Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, which two and a half million visitors enjoyed in a mere six months.
As in her previous novels, Clark takes real events as her inspiration but allows herself the freedom to invent and embellish. Her historical research is immaculate without being overbearing. Edward Campbell Lowe is based on Robert Cunninghame Graham, an eccentric radical Scottish aristocrat who became a founder of the Scottish Labour Party -- which laid the foundation for the modern-day Labour Party in the United Kingdom. Maribel's character was inspired by his wife, Gabriela.
At its heart, ''Beautiful Lies'' is about the kaleidoscopic nature of reality. What is truth -- and what is Maribel's truth? Can a lie become a fact if we start believing in our own illusions? Maribel is an aspiring photographer, and her art becomes a tool in her fight both against Webster and against her own demons; but photography also provides a clever narrative device, a useful vehicle to explore the play of truth and lies. Maribel takes a picture of the Native Americans on the set of Buffalo Bill's Wild West, a picture that, ''if not strictly true, had the weight of truth about it.'' Clark plays dexterously with this notion, placing photographs into Maribel's hands that apparently depict ''ghosts'' and superimposed images that merge different scenes into one photograph. ''So the camera lies,'' the owner of Maribel's darkroom says. But does it?
In Clark's ever evocative language there is a visceral feel to Maribel's emotions (as when a flustered Maribel is ''inhaling the charcoal-scented air, exhaling Mr. Webster'') and her sense of the evanescence of life (''in those dying weeks of summer''). A friend Maribel views through her camera is ''pinned beneath the glass like a butterfly,'' and when she's alone Maribel feels Edward's absence ''like a bruise in her chest.'' In Clark's prose, even the inanimate can acquire a new dimension: a row of neat terrace houses exudes respectability as they ''bore themselves with the prim self-effacement of maiden aunts.''
As always, Clark doesn't rush through her plot. She develops the story gently, with revelations about Maribel's past folded carefully into scenes from the present, yielding a complex tapestry of tales. A captivating fable of truth and memory, ''Beautiful Lies'' speaks to us quietly yet with strength.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Has America Lost Its Way?

 BODY:
Readers discuss whether the country is on the right track.
To the Editor:
We often hear variations on a common lament: America has lost its way; the country is on the wrong track. These are valid opinions on an urgent topic, but one requiring scrutiny. Is the primary measurement economic, cultural, social or some combination? There may be consensus about misdirection, but stark disagreement over causes. Some, for example, praise environmental regulations for protecting people and the planet, while others condemn them for impeding economic growth.
If the country has veered off course, when did it begin? Some say 2008, pointing to the economic crisis or Barack Obama's election; others insist on 2000, with the advent of George W. Bush. We hear that the 1980s marked a dangerous turning point, with the widening gap between rich and poor, and the creeping influence of money in politics. But wait: The 1960s are alternately lauded or blamed for social and cultural innovations.
The 1950s deserve a closer look, a decade when Americans started imagining that economic prosperity was permanent, almost a birthright. Yet the stultifying pressures toward conformity ultimately prompted objections from many quarters. 
Another narrative is possible, one accounting for fundamental progress. The great, and I hope continuing, expansion in civil and human rights for workers, women, and racial, sexual and ethnic minorities puts the promise of American life in reach for most of us at last. Returning to the ''good (bad) old days'' would be tragic.
It may not be that America is losing its way, but that other countries, in economic terms, are finding theirs. There is more competition, but also prosperous and thus beneficial trading partners.
Perhaps there are numerous right paths in our interconnected world. For America, perhaps finding the right course is an unending challenge, central to the national experience. We should have the audacity to hope that this is so.
THOMAS PYKE JOHNSON Boston, Sept. 10, 2012
The writer teaches in the history departments of the University of Massachusetts Boston and Bentley University and works at the Mugar Memorial Library of Boston University.
Readers React
America is not on the wrong track. But the track we are on is a bit rusty, and we sometimes confuse our priorities.
Laws enacted for the public good (federal regulation of industry, especially the securities and banking domains, and environmental laws) are denigrated by so-called conservatives as harmful.
At the end of World War II the United States, flush with victory, started on a constructive path. Even though we had a very high national debt, we continued public support of education, with the G.I. Bill providing many returning war veterans the opportunity to further their educations. We did not complain about taxes, and we gradually lowered the debt.
Somewhere along the way we did get careless. It was a bipartisan effort to shred the regulatory structures enacted in the 1930s after the Depression.
Where were those so-called conservatives when we allowed ourselves to be convinced that the Iraq war was a good idea? That it was an even better idea to have our children and grandchildren pay for it?
The track is still there, but it does need some maintenance, and that is a job for the whole country. A strong federal government is the best agent to get it done.
PAUL COOLEY Culver City, Calif., Sept. 12, 2012
The day ''I'' became more compelling than ''we'' is the day we lost our way.
That day occurred sometime during the 1960s. The music was phenomenal, the politics frenzied and the social progress extraordinary, but we embraced pleasure over productivity.
President John F. Kennedy admonished us to ''ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.'' But our narcissism drove society into separate ideological orbits. Our refusal to bridge the divide with those who thought differently was the radioactive fallout of that time, and it continues to poison political and social dialogue to this day.
Our lost ability to embrace the ''we'' will be our downfall.
MARK ROMAN New York, Sept. 12, 2012
My candidate for who got America off track is Newt Gingrich and his Contract With America. In fact, it was less the contract itself than the deepening of the adversarial relationship of the two parties and the impeachment of Bill Clinton.
It resulted in the determination of Republicans to ''make Barack Obama a one-term president'' by blocking legislation to carry out his initiatives and leading to the debt-ceiling debate, in which some Republicans were willing to see the country default.
MARY ZINS Miami, Sept. 12, 2012
Is ''the promise of American life in reach for most of us at last,'' as Mr. Johnson suggests? Have we made as much progress as he says in expanding civil and human rights for those groups who have been struggling for a better life for too many generations?
I strongly disagree with his assumption that ''another narrative'' of ''fundamental progress'' somehow erases the evidence that we are becoming a more deeply divided country, with many Americans in the shrinking middle class far more likely to fall into poverty than to enjoy new wealth.
What makes life truly worthwhile for the majority of Americans is high-quality education, affordable health care and the opportunity to enjoy leisure time with family and friends. We see that the expansion of wealth for a small percentage of Americans has not led to economic growth that benefits society as a whole.
Mr. Johnson believes that finding the right course to a brighter future is an unending challenge, and he may be right. But any path that fails to address the growing income gap is a road to nowhere.
PETER SCHMIDT Phillipsburg, N.J., Sept. 12, 2012
Mr. Johnson neatly summarized criticism of America: our country is wandering on the wrong path, whether measured economically, socially or culturally.
He noted that our collective disillusionment, if that's what it is, may have begun as early as the 1950s. Yet it may be deeper than his summary and more persistent than his optimism in our overcoming challenges from foreign competition.
Fear, exhaustion and hopelessness entered American society while it restored a shattered world, met the Communist challenge and created domestic prosperity. Whether we are pessimists or optimists, Americans now require a dose of confidence -- a renewed faith in our society and ourselves. That renewal, if it comes at all, will be by ordinary people doing extraordinary things and a society that allows their creativity.
After all, America has a history of rebirths. That should give us some confidence in our future and ourselves.
DONALD E. DAVIS Normal, Ill., Sept. 12, 2012
The writer is professor emeritus of history at Illinois State University.
For me, the problem with the direction of this country is not the economy or social or cultural issues but the vitriol and divisiveness of our leaders in Congress. I often wonder what their goal really is: having one party left standing?
The two-party system, a foundation of our country, seems to be going the way of the typewriter. The vitriol expressed by both sides in this presidential campaign leads me to believe that any thought of civility and compromise belongs in the last century.
How can our country survive and prosper when each side claims to know the ''truth'' of what is wrong and how to fix it? This toxic environment needs to be addressed before the rest of our problems can be dealt with.
LINDA DRUM Jericho, N.Y., Sept. 12, 2012
To describe the nation as being on the right or wrong ''track'' may be useful for pollsters assessing gut-level confidence in America's future. But can we thoughtfully discuss the nation's progress (including the complex courses of commerce, education, science and technology, politics, economy, foreign relations, public health, individual rights and so on) based on the supremely simplistic notion that America has at any given time a single track or direction? I don't think so.
DONALD TWIEG Birmingham, Ala., Sept. 13, 2012
The Writer Responds
America has unfinished business, and that's how it should be. If these thoughtful replies share something in common, it is this.
Several are specific in highlighting challenges and solutions. Mr. Cooley provides the neat metaphor of a rusty railroad requiring maintenance. Ms. Zins identifies Newt Gingrich as a major culprit in steering America off track. Agreed, but the ex-congressman is more symptom than cause of malaise.
One point questioned by Mr. Schmidt requires clarification. ''The promise of American life in reach of most of us'' is partly from the editor's hand, not mine. I originally wrote ''the majority'' instead of ''most,'' and now prefer simply ''more.'' This is less sanguine, and I hope places us closer to consensus.
Mr. Schmidt disagrees with the suggested narrative of ''fundamental progress,'' but it supplements, not supplants or erases, the reality of deep divisions. It is hard to grasp the trajectory of change -- whether rise or decline -- from momentary snapshots when moving pictures are better. But concerns over economic inequality are well taken.
We must consider the whole world in this discussion. Many of us cannot see, or choose to deny, that long-term structural changes in political economy are afoot, affecting American relations with others. This is not necessarily deplorable. All powers rise and fall, sometimes repeatedly, as Chinese history shows.
In concluding, I recommend the journalist Eric Sevareid's 1946 book ''Not So Wild a Dream.'' It exemplifies an expansive confidence even during depression and war, with a sense of proportion and modesty about what's possible then and now. If it inspires us (not just ''I'') anew, this dialogue is well worthwhile.

HEADLINE: Dead Bank Walking

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Lehman Brothers is having a great year. The bank, which almost destroyed the global economy four years ago this week, recently emerged from bankruptcy, resolved a third of its debts and executed the largest U.S. real estate deal of the year. Today, the company appears an awful lot like a normal investment bank. Its trading floor -- on one of the two floors Lehman occupies in the Time & Life Building in Midtown Manhattan -- is filled with dozens of young people who stare at financial graphs on Bloomberg terminals and talk in the hallways about the deals they're working on. 
Except that Lehman's sole objective is to sell everything it owns so it can repay its lenders and disappear. The reason it has taken so long (and will take many more years) is that selling off the pieces of a big investment bank is almost ineffably complicated. Banks have few physical assets, and they go fast. (Lehman sold its headquarters the day after its bankruptcy.) A bank's main value is really just a huge pile of promises. Banks borrow money (often from other banks) and promise to pay it back; then they lend that money (again, often to other banks) on the promise that they'll return it, too. Every bank could collapse if more than a small percentage of people ask for their money at once.
The system works because lenders have confidence that if there's ever a run on a bank, governments and central banks will step in and limit the damage. Of all the financial calamity that Lehman inflicted on international markets, perhaps the most significant was that it came close to destroying that confidence. And one reason this sluggish economy persists is that investors still haven't got it back.
Much of our continued distress, as measured in bond rates and fewer loans issued, comes down to a lingering fear that another bank (or for that matter, a country) could collapse. Lehman's long unwinding has only worsened these fears. Like all big banks, Lehman was more like a loose agglomeration of hundreds of individual companies. Its bankruptcy affected thousands of subsidiary entities and triggered filings in 80 jurisdictions around the world. This led, immediately, to several conflicts. The now-separate divisions in the United States and Switzerland, for instance, are still negotiating exactly how much they owe each other.
The Lehman Brothers office in Midtown makes up around a third of the original company, in terms of assets, and is responsible for paying back $360 billion in more than 60,000 claims. It has already distributed around $22 billion and estimated that it will pay back another $40 billion -- giving investors an average of 18 percent of that $360 billion -- by the time it closes its doors completely, some time after 2017. The company's entire business objective is to fulfill the terms of a 791-page legal document listing all of its unfulfilled financial promises. The task is even more overwhelming than it first appears. Each creditor is owed a different percentage based on the type of loan it gave and which division the creditor gave it to. Investors who lent money to Lehman's commercial-paper subsidiary get a return of 56 cents on the dollar; those who bought a bond from the parent company are getting a little more than 20 cents. And each of those creditors can pursue a challenge and demand more money. One of the new Lehman's busiest departments, not surprisingly, is legal.
Why would anyone lend money to any institution if there was a chance, once trouble hit, that they would have to wait years to get 20 cents on the dollar? U.S. officials have tried to stanch the loss of confidence by claiming that they have now solved the problems of Lehman. The core solution -- as stated in Title II of the Dodd-Frank reforms -- is predicated on the notion that the problem wasn't Lehman's overinvestment in sketchy real estate deals but rather that the U.S. government did not have the powers it needed to wind it down. The law, at the time, only allowed for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to step in and take over a troubled U.S.-chartered bank. Lehman, though, was about 2,000 companies, many outside the country and most of which weren't chartered as banks. The government could either bail the whole thing out or let everything fail.
The F.D.I.C. now has the power to take over a huge holding company, sell off the healthy parts, and -- in theory, at least -- manage a careful wind down. Last year, the F.D.I.C. released a remarkable paper, ''The Orderly Liquidation of Lehman Brothers Holdings Under the Dodd-Frank Act,'' which lays out how the agency would have saved Lehman if it possessed those new powers at the time of the collapse. The F.D.I.C. would instantly dismiss existing management and force total losses on all the shareholders, but work hard to keep all other promises. It would create a ''bridge bank,'' a carbon copy of Lehman, run by regulators, that would maintain the company's role in the global financial system while helping the company gradually disappear. By their own reckoning, the new powers would have meant far more money for creditors -- 97 cents on every dollar, not 18 -- in far less time.
Most people in finance are glad that officials will have more options for taking on the next crisis, but the stingy lending environment suggests that they are not persuaded that the problem has been solved. While the law now requires the largest financial institutions to disclose all their important subsidiaries, it is up to each bank to decide which ones are important. The major banks have each disclosed a dozen or so firms, but still keep thousands of others -- some of which might be carrying massive risk -- hidden. The F.D.I.C. strategy also assumes that global regulators will happily cooperate as the U.S. government takes over a huge bank and eliminates the value of all its shares, including those owned by foreigners. The F.D.I.C.'s Lehman report deals with the massive challenge in one sentence: ''The F.D.I.C. would have contacted the relevant foreign and domestic regulatory authorities and governments to coordinate the resolution.''
The main lesson of Lehman's collapse is that the response to a troubled financial system is, ultimately, determined not by technical regulation, but by politics. The F.D.I.C. can use its new powers only after receiving the consent of the Treasury secretary. And its new powers pertain only to those banks deemed systematically important, a designation determined by political appointees. So while the F.D.I.C. is working to formalize the rules governing its new powers, investment-bank lobbying has grown by nearly 60 percent since the crisis began. Bankers learned that they need to be closer than ever to politicians.
Kenneth Rogoff, who co-wrote the pre-eminent history of financial crises, ''This Time Is Different,'' told me that crises don't end because new laws are enacted and politicians can be trusted again. In 1945, ''the financial markets were devastated,'' he said. ''State and local governments had defaulted on everything. Lending had shrunk.'' Somehow, though, the economy recovered and experienced nearly 30 years of robust growth. Confidence comes, he said, when ''enough time passes so everyone forgets there was ever a problem.'' I was thinking about this as I walked through the new Lehman headquarters and overheard one employee brag about a real estate deal he had just made. (After all, the advisory firm Alvarez & Marsal could earn more than $600 million from winding down Lehman.) But the larger fact is that Lehman, which once seemed essential to the economy, is slowly disappearing. That few even know that this is happening in the Time & Life Building suggests that our confidence may not be far away.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Lehman is still alive.
1.5. Sort of.
2. And few people have noticed.
3. Which is the best news possible.

HEADLINE: The Tuition Jackpot

BYLINE: By TED C. FISHMAN

 BODY:
Wings Stadium, a dim, beery sports barn in Kalamazoo, Mich., is an appropriate home for the K-Wings minor-league hockey team and the Killamazoo Derby Darlins. Yet every year, in June, the site hosts a spectacle more uplifting than a season of flip checks. This is when it is the setting for the graduations of the city's two main high schools. A couple of nights after Kalamazoo Central High fills the arena, it's Loy Norrix's turn. The rink is covered, and students, friends and family take over most of the 5,100 seats.
According to census data, 39 percent of Kalamazoo's students are white, and 44 percent are African-American. One of every three students in the Kalamazoo district falls below the national poverty level. One in 12 is homeless. Many of them are the first in their families to finish high school; many come from single-parent homes. Some are young parents themselves: Kalamazoo has one of the highest pregnancy rates among black teenagers in the state.
And yet, for the vast majority of the 500-plus students who graduate each year in Kalamazoo, a better future really does await after they collect their diplomas. The high-school degrees come with the biggest present most of them will ever receive: free college. 
Back in November 2005, when this year's graduates were in sixth grade, the superintendent of Kalamazoo's public schools, Janice M. Brown, shocked the community by announcing that unnamed donors were pledging to pay the tuition at Michigan's public colleges, universities and community colleges for every student who graduated from the district's high schools. All of a sudden, students who had little hope of higher education saw college in their future. Called the Kalamazoo Promise, the program -- blind to family income levels, to pupils' grades and even to disciplinary and criminal records -- would be the most inclusive, most generous scholarship program in America.
It would also mark the start of an important social experiment. From the very beginning, Brown, the only person in town who communicates directly with the Promise donors, has suggested that the program is supposed to do more than just pay college bills. It's primarily meant to boost Kalamazoo's economy. The few restrictions -- among them, children must reside in the Kalamazoo public-school district and graduate from one of its high schools -- seem designed to encourage families to stay and work in the region for a long time. The program tests how place-based development might work when education is the first investment.
''Other communities invest in things like arenas or offer tax incentives for businesses or revitalize their waterfronts,'' says Michelle Miller-Adams, a political scientist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, which is located in the city. ''The Kalamazoo Promise tries to develop the local economy with a long-term investment in human capital that is intended to change the town from the bottom up.'' In this regard, the Promise can be seen as an exorbitant ante, staked by private funds, that calls to Kalamazoo's better angels. It stokes hometown pride, prods citizens to engage and pulls businesses and their leaders into the public sphere. To date, Miller-Adams says, Kalamazoo's Promise has inspired donors in 25 other cities and towns around the United States -- including Pittsburgh, New Haven and El Dorado, Ark. -- to start, or consider starting, similar programs.
Student orators at the June graduations thanked their teachers and parents. A few moms shouted out, ''We love you!'' When the speakers, their eyes scanning the stands for signs of their unseen benefactors, thanked ''the anonymous donors of the Kalamazoo Promise,'' Wings Stadium filled up with hollers, horns and whistles.
Without your gift, Kalamazoo may have swirled into a downfall, similar to many of the other cities in Michigan.
From a letter to the donors by Sam Barton, Loy Norrix High School, class of 2012
Kalamazoo, population 74,000, anchors a metro region of 326,000. It sits halfway between Chicago and Detroit. Since its beginnings, it has been a capital of one industry or another. In the early 20th century, it was Celery City. Then manufacturing took over; even during the Depression, the region had more than 150 local factories. Gibson guitars and Checker cabs were made near downtown. By the late 1950s, Kalamazoo was Paper City, one of the most productive paper-mill towns in the world. In 1966, General Motors opened a stamping plant that would employ 4,000 workers. That number dropped to 1,700 by late 1994, however, and less than a decade later Checker, the big paper mills and G.M. were gone. What local industries remained then turned to the playbook of manufacturers all over the country: they consolidated, relocated to the South or abroad or automated their operations. The region has lost more than 16,000 jobs since 2007.
For decades, the prosperity of the homegrown Upjohn Company, controlled by the Upjohn family, cushioned the blows to Kalamazoo's economy. In the 1950s, the company built the world's largest pharmaceutical plant in Portage, outside Kalamazoo. With one of the world's most innovative drug laboratories and deepest portfolios of patented drugs, its research facilities alone supported as many as 3,000 highly skilled, well-paid workers.
In addition to providing jobs, Upjohn was a source of wide-ranging philanthropy, fostering a civic culture that served to attract and retain scientific and managerial talent. The company supported a public math and science academy. Its founder pushed to install Kalamazoo's first professional city manager. The family also propagated a philanthropic class that established mandarin amenities like the Kalamazoo Symphony Orchestra. Three postsecondary schools are located in town: Kalamazoo College, which is private, and Western Michigan University and Kalamazoo Valley Community College, which are public. Kalamazoo was an example of what modern urbanists extol as ''the creative city.''
After a century of independence, the Upjohn Company appointed its first nonfamily C.E.O. in 1987. In 2003, following nearly a decade of mergers, the company was folded into Pfizer, the world's largest pharmaceutical company. Pfizer shuttered the Kalamazoo labs and slashed operations. The big Portage factory is still open, but it's just an outpost in a huge empire.
Even as it endured setbacks, the area remained better off than much of the industrial Midwest. In Upjohn's shadow, for instance, a medical-device company called Stryker Corporation was developing a business making innovative hospital beds and artificial joints. But Kalamazoo's core was beset by poverty, unemployment, depressed property values and thoroughfares lined with dollar stores, storefront churches and charities for the needy. It looked like one of the country's bleakest industrial cities.
Local donors and business groups established assorted councils, forums and task forces to help the region; a parade of experts from far and wide came to town to present their blueprints for reinvention. One scheme raised the possibility of Kalamazoo privatizing its state-of-the-art sewer system, built when the city anticipated unlimited growth by the paper mills. ''We flirted with every fad,'' Randall Eberts, an economist who heads the Upjohn Institute, told me recently. ''We had committees on our 'regional edge,' on how to create 'industry clusters.' '' Eberts pulled out a 10-page chronology of 64 local revitalization efforts between 1997 and 2004 and laughed. ''The whole history of all the recent trends in economic development is right here; we've done everything.''
Then the Promise was made.
I am a triplet. . . . It's hard enough for a family to pay for college for one child, but three, at once -- now that's crazy. . . . It was my sixth-grade year when the donations were made and officially announced. I'm pretty sure that my mother cried.
Melia Scheck, Kalamazoo Central High School, class of 2012
''After the Promise was announced on the 11 o'clock news, the kids were up celebrating until 2 or 3 in the morning,'' Ron Cunliffe, a Kalamazoo dad with three children eligible for the Promise, says. ''We kept waiting for someone to say it was a joke.''
Under the terms of the program, students who start in the Kalamazoo school district as kindergartners receive enough money to cover their entire tuition to public in-state schools. Students who enter the district in later grades get less, based on a sliding scale; entering high-school freshmen, for example, get 65 percent of their tuition covered. (Those who move to Kalamazoo after that or who enroll in colleges that are private or located outside the state are not covered by the Promise.) To date, the Kalamazoo Promise has paid out $35 million for postsecondary study for 2,500 students. On average, about $4,200 is spent on each student per semester. Students are responsible for their own room and board.
A few years after the Promise was announced, Cunliffe lost his job as a pharmaceutical rep. He now makes about 40 percent of his former salary, an amount he says would have made college tuition tough to afford.
Xochitl Gonzalez, then a senior, was sitting in her homeroom when the vice principal at Kalamazoo Central announced over the P.A. that donors would pay for their college tuition. ''My classmates started crying,'' Gonzalez says. ''I cried, too. It seemed unreal. Before the announcement, a lot of my classmates weren't going to go to college. Afterward, everyone applied.'' Gonzalez was eligible to have 95 percent of her tuition paid. Now, just one semester shy of college graduation from Western Michigan University, she is taking a break. Her family was recently fighting to stave off foreclosure on its home and could not spare the few hundred dollars she needed to pay the rest of her tuition. Gonzalez expects to return for her final semester. The Promise allows students 10 years to finish up.
While Promise money goes to postsecondary-school education only, the program has nonetheless brought change to the Kalamazoo public schools. It gives district officials a powerful inducement with which to motivate students, families and teachers. Michael F. Rice, the superintendent who replaced Janice Brown, persuaded teachers in the city's middle schools -- several of which are near the bottom of Michigan's official school rankings -- to rejigger their schedules to move 120 hours a year into core-curriculum instruction. This enabled the schools to provide personalized remedial instruction in math and reading, after which 70 percent of the district's middle schoolers increased their proficiency by at least one grade in those subjects.
''Elsewhere in Michigan,'' says Julie Mack, an education reporter for The Kalamazoo Gazette, ''teachers are up in arms over budget cuts and new work demands. In Kalamazoo, with the Promise breathing life into the schools, teachers agreed to changes practically without any objections.''
High-school test scores in Kalamazoo have improved four years in a row. A higher percentage of African-American girls graduate from the district than they do in the rest of the state, and 85 percent of those go on to college. Overall, more than 90 percent of Kalamazoo's graduates today go on to higher education. Six in 10 go to Western Michigan University or Kalamazoo Valley Community College. And over time, a greater number of students are landing at the more selective University of Michigan and Michigan State.
Your interest in the community paid off, because at the time of the announcement, my family had been seriously considering leaving town.
Dylan Hawthorne, Loy Norrix High School, class of 2012
After seven years on the job, Janice Brown stepped down as superintendent. A fit, outdoorsy woman who can still race her small grandson on a bike, she was then prevailed upon to be executive director of the Kalamazoo Promise in the third year of the program. ''I told the donors I had no power after leaving the school system,'' she says, ''except for the network I built up while superintendent.'' Instead of a big staff -- one other employee pays the tuition bills, keeps track of Promise-eligible students and reviews borderline cases -- Brown wields her connections and the clout that comes from being the sole liaison to the donors. ''She's like Kalamazoo's Wizard of Oz,'' Eberts says. ''She kind of goes back behind the curtain, meets with the donors and communicates to the rest of us what she has to share.''
People in Kalamazoo have hunches about who the donors are. Some say they must be the Stryker family or former executives. Stryker now has 20,000 employees worldwide; $100 invested in its stock in 1982 would have been worth more than $25,000 in 2007. Three of the Strykers are billionaires, and two of them have worked in the Kalamazoo public schools. Others suggest the donors might be a group of people -- among them, perhaps, Derek Jeter, the Yankees shortstop and Kalamazoo Central High alum. The mystery is built into the Promise, encouraging the people of Kalamazoo to make it their own and respond in ways to get the most out of it.
When asked how the conversations that led to the Promise unfolded, Brown demurs. ''That, and the identity of the donors, are things I just will never talk about,'' she says. But she lets some things slip. ''The donors believed that education was the most important thing to invest in, period,'' she says, for instance. But she also acknowledges that the donors do regard their gift as a communitywide experiment.
The Promise donors saw how a school district in decline and a weakening economy created a vicious circle. Poor schools hindered Kalamazoo's ability to support businesses and bring in new ones, and as commercial activity suffered, the resources available to schools shrank. The Promise was created against a backdrop of recent economic thought that considers investment in education better than nearly every other kind of developmental effort when it comes to promoting economic growth. Eberts, for one, argues that if Kalamazoo prepares its students for college, the long-term return to the community will be an educated, innovative work force, a higher tax base and a more attractive business environment. Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, notes that well-educated people not only make more money individually; their interactions with everyone around them also amplify a community's wealth. The biggest difference in salaries between highly and lesser-educated regions is not found in the salaries of the elite but in those earned by lower-skilled workers. The spillover effects energize the economy at every level.
One of Brown's roles is to enlist as much of the community as possible -- businesses, government, neighborhood organizations, churches, health care providers, you name it -- in providing whatever kids need to get through school and into college. This means more than better schools; it includes better nutrition for children, better housing, medical care and, most urgently, universal prekindergarten programs. But Brown's is a delicate balancing act: businesses will not participate in anything that looks like an antipoverty program.
Brown's work on this front takes its most concrete form in the Learning Network, an umbrella organization financed by $11 million in seed money from the Kalamazoo Community Foundation and the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. Kellogg, located 20 minutes from Kalamazoo, in Battle Creek, is the nation's fifth-largest philanthropy and donates $360 million yearly to projects around the world, much of it on behalf of children's welfare. According to Sterling K. Speirn, the foundation's chief executive, it is granting money to early-childhood literacy programs in Kalamazoo partly because the Promise, by spending money on children when they're older, gives a boost to the money Kellogg spends on younger children today.
It was standing room only at the kickoff meeting for the Learning Network held at Western Michigan University in July. I tagged along with Brown, who was not officially running the show but was treated by the businesspeople, parents and community reps who collared her as if she were. Attendees scratched their heads at organization trees and squinted at a vast flowchart showing seven goals for eight committees and listing 42 sets of statistics on welfare and student achievement that had yet to be collected. Despite the wonky talk of ''benchmarks'' and ''consensus,'' the Network's success ultimately relies on what sociologists call mass action. This describes a population whose members are moving in the same direction without institutionalized leadership. Kalamazoo has organized around the Promise in such a way that no one is able to commandeer the collective effort; instead, citizens have to show up over and over, for one mind-numbing meeting after another, in order to network, brainstorm and keep trying to make things better. ''If we blow this,'' Brown says, ''we're not likely to get another Promise to get us going again.''
Peter Strazdas, the mayor of nearby Portage, says, ''We've been through a lot of these things before, but this one feels different, like it can really do something.''
Even with the Kalamazoo Promise, some of the students I know don't know if they'll be able to afford housing and food.
Tess Denton Duncan, Kalamazoo Central High School, class of 2012
In the 1970s, Kalamazoo, under legal pressure, tried to desegregate its schools through a combination of busing and school choice. But affluent white families fled the district, large numbers of them to suburban Portage. Brown says that in Kalamazoo, white flight was not sudden but a steady trickle. The school system was losing around 1 percent of its more affluent families, whites and others, every year for more than three decades. ''That's not a mass exodus,'' she says, ''but you can see how that can add up over time.''
The suburban flight stopped after the Promise was made. The city's population has held steady, and the demographic mix in the school system has stabilized.
In the first year after the Promise, 1,000 additional students enrolled in the Kalamazoo schools. Altogether, the student population has increased by 2,450 students, or 24 percent. With every added student, the school district gets another $7,250 from the state. A new teacher can be hired for every additional 25 students; 92 have been hired so far. The district has been able to upgrade facilities and, for the first time since the 1970s, passed bond issues to build new schools.
In an unexpected twist, the Promise is also challenging nearby suburbs to compete with Kalamazoo, strengthening the region. The Portage district, which grew at the expense of the Kalamazoo district for more than 30 years, did not grow at all in the years following the Promise's advent. Strazdas confided to me after the Learning Network meeting that the Promise initially put his town in a bind, and it took some effort for him and his constituents to respond constructively to it. Portage's response was to build a new high school, revamp another, build two new elementary schools, expand its International Baccalaureate programs and introduce Chinese-language instruction. Last fall, for the first time since the Promise, Portage schools enrolled more students than the year before. Other surrounding districts have also built new schools and renovated old ones. Such growth in America's northern industrial regions is a rarity.
Every day I woke up scared of what the day had to throw at me. I wasted time dodging bullets, hateful words, ignorant bullies. . . . I felt like there were no good people left in the world. But then I heard about the Kalamazoo Promise. . . . Not everyone is like you. . . . Thank you for saving my life so I can save others.
Jessica Catherine Allen, Loy Norrix High School, class of 2012
Seven classes covered by the Promise have graduated, but fewer than 500 students have received their college degrees so far. That figure reflects the difficulties students have faced in trying to complete college in four years. The first cohort of students, especially those from low-income families, has had an especially hard time finishing. It is not just that they are underprepared academically, though some are. Attending college -- free or not -- also imposes other opportunity costs, like delayed wages, that can be hard to bear.
Neither the impact of Promise financing nor the improvements in the public schools have reversed some of the most troubling conditions that confront Kalamazoo's children. The pregnancy rate for black teenagers in Kalamazoo has historically been the highest in the state. Nearly everywhere in the world where women have more educational and job opportunities, they have children at later ages. In Kalamazoo, young mothers are still a common sight in the school halls. Is it possible that the Promise, in being so generous and forgiving, makes having a baby in high school less of an impediment? Perhaps, but it's also possible that Kalamazoo would have had a high teenage-pregnancy rate no matter what. The program enables many of the mothers to press on to graduation and to college.
The most stubborn failing at Kalamazoo public schools is the high dropout rate: one-third of students do not graduate. A disproportionate number of them are black males, of whom only about 44 percent graduate. Even Kalamazoo, with the offer of free college tuition, has not figured out how to overcome the nation's so-called achievement gap, which sharply separates the academic performance, and graduation rates, of urban black males from black females and whites of both sexes. In Kalamazoo, African-American girls graduate in much higher numbers. To lift up the public schools overall, the focus must turn to African-American boys in particular, and to the challenges that keep them back.
People at the Learning Network are hoping that one possible solution might be more early-childhood education. There is an emerging consensus in economics that the biggest bang for the economic-development buck comes from investing in quality preschool education rather than higher education. The view has gained currency among education policy makers too; children who fall behind in school in early grades find later grades increasingly hard to handle. This thinking draws heavily on the work of James Heckman, an economist at the University of Chicago and a Nobel Prize winner, who stresses pushing disadvantaged children into enriched learning environments as early as possible. Dollars spent on getting very young children, even toddlers, ready to learn, the argument goes, do more to propel students through their school careers than any other spending.
It's a proposition that has influenced many in Kalamazoo. For example, Tim Bartik, an economist at the Upjohn Institute who recently served on the Kalamazoo school board, supports the Promise but maintains that early-childhood programs are needed to complement it. His book, ''Investing in Kids,'' has become a touchstone among local educators and philanthropists. It looks at the long-term economic impact of early-childhood programs on specific communities. According to his analysis, the programs raise the earnings of area residents, improve the balance sheets of local governments and elevate property values. What's more, he offers data to show that money spent on early-childhood education is likely to be spent on children who will be around as adults; more than 60 percent of Americans live in the same region they lived in at age 4.
Growing up . . . I was wondering what is this Promise, and how does it affect me? When I entered middle school, teachers were all talking about this Kalamazoo Promise. I finally started to get ahold of the concept. . . . I started to get focused on school. I wanted what everyone else had.[#x20ac]
Marcus Allen Whittaker, Loy Norrix High School, class of 2012
On a day late in the school year last May, Michael Rice made a visit to one of the district's many third-grade classes. He took over as Kalamazoo's superintendent of schools after leading a district of similar size in Clifton, N.J., and quickly devoted himself to local and statewide education issues. He lobbies in Lansing for public-school districts, whose overall allocations from the state have been cut the last two years by a newly conservative legislature. He works hard at being the face of the public schools and does things like put his picture on bookmarks for the citywide reading program. But he also operates intimately, going on rounds to meet students. His visit today completed his yearly tour of all the third-grade classes.
The students gathered on a rug while he sat in one child-size chair next to a whiteboard propped on another. ''There's just one city in the country where if you graduate from high school you get to go to college free,'' he said. ''Where?'' The kids together cried out, ''Kalamazoo!'' Rice, too, is trying to foster a college-going culture, the kind that exists in wealthier school districts. ''The Kalamazoo Promise,'' he said, '' is free for your parents, but not for you. You have to pay for it with hard work.'' He then asked if the students had learned about fractions yet. Yes, they shouted. He drew a pie chart divided into three on the whiteboard, then shaded in two of the sections. ''In Kalamazoo schools,'' he said, ''two-thirds of the students graduate and one-third drop out. Why?'' A girl in front said the dropouts are not serious; another said they cannot do the work; a boy suggested that the failing students do not go to school and tell themselves they can get to it all ''tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.''
Rice then distributed copies of Langston Hughes's poem ''Mother to Son,'' an ode to determination, and asked for a volunteer to read. A tiny girl with elaborate braids read it haltingly but bravely. Rice, smiling wide, said, ''Wow.'' He then recited the poem dramatically, by heart. ''So boy, don't you turn back./Don't you set down on the steps/'Cause you finds it's kinder hard./Don't you fall now -- '' . . .
When he finished, the students clapped wildly.

HEADLINE: A New York Promise

 BODY:
To replicate the Kalamazoo Promise in New York City, to cover the college tuition of all 52,000 students who graduate from the nation's largest school system every year, an endowment of something like $20 billion would be needed, according to Keith Luke, at the Connecticut-based Commonfund, which manages $25 billion in assets for nonprofit institutions. ''Such an endowment,'' he says, ''would provide for annual tuition payments of $5,000 for each student for four years, growing annually at the rate of inflation for higher education.'' Forbes magazine estimates that 57 billionaires live in the city. Mayor Bloomberg himself has donated more than $2.4 billion to favorite causes, and in 2013 Columbia University will finish a $5 billion fund-raising campaign, bringing in $1 billion more than its initial goal. So the money for a New York Promise is probably out there, but it would require one of the world's biggest philanthropic efforts. -- t.c.f.

THANKS, KID
By Hope Reeves
No one feels like dealing with a whiny kid covered in vomit, and the Eurasian roller bird is no exception. Not only do baby Eurasian rollers -- a k a Coracias garralus -- vomit on themselves when they sense danger, but the smell of the vomit sends their parents flying for cover. Scientists now think that the birds throw up not only to ward off predators but also to warn their doting caretakers not to return to the nest until the threat has passed. As the researcher Deseada Parejo noted, ''The parents seem to be saving their own skin.''
MY DOG MADE ME DO IT

Recently, a middle-aged man told me that walking his dog gave him a ''socially acceptable'' reason to walk. Data suggest he's not alone. A study of New Jersey households published by the University Transportation Research Center said that people who walked the most did so not because they owned fewer cars but because they owned dogs. In America, the developed country that walks the least, our dogs walk us.

I mix 2 ounces of fig schnapps (you can use slivovitz or plum brandy), 4 ounces of cranberry-juice cocktail, the juice of 1 lemon plus an ounce of Cointreau. Shake hard on ice, strain into a frosty wine glass with a couple raspberries and sip away the late afternoon.

A paper published in Atmospheric Science Letters says ''cloud seeding'' -- using wind-powered vessels to suck up tiny droplets of seawater and inject them into clouds over the ocean -- might keep the air temperature where hurricanes form low enough that hurricanes would not become as powerful. This also indirectly alters the temperature of the ocean, which may have a side benefit, too. ''We hope this will stop the heating resulting from continued fossil-fuel burning,'' John Latham, the paper's lead author, says, ''and undo some of the damage that we've caused the climate.''

JUDGE JOHN HODGMAN RULES
By John Hodgman
HARRISON WRITES: I live with my brother and his fiance, who is a veterinarian. Over the past nine months, they acquired 13 chickens, a large dog and 4 pigeons, on top of their 4 cats. I fear this will doom their marriage, so I seek an injunction against future pet acquisitions.
I must amend my previous statement on hoarding: having more pets than you can care for is not made better by putting them on a display shelf (or, as you suggest, putting them on top of four cats). But the real danger to their marriage is that you are living with them. It is time you freed yourself from their care and give them your room -- for the inevitable alpaca.

HOW TO BE CONFIDENT

Walk into your fears. After ''The Wonder Years'' ended, I began to question my self-worth. Then I went to U.C.L.A. I took a math class and actually did well in it. I felt capable for reasons that had nothing to do with the glamour of Hollywood. That was so valuable. As told to Spencer Bailey

WHO WEARS THE PANTS IN THIS ECONOMY?
These men should be thankful that their wives didn't think their marriage was a one-way street, but a partnership, and rose to the challenge to help their families. You're the lucky ones; you have a partner whom you can rely on, even if you didn't expect to. Where would you be without her? What if she left you for a better ''provider''? Be thankful for what you have. NICOLE, Alabama, posted on nytimes.com
The men portrayed have lost a huge amount of their economic and social status. Unemployment, in particular, has been shown to be one of the worst things possible for mental health and happiness, on par with serious illness or death of a family member. Just because the men portrayed are white guys from a Republican part of the country doesn't mean people should be so indifferent to their suffering. MATTHEW T. MITCHELL, Sacramento, posted on nytimes.com 
For nearly 30 years, I worked as a mechanic in various heavy industries. About 10 years ago, I quit my job servicing locomotives on the Norfolk Southern Railway, got an undergraduate degree and a paralegal certificate and haven't been out of work for more than a month or two since. At least half the supervising attorneys I've worked for are women, and I've never given it a second's thought. The work I used to do and the men I worked with for much of my adult life were a whole lot more ''macho'' than any of the three men profiled in Hanna Rosin's piece. One of her subjects, who ran an industrial floor-cleaning business, maintained that ''a man needs a strong, macho job.'' All I can say is, good luck with that job search, buddy. GLENN BALDWIN, Oakland, Calif.
Yes, manufacturing jobs are changing, and those used to be part of men's ability to succeed as the economic providers for a family -- a role often chosen by men because of societal pressures or because they enjoyed having that be a part of their identity. But I don't think this is the alternative: ''As the usual path to the middle class disappears, what's emerging in its place is a nascent middle-class matriarchy, in which women like Patsy pay the mortgage and the cable bills while the men try to find their place.'' . . . Gender is not a zero-sum game. Men do not need to be demasculinized every time a woman takes a step forward. LISA HICKEY, posted on goodmenproject.com
FEEL THE LOATHING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
Even when journalists throw the rare hardball question to a candidate, I've noticed that they almost never follow up with another hardball after the candidate ducks. Despite the work by fact-checking organizations, reporters often quote obvious lies and distortions by both sides in their ''he said, she said'' reporting. Why do journalists choose to highlight these distortions by repeating them? Why spend so much time reporting on candidates' obvious gaffes, which any human being is bound to commit from time to time, rather than attempting to represent fairly and accurately the real policy positions candidates are attempting to communicate? ELLEN HERSHEY, Albany, Calif., posted on nytimes.com
Ten minutes after I voted in 2010, I registered as an independent, the first in my family to do so. I no longer get mailings. I monitor the amount of TV blathering I watch and carefully limit how much ''analysis'' I read online. It works. I'm less affected by the invective and the moronity, and my blood pressure stays low. I no longer believe that there will be any change in the political discourse, but I've insulated myself from it while staying informed to the degree that a ''citizen'' of the country must. I highly recommend the strategy to former political and news junkies. HARRIS M. LIRTZMAN, New York, posted on nytimes.com

HEADLINE: How Not to Fire a President

BYLINE: By ANDREW RICE

 BODY:
On a languorous Sunday in June, low season on the campus of the University of Virginia, Prof. Larry Sabato opened a perplexing e-mail. ''My instant reaction,'' he said, ''was that I thought we'd been hacked.'' The message, sent to the entire university, announced the resignation of the university's president, Teresa Sullivan, obliquely citing a ''philosophical difference of opinion'' with the institution's governing board. Sullivan had held the job for just two years, without any scandal, and Sabato couldn't believe she had been pushed aside with so little evident justification. ''I said that if this was true,'' he recalled, ''this was going to be a P.R. disaster of national proportions.'' 
Sabato is accustomed to offering predictions -- a prodigiously quotable political scientist, he maintains a Web site called Sabato's Crystal Ball. And his opinions carry serious weight around UVA, an institution he has been immersed in since his undergraduate days in the 1970s, when he served as president of the Student Council. Sabato called around and discovered that the school's deans had learned of the resignation just that morning at a meeting in which Helen Dragas, the real estate developer who led UVA's board, warned that the university faced an ''existential threat.''
The professional educators who ran UVA were well aware that public universities everywhere were enduring a crisis. State governments have been slashing funding, driving per-student spending to historic lows, forcing schools to raise tuition, while controlling costs through salary freezes and other austerity measures. Founded and designed by Thomas Jefferson and renowned as one of the country's finest state institutions, the University of Virginia is better off than most of its counterparts: it fears mediocrity, not insolvency. But along with other elite public universities, it is struggling to figure out how to continue providing a premium education with less government support.
If anyone appeared equipped to manage the situation, it was Sullivan: she had come to Virginia after excelling in administrative positions at the University of Texas and the University of Michigan. ''Everybody had the same reaction,'' Sabato told me. ''First, shock, and then a sneaking suspicion that there had to be something else.'' That afternoon, in the 90-degree heat, Sabato looked on as Dragas gave an outdoor news conference. She promised to replace Sullivan with ''a bold, strategic, visionary leader'' but refused to answer when asked for the reasons behind Sullivan's departure.
Hours later, Sabato reached Dragas by phone. She justified the board's drastic action by arguing that Virginia was falling behind competitors, like Harvard and Stanford, especially in the development of online courses, a potentially transformative innovation. The conversation was agreeable, but privately, Sabato still wasn't convinced that the move was warranted. That evening, he crossed Jefferson's magnificent central lawn to join a dispirited group on the balcony of a university official's home. Sullivan was there, along with her husband, a law professor. Everyone was dumbfounded. Sullivan said she had no warning her job was in jeopardy.
Over the course of many drinks, the mood shifted from bafflement to outrage and finally to talk of rebellion. Someone raised the question: Could the board's decision be overturned? ''We went around the group,'' Sabato says, ''and every single one of us said, 'Nah, it's a done deal.' ''
On this occasion, though, Sabato's crystal ball was wrong. Over the course of the next two weeks, the slumbering college town of Charlottesville awoke in protests, as students and faculty condemned what they saw as a coup. ''This moment of terror came across everyone at UVA,'' said one professor, who underscored the point by requesting anonymity. ''If they can do it to the president, they can do it to anybody.''
Conspiracy theories abounded: that Sullivan was deposed by a Republican governor, or good ol' boy alumni, or a cabal of Wall Street donors. Vandals spray-painted the six columns of the school's neoclassical Rotunda with the letters ''G-R-E-E-E-D.'' The national news media seized onto the story, which seemed to dramatize a broader conflict between big money and public education. The conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal accused the protesting faculty of trying to create ''an academic Green Zone separated from economic reality,'' while liberal publications held up Sullivan as a symbol of a beleaguered egalitarian ideal.
Hunter Rawlings, the chief executive of the Association of American Universities, calls Sullivan's forced resignation the ''most egregious'' case of boardroom intrigue he has ever witnessed. But the situation was not unique. ''There was once a consensus in America that higher education was a public good,'' Rawlings says. ''What is new now, and radically different, is that after five, six, seven years in reductions in state funding for higher education, the whole system is under stress.'' He notes that the leaders of a dozen or so other state institutions, including those in Oregon, Wisconsin and Illinois, have recently departed under similar pressure. ''It's just one after another, after another,'' he says.
The drama at Virginia, however, was set apart by a stunning reversal. At an emotional meeting in late June, the Board of Visitors, the politically appointed body that oversees the university, bowed to criticism and reinstated Sullivan. Even then, though, Dragas refused to shed much further light on her actions. In ambiguous triumph, Sullivan was restored to her office, which is where I met her in early August, at a large table surrounded by university memorabilia and a shelf of books related to her discipline, sociology. The president wore the school's colors -- blue suit, orange blouse -- and spoke cautiously when I asked her the question that had everyone speculating all summer: Why was she pushed out?
''I don't know,'' Sullivan said, filling an awkward pause with nervous laughter, casting a glance at the university spokeswoman, Carol Wood.
''We've had that conversation around this table many times,'' Wood added. ''We don't get it.''
Virginia is a place of many stately traditions; as one faculty member joked, people there refer to ''Mr. Jefferson'' as if he had just left the room. Students are governed by a 19th-century honor code, and campus buildings are tagged with esoteric graffiti left by the school's many secret societies. These old-fashioned ideals -- honor and discretion -- contribute to the reticence surrounding Sullivan's ouster, along with more mundane issues of contractual legalities, politics and embarrassment.
For months, news organizations -- from The Washington Post to the student-run Cavalier Daily -- have been poring over records obtained through the state's Freedom of Information Act, including thousands of pages of internal e-mail correspondence. The documents reveal something of the university's state of mind in the months leading up to the crisis, as administrators feuded over budgets and discontent spread among board members. But they are, by nature, a fragmentary record: the actors were loath to put their true feelings in writing then, nor were they eager to discuss them with reporters now. Few of those directly involved were eager to talk to me, but many did speak, allowing me to piece together a fuller account of the puzzling affair. As it turns out, a ''philosophical difference'' wasn't just a euphemism: it was an apt description of a clash between two fundamentally different theories of leadership.
The first salient fact about Teresa Sullivan is that she does not look like any of the school's previous presidents, who were all men and mostly native Virginians. To a remarkable degree, they preserved the school's provincial character: it currently has around 14,000 undergraduates, 70 percent from within Virginia, and in-state tuition has remained affordable, around $12,000 a year, less than a third than that of an Ivy League school.
Yet it has been clear for years that the university faced challenges in maintaining its elite identity. When John Casteen, Sullivan's predecessor, took office in 1990, the state government provided about a quarter of the university's budget. By the time he left, 20 years later, the proportion had dwindled to less than 7 percent. Casteen addressed the gap by fund-raising, tapping a devoted alumni network to expand the school's endowment almost tenfold, to $4.6 billion, during his tenure.
Even so, it was clear that the school couldn't rely on charity to fill the budgetary gap. The recession made wealthy alumni less generous and drove down middle-class incomes, putting stress on financial-aid programs. In a farewell letter in 2010, Casteen suggested that the university might need to increase its revenues not only by raising tuition but also by expanding enrollment -- a heretical proposal at a school defined by its relatively cozy atmosphere.
Casteen was a Virginian who held three UVA degrees. Sullivan, though, was an outsider: raised in Arkansas and Mississippi and educated in the Midwest. This counted against her with some alumni, but all that mattered to faculty members was her sterling academic reputation. She was previously Michigan's provost, a prestigious No. 2 position, and before going into administration, she did pioneering sociological research at the University of Texas, co-writing books on middle-class debt with her colleagues Jay L. Westbrook and Elizabeth Warren, who has since become a liberal icon.
Sullivan was a demographer by training, a numbers cruncher. In Michigan, a state with severe fiscal woes, she dealt with constricted budgets. That experience was prominent among the factors that appealed to the search committee led by John Wynne, a retired media executive who was then rector -- UVA-speak for ''chairman'' -- of the Board of Visitors. Westbrook, still a close friend of Sullivan's, says she told him the board chose her because it wanted ''someone who could be hardheaded and put on a green eyeshade.''
Mark G. Yudof, president of the University of California system, was a mentor to Sullivan when he was chancellor at Texas, and he recognized the challenges she faced. ''Presidents are under a lot of pressure,'' he says, ''to figure out how to get more for the buck without compromising quality or riling the faculty.'' His system, which includes Berkeley and U.C.L.A., has been forced to raise tuition, increase class sizes and furlough professors. But just as vexing, he says, is a deeper uncertainty about whether the nature of the problem is situational, and thus likely to improve with the economy, or systemic.
''Some people think we've still got it right, and we just need to persevere,'' Yudof said. ''Other people say we really need a radical change in the game plan.''
Sullivan is firmly in the perseverance camp. ''I think that if you look at the higher-education landscape,'' Sullivan told me, ''generally there is a pervasive sense of crisis.'' But the way Sullivan sees it, Virginia still ranks as one of the best public universities in the country. It suffers only by comparison to the elite private schools, which can -- and do -- continually raise their tuition. That avenue is currently closed to Virginia, because state politicians have resisted tuition hikes as well as admitting a greater proportion of out-of-state students, who pay higher, nonsubsidized fees. (Outsiders, for instance, make up around 35 percent of the more than 40,000 students at the University of Michigan, and the school's president is aiming to increase the proportion.) Sullivan herself rejected the option of increasing revenue by greatly expanding the student body. ''The alumni and student body believe there is huge value in the relatively small size,'' Sullivan said. So instead, she economized and retrenched. She hired a consultant to study the university hospital's finances, nearly half of its $2.5 billion budget. As a demographer, Sullivan looked at her personnel and saw a population of baby boomers, as many as half of whom will reach retirement age by 2020. ''Technically,'' Sullivan said, ''it's a cohort succession problem.''
If she took a cautious and technocratic approach, it was because Sullivan knew the overarching issue -- deciding how to divide the shrinking pot of money -- was potentially explosive. Should the university, for instance, invest in science programs, which are capital-intensive but also draw grant money, or should it bolster its areas of strength, liberal-arts departments like English and religious studies? Virginia, like most universities, operated less like a modern corporation than a feudal state, and Sullivan could not afford to antagonize its many fiefs. ''She had the view that there were going to be winners and losers,'' said George M. Cohen, a law professor and chairman of the faculty senate. ''So she wanted to get people to understand what's going on, and at least accept the process.''
Recognizing that she had much to learn about Virginia's idiosyncratic culture, Sullivan attended countless faculty meetings, forums and sporting events. She taught a sociology seminar. But like most modern university presidents, Sullivan spent much of her time begging for money. A tiny sliver of rich alumni contributed most of the school's endowment, and UVA's fund-raising staff maintained a list of 50 ''targets'' capable of giving at least $10 million. Sullivan met 45 of them in person. The cultivation of such megadonors is a long -- sometimes lifelong -- process, and it requires more than flattery: for their money, the university's benefactors wanted a say in its future.
One of Sullivan's most promising targets was Paul Tudor Jones, a Virginia alumnus, billionaire hedge-fund manager and philanthropist. Though he had given away countless millions, Jones considered his brain to be his primary asset: he was fond of saying that ''intellectual capital will always trump financial capital.'' He had already given large sums to his alma mater, and he told Sullivan that he and his wife had an exciting new idea: endowing a center for yoga.
''I thought, Oh, man, people are going to be very cynical about this,'' recalls Bob Sweeney, UVA's fund-raising chief. So Sullivan convened a dinner at her home with professors of religion, medicine and other disciplines. ''I said, 'O.K., let us think about it a little bit,' '' she said. ''We began talking about, wait a minute, it's not just yoga.'' The group swiftly produced a proposal for a multidisciplinary Contemplative Sciences Center, which was vetted by Jones's paid yoga consultant. In April, Sullivan announced the $15 million gift, one of the largest of her tenure.
Despite this and other successes, though, Sullivan was not considered an inspirational figure. ''This is not a president,'' says one professor, ''who was hired for the vision thing.'' Unlike her predecessors, Sullivan had no talent for Jeffersonian oration; she spoke the dry language of nonprofit administration. The budgetary reform dragged, in part because Sullivan hired a provost and a chief operating officer who couldn't get along. Despite meeting after meeting, it was unclear whether Sullivan's process was leading to a resolution. Sullivan has called herself an ''incrementalist,'' but even some supporters wondered whether her talk of consensus masked a deeper dysfunction.
''You get the buy-in from stakeholders before you move forward,'' Sullivan says in her defense. ''When I came here, I was warned that this was an institution steeped in tradition. People love the tradition, and they would not react well to sudden change.''
A higher authority, though, was beginning to lose patience.
The Board of Visitors is an archaic body, a vestige of Jefferson's original conception of his university as an ''academical village,'' governing itself without executive authority. It was not until the early 20th century that the university bowed to practicality and hired a president. Though the board's influence over the school has waned since then, a seat on it remains one of the most prestigious gifts a governor can bestow on a Virginian. Democrats and Republicans alike tend to allot the seats to major campaign contributors.
The board that was judging Sullivan's performance included lawyers, developers, a coal-mining executive and a beer distributor, but no voting member had an education background. Because of rapid turnover in the wake of the election of Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, it included only four members of the search committee that picked Sullivan two years before. One of them was Helen Dragas, but she seemed less than enthusiastic about the choice. ''Helen's comments indicated that she somehow had it in her mind that Terry was more of an administrator than a leader,'' says Austin Ligon, a businessman who was on the search committee.
''I gave her my vote of confidence at her election, and worked diligently to support both her presidency and the mission of the institution,'' Dragas told me by phone in late August. ''There just came a time when the two objectives seemed contradictory, and I acted in the best interests of the students.'' Sharp-featured and intense, Dragas holds a bachelor's degree and an M.B.A. from UVA. Her own business experience is in the Virginia Beach real estate firm founded by her father, George, a hard-driving child of Greek immigrants. By all accounts, Dragas inherited much from her father, who himself headed the board of a university, Old Dominion, some two decades earlier. ''If a president can't do it,'' he once said, ''we either have to work with him -- or replace him.''
Helen Dragas saw her father put that blunt philosophy to work, when he hired James Koch as Old Dominion's president. ''I followed an individual who was fired using very much the same model that occurred at UVA,'' Koch, who is now retired, told me. Koch went on to a successful tenure, becoming a national authority on presidential leadership, and he says he discussed the dispute over Sullivan's resignation with several UVA board members, including Dragas. ''They looked around and they said, 'There's a revolution going on in higher education,' '' Koch says. ''They thought that the people in Charlottesville were not responding.''
What had the board so worried? In late May, as she prepared to remove Sullivan, Dragas e-mailed a board colleague a link to a Wall Street Journal column, beneath the subject line: ''Why we can't afford to wait.'' The article described a joint venture that offers free, open online courses. In the last year, Harvard, Stanford, M.I.T. and other elite schools have moved aggressively into this arena, drawing significant global audiences, if no actual revenue. While many veteran professors roll their eyes at predictions that online learning will transform the structure of universities, to certain segments of the donor community -- the Wall Street and Aspen Institute types -- higher education looks like another hidebound industry awaiting creative destruction. ''If you're not talking about it,'' says Jeffrey Walker, a UVA fund-raiser and a former JPMorgan financier, ''what's wrong with you?''
This discussion has been influenced by the ideas of Clayton M. Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor and guru of ''disruptive innovation,'' the concept that established companies are often overtaken by upstart competitors because they are incapable of embracing new technologies. In his book ''The Innovative University,'' Christensen argues that higher education could go the way of America's steel industry. Dragas told me she found Christensen's ideas extremely compelling.
''Higher education is one of the last sectors of the economy to undergo this kind of systemic restructuring,'' Dragas says. She and other board members emphasized, however, that online education was merely a proxy for a deeper concern about the pace of change in higher education. Dragas was equally worried about the hospital, which was competing for market share and facing changes in financing, and a decline in federal research funding. Some board members wanted Sullivan to reallocate resources from marginal to core needs, and while they weren't sure how to achieve that shift, they wanted to hear exciting ideas from the president. Sullivan didn't seem to be willing -- or perhaps able -- to provide them. Sullivan contends she was given contradictory instructions by Wynne, the rector who hired her, and later by Dragas. Was she supposed to be implementing the many plans the university had devised over the years, or coming up with new ones? Sullivan worked to strengthen her strategic thinking with a pair of business professors, but her dutiful efforts left some board members unimpressed. ''She seemed, in a word, plodding,'' R. J. Kirk, a pharmaceutical billionaire and board member, told me.
Some of Sullivan's allies suggest, discreetly, that she didn't fit the board's image of a chief executive. She is in her 60s and has the fashion sense of an academic. In a personnel review process last year, Dragas, who is immaculately tailored, told Sullivan that she received comments from several board colleagues, questioning whether her wardrobe was occasionally too informal.
''I don't know what the unprofessional dress was,'' Sullivan said. ''I do live here at the university, so when I'm working out or doing something else here, people will see me.'' It's hard to imagine anyone leveling such criticism at, say, the famously rumpled former Harvard president Larry Summers. ''People are very much aware that I'm the first woman president of Virginia,'' she said. ''It would be nave to think it's not there as an issue.'' Dragas calls the suggestion that she judged Sullivan by her appearance ''ridiculous,'' adding, ''If the president had been a man, I would have conveyed the same sentiments from the board, no question about it.''
Sullivan declined to discuss her relationship with Dragas, other than to say that she felt it was ''cordial, respectful,'' until the moment it fell apart. The president was at times visibly frustrated in her interactions with the board. To a degree that administrators find remarkable, Dragas and other board members intervened in UVA's day-to-day management, questioning everything from the cost of historic building renovations to the offering of a course entitled ''GaGa for Gaga: Sex, Gender and Identity.''
Sometime last fall, Dragas asked Sullivan to prepare a written strategy for the university. ''I'm growing increasingly nervous that others are thinking about big trends and long- term prospects for higher education delivery and funding,'' Dragas wrote in April to the vice rector, Mark Kington, a hedge-fund manager. Sullivan's response was disappointing. Brief and written in a transparently grudging tone, Sullivan's memo warned that ''we are not as excellent as our rankings imply'' but offered little in the way of a coherent approach to the university's problems.
In mid-May, Dragas received a warning from yet another quarter -- a letter signed by about 450 faculty members. It complained that, after years without raises, Virginia's faculty salaries -- around $141,000 for full professors -- were lagging far behind competitors'. ''What was once worry about getting through economic hard times is now crystallizing into hopelessness, cynicism, resentment and anger,'' the letter stated, demanding ''urgent and immediate action.'' Dragas says the letter read ''like a desperate reach around the administration, and a cry to the board for help, and also a concrete plan.''
It was around this time that she began gathering support for Sullivan's ouster. Virginia law requires any meeting of more than two board members to be publicly announced. Dragas lobbied board members in one-on-one phone calls, a tactic that critics suggest she used to avoid scrutiny. She also briefed Governor McDonnell. (The governor's office declined to make him available for an interview.) While many, including McDonnell, have since denied participation in the decision, at the time they said nothing that dissuaded Dragas from acting. The rector says she won the backing from 15 of the board's 16 members.
In her back-channel conversations, Dragas also approached some key donors and alumni, including Paul Tudor Jones. Dragas told Jones that UVA needed strategic thinking, and she discussed a position for him advising the board. She disclosed that Sullivan might be on her way out, and Jones -- who had some leverage as the donor of Sullivan's largest gift -- raised no objection. After thinking about the board position for a week, though, Jones decided he had too many other philanthropic commitments and recommended his neighbor in Greenwich, Conn., Peter Kiernan.
''I knew, but I wasn't involved,'' Kiernan told me recently. A silver haired ex-Goldman Sachs banker and a fund-raiser for UVA's business school, he suggested to Dragas that he could help the university in devising big-picture priorities, its ''20-, 30-, 40-year bets.'' They discussed raising hundreds of millions of dollars for faculty salaries. ''Mission first,'' Kiernan told me. ''That's the way strategic planning ought to be.''
Kiernan said it was ''absurd'' to suggest, as some protesters later did, that Sullivan's removal was a Wall Street conspiracy. ''This notion that one or two or three donors could get together and topple a president,'' he said, ''forget whether it's possible; it's not even smart.'' But some Sullivan supporters see a more subtle chain of causality. Ligon, a former board member and a successful entrepreneur himself -- he was a founder of CarMax, a used-car chain -- said he thought the board members had fallen under the influence of high-finance mentality. ''Private-equity and hedge-fund guys typically come into a situation of mediocrity, where rapid change may result in a profit,'' he told me. ''When you're talking about a well-established university with a strong reputation that is trying to enhance that reputation, that's not how the game is played.''
Sullivan's opponents on the board, by contrast, saw themselves in a courageous light. ''The easiest thing for us to do as a board would have been to punt,'' Kington told me. ''It's a larger issue that we're dealing with as a society: Do you advance into the field and meet challenges, or wait for them to find you?'' They looked at Sullivan, with her talk of ''buy-in'' and ''stakeholders,'' and saw a bureaucrat captive to an entrenched faculty.
On June 5, Dragas e-mailed her colleagues a ''timely article,'' the text of a graduation address on ''failure and rescue'' by the physician and writer Atul Gawande. Several replied with praise for Dragas's leadership. Kirk wrote, ''The time in which we could be deferential toward an administration that is mostly bent on the preservation of the status quo is at an end.''
''Thanks for your encouragement,'' Dragas wrote back. ''I expect to be bullet-ridden by Sunday.''
Dragas appears to have presumed that opposition would be fleeting. On June 8, she and Kington arrived on campus for a meeting with Sullivan and asked for her resignation, offering a generous settlement package. Sullivan agonized for a day, signed the papers, and the announcement was issued. Dragas began the process of looking for a new president. ''We want this to be a liberating process,'' she wrote John Simon, the university provost, the day after the resignation was announced, ''so that you can act decisively on academic matters.''
The university, however, declined to greet Sullivan's enemies as liberators. In response to an initial fusillade of criticism, Dragas brought up the letter on faculty pay, raising the prospect of increased salaries once the university recruited ''a stellar new president.'' Paul Tudor Jones jumped into the fray, writing a column for a Charlottesville newspaper in which he called Sullivan's departure ''a clarion call from the Board of Visitors that business as usual is not acceptable anymore. Why be good when there is outstanding to be had?''
Dragas, though, had badly misjudged the faculty. While they love to complain about their salaries, academics typically place a higher value on less quantifiable benefits, like academic freedom and the job security of the tenure system. Though they harbored no great love for Sullivan, she was still one of their own. When a financier like Jones urged them to be ''elated'' about the change, it only fed paranoia about the creeping influence of wealthy donors. Shortly after Sullivan's removal, Peter Kiernan sent a mass e-mail disclosing that he had been consulted ahead of time and assuring the university that Dragas and Kington -- both business-school alums -- would be proceeding ''with a focus on strategic dynamism.''
''I think that was the catalyst for real outrage,'' Robert Fatton, a comparative government professor, says of Kiernan's e-mail. On June 18, Sullivan gave what was intended as a farewell speech to the board, criticizing ''corporate-style, top-down leadership'' as a crowd of thousands gathered on the lawn to protest.
''This board comes predominantly from the corporate sector, and they were not used to dealing with people who have academic tenure and can say whatever they want,'' James Koch told me. ''They are used to being able to fire people who do that.''
Sullivan's supporters established a ''war room'' on campus, where they organized a counterattack, focusing on influential alumni and wavering board members. The key mobilizer was Wynne, the rector who hired Sullivan. Though he no longer held any office, he still had deep connections within the university and in Virginia politics and media. ''I was unaware that when he gave me the key to the Rotunda, he kept a figurative duplicate for himself,'' says Dragas, who says she saw herself as the target of a group led by Wynne that was resistant to her attempts to address the university's long-term challenges. ''It mutated into a real struggle over who controlled the university.'' (Wynne declined to comment.)
Dragas's actions suggest that she originally saw the resistance as a public-relations problem. After the resignation, the board retained a high-priced communications firm to handle damage control, but Dragas issued only vague statements. The Washington Post, citing anonymous sources, reported that the board thought Sullivan ''lacked the mettle'' to make difficult cuts, like the elimination of the classics and German departments. Sullivan told me no such actions were ever discussed, but the story further fired up her supporters.
Governor McDonnell was on a trade mission to Europe at the time of Sullivan's ouster, which allowed him to distance himself, but as the turmoil went on, he called on the board to resolve the issue or resign en masse. By this time, many of Dragas's allies had deserted her. Sullivan was reinstated by a unanimous vote on June 26 and appeared on the steps of the Rotunda to address cheering supporters with an obligatory quote from Jefferson: ''It is pleasant for those who have just escaped threatened shipwreck to hail one another when landed in unexpected safety.''
In the weeks since, Dragas and Sullivan issued a joint statement declaring themselves ''unequivocally united in the belief that the institution's future is brighter than ever,'' but their reconciliation has been chilly at best. Sullivan's partisans have advanced plenty of theories about hidden motivations behind her ouster, like Republican suspicion of the university's climate-science program. But in recent weeks, many of them have begun to consider the possibility that there was actually no vast conspiracy, just a small circle of meddlers with a nave faith in the capacities of heroic leadership. ''No one wants to believe,'' the media-studies professor Siva Vaidhyanathan says, ''that Dragas was both sincere and incompetent.''
At the height of the outcry, Dragas was flooded with angry e-mail -- ''Resign witch!'' read one message -- and she contemplated stepping down. But she held on, and Governor McDonnell recently shocked many by reappointing her to another four years on the board, though she will serve less than one more year as rector. ''I am a very tenacious person,'' Dragas told me. ''Mr. Jefferson said it best: 'In matters of style, swim with the current. In matters of principle, stand like a rock.' ''
Though Dragas has given perfunctory apologies to Sullivan, she has told others that she feels her warnings of an existential crisis will be vindicated. The president is just as unwavering in her convictions. ''Being an incrementalist,'' Sullivan declared in June, ''does not mean that I lack vision.'' Though she is proceeding with online courses -- soon after her reinstatement, the university announced a partnership with Coursera, a for-profit online initiative -- she is doing it her way: deliberately. ''I think it is important to emphasize,'' she told me, ''that they are experiments.'' When I asked Sullivan how she intended to handle her relationship with Dragas and the board, she responded with just one word: ''Carefully.''
In mid-August, Sullivan met her chastened opponents for the first time since her reinstatement, at an annual board retreat in Richmond. Terry MacTaggart, a retired university chancellor, was brought in to act as a sort of marriage counselor, conducting seminars on communication. ''Let me just acknowledge one thing,'' MacTaggart said. ''This is an awkward environment.'' MacTaggart's efforts were hampered by the presence of reporters and news cameras. Dragas spoke rarely, her face fixed in a thoughtful rictus, as MacTaggart scribbled bullet points on an easel.
After Sullivan's reinstatement, Dragas complimented her on the speeches she gave during the crisis -- Sullivan was a leader, after all -- and many board members expressed the hope that the president had emerged in a strong-enough position to tackle contentious issues like tying faculty compensation to performance. Unintentionally, the board transformed Sullivan into the thing it coveted all along: a national star. Larry Sabato, who has pictures of the protests in his living room, says, ''She has the potential to be a transformational figure if she chooses -- and the board lets her.''
For now, at least publicly, no one is standing in her way. On the second day of the retreat, Sullivan gave a confident speech outlining her agenda for the university. ''We are not in any financial crisis,'' she said, in implicit rebuke, making note of the school's pristine bond rating. She discussed the budget, tuition increases, costs at the hospital, the shaky future of federal aid and Coursera. ''We have the opportunity,'' Sullivan told the board, ''to combine the best of a liberal-arts college with the resources of a research university.'' When the president was finished, Dragas called for questions. None of the board members ventured to open their mouths.

HEADLINE: Don't Show Me the Money!

BYLINE: By JAMES ATLAS. 
The author of ''My Life in the Middle Ages: A Survivor's Tale.''

 BODY:
THESPIAN friends perform ''The Seagull'' in their garden. Only minutes into the first act, a lovely young woman named Masha, sick of hearing the lovesick schoolteacher Medvedenko whine about his penury, blurts out, ''All you ever do is talk and talk about money.'' That's when it dawns on me: I'm sick of the subject, too. For the rest of Act I, I find myself ruminating about the glut of financial data that daily clogs the news: Libor and MF Global Holdings; HSBC's money-laundering of Mexican drug-cartel money; ''the London Whale'' whose huge trades cost J.P. Morgan Chase billions; leveraged buyouts and mortgage-backed securities and derivatives and stimulus packages, Bain Capital and the tottering euro and the Greek bailout. Saul Bellow referred to this quotidian fretting about world affairs as ''crisis chatter.'' Today's crises are all about what is euphemistically called ''the financial services industry'' -- that is to say, they're all about money. 
Call it Wall Street porn. Not only do we know more than most of us wish to know about how the rich live -- we even know, thanks to the deep-digging efforts of the business reporters over at Bloomberg, how much they have. But there is such a thing as knowing too much: Did Larry Ellison buy a Hawaiian island for $600 million? And did that include the hotels? Is George Soros's net worth $18 billion? $20 billion? (Anyway, why begrudge him? He's probably given half of it away.) And when we talk about the 99 percent who aren't rich, shouldn't that leave just 1 percent who are? Then why are we always hearing about the 0.1 percent and the .01 percent? Valiant fact-checkers are off the hook on this one: my point is that the exact numbers don't matter.
We're all aware of the vast and still growing gap between the very rich and everyone else, we all know the global economy is a mess. But do we have to hear about it every waking minute of every day? We're in trouble when the earnestly liberal NPR begins its morning broadcast with a program called ''Planet Money.''
I can't even go for a bike ride without being reminded that we all share it now. My admirable neighbor Nathan, who makes a living doing odd jobs and is a militant nonparticipant in the global economy, has staked a cardboard poster on his lawn that reads, in blue letters, We are the 99 percent.
Why is it that the richer the rich get, the more their doings preoccupy the rest of us? What happened to the tacit social prohibition against talking about money? In part, it's the fault of the media (as usual). ''Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out'': King Lear's shrewd assessment of the human tendency to keep score is especially suited to our own historical moment, when everything is done in public. I didn't ask for a peek at Warren Buffett's portfolio: in order not to know how much preferred stock he acquired in Goldman Sachs I would have to confine my periodical reading to National Geographic.
The problem is: I need to know about money. Like most everyone else in the middle class, I'm scared. Reverberations from the largely bank-induced financial debacle of 2008 still ripple outward, lapping at our retirement plans and hard-earned savings. It never occurred to me that I would have to learn about I-bonds and TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) at an age when I would have thought I was finally safe from the tortures of high school math -- worse, would have to learn higher math just to avoid getting swallowed by the London Whale and his pod. I would love to catch up on the first four seasons of ''Breaking Bad''; instead I sit up late at night with a calculator trying to figure out if I have enough for retirement.
In his ominously titled book, ''Are We Rome?'' Cullen Murphy noted that the senatorial aristocracy of the ancient world -- ''by one estimate two thousandths of one percent of the population'' -- was fine with a lopsided household income. ''The very tiny Roman elite accepted the chasm between themselves and everyone else as the divinely ordained natural order and an affirmation of their own virtue.'' I suspect that few in our own tiny elite feel that way. ''Most Americans don't want our society to be like this, and we remain at heart a middle-class nation,'' Mr. Murphy suggests.
So why don't we do something about it -- close a few tax loopholes, regulate the banks -- instead of gazing at the glossy real estate brochures that come in the mail? Is it possible that our fascination with the rich reflects some flaw in the nation's value structure that cuts across class lines? Does subscribing to Architectural Digest make us unwittingly collusive in the perpetuation of wealth inequity? Is the middle class enabling the upper class?
None of this has been lost on the great Keynes biographer Robert Skidelsky, whose new book, ''How Much is Enough?: Money and the Good Life,'' co-written with his son Edward, identifies an ''ethic of acquisitiveness'' in the air. To explain this trend, the Skidelskys invoke the phenomenon of what sociologists refer to as ''bandwagon goods'' -- ''goods that are desired because others already have them.'' This insatiable, competition-fueled appetite for stuff we don't need shackles us to ''continuous, objectless wealth-creation -- something that did not exist in earlier times, and that remains, in some sense, peculiar to capitalism.''
As I read their book, I was reminded of ''The Gift,'' Lewis Hyde's classic study of exchange systems in so-called ''primitive'' cultures. Published in 1983, this haunting anthropological elegy to lost civilizations was prescient. Mr. Hyde made the case that advanced capitalist nations, blinded by ''market triumphalism,'' had lost any sense of the rituals and beliefs that once defined us as a society, the institutions that bound us together: ''We've witnessed the steady conversion into private property of the art and ideas that earlier generations thought belonged to their cultural commons, and we've seen the commodification of things that a few years ago would have seemed beyond the reach of any market.'' We now inhabited a world in which everything was for sale.
Nearly three decades later, Michael Sandel, a professor of government at Harvard, has confirmed Mr. Hyde's premonitions in his new book, ''What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets.'' Mr. Sandel's argument is that in our zeal for growth we have ''monetized'' goods and services -- education, medical care, access to national parks, clean air, even the right to immigrate -- once available free. We've made the country itself a corporation. (In a recent speech, Mitt Romney, apparently referring to the United States, promised ''to make sure this company deals with its challenges.'')
''The most fateful change that unfolded during the past three decades was not an increase in greed,'' Mr. Sandel observes. ''It was the expansion of markets, and of market values, into spheres of life where they don't belong.'' Gone is the time when art was appreciated as art, not as an investment; when a nest egg was for security, not to be shown off like a Faberg; when politics was about issues, not war chests. The idea of producing something for fun or pleasure or the creation of beauty has become obsolete.
In a society in which money is the measure of all things, it becomes hard to assess your achievements in other terms. The breakdown of community -- of church and neighborhood and work that provides a firm identify -- has forced us to find alternative ways of determining our place in the social order. It makes no more sense to ask the derivatives salesman to monitor himself, to pull back from the pursuit of maximum profit, than to ask A-Rod to go easy on the home runs. It's their job; it's what they do.
The same week that I saw ''The Seagull,'' I attended a performance of ''The Magic Flute'' in a small, 19th-century town hall that seated 90 (and, I'm glad to say, was filled to capacity). Tickets were $30. I've seen Mozart's joyous opera many times, and this was the best by far. The singers were superb; the mini-orchestra played with gusto; the makeshift costumes were touchingly inventive. How did the cast members get paid? Or did they? The production was instructive: there was a soprano from a local conservatory, an itinerant freelance tenor, a baritone working toward his M.A. in musicology. Some of the staff worked pro bono (as did the actors in our local production of ''The Seagull,'' who donated two weeks of their summer vacation in return for free meals and a sojourn in the country). It was an exhilarating event. You couldn't monetize it; you couldn't commodify it; you couldn't load it up on your bandwagon of goods. You could only experience it.
Money is a kind of poetry, declared Wallace Stevens, who worked for a Hartford insurance company and knew what he was talking about. But isn't it also true that poetry is a kind of money?

HEADLINE: Two New Heavyweights in the Midsize Ring: Altima: Sailing Into the Mainstream

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
WHEN Nissan unveiled a new Altima for 2002, it heralded the company's redesign as much as the car's. Nissan's workaholic new leader, Carlos Ghosn, was engineering a remarkably fast turnaround that made him a global auto-industry superstar. And the great-looking Altima -- formerly an obscure runt among family sedans -- was the model that, more than any other, transformed Nissan from a debt-ridden basket case into one of the most profitable automakers.
A car like that is a tough act to follow, but the Altima continues to expand its presence. Last year, the American-made sedan quietly passed the Honda Accord to become America's second-best-selling passenger car, trailing only the Toyota Camry.
That evolved status -- from sporty underdog to established contender -- seems reflected in the all-new 2013 model. Nissan is no longer looking to stake a claim, but to hold the high ground against hungry upstarts like the Hyundai Sonata, not to mention an impressively redesigned Accord. 
About the only bad thing I'll say about the Altima is that the redesign plays it very safe; it's a collection of the clichs of the current midsize class. If I were an Infiniti executive, I'd be fed up with the way Nissan keeps stealing every design cue that's not nailed down. Infiniti has had a hard enough time forging a luxury identity and convincing people it's worth the extra cash, without the mainstream parent constantly nosing through its design diary.
But in this always-conservative segment of the market, the conservative impulse is easy to forgive. With some 2.5 million annual sales, midsize sedans remain America's most popular type of car. Tally up the times that showroom doors are open, and nearly 8,100 Americans buy a midsize sedan every day.
Like many auto writers, I've been known to fawn over those rare family cars with a sporty edge, including that 2002 Altima or the original Mazda 6. But most of those 8,100 daily buyers are focused on comfort, reliability, features, safety and other family attributes. Styling helps, but ''sportiness'' is well down that list, if it appears at all.
The point is that this Altima, while it drives beautifully, feels less like a sport sedan than ever. You can thank, or blame, a pair of modern fuel savers: the electrically assisted power steering, which tends to filter out some useful sensations from the road, and the continuously variable automatic transmission, a technology that may also be described as a prophylactic against fun.
Boy-racer gripes aside, here's the good part: this Altima is a terrific family car, among the best in the current field. That's saying something, considering the depth and now the multinational breadth of that field. Aside from the Japanese labels (Altima, Accord and Camry) and the Koreans (the Sonata and Kia Optima), the Americans (Ford Fusion and Chevrolet Malibu) are playing to win and the German-bred, American-built Volkswagen Passat is posting solid sales gains.
For 2013, Nissan will also continue to sell the existing Altima coupe, based on the previous-generation sedan.
With its two-engine strategy -- Hyundai, Chevy and Ford are among the rivals that have dropped V-6s from their midsize models -- the Altima may rope in buyers with varying values. The Altima's 182-horsepower 4-cylinder version tops its class with an impressive federal rating of 27 miles per gallon in town and 38 on the highway. Move up to the 270-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6, and the Altima will scoot from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 6.2 seconds, quicker than most competitors and right on top of the powerful new Accord V-6.
The Nissan 6-cylinder also posts a respectable 22/31 m.p.g. rating.
Altima engineers have evidently been sitting with the cool kids in the Infiniti lunchroom, because the car's refinement and quiet seems more in keeping with a model from Nissan's luxury brand. Again, some features come straight from Infiniti, including a useful four-inch color display, nestled between exceptionally legible round gauges, that shows navigation information, tire pressures, blind-spot warnings and Pandora audio displays.
Nissan, usually so fond of interior gimmickry, plays this one mercifully straight, with a sensible touch screen and clear attention to fit-and-finish rather than ephemeral design trends.
For the most part, the clever bits are actually clever, including one that eliminates the need for a tire gauge: the Easy-Fill Tire Alert honks the horn when the tires reach the recommended pressure. Most Altimas have a factory-installed remote start function, handy for preheating or cooling the cabin.
Nissan says design inspiration for the front seats came from NASA research on a stress-free posture in zero gravity, aiming to relieve pressure on sensitive, load-bearing areas -- including the lower back, thighs and backside. That may sound a bit spacey, but the Altima's seats remained comfortable during an all-day drive followed by a brutal 90-minute homecoming through Manhattan. But the fabric itself could stand some anti-gravity coating: The cushy, nubby fabric is a magnet for dust, hair and detritus. (Perforated leather seats and trim are optional.)
The Altima does have the science of smooth performance down pat, including a solid structure, a nifty front suspension design and 30 percent more sound absorption material inside. The Nissan grows 0.8 inch longer and 1.3 inches wider, and the 15.4 cubic foot trunk is vacation-ready, yet the Altima -- despite many more features -- is the lightest car in its class, some 80 pounds slimmer than the previous version. Four-cylinder models average a slender 3,140 pounds, or 3,325 for V-6 models.
Nissan claims a first in its class with Active Understeer Control, which can subtly apply a brake to the front wheel on the inside of a turn, if the car enters the curve too quickly. That brake application helps nudge the car back onto the intended course. Options include Lane Departure Warning and Moving Object Detection, the latter flashing a warning if a car or pedestrian strays behind the car while it's backing up.
Rather than the stepped gears of a typical automatic, the continuously variable transmission uses a belt and pulleys to infinitely vary gear ratios. While I'm no fan of C.V.T.'s, which can rev the engine obtrusively and take the driver out of the equation, Nissan's steady work on this technology is paying dividends; the Altima's C.V.T. is smoother and smarter than most.
Nissan cites 70 percent new components in its latest C.V.T., a 40 percent friction reduction and the widest gear-ratio spread of any midsize sedan, a double-whammy boon to acceleration and fuel economy.
As part of the secret to its class-best economy, at 60 m.p.h. the 4-cylinder engine is turning at a mere 1,450 r.p.m.
The V-6 model I tested featured shift paddles behind the steering wheel. Those enormous paddles, unfortunately, are just a tease, akin to slapping a Ferrari badge on a minivan: even in the transmission's Sport mode, which tries to give the driver more control over engine speeds, the transmission largely works according to its own logic.
That said, the C.V.T. puts power to the pavement in efficient fashion. My hunch is that if you lay on the gas, the V-6 will run with anything in its class.
The car may not be overtly sporty, but Nissan's claim to have benchmarked BMW, Audi and Mercedes sedans seems reasonable when you go for a spin: the car feels smooth, sophisticated and utterly controlled even at speeds few families will experience.
Where some competitors are so confident in their four-bangers that they've dropped their V-6s, the Altima soldiers on with a 3.5-liter 6. This engine, good enough to be the workhorse of Infiniti models that cost up to $50,000, again reminded me that there's a lot to be said for a powerful V-6 in a family car.
The Nissan 3.5 delivers quieter, more linear power than rivals' turbo 4-cylinders, and it's quicker, too. V-6 versions start at $26,140 for the 3.5S. The top-dog Altima 3.5SL maxes out at $31,950 with the optional ($1,090) Technology Package. The 4-cylinder Altima starts at $22,280 and peaks just below $30,000 for the 2.5SL with the Technology Package, which adds touch-screen navigation, Google's point-of-interest search and a send-to-car navigation function, along with blind-spot, lane-departure and moving-object monitors.
To Nissan's eternal credit, buyers can opt for an especially affordable stand-alone navigation system, minus the additional safety monitors. That system, which includes the Google functions, costs just $590 -- a trend to watch as automakers realize they must compete in price with portable and phone-based navigation units.
One caveat is that the Nissan will face, in addition to the new Accord, a pair of robust and handsome challengers this year in the redesigned 2013 Mazda 6 and Ford Fusion, the latter offering hybrid and plug-in versions that will soar past 40 m.p.g.
Chants of ''We're No. 2!'' may seem pathetic in a sports arena. But with so many worthy midsize sedans fighting for the loyalties of millions of Americans, finishing second in sales to the Toyota Camry is a genuine accomplishment. This Altima seems eminently trained and equipped to hang onto that silver medal, a profitable position that would have Nissan leading the cheers.

HEADLINE: Do Tax Cuts Lead to Economic Growth?

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Washington
FOR one of my occasional conversations with Representative Paul D. Ryan over the last few years, I brought a chart. The chart showed economic growth in the United States in the last several decades, and I handed Mr. Ryan a copy as we sat down in his Capitol Hill office. A self-professed economics wonk, he immediately laughed, in what seemed an appropriate mix of appreciation and teasing.
One of the first things you notice in the chart is that the American economy was not especially healthy even before the financial crisis began in late 2007. By 2007, remarkably, the economy was already on pace for its slowest decade of growth since World War II. The mediocre economic growth, in turn, brought mediocre job and income growth -- and the crisis more than erased those gains.
The defining economic policy of the last decade, of course, was the Bush tax cuts. President George W. Bush and Congress, including Mr. Ryan, passed a large tax cut in 2001, sped up its implementation in 2003 and predicted that prosperity would follow. 
The economic growth that actually followed -- indeed, the whole history of the last 20 years -- offers one of the most serious challenges to modern conservatism. Bill Clinton and the elder George Bush both raised taxes in the early 1990s, and conservatives predicted disaster. Instead, the economy boomed, and incomes grew at their fastest pace since the 1960s. Then came the younger Mr. Bush, the tax cuts, the disappointing expansion and the worst downturn since the Depression.
Today, Mitt Romney and Mr. Ryan are promising another cut in tax rates and again predicting that good times will follow. But it's not the easiest case to make. Much as President Obama should be asked to grapple with the economy's disappointing recent performance (a subject for a planned column), Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan would do voters a service by explaining why a cut in tax rates would work better this time than last time.
That was precisely the question I was asking Mr. Ryan when I brought him the chart last year. He wasn't the vice presidential nominee then, but his budget plan has a lot in common with Mr. Romney's.
''I wouldn't say that correlation is causation,'' Mr. Ryan replied. ''I would say Clinton had the tech-productivity boom, which was enormous. Trade barriers were going down in the Clinton years. He had the peace dividend he was enjoying.''
The economy in the Bush years, by contrast, had to cope with the popping of the technology bubble, 9/11, a couple of wars and the financial meltdown, Mr. Ryan continued. ''Some of this is just the timing, not the person,'' he said.
He then made an analogy. ''Just as the Keynesians say the economy would have been worse without the stimulus'' that Mr. Obama signed, Mr. Ryan said, ''the flip side is true from our perspective.'' Without the Bush tax cuts, that is, the worst economic decade since World War II would have been even worse.
Since that conversation, I have asked the same question of conservative economists and received similar answers. ''To me, the Bush tax cuts get too much attention,'' said R. Glenn Hubbard, who helped design them as the chairman of Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and is now a Romney adviser. ''The pro-growth elements of the tax cuts were fairly modest in size,'' he added, because they also included politically minded cuts like the child tax credit. Phillip L. Swagel, another former Bush aide, said that even a tax cut as large as Mr. Bush's ''doesn't translate quickly into higher growth.''
Why not? The main economic argument for tax cuts is simple enough. In the short term, they put money in people's pockets. Longer term, people will presumably work harder if they keep more of the next dollar they earn. They will work more hours or expand their small business. This argument dominates the political debate.
But tax cuts have other effects that receive less attention -- and that can slow economic growth. Somebody who cares about hitting a specific income target, like $1 million, might work less hard after receiving a tax cut. And all else equal, tax cuts increase the deficit, as Mr. Bush's did, which creates other economic problems.
When the top marginal rate was 70 percent or higher, as it was from 1940 to 1980, tax cuts really could make a big difference, notes Donald Marron, director of the highly regarded Tax Policy Center and another former Bush administration official. When the top rate is 35 percent, as it is today, a tax cut packs much less economic punch.
''At the level of taxes we've been at the last couple decades and the magnitude of the changes we've had, it's hard to make the argument that tax rates have a big effect on economic growth,'' Mr. Marron said. Similarly, a new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found that, over the past 65 years, changes in the top tax rate ''do not appear correlated with economic growth.''
Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan, to be sure, are not calling for a simple repeat of the Bush tax cuts. They say they favor a complete overhaul of the tax code, reducing tax rates by one-fifth (taking the top rate down to 28 percent) and shrinking various tax breaks. Many economists think such an overhaul could do more good than the Bush tax cuts, by simplifying the tax code.
The problem for anyone trying to evaluate the Romney plan, however, is that there isn't a full plan yet. He will not say which tax breaks he would reduce, and the large ones, like the mortgage-interest deduction, are all popular. In a painstaking analysis, the Tax Policy Center showed that achieving all of Mr. Romney's top-line goals -- a revenue-neutral overhaul that does not increase the tax burden of the middle class -- is not arithmetically possible. History is littered with vague calls for tax reform that went nowhere.
Beyond taxes, Mr. Romney has declined to detail what spending cuts he would make, although he has promised to make big ones. And some of the programs that would be at risk -- medical research, education, technology, roads, mass transportation -- probably have a better historical claim on lifting economic growth than tax cuts do.
The policies that new presidents pass tend to be ones on which they laid out specifics, be they the Bush and Reagan tax cuts or the Obama health overhaul. Based on the specifics, Mr. Romney puts a higher priority on tax cuts than anything else. Yet the reality of the last two decades has caused conservative economists, and Mr. Ryan himself, to acknowledge the limits of tax cuts.
In one of our conversations, Mr. Ryan told me that the single most important objective of any economic plan had to be raising growth. ''We have to figure out how best to grow the pie so it helps everyone,'' he said.
It is certainly true that strong economic growth helps solve almost every challenge the country faces: the deficit, unemployment, the income slump, even the rise of China. It is also true that some liberals put too much emphasis on the distribution of the pie and not enough on the size.
But when you dig into Mr. Romney's and Mr. Ryan's proposals and you consider recent history, the fairest thing to say is that, so far at least, they have laid out a plan to cut taxes. They have not yet explained why and how it is also an economic-growth plan.

HEADLINE: In Dueling Ads, Candidates Seek to Politicize Issues of China and Manufacturing

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
United States-China relations continue to surface as an issue on the campaign trail, particularly in battleground states like Ohio where manufacturing is a major force in the local economy. Now both President Obama and Mitt Romney are running television commercials that trade accusations over who is softer on China, and who is more to blame for sending American jobs there.
The Romney campaign ad states: ''Under Obama we've lost over half a million manufacturing jobs, and for the first time China is beating us. Seven times Obama could have stopped China's cheating. Seven times he refused.'' Then it cuts to Mr. Romney, who declares, ''It's time to stand up to the cheaters and make sure we protect jobs for the American people.'' 
The announcer concludes, ''Barack Obama: failing to stop cheating, failing American workers.''
The Obama campaign ad, released a day after the Romney one first appeared, opens on an incredulous note. ''Mitt Romney tough on China?'' an announcer asks. ''Romney's companies were called pioneers in shipping U.S. manufacturing jobs overseas. He invested in firms that specialized in relocating jobs to low-wage countries like China. Even today part of Romney's fortune is invested in China. Romney's never stood up to China. All he's done is send them our jobs.''
Who is right? Mr. Romney's first claim -- that more than half a million manufacturing jobs have disappeared since Mr. Obama took office -- is supported by data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which show manufacturing employment at 12.5 million in January 2009 and put it at just under 12 million as of August, a net loss because of job cuts during the recession.
However, what the ad does not say is that manufacturers have actually added several hundred thousand jobs since early 2010, a bright spot in an otherwise dull economy.
His second claim, regarding the ''seven times Obama could have stopped China's cheating,'' refers to the Treasury Department's repeated decisions -- under both the Obama and George W. Bush administrations -- to decline to label China a currency manipulator. Mr. Romney has said he would reverse that course, a position that has alarmed some free-trade Republicans, who think the move could escalate tensions between the United States and China.
Mr. Obama has made the term ''outsourcing pioneer'' a regular line in his stump speech and a catchphrase in his advertising. It is also one of the most disputed accusations of the presidential campaign. Its origins lie in a Washington Post article from June, in which the paper reported that Bain Capital, the private equity company Romney founded, ''owned companies that were pioneers in the practice of shipping work from the United States to overseas call centers and factories.''
But to say that these companies were ''pioneers'' -- that is, literally paving the way for others to ship jobs overseas -- has been called a stretch by independent fact-checkers because it misleadingly implies that Bain was leading an industry trend at the time. The Romney campaign tried, but ultimately failed, to win a retraction from The Post for its story, which the Obama campaign used as fodder for an attack ad immediately after its publication.
As for the ad's other claim, that part of Mr. Romney's fortune is tied to Chinese investments? It is true, but it fails to note that this is not due to any action on Mr. Romney's part. This year, The New York Times reported that late last year ''a Bain-run fund in which a Romney family blind trust has holdings purchased the video surveillance division of a Chinese company.''
Though Mr. Romney has had no role in Bain's operations since 1999, his fortune is still closely linked to the company.

HEADLINE: Debating Illegal Immigration and Charitable Giving

 BODY:
In ''Divided by Immigration Policy,'' on the cover of last Sunday's Metropolitan section, John Leland profiled friends and families split by President Obama's recent executive order that gave some illegal immigrants who came to the country before age 16 the chance to avoid deportation for two years. Commenters on NYTimes.com debated the policy and whether illegal immigrants deserved sympathy. Readers also discussed Ginia Bellafante's Big City column, which questioned whether increased charitable giving could replace cuts to government social services, as some Republican have argued. A selection of comments is below.
Sad stories, but surely these people, who were mostly teenagers when they came here, understood the concept of ''illegal'' before they got here. They came anyway and now expect us to ignore our laws. There are 23 million Americans unemployed or underemployed; we simply can't provide for the entire world. We need to reduce even legal immigration and deport all illegal aliens that we can find. We just can't afford to be so lackadaisical in enforcing our laws: Our own people need those jobs.

It is understandable that Americans are wary of more immigrants in the U.S. job market. But, honestly, if you're unemployed, what job did you apply for that an immigrant ''stole'' from you or a family member? Just list one example. Please remember that economic migrants would not come to the U.S. if they were not being hired. Perhaps the scapegoats for your angry rants should be U.S. employers, instead.
K,
TX
You've hit the nail on the head. Very few people reading the NYT online have probably lost a job to an illegal immigrant. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist. It's just that it exists among those most NYT readers are probably not familiar with.
People with high-school diplomas who used to do construction -- union construction -- for example. It is now pretty much impossible for someone paying union wages to submit a winning bid in the U.S. Almost all are predicated on the use of illegal immigrant labor.
Siobhan,
New York
You call them illegals, but this group came when they were minors at the behest of responsible adults. Also this concept of illegal immigrant is fairly new. It is clear to me that rigid immigration rules with no hope for earning citizenship just create more inequality -- i.e. creating an underclass. This hurts all of us. I think it is very appropriate -- and very American -- to push against that injustice and that these young people are very American already.

The Limits of Charity
We need to redefine charitable donation. Charity is giving without the expectation of some kind of return to someone in need. Philanthropy is giving to institutions that promote excellence and culture. Giving to your church is supporting your faith, tithing.
This is why we cannot abdicate the safety net to the kindness of strangers. It is not sustainable. People need food every day, they need health care, they need shelter. It is not a fashion, a mood, or a whim for a socialite who lacks basic empathy and is driven by ego.
I work with a social-service organization, and we will need to increase our donations by about 12 percent per year to sustain our costs and the increased demand. Yet, the old people who gave to groups like us because this is what you did are dying. We now have to compete with the fashionable charities and we have to sell ourselves as an investment.
It is imperative to sustain the safety net. This is a crisis. The dystopia is here, it is not some indie film.
Stellaa,
Santa Rosa, Ca
Unfortunately, government social services are out of control, with grants in the form of welfare, food stamps, WIC, housing, etc., going to able-bodied people who did not want to work even when jobs were available, who have babies for the income and perks, and file millions of false disability claims. I am quite happy to have people give to charitable causes. I feel incredibly ripped-off by many of the people that the government supports.
California doctor,
California
As a middle-class taxpayer, I resent having to take up the slack caused by the wealthy's ''charitable'' deductions for their gifts to their universities, art leagues and velodromes on public park lands where I used to go picnicking. I can't afford to send my kids to their university, attend the gala opening of the museum's newly acquired collection in its newly constructed wing, and the Schwinn I bought at Sears eight years ago doesn't ''fit'' well at the velodrome. I guess I'd rather see the truly public services, facilities or assistance that taxes on these ''charitable deductions'' should have bought. To do that, the law will have to be changed, but guess who ''owns'' the lawmakers.
Bob Walton,
Severn, MD
For those of us who work in social services, there definitely is a feeling of disappointment when we see large amounts of ''charitable'' giving going to institutions of great wealth, like many museums and universities. But it is hard to criticize those who are willingly giving away their own money to causes they believe in.
David Nocenti,
New York, New York
The nonprofit sector in the U.S. is unique in its size and reach. It historically funds and runs all manner of programs that are almost entirely funded by government in most other countries. Their Yale Universities, their museums and their social-service programs are almost entirely funded by government. The amount of contributions going to activities that help the less fortunate is substantial.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Preparing For a Long Siege Of Arab Unrest

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After days of anti-American violence across the Muslim world, the White House is girding itself for an extended period of turmoil that will test the security of American diplomatic missions and President Obama's ability to shape the forces of change in the Middle East.
Although the tumult subsided Saturday, senior administration officials said they had concluded that the sometimes violent protests in Muslim countries may presage a period of sustained instability with unpredictable diplomatic and political consequences. While pressing Arab leaders to tamp down the unrest, Mr. Obama's advisers say they may have to consider whether to scale back diplomatic activities in the region.
The upheaval over an anti-Islam video has suddenly become Mr. Obama's most serious foreign policy crisis of the election season, and a range of analysts say it presents questions about central tenets of his Middle East policy: Did he do enough during the Arab Spring to help the transition to democracy from autocracy? Has he drawn a hard enough line against Islamic extremists? Did his administration fail to address security concerns? 
These questions come at an inopportune time domestically as Mr. Obama enters the fall campaign with a small lead in polls. His policies escaped serious scrutiny in the initial days after the attack that killed four Americans in Libya last week, in part because of the furor over a statement by Mitt Romney accusing the president of sympathizing with the attackers. White House officials said they recognized that if not for Mr. Romney's statement, they would have been the ones on the defensive.
As of Saturday night, the worst of the crisis appeared to have passed, at least for now. The Egyptian government, responding to administration pressure, cracked down on protesters in Cairo on Saturday, and in Libya the government rounded up suspects in the violence that killed four Americans on Tuesday. Leaders in Saudi Arabia and Tunisia appealed for calm.
Still, images from the past week of American flags being torn down and burned, an Islamic flag being raised and embassies being overrun by angry mobs introduce a volatile element into a re-election effort in which foreign policy has been a strength. Some critics and commentators were already evoking the images of the Iranian hostage crisis that doomed another presidency.
''After Obama's success in killing Osama bin Laden, in killing Qaddafi and in not blowing up Iraq, I think Obama and his aides figured, 'We've got this box pretty well taken care of,' '' said Michael Rubin, a Middle East scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a former Bush administration official, referring to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya.
''Now that gets thrown up into the air,'' he said. ''Instead of Obama being the successful guy that got Bin Laden, we're talking about Obama as the second coming of Jimmy Carter, and that's not something the campaign wants to see.''
Mr. Obama came to office vowing to recalibrate America's relationship with the Muslim world after the Iraq war and gave a high-profile speech in Cairo outlining a new era of fraternity. Caught off guard by cascading revolutions in the Middle East, he eventually supported rebels who overthrew Egypt's longtime president and ordered airstrikes that helped bring down Colonel Qaddafi, who was later killed.
But his administration has struggled to find a balance between supporting democracy and guarding national interests in the region as authoritarian governments have been replaced by popular Islamist parties much less tied to Washington. To the extent that the United States supports greater democracy, it may not defuse anti-American rage in a region with no real history of popular rule, and with deep economic troubles. His citing of Libya as a model of transition now looks suspect, and the United States has been powerless to stop a bloody crackdown in Syria.
Administration officials say they are acutely aware of the risks, and they worry that the violence could rage for a while, because with every new protest more people are exposed to the inflammatory American-made anti-Islam video that has fueled so much anger. Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen on Saturday called for further attacks against American embassies.
''The reality is the Middle East is going to be turbulent for the foreseeable future and beyond that,'' said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former State Department official in the Bush administration. ''It's going to present the United States with any number of difficult choices. It's also going to be frustrating, because in most instances our interests are likely to be greater than our influence.''
Administration officials say the people in the streets are not the ones who won the elections, but those who lost, and that the new governments largely have condemned the violence. Mr. Obama's outreach, they said, has improved the position of the United States in the Muslim world. ''We have made significant inroads in demonstrating that the U.S. is not at war with Islam, and isolating Al Qaeda as an element within Islam,'' said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser. ''But it clearly remains the case that there are persistent challenges in parts of the Arab world. It's been building up for a very long time.''
The twin challenges of dealing with the crisis overseas and the politics of it at home overlap in complicated and uncomfortable ways. Just hours after mourning in the Rose Garden last Wednesday for American victims of a Libyan attack, Mr. Obama flew off to a Las Vegas campaign event. After meeting their flag-draped coffins at Joint Base Andrews on Friday, he headed to Democratic headquarters for campaign meetings and then to an evening fund-raiser.
In his weekly address on Saturday, Mr. Obama referred to American anxieties about the unrest. ''I know the images on our televisions are disturbing,'' he said. ''But let us never forget that for every angry mob, there are millions who yearn for the freedom and dignity and hope that our flag represents.''
During marathon meetings at the White House since the killings of American diplomatic officials in Benghazi, officials have tried to anticipate the next developments and contemplate a response. But they were surprised when an American-run school was ransacked in Tunisia, which they considered a successful transition.
Even as more Marines are sent to diplomatic missions, and two Navy destroyers patrol nearby, Mr. Obama has reached out to leaders like Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, and aides asked YouTube to review its posting of the video.
More broadly, the Obama team is confronting the very nature of America's presence in the Middle East. With embassies already fortified after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, officials are asking whether they can be further secured or whether some activities need to be curtailed, like assistance and public diplomacy programs that leave Americans more exposed, though there are no plans at the moment to do so. The State Department said Saturday that it was evacuating all family members and nonessential personnel from embassies in Tunis and Khartoum.
The trade-offs of such choices are stark. Pulling back on American involvement in these countries would undercut the ability to build cultural bridges that in theory diminish the sort of hostility now vividly on display. Yet officials said continuing with business as usual seemed untenable as well, and they recognize that foreign aid, already a tough sell in a rigid fiscal environment, may become even tougher to extract from Congress.
At home, the challenge is political but no less daunting. Republicans have had a hard time putting up a fight on foreign policy but believe the uprisings provide a new opening. Mr. Romney characterizes Mr. Obama's approach to the Arab Spring as nave and apologetic, and his campaign has criticized the president as not being supportive enough of Israel.
In recent days, Republican critics like former Vice President Dick Cheney have opened up a new line of attack by accusing Mr. Obama of not paying enough attention to intelligence briefings. Mr. Obama receives the briefing in writing every day, but does not always sit down for an oral presentation, as President George W. Bush did. ''The hubris of a president who believes he does not need to meet regularly with them is astounding,'' Marc Thiessen, a former speechwriter for Mr. Bush, wrote in The Washington Post.
The White House says the president receives plenty of briefings and meets repeatedly with security advisers. ''The president's record, when it comes to acting on -- interpreting correctly and acting on -- intelligence in the interest of the security of the United States is one that we are happy to have examined,'' said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary.
As for the broader debate, Mr. Obama's defenders argue that the legacy of American support for Arab autocrats complicated the situation. ''Obama did his best, in a very difficult situation, to get the United States on the right side of history,'' said Martin S. Indyk, a former ambassador to Israel in the Clinton administration. ''But we had a good 40 years of U.S. policy backing regimes that the people in the street overthrew.''
Some analysts pointed to his failure to make progress between the Israelis and the Palestinians. ''You didn't have a track record to use with these Arab elites to say, 'We're doing the right things,' '' said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former ambassador to Egypt and Israel who teaches at Princeton.
Over the last week, Mr. Rubin said, Mr. Obama suffered from an intelligence breakdown, much as Mr. Bush did before the Iraq war. ''That's not Obama's fault,'' he said, ''but it's going to make him look weak because he's the one sitting in the Oval Office.''

HEADLINE: Kick-Starts From a Phone and the Fed

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
HELP for the beleaguered economy came last week from two powerhouses: the Federal Reserve and ... Apple.
The Fed, believe it or not, was probably the more innovative of the two.
Maybe that shouldn't be so surprising. These are the post-Steve Jobs years at Apple, after all, a time of big profits and seamless execution. At the Fed, these are the Ben S. Bernanke years, a period of ceaseless experimentation.
The Fed's latest plan may be the most ambitious of all, but Mr. Bernanke has been coming up with inventive solutions since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007. His previous ventures have been limited in scope -- like cutting interest rates or buying bonds, with a clear goal in sight.
Now the Fed is taking on an open-ended commitment to bolster growth and reduce unemployment. The goal is to return the economy and the job market to something resembling a normal state. ''We're looking for ongoing, sustained improvement in the labor market,'' Mr. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said in a news conference on Thursday. ''There's not a specific number we have in mind. What we've seen in the last six months isn't it.'' 
In other words, if the Fed's current spate of bond-buying doesn't work, it will improvise until it finds something that does. Mr. Bernanke embarked on this effort under considerable pressure, all but assured in this political campaign season that he would be harshly criticized.
Apple, by contrast, is operating from a position of strength; it has the highest market value of any company in the nation. But it isn't taking big risks. With the fanfare of a carmaker back in Detroit's halcyon days, Apple proclaimed on Wednesday that it was time -- yet again -- to sell the newest version of its flagship product. The gleaming object of its promotional efforts is, of course, the iPhone 5, ''the thinnest, lightest and best iPhone we have ever shipped,'' in the words of Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive.
Not to be outdone, Philip W. Schiller, Apple's global marketing chief, was, if anything, even more enraptured. ''It is an absolute jewel,'' Mr. Schiller told a carefully assembled crowd in San Francisco. ''It is the most incredible product we've ever made, bar none.''
Is it, really? It's too early to say. The iPhone 5 hasn't yet hit the market. Tech mavens haven't reviewed it carefully. But, blemishes and all, previous versions have sold extraordinarily well. There is no indication that this one will be different.
One reason is simply that the base of iPhone customers has become large and well conditioned. It is accustomed to upgrading phones, much as affluent Americans once upgraded to the next new Ford or Buick. ''My dad bought a new Cadillac every year,'' said Charles Wolf, senior analyst at Needham & Company. ''A lot of Apple customers are like that.''
Another crucial factor is the expansion of Apple's global reach to 250 carrier networks worldwide, Mr. Wolf said, assuring strong global sales. Raw numbers combine with Apple's continuing finicky attention to quality and design. In his view, Apple's surge in financial markets will continue unabated, at least for a while. (Its share price hit a record high of $696.98 on Friday.)
''I think there's no question about that,'' he said. ''For the immediate future, Apple is extraordinarily well positioned.''
In fact, Apple's commercial prowess is so well established that the effects of its new iPhone can be predicted and quantified, according to Michael E. Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. In a research note early last week, he said the iPhone 5's release could potentially add one-quarter to one-half a percentage point to fourth-quarter annualized growth in the gross domestic product.
In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Feroli said his calculations included only the direct effects of the expected surge in iPhone sales. They didn't include productivity gains, if any, from use of the new technology, or possible trade-offs made by consumers who might be giving up, say, some nights at the movies to buy the phone. And, he said, he didn't try to calibrate the iPhone's impact on employment, which is complicated by the manufacture of much of the phone overseas.
''There are some jobs being created by these sales in the United States,'' he said, ''but it's not clear how many.''
Fuzzy as these projections may be, it is much harder to calibrate the economic effects of the Fed's latest stimulus effort. Mr. Feroli said Fed policy makers recognized that ''long-run economic growth usually occurs because of technological developments like the iPhone,'' so the Fed was merely ''trying to get the economy back on a cyclical growth path, getting it to operate closer to its full potential.''
Viewing the Fed and Apple as dual agents of economic stimulus is probably irresistible, he said, but too literal of a comparison is ''misguided.''
''The Fed isn't trying to engineer the factors that lead to long-run sustained increases in standards of living,'' he said. ''It's trying to get the economy working at full capacity again so more people are working and can enjoy the fruits of technical advances like those represented by the iPhone.''
Many commentators, however, couldn't resist making the comparison.
Philip Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, commented about it via Twitter. ''QE3 like iPhone5: expected, not a game-changer,'' he wrote, referring to the Fed's latest round of quantitative easing -- purchases of bonds aimed at lowering interest rates. ''Fed responding to unemployment and fiscal inaction,'' he added.
In an interview, Professor Swagel, who was assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department from December 2006 to January 2009, said: ''It's hard to second-guess someone as thoughtful as Chairman Bernanke. I understand why he's doing what he's doing, and I respect it. I just don't expect a lot to come from it.''
He said the iPhone introduction was similar: ''It's probably a nice phone, and it's probably going to produce some employment in retail stores. But it's not going to change the landscape.''
NO doubt Mr. Bernanke would prefer to stop improvising, and merely preside over a growing economy, as he did all too briefly in 2006 and early 2007.
For Apple, the greatest risk is that, without Steve Jobs to stir things up, it may merely be executing a vision that is already in place. ''Steve was an integral part of every one of Apple's great innovations and disruptions,'' Mr. Wolf said. Apple is in a groove, he said, and over the next few years, the company is likely to reap profits big enough to move the markets and the economy. ''But you could argue that over the long term, Apple is going to need another big disruption,'' he said. ''The question I ask is, Who is going to do it with Steve gone?''

HEADLINE: Don't Tell Anyone, But the Stimulus Worked

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE

 BODY:
Republicans howled on Thursday when the Federal Reserve, at long last, took steps to energize the economy. Some were furious at the thought that even a little economic boost might work to benefit President Obama just before an election. ''It is going to sow some growth in the economy,'' said Raul Labrador, a freshman Tea Party congressman from Idaho, ''and the Obama administration is going to claim credit.''
Mr. Labrador needn't worry about that. The president is no more likely to get credit for the Fed's action -- for which he was not responsible -- than he gets for the transformative law for which he was fully responsible: the 2009 stimulus, which fundamentally turned around the nation's economy and its prospects for growth, and yet has disappeared from the political conversation. 
The reputation of the stimulus is meticulously restored from shabby to skillful in Michael Grunwald's important new book, ''The New New Deal.'' His findings will come as a jolt to those who think the law ''failed,'' the typical Republican assessment, or was too small and sloppy to have any effect.
On the most basic level, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is responsible for saving and creating 2.5 million jobs. The majority of economists agree that it helped the economy grow by as much as 3.8 percent, and kept the unemployment rate from reaching 12 percent.
The stimulus is the reason, in fact, that most Americans are better off than they were four years ago, when the economy was in serious danger of shutting down.
But the stimulus did far more than stimulate: it protected the most vulnerable from the recession's heavy winds. Of the act's $840 billion final cost, $1.5 billion went to rent subsidies and emergency housing that kept 1.2 million people under roofs. (That's why the recession didn't produce rampant homelessness.) It increased spending on food stamps, unemployment benefits and Medicaid, keeping at least seven million Americans from falling below the poverty line.
And as Mr. Grunwald shows, it made crucial investments in neglected economic sectors that are likely to pay off for decades. It jump-started the switch to electronic medical records, which will largely end the use of paper records by 2015. It poured more than $1 billion into comparative-effectiveness research on pharmaceuticals. It extended broadband Internet to thousands of rural communities. And it spent $90 billion on a huge variety of wind, solar and other clean energy projects that revived the industry. Republicans, of course, only want to talk about Solyndra, but most of the green investments have been quite successful, and renewable power output has doubled.
Americans don't know most of this, and not just because Mitt Romney and his party denigrate the law as a boondoggle every five minutes. Democrats, so battered by the transformation of ''stimulus'' into a synonym for waste and fraud (of which there was little), have stopped using the word. Only four speakers at the Democratic convention even mentioned the recovery act, none using the word stimulus.
Mr. Obama himself didn't bring it up at all. One of the biggest accomplishments of his first term -- a clear illustration of the beneficial use of government power, in a law 50 percent larger (in constant dollars) than the original New Deal -- and its author doesn't even mention it in his most widely heard re-election speech. Such is the power of Republican misinformation, and Democratic timidity.
Mr. Grunwald argues that the recovery act was not timid, but the administration's effort to sell it to the voters was muddled and ineffective. Not only did White House economists famously overestimate its impact on the jobless rate, handing Mr. Romney a favorite talking point, but the administration seemed to feel the benefits would simply be obvious. Mr. Obama, too cool to appear in an endless stream of photos with a shovel and hard hat, didn't slap his name on public works projects in the self-promoting way of mayors and governors.
How many New Yorkers know that the stimulus is helping to pay for the Second Avenue subway, or the project to link the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central? Almost every American worker received a tax cut from the act, but only about 10 percent of them noticed it in their paychecks. White House economists had rejected the idea of distributing the tax cuts as flashy rebate checks, because people were more likely to spend the money (and help the economy) if they didn't notice it. Good economics, perhaps, but terrible politics.
From the beginning, for purely political reasons, Republicans were determined to oppose the bill, using silly but tiny expenditures to discredit the whole thing. Even the moderate Republican senators who helped push the bill past a filibuster had refused to let it grow past $800 billion, and prevented it from paying for school construction.
Republicans learned a lesson from the stimulus that Democrats didn't expect: unwavering opposition, distortion, deceit and ridicule actually work, especially when the opposition doesn't put up a fight. The lesson for Democrats seems equally clear: when government actually works, let the world know about it.

HEADLINE: Licensing Rules Slow Tours to Cuba

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
AS part of a newly approved ''people to people'' tour in Cuba last summer, a group of Americans met with 40 blind Havana residents, who welcomed them with poetry and conversation. Then, Cubans being Cubans, four of them pulled out instruments and within minutes, arms and legs were intertwined as Americans and Cubans danced with abandon in the front yard of Cuba's National Association for the Blind.
''All 16 Americans were crying,'' said Tom Popper, president of Insight Cuba, the tour operator that organized the trip. ''Those are moments that only happen a few times in your life, and if you had gone to Cuba by yourself, you wouldn't have been exposed to that.'' 
That sort of moment may be harder to come by in the future.
The Obama administration loosened restrictions on travel to Cuba early in 2011, allowing more than 10,000 tourists without familial, scholarly or professional ties to go there using tour operators with what are known as people-to-people licenses. But the trips, which license guidelines say should focus on ''educational exchange activities that will result in meaningful interaction'' between Americans and Cubans, have faced criticism that they are thinly veiled tourist jaunts devoted to salsa dancing rather than serious pursuits.
As a result, the process for renewing licenses has become more complicated and slower. Several high-profile institutions are still awaiting approval while others have already seen their licenses expire, including Insight Cuba, which was forced to lay off all 22 of its employees last month after filing its first renewal application in March. And now, in the prime time for planning travel to Cuba during its peak season, which starts in November, dozens of other trips are on hold, leaving tour operators fearful that the window of opportunity to visit may be closing for many travelers.
It wouldn't be the first time.
President Bill Clinton created the people-to-people license in 1999, and it came under fire from conservative Cuban politicians who argued that it allowed travel that was more pleasure than business. The Bush administration eliminated the license in late 2003, and the Obama administration revived it last year. This time around, Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, has led the charge against the licenses. And his main complaint appears to be dancing.
In a speech before the Senate last December, Senator Rubio, whose parents were born in Cuba, mocked the itinerary of an Insight Cuba trip because it included visits to several places where people would be encouraged to ''dust off their dancing shoes.''
''This is an important part of this trip,'' he said, adding that salsa dancing was not ''purposeful travel,'' as the law required, nor did it square with the president's stated goal of encouraging the creation of ''a Cuba that respects the basic rights of all its citizens.''
Senator Rubio also highlighted meetings with Cuban cultural officials, a common feature of these trips, which he said ''borders on indoctrination'' and threatened to block Roberta Jacobson's nomination as the top United States diplomat for Latin American until his concerns were addressed.
He rescinded his opposition to her appointment in March. A few weeks later, the Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Controls issued new regulations demanding more-specific justification for groups seeking people-to-people licenses. Alex Conant, a spokesman for Mr. Rubio, called it ''an overdue and welcome step.''
The changes, meant, though, that many tour operators had to refile applications that they had already submitted, in some cases just weeks before their licenses expired. Insight Cuba had to refile its renewal application, which grew to 174 pages from 10, Mr. Popper said, under new rules requiring that applicants ''describe how the educational and people-to-people exchanges you propose would enhance contact with the Cuban people, and/or support civil society in Cuba, and/or help promote the Cuban people's independence from Cuban authorities.''
An Obama administration official said that the new regulations were not meant to ''emasculate the program,'' and Jeff Braunger, program manager for Cuba travel licensing at the Office of Foreign Assets Controls, said that his office was doing its best to quickly process all the applications.
But many tour operators say that in practice, the program is dying a slow death. They say that if the licenses are not renewed soon, Americans will not be the only ones losing out. At a time when Cuba has cracked open the door to a market economy, Cubans will also lose opportunities to earn money and a connection to American travelers.
''Don't forget about the Cuban side of this,'' said Jim Friedlander, president of Academic Arrangements Abroad, which organizes trips for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and several universities. ''Cutting off these programs really does change the lives of a lot of Cubans who are not going to get to meet these Americans.''
Rita Whitt is one of those Americans. A retired teacher in Key West, Fla., she and her husband had planned a trip to Santiago de Cuba this year with Insight Cuba. They had already completed two visits with the group, and Mrs. Whitt said those trips involved a great deal of meaningful interaction, despite Mr. Rubio's characterization.
During her last trip, she said, a highlight involved small packages of guitar strings that she gave to street musicians. ''They couldn't believe that an American was giving them guitar strings,'' she said. ''And that created an opportunity for a conversation.''
''My bottom line is: the best way to spread the notion of peace and democracy is by letting the Cuban people talk to Americans,'' Mrs. Whitt said. ''If America doesn't let us go to Cuba, how are we as citizens going to spread that message?''

HEADLINE: A Lonely Redemption

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL and DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ESSEX, N.Y. -- Striding barefoot through the fields of his farm in the Adirondacks, S. B. Lewis, known as Sandy, is talking without pause, gesturing this way and that in a soft summer rain.
That Mr. Lewis is in a rage is not unusual. A few days earlier, he had watched as the computerized stock trading of Knight Capital ran amok.
''If Knight blows, six firms follow, and the whole corrupt thing goes up,'' he said. ''Predator banks and hedge funds run the market for their pleasure -- there's no rational structure, nothing!''
He is just warming up. News reports have revealed a world he knows intimately. Goldman Sachs pays vast fines to avoid prosecution for mortgage securities fraud. Barclays manipulates interest rates. The Senate exposes HSBC as a racketeering enterprise, laundering money for drug cartels. Banks are laden with bad assets. 
And Wall Street, Washington, the press corps, everyone sits and stares like so many dumb cows.
''The complicity on Wall Street is sickness!'' Mr. Lewis says. He fixes you with his laser stare. ''If you think the big firms are being honest'' -- his tone slides streetwise -- ''well, sweetheart, go think something else!''
The temptation is to dismiss Mr. Lewis, 73, as a crank, except he once ruled as an eccentric genius of arbitrage, with a preternatural feel for the tectonic movements of the markets. He has railed for decades about venalities now on daily display. Rude truth is his currency.
He knows Wall Street's heights. He helped hire Michael R. Bloomberg, and he invested the money of two former Securities and Exchange Commission chairmen, making a fortune in the 1980s. And he knows its depths, since he pleaded guilty to stock manipulation in 1989, and was barred from the Street.
President Bill Clinton pardoned him, and a federal court judge later said Mr. Lewis acted out of pure reforming impulse.
But he remains in self-imposed exile.
Mr. Lewis wants to flip over Wall Street's paving stones and search for worms. He relies on his singular strength: he discerns patterns where most see random data. He forecast the financial meltdown of 2008 that vaporized Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers. In 2006, he warned a Bear Stearns executive: ''Bear is toast. Get out now!''
Lehman Brothers, he notes, certified it was in good health in June 2008 and issued stock, attracting investment, including from the New Jersey Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund. Secretly, Lehman was on an intravenous drip, poisoned by bad debt.
''My respect for their brains is too great to think Lehman's top guys didn't know they were conveying the cynical impression of health,'' Mr. Lewis said.
He is no less suspicious of Goldman Sachs, which has alumni sprinkled across the upper reaches of government. In a tough spot, Goldman obtained extraordinary permission to make an overnight metamorphosis from investment bank to traditional bank holding company.
''Can I prove this was a wired deal? Absolutely not,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''Am I certain of it? Only 100 percent.''
As for the whirling, three-million-shares-per-second casino of Wall Street? He sees it as rigged. ''I would not risk stocks under any circumstances,'' he said, ''because we don't know when this thing is going to blow.''
Nothing about Mr. Lewis is easy. He delights in sending scabrous, insulting, free-associative mass e-mails to journalists, financiers and members of Congress. Show annoyance, and he doubles down. ''You know what I do with tension?'' he said. ''I ratchet it up!''
Not surprisingly, some dismiss him as a nut. As striking are those who pay careful heed.
''Sandy's right; government created a banking oligopoly with no accountability,'' said Peter Solomon, a friend of Mr. Lewis's who runs an investment banking firm.
Arthur Aeder, a retired accounting executive, was twice fired by Mr. Lewis. ''Not many antagonize Goldman just for the hell of it,'' Mr. Aeder said. ''Most people think, 'I have a family to feed.' ''
Mr. Lewis is no less harsh on himself. After a visit, he handed us laptops containing every furious e-mail he had sent and received over 10 years.
''The Wall Street ethic broke decades ago,'' he said by way of goodbye. ''The stink is terrible.''
MR. LEWIS was born to Wall Street royalty -- his father, Cy, was managing partner at Bear Stearns from 1949 to 1978. His parents were characters out of a Fitzgerald novel: his father was Jewish, debonair and domineering; he desired power, wealth and a beautiful woman -- wife or mistress, that mattered little. His mother, Diana Bonnor, a member of the Protestant establishment, was beautiful, brilliant and no less formidable. She cared about social justice and status and was profoundly uninterested in mothering.
''I never remember her at breakfast,'' recalled Roger Lewis, Mr. Lewis's younger brother. ''High tea? Oh, yes. Cocktails? Yes! But breakfast? Never.''
Cy doted on Sandy while Diana screamed at the boy, striking him with a hair brush when he refused to read, he said. A willful child, the boy stopped speaking for days and sometimes retreated onto a window ledge, sitting high above Park Avenue.
Another brother, John, renounced wealth, bought clothes in thrift shops and became a well-known legal-aid lawyer. Roger got off to a fine start on Wall Street until the Grateful Dead moved into his town house before Woodstock. He ingested gobs of LSD, was arrested on charges of selling drugs and served time. ''I broke all the bonds of polite behavior,'' Roger said. ''Prison was pretty fascinating.''
When Sandy Lewis was 10, his parents shipped him off to Chicago and Bruno Bettelheim's Orthogenic School, an institution for emotionally disturbed children. The first day, he held his breath until he nearly passed out. But he credits the school with saving his life; Bettelheim became a second father.
''He had Bruno's traits: he was arrogant, controlling, all powerful -- and generous,'' recalled George Kaiser, a former teacher at the school.
Mr. Lewis saw in Wall Street a three-dimensional chess game played at great velocity. ''Brain not brawn, and the smartest wins, yes!'' he said.
He came to conceive of the Street as a drainage system, every pipe connected to another. Inside information sluiced from brokerages to white-shoe law firms to investment houses.
He glimpsed this world when he returned to New York in 1964. He said he sat in the front of his father's Cadillac limousine, listening as Cy and friends talked angrily about a partner who had impersonated a reporter for The New York Times and got a half-hour drop on a Supreme Court decision. The firm profited by trading ahead of the news.
Mr. Lewis said he confronted his father that night. Dad, you must fire that man. Cy shook his head: He is too valuable, Son.
''That,'' Mr. Lewis said recently, ''was when I realized that the trouble on Wall Street was systemic.''
He refused to sit at the Four Seasons trolling for inside tips and paying for call girls for clients.
He was fired by all the best firms: Salomon Brothers, White Weld, Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch. At Merrill, the chief executive officer at the time, Donald Regan, pursued a system to buy and sell stocks without using the exchange floor. Mr. Lewis came to see this creation as unfair to the public.
So Mr. Lewis, in speeches and work with the S.E.C., fought to make all sales transparent on the floor of the exchange. ''In one of my periodic periods of unemployment, I walked down the street thinking, 'O.K., now I'm going to sabotage Don Regan,' '' he said. ''I have six kids and I'm going to be eating worms.''
He worked briefly for Ivan F. Boesky, until he realized the arbitrage specialist was trolling for inside information. Mr. Lewis quit and Mr. Boesky was later imprisoned.
To find a place that would not fire him, in 1980 Mr. Lewis established S. B. Lewis and Company. The company's returns were meteoric -- over 50 percent annual returns after expenses. Former employees recall a brilliant arbitrageur who could, without warning, go to ''Sandy World,'' a mental planetoid with a population of one.
Mr. Lewis brokered the merger between Sandy Weill's Shearson and James Robinson's American Express.
''I told Robinson: 'Weill's got the brains; you've got great class. It's perfect,' '' Mr. Lewis recalled.
He had found success, a lovely wife and five boys and a girl, with a home in Short Hills, N.J. Except his volcanic pit never stopped rumbling.
IN November 1988, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the United States attorney, indicted Mr. Lewis on 22 charges, accusing him of manipulating the stock of a large insurer. Mr. Giuliani was a Savonarola in the canyons of mammon, and Mr. Lewis would fall beneath his sword.
Rivals shared laughs at Sandy the Moralist laid low. The trouble, however, took root not in venality but in his mania to police his industry. He had watched as insiders reaped profits by driving down prices before shares went public.
He laid a trap. He asked another securities firm to buy stock in the insurer to shore up the price. I'll cover your losses and describe the payments as ''investment banking services,'' he told them.
Mr. Lewis hoped to deliver a delicious kick to the teeth of the insiders. He made not a dime; his firm was not involved in the offering.
Years later, a federal judge, William C. Conner, described Mr. Lewis's action as ''an act of market vigilantism in which Lewis in no way personally profited.'' He was infuriated, the judge wrote, ''by what he viewed as the unethical actions of arbitrageurs.''
''He was the Lone Ranger,'' Mr. Solomon recalled, ''and Giuliani treated him like a member of the corrupt club.''
Prosecutors threatened Mr. Lewis with 15 years if he went to trial. His wife, Barbara, urged him to cut a deal. He argued prison would be interesting. His bravado reinforced her fears.
Silver haired and trim, she looks at Mr. Lewis, still consumed: ''I thought he would die. That was weak of me.''
He pleaded guilty to three charges, and the judge handed him three years' probation and a $250,000 fine.
TELL us about Bill Clinton. Mr. Lewis cannot resist a smile; even by his standards, this is a weird tale.
In the summer of 1994, Mr. Lewis -- in exile -- got a phone call at his Maine home from his friend, Douglas S. Eakeley. Mr. Eakeley was also an old friend of Mr. Clinton's.
I want you to go to a fund-raiser in Portland, Mr. Eakeley said, and talk with the president about his womanizing.
Is this, Mr. Lewis asked, an intervention?
As it happens, Mr. Lewis possesses a sixth sense for psychic pain. He can pick the addicted, the sick and the depressed out of a crowd. His fractured childhood and pathological candor give him an expert hand with the singed.
He rounded up Barbara and a friend, Dr. Stanley Evans, and drove to see Mr. Clinton at the Holiday Inn by the Bay.
Mr. Lewis introduced himself. ''You're Doug's friend?'' the president said, according to Mr. Lewis and Dr. Evans. ''Wait, we'll talk.''
The Secret Service escorted Mr. Lewis, his wife and the doctor into the kitchen, and the president followed.
''Sir,'' Mr. Lewis recalled saying as he stared at Mr. Clinton. ''Doug thought maybe I should spend a weekend with you. It would be the two of us only.''
Mr. Lewis said the president was taken aback. ''What is this about?''
''Sir,'' Mr. Lewis said, ''this is about your most personal business. You probably won't be too happy with me by Monday morning, but I think we can avoid a train wreck.''
The president's face flushed. Dr. Evans realized his friend was confronting the president about his extramarital affairs. ''I thought Sandy had lost his mind,'' he said.
The weekend session never took place. Revelations of the president's sexual dalliance with Monica Lewinsky came years later.
Mr. Eakeley is circumspect. ''Sandy has incredible intuition and intellect, and I knew he could help if the president could stand it,'' he said. ''Sandy may have alarmed the president, but I don't think he repelled him.''
Mr. Clinton's office declined to comment.
So it goes for Mr. Lewis on his walk, decades long, through the wilderness. One night, he said, he yanked a truck driver out of a fiery wreck on the New Jersey Turnpike, only to discover that the driver had Mafia connections. He said a mob representative told him he could call in his i.o.u. anytime; Mr. Lewis declined, politely.
He became the de facto impresario of the Clinton Correctional Facility, a prison near his farm in the Adirondacks, arranging frequent performances. The prison has housed a who's who of the criminal and homicidal, from Lucky Luciano to the serial killer Joel Rifkin.
Recently, Mr. Lewis brought in Helena Baillie, 30, an accomplished violinist who is akin to his surrogate daughter, to perform Bach's ''Chaconne'' in the Church of St. Dismas, the Good Thief. Many prisoners were in tears.
Mr. Eakeley said Mr. Lewis might be better for his exile. One of Mr. Lewis's sons, John, is not convinced. He sees a father become ''walking id.''
''Giuliani,'' he said, ''obliterated some part of him.''
In 2000, Mr. Eakeley and former Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach worked pro bono and submitted a pardon application to Mr. Clinton. In January 2001, just before leaving office, the president signed it.
Six years later, Judge Conner overturned the S.E.C. order that barred Mr. Lewis from Wall Street. ''Federal regulations now outlaw the very practice his actions were meant to thwart,'' the judge noted.
No cloud of mellow descended. Mr. Lewis trailed the S.E.C. counsel out of the courthouse. ''I will rip your guts out,'' he bellowed. ''Letter to follow!''
A few days later, he looked at the mountains and experienced an epiphany: ''I've gotten my redemption, and no one cares.''
THE phone rings and Mr. Lewis, in midsentence of a long disquisition, picks up the receiver. A North Country car dealer asks about the economy.
''Yes? Yes!'' he listens for 30 seconds. ''It's going to get a lot worse. We'll be burning scrap wood in our fireplaces before it's over. Goodbye!''
Among residents of this rural land, Mr. Lewis has a reputation as a savant. He warned that the housing market was overheating years ago and sold several properties. He converted to cash before the 1987 stock crash.
Still, he could not complete the last act in his redemptive play. Financiers with White House connections solicited his advice during the 2008 crisis. But he was not invited into the circle of advisers who, to his mind, poorly served this young president.
As a Wall Street friend warned in an e-mail: ''Sandy, you constantly kill yourself. You exhaust folks.''
Mr. Lewis considers his plight over a dinner with Barbara. His eyes are red, his voice a rasp. ''I'm bright as hell, but I'm impossible to live with.'' Barbara nods. ''I am in a state of outrage all the time.'' Barbara nods. ''I bring this Orthogenic morality to everything on Wall Street, and it's unsustainable.'' Barbara, dry as gin, says, ''No kidding.''
Mr. Lewis sees a banking system in unstable remission. Goldman answers to no one. China and Europe are wobbling, deflation is at the door, another crash is coming.
''The criminality is astounding,'' he says. ''You have a complete confusion between principal and principle.''
He is pacing again. ''You don't understand what it is to find someone on Wall Street who tells it like it is. You want to get real? Baby, let's do the full root canal!''

HEADLINE: New Territory for Ads, With a Moving Target

BYLINE: DAVID W. DUNLAP


HIGHLIGHT: Advertisers are using MetroCards, bus windows and interactive digital technology to reach commuters. 

 BODY:
In the next month or two, subway and bus riders will find advertising where they have never seen it before: on the face of their MetroCards, always with them and inescapable - at least for that moment they pay their fare.
The front of the MetroCard is not the only new territory being given over to commerce. This year, for the first time, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority began allowing ads to cover passenger windows on buses. Calvin Klein and Broadway producers embraced the spot.
At the same time, interactive digital advertising has arrived on an immense scale. Along 60 feet of a mezzanine corridor at the Columbus Circle station, those so inclined could either try to outrun an image of Ryan Hall, courtesy of Asics, or try to play fetch with a virtual dog, courtesy of the dog food company Beneful.
Then there are naming rights: for $200,000 a year, the authority has added the designation "Barclays Center" to the name of the Atlantic Avenue stations in Brooklyn. The measure is one part customer service - the new arena by that name is a block away - and two parts marketing, as the arena and stations now carry the name of a giant international financial services company.
Commercial marketing has been interwoven with transit since early days: car cards, wall posters, even naming rights. (The station at Broadway and 42nd Street was named for a private company, The New York Times, even before the first trains rolled in 1904.)
Now, as new digital information systems are introduced, ads are coming along with them.
It is a big business. This year, the authority expects to receive $120 million from advertising in the subway, on buses, on its two commuter railroads and on billboards along its routes. Its spokesman Aaron Donovan said this compared with $106 million in 2007 and $38 million in 1997.
"In the midst of a recession that has battered the advertising sector, our advertising revenue has increased significantly over the past five years," Mr. Donovan said, "in part through the use of innovative digital technologies that we've welcomed into the system."
In an overall annual operating budget of $13.1 billion, advertising revenue pays almost 1 percent of the costs. About half of that revenue comes from a single contract, with CBS Outdoor, for subway-related advertising. This year, CBS paid the authority $61.8 million. The 10-year contract, which expires in 2015, has an overall minimum guaranteed value of $580 million. Payments may even be higher if business is especially good.
CBS Outdoor said through a spokeswoman, Jodi Senese, that the growth in ad sales could be traced to increased ridership, new formats that "pique advertiser interest in the medium generally" and the "constriction of other 'out-of-home' opportunities," like advertisements on sidewalk scaffolding.
No transit system can afford to leave money on the table, said Art Guzzetti, the vice president for policy at the American Public Transportation Association in Washington. "We're growing in ridership, but revenues have not grown," he said in a telephone interview. "We're strapped for revenues, and have to turn over every rock."
For that reason, Gene Russianoff of the riders' advocacy group Straphangers Campaign, said he was reluctant to criticize the increasingly aggressive search by the transportation authority for nongovernment financing. "They're doing what they've been asked to do," he said, "and it's hard to fault them."
But revenues come with a cost of their own, suggested Siva Vaidhyanathan, the chairman of the media studies department at the University of Virginia.
"We've gotten to the point now where the M.T.A. doesn't respect its own environment and is filling it with sight pollution," he said in a phone interview. "A bright yellow subway car, branded to sell something, is not comfortable, it's not respectful and it's not dignified."
"Environmentally, the city should be paying attention to dignity as a quality-of-life indicator," Professor Vaidhyanathan said.
There are restraints, it turns out. Transportation officials will not permit city buses to be fully wrapped in advertising, in part because no one - including police officers - can clearly see what is going on behind windows covered in vinyl sheets. The new exterior ads, called "L-sides," are limited to a single window on one side of a bus: 20.5 square feet of glass.
The product used by CBS Outdoor, Contra Vision, is described as see-through. But it might be likened to a very fine colander. In both cases, one is looking through a field of small perforations.
In a joint statement, the transportation authority and CBS said they did not believe that "placing Contra Vision on a single window compromises the passenger experience in any material way."
"If a particular passenger prefers an entirely unobstructed view, there are plenty of windows to chose from," they said. "The M.T.A.'s customers have never hesitated to voice concerns with respect to the advertising that appears on its buses, yet the M.T.A. has not to date received a single complaint about this ad medium."
Since 2003, the authority has allowed the shuttle and a few other subway trains to be wrapped, though windows may not be covered. Occasionally, advertisers will also install up to six "video car cards" with 11-inch screens (measured diagonally) in each car. These play silent visual loops. Audio is not an option.
The authority "would like to see more of this kind of thing," Mr. Donovan said, "and is open to the introduction of digital media in a variety of formats throughout the system."
There are now 100 "urban panels" at subway entrances, with digital screens on both sides. (A year ago, there were 80 one-sided panels.) The side facing the stairs can show updated transit information at the bottom of the screen. A traveler reading the screen might learn of delays on the Seventh Avenue line, for example, and decide instead to take an Eighth Avenue train. The outward-facing side shows 15-second commercials on a 55-inch screen. 
More screens are coming. In a pilot program called On the Go, the authority placed free-standing, interactive kiosks in five subway stations last year. These carry status reports on subway, elevator and escalator service; large, legible subway maps that can be summoned by fingertip; and digital advertisements. The program is to be expanded, and Ms. Senese said CBS was "interested in the commercial potential of these screens."
Since its contract began in 2006, CBS Outdoor has introduced branded turnstile arms, usually as part of a larger station domination by a single advertiser; "stripes" running on the sides of Seventh Avenue, Lexington Avenue and shuttle trains; and "headliners" that stretch across the entire top of some buses, chiefly in Manhattan.
It tried and abandoned floor decals ("Foot traffic rendered them unattractive," Ms. Senese said) and digital ads projected on screens. It determined that the technology is not yet at hand to permit columns and walls to be wrapped in light-emitting material. Nor does it envision any "cross-track" ads; that is, panels placed in the track well that can be read by passengers standing on the opposite platform. "'Cross-track' is difficult to execute in a 24-hour system," Ms. Senese said.
Professor Vaidhyanathan, for one, would like to see some more restraint. He bristled at the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center name. "What happens if Barclays is convicted of massive fraud in the Libor scandal?" he asked. "What happens if Barclays goes out of business?"
Alternately, however, what if the bank and the new name show some staying power? After all, "Times Square" seems to have caught on.

HEADLINE: Is Poverty a Kind of Robbery?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama and the Democratic Party haven't had much to say about the desolation and exploitation of the very poor. 

 BODY:
New Haven
In her presentation on Sept. 7 at a symposium on inequality at Yale, Alice Goffman, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin, talked about the winter of 2011-2012, which she spent living in Detroit among the very poor. Goffman described some of the effects of extreme poverty by quoting the words of a Detroit resident to whom she gave the pseudonym "Marqueta":
Your fingers get slow, you know, your whole body slows down. You can't really do much, you try to put a good face on for the kids, but when they leave you just keep still, keep the covers around you. Almost like you kind of fold into the floor. Like you're just waiting it out. You don't really think about too much. November your stomach is crying at you but by December you know, you start to just shut down . Around 3 you get up for the kids. Put the space heaters, so they come home and it's warm in here.
There are further manifestations of the suffering on the east side of Detroit, according to Goffman:
The cold, hunger, and the depression that accompanies them both, makes for a certain moral relativism. Lots of people have written about what people become willing to do under conditions of uncertainty and extreme duress. Sailors who are lost at sea, or people in war. By the end of Detroit's winter people become willing to do to things that they would not have considered in the more plentiful months. Like stealing, or selling their bodies.
Underneath the statistics, hidden behind the desolation of the poor in the poorest big city in the United States, lies one of most intractable political dilemmas of our era: Can the Democratic party, the party of the left, address issues of poverty and want in today's political environment? For example, can they talk about hunger?
Hunger has grown sharply since the financial collapse of 2008, although it is felt acutely by a relatively small percentage of the population. In 2007, 12.2 percent of Americans experienced what the Department of Agriculture describes as "low food security," including 4 percent who fell into the category of very low food security. By 2011, the percentage of those coping with low food security rose to 16.4 percent, and those experiencing very low food security went up to 5.5 percent.
The U.S.D.A. defines "low food security" as a lack of access "at all times to enough nutritious food for an active, healthy life." It defines "very low food security" as individuals going without or with very little food "at times during the year because the household lacked money and other resources for food."
Looked at through the calculus of contemporary partisan politics, the U.S.D.A. data demonstrates that in 2011 low food security was a problem for just under one in eight whites - a matter of concern but for many white voters, a virtually invisible issue. Very low food security affects the lives of only one in 24 whites.
For African Americans, low food security is a problem affecting one in four, and one in ten experience very low food security. The percentage of Hispanics who experience low food security is higher than the percentage of blacks, although the percentage of Hispanics suffering very low food security is slightly lower.
Here is the 2007 U.S.D.A. data broken down by race and ethnicity:
And here is the parallel data for 2011:
The issue of hunger sheds light on the broader politics of poverty.
Democrats have concluded that getting enough votes on Nov. 6 precludes taking policy positions that alienate middle-class whites. In practice this means that on the campaign trail there is an absence of explicit references to the poor - and we didn't hear much about them at the Democratic National Convention either.
Republicans, in turn, see taking a decisive majority of white votes as their best chance of winning the presidency. The 2012 electorate is likely to be 72% white, according to a number of analyses. In this scenario, Republicans need to get at least 62 percent of the white vote to win, and Democrats need to get 38 percent or more of the white vote.
Elijah Anderson, a sociologist at Yale and the author of several highly praised books about race and urban America, including "The Cosmopolitan Canopy," organized the symposium. When I asked him about the Democrats' problems in addressing poverty, Anderson wrote back in an email:
Apparently, the Republicans have backed the Democrats, and President Obama in particular, into the proverbial racial corner. It is a supreme irony that Obama, the nation's first African-American President, finds himself unable to advocate for truly disadvantaged blacks, or even to speak out forthrightly on racial issues. To do so is to risk alienating white conservative voters, who are more than ready to scream, "we told you so," that Obama is for "the blacks." But it is not just the potential white voters, but the political pundits who quickly draw attention to such actions, slanting their stories to stir up racial resentment. Strikingly, blacks most often understand President Obama's problems politically, and continue to vote for him, understanding the game full well, that Obama is doing the "best he can" in what is clearly a "deeply racist society." It's a conundrum.
The issue of race helps to explain another development in academia as well as in the public debate: the near abandonment of the once powerful tradition of exposing the exploitation of the poor. 
Matthew Desmond, an assistant professor of sociology at Harvard, another speaker at the Yale symposium, described the extensive history of landlords, lenders and employers profiting from the rent and labor of slum dwellers. Desmond posed a question:
If exploitation long has helped to create the slum and its inhabitants, if it long has been a clear, direct, and systematic, cause of poverty and social suffering, why, then, has this ugly word - exploitation - been erased from current theories of urban poverty?
Instead, Desmond argued, contemporary urban poverty research
pivots upon the concept of a lack. Structural accounts emphasize the inner city's lack of jobs, social services, or organizations. Cultural accounts emphasize the inner city's lack of role models, custodial fathers, and middle-class values. Although usually pitted against one another, structural and cultural approaches share a common outlook: that the inner city is a void, a needy thing, and, like supplies lowered into the leper colony, that its problems can be solved by filing the void with more stuff: e.g., more jobs, more education, more social services.
This approach, Desmond contends, results in the misjudgment that proposals to lessen poverty by raising the minimum wage or improving welfare benefits would be sufficient. Not so, says Desmond, who spent months exploring evictions of the poor - white and black - in Milwaukee: "In a world of exploitation, such an assumption is anything but obvious."
When Desmond began his Milwaukee fieldwork, he 
wondered why middle- and upper-class landlords would buy and manage property in some of Milwaukee's roughest neighborhoods. And the end of my fieldwork, I wondered why they wouldn't. As Sherrena [Tarver, one of the landlords he spoke to] would tell me the first time we met, "The 'hood is good. There's a lot of money there. A two bedroom is a two bedroom is a two bedroom. If it's nice enough, and the people are O.K. with their living arrangements, they're gonna take it. They are at our mercy right now. They have to have a place to stay.
At the height of the housing collapse, Tarver saw an opportunity. "This moment right now," she told Desmond, "it's going to create a lot of millionaires. You know, if you have money right now, you can profit from other people's failures. I'm catching the properties. I'm catching 'em."
Desmond backs up his argument - that cash transfers to the poor get siphoned off by landlords - with evidence from his study of evictions:
If Milwaukee evictions are lowest each February, it is because many members of the city's working poor dedicate some (or all) of their Earned Income Tax Credit to pay back rent, the majority paying steep fees to receive early payments through refund anticipation loans. The E.I.T.C., it would seem, is as much a benefit to inner-city landlords and H&R Block as it is to working families. In fixating almost exclusively on what poor neighborhoods lack, social scientists and policymakers alike have overlooked a fact that never has been lost on landlords: that there is good money to be made by tapping into the riches of the slum.
Desmond makes the case for the elevation of
the concept of exploitation to a more central position within the sociology of inequality. For who could argue that the urban poor today are not just as exploited as they were in generations past, what with the acceleration of rents throughout the housing crisis; the proliferation of pawn shops, the number of which doubled in the 1990s; the emergence of the payday lending industry, boasting of more stores across the U.S. than McDonald's restaurants and netting upwards of $7 billion annually in fees; and the colossal expansion of the subprime lending industry, which was generating upwards of $100 billion in annual revenues at the peak of the housing bubble? And yet conventional accounts of inequality, structural and cultural approaches alike, continue to view urban poverty strictly as the result of some inanity. How different our theories would be - and with them our policy prescriptions - if we began viewing poverty as the result of a kind of robbery.
Desmond's presentation raises another question: How different would the nation's politics be if either party, or at least the Democrats, added the concept of economic exploitation to its repertoire?
Not only would doing so risk inflaming the issue of race, but it would put at risk existing sources of campaign finance on which both parties are dependent. The finance-insurance-real estate sector is the single largest source of cash for the Democratic Party, $46.3 million in the current election cycle, and for the Republican Party too, at $67.7 million.
This dependence on moneyed interests effectively precludes exploitation as a theme for either major party to develop. These sources of campaign cash would dry up if they became the target of policies or positions they found threatening.
Even as polarization poses more sharply defined choices to the voter, pressing issues remain off limits. Poverty and hunger have been dropped from the agenda. The range of policy and electoral choices remains confined to what fits comfortably into a world of muted ethical concern, a world in which moral relativism has permeated society not so much from the bottom up, as from the top down.
The unshackling of moneyed interests - in the name of first amendment rights - from restraints on campaign contributions has, in fact, constrained the free speech of the disadvantaged. It empowers those whose goal is to hinder consumer-protection legislation, to forestall more progressive tax rates and to quash populist insurgencies.
This skewing of the odds in favor of the rich comes at a time when the Democratic Party is already inhibited by accusations that it likes to foment "class warfare" and to play "the race card." The result has been a relentless shift of the political center from left to right. The two most recent Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, have pursued agendas well within this limited terrain. There is little reason to believe that Obama, if he wins in November, will feel empowered to push out much further into territory the Democrats have virtually abandoned.
 Thomas B. Edsall, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, is the author of the book "The Age of Austerity: How Scarcity Will Remake American Politics," which was published earlier this year.

HEADLINE: In Connecticut, Wall Street Community May Limit Obama Victory

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama is almost certain to win the state's 7 electoral votes, but by a significantly smaller margin than he did in 2008. 

 BODY:
 We continue our Presidential Geography series, a one-by-one examination of the peculiarities that drive the politics in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Here is a look at Connecticut, the Constitution State. FiveThirtyEight spoke with Paul Bass, the editor of The New Haven Independent; Gary Rose, an associate professor of political science at Sacred Heart University; Ronald Schurin, an associate professor of political science at the University of Connecticut; and Kevin F. Rennie, a columnist for The Hartford Courant and a former Republican state senator and representative. 
Connecticut is in the top-tier of safely Democratic states. Every statewide elective office is held by Democrats, as is the State Senate and State House. Democratic presidential candidates have won Connecticut in every election since 1992, and often by wide margins. President Obama carried the state by 22 percentage points in 2008.
But the most recent poll conducted in Connecticut - in late August by Quinnipiac University - found a surprising result: Mr. Obama led Mitt Romney by just 7 percentage points, 52 percent to 45 percent.
Mr. Obama's lead in that poll, while on the low end of what pollsters have found in Connecticut this year, was not an outlier. FiveThirtyEight's current polling average in the state has Mr. Obama up by 9.4 percentage points.
The current evidence suggests that, while far from a battleground state, Connecticut has soured on Mr. Obama to a greater extent than the nation as a whole since 2008. Mr. Obama's disproportionate decline there may prove exaggerated, or even completely illusory, but there are reasons to believe it is real.
First, the Connecticut economy has been struggling for a long time. Second, Connecticut has a unique bloc of affluent, Wall Street-connected voters with whom Mr. Romney may hold special appeal. And third, the state's race for the United States Senate has become competitive.
Like elsewhere in the Northeast, Connecticut was a swing state in presidential elections through most of the 20th century. Its blue-collar and heavily Roman Catholic cities and suburbs voted Democratic. Republicans won support from the suburbs that were wealthy and mostly Protestant and from the predominantly Protestant rural areas that were less well-off. Those voting patterns have largely reversed themselves, Mr. Schurin said.
Connecticut Republicans were defined by their moderation, best exemplified by middle-of-road governors like John G. Rowland and Jodi Rell and a Republican-turned-independent, Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who took office in 2011, was the state's first Democratic governor in 20 years.
As social conservatives gained more power in the Republican Party nationally, moderate Connecticut voters -- like those in New Jersey and Delaware -- began favoring Democratic candidates.
The trend has been especially evident in southwest Connecticut. Fairfield County, one of the wealthiest in the nation, is dotted by Wall Street bedroom communities, like Stamford and Greenwich, where affluent voters work for hedge funds, private equity shops and banks. These wealthy suburban communities, once a bastion of Republican support, have been trending Democratic, Mr. Bass said. Mr. Obama carried Fairfield County in 2008 by 18 percentage points.
But if Fairfield County has seen the most Democratic gains over the last two decades, it may also be where Mr. Romney might be able to make up the most ground. Many Wall Street executives appear to have lost their fondness for Mr. Obama, and Mr. Romney -- who co-founded the financial services firm Bain Capital -- may be well positioned to win their votes.
"There's a lot of people in Fairfield County like Romney," Mr. Rose said. "They even look like Romney."
It is possible that Mr. Romney could carry Fairfield County this year, Mr. Rose said. That would be enough to put a substantial dent in Mr. Obama's margin -- a quarter of votes in 2008 were cast in Fairfield -- but it would not be enough to put the state in play. There simply are not enough Republican-leaning voters in the rest of the state.
Of Connecticut's eight counties, Litchfield is the most Republican. It has pockets of Fairfield-like wealth and includes parts of the blue-collar and Republican-leaning Naugatuck River Valley. But after Litchfield, the pickings are slim for Republican candidates.
Eastern Connecticut is more sparsely populated but still leans Democratic. The rural northeast, known as the Quiet Corner, is a little more politically competitive than the southeast, where the defense industry is prominent.
And in Hartford and New Haven Counties -- which with Fairfield County are among the three most populous -- there is virtually no Republican Party presence, Mr. Rennie said. Hartford and New Haven are both overwhelmingly Democratic, with large African-American and Hispanic populations.
 The Bellwether: New Haven County 
New Haven County has matched the statewide vote in the last two presidential elections. The city of New Haven, home to Yale University, and Waterbury, which also leans Democratic, account for most of the votes cast, but the county also includes more rural and Republican-leaning parts of the Naugatuck Valley.
The New Haven area, historically a manufacturing center, has recently found new economic life in the biomedical and technology fields. But like the state as a whole, New Haven County has pockets of extreme poverty and extreme wealth.
 The Bottom Line 
Mr. Obama is a 99 percent favorite in Connecticut, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast. While the presidential race has not received much attention in Connecticut, it may affect -- or be affected by -- the state's Senate race, which has become unexpectedly interesting.
Linda E. McMahon, the Republican nominee, and Representative Christopher S. Murphy, the Democratic candidate, are battling to replace Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent who is retiring. If Mr. Obama carries Connecticut by a wide enough margin, his coattails may help Mr. Murphy overcome Ms. McMahon's significant spending advantage.
Conversely, Ms. McMahon's money has led to a mostly one-sided advertisement war, which may be another reason that Mr. Romney is staying relatively close in the Connecticut polls. The state's unemployment rate recently moved above the national average, and Ms. McMahon has saturated the state with ads highlighting the state's struggling economy. That may be indirectly hurting Mr. Obama, Mr. Rose said.
"She's almost like Romney's surrogate," he said.
Still, Mr. Romney has little chance of winning Connecticut's seven electoral votes. The best he can probably hope for is carrying Fairfield County and keeping Mr. Obama's statewide margin of victory in the low double digits or high single digits.

HEADLINE: Scandal at Florida A&M Leaves a Football Season Without Its Soundtrack

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- It felt like family inside the football stadium at Florida A&M University on Saturday night. Old friends shouted greetings and delivered tight hugs; students clustered in the stands, snapping photos with their cellphones. Grandparents adjusted their orange cushions on the metal bleachers in more or less the same spots they had claimed for decades.
But try as they might to enjoy the game, something was missing. It felt a little like a reunion without a favorite cousin, the one who gets people laughing and mingling, leaving everyone to wonder whether the party would be the same without him.
For the first time that anyone here could remember, the Marching 100 -- the university's celebrated high-stepping, tight-playing band -- was sitting out the football team's first home game. And while there were many determined fans awash in the school colors of orange and green ready to support the team, the Rattlers, and provide plenty of noise, it seemed to rise in the wrong key, at least compared with the polish of the Marching 100. 
The team won its game against Hampton University, but its touchdowns, and there were three, did not groove to brass and percussion. Timeouts lacked their usual musical score. And the field sat vacant during halftime, while Future, a rapper brought in to substitute for the band, performed off to the side on a small stage behind a fence. A few fans even left their seats during the break to buy food, unheard of when the Marching 100 is spread across the field.
''They got you ready,'' Brystal Burton, 22, a senior from Los Angeles who is majoring in biochemistry, said of the band. ''You always knew it was going to be great. The halftime -- words can't describe it.''
The Marching 100 has been suspended for the academic year, one of the many profound changes that have rocked Florida A&M since November, when Robert Champion, 26, a drum major, collapsed and died on a band bus in Orlando, Fla., after a brutal hazing. Mr. Champion was beaten by band members who used drumsticks, bass drum mallets and their hands to hit him as he walked to the back of the bus in a ritual that was called Cross Bus C for the letter on the bus.
Mr. Champion's death exposed a longstanding culture of hazing among the Marching 100 and led to investigations that also revealed financial and administrative wrongdoing at the university, primarily in the band program. The university's president, James H. Ammons, resigned; the band director, Julian White, was fired; and 12 band members were charged with felonies in Mr. Champion's death. Other hazing episodes surfaced soon after, including one in which a young woman's leg was broken.
The scandal badly tarnished the reputation of one of the most admired institutions among the nation's historically black colleges and universities.
Mr. Champion's parents are suing the university, accusing administrators of failing to do enough to stop hazing and protect students. In papers recently filed in the lawsuit, the university argued that it should not be held liable because Mr. Champion understood the dangers of hazing and still participated in the ritual. A friend told investigators that Mr. Champion had taken part because he wanted to earn the respect of a group of band members.
Since his death, the university has moved aggressively to eliminate hazing by introducing new programs, safeguards and penalties. Still, the tradition is ingrained here just as it is at many other universities.
This month, the interim president, Larry Robinson, suspended the university's all-female dance group after it was reported that the team had engaged in hazing over Labor Day weekend.
''You always have to be vigilant about it,'' Dr. Robinson said. ''I don't think any institution out there that has had the type of tragedy we have had here, or who understands the nature of hazing, can ever wake up feeling entirely confident that the bottom is completely gone. We are going to have to keep working on it.''
On Saturday, the first game day at the university's Bragg Memorial Stadium this year, the loss was palpable; at halftime, Dr. Robinson, standing on an empty field, asked for a moment of silence to honor the victims of hazing.
But the desire was evident among alumni, students and supporters to overcome the hardships and emerge stronger.
''We are definitely missing the band, but as a FAMU alum, I'm here do or die, with or without the band,'' said Sonya Demps, a 1996 graduate and a teacher in Jacksonville, Fla., who made the trip to the game with her husband and children. ''As an African-American school, we have learned to be resilient. We've had a lot of adversity, and we have continued. We will be strong.''
She added, ''I think we can endure anything for a year.''
Many people in the crowd agreed that the university had done the right thing in suspending the band and cracking down on hazing. Several students and alumni said that while the band was the university's marquee brand, the school's academic reputation was just as important.
''There is more to us than the Marching 100,'' said Ms. Burton, who emphasized that it was Florida A&M's academic reputation that had lured her to the university.
In the stadium's student area in Section R, where members of the Marching 100 would ordinarily sit in their uniforms, some of the band members piled into seats wearing orange band T-shirts. They did what they could to energize the crowd and carve out new roles: They stood in unison and vocalized the beat of fight songs. They fingered imaginary instruments. They stomped their feet.
Many also agreed that it had been necessary to suspend the band because the university needed to send a message against hazing. But they said they felt bad for freshman band members, who did not get to experience their first year of high-stepping, and for the seniors, who would not get a last chance to take the field.
The band members swayed as Future rapped. But they said they could not help but feel restless.
''People are making a good effort,'' said Jamael Medlock, 22, a senior who plays saxophone. ''People are trying to keep up the spirit. But Future, he is no comparison to the 100.''
University enrollment has also suffered, falling by 1,000: the Marching 100 served as a major recruitment tool. Dr. Robinson said the economy was mostly to blame for the falloff, although he added that the hazing charges and the band's suspension had contributed to it.

HEADLINE: The Grand Old Straight White Men's Party

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
In a Time magazine column the other day, Joe Klein scolded the Democrats for being overly preoccupied with identity politics. In its admirable drive to be inclusive, he argued, the party has treated its constituents not as a population united by common ideals and interests, but as an array of caucuses to be pandered to: African-Americans, gays, Latinos, women, youth and so on. Klein wrote that ''if I'm a plain old white insurance salesman, I look at the Democratic Party and say, What's in it for me?''
The Republicans have exactly the opposite problem: they seem to be going out of their way to make their party inhospitable to everyone but that plain old white insurance salesman. They have alienated the majority of women and the vast majority of blacks. The fraction of young voters who call themselves Republican has been shrinking for 20 years, to about one in three. The Republicans are repelling the surging Latino electorate by making themselves the party of police checks, higher fences, English-only-spoken-here and self-deportation. 
And that insurance salesman had better not be gay. The Republicans have enshrined the status of homosexuals as second-class citizens in the party platform. At their convention in Tampa, the Republicans attempted a show of ethnic and gender diversity. But as my colleague Frank Bruni pointed out, gays and lesbians were denied even that token pageantry.
Which brings me back to a story I've been following closely over the past year.
In June of 2011 the state of New York got in step with the slow march of history, legalizing same-sex marriage. Urged on by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, all of the State Senate's Democrats voted in favor except a lone fire-and-brimstone minister from the Bronx. The Republican Party opposed the measure, but four G.O.P. senators broke with their party to provide the margin of victory: Stephen Saland, Roy McDonald, Mark Grisanti and Jim Alesi.
Ever since that vote, the fate of those four Republicans has been watched as a bellwether of sorts -- a test of whether the Republican Party has room for politicians who vote their conscience against the party line. I spent some time last spring talking to the vengeful conservative operatives who were bent on punishing the apostates and to the generally more forgiving constituents in the four districts, and concluded that the gay-marriage defectors, while brave, were not as endangered as you might think.
Now we find out if I was too optimistic. Senator Alesi, who had other vulnerabilities (along with an evident bone-deep weariness of politics), decided to retire, but the other three came up against Republican primary challengers last Thursday. And the outcome, while not yet final, is instructive.
Senator Grisanti was the target of a sordidly homophobic anonymous mailing, but Buffalo's active gay community mobilized on his behalf; he also undoubtedly got credit for steering considerable state money to a city in desperate need of development. He won his primary with 60 percent of the vote. In November he will face a Democrat who also supports gay marriage, and who also beat a rival favored by the anti crowd. Two cheers for Buffalo.
Senators Saland and McDonald, who come from Hudson Valley districts that are more red-state America, are so close to their challengers in the unofficial count (Saland 42 votes ahead, McDonald 136 votes behind) that the outcome hinges on absentee ballots still being counted.
Decoding a local primary election is a highly speculative business. There is not a lot of detailed polling to help explain the voters' motivation. Familiarity and constituent service may count for more than ideology. Much hinges on turnout; since the disgruntled are more likely to show up than the complacent, lower turnouts are thought to favor challengers.
But the idea that these races were in some measure a marriage referendum is not just a media conceit. All three challengers opposed gay marriage. The contests became magnets for donations and mailings from advocates on both sides, with the big money coming from the marriage equality side. If not for the marriage issue, the incumbents might not have faced primary challenges at all. (Saland hasn't had a primary race in 32 years.) So the outcome says SOMETHING about gay marriage. But what?
Regardless of the final outcome, opponents of gay marriage will crow that just by coming so close to unseating two established, well-financed incumbents, they have demonstrated that Republican officeholders in other states risk their jobs if they support gay marriage. Proponents of same-sex marriage rights, on the other hand, will point out that they stand behind politicians who stand up for them. And win or lose, the pro-equality politicians will have something to be genuinely proud of.
The more interesting lesson, though, is not in the vote counts. It is in the conduct of the New York State Republican Party.
The New York Republican leaders read the polls, and they recognized the accelerating public support for gay marriage in New York and nationwide. They understood that same-sex marriage was, in the short run, a distraction from the economic debate the party cares about most and, sooner or later, a losing issue for them. So they decided to get past it.
First, rather than enforce party discipline, as they had done in killing a gay marriage bill in 2009, Senate Republican leaders last year freed party members to vote their conscience. Then, when the conservative base was howling for payback, the party leadership stood by the incumbents who had bucked the party line. They held fund-raisers. They helped redraw Grisanti's district map to make him less vulnerable. They supplied logistical help. Indeed, if McDonald and Saland do end up victorious in the two unfinished races -- we'll know in a few days -- it will probably be because the party mounted an aggressive absentee campaign on their behalf. They identified Saland and McDonald supporters and made sure they got their mail-in ballots filed in time. Less experienced challengers rarely mount much of an absentee operation.
The Republican leaders did not do all this because they are closet liberals. They did it because if they had killed same-sex marriage a second time, their candidates would have faced the wrath (and cash) of marriage proponents in districts across the state. Including, not incidentally, a popular Democratic governor, with whom the Republicans have forged an unusually congenial working relationship.
''Had that issue been in the forefront right now, we probably would be in trouble with a lot of seats,'' Senator Tom Libous, the deputy Senate majority leader, told me after the primary vote.
That's the sound of something you don't hear much in our politics these days, especially Republican politics: pragmatic common sense. Don't hold your breath, but if it catches on nationally, the Republicans might start to attract someone other than straight old white guys.

HEADLINE: Woman's Day Turns 75 While Looking Forward

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A MAGAZINE that was introduced when the newest technology to reach consumers was the radio soap opera wants to demonstrate its relevance to readers -- and advertisers -- with a commemoration of its 75th anniversary that is focused as much on the present and future as the past.
The magazine is Woman's Day, which began in 1931 as a menu sheet given to shoppers at supermarkets owned by the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company. In 1937, the freebie was expanded into a magazine, priced at 2 cents a copy, and sold only at A.& P. stores. Five owners, seven and a half decades and innumerable technologies later, Woman's Day is now published by the Hearst Magazines division of the Hearst Corporation in New York and available, as the saying goes, wherever magazines are sold (at $2.99 a copy). 
Woman's Day has been marking the anniversary throughout the year with editorial content like gatefolds that revisit 75 years of tips on topics like beauty, decorating and reducing stress. The October issue is designated as the anniversary issue, featuring a $100,000 sweepstakes and articles like ''Eight Classic Recipes, Updated,'' for dishes that include pork chop suey and pineapple upside-down cake, and ''Beautiful Together,'' about makeovers for three generations of readers from one family.
A free anniversary event is planned for Oct. 5, in Vanderbilt Hall in Grand Central Terminal, offering cooking and craft demonstrations; advice from experts in beauty, style and entertaining; free samples; and appearances by Woman's Day editors.
Marketers have joined in the yearlong celebration by, for instance, sponsoring the anniversary event and gatefolds and including Microsoft Tag bar codes in some ad pages they are buying in the October issue, giving readers additional chances to win prizes. Those marketers include the American Egg Board, Colgate-Palmolive, JetBlue, Kellogg (Special K), L'Oral (Garnier), Mylan (EpiPen), Silpada Designs, Stainmaster and UnitedHealthcare.
Woman's Day is only one of many long-running brands to celebrate milestone anniversaries this year. Others include Cartier, 165; Cond Nast Traveler magazine, 25; GMC trucks, 100; Life Savers, 100; and Oreo cookies, 100.
Elaborate anniversary observances are part of a trend on Madison Avenue called comfort marketing, using nostalgia to woo consumers during uncertain economic times.
''Woman's Day is an iconic brand,'' said Ginger Sutton, vice president, publisher and chief revenue officer of the magazine, and ''readers love seeing a tip from 1942 that still makes sense for their lives today.''
A related trend involves what is known as authenticity: encouraging shoppers to perceive venerable brands as worth buying because withstanding the test of time connotes value.
''Readers see the magazine as a source of trusted information,'' said Susan Spencer, editor in chief. ''They tell us, 'I read it and my mother read it, and still reads it.' ''
Still, there is a sense, particularly for print media, that brand stewards must strive for, as Ms. Spencer put it, ''a delicate balance, without question'' -- capitalizing on longevity without coming off as too long in the tooth to be contemporary.
''So we talk about relevance,'' Ms. Sutton said, ''and decided not to do a look backward'' in the anniversary issue. For example, there are no reprints of vintage covers, articles or ads.
''Print is still vital, and here to stay,'' Ms. Sutton said. ''Is it shifting? Yes. Do we need to adapt to that? Yes, it's what we do as editors and publishers.''
So Woman's Day reduced the frequency of its print edition to 12 issues a year, from 15, while making itself available online as well as on mobile devices and tablets. It has newsletters, too, and a presence in social media like Facebook, Google Plus, Pinterest and Twitter.
''People haven't abandoned the traditional media, but they've added a lot of other technologies, new sources, for information,'' said Diane E. Slayton, vice president for member acquisition and retention marketing at UnitedHealthcare in Minnetonka, Minn., which is a sponsor of the Oct. 5 event and is running ads in the February, May, August and November issues of the magazine.
Woman's Day is ''a way to reach our audience that's very effective,'' she added, because ''our target of women, the 'chief health officers' of the family, is still reading magazines.''
Woman's Day is one of six so-called women's service magazines, along with two others owned by Hearst, Good Housekeeping and Redbook, and three owned by the Meredith Corporation: Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle and Ladies' Home Journal. With McCall's, which became Rosie in 2001 and was closed a year later, they were known as the Seven Sisters.
That six are still publishing articles for tens of millions of American women like those promoted on the cover of the October Woman's Day -- ''Fall Comfort Food,'' ''Work-at-Home Jobs That Pay Good Money'' and ''Halloween Fun!'' -- may be more surprising than if, say, the Halloween article suggested that readers go trick-or-treating as Lady Gaga.
''Woman's Day is a brand that has empowered women for 75 years, shaping the lives of our mothers and grandmothers and great-grandmothers,'' said Cori Kallenbach, director for communications at Silpada Designs in Lenexa, Kan., which was started 60 years after the first issue of Woman's Day was published.
''There's a lot of trust in Woman's Day, and that trust is a big thing,'' Ms. Kallenbach added. ''You want to partner with companies that are established.''

HEADLINE: New Territory for Ads, With a Moving Target

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
In the next month or two, subway and bus riders will find advertising where they have never seen it before: on the face of their MetroCards, always with them and inescapable - at least for that moment they pay their fare.
The front of the MetroCard is not the only new territory being given over to commerce. This year, for the first time, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority began allowing ads to cover passenger windows on buses. Calvin Klein and Broadway producers embraced the spot.
At the same time, interactive digital advertising has arrived on an immense scale. Along 60 feet of a mezzanine corridor at the Columbus Circle station, those so inclined could either try to outrun an image of Ryan Hall, courtesy of Asics, or try to play fetch with a virtual dog, courtesy of the dog food company Beneful.
Then there are naming rights: for $200,000 a year, the authority has added the designation "Barclays Center" to the name of the Atlantic Avenue stations in Brooklyn. The measure is one part customer service - the new arena by that name is a block away - and two parts marketing, as the arena and stations now carry the name of a giant international financial services company. 
Commercial marketing has been interwoven with transit since early days: car cards, wall posters, even naming rights. (The station at Broadway and 42nd Street was named for a private company, The New York Times, even before the first trains rolled in 1904.)
Now, as new digital information systems are introduced, ads are coming along with them.
It is a big business. This year, the authority expects to receive $120 million from advertising in the subway, on buses, on its two commuter railroads and on billboards along its routes. Its spokesman Aaron Donovan said this compared with $106 million in 2007 and $38 million in 1997.
"In the midst of a recession that has battered the advertising sector, our advertising revenue has increased significantly over the past five years," Mr. Donovan said, "in part through the use of innovative digital technologies that we've welcomed into the system."
In an overall annual operating budget of $13.1 billion, advertising revenue pays almost 1 percent of the costs. About half of that revenue comes from a single contract, with CBS Outdoor, for subway-related advertising. This year, CBS paid the authority $61.8 million. The 10-year contract, which expires in 2015, has an overall minimum guaranteed value of $580 million. Payments may even be higher if business is especially good.
CBS Outdoor said through a spokeswoman, Jodi Senese, that the growth in ad sales could be traced to increased ridership, new formats that "pique advertiser interest in the medium generally" and the "constriction of other 'out-of-home' opportunities," like advertisements on sidewalk scaffolding.
No transit system can afford to leave money on the table, said Art Guzzetti, the vice president for policy at the American Public Transportation Association in Washington. "We're growing in ridership, but revenues have not grown," he said in a telephone interview. "We're strapped for revenues, and have to turn over every rock."
For that reason, Gene Russianoff of the riders' advocacy group Straphangers Campaign, said he was reluctant to criticize the increasingly aggressive search by the transportation authority for nongovernment financing. "They're doing what they've been asked to do," he said, "and it's hard to fault them."
But revenues come with a cost of their own, suggested Siva Vaidhyanathan, the chairman of the media studies department at the University of Virginia.
"We've gotten to the point now where the M.T.A. doesn't respect its own environment and is filling it with sight pollution," he said in a phone interview. "A bright yellow subway car, branded to sell something, is not comfortable, it's not respectful and it's not dignified."
"Environmentally, the city should be paying attention to dignity as a quality-of-life indicator," Professor Vaidhyanathan said.
There are restraints, it turns out. Transportation officials will not permit city buses to be fully wrapped in advertising, in part because no one - including police officers - can clearly see what is going on behind windows covered in vinyl sheets. The new exterior ads, called "L-sides," are limited to a single window on one side of a bus: 20.5 square feet of glass.
The product used by CBS Outdoor, Contra Vision, is described as see-through. But it might be likened to a very fine colander. In both cases, one is looking through a field of small perforations.
In a joint statement, the transportation authority and CBS said they did not believe that "placing Contra Vision on a single window compromises the passenger experience in any material way."
"If a particular passenger prefers an entirely unobstructed view, there are plenty of windows to chose from," they said. "The M.T.A.'s customers have never hesitated to voice concerns with respect to the advertising that appears on its buses, yet the M.T.A. has not to date received a single complaint about this ad medium."
Since 2003, the authority has allowed the shuttle and a few other subway trains to be wrapped, though windows may not be covered. Occasionally, advertisers will also install up to six "video car cards" with 11-inch screens (measured diagonally) in each car. These play silent visual loops. Audio is not an option.
The authority "would like to see more of this kind of thing," Mr. Donovan said, "and is open to the introduction of digital media in a variety of formats throughout the system."
There are now 100 "urban panels" at subway entrances, with digital screens on both sides. (A year ago, there were 80 one-sided panels.) The side facing the stairs can show updated transit information at the bottom of the screen. A traveler reading the screen might learn of delays on the Seventh Avenue line, for example, and decide instead to take an Eighth Avenue train. The outward-facing side shows 15-second commercials on a 55-inch screen.
More screens are coming. In a pilot program called On the Go, the authority placed free-standing, interactive kiosks in five subway stations last year. These carry status reports on subway, elevator and escalator service; large, legible subway maps that can be summoned by fingertip; and digital advertisements. The program is to be expanded, and Ms. Senese said CBS was "interested in the commercial potential of these screens."
Since its contract began in 2006, CBS Outdoor has introduced branded turnstile arms, usually as part of a larger station domination by a single advertiser; "stripes" running on the sides of Seventh Avenue, Lexington Avenue and shuttle trains; and "headliners" that stretch across the entire top of some buses, chiefly in Manhattan.
It tried and abandoned floor decals ("Foot traffic rendered them unattractive," Ms. Senese said) and digital ads projected on screens. It determined that the technology is not yet at hand to permit columns and walls to be wrapped in light-emitting material. Nor does it envision any "cross-track" ads; that is, panels placed in the track well that can be read by passengers standing on the opposite platform. "'Cross-track' is difficult to execute in a 24-hour system," Ms. Senese said.
Professor Vaidhyanathan, for one, would like to see some more restraint. He bristled at the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center name. "What happens if Barclays is convicted of massive fraud in the Libor scandal?" he asked. "What happens if Barclays goes out of business?"
Alternately, however, what if the bank and the new name show some staying power? After all, "Times Square" seems to have caught on.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Beijing Mixes Messages Over Anti-Japan Protests

BYLINE: By IAN JOHNSON and THOM SHANKER; Ian Johnson reported from Beijing, and Thom Shanker from Tokyo.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Anti-Japanese demonstrators took to the streets again on Sunday in cities across China, with the government offering mixed signals on whether it would continue to tolerate the sometimes violent outbursts.
The protests were orderly in Beijing, with several hundred people circling in front of the Japanese Embassy demanding Chinese control over a small island group known as Senkaku in Japan and as Diaoyu in China. Protests were also reported in other cities, including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao.
On Saturday, protests occurred in more than 50 cities, with some violence reported. A factory for the Panasonic Corporation was set on fire in Qingdao, and a Toyota dealership was looted, according to photographs posted on social media sites and local residents reached by telephone. 
''Across China, calls have grown for boycotts of Japanese products. Many Japanese retailers and restaurants have been forced to place signs in their windows supporting China, and on Sunday, Japan's prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, asked China to protect Japanese and their property.
A signed editorial on the Web site of People's Daily, the authoritative Communist Party newspaper, said the protests should be viewed sympathetically. While it did not defend the violence, the editorial said the protests were a symbol of the Chinese people's patriotism.
''No one would doubt the pulses of patriotic fervor when the motherland is bullied,'' the editorial said. ''No one would fail to understand the compatriots' hatred and fights when the country is provoked; because a people that has no guts and courage is doomed to be bullied, and a country that always hides low and bides its time will always come under attack.''
Some articles in the Chinese news media, however, said the protests should be ''rational'' and peaceful.
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta is scheduled to visit Beijing on Monday, and some observers said the government might try to limit the protests.
Just before landing in Tokyo on Sunday, Mr. Panetta told correspondents aboard his jet that he was worried that territorial disputes in the Pacific raise ''the possibility that a misjudgment on one side or the other could result in violence.''
Mr. Panetta said the United States was not taking sides in any of the region's territorial disagreements, but advocated diplomacy to peacefully resolve them. One option, he said, would be for the feuding nations to follow a code of conduct advocated by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Both China and Japan claim the disputed islands, although Japan has controlled them for over a century. China increased its pressure on Japan after the Japanese government purchased the islands from private owners. Japan says the move was to prevent nationalists from using the islands, but China has seen it as a step to solidify Japanese control. In response, China dispatched surveillance ships to the waters near the islands.
Complicating the diplomatic dispute, Japan's newly appointed ambassador to China, Shinichi Nishimiya, died Sunday after falling ill last week in Tokyo, according to Japanese and Chinese news reports. He was appointed ambassador last week and was to assume his duties next month.
China's state-run news media has made repeated calls for the islands to be given to China, which claims that it controlled them before Japan's colonial expansion in the late 19th century. Both China and Japan are also involved in territorial disputes with other countries over separate island chains, some of which are thought to be surrounded by rich deposits of natural resources in the surrounding waters.
There was evidence on Sunday that some Chinese government officials were involved in the protests. In the western city of Xi'an, activists on the Internet identified one of the officials as the police chief.
The political analyst Li Weidong said the official tolerance fit a longstanding pattern of behavior in which the Chinese government uses mass protests to further its foreign policy goals. In a text message sent to friends and associates, Mr. Li compared the current protesters to the Boxers, a quasi-religious group that was used by the Qing dynasty to oppose foreign incursions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
''Beijing dares not to fight, but it's unable to talk it over either,'' Mr. Li wrote. ''So it has to employ Boxers, using product boycott to press Japan.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Earnings Are Beginning To Feel a Pinch

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The boom in American corporate profits, which has far outpaced the gains in the broader economy since the end of the last recession, is faltering.
Giants like FedEx and Intel, two bellwethers of the global economy, are warning of lower quarterly profits because of weakness in worldwide demand. Overseas companies are feeling the pinch, too. Burberry, the British luxury retailer which had seemed immune to a slowdown, is offering a similar warning.
Even smaller, family-owned companies like Eastman Machine in Buffalo, which makes cutting equipment for the textile industry, are wary. ''We feel like we are walking on a tightrope,'' said Robert Stevenson, Eastman Machine's chief executive.
In all, Wall Street expects quarterly profits at the typical large American company to decline for the first time since 2009. 
The causes of the expected decline are many. In addition to the anemic economy in the United States, much of Europe has fallen into recession while growth in China, once white-hot, has slowed. There is also the looming prospect of automatic tax increases and spending cuts in Washington, which has caused companies to sit on the sidelines.
After reducing spending and eliminating jobs during the recession, American companies reaped huge gains by keeping expenses down and putting off aggressively hiring new workers as growth slowly returned. Strong profits have also propelled the stock market higher, reassuring investors whose other assets, like real estate, have declined in value over the same period.
But while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index on Friday reached its highest close since 2007 -- after the Federal Reserve's announcement of its latest stimulus effort -- the cycle of steady earnings increases appears to have run its course.
''A lot of the profit gain you had in the last few years was a bounce from the recession and a result of very aggressive cost-cutting,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ''Those factors are going to be very hard to replicate.''
The expected decline in profits has yet to set off big layoffs. But it is another factor that is inhibiting hiring and keeping unemployment above the politically important level of 8 percent, executives and economists say.
Last week, the Federal Reserve announced its boldest effort yet to kick-start growth and confront persistently high unemployment. The next day, the government reported that industrial production in August fell 1.2 percent, the biggest monthly contraction since March 2009.
While executives welcomed the Fed's announcement, many express concern over just how much impact it will have.
Just over half of managers at North American companies now expect production levels to increase in the next 12 months, down from 64 percent in the second quarter, according to a survey by CEB, a member-based advisory firm. In the same survey, the percentage of executives who expect to hire more workers fell to 34 percent from 41 percent last quarter.
''We're sort of like in this limbo environment,'' said Gregory T. Swienton, chief executive of Ryder System, the truck rental and transportation company. ''I'd love to be able to say we're hiring, but there is no natural big growth that would require hiring.''
The slowdown overseas is beginning to cut into profits at both large and small companies, many of which had benefited in the last few years from heightened demand abroad even as growth in the United States slowed.
At Eastman Machine in Buffalo, orders from China and Europe are below last year's levels, said Mr. Stevenson, the chief executive. Business has held up better domestically, and Mr. Stevenson says he is optimistic about the future of his family-owned company over the long haul.
Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the typical company in the S.& P. 500 to decline 2.2 percent in the third quarter from the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters, the first such drop since the third quarter of 2009. Earnings are expected slide 3 percent from the second quarter of 2012.
What is more, 88 companies have already said that results will come in below expectations; 21 that have signaled a positive outlook, said Greg Harrison, corporate earnings research analyst at Thomson Reuters.
''That's much more pessimistic than normal,'' said Mr. Harrison, who added that the third quarter of 2001 was the last time that earnings guidance leaned so heavily to the downside.
To be sure, pockets of optimism remain. In addition to the stock market rally this month, corporate earnings are still expected to finish 2012 up 6.1 percent from 2011, largely because gains in the first half of the year will offset any decline in the third quarter. And earnings results in the fourth quarter could benefit from a slowdown late last year, making make year-over-year comparisons look better.
Looking ahead, if corporate profits enter a sustained decline, big companies are likely to face increased pressure to cut jobs, since there is much less room left to cut costs elsewhere.
After rising steadily in the wake of the recession, profit margins for S.& P. 500 companies peaked at 8.9 percent in late 2011, said David Kostin, chief United States equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. Margins are expected to fall to 8.7 percent in 2012.
Indeed, margins are eroding at some companies as revenue dips. Intel said this month that it estimated revenue for the third quarter would total $13.2 billion, plus or minus $300 million. That is off from an earlier forecast of $13.8 billion to $14.8 billion, and 7 percent below revenue a year ago. Profit margins are estimated at 62 percent, down from 63.4 percent a year ago.
Wall Street estimates that Intel will earn about $2.58 billion in the third quarter, a 26 percent drop from the same quarter a year ago. The company, which makes semiconductors, has been hurt as computer makers cut chip inventories in Asia, while demand for personal computers has been soft worldwide.
At FedEx, which warned of lower-than-expected results on Sept. 4, profits in the current quarter are projected to decline by 2 to 6 percent. When the company reports earnings Tuesday, analysts will watch closely for weakness in shipments in China and the United States, two major markets that have been softer than originally forecast.
While profit margins have plateaued in corporate America, productivity gains in the overall economy have ebbed as well. After rising at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in 2009, and a 3.1 percent pace in 2010, productivity inched up 0.7 percent in 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
''There's only so much you can cut,'' said Chad Moutray, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.

HEADLINE: A Crash Business Course for Artistic Types

BYLINE: By D.D. GUTTENPLAN

 BODY:
LONDON -- Gregory Thompson, president and C.E.O. -- as well as chief cook, taster and marketing director -- of Shakespeare's Sauces, found his inspiration while walking to the British Library.
Mr. Thompson, who had directed theater productions at the Royal Shakespeare Company in Britain and the Kennedy Center in Washington, was on his way to research ''King John'' and ''thinking about the fact that while we know Shakespeare didn't go to university, his plays are full of the books he read. And they are full of references to food and drink.''
''His period, the Elizabethan era, is also the first time we have a number of printed cookbooks in English,'' he said. ''So I suddenly found myself wondering: 'Can I use sauces to tell people about the sources?'''
He hopes to retail his Shakespeare-themed sauces at shops and supermarkets. 
Last week Mr. Thompson and about 90 other fledgling entrepreneurs went through three days of ''boot camp'' at the School for Creative Startups , a social enterprise whose yearlong program is designed to teach artists, designers and artisans how to set up and run successful businesses in order to make a living from their craft.
Jessica Huie's company, Colorblind Cards, was born when her 7-year-old daughter Monet ''was going through a princess'' phase.
''I was looking for a birthday card for her and all the princesses were blond, with straight hair,'' she said. ''There was a complete lack of anything reflective of the reality of London as a multicultural city. So I started to make my own, and within seven months we were in Clintons,'' a British retailer.
Five years later, Ms. Huie's company has spread her message -- ''The only thing that should be separated by color is laundry'' -- to the United States and South Africa, but she still is not making enough to quit her day job.
Andy Heller, currently the sole employee of Catered, a business that delivers a recipe for a meal plus all the ingredients needed to prepare it in a single box, said his new business started just as his old business went bankrupt.
''This has been one of the worst few weeks in my life,'' he said. ''Last Tuesday I decided to liquidate my company. At the end of the week a huge bottle of oil broke and soaked the back of my car. Now I'm here hoping for a new start.''
The school is headed by Doug Richard, an American-born entrepreneur and investor best known in Britain for his two years on the BBC television program ''Dragon's Den.'' (The U.S. version is ''Shark Tank.'')
''The creative industries in Britain are one of the few vibrant sectors in the economy,'' he said during a brief break from the stage at London's Conway Hall, where, under a proscenium arch inscribed ''To Thine Own Self Be True,'' Mr. Richard preached a gospel of salvation through work, as well as a close study of the market.
''The poor don't buy pretty. They can't afford it,'' he said, urging producers of luxury goods like handbags or jewelry to match their sales pitches and Web sites to their target audience.
Why would a one-woman operation selling luxury children's pajamas in traditional cotton prints need a Web site?
''You can be small and global,'' Mr. Richard told the students. ''The Web changes everything.''
''There is a desire by government to drive forward entrepreneurship,'' said Mr. Richard, who was recently asked by the government to lead a review of apprenticeships in Britain. ''But all their effort has been devoted to high-tech. It seems silly to want to copy Silicon Valley when we already are the Silicon Valley of the creative industries.''
Fewer than half of those who apply to the school are accepted. And though a few of the wealthier students pay the full 3,000, or about $4,800, cost of tuition, roughly 90 percent pay only 600. In return, students get 10 full days of instruction by Mr. Richard and experts in the fields of planning, production, marketing and distribution, including special sessions on how to price work and attract investors.
During their second term, students get access to ''titans of industry'' to help mentor them. These include prominent supporters of the school like Luke Johnson, former chairman of Channel Four; the fashion designer Paul Smith; Nathalie Massanet, founder of the online retailer Net-A-Porter ; and Matthew Slotover, co-founder of the Frieze art fairs.
They also benefit from Mr. Richard's abundant, frequently profane, advice on everything from men's wear -- he's a fan of Hiut jeans, which he wears with bright French-cuff shirts -- to the perils of dealing with small retailers.
''Small retailers suck at paying their bills because they're all being hosed by rich landlords,'' he said.
The school, now in its second year, was originally funded entirely by Mr. Richard, who started and sold a series of software companies in the United States before moving to Britain in 2002. Current funding comes from other, for-profit Schools for Startups, from corporate sponsors and from a group of ''angels.''
''Besides helping us to do good, they get first-look rights at any of the businesses that start here,'' Mr. Richard said. However, graduates are under no obligation to allow Mr. Richard or anyone else to invest. Indeed, one of Mr. Richard's lessons is that, while all businesses need capital to grow, outside investors should be regarded warily.
For Miles Campbell , a refugee from the corporate world who ''stumbled across the school on Twitter,'' the boot camp was a crash course in turning a passion into a business. Mr. Campbell is a clock maker who hopes to sell his work to collectors. But with each clock taking many months to complete, he was having trouble deciding on what to charge -- or who might buy them. ''I can make a clock. I can design a clock. But I can't take it to market,'' he said.
Pia Townsend, a letterpress printer who sells her work online, said she thought the course ''would be good to help me get to the next stage without taking all the wrong turns and making all the mistakes I might otherwise make.''
Kelly Brown, who runs a company managing trips and events for corporate clients, hopes the course ''will give me more confidence in negotiating with clients.''
''I didn't go to university, and this is a quick way to learn more about business,'' she said.
Frankie Snobel is still supporting herself as a freelance journalist. But she hopes to use her skills and experience as a bartender to start a business selling cocktail-themed gift baskets.
As the students practiced their ''elevator pitches'' -- 30-second descriptions of their businesses targeted at potential investors -- the school's creative director, Medeia Cohan-Petrolino, acknowledged that not all graduates were likely to realize their dreams.
''I think it's like sex education,'' she said. ''Not everybody is ready to have sex when they take sex ed. Not everybody here is ready to go commercial. But when they are ready, they'll be better prepared.''
''I'm not going to go hungry tonight,'' Mr. Richard said of his motivations. ''But I'm still ambitious. I want to be on the cover of The Economist as the man who moves the G.D.P. of nations.''

HEADLINE: As Grocery Dies Off, Down-and-Out Town Lives On, if Barely

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
MENDOTA, Calif. -- Westside Grocery, serving this self-described Cantaloupe Center of the World since the 1940s, removed its gasoline pumps around 1980, the result of increased regulation. Fresh steaks and pork chops went by the wayside in the 1990s: too few could afford them.
Fresh milk was the next casualty. No one ever seemed to hurt for money for beer, but Westside Grocery eventually stopped selling that, too. ''Too many alcoholics stinking of urine and worse,'' said Joseph Riofrio, who took over the business from his father, who had taken it over from his. ''But the truth is that the electricity for the cooler was getting expensive.''
Now Westside Grocery is gone. Last month, Mr. Riofrio, a City Council member and former mayor of this Central Valley town, where a street is named after his grandfather, pulled the plug -- done in by a 38.7 percent unemployment rate, the foreclosure and credit crises and hoped-for economic help that never came. ''How can a community in the heart of the most abundant farmland on earth suffer this way?'' Mr. Riofrio said, fighting back tears. 
Another question: If Mr. Riofrio, 50, cannot make it here, can anyone?
The Detroit of California. The Appalachia of the West. This town of 11,100 has been called both, and it is not an exaggeration. About half of Mendota's residents, according to city officials, live below the poverty line. Alcohol abuse is unbridled. A recent killing appeared to be tied to the violent street gang MS-13.
Mendota has garbage collection, but you would not know it from looking at some of the front yards along Juanita Street. A squalid trailer park greets people arriving from Fresno, about 35 miles to the east; to the south is a prison, built in a former cotton field. Shopping is mostly done at Dollar City or the 99 Cents Store, both competitors of the 98 Cents Store.
Although Mendota is in especially bad shape, the entire Central Valley has been hit hard by the recession and sluggish recovery. Unemployment for the region is about 15 percent. Stockton, on the valley's northern end, filed for bankruptcy protection in June. A homeless camp continues to grow at a Fresno exit along Route 99. Bakersfield, to the south, has perked up lately, but it has something the rest of the valley does not: oil and natural gas fields and proximity to Los Angeles.
Unemployment has long been a reality in Mendota, which was first settled in the 1890s as a railroad stop. California's agricultural towns rise and fall depending on what crop needs picking and how much water is available for irrigation. Social problems are nothing new, either. ''The fields have always been a magnet for impoverished people trying to find a way out,'' said Rick Wartzman, the executive director of the Drucker Institute at Claremont Graduate University and the author of several books examining the Central Valley.
Still, Mendota's unemployment rate is high even by farming community standards, which typically see a seasonal average of about 20 percent. As the worst of the worst, Mendota has gotten its share of attention over the years; in 2009, when Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger needed a backdrop to announce that he had petitioned President Obama to declare Fresno County a drought disaster area, he chose Mendota.
But nothing ever seems to get better here. That disaster request was declined. Thousands of acres of surrounding farmland -- once used to grow corn, bell peppers, tomatoes and melons -- have been forced out of production because of salt buildup, the result of flawed irrigation and drainage systems. Thousands of additional acres have been left fallow because of a lack of water. This part of the Central Valley relies almost exclusively on federal irrigation supplies that have been curtailed amid environmentalist pressure to restore fish habitat.
''There is more than one root problem, which is what makes Mendota so tricky to deal with,'' Mr. Wartzman said. ''Immigration, water politics, labor patterns, the tendency for California to forget its middle, farm legislation -- it all contributes to the downward spiral.''
Faced with vanishing farm jobs and the shuttering of related businesses, like a box-folding plant and the Spreckels sugar factory, Mendota has worked to lure prison builders, a frequent solution for struggling rural communities.
A for-profit prison company started construction on a facility but stopped, saying it had overextended itself. A 1,152-inmate federal prison opened here last year, but the expected jobs have yet to materialize. About half of the workers have been transferred from other facilities, and most of the jobs that are available require a college degree; fewer than 31 percent of Mendota residents have even graduated from high school, according to census data.
Westside Grocery, a caramel-colored building topped with a 7Up sign, stands at the corner of Stamoules and Seventh Streets. In recent years, Mr. Riofrio sold snacks, dry goods, cold medications and hardware items like work gloves. He extended credit, with some accounts allowed $600. Mr. Riofrio also served as a type of amateur pharmacist and translator, helping Spanish-speaking immigrants read their utility bills.
But on Aug. 10, ''as the heat was approaching 111 and I sat alone in my store, I knew that the buck had finally stopped,'' he said.
Mr. Riofrio locked the front door and went home. ''He walked in the house at 1 p.m. and just kept repeating, 'I'm done,' '' said his wife, Paula Riofrio. ''I said: 'Done? With what? Joe, talk to me.' ''
Mendota will not be left without a place to buy groceries. Bodegas are plentiful -- mostly because they sell cheap beer: $1.49 for a 32-ounce Miller High Life -- and a bigger supermarket remains. But another piece of the town's already threadbare fabric is gone.

Early this month, customers were still dropping by Mr. Riofrio's store. A few hoped he had had a change of heart. Some, like Mayra Pantoja, had not heard the news. Ms. Pantoja, holding a baby and trailing two young children, walked up to pay her Dish television bill. ''It's gone? How can that be?'' she said.
Her daughter pointed to a sign on the door: ''Cerrado. Closed. Gracias.''

HEADLINE: Canada Auto Workers Chief Renews Threat Strike

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OTTAWA -- Despite making progress with the Ford Motor Company of Canada during contract talks over the weekend, Ken Lewenza, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, renewed his threat on Sunday to strike all three Detroit automakers.
Mr. Lewenza told a news conference that the union would now concentrate its efforts on negotiating a deal with Ford, which it hopes to present to the Canadian branches of General Motors and Chrysler before the strike deadline of 11:59 p.m. on Monday. 
But he added that if no agreement was signed or close to resolution at that time, the union may start three simultaneous strikes. Such a step would be unprecedented for the Canadian union, which normally selects just a single company as its strike target.
Canada's manufacturing sector is disproportionately dependent on Detroit's automakers, as well as Honda and Toyota. The loss of production at the three companies' plants, with the exception of a factory G.M. owns that operates under a separate contract, could have a significant impact on the country's economy.
Mark Hopkins, an economist with Moody's Analytics, wrote in an analysis published on Friday that auto-related companies contributed about three-quarters of the growth in Canada's manufacturing sector over the 12 months leading to June.
''Stalling this momentum, even temporarily, would be costly,'' Mr. Hopkins wrote.
Exactly what changed between the union and Ford at the negotiations, which began about a month ago, is not clear.
''Ford has been a respectful company the last couple of days,'' Mr. Lewenza said. ''But they're still a tough company.''
It appears that the breakthrough may be related to an issue that is dividing all three of the companies and the union. Looking to reduce costs, the automakers want to mirror contracts they have in the United States that pay lower wages to newly hired employees. In Canada, new employees start at lower rate but gradually shift to the higher wage rate scale.
While the union has offered to extend the period of time during which new employees are paid less, Mr. Lewenza said that his union will not accept the two-tiered approach to pay.
''It's not just a philosophical problem,'' Mr. Lewenza said. ''I think it creates morale problems, I think it creates productivity problems.''
Stacey Allerton, vice president for human resources at Ford of Canada, said in a statement that ''we are confident that, working together, we can find innovative solutions to help build a successful future for our Canadian operations.''
The rise of the Canadian dollar to parity with the American dollar has reduced the usual cost advantage of Canadian auto plants and put pressure on the union to find cost savings for manufacturers. Even Mr. Lewenza acknowledged that labor costs are now higher in Canada because of the exchange rate.
Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of the Chrysler Group, threatened to withdraw the company from Canada during an interview with The Globe and Mail earlier this month.
''Nobody in their right mind would continue to create an unlevel playing field in its own organization,'' he told the Canadian national newspaper. ''It's impossible. We have other plants, other options.''
The remark set off some controversy in Canada because both the federal government and the province of Ontario contributed to Chrysler's bailout.
Chrysler Canada did not respond to a request for comment.
On Sunday, General Motors of Canada repeated its position that any contract must bring cost savings.
''We are focused on working with our C.A.W. partners to reach an agreement that will improve G.M. Canada's competitive position for the future, which is imperative in today's global marketplace,'' the company said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Beyond Obamacare

BYLINE: By STEVEN RATTNER. 
Steven Rattner, a contributing opinion writer, was a counselor to the Treasury secretary in the , Obama administration.

 BODY:
WE need death panels.
Well, maybe not death panels, exactly, but unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently -- rationing, by its proper name -- the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget.
But in the pantheon of toxic issues -- the famous ''third rails'' of American politics -- none stands taller than overtly acknowledging that elderly Americans are not entitled to every conceivable medical procedure or pharmaceutical.
Most notably, President Obama's estimable Affordable Care Act regrettably includes severe restrictions on any reduction in Medicare services or increase in fees to beneficiaries. In 2009, Sarah Palin's rant about death panels even forced elimination from the bill of a provision to offer end-of-life consultations. 
Now, three years on, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul D. Ryan, has offered his latest ambitious plan for addressing the Medicare problem. But like Mr. Obama's, it holds limited promise for containing the program's escalating costs within sensible boundaries.
The Obama and Ryan plans are not without common ground; both propose an identical formula for capping the growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary. And both dip into the same toolbox (particularly lower payments to providers) to achieve a reduction of nearly $1 trillion in Medicare expenditures over the next decade from projected levels.
That's where the agreement ends. Mr. Ryan believes that meeting the goal over the long term requires introducing more competition into Medicare through vouchers to purchase private insurance.
But Ryan's approach was rendered toothless when the issue's brutal politics forced him to retreat from his initial tough plan to simply cap the growth in government spending on Medicare and stick the inevitable overage onto beneficiaries. Under his revised plan, private insurers would be required to offer the same level of benefits as traditional Medicare, meaning that any savings would have to come from unidentified efficiencies (the ever-popular ''waste, fraud and abuse'').
If the cap was breached -- as it almost certainly would eventually be -- Mr. Ryan blithely says, ''Congress would be required to intervene.'' Fat chance; Congress regularly does the opposite when it rolls back caps on payments to doctors and hospitals.
Meanwhile, Mr. Obama's hopes for sustained cost containment are pinned on a to-be-determined mix of squeezing reimbursements, embracing a selection of the creative ideas that have spewed forth from health care policy wonks and scouring the globe for innovations.
To Mr. Obama's credit, his plan has more teeth than Mr. Ryan's; if his Independent Payment Advisory Board comes up with savings, Congress must accept either them or vote for an equivalent package. The problem is, the advisory board can't propose reducing benefits (a k a rationing) or raising fees (another form of rationing), without which the spending target looms impossibly large.
That's the view of the bipartisan Medicare trustees, whose 2012 report stated: ''Actual future Medicare expenditures are likely to exceed the intermediate projections shown in this report, possibly by quite large amounts.''
To be sure, health care cost increases have moderated, in part because of the recession and in part because Medicare has been tightening its reimbursements. But those thumbscrews can't be tightened forever; Medicare reimbursement rates are already well below those of private providers.
Let's not forget that with the elderly population growing rapidly, even if cost increases for each beneficiary can be contained, Medicare would still claim a rising share of the American economy.
Medicare needs to take a cue from Willie Sutton, who reportedly said he robbed banks because that's where the money was. The big money in Medicare is not to be found in Mr. Ryan's competition or Mr. Obama's innovation, but in reducing the cost of treating people in the last year of life, which consumes more than a quarter of the program's budget.
No one wants to lose an aging parent. And with price out of the equation, it's natural for patients and their families to try every treatment, regardless of expense or efficacy. But that imposes an enormous societal cost that few other nations have been willing to bear. Many countries whose health care systems are regularly extolled -- including Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- have systems for rationing care.
Take Britain, which provides universal coverage with spending at proportionately almost half of American levels. Its National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence uses a complex quality-adjusted life year system to put an explicit value (up to about $48,000 per year) on a treatment's ability to extend life.
At the least, the Independent Payment Advisory Board should be allowed to offer changes in services and costs. We may shrink from such stomach-wrenching choices, but they are inescapable.

HEADLINE: With Unpredictability Ahead, Seeking to Deliver a Disciplined Message

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
There is almost nothing more valuable to a presidential campaign than controlling the message.
President Obama and Mitt Romney have been struggling to do that. Last week's events in the Middle East forced both campaigns to improvise -- abandoning the economic playbook that the candidates had imagined using as Election Day neared.
October will be filled with debates that produce more surprising, unplanned moments, so message discipline will be difficult. The week ahead may be one of the last chances that the candidates have to shape the political debate to their advantage. Here are four important areas they need to focus on. 
MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS Both candidates are eager to seize control of the foreign policy narrative -- if events overseas permit.
For Mr. Romney, that means moving the conversation about the violence in Africa and the Middle East away from his initial statement and toward a broader criticism of the president's handling of the unsettled region. The Republican candidate and his allies may have that chance if the protests continue to spread, raising questions about the administration's overall policy there.
As president, Mr. Obama will face scrutiny that Mr. Romney will not. But Mr. Obama's position also gives him a more natural command of the situation as he communicates with world leaders, orders investigations and potentially responds militarily to the death of American diplomats in Libya. The president's remarks at a ceremony when the bodies arrived back in the United States clearly displayed the public-relations advantages of incumbency.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS Even as both men seek to shape the foreign policy narrative, they are well aware of the issues that concern most voters. Each campaign will want to use the week ahead to reframe the economic debate in ways more favorable to its candidate.
Mr. Romney is headed to Los Angeles on Monday and will be in the swing state of Florida later in the week. He has worked to caution voters about Mr. Obama, saying they should be ''forewarned'' that the president would continue his economic policies in a second term. That would not be moving ''forward,'' Mr. Romney says, making fun of Mr. Obama's campaign slogan.
Mr. Romney has also been pushing the ideas that Mr. Obama has been soft on China regarding trade and that the president cannot say the United States is better off now than when he took office. Expect more of the same.
Mr. Obama has pushed back on the ''better off'' question, and will probably continue to do so as he argues that Mr. Romney would take the country back to the policies of President George W. Bush. The president's team is also continuing to pressure Mr. Romney on the actions of his old company, Bain Capital, and his refusal to release more years of his personal tax returns.
THE DEBATES Part of controlling the message is avoiding making a critical mistake during the debates next month. That means setting aside plenty of time to practice and study in the coming week.
That may be harder for Mr. Obama, who must deal with the aftermath of the violence over the anti-Muslim film even as he campaigns. Mr. Obama is scheduled to be in New York on Tuesday and then in Virginia and Wisconsin later in the week. Debate preparation will have to be sandwiched in between.
Mr. Romney has never participated in a one-on-one presidential debate. And he has had his moments during the nominating contests when something he said made his campaign lose control of his message. (Recall the $10,000 bet he jokingly offered to Gov. Rick Perry of Texas.) Preparing for next month's debates will be critical for him.
FINANCING THE ADS Perhaps nothing is more important in controlling a campaign's message than having the money to run television ads. Both campaigns have abandoned public financing, forcing them to continue raising money during the final post-Labor Day push.
The president's trip to New York and Mr. Romney's visit to Texas this week are examples of the pressure that fund-raising is putting on both of the campaigns: Message discipline is not free.

HEADLINE: Mideast Unrest Intensifies Debate on U.S. Intervention in Syria

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH and HELENE COOPER; Robert F. Worth reported from Doha, and Helene Cooper from Washington.

 BODY:
DOHA, Qatar -- In recent weeks, the growing death toll in Syria pushed that country's civil war to the top of the Obama administration's agenda, with some Arab leaders pressing harder for a greater American role in toppling Syria's leader, Bashar al-Assad.
Then came the protests of the past week in the Middle East -- a vivid illustration that the United States' support for greater democracy in the Arab world during the past two years is no guarantee against the incendiary power of Islamist sentiment and anti-American rage.
The turmoil has only sharpened a painful quandary that had been largely overshadowed by the presidential campaign. Should the United States and its allies remain wary of toppling Mr. Assad, one of the region's last secular dictators, whose rule, however repressive, has kept the forces of populist Islam in check? Or do the protests underscore the risks of inaction, with a rapidly growing jihadi presence in Syria that is likely to further destabilize the entire region? 
Already, the attacks on American and European diplomatic posts, and especially the deaths of an ambassador and three other Americans in Libya, have roused calls in the United States for disengagement from the Arab world and its seemingly endless mayhem. That a shoddy 14-minute video lampooning the Prophet Muhammad can provoke such anger, some say, bodes poorly for any future investment in Arab democracy.
Yet those calls to disengage, some analysts say, threaten to eclipse the larger context in Syria, where rising sectarian bloodshed and a growing Al Qaeda presence on Israel's doorstep could, if left unchecked, prove far more damaging to American interests than the latest turmoil.
''You can see why the U.S. would want to disengage after what just happened in Cairo and Benghazi,'' said Salman Shaikh, the director of the Brookings Doha Center. ''But, in fact, the chaos and the Islamists we saw in Libya should be a warning to us about this policy of standing back. Syria could become far, far more dangerous than Libya for the United States and the region, and it's still not too late to make a difference.''
The death toll in Syria has sharply increased in recent weeks, with some estimates putting it at more than 23,000. Regional powers like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, which now provide a trickle of light weapons to the rebels, have made it clear that they will not play a more decisive role without American support.
At the same time, the increasingly sectarian nature of the conflict and the danger of becoming involved in a proxy war with Iran and Russia, which continue to provide military support to the Syrian government, have kept the Obama administration and its European allies cautious. Looming over any potential intervention is the specter of Iraq, where a sectarian civil war devastated the country in 2006 and 2007 despite a major American military presence.
One senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the attacks on American Embassies last week demonstrated the soundness of President Obama's approach, which involves providing humanitarian and logistical aid but not weapons to the rebels. Mr. Obama has been criticized by Republicans, including Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has advocated a military approach, and Mitt Romney, the party's presidential nominee, who proposes arming the opposition via intermediaries but not directly.
Any effort to intervene militarily in Syria would probably take place without the imprimatur of the United Nations Security Council, where Russia has consistently opposed it.
''These incidents will further give people pause because already our intelligence agencies have been telling us that amongst the Syrian opposition -- the people who we're supposed to support -- some of them are Al Qaeda affiliates,'' said Brian Katulis, a national security expert at the Center for American Progress, a research and advocacy organization with close ties to the Obama White House.
Adding to the complexity of the Syria issue is the connection with Iran and the debate in the United States and Israel over whether to use airstrikes to stop Iran's nuclear program. One argument for toppling Mr. Assad has been to weaken Tehran, which has depended on Syria as its lone Arab ally and conduit to Hezbollah and other anti-Israel groups. Iran's economy is already buckling under sanctions, and if Iran lost Syria's support, it might be more amenable to a compromise over its nuclear program, or so the theory goes.
But it is far from clear that Western intervention in Syria would succeed in ousting Iran, which has deep networks in the country and might prove more adept than any Western or Arab power at operating in a chaotic, post-Assad Syria.
Some proponents of intervention argue that it is likely to take place at some point, and that by then the United States and its allies will have fewer options. Mr. Obama has already said he would step in if Syria appeared ready to use chemical weapons, and a vastly increased death toll -- or the threat of genocidal attacks on one of Syria's religious or ethnic minorities -- would create much greater pressure to intervene. If the rebels succeed in toppling Mr. Assad on their own, the resulting chaos and power struggle would also create a strong incentive for intervention.
''The risk of not intervening is not just that you create greater operating room for jihadis,'' said Emile Hokayem, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. ''You also risk not having any allies on the ground the day after Assad falls,'' and no power to shore up moderates in the new Syria.
Apart from the question of intervention, the latest anti-American protests could influence the way the United States allocates the limited support it has been providing to the rebels fighting Mr. Assad's government.
''The focus so far has been on identifying rebel groups to support'' and weeding out the more Islamist elements, Mr. Hokayem said. ''You can be sure those categories are going to harden.''
Officials with the Free Syrian Army, the main rebel opposition group in Syria, have been in Washington calling for the United States and other nations to establish a partial no-fly zone over Syria.
Administration officials close to Mr. Obama say that while he remains opposed to military intervention in Syria, the events of the past week have not turned him away from any kind of engagement with the Syrian opposition.
Friends and associates of J. Christopher Stevens, the American ambassador killed during the attack in Benghazi, say the last thing that he would have wanted to see was the United States retreat from the Arab world, including Syria. Mr. Stevens was considered for a top post at the embassy in Damascus, the Syrian capital, before he decided to go to Libya.
''Chris believes, and would say, 'This takes a robust form of diplomacy that we're not good at because we're used to dealing with dictatorships,' '' said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''He knew there were risks. What I'm worried about is if Libya is used as an excuse for the United States to pull back from the region. The reality there has just changed, and the people now are a factor in these countries.''

HEADLINE: The Interests of Nations vs. The Union's

BYLINE: By HUGO DIXON | REUTERS

 BODY:
European integration tends to advance first with squabbling, then with fudge. Every country has its national interests to defend. Some politicians appreciate the need to create a strong entity that can compete effectively with the United States, China and other countries. But that imperative typically plays second fiddle to more parochial concerns, with the result that time is lost and suboptimal solutions are often chosen.
Amid the ''europhoria'' unleashed by the European Central Bank's bond-buying plan , it is easy to miss the immense challenges posed by two complex problems that have just landed on the desks of European leaders: the proposed merger of the French-German company European Aeronautic Defense & Space with BAE Systems of Britain; and a proposal for a single banking supervisor for the euro zone . 
The potential of a military and aerospace giant that could rival the U.S. company Boeing has been under discussion since at least 1997, when Tony Blair of Britain, Jacques Chirac of France and Helmut Kohl of Germany called on the industry to unify to compete better with the American company. London, Paris and Berlin are the main European players in this game because they have the major assets.
Since 1997, progress has been patchy. Airbus, previously an awkward French-German-British consortium, was gradually turned into a company wholly owned by EADS -- and EADS itself was created by the merger of Arospatiale of France and Dasa of Germany.
But Paris and Berlin insisted on a governance structure designed to balance their power rather than to promote an effective organization, and the early years at EADS were bedeviled by scandal. Moreover, BAE chose to stay out of European integration, instead merging with Marconi of Britain and choosing to acquire smaller rivals.
The cost of developing products like fighter aircraft is huge. The last major European initiative in this area, the Eurofighter, was developed through another suboptimal consortium. If Europe cannot get its act together, BAE could eventually find itself swept into the arms of a large U.S. group, and governments could ultimately be forced to buy American. Depending on another country, even a close ally, will not be their first choice, so there is a strategic benefit to creating a streamlined European aerospace group.
The best solution might be to merge EADS and BAE and to run the new group with commercial priorities. The politicians would have to abandon their right to decide who would manage it or where its factories and research centers would be. The most important interests of Britain, France and Germany could be protected by protecting their secrets and giving each government a veto over any takeover of the group.
The plan for the merger, which came to light last week , takes a big step in this direction. A complex shareholder pact, which balances French and German interests in EADS, would be scrapped. The private shareholders involved in that pact, the French media conglomerate Lagardre and the German automaker Daimler, are also expected eventually to sell their shares.
The snag is that Paris would keep a stake of about 9 percent, potentially letting it pull the strings from behind the scenes, and both London and Berlin seem worried about that. Germany might also be queasy about a plan, not yet announced, to place the merged company's military contracting headquarters in England and its civilian aerospace headquarters in France.
Even if these circles can be squared, Washington could cause further trouble. BAE has benefited from the special military relationship between London and Washington. If the U.S. concludes that the new European group is effectively controlled by Paris, with which relations are cooler, it may strengthen controls on U.S. activities that make them commercially unattractive.
It would be better if France sold out of the combined group and depoliticized it entirely. But that does not appear to be in the cards.
Now turn to the proposal for a single banking supervisor for the euro zone, for which the European Commission unveiled a blueprint last week. Again, the idea is sensible, albeit not a silver bullet. A centralized supervisor might be able to clean up the banking sector in places like Greece, Ireland and Spain. This could pave the way for struggling lenders to be recapitalized with euro zone money rather than national money. And that, in turn, could play a role in diminishing the euro crisis.
There are at least two major problems, however. First, Berlin does not want its local savings banks, or sparkassen, to be supervised by the E.C.B. This is largely a matter of protecting vested interests, as the savings banks are closely linked to local politicians. But such relationships are precisely what caused mayhem in Spain's savings banks, or cajas. It would be a bad precedent, if Germany were to cut a special deal merely because it is the biggest boy in the euro class.
Second, how to protect the interests of the 10 countries that are part of the European Union but that do not use the single currency? This is of particular concern for London, the financial capital of Europe. Under the proposal presented last week, the 17 European Union countries that use the euro would negotiate matters like technical rules for banking that cover the entire European Union. London could therefore find itself perpetually outvoted.
There may be ways of dodging these pitfalls. But, as with defense integration, politicians will need to keep their eye on the big picture, even as they defend their legitimate national interests. That has not always been their forte.

HEADLINE: What Is Romney's Tax Plan?

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In U.S. national politics, Republicans flourish when the focus is on tax cuts; they suffer when Medicare is the focus. It looks like it'll be different this year.
Mitt Romney has proposed huge tax cuts that principally benefit the wealthy, while refusing to say how he would pay for them by closing unspecified loopholes. This lacks credibility and may become one of the rare tax-cut promises that is a political loser.
On Medicare, Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, have put forth a plan that ultimately would turn the U.S. health insurance program for the elderly into a premium support, or voucher, program. Democrats are winning on this issue in Florida and elsewhere. 
There are two reasons this is no longer the third rail for Republicans. One, a counterattack charging, speciously, that President Barack Obama's health care program cuts benefits for Medicare recipients. The other is a general recognition that changes need to be made in the program and whatever the problems with the Romney-Ryan proposals, the president has ducked the issue.
On taxes, it's Mr. Romney who's ducking. He has proposed a tax cut of more than $4 trillion over 10 years, an across-the-board 20 percent reduction in individual income tax rates and the elimination of the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax and taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest for those earning less than $200,000. The corporate tax rate would come down to 25 percent from 35 percent.
He insists this can be achieved without raising revenue, by limiting tax preferences. He refuses to specify any. The candidate cites Republican experts like the Princeton University economist Harvey Rosen. However, Mr. Rosen says this is feasible if Mr. Romney eliminates the popular tax deductions for items like home mortgages and charitable contributions for those making more than $100,000 a year.
That's a nonstarter for many Republicans, even with the trade-off of lower rates.
Thus, most tax experts say the Romney plan is a mirage.
''You can't get enough base-broadening to finance his rate reductions,'' says Michael Graetz, a Columbia Law School professor who was a top tax official in President George H.W. Bush's Treasury Department. ''Romney says what he will do on tax cuts, but he's not prepared to say what he would do on the hard stuff.''
Moreover, Mr. Graetz asks, ''Do we believe that Mitt Romney will make tithes to the Mormon Church and other charitable outfits nondeductible?'' In the two years of tax returns Mr. Romney has released, he made $42.6 million and gave $7 million to charity, mostly to his Mormon Church.
Promises for a revenue-neutral plan in which the middle class and small businesses get a net tax cut suggest higher overall taxes for either the poor or the rich. The Romney campaign refuses to comment. Mr. Romney's tax problem is further compounded when he insists his plan wouldn't change the progressivity of the tax code. He cites Ronald Reagan's 1986 tax-reform bill and the recommendations of the 2010 Bowles-Simpson deficit-reduction panel as models for cutting tax rates and broadening the base in a nonregressive manner.
What Mr. Romney doesn't say is how this was achieved. Capital-gains taxes were increased and treated as ordinary income in both the 1986 Tax Reform Act and the Bowles-Simpson plan. Mr. Romney has ruled out any increase in those levies.
Many of Mr. Romney's proposed tax cuts benefit the wealthy, and tax experts say it would be exceedingly difficult to retain the current progressivity if higher capital-gains rates were taken off the table.
Moreover, Mr. Reagan financed the lower individual rates with sizable increases in corporate taxes, like the elimination of the investment tax credit. Mr. Romney wants to cut, not increase, corporate taxes.
Mr. Reagan and George W. Bush gained the upper hand in the tax debate with promises of big cuts. Neither talked about any offsetting revenue increases.
A simple look at the budget deficit explains why the situation was different then. In 1980, the U.S. deficit was $60 billion; the public was frustrated about stagflation, a stagnant economy with soaring prices.
Twelve years ago, the second President Bush promised a tax cut because his predecessor, President Bill Clinton, left him a $240 billion budget surplus.
The deficit is projected to reach $1.3 trillion this year, and this is a centerpiece of the Romney-Ryan attack on Mr. Obama's economic performance.
Research by Democrats shows that undecided or persuadable voters -- disproportionately white, younger and not college-educated -- are turned off by what they see as the unfairness of the Romney tax plan. A current Obama ad charges the Republican would increase taxes on the middle class by $2,000 to pay for a tax cut for millionaires. While this is conjecture, the Romney camp has no specifics to refute it.
Democrats are plotting ways to accentuate the lack of transparency in Mr. Romney's plan. One notion is to tie it to his refusal to release more than a few years of his own tax returns with the charge: He won't tell you what he paid, or what you're going to pay.

HEADLINE: Hating On Ben Bernanke

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Last week Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, announced a change in his institution's recession-fighting strategies. In so doing he seemed to be responding to the arguments of critics who have said the Fed can and should be doing more. And Republicans went wild.
Now, many people on the right have long been obsessed with the notion that we'll be facing runaway inflation any day now. The surprise was how readily Mitt Romney joined in the craziness. 
So what did Mr. Bernanke announce, and why?
The Fed normally responds to a weak economy by buying short-term U.S. government debt from banks. This adds to bank reserves; the banks go out and lend more; and the economy perks up.
Unfortunately, the scale of the financial crisis, which left behind a huge overhang of consumer debt, depressed the economy so severely that the usual channels of monetary policy don't work. The Fed can bulk up bank reserves, but the banks have little incentive to lend the money out, because short-term interest rates are near zero. So the reserves just sit there.
The Fed's response to this problem has been ''quantitative easing,'' a confusing term for buying assets other than Treasury bills, such as long-term U.S. debt. The hope has been that such purchases will drive down the cost of borrowing, and boost the economy even though conventional monetary policy has reached its limit.
Sure enough, last week's Fed announcement included another round of quantitative easing, this time involving mortgage-backed securities. The big news, however, was the Fed's declaration that ''a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.'' In plain English, the Fed is more or less promising that it won't start raising interest rates as soon as the economy looks better, that it will hold off until the economy is actually booming and (perhaps) until inflation has gone significantly higher.
The idea here is that by indicating its willingness to let the economy rip for a while, the Fed can encourage more private-sector spending right away. Potential home buyers will be encouraged by the prospect of moderately higher inflation that will make their debt easier to repay; corporations will be encouraged by the prospect of higher future sales; stocks will rise, increasing wealth, and the dollar will fall, making U.S. exports more competitive.
This is very much the kind of action Fed critics have advocated -- and that Mr. Bernanke himself used to advocate before he became Fed chairman. True, it's a lot less explicit than the critics would have liked. But it's still a welcome move, although far from being a panacea for the economy's troubles (a point Mr. Bernanke himself emphasized).
And Republicans, as I said, have gone wild, with Mr. Romney joining in the craziness. His campaign issued a news release denouncing the Fed's move as giving the economy an ''artificial'' boost -- he later described it as a ''sugar high'' -- and declaring that ''we should be creating wealth, not printing dollars.''
Mr. Romney's language echoed that of the ''liquidationists'' of the 1930s, who argued against doing anything to mitigate the Great Depression. Until recently, the verdict on liquidationism seemed clear: it has been rejected and ridiculed not just by liberals and Keynesians but by conservatives too, including none other than Milton Friedman. ''Aggressive monetary policy can reduce the depth of a recession,'' declared the George W. Bush administration in its 2004 Economic Report of the President. And the author of that report, Harvard's N. Gregory Mankiw, has actually advocated a much more aggressive Fed policy than the one announced last week.
Now Mr. Mankiw is allegedly a Romney adviser -- but the candidate's position on economic policy is evidently being dictated by extremists who warn that any effort to fight this slump will turn us into Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe I tell you.
Oh, and what about Mr. Romney's ideas for ''creating wealth''? The Romney economic ''plan'' offers no specifics about what he would actually do. The thrust of it, however, is that what America needs is less environmental protection and lower taxes on the wealthy. Surprise!
Indeed, as Mike Konczal of the Roosevelt Institute points out, the Romney plan of 2012 is almost identical -- and with the same turns of phrase -- to John McCain's plan in 2008, not to mention the plans laid out by George W. Bush in 2004 and 2006. The situation changes, but the song remains the same.
So last week we learned that Ben Bernanke is willing to listen to sensible critics and change course. But we also learned that on economic policy, as on foreign policy, Mitt Romney has abandoned any pose of moderation and taken up residence in the right's intellectual fever swamps.

HEADLINE: Republicans vs. Veterans' Jobs

 BODY:
If you made a list of things lawmakers of both parties profess to value at all times -- like ''jobs,'' ''opportunity,'' ''veterans,'' ''law enforcement,'' ''firefighters,'' ''safe streets,'' ''small business'' -- and plugged them into a Congressional bill-writing app, you would probably end up with something like the Veterans Job Corps Act of 2012. 
The bill, sponsored by Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, would hire veterans as firefighters and police officers and for conservation jobs in national parks and on other public lands, through grants to federal departments and agencies and contracts with state and local governments and private organizations. It would give a lift to veteran entrepreneurs and contractors in various ways, like making it easier for veterans to use their military training to qualify for civilian professional licenses.
The bill gives priority to those who served on or after 9/11, with good reason: the jobless rate for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan hit 10.9 percent in August, compared with 8.1 percent nationally. This is a time of persistent homelessness and unemployment among veterans, and record suicides among veterans and active-duty service members, many of them stressed by the burdens of two long wars. It makes sense for the 99 percent of Americans to find new ways to pay their debt to the 1 percent who serve in uniform.
To most people, Senator Murray's bill would seem like one decent way to do that. But not if you're one of those Republicans in Washington who thinks it's more important in an election year to deny Democrats a success or accomplishment of any kind.
This has led to some wacky maneuvers in the Senate. Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, perhaps forgetting where he worked, denounced the legislation as a ''political exercise.'' He also called it a waste of time, since the House wasn't going to pass it anyway, and objected to the cost (estimated at $1 billion for the next five years, though Ms. Murray's aides say the program will be paid for by recovering more money from tax-delinquent Medicare providers and forcing big tax deadbeats to pay up before receiving passports).
''Where is our honor? Where is our valor? Where is our sacrifice?'' thundered Mr. Coburn, suggesting that giving jobs to veterans was an affront to American values. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, went further, saying he would block the bill until Pakistan freed Shakil Afridi, the doctor who helped the United States find Osama bin Laden.
Ms. Murray has tried to make her bill as bipartisan as possible. When Senator Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, proposed his own set of provisions, she folded them all into the bill, which is scheduled for a vote on Wednesday. We'll know then whether good sense prevailed, or the wheels have come completely off the Congressional machine.

HEADLINE: Israeli Leader Makes Case Against Iran On U.S. Shows

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; David E. Sanger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Having been rebuffed privately by President Obama last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel took to the airwaves in the United States on Sunday to warn that Iran was only six or seven months from having ''90 percent'' of what it needed to make an atomic bomb.
Mr. Netanyahu received sharp criticism at home and abroad for similar remarks last week, which were widely seen as an effort to put pressure on Mr. Obama to act more forcefully against Iran. And yet, less than two months before Election Day, he turned to the weekly platform for American politics -- the Sunday morning political talk shows -- to make his case more urgently and specifically than ever to a wider American audience.
He repeated his warning that the only way to stop Iran was for the United States to draw a distinct ''red line'' on that country's nuclear activity and declare that crossing it would trigger military intervention. But he also offered his most explicit description to date of the level of nuclear development that he would regard as particularly dangerous: one bomb's worth of medium-enriched uranium, a level that would take Iran close to a bomb but would still require additional work to make a weapon. 
He implied that Iran would cross that line soon. ''You know, they're in the last 20 yards, and you can't let them cross that goal line,'' Mr. Netanyahu said on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' displaying his familiarity with American football, another Sunday ritual here. ''You can't let them score a touchdown, because that would have unbelievable consequences, grievous consequences for the peace and security of us all, of the world really.''
Iran, which denies that it is pursuing nuclear weapons, warned on Sunday that it would retaliate across the region if it came under attack.
The warnings and threats came after a tumultuous and violent week in the Middle East, which left the Obama administration reeling at times and straining to sustain relations with two allies that have long been viewed as pillars of stability in the region, Israel and Egypt.
On several Sunday shows, Susan E. Rice, the American representative at the United Nations, sought to defend the administration's handling of each relationship. She said that the United States cooperated closely with Israel but believed there was time for diplomacy and sanctions in the case of Iran.
In the case of Egypt, she argued against cutting the annual $1.5 billion in American assistance, an action that some have urged in the wake of the storming of the American Embassy in Cairo last week.
''We think that despite this very bumpy path we're on and the very disturbing images we've seen, it's in the United States' fundamental interest that people have the ability to choose their own governments -- that these governments be democratic and free,'' Ms. Rice said on ''Meet the Press.'' ''That's in our long-term best interest. We need to reinforce that with our assistance.''
The protests, which were inspired by an American-made video denigrating the Prophet Muhammad, spread from Cairo to Libya, where the American ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, and three other Americans were killed. Since then, the protests have spread to nearly two dozen countries and forced the State Department to evacuate all but emergency staff members from its embassies in Sudan and Tripoli, Libya, on Saturday, though the intensity of the demonstrations appeared to be subsiding.
Mr. Netanyahu, who also appeared on the CNN program ''State of the Union'' on Sunday, sought to link the violence with Iran's nuclear ambitions, arguing that Iran's leaders were driven by the same fanaticism that enraged the protesters. Israel has its own nuclear weapons arsenal, though it has never publicly acknowledged it.
''All the things that you see now in these mobs storming the American Embassies is what you will see with a regime that would have atomic bombs,'' he said on CNN. ''You can't have such people have atomic bombs.''
In Iran, the commander of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, took the unusual step of holding a news conference on Sunday to warn that ''nothing will remain'' in Israel if it or any other nation launches attacks against his country.
He said that Iran and its allies -- presumably Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza -- would retaliate at Israel's borders, as would Iran itself in Israel and beyond, targeting American military bases in the Persian Gulf and shutting down the Strait of Hormuz. Iran has often threatened to counter any attack, but the general's threats were unusually specific and signaled Iran's intent to turn any possible attack into a regional conflict.
''Our response to Israel is clear: I think nothing will remain of Israel,'' General Jafari said, according to an account by The Associated Press. ''Given Israel's small land area and its vulnerability to a massive volume of Iran's missiles, I don't think any spot in Israel will remain safe.''
General Jafari also confirmed, in what appeared to be the clearest terms so far, that some high-level advisers from his elite unit were working in Syria and Lebanon, underscoring how deeply intertwined the many conflicts in the region have become.
The United States and Israel have cooperated closely over most security matters for years, including Iran's nuclear efforts, but Mr. Netanyahu's remarks over the last week underscored his desire that the administration act more forcefully with Iran. It also highlighted his evident personal estrangement with Mr. Obama.
The two spoke by telephone on Tuesday after Mr. Netanyahu's first remarks.
While the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency have cited Iranian efforts to accelerate work on enriching uranium, American officials say there is not hard and clear evidence that Iran has resumed work on the military components necessary to build a bomb.
Iran possesses enough low-enriched uranium to make five or six weapons, but that process would be lengthy. Mr. Netanyahu is particularly concerned about a new line of production of uranium largely being conducted in a deep underground site invulnerable to Israeli attack. Iran is expected to have roughly a bomb's worth of that medium-enriched uranium within half a year.
Despite Mr. Netanyahu's contention that Iran is close to developing a nuclear weapons capacity, administration officials have said there would still be time for the United States and others to detect and, if necessary, respond to an effort to move from merely enriching to constructing a bomb.
The differences between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Obama were fully on display on Sunday. Ms. Rice argued that international diplomacy and economic sanctions were having an impact on Iran and should be given time to work.
''They are not there yet,'' she said, referring to the American assessment of where Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions stand. ''They are not there yet, and our assessment is -- and we share this regularly with our Israeli counterparts in the intelligence and defense community -- that there is time and space for the pressure we are mounting, which is unprecedented in terms of sanctions, to still yield results.''
Mr. Netanyahu insisted that he was not trying to influence American politics. He expressed respect for Mr. Obama's vow not to allow Iran to acquire an atomic bomb.
Asked specifically if he felt that Mr. Obama's Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, would take a firmer stand toward Iran, Mr. Netanyahu demurred.
Mr. Romney and Mr. Netanyahu, who are friends, worked together briefly in the 1970s at Boston Consulting Group.
''What's guiding my statements is not the American political calendar but the Iranian nuclear calendar,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. to File W.T.O. Case Against China Over Cars

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The Obama administration plans to file a broad trade case at the World Trade Organization in Geneva on Monday accusing China of unfairly subsidizing its exports of autos and auto parts, a senior administration official said late Sunday, in a move with clear political implications for the presidential elections less than two months away.
The W.T.O. case accuses China of providing at least $1 billion worth of subsidies from 2009 to 2011 for exports of autos and auto parts. While China exports virtually no fully assembled cars to the United States, it has rapidly expanded exports to developing countries, and those exports compete to some extent with cars exported or designed in the United States. 
President Obama plans to announce the move on Monday during a visit to Ohio, one of the most important of the battleground states and a place where the president is trying to capitalize on his bailout of the auto industry. A poll by NBC News, The Wall Street Journal and Marist College last week showed Mr. Obama building a significant lead in Ohio.
The upper Midwestern states have emerged as a key battleground in the presidential election, particularly Ohio, which has rivaled Florida in recent presidential elections as the most hard-fought state of all. Ohio is also the hub of the American auto parts industry, which has suffered heavily from job losses that have coincided with surging imports of auto parts from China.
Auto parts employment in the United States has dropped by about one-half from 2001 to 2010, as imports from China grew nearly sevenfold over the same period, according to data provided by the senior official, who insisted on anonymity citing an administration policy banning on-the-record comments on a new policy before an official announcement is made. Auto parts manufacturers directly employ 54,200 people in Ohio, and when suppliers like steel makers are included, the auto industry accounts for 850,000 jobs in the state, or 12.4 percent of total employment there.
But auto industry experts debate the extent to which those imports have been directly responsible for the closing of factories and for cutbacks at other plants, as ever-increasing automation has also played some role. The slowing of the American auto market since 2008 has had an effect as well, although auto sales have begun to recover in recent months.
Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly accused the Obama administration of not doing enough to challenge China on trade and currency policies. But the timing of the administration case, coming so soon before the elections, makes it likely that the Chinese government will accuse President Obama of playing politics -- an accusation already made by Chinese officials, particularly those with close ties to affected industries, in connection with recent trade cases involving solar panels.
Asked whether the trade cases against China were timed for political impact, the senior administration official replied by e-mail that ''President Obama has prioritized enforcement of Americans' rights in the global trading system from day one, and this administration has a consistent record of action to support American jobs.''
The press office at China's commerce ministry had no comment when told by telephone on Monday morning of the planned trade case, asking for a fax of questions, which did not yield an immediate reply. Chinese officials have denied in general that they subsidize exports.
Chinese exports have surged particularly in the past year, as the Chinese economy has slowed sharply, leaving particularly the domestic Chinese automakers with huge inventories of unsold cars that they are seeking to sell overseas.
Speakers repeatedly mentioned during the Democratic convention the federal government bailout for the Detroit auto industry three years ago, following a perception that the bailout will prove politically advantageous in key states. By contrast, speakers during the Republican convention generally avoided the subject.
The administration also plans to take further legal steps on Monday in a W.T.O. case already pending against China over its imposition of steep anti-dumping duties last winter against more than 80 percent of American car exports to China. That case, described by people in China as largely the result of factional rivalries in Beijing that produced a need to take a strong stand against the United States, has begun to shift the focus of trade tensions between the United States and China toward the automotive sector.
The administration has been mulling a possible W.T.O case against China in the auto sector since at least last winter, and has been encouraged by unions to do so, particularly the United Steel Workers.

HEADLINE: A Choice of Community Care, in Your Own Home

BYLINE: JUDITH GRAHAM


HIGHLIGHT: For people who don't want to leave their homes, a smattering of continuing care retirement communities offer services "without walls," but experts say the concept may be poised to expand more broadly in the years ahead. 

 BODY:
For 51 years, Catherine Mack has lived in a four-bedroom house in Haddon Township, N.J. Even at age 96, she has no intention of leaving.
Joining other older adults at a nearby retirement community doesn't appeal to her, although the facility is attractive and has a great reputation.
"I think in a place like that, life is restricted," Ms. Mack explained. "You eat at a certain time, and you're always around other people. I am more on the side that I like to do what I want to do when I want to do it."
So this independent woman instead selected to get services at home from the retirement community's "C.C.R.C. without walls" program.
Only a dozen continuing care retirement community -- C.C.R.C. -- programs like this exist across the country, mostly east of the Mississippi. But several more are under development, and experts believe the concept may be poised to expand more broadly in the years ahead.
How does it work?
In traditional continuing care communities, members pay a substantial entry fee ($250,000 and up) and monthly fees (typically $2,000 to $4,000 a month) for housing, with a lot of on-site amenities and a guarantee that assisted living and nursing home care will be available, if needed. The model is "come to us and you'll get what you need -- all in one place." 
In a continuing care program without walls, members also pay an entry fee ($20,000 to $70,000) and monthly fees ($250 to $800) and receive a similar guarantee of lifelong care, with a twist. The main focus of these programs is helping people stay healthy and independent in their homes for as long as possible. This model can be summed up as "let us bring what you need to you -- or find a way to make it easy for you to get it."
With retirement nest eggs shrunken because of the recession, and 90 percent of older adults indicating they want to age in place at home, "this was something we feel makes a lot of sense," said Larry Yachcik, president of Porter Hills Retirement Communities and Services in Grand Rapids, Mich., one of the nation's newest providers of such services.
Armen Oumedian, 89, who joined soon after the Porter Hills program opened in July, said, "I see this as a tremendous way to lift a responsibility off the shoulders of my family and make it so I can live a continuing life in the community." 
"It's a great comfort, a great security, to know you'll be taken care of and that you've made all the necessary arrangements," he said.
Programs vary, but all rely on care coordinators to get to know members, understand their living situations, keep an eye on their physical health, and handle problems that come up.
Five years ago, when Ms. Mack had several serious medical problems that put her in the hospital for nearly seven months, "my care coordinator had her finger in the pie all the time," she said. "If there was any little bump in what I was going through, she was right there, trying to fix it."
Her daughter, also named Catherine Mack, 61, said, "It was an unbelievable comfort to us." 
Most programs cover the full cost of any in-home care that's needed (home health care nurses or companions who help older people bathe and dress), as well more intensive long-term services (rehabilitation, assisted living or nursing home care) at no extra cost and with no waiting period.
After Marjorie Rittenhouse, 77, of Painesville, Ohio, came home after foot surgery several years ago, "someone was there 24/7 for seven days," she said. "It was all arranged -- and I didn't pay anything."
At Kendal at Home, in Westlake, Ohio, (launched in 2004), where Ms. Rittenhouse belongs, members also get a thorough fitness assessment, a home assessment to identify changes needed to age in place safely (like grab bars in the bathroom and extra lighting) and a home maintenance assessment to figure out what work needs to be done on a house or an apartment (a new furnace? turn up the temperature in the fridge?), said Lynne Giacobbe, executive director.
Tiered plans with varying levels of benefits are common. The most expensive cover services 100 percent; others can require a co-payment of up to 30 percent for assisted living or nursing home care. Operators say that the most expensive plans are the most popular, because people want the extra protection. When long-term care is necessary, it's typically provided in the assisted living or nursing home section of a continuing care retirement center with which the program is affiliated. 
All programs require that members have health insurance, whether from a private employer or Medicare with supplemental coverage included. If someone has long-term care insurance, rates are discounted. Programs will arrange in-home meals, physical therapy or transportation to medical appointments, as medically required. 
Most let members go to health clubs and social events at associated continuing care retirement centers without charge.
So what's the catch, you're thinking?
Here's the most important one: To join, older people have to be healthy and functioning at a high level independently. If you've got any kind of serious chronic health condition, you probably won't qualify. That's the only way programs like this can work: by excluding people with immediate health needs, including any indicator of dementia, and doing everything possible to make sure that people stay healthy and at home as long as possible instead of needing institutional care. 
"The screening process is much more stringent than for people who move to our campuses," said Victor Amey, president and chief executive of Cadbury Senior Services, which operates two continuing care retirement centers, as well as the program that serves Ms. Mack in Haddon Township.
In checking around, I found one exception to this general rule. The Alexian Live at Home Program in Chattanooga, Tenn., which began in 2002, will take people with mild dementia or cognitive problems who are otherwise in good health for its "bronze" plan, which pays 70 percent of the cost of in-home services but excludes assisted living or nursing home care.
The very feature that makes these kinds of programs so attractive - relatively low entry fees and reasonable monthly fees - could become a problem if more members than expected become ill and need care, and available funds aren't sufficient. So have a lawyer look over the contract carefully to see what rights you have if services are denied or withheld. I didn't hear about this problem, but it's a possibility worth your attention.
Why aren't there more programs of this kind? 
"The focus of the senior housing industry has been on bricks and mortar," not community-based services, said Stephen Maag, director of residential communities for LeadingAge, an industry association. "But we're now getting a recognition there is a significant market out there of people we haven't been serving, and that represents an opportunity." 
In some states, laws that govern continuing care retirement centers didn't allow for these kinds of services and had to be changed. Efforts are under way, or have already succeeded, in California, Connecticut, Florida, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Virginia, according to a paper on the centers that Mr. Maag prepared in February.
Would a "C.C.R.C. without walls" program appeal to you? Do you know of anyone who has had a negative experience in these programs? What concerns do you have, and what questions would you like answered?

HEADLINE: Behind the Cover Story: Andrew Rice on the 'Lingering Mystery' of What Happened at UVA

BYLINE: RACHEL NOLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The author of the magazine's cover article explains how he dug deeper into the controversy surrounding Teresa Sullivan - and what he found. 

 BODY:
 Andrew Rice, a contributing writer for the magazine, wrote this week's cover story about the firing and rehiring of Teresa Sullivan, the president of the University of Virginia. He is the author of "The Teeth May Smile but the Heart Does not Forget," about a Ugandan murder case with political implications. His most recent articles for the magazine have been about the Nigerian film industry, Irish investment in Midtown real estate and a haunted plantation in South Carolina. 
 What interested you about the case of UVA's president? 
Like most people, I first read about Sullivan's resignation in The Washington Post, and followed the protests as they became this big national story, culminating of course in the president's reinstatement. But even after the smoke cleared, I felt like there was this lingering mystery. Why had this whole thing happened?
 Did anything surprise you when you got to Virginia, after having read so much about the controversy there? 
I think that, even before I visited Charlottesville, I was surprised by the degree to which the motivations behind the ouster really were a mystery even to those who were involved. Usually, once you get people talking off the record in a situation like this, a plausible version of events will emerge fairly quickly. In this day and age, it's very tough to keep a secret for long. In this case, though, everyone seemed to be genuinely baffled. It seemed like there had to be some deep, nefarious motivation - otherwise, why put the institution through such trauma? A lot of people still feel that way, but I came to the conclusion (unless further evidence emerges) that the opponents of the president actually meant what they said, misguided as that might have been.
 Is what happened at UVA is emblematic of wider problems confronting universities? 
Sure, I think public universities across the country are facing the same challenge that UVA is: at a time when state governments appear to be retreating from subsidizing higher education, how do you continue to provide it as a public good? My father is a professor at the University of South Carolina, for instance, and he recognized many of UVA's challenges. To take but one example, his department recently got rid of all its professors' landline telephones as a cost-saving measure. At UVA, though, many of these conflicts are magnified, because the school considers itself a an elite institution that competes with the very best private universities. Economizing there, without compromising the school's reputation, is a particularly tricky task. And then, on top of all that, you have a particularly ill-advised set of actions by the board, which turned a fairly routine occurrence - the removal of a president - into a national news event.
 Few people at UVA seemed eager to talk. Why was that? 
Well, some people were eager to talk. Many faculty members were eager to bend my ear, although some of them declined to do so on the record, due to concerns about repercussions from the board, which has to approve various promotions and appointments. And Sullivan was, to her credit, actually quite willing to speak to me, although she was understandably guarded. The board members, however, were another story. I think that many of them have been bruised by the acrimony of the last couple of months and wanted to put it behind them. Many of them also come from private business backgrounds, are not used to justifying their actions to reporters. And finally as I say in the article, UVA is a place where people can keep a secret. Many members just thought it inappropriate to discuss the internal deliberations of the board, even if the results of those deliberations have already been aired in public.

 Did any faculty members side against Teresa Sullivan? 
I have yet to meet anyone, outside of perhaps a few members of the Board of Visitors, who thought the matter was handled appropriately. Even Helen Dragas has admitted to mistakes in the way the push for Sullivan's resignation was carried out. Overwhelmingly, the sentiment of the faculty I talked to - business school professors, liberal arts professors, law professors, everyone - was that the secretive nature of the move discredited any legitimate criticisms the board might have had about Sullivan's performance. And while there were some gripes about that performance, similar to the complaints that you might hear at any large institution, most faculty seemed to agree that two years is not long enough to judge the performance of a university president. Change comes very slowly in a university setting.

 Helen Dragas - the head of UVA's board who initially fired Sullivan - was deeply influenced by a book by Clayton Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor. Was his work a malign influence in this case? 
One of my big regrets about the editing process is that we ended up having to cut, for space, some of the comments I got from Clayton Christensen about this whole matter. Christensen is a really smart and thoughtful guy. I asked him if sometimes he could act out that scene in "Annie Hall," where Marshall McLuhan walks up to the guy in line for the movie and says, "You know nothing of my work!" He laughed and told me that he felt like the majority of the time his theory of "disruptive innovation" was misapplied, and that Andy Grove actually advised him to change the phrase, because "disruptive" has so many negative connotations. So I don't think we can blame Christensen. On the other hand, he was actually pretty sympathetic to the quandary that Dragas and the UVA board faced in trying to push the university to make the kind of changes he sees as necessary. He said: "If you're a visionary and you see the future clearly, watch out, and put a flak jacket on."
 Do you wish anything had made it into the published story? 
I wish I had had a bit more opportunity to write about Helen Dragas, the businessperson, because I think she's actually the most interesting character in this story. I had many hours of conversation with her, most of which I can't discuss because it was off the record. But I can say I came away feeling that there's definitely more to her than the caricature that many of her opponents paint. I really do think she was convinced that she was acting in the best interests of the university. And I also wish that I had a bit more time, as part of that character sketch, to go into more details about her family background, which is equally fascinating. Her father, George, was a child of Greek immigrants who ended up being caught in Greece when the Nazis invaded and apparently ate grass to keep from starving. He himself was a highly successful chairman of the board of Old Dominion University, and led the search committee that hired a president under eerily similar circumstances to the ones presented at UVA. During the course of my reporting, I got Krista Pedersen, a really smart and talented reporter from the student-run Cavalier Daily, to do some background research on George Dragas and the O.D.U. situation. I only got to write a sentence or two about it, but Krista put a lot of her research into an article she published for her newspaper.

HEADLINE: Five Points To Nowhere

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Can Romney run on his "plan"? 

 BODY:
We're now getting a lot of "Romney in disarray" stories; we're also hearing that the solution is for Romney to go out there and sell his five-point plan for the economy.
You've got to be kidding. Has anyone actually looked at that "plan"? Not only is it pathetic; its patheticity (pathos? That doesn't sound right) is no accident. On the contrary, it reflects the same forces that have made the Romney campaign in general such a dud.
It's not just that the plan's rhetoric is the same as every other GOP plan since 2004. Nor is it just the complete absence of specifics. It's the fact that the plan is written in code; Romney doesn't dare say explicitly what he's talking about, because his actual agenda is so unpopular.
So, let's look at the "plan":
And unlike the president, I have a plan to create 12 million new jobs. It has 5 steps.
 [1] First, by 2020, North America will be energy independent by taking full advantage of our oil and coal and gas and nuclear and renewables.
 [2] Second, we will give our fellow citizens the skills they need for the jobs of today and the careers of tomorrow. When it comes to the school your child will attend, every parent should have a choice, and every child should have a chance.
 [3] Third, we will make trade work for America by forging new trade agreements. And when nations cheat in trade, there will be unmistakable consequences.
 [4] Fourth, to assure every entrepreneur and every job creator that their investments in America will not vanish as have those in Greece, we will cut the deficit and put America on track to a balanced budget.
 [5] And fifth, we will champion SMALL businesses, America's engine of job growth. That means reducing taxes on business, not raising them. It means simplifying and modernizing the regulations that hurt small business the most. And it means that we must rein in the skyrocketing cost of healthcare by repealing and replacing Obamacare.
Point by point:
1. This describes what Romney wants to see happen, not what he'd do to make it happen. But to the extent it means anything, it means scrapping environmental protection so that we can drill, baby, drill. Why doesn't he say that? Because voters care about the environment.
2. Again, what does this mean? If it means anything, it means school vouchers -- which are unpopular.
3. Trade agreements per se aren't big job creators -- they increase exports, but they also increase imports. And while a confrontation with China is the implicit subtext of the second part, Romney is apparently unwilling to get explicit.
4. Romney's claim that he will reduce the deficit rests on the assertion that he will offset huge tax cuts by closing loopholes -- but he refuses to name a single example, because tax breaks are popular. Also, Medicaid -- his biggest single spending target -- turns out to have substantial public support, too.
5. Tax cuts for small businesses actually means tax cuts for rich people; there's a small subset of rich people who own small businesses. But Romney has to cloak the real policy in mom-and-pop rhetoric.
So Romney's vagueness on jobs reflects the basic unpopularity of his real agenda. 
What the Romney revival people imagine is that he can now go out and aggressively sell his carefully unsubstantive economic ideas, without letting voters know that his underlying ideas involve things they really don't want.
I suppose a master politician might be able to pull that off. But you go to an election with the candidate you have ...

HEADLINE: In Conversation With: Investigative Reporter Sasha Chavkin

BYLINE: SRUTHI GOTTIPATI


HIGHLIGHT: A mysterious disease strikes farm workers in Andhra Pradesh, Sri Lanka and Nicaragua, investigation finds. 

 BODY:
 A mysterious illness plagues dozens of villages in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, according to a report published today by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit investigative news group based in Washington. The disease, a type of chronic kidney ailment, has affected about a third of the population in some areas in the region of Uddanam, the journalist Sasha Chavkin writes. 
 Mr. Chavkin published a reportlast year about a vast swath of Central America stricken by a similar, and similarly unexplained, epidemic. Now, he reports that India isn't a stranger to the disease either. Mr. Chavkin shares his findings with India Ink, including theories on what's causing the disease and what is behind the mounting death toll. 
 [Full disclosure: Mr. Chavkin was my classmate at Columbia Graduate School of Journalism in New York and we have stayed in touch since graduating. I have also helped put him in touch with a potential source for his reporting from Andhra Pradesh.] 
 Q. 
Could you start by telling me what chronic kidney disease, or C.K.D., is? How dangerous is it?
 A. 
Chronic kidney disease is a common illness worldwide that occurs when your kidneys get damaged and no longer filter your blood properly. In its early stages, it can be managed by changing your diet and lifestyle, but once it gets severe enough you need dialysis and ultimately a kidney transplant to survive. The main causes globally are diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.
But the outbreaks we encountered are totally different from most chronic kidney disease. The victims don't have any of the usual risk factors and are mostly relatively young farm workers. So it's a mystery why their kidneys are failing.
 Q. 
You wrote about Nicaragua's "Island of the Widows," so named because of the deaths of their husbands from C.K.D. there. You've also found the disease in Sri Lanka. What tipped you off that something similar was happening in India?
 A. 
A researcher who was investigating the disease in Nicaragua sent us an unpublished study examining what was happening in Andhra Pradesh. The similarity of their findings was uncanny: rural workers getting sick in the prime of their lives, a very specific geographic area affected, and the disease being discovered by doctors in the 1990s. The crucial tip was when we heard that workers in both places were getting the same very rare kind of damage to a part of the kidney called the tubules - which is consistent with severe dehydration and toxic exposure.
 Q. 
What did you find in Uddanam? Who exactly has it affected?
 A. 
The victims in Uddanam are mostly rural farm workers, and the main crops are cashews, coconuts and rice paddy. Many of them are breadwinners for their families, so when they get sick it devastates the whole community - it leaves a trail of widows and orphans. One of the most dangerous things about C.K.D. is that unless you get tested, you wouldn't notice it until you're already in the late stages of the disease and you need very expensive treatment such as dialysis to survive.
 Q. 
How many people are dying because of this disease in Uddanam?
 A. 
There aren't definitive statistics on how many people have the disease, partly because its not officially recognized and tracked separately from ordinary C.K.D.. But we do know that over the last five years in Uddanam, 1,520 people have gotten treatment for this type of kidney failure through the Andhra Pradesh state health insurance plan, Aarogyasri. Since these are the people who are already advanced enough in the disease to get sick and seek out treatment, we think several times that number are currently in earlier stages of C.K.D.
 Q. 
Has this occurred outside of Uddanam in India?
 A. 
We don't have clear evidence of other outbreaks in India. But we've heard that similar cases have been reported in Tamil Nadu and we're encouraging people with evidence of other outbreaks to tell us about them with a short e-mail form. If you've heard about other cases, we want to know.
 Q. 
You report there are no clear answers as to what's causing this disease. What are some of the theories?
 A. 
The leading theory in Uddanam is that there is some kind of toxic contamination, most likely in the drinking water or possibly in the soil. There are two teams that are studying the disease - one from Harvard University working in partnership with the Andhra Pradesh government, and the other from Stony Brook University in New York. Both are focused on toxic contamination, possibly from pesticides or other chemicals used in the fields, but neither has come up with any clear answers.
In Sri Lanka the government and World Health Organization conducted a massive three-year study and announced just this June that they believe they have identified the culprits: the toxic heavy metals cadmium and arsenic, which they say have gotten into the food chain. But they haven't released any data to support this or explained how they think the contamination occurred. There are still many questions and doubts about their findings. Until the cause is proven, we also can't be sure whether it's the same culprit from Sri Lanka to India to Central America.
 Q. 
What are the measures being taken to tackle C.K.D. in India?
 A. 
Ravi Raju Tatapudi, a leading nephrologist in the area, worked for years to persuade to government to recognize and take action against the disease. Recently, he became the director of medical education for the Andhra Pradesh government, and during the three years he served he succeeded in constructing several state-of-the-art dialysis units. But none of them are in Uddanam itself, and there is still a far greater need that the government is able to meet.
 Q. 
What's the most unexpected thing you found?
 A. 
It's shocking that there is a type of disease that overall has killed tens of thousands of people and affects at least three different regions, but no one in the scientific or international communities is connecting the dots or responding strongly enough to solve the problem. Scientists are convinced that the deaths from this illness could be prevented if they could figure out the cause. No one has made the kind of investment in research that is necessary to solve a problem that has a real solution, and to save lives that really could be saved.
 Q. 
Is the C.K.D. in India similar to the epidemic in Sri Lanka and Central America? How is it different?
 A. 
In many ways the disease is similar in each place - farm workers, relatively young victims, who have tubulo-interstitial kidney damage. But there is one notable difference: in India both men and women seem to get the disease about equally, while in Sri Lanka and Central America the victims are overwhelmingly male. Researchers in Uddanam say this leads them suspect that the cause is some kind of exposure to the community as a whole, such as contamination of the drinking water.
 Q. 
How has C.K.D. affected the community in Uddanam? You mention it's hard for residents to get married there.
 A. 
The effect on the community is devastating - not just in lives lost but economically and psychologically. A number of people in Uddanam told us that families are scared to send a bride or groom to live there, or sometimes to accept a marriage into their family by a person from Uddanam. There is a fear that young people from Uddanam will develop C.K.D. and not live long enough to support a family, and a fear that the region itself is contaminated and people who move there will get sick.
We spoke to two sisters-in-law - they called themselves co-sisters because they lived in the same compound - who had married two brothers and moved to a village in Uddanam called Varaka. Both brothers died of C.K.D. within a month of each other in 2007, when they were in their mid-30s. The family had to sell most of their land to pay for medical care, and the co-sisters now struggle to get by in part by working in what remains of the fields that previously belonged to their husbands.
 Q. 
Do you think C.K.D. is affecting other countries as well? Are you planning to explore that possibility?
 A. 
When I first started investigating this epidemic, it was a story about a single sugar plantation in Nicaragua. Then it kept getting wider and wider - a second plantation, then a nearly 700-mile stretch of Central America's Pacific Coast. Now something very similar is happening in India and Sri Lanka.
We think this may be a broader international epidemic that is just now coming to light.

HEADLINE: 185 Arrested on Occupy Wall St. Anniversary

BYLINE: COLIN MOYNIHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Update: The arrests of protesters mounted as supporters of the Occupy movement gathered in the financial district. 

 BODY:
Updated, Sept. 18 | The police arrested 185 people on Monday as protesters tried to block access to the New York Stock Exchange on the first anniversary of the Occupy Wall Street protests.
Demonstrators had planned to converge from several directions and form what was called the People's Wall around the stock exchange to protest what they said was an unfair economic system that benefited the rich and corporations at the expense of ordinary citizens.
Last year, protesters took over Zuccotti Park, not far from Wall Street, setting up an encampment that became an inspiration for similar Occupy campaigns around the world. But after being evicted from the park in November, the protests lost much of their energy, though their message of economic inequality has resonated in Washington and in the presidential campaign.
On Monday, the police countered the blockade planned by protesters with one of their own, ringing the streets and sidewalks leading toward the exchange with metal barricades and asking for identification from workers seeking access.
Protesters marched though the streets, waving banners and banging drums while accompanied by bands playing "Happy Birthday."
At several points during the morning, crowds of protesters numbering in the hundreds briefly blocked intersections before being dispersed, with arrests in some instances.
Though organizers said more than 1,000 people participated in the demonstration, the roving groups did not appear to cause much disruption on Wall Street.
Officers sometimes surrounded large groups of protesters, though they did not appear to make mass arrests. But on several occasions, officers plunged onto sidewalks packed with protesters and arrested people after saying the crowds were blocking pedestrian traffic.
At one point, at Broad and Beaver Streets, a commander grabbed a man from a crowd standing on the corner. Protesters tried to pull the man back, but officers surged into the crowd and wrested the man away, placing him in handcuffs.
One of the more turbulent episodes took place along Broadway where several hundred people marched. Officers approached a man who had been yelling objections to the metal police barricades that cordoned off Wall Street. When the officers grabbed the man, he began shouting "I did nothing wrong," but they removed him.
As they were leading the man away, a line of officers pushed away a large crowd of people, including news photographers. One officer repeatedly shoved news photographers with a baton, and a police lieutenant shouted at one point that no more photographs would be permitted, adding, "That's over."
Organizers said they had planned the protest to show that the Occupy movement still had vitality and to express continuing frustration with the economic environment.
Among those gathering early Monday was Oren Goldberg, 32, of Bushwick, Brooklyn, who said he had joined the protest partly because he felt the need to somehow register his conviction that the financial system was not operating properly.
"It's exciting to see any group of people attempting any sort of change," he said, adding that Occupy participants were interested in "working toward a greater good than profiteering."
As the protesters gathered as early as 6 a.m., police vans were parked on side streets throughout the financial district, and helicopters buzzed overhead. Men in suits walking to work passed contingents of officers posted on corners.
Sporadic marches continued through the afternoon, along with arrests.
Several demonstrations took place outside financial institutions. Some people were arrested at a Bank of America branch opposite Zuccotti Park. Later the police arrested about a half-dozen people who sat down in front of Goldman Sachs headquarters on West Street while a crowd chanted "arrest the bankers."
As the police directed the crowd to leave the area, people in the building could be seen gazing down from windows. Some of the protesters pointed up to the windows and shouted, "Goldman Sachs, we'll be back," as they began marching toward Zuccotti Park.
As night fell, a few hundred protesters gathered in the park. Their numbers declined, however, after dozens of police officers and private security guards walked through the park and trained powerful spotlights on those inside. 
At one point, as the police arrested a woman inside Zuccotti Park, an officer told a city councilman, Jumaane D. Williams, to get down from a granite bench. Mr. Williams refused, saying he was a Council member and wanted to observe. After Mr. Williams refused a second order to get down, two officers shoved him with batons, knocking him off the bench.

HEADLINE: The Bull Tied to Occupy Wall Street

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: "Charging Bull," the 7,000-pound bronze statue on Broadway in the financial district, has been a protective captive of the police since the Occupy protests began. 

 BODY:
 With a full year having passed since it came into being, Occupy Wall Street is noting the moment in a manner that reflects one of the things it does best. It is celebrating itself.
 That's what the movement did for a while on the 17th of each month. It organized demonstrations to announce, Hey, we're a month old. Yo, try two months old. Look at us, it's been three months.
 Now it is a year. And so quite naturally on this Sept. 17, and over the weekend leading into it, there were demonstrations intended to show that Occupy Wall Street embodies a Sondheim number from "Follies": "I'm Still Here."
 Actually, there hasn't been much discernible movement to this movement of late. Whatever energy it drew from its single-minded insistence on taking up permanent residence in Zuccotti Park dissipated after the police broke up that encampment last November.
 The most enduring occupation of all has been one conducted by the police themselves, in Bowling Green. A year ago, they put "Charging Bull" under siege, and have maintained the encirclement nearly nonstop ever since.
 "Charging Bull" is better known to many New Yorkers as the Wall Street Bull, an 11-foot-tall, 7,000-pound bronze statue by Arturo Di Modica. It has been around for nearly 23 years. Perched on a traffic island on Broadway in the financial district, it has become an enduring tourist attraction. Foreign visitors - Asians in particular seem enamored - flock to the anatomically graphic statue to be photographed touching it front, back and under.
 But when the Occupy protests began last September, the police threw metal gates around the bull, ostensibly to protect it from possible harm. For months, except on a few occasions, visitors could not get past the barriers. That restriction was eased in the spring, with tourists permitted to pass through a narrow parting of the gates. But the barricades remain. So does an ever-present police car and a couple of officers.
 In early summer, the local community board unanimously passed a resolution urging that the gates be removed as an unsightly and potentially hazardous intrusion.
 No one has been more passionate than Arthur Piccolo, chairman of a group known as the Bowling Green Association. Indeed, "passionate" does not begin to capture the depth of Mr. Piccolo's feelings about caging bull. He has described the police siege as unnecessary, as a "militarization" of Wall Street and as "an overtime scam" costing taxpayers many hundreds of thousands of dollars.
 "There's no justification for those barricades or that police car blocking the bull," Mr. Piccolo said in an interview.
 "The fact is there has not been a single case of vandalism from the former Occupy Wall Street," he said. While not a fan of the protesters, he said "there was absolutely no logic why anybody from their movement would come and damage the bull. And they never did."
Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said no plans to remove the barriers were in the works. "They're continued to be used periodically for crowd control when at times people crowd around the sculpture and spill into traffic on Broadway," he said in an e-mail.
 This explanation makes no sense to Mr. Piccolo. "We went practically 22 years without any special attention from the Police Department whatsoever," he said. "If the police feel they need - which is open to question - to protect this plaza, they should do it the same way they protect other locations in the city, with less obnoxious methods."
 For his part, he said he would observe the Sept. 17 anniversary simply by "noting that this abuse has been going on for a year."
 Wall Street is trying to go about its business as well, anniversary protests notwithstanding.
 It might be noted that as demonstrators rolled into action Monday morning the stock market stood at its highest level in nearly five years. The Dow Jones industrial average ended last week 18 percent above where it was on Sept. 17 a year ago. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up by more than 20 percent.
 All in all, things seemed to be going O.K. for the 1 percent and for many in the 99 percent who are invested in the market.

HEADLINE: College, Still Worth It

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The more income you earn, the more likely you are to have gone to college. 

 BODY:
Adam Looney and Michael Greenstone at the Hamilton Project have put together a beautiful chart illustrating once again why college is worth it, despite the current fad of claiming otherwise.
It shows the share of people at each income level who had various levels of educational attainment:
As you can see, the more income you earn, the more likely you are to have gone to college. 
Of the Americans who earn over $150,000, 82 percent had a bachelor's degree. Just 6.5 percent had no more than a high school diploma. And while there are lots of stories about broke college grads, people with higher education are much less likely to have low incomes than those without degrees.
Sure, you say, but people graduate from college with a lot of debt, which must surely wipe out their higher earnings!
Even factoring in the debt, though, college is still a great investment. Here's another chart worth a million words, also from Mr. Looney and Mr. Greenstone, that shows the return on investment for going back to school compared to investing that same tuition money in the stock market, long-term Treasury bills, housing, corporate bonds or gold:
Nothing guarantees financial success, of course. But at the very least, postsecondary education opens the door to higher-paying jobs that are not available to people with fewer skills.

HEADLINE: Germany Making Jews Feel Unwelcome

BYLINE: JUDY DEMPSEY


HIGHLIGHT: The controversy over the legality of circumcision threatens to undo decades of trying hard to make Jews feel at home in this country -- and succeeding. 

 BODY:
BERLIN - A Jewish friend once told me something that I recalled when writing this week's Letter from Europe about Germany and circumcision. 
He said that there were three classes of Jews. 
The first consisted of those who lived in Israel. The second were those who lived in the United States and other countries. And the third, and lowest, were those who lived in Germany. 
Israeli leaders and the media vilified those Jews who decided to remain in Germany after 1945 or who had chosen to return to Germany if they had survived the Holocaust. 
They were considered traitors. It must have been a very lonely time for those who made that extraordinary decision to live in Germany.
Today, Berlin is a different place. It is home to tens of thousands of Jews who have a bustling, lively community. They can worship in several synagogues, send their children to Jewish schools, have kosher shops and sign up to classes to learn Hebrew. 
Berlin is hip, too. 
Each year, young Israelis throng to the German capital. German authorities have made every effort to commemorate and show what Jewish life was before the Holocaust and how it is being slowly rebuilt.
What a change from the dark years of the 1950s when West Germany's total Jewish population numbered between 10,000 and 15,000.
Over 220,000 now live in Germany because many chose to settle here rather than move to Israel once the Soviet Union collapsed over two decades ago.
Indeed, Germany is now home to the fastest growing Jewish communities in Europe as successive governments have made enormous efforts to make the Jews feel welcome, safe, and free to practice their religion. 
And that includes circumcision. Circumcision has become a controversial issue after a regional court in Cologne last June ruled that it amounted to bodily injury. 
Since then doctors across Germany have stopped carrying out circumcision, fearing prosecution. The Jewish and Muslim communities are in uproar, seeing the court's decision as an attack on their religious and cultural identity. The German government is now rushing through a new law that would spell out that male circumcision is legal.
Of all countries, Germany is the one that can least afford to look inhospitable to Jews. Yet, ironically, it was here that a court first challenged the ritual. Now, all over Europe there is a growing debate about whether the practice should be continued.

HEADLINE: Deferred Prosecution Agreements and Cookie-Cutter Justice

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: Deferred and nonprosecution agreements allow prosecutors to take a more nuanced approach. Yet use of the government's "sledgehammer" seems to have largely disappeared, so that a full-scale prosecution of a large corporation is at best a rarity. 

 BODY:
Lanny A. Breuer, the head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, last week spoke to the New York City Bar Association, extolling the virtues of deferred and nonprosecution agreements as the new standard for how the Justice Department deals with criminal conduct by corporations. 
It is not just corporate investigations that are being concluded with these agreements. They have been used recently with individuals to resolve investigations, like the recent agreement with the cyclist Floyd Landis over possible fraud charges. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also embraced them as a means to wrap up civil securities fraud cases. 
But are these agreements all they are cracked up to be as an enforcement tool? Or do they let corporations off too easily? Like anything in the world of white-collar crime, there are good reasons to use them, but questions remain about whether they should be the norm for policing corporate misconduct.
 Deferred and nonprosecution agreements are contracts with the government in which a company (or individual) undertakes specified actions in exchange for charges being dismissed or not filed altogether. The terms usually require payment of a fine, continued cooperation with any investigations or trials and a commitment to enhance internal controls. If the agreement is breached, the agreement typically permits prosecutors to restart the case and use any admissions by the company in the a subsequent proceeding.
A significant advantage to these agreements is that there is no judicial involvement, so the Justice Department does not have to worry about a judge second-guessing its terms or questioning the fairness of the resolution.
Mr. Breuer stated that the growing use of these agreements had meant "unequivocally, far greater accountability for corporate wrongdoing - and a sea change in corporate compliance efforts." He pointed to the recent agreement with Barclays over manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, as an example of how companies pay a heavy price when the settle, citing the replacement of the bank's top management.
But a close look at the Barclays settlement does not show the Justice Department being as tough as advertised. The only discussion of the involvement of senior managers is buried in the press release with a bland reference that "members of Barclays management directed that Barclays's Dollar Libor submissions be lowered." 
There was no specific mention of the former chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., or the chief operating officer, Jerry del Missier, who lost their positions only after significant pressure from the British Parliament, not the Justice Department.
The promised accountability from the agreements does not always mean companies will be completely reformed. James B. Stewart of The New York Times, in a column in July, discussed multiple settlements by the Swiss bank UBS with the government for violations, including receiving immunity in the Libor investigation, which seem "to have had scant, if any, deterrent effect."
Deferring charges is nothing new in the criminal justice system. Many drug- and alcohol-related prosecutions of first-time offenders permit the dismissal of a case when the person completes treatment. The juvenile justice system often uses diversion programs to allow offenders to avoid punishment through education and counseling.
The pivotal event in the rise of deferred and nonprosecution agreements in the corporate context was the demise of accounting firm Arthur Andersen, whose conviction for obstruction of justice in 2002 was later reversed by the Supreme Court. Thousands of employees lost their jobs because of conduct in firm's Houston office related to its auditing work on behalf of Enron.
Mr. Breuer acknowledged that he had heard, and responded to, companies bemoaning the potential effects of a criminal prosecution on innocent employees and financial markets - the specter of Arthur Andersen. He frankly acknowledged that "Sometimes - though, let me stress, not always - these presentations are compelling."
Companies facing potential criminal charges know they need to argue that a criminal conviction would be just this side of Armageddon, making sure to highlight the threat of lost jobs and economic turmoil to persuade prosecutors to give a deferred or nonprosecution agreement. 
And those arguments certainly seem to work for publicly traded companies. This year, there have been 20 deferred and nonprosecution agreements so far, and over 150 since 2007. 
Mr. Breuer is certainly right when he points out that criminal charges are not a very useful means of regulating corporations, so that prosecutors "sometimes had to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. More often, they just walked away." 
Deferred and nonprosecution agreements allow for a more nuanced approach that extracts a penalty and imposes conditions on a company that are similar to the punishment it would receive from a conviction, but without all of the collateral consequences.
But use of the "sledgehammer" seems to have largely disappeared, so that a full-scale prosecution of a large corporation is at best a rarity. The banks caught up in the Libor investigation can certainly expect to settle with the Justice Department and other regulators, using the Barclays agreement as the template for resolving the case.
It seems as if we are coming perilously close to cookie-cutter justice in corporate criminal investigations. Everyone by now knows the drill: turn over the results of an internal investigation, highlight how damaging a conviction would be and then offer to pay the fine and put in place an enhanced compliance program. The press release almost writes itself, but it is the rare case in which senior management pays any price. 
Deferred and nonprosecution agreements are here to stay because they give the Justice Department a means to police corporations while mitigating the full impact of the criminal law. They occupy a middle ground between the sledgehammer of criminal charges and giving a company a free pass. Whether they are the unalloyed good that Mr. Breuer portrayed them as is another question.

HEADLINE: Over 2,000 Miles, Hauling the Memory of the Mother Road

BYLINE: RONALD AHRENS


HIGHLIGHT: A convoy of vintage commercial trucks traced the shadow of Old Route 66 from Illinois to California. 

 BODY:
SAN BERNARDINO, Calif.-- The Historic Highway Convoy 2012, consisting of 30 vintage trucks of modest and mighty proportions, had spent eight days and 2,000 miles on the road, tracing the remnants of Old Route 66, before rumbling into the Inland Empire on Saturday morning.
Their timing was impeccable, as the trucks were on hand to participate in the car show held in conjunction with the annual Route 66 Rendezvous. In its 23rd year, the three-day Rendezvous barely survived this city's bankruptcy, with funds for police protection and other services having been scraped together at a late hour.
The trucks belong to members of the American Truck Historical Society, a group of 21,000 active and retired professional drivers, trucking company owners, enthusiasts and collectors. The convoy was a maiden effort for the organization, located in Kansas City, Mo.
Not counting side trips to drive the rare existing stretches of the original Route 66, as well as to visit other attractions along the convoy's route, the group traveled from Morris, Ill., through seven states. Although Route 66 originated in Chicago, the town of Morris, to the southwest of Joliet, Ill., was the most feasible starting point for the convoy on Sept. 7.
Superhighways like Interstate 44 in Missouri; the Oklahoma Turnpike; Interstate 40 in the Texas Panhandle, New Mexico and Arizona; and Interstate 15 in Barstow, Calif., correspond to the historic route. From Barstow, the road descends through Cajon Pass into San Bernardino.
Route 66 was selected for the inaugural convoy in part because it was "an old-time, regulated-carrier route," Bill Johnson, the executive director of the American Truck Historical Society, said in an interview. Like masters of rally racing, Mr. Johnson had predriven the course. He then compiled a guide for the participants, using the Historic Route 66 as a resource. Owing in part to this diligence, no one strayed, and the convoy made its crossing with only a handful of minor issues - an oil leak from a Mack, a Peterbilt running out of fuel.
Weather conditions included rain in New Mexico's highlands, a chilly Friday morning in the Mojave Desert and the 103-degree Saturday afternoon in San Bernardino, where trucks sat shimmering at the 3rd Street entrance to Meadowbrook Park.
With sponsorship from Travel Centers of America, members of the convoy spent the night at the company's truck stops. Each resting point spawned an impromptu show-and-shine. On occasion, a commercial driver would share memories of a truck, like John Vannatta's 1977 Ford WT9000 cab-over.
Jerry Howard slept all but two times in the impressive sleeper compartment of his truck. Mr. Howard owns a 1949 Peterbilt 350, a classically pugnacious model from that manufacturer. (A 1947 Peterbilt was the convoy's oldest.) Known as El Turbo, the hard-nosed '49 truck, so-called for the exposed radiator, was equipped with an 855-cubic-inch 6-cylinder Cummins turbodiesel engine.
El Turbo developed something of a legend on the West Coast before being restored and settling with Mr. Howard in Fairborn, Ohio. Trucking rules on the West Coast mandated trucks with different configurations from those operated elsewhere, and with its modified 310-inch wheelbase, El Turbo reflected this. Despite being one of the historical society's most active members, Mr. Howard found novelty in the journey.
"I've been in trucking all my life, but this is the first time I've been in a convoy," he said.
Others were making their first cross-country trip. Mr. Johnson mentioned a married couple from Maine who marveled at round barns in Illinois, pickups towing livestock trailers across Missouri and unit trains hauling new cars in Arizona.
Within scant hours of their arrival in San Bernardino, some in the convoy turned around for home. But Mr. Johnson said other trucks would be stored at a lot owned by a member of the historical society in nearby Fontana, Calif., where the trucks would be staged for West Coast winter shows and the next national convention of the society, set for May 30, 2013, in Yakima, Wash.
The inaugural convoy set a high bar. "Everyone is asking where we're going next year," Mr. Johnson said.

HEADLINE: Grappling With Details Of Medicare Proposals

BYLINE: RONI CARYN RABIN


HIGHLIGHT: Election-year proposals to transform Medicare have older Americans asking many questions, and getting few answers. 

 BODY:
When Claire Celsi's father-in-law died in July, the one thing her mother-in-law did not have to worry about was the $300,000 hospital bill. Medicare covered most of it.
But election-year proposals to transform Medicare into a so-called premium-support program, as proposed by Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, are making Ms. Celsi anxious about the health costs she may face in retirement. People age 55 and older would see no changes to their Medicare benefits under these plans.
But at 46, Ms. Celsi is well into her working life. She has contributed to Medicare and has been counting on it.
"I'm 46; my husband is 52. At this stage of our lives, it's already too late to start building up an emergency medical fund that's big enough to pay for all the extra expenses we'd incur," Ms. Celsi said. "I looked at that hospital bill and thought, what if that was me and I didn't have Medicare? What would I do?"
Many health care consumers are wondering the same. But answers to their questions are hard to come by: The proposals keep changing, and some are short on details. No one is certain what health care costs will be in the coming years.
Still, it's clear the proposed changes would shift costs from the federal government to retirees. An early version of a Republican plan would have more than doubled out-of-pocket health expenses for older adults, to $12,500 in 2022, the Congressional Budget Office estimated. "All scenarios will require seniors to pay more," said Robert Moffit, senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization in Washington. To think otherwise, he said, "is a fantasy."
Under the current Republican plan, seniors would buy medical coverage from private insurers or from traditional Medicare, which would compete with private plans. Medicare beneficiaries would receive fixed amounts from the government to help pay the premiums. The amounts would vary with the recipient's income.
The strategy has been supported by conservatives in Congress since the early 1980s, and it has become a central issue in the presidential campaign. The restructuring would affect some of the most vulnerable Americans: the elderly, nearly half of whom live on less than $22,000 a year, and who already spend 16 to 22 percent of their income on health care. Many have dementia and other complex medical problems.
Proponents say that calling such a system a "voucher plan," as many critics have, is misleading.
"It gives a false impression that individuals will be left with a certificate to go out and fend for themselves in an unregulated market," which is not the case, Mr. Moffit said. "It's a defined-contribution system that operates within a very regulated health insurance market exchange, based on what exists in Medicare today."
Participating private health plans would have to offer coverage equivalent to traditional Medicare, for example, and would not be allowed to reject Medicare recipients. The underlying assumption is that private plans can cover older people at a lower cost than the government. But private insurers have not held health costs down in the private market, critics note, and there is no guarantee that the government's fixed contribution would keep pace with rising premium costs.
The Republican plan would "end Medicare as we know it," said Joe Baker, president of the Medicare Rights Center, a national nonprofit organization based in New York City.
A version of the Republican plan drafted in 2011 by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, now the Republican vice-presidential nominee, would have made private coverage the only option for older adults. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the private health plans would charge more than traditional Medicare: about $20,512 a year on average in 2022.
But the government subsidy would be set at only $8,000, adding $6,400 to a senior's annual out-of-pocket medical costs, according to analyses by the Commonwealth Fund and the Kaiser Family Foundation Program on Medicare Policy. Under the plan, medical costs would consume nearly half of the average senior's Social Security income.
Private health plans cost more than traditional Medicare, the Congressional Budget Office said, because they have higher administrative costs and pay higher rates to doctors and hospitals.
Under the current Republican proposal, the value of the government subsidy would be pegged, at least initially, to the cost of the second-cheapest insurance plan in the local market. Beneficiaries would have to pay more if they choose plusher plans, which could include traditional Medicare in some markets. Mr. Romney has said low-income people would receive more generous government support, while higher earners would get slightly less.
Critics say this plan might result in minimal government contributions for retirees in many areas, who would be able to afford only the most tightly managed plans.
Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, said that could mean "the premium is cheap, but you can't find the oncologist you need."
Where does that leave consumers like Ms. Celsi? Most premium-support proposals would exempt those about to turn 55 from changes. Though the average beneficiary in traditional Medicare currently gets free hospital insurance, he or she already has significant out-of-pocket expenses, including about $100 for outpatient coverage under Part B, co-payments or about $177 a month for a supplemental plan to cover co-pays and deductibles, and $33 a month on average for a drug plan under Part D.
But even those who remain enrolled in traditional Medicare might feel changes. Mr. Baker and other critics worry that if private insurance companies "cherry-pick" younger and healthier beneficiaries, the people left in traditional Medicare will be older and sicker, driving up costs for those who remain.
For younger Americans who would face a radically reshaped Medicare, like Ms. Celsi, the key question is how the government would set the level of the premium support, and whether it would keep pace with health care inflation. No one knows what the effect of inflation will be or whether politicians will choose to spend money to keep up.
Under some premium-support proposals, people might not be eligible for Medicare until age 67. That prospect, too, worries critics like Mr. Baker.
"We find people gasping to get to that Medicare finish line at 65 if they were laid off at 62 or 64," he said. "If you raise the age to 67, we'll have uninsured people over 65 for the first time in decades."

HEADLINE: Occupy Wall Street: A Frenzy That Fizzled

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The protests that began a year ago changed little, and were not much more than a fad that left a lasting chant: We are the 99 percent. 

 BODY:
It will be an asterisk in the history books, if it gets a mention at all.
A year ago this week, the Occupy Wall Street movement got under way in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan. The loose group of protesters, frustrated by the economic downturn, sought to blame Wall Street and corporate America for many of the nation's ills.
While the movement's first days did not receive much news coverage, it soon turned into a media frenzy, with some columnists comparing its importance to that of the Arab Spring, which led to the overthrow of leaders in several Middle Eastern and African countries, spurred by social media. Images of the Wall Street protesters getting arrested were looped on news channels and featured on the covers of newspapers. Big banks - and the famous Charging Bull statue that is an icon of Wall Street - were fortified with barricades. By the end of the year, Time magazine had named the protester its Person of the Year, perhaps rightly given the revolutions taking place around the world, but the magazine also lumped Occupy Wall Street in among the many meaningful movements taking place.
But now, 12 months later, it can and should be said that Occupy Wall Street was - perhaps this is going to sound indelicate - a fad.
That is not to say that Occupy Wall Street had no impact. It created an important national conversation about economic inequality and upward mobility. The chant, "We are the 99 percent," has become part of the lexicon. Its message has subtly been woven throughout the Obama administration's re-election campaign, in the Democrats' position on everything from taxes on the highest earners to the soaring levels of student debt.
But consider this: Has the debate over breaking up the banks that were too big to fail, save for a change of heart by the former chairman of Citigroup, Sanford I. Weill, really changed or picked up steam as a result of Occupy Wall Street? No. Have any new regulations for banks or businesses been enacted as a result of Occupy Wall Street? No. Has there been any new meaningful push to put Wall Street executives behind bars as a result of Occupy Wall Street? No.
And even on the issues of economic inequality and upward mobility - perhaps Occupy Wall Street's strongest themes - has the movement changed the debate over executive compensation or education reform? It is not even a close call.
Is there still anger and angst over the horrible unemployment problem in the United States? Absolutely. But that sentiment, and whatever conversation has emerged as result, was going to happen with or without Occupy Wall Street.
The Wall Street banks themselves hardly felt the pinch of the protesters, beyond considering them a nuisance and an additional security cost. Despite campaigns for customers to move money to smaller, community banks, few customers did.
The biggest victory, perhaps, that the movement can claim was a decision by Bank of America and other big banks to scrap plans to charge additional fees for use of debit cards. The protesters also brought awareness to banks' foreclosure practices, and even successfully petitioned to keep some struggling borrowers in their homes.
In the fall of 2011, questioning anything about the movement was not too popular. Doing so was an invitation for withering ridicule. (I experienced it firsthand after I filed what I thought was a relatively respectful column about the protests from Zuccotti Park.)
The problem with the movement, as many other columnists have pointed out before, was that its mission was always intentionally vague. It was deliberately leaderless. It never sought to become a political party or even a label like the Tea Party.
By the second or third time I went down to Zuccotti Park, it became clear to me that Occupy Wall Street, which began with a small band of passionate intellectuals, had been hijacked by misfits and vagabonds looking for food and shelter.
Given the way the organization - if it can be called that - was purposely open to taking all comers, the assembly lost its sense of purpose as various intramural squabbles emerged about the group's end game.
I vividly remember watching one protester with a sign that read "Google = Jewish Billionaires." Another protester ran over and ripped up the poster. The messages had become decidedly too mixed.
Eliot L. Spitzer, the former New York governor and former attorney general who has been a longtime supporter of Occupy Wall Street, recently reflected on the legacy of the movement.
"They are redefining and rebalancing our political discourse," he wrote in Slate. "To all those who are dissatisfied because the Occupy movement did not grow into the complete political theory or social agenda that some wished, I say: Give credit where credit is due."
Fair enough. But even Mr. Spitzer questioned, "We do have to ask, 'Now what?' "

HEADLINE: Gulati Talks About New Women's Coach and New Women's League

BYLINE: ANDREW DAS


HIGHLIGHT: U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati said Monday that he wants to have a coach in place for the women's national team before Halloween, and that there is a still chance there will be a new league for the team's players to work in as soon as next spring. 

 BODY:
U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati said Monday that he wants to have a coach in place for the women's national team before Halloween, and that there is a still chance there will be a new league for the team's players to work in as soon as next spring. Completing the first task, it seems, will be much easier. 
Gulati met Sunday in Los Angeles with U.S. Soccer's newly created search committee -- U.S. Soccer's CEO, Dan Flynn; the longtime federation executive Tom King; and the former national team players Mia Hamm and Danielle Slaton -- and he said they had trimmed a list of interested applicants to replace Pia Sundhage to "double digits," including some "interesting" candidates-- his description -- from overseas. The committee's goal is to hire a coach in the next 30 to 45 days; if they do not, Gulati said, assistant coaches will lead the team during the rest of its post-Olympic victory tour.
The Americans play Australia on Wednesday in Commerce City, Colo., in Sundhage's final match as coach. Their only other scheduled games are two dates against Germany, in Bridgeview, Ill., on Oct. 20 and in East Hartford, Conn., on Oct. 23.
Plans for a new women's league are also the subject of meetings, though they may go on a bit longer. 
Gulati met Monday at the headquarters of Major League Soccer with a group invested in becoming investor-operators in a new women's league. The group included a variety of parties representing U.S. Soccer, former W.P.S. owners, the United Soccer Leagues, the Canadian Soccer Association and newcomers who were not part of previous failed leagues. Some M.L.S. owners have also been involved in the talks.
The discussions at this point are about a league of eight to 10 teams, "with a team or teams in Canada," Gulati said. The preference is to begin play next year in a spring-summer-early fall league, though that could be optimistic.
"Certainly time is short but we're working hard to make that happen," Gulati said. 
As devotees of first W.U.S.A. and then W.P.S. know well, the economics are the hardest part. Both of those women's leagues bled money before folding, so the question the new investors must solve is how to turn interest in women's soccer and a willingness to make a go of it with the financial realities of past failures. Gulati said U.S. Soccer would be more involved in creating the league than it had been in the past, but that a new financial formula -- pro? semi-pro? a hybdrid? -- was the biggest stumbling block to moving forward. 
The inclusion of Canada's national association in the discussions is intriguing since -- as the host of the 2015 Women's World Cup -- it has much to gain from a high level league that would include teams on Canadian soil. But Gulati said no one wants to wait until then to start one. 
"The discussions have been going on for several months," he said. "We're doing everything we can to see if we can make this happen. We don't want a year to go by if that can be avoided, but you want to get it right."

HEADLINE: For Romney Campaign, an Unpleasant Week

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: It may be fleeting, but for the moment Mitt Romney's string of bad luck has given his campaign an air of anxiety -- not what it wants to exude fewer than 50 days before the election. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- In presidential campaigns, as in life, there are unlucky and unpleasant weeks.
Mitt Romney seems to be experiencing both of those right now.
It may be fleeting and it may not mean much in the grand scheme of the election, but for the moment, it has given his campaign an air of anxiety, not what it wants to exude on the heels of a national convention, with fewer than 50 days before Election Day.
On Sunday, just when it seemed that the rough patch might be over, there was this: a small plane crashed at the remote airport where Mr. Romney needed to land for a campaign rally in Colorado.
It was his sole public event of the weekend. It was in a swing state. It was canceled.

A few hours later, as Mr. Romney was aboard a flight to Los Angeles, a story was published in Politico outlining growing tensions within his campaign, much of it surrounding the organization's chief political strategist, Stuart Stevens.
Dirty laundry was aired. Aides groaned, just about audibly.
So it went for Mr. Romney over the past few days. 
New polls showed him losing his edge on the economy, once thought to be his unassailable competitive advantage in the race against President Obama, and lagging behind in crucial swing states.
Campaign finance filings revealed that his fierce fund-raising operation, which has bested Mr. Obama for several months in a row, lost out to him in August, by just enough to sting.
The political class, not to mention a number of Republicans, hammered Mr. Romney over a statement he issued calling the president's handling of the attacks on the Libyan consulate a "disgrace." (With unpredictable events unfolding in the Middle East, it may yet boomerang and hurt Mr. Obama as well.)
On Sunday, in perhaps a fitting coda to a very long week, the Mitt Romney for President Web site put its campaign paraphernalia on sale. The discount: 20 percent.
Nobody judges a presidential campaign by what happens in a single week, and for that, the Romney campaign is no doubt grateful.

HEADLINE: Lowe's Pulls $1.8 Billion Bid for Rona

BYLINE: IAN AUSTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Lowe's Companies said on Monday that it had withdrawn its $1.8 billion takeover bid for a Canadian counterpart, Rona, citing the home-improvement chain's unwillingness to hold merger talks. 

 BODY:
 5:55 p.m. | Updated 
OTTAWA - The home improvement retailer Lowe's on Monday abandoned its $1.8 billion hostile bid for its Canadian competitor Rona, a move that avoids a political showdown with the government in Quebec.
Rona, which is based in Quebec, and Lowe's began apparently friendly discussions as early as July 2011. That led to an offer last December, which was rejected by Rona's board but not disclosed by either company at the time.
In a statement on Monday, Lowe's offered no specific reason for its decision to abandon the bid.
"Lowe's has repeatedly attempted to engage the board of directors of Rona with respect to its proposal in order to conduct confirmatory due diligence and move forward with a friendly, negotiated transaction," Lowe's said.
In a rare point of agreement, both the Liberal Party, which lost an election this month in Quebec, and the separatist Parti Qubcois, which will form the province's next government, spoke out strongly against the deal despite commitments from Lowe's to maintain a Canadian head office in Quebec and to cultivate Canadian suppliers.
Despite the deal's collapse, Lowe's continued to promote what it saw as the deal's benefits.
"A combination of Lowe's and Rona makes business sense and would create significant value for all stakeholders," Lowe's said. "It is unfortunate that the Rona board of directors did not recognize the important economic and commercial benefits of this proposal."
Canada's real estate and mortgage markets largely escaped the turmoil that hit the United States in 2008, making expansion in Canada attractive for Lowe's and other American retailers. Target is in the process of opening its first Canadian stores, and last week Nordstrom announced it would open its first four locations in Canada.
Some credit analysts also expressed reservations about the added debt Lowe's would assume if it bought Rona. Many equity analysts wondered how Lowe's would incorporate Rona's hodgepodge of store sizes and concepts.
Rona owns 61 big-box outlets similar to Lowe's and Home Depot. But Rona also owns 178 small stores, and an additional 374 stores are franchised or owned by independent dealers. The owners of those stores were among the takeover's strongest opponents.
The dealers' prominence in small towns in Quebec seemed to feed the move to keep Rona independent. That sentiment was less noticeable in the rest of Canada, and the Lowe's bid was favorably viewed by most of the investment community outside of Quebec.
Lowe's hostile bid put Caisse de Dpt et Placement du Qubec, which manages a variety of government-related investment funds, in an awkward position.
The fund, which held 12 percent of Rona's shares when Lowe's began its bid and then increased that stake to 14 percent, operates at arm's length from the government.
But it also has a mandate to promote the province's economy and businesses while ensuring healthy returns.
Now that Rona's board and management have fended off Lowe's bid, they will be under increased pressure to show that the company's reorganization plan is working. On Monday several analysts predicted that Lowe's might return with a third bid for Rona.
"Given a slowing Canadian housing market and outlook for sluggish consumer spending, we expect Rona's results - notably top line - to remain pressured and we would therefore expect a certain level of shareholder support for a transaction, at an appropriate price," Irene Nattel of RBC Capital Markets, a unit of the Royal Bank of Canada, wrote in an investment note.
In an e-mail, Rona said that it had learned about Lowe's decision through a news release. "Our focus is on the implementation of our business plan based on the renewal of our offer to consumers," wrote Valrie Lamarre, a spokeswoman, referring to the reorganization plan. "This focus remains."

A business blog outlines what's at stake for the economy, and Diana Ransom begins a series analyzing the issues affecting entrepreneurs.

HEADLINE: A Shift in Strategy in Romney's Latest Ads

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: New TV ads from Mitt Romney's campaign focus on specific ideas to revive the economy, create jobs and reduce the nation's long-term debt, with less emphasis on assailing President Obama. 

 BODY:
New ads by Mitt Romney's presidential campaign began running Monday as part of a shift in strategy to focus more on the his specific ideas to revive the economy, create jobs and reduce the nation's long-term debt.
In one ad, Mr. Romney promises a stronger middle class by improving foreign trade with a "crackdown on cheaters like China" and cutting the federal deficit. 
"You've got to stop spending more money than we take in," Mr. Romney says in the ad, which does not mention or directly criticize President Obama. In the ad, called "The Romney Plan," Mr. Romney also pledges to create 12 million new jobs with a focus on small business.
A second ad is tougher on Mr. Obama, accusing his administration of failing American families by allowing the nation's debt to skyrocket. In the ad, Mr. Romney says that the country has "a moral responsibility not to spend more than we take in."
Both ads are part of a new effort by Mr. Romney's campaign to refocus their messagein the wake of slumping poll numbers, criticism from Republican party officials and discord inside the campaign's headquarters in Boston.
The ads emphasize making the positive case for Mr. Romney's presidency. For much of the campaign, the Republican candidate has focused more on attacking Mr. Obama's record in office. But strategists now believe the campaign must offer voters more explanation about how things will change if Mr. Romney wins the White House.
Mr. Romney plans to continue his focus on that message during a speech on Monday to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, in Los Angeles. According to excerpts released by the campaign, Mr. Romney plans to echo his new ads by pledging to balance the federal budget, shift spending responsibility to the states and reduce federal employment by 10 percent through attrition.
"These things combined will reduce spending by $500 billion a year by the end of my first term," Mr. Romney is expected to say, according to the excerpts. 
The speech to the Hispanic group is an attempt by Mr. Romney's campaign to reach out to a demographic group that has traditionally favored Democrats. In his speech, however, Mr. Romney plans to focus more on his overall plans for the economy than on the specific issues of concern to Latinos.
He will, however, note that the unemployment rate among Hispanics is higher than the overall national rate. And he will note the need to "permanently fix our immigration system," without offering specific suggestions for how he would break the ideological logjam in Washington over the contentious issue.
"I believe we can all agree that what we need are fair and enforceable immigration laws that will stem the flow of illegal immigration, while strengthening legal immigration," he is expected to say, according to the excerpts.
Mr. Obama's campaign offered a sarcastic video Monday in anticipation of Mr. Romney's speech to the Hispanic group. The video, titled "Mitt Romney: Extreme Makeover Latino Edition," suggests that the Republican candidate is trying to paper over his "extreme" views about immigration with more moderate rhetoric.
"Mitt Romney is faced with one of his most implausible makeovers yet," the video says. "Making his extreme policies seem appealing to Latino voters."

HEADLINE: Romney Aide Concedes Campaign Has Been Short on Specifics

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The Romney campaign plans a more positive message highlighting some of the candidate's positions on important issues. 

 BODY:
 7:27 p.m. | Updated A top strategist for Mitt Romney conceded Monday that the campaign has not provided enough specifics about the candidate's vision for the country and pledged a renewed effort in the last 50 days of the race to better communicate with voters.
Ed Gillespie, a veteran Republican operative who is advising Mr. Romney, told reporters that voters were demanding more specifics from the campaign on the economy, foreign policy and energy concerns. He said the revamped approach will focus on communicating better about the candidate's existing ideas rather than providing new ones.
"We are not rolling out new policy," Mr. Gillespie said, "so much as we are making sure people understand that when we say we can do these things, here's how we are going to get them done and these are the specifics."
For months, Mr. Romney's central strategy has been to attack President Obama's leadership and his handling of the economy. Aides have long said they believe the campaign will be a referendum by voters on their dissatisfaction with the president and the direction of the faltering economy.
But Mr. Gillespie said that recent polling done by the campaign suggested that voters were increasingly tuning into the campaign now and were eager to hear more from Mr. Romney about his own plans.
"What we have found is that people want to hear a little more of that," Mr. Gillespie said. "We think there's a demand out there."
The shift in approach comes amid increasing criticism from Republicans outside the campaign and polls showing Mr. Romney slipping in key swing states. An article in PoliticoSunday night detailed carping among Mr. Romney's campaign advisers about who is to blame, with much of the finger-pointing aimed at Stuart Stevens, the top strategist for the campaign.
Conservative supporters of Mr. Romney's campaign have increasingly voiced concern that the campaign has been too vague in its promises to voters and risks offering a bland alternative that will not succeed in November.
William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, wrote last week that Mr. Romney must "speak up" on the specifics that would animate his presidency or risk losing.
"When a challenger merely appeals to disappointment with the incumbent and tries to reassure voters he's not too bad an alternative, that isn't generally a formula for victory," Mr. Kristol wrote. "Mike Dukakis lost."
John Podhoretz, a conservative commentator, wrote in The New York Post that: "Romney & Co. are wrong if they think negative feelings toward Obama are sufficient to motivate their voters. These people would like very much to believe in their candidate. That's not happening now."
Mr. Gillespie did not directly address Mr. Stevens or the late-in-the-game campaign squabbling inside and outside of the Boston headquarters. And he said the timing of the change in strategy was partly a natural evolution now that the election is drawing near and more voters are paying attention.
But he made clear that the campaign views the coming period as the time for a "new emphasis and renewed emphasis" on Mr. Romney's approach to governing.
As examples, Mr. Gillespie said that in a speech in California Monday, Mr. Romney would highlight previous proposals to limit the growth in federal programs and reduce the federal work force that will reduce spending by $500 billion in four years. The speech will be before the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Los Angeles.
Asked for examples of other specifics, Mr. Gillespie said the campaign would underscore its promise to be energy independent by the year 2020 by repeating Mr. Romney's pledge to approve the Keystone oil pipeline, allow drilling off the coast of Virginia and lift the moratorium on oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico.
"The timing is right at this moment to reinforce the specifics," Mr. Gillespie said.
The approach will involve new stump speeches by Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, Mr. Gillespie said. 
In Los Angeles on Monday, Mr. Romney did not deliver an entirely new speech, but it had a different emphasis. The candidate, who usually
devotes much of his standard stump speech to a lengthy indictment of Mr. Obama's record, instead focused heavily on his plans to
eliminate government spending in Los Angeles. He outlined his proposal to cut federal subsidies for Amtrak, the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, the Legal Services Corporation,and the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities. (The ideas are not new for Mr.
Romney, but they rarely make their way into his remarks.)
However Mr. Romney still withheld many key details. When explaining his plan to reduce the size of the federal government by $500 billion
a year, he vowed to cut employment by 10 percent through attrition and eliminate or combine agencies, but did not say how many or identify
which.
Sounding a familiar theme, Mr. Romney declared that "the President has put us on the road to Greece. I will put us back on the road to a
stronger America, one which stops spending more than we take in." 
In his conference call with reporters, Mr. Gillespie said the new approach would also involve background papers and new ads, some of which began running on Monday.
In one new ad the campaign released Monday morning, Mr. Romney promises he would make a stronger middle class by improving foreign trade with a "crackdown on cheaters like China" and cutting the federal deficit.
"You've got to stop spending more money than we take in," Mr. Romney says in the ad, which does not mention or directly criticize Mr. Obama. In the ad, called "The Romney Plan," Mr. Romney also pledges to create 12 million new jobs with a focus on small business.
That ad, and another emphasizing the growth in the nation's debt, are intended to make the case for Mr. Romney taking over in the White House.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Obama's campaign said the ads would not convince voters that Mr. Romney's prescriptions for the country are better than the ones that Mr. Obama has been following for the past several years.
"The American people have no reason to believe Mitt Romney would reduce the deficit or strengthen the middle class - it's not what he did as governor and it's not what he's proposing to do as president," said Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign.
After the speech in Los Angeles on Monday afternoon, Mr. Romney's campaign schedule remains light for the rest of the week. There is a planned fund-raiser in Los Angeles Monday night, and Mr. Romney has no public events on Tuesday. He is scheduled to have only a single public event on each day later in the week, though the campaign could still add events.
On Sunday, Mr. Romney had planned an event in Colorado, a critical swing state where Republicans had hoped to deny the president a repeat victory. But a small plane crash at the airport where Mr. Romney was scheduled to land forced the event to be canceled.
 Michael Barbaro contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Romney Calls 47% of Voters Dependent in Video

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR AND MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: A video of Mitt Romney at a fund-raiser shows him saying that those who pay no federal taxes would vote for President Obama "no matter what." 

 BODY:
 12:26 a.m., Sept. 18 | Updated 
WASHINGTON - During a private reception with wealthy donors this year,Mitt Romney described almost half of Americans as "people who pay no income tax" and are "dependent upon government." Those voters, he said, would probably support President Obama because they believe they are "victims" who are "entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it."
In a brief and hastily called news conference Monday just after 10 p.m., Mr. Romney acknowledged having made the blunt political and cultural assessment, saying it was "not elegantly stated," but he stood by the substance of the remarks, insisting that he had made similar observations in public without generating controversy.
The video of Mr. Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, was made in May, offering a rare glimpse of his personal views. Mr. Romney told reporters that he had been "speaking off the cuff in response to a question" at the fund-raiser, and said he wanted "to help all Americans - all Americans - have a bright, prosperous future."
Democrats quickly condemned the remarks as insensitive, and Mr. Obama's campaign accused Mr. Romney of having "disdainfully written off half the nation."
The video surfaced as the campaign enters its final 50 days and as Mr. Romney sought to restart his campaign with new ads and new messaging, in response to calls in his campaign and from outside for him to be more specific about how his policies would fix the nation's economy and help the middle class. 
Now, the video has raised the possibility that Mr. Romney's campaign will be sidetracked, with attention focused again on his proposed tax cuts for the wealthy, the release of his personal tax returns and his ability to connect with middle-class voters. With its unvarnished language, the video seems to undermine what aides have argued is an enduring attribute that would appeal to independent voters: a sense that Mr. Romney is, at base, an empathetic and caring man.
Snippets of the video of Mr. Romney were posted online Monday afternoon by Mother Jones, a liberal magazine, which said it had obtained the recording and had confirmed its authenticity. The magazine said it was concealing the identity of the person who had recorded the video and the location and time of the recording.
The author of the Mother Jones article, David Corn, said on MSNBC that the video was shot on May 17 at the Boca Raton, Fla., home of Marc Leder, a financier, who held a $50,000-a-person fund-raiser for Mr. Romney that night.
In one clip, Mr. Romney describes how his campaign would not try to appeal to "47 percent of the people" who will vote for Mr. Obama "no matter what." They are, he says, "dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them."
He says those people "pay no income tax," and "so our message of low taxes doesn't connect." Mr. Romney adds: "My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."
The comments were much more stark than Mr. Romney's usual remarks, though he typically talks in public about supporters of Mr. Obama's wanting big government to take care of their problems. He often accuses Mr. Obama and his supporters of wanting to bring a European-style socialism to the United States. In the video clips, Mr. Romney says his campaign is concentrating on the "5 to 10 percent in the center" whom he described as "thoughtful" voters.
Mr. Romney addressed the video, somewhat awkwardly, at a fund-raiser Monday night in Costa Mesa, Calif., summoning reporters with a few moments' notice to walk through the Segerstrom Center for the Arts, which was filled with guests sipping drinks at tables elegantly draped in blue cloths.
Mr. Romney said his comments addressed "a question about direction for the country: Do you believe in a government-centered society that provides more and more benefits? Or do you believe instead in a free-enterprise society where people are able to pursue their dreams?"
Asked whether he delivers different, starker messages to wealthy donors than he does to ordinary voters at campaign rallies, Mr. Romney said he was offering the same message, though he has never used the language in the video at a public event.
But Mr. Romney acknowledged that he wanted to offer donors a candid sense of his strategy, given the role they play in his campaign. "That's something which fund-raising people who are parting with their monies are very interested in - knowing can you win or not and that's what this was addressing," he said.
Mr. Romney, who has been under fire for releasing only two years of his tax returns, was quickly attacked by the Obama campaign. Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, said in a statement Monday evening that it was "shocking" that Mr. Romney would "go behind closed doors" to describe nearly half of the country in such terms.
Late Monday night, Mr. Messina sent out a fund-raising appeal to Mr. Obama's supporters, saying that someone "who demonstrates such disgust and disdain for half of our fellow Americans" does not deserve to be president.
Mr. Romney is not the first presidential candidate to be caught speaking candidly at a fund-raiser. Four years ago during the Democratic primary campaign, The Huffington Post published Mr. Obama's remarks at a San Francisco fund-raiser, saying small-town Pennsylvania voters, bitter over their economic circumstances, "cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them" as a way to explain their frustrations.
The Romney video was unearthed apparently with help from James Carter, a grandson of former PresidentJimmy Carter. Mr. Carter, who lists "oppo researcher" on his Twitter bio, told New York Magazine that he had helped find the videos and get them to Mr. Corn. He is credited with "research assistance" on the Mother Jones Web site. Mr. Romney has repeatedly compared Mr. Obama to President Carter, suggesting both were failures.
In an audio clip posted online from the same fund-raiser, apparently by the person who gave the videos to Mother Jones, Mr. Romney is heard joking that he would have an easier time winning the election if his father had been born to Mexican parents.
"My dad, as you probably know, was the governor of Michigan and was the head of a car company," Mr. Romney says in the audio clip. "But he was born in Mexico, and, uh, had he been born of, uh, Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot at winning this."
But the most striking part of the video is Mr. Romney's characterization of nearly half of the country. His assessment of the "47 percent" echoes a line of conservative thinking that is championed by his running mate, RepresentativePaul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. Mr. Ryan has long argued that nearly half of the people in America are either "dependent" or "reliant" on the federal government.
Mr. Romney's figure of 47 percent comes from the Tax Policy Center, which found that 46.4 percent of households paid no federal income tax in 2011.
But most households did pay payroll taxes. Of the 18.1 percent of households that paid neither income taxes nor payroll taxes, the center found that more than half were elderly and more than a third were not elderly but had income under $20,000. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the center, wrote in a blog post last summer that about half of those were off the rolls because they had low incomes.

HEADLINE: Look How Far We've Come Apart

BYLINE: JONATHAN HAIDT and MARC J. HETHERINGTON


HIGHLIGHT: Political polarization in America is at its highest level since the late 19th century. Can we do anything about it? 

 BODY:
In the witches' brew of fearmongering, unkeepable promises and poll-tested metaphors that both parties serve up to the electorate every four years, you can always find this predictable dash of inspiration: the image of Americans uniting and working together for the sake of the country. President Obama said in Charlotte, N.C. that America is "about what can be done by us, together." In Tampa, Paul Ryan said, "Whatever your political party, let's come together for the sake of our country." And Mitt Romney closed his convention speech with three invocations of "That America, that united America."
But America is not united and it is getting less and less unitable with each passing decade. You can see us coming apart in three simple graphs.
The first graph shows the intensity of the divisions in Congress. The political scientists Nolan McCarty, Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal have quantified the degree to which the parties have become ideologically homogeneous and separated from each other along a single left-right dimension. High numbers mean that the parties are polarized - House and Senate votes are very predictable, even on issues that have little to do with traditional dividing points like the size and scope of government. Low numbers mean that votes are more mixed and less predictable - there's more room for bipartisan coalitions and compromise on specific issues.
As you can see, both houses of Congress were quite polarized in the decades after the Civil War and Reconstruction, but then polarization plummeted after World War I, and it stayed low during the Depression, World War II and the post-war decades. Political scientists cite many reasons for the dip in the middle, including shifts in the coalitions that composed each party, the shared experiences of war and economic calamity and very low levels of immigration, which allowed a stronger sense of national identity to form. E pluribus unum takes time.
But things started to change in the 1960s and 1970s, as the Democrats became the party of civil rights and the Republicans forged an alliance with the religious right. By the 1980s, the two parties were well on their way to ideological purification: liberals and more recently moderates no longer felt at home among congressional Republicans, while conservatives felt unwelcome among congressional Democrats. The trend has been steady, continuing right up through the imminent departure from the Senate of Olympia Snowe, one of the last remaining moderate Republicans. On the bright side: it is mathematically impossible for congress to get much more polarized.
The second graph shows that it's not just politicians who are moving further apart; it's us - the public - as well. The American National Election Study has been asking Americans since the 1970s to rate different groups on what they call a "feeling thermometer." You can say how warm or cold you feel toward groups such as immigrants, members of the military, the Republican Party or the Democratic Party, using a scale that runs from zero (really cold, really dislike them) to 100 (really warm, really like them).
When you graph these temperature ratings from Republicans and Democrats toward each of the two parties, you see two lines that are high and steady: Democrats have always felt warmly toward the Democratic Party, and Republicans feel the same fondness for their party. But the two lower lines show a trend that is perfectly consistent with the first graph: increased hostility toward the other party, accelerating in recent years.
During the Carter administration, cross-party ratings were not much below 50 - just slightly cool. But Democrats' ratings of Republicans go steadily down from there, falling to 33 degrees under George W. Bush and a frigid 17 under Barack Obama. The Republicans show a slightly different trajectory, holding steady during the twelve-year Reagan-Bush period. But beginning with the Clinton years, Republicans sour on Democrats and join them in intensifying mutual dislike (18 degrees) during the Obama administration. To put those low scores in perspective, they are even lower than Democrats' ratings of Richard Nixon in the years after Watergate.
So far the story has been quite similar for both parties. But the third graph shows us why it's the Republicans who now seem to be more radicalized, energized and opposed to compromise.
The American National Election Study has long included a question about how much people "trust the government in Washington to do what's right," with the possible answers being "just about always," "most of the time," or "only some of the time." In the third graph we plot the responses to this question from 1964 on, when the A.N.E.S. first started to ask the question regularly. The graph shows three major features.
First, the long term trend is down. Way down. During the Johnson years, more than two-thirds of Americans said they trusted the government either just about always or most of the time. After Watergate and the Vietnam War, it dropped down closer to one third.
Second, the graph shows that Republicans don't trust government less than Democrats do, historically. The real difference is that Republicans are more sensitive to who controls the White House. When their man is in, they trust government more than Democrats do. When their man is out, they trust it less. Democrats hold steadier; they seem to identify "government" less with the presidency than Republicans do.
Third, and most important for our current predicament, Republicans showed an unprecedented plunge in trust when Obama took office. They were at a 40-year-high water mark under George W. Bush, and then cascaded to a 50-year-low point - an astonishing 5% - under Barack Obama. And it's not just Tea Partiers, it's nearly all Republicans who distrust government today.
So what can we do? Do these three graphs foretell our future? Are we going to see more cross-party cooling? Ever more distrust and paralysis? Not necessarily. In the long run, we see two possible ways out - two reasons why polarization may be lower in a decade or two.
The first is generational change. Most Americans who lived through the Second World War were profoundly influenced by it. America was attacked and it pulled together to fight back. Americans rallied on to wage a bipartisan cold war against communism. Politics, it was said, stopped at the waters' edge. Politicians from those generations could work together and achieve compromise despite their differences, as Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill famously did.
But as those generations aged out of leadership positions, they were replaced by baby boomers whose formative political experience was more akin to a civil war, a divisive struggle over a handful of issues that we are still fighting about today: race, abortion and women's rights, respect for authority and protection of the environment. In a decade or two, when the millennial generation starts taking the reins, things might be very different. If their formative experiences are 9/11, a long recession and the discovery that their parents and grandparents spent all the money, leaving them a mountain of debt, they might well find the will to work together to dig themselves out.
The second reason for hope is that there are many changes we can make now, over the next few years, that might roll back the polarization by a decade or two. Several recent books contain lists of great ideas backed up by years of insider experience (see in particular Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein's "It's Even Worse Than It Looks" and Mickey Edwards's "The Parties Versus The People"; see also the list from NoLabels.org). Some of these changes would reduce gridlock directly by making it easier for the majority party to implement its program - and then be held accountable by the public for the results. For example: making it harder to launch and sustain a filibuster in the Senate, or making it easier for a president to obtain a quick up-or-down vote on nominations for judicial and administrative appointments.
Other changes would push the parties back from their recent strategies of "energize the base" to the strategy that usually prevailed before 2004, which was "win the center." The key is to draw in more moderate and centrist voters, for example by expanding the electorate by making it easier to vote (why on Earth do we vote on a work day?). Many commentators address the need to undo the pernicious effects of the Citizens United ruling, which has opened the floodgates for nasty anonymous advertising. Nasty ads, it almost goes without saying, tend to energize partisans and turn off moderates.
Other changes would work more gradually by making it easier for politicians to recover the sort of human relationships that have always lubricated the gears of government. For example, in 1995 Newt Gingrich changed the legislative calendar to encourage House members to keep their families in their home districts, rather than moving to Washington where they often fraternized with the enemy. Nowadays, all business is conducted midweek. Many members fly in on Tuesday morning and fly home Thursday evening, leaving few possibilities for meeting members of the other party off of the battlefield and out of sight of the press. Mann and Ornstein propose changing the calendar in both the House and the Senate so that Congress is in session five days a week for three weeks each month. Such an arrangement would be both more efficient (less time wasted in transit) and more humane (more opportunities for relationships to form).
The few months after Election Day offer us the largest window we're likely to have in the next four years to make any of these changes. Averting the fiscal cliff - the automatic spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to take effect in 2013 if a deal isn't reached before then - will clearly be the top priority during those months. But if our leaders manage to avert catastrophe, and even more pressingly, if they don't, will they then turn their attention to bridging our political canyon? Or were they just blowing smoke in our eyes when they said that America is about "what can be done by us, together." If ever there was a need for us all to "come together for the sake of our country," our "united America," it is now. Whatever our ideological differences, can we at least agree to push our leaders, after the election, to get their house in order?

HEADLINE: The Reasons Behind the 'People Who Pay No Income Tax'

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney is right that about half of American households do not pay federal income tax. That reflects the way the tax burden has been designed -- including provisions championed by Republicans. 

 BODY:
Mother Jones has published a video of Mitt Romney at a private fund-raiser making incendiary remarks about Obama voters - and, well, about half of the electorate.
"There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what," Mr. Romney said. "There are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it, that that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what."
"These are people who pay no income tax," he added.
I'll address just that last part in this post.
Mr. Romney is absolutely correct that about half of American households do not pay federal income tax. (He is also tapping into a now long-running vein of conservative anger at those households.) But he is missing some crucial context on why they do not pay federal income tax. 
The nonpartisan and highly respected Tax Policy Center derived the 47 percent number - it is actually 46 percent, as of 2011 - and published an excellent analysis of it last summer.
It found that about half of the households that do not pay federal income tax do not pay it because they are simply too poor. The Tax Policy Center gives as an example a couple with two children earning less than $26,400 a year: The household would pay no federal income tax because its standard deduction and other exemptions would simply erase its liability.
The other half, the Tax Policy Center found, consists of households taking advantage of tax credits and other provisions, mostly support for senior citizens and low-income working families.
Put bluntly, these are not households shirking their tax liabilities. The pool consists mostly of the poor, of relatively low-income working families and of old people. The tax code is specifically designed to reduce the burden on them.
Indeed, the recession and its aftermath have left tens of millions of workers out of a job or underemployed, removing more households from payment of federal income taxes. Moreover, the Bush tax cuts - the signature Republican economic policy of the 2000s, which doubled the child tax credit, increased a number of other deductions and exemptions, and lowered marginal tax rates - erased millions of families' federal income tax liabilities.
It is also worth noting that though tens of millions of families do not pay federal income taxes, there are virtually no families that do not pay any taxes - between payroll taxes, sales taxes, state and local taxes, and on and on.
For much more detail on the 46 (or 47) percent, read my colleague David Leonhardt's 2010 column or my 2011 piece for Slate.

HEADLINE: Ford Reaches Deal in Canada; Union Extends Deadline for G.M. and Chrysler

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OTTAWA -- The Canadian Auto Workers union reached a tentative contract deal with the Ford Motor Company of Canada on Monday just hours before a midnight strike deadline.
And Monday night, after reaching the accord, Ken Lewenza, the president of the union, said the union had extended contract negotiations with General Motors of Canada and Chrysler Canada. He warned, however, that the two automakers would face a strike unless they agreed to the same key terms as Ford.
''The gap is still miles apart because we have a tremendous amount of work,'' Mr. Lewenza said. ''There's so many issues on the table it would impossible for General Motors and Chrysler's to respond.'' 
The extension followed the arrival at the negotiations in downtown Toronto of two senior executives from Detroit: Al Iacobelli, the vice president for employee relations at Chrysler, and Cathy Clegg, General Motors' vice president for labor relations.
Mr. Lewenza said the extension was intended to give the companies time to study the tentative agreement reached with Ford. If the union believes they are procrastinating, he said, it will give two automakers 24 hours notice of a strike.
''Our patience and anxieties in the workplace only have so much time,'' Mr. Lewenza said.
While the union gave concessions to Ford on wages and pensions, it said it was still able to uphold its major negotiating principles. Ford agreed to gradually rehire about 600 union members who were laid off from its plants, and it committed to produce a new line of vehicles at its assembly plant in Oakville, Ontario.
It is a good deal in these economic times, Mr. Lewenza told a news conference. ''It's far from a carry-over agreement.''
Mr. Lewenza emphasized that the union would not budge on its traditional approach of requiring all three Detroit-based companies to accept the same key contract terms, a system known as pattern bargaining.
''Pattern bargaining is a concept to make sure that one company isn't disadvantaged,'' Mr. Lewenza said, adding that he would rather avoid a strike.
''Our job is to manufacture cars and build components,'' he said. ''Our job isn't to go on strike.''
Accepting the Ford deal may be particularly difficult for Chrysler. In a statement over the weekend, the company indicated that Ford might not be a suitable model for Chrysler, the smallest employer of the Detroit Three in Canada.
Sergio Marchionne, the Chrysler Group's chief executive, has also repeatedly demanded that the Canadian union adopt a pay system for new hires used in the United States, something not found in the agreement with Ford, or risk having Chrysler leave the country.
Chrysler said in a statement on Monday night that it was studying the tentative agreement with Ford. G.M. Canada said it ''looks forward to continuing with the constructive dialogue.''
.Because the vast majority of Canadian auto production is shipped to the United States, any factory closings would be disruptive for the two automakers at a time of brisk auto sales.
Chrysler builds all of its minivans, as well as the Volkswagen Routan, in Windsor, Ontario. Its large rear-wheel-drive cars -- the Chrysler 300, the Dodge Charger and the Challenger -- come exclusively from a factory outside of Toronto in Brampton, Ontario.
G.M.'s plants in Oshawa, Ontario, make the Chevrolet Camaro, the new Cadillac XTS, the Chevrolet Impala and the Buick Regal. Some production of the Chevrolet Equinox, a popular small sport utility model, also comes from Oshawa.
Stacey Allerton, the vice president for human resources of Ford Motor Company of Canada, which is based in Oakville, said the four-year agreement, which is subject to ratification by Ford workers, provided a ''unique to Canada solution that will improve the competitiveness of the Canadian operations while providing employees the opportunity to earn a good living.''
The rise of the Canadian dollar to parity with the United States dollar has eliminated the cost advantage once enjoyed by Canadian plants and made labor costs higher in Canada. General Motors has said that Canada now has the highest costs in the world to assemble cars and trucks.
The automakers, and Chrysler in particular, want the Canadian union to adopt a system long established at American plants under which new employees work at a lower wage rate. In Canada, workers start at a lower rate, but gradually move up to the same scale as established employees.
Ford agreed to continue with that system after some compromises from the union. New employees will now have to wait 10 years, rather than six, to move to full wages and they will start at 60 percent of the full rate rather than 70 percent as was the case in the last contract.
The sides found a similar compromise on the issue of pensions. Like many companies in Canada and in the United States, the automakers had sought to replace the defined-benefit pensions with defined-contribution plans. Defined-benefit pensions guarantee a set payment, while defined-contribution plans guarantee the employer's payments, leaving the benefits subject to investment decisions and the investment environment.
In the tentative agreement with Ford, the union agreed to a hybrid pension that would be a combination of the two systems. That will create some uncertainty about benefits for its members and also increase the amount of pension payments they make. The union's members started making pension contributions only after signing their last contract in 2009.
To make Ford's costs more predictable, the union has agreed to a series of predetermined, lump-sum payments in place of wage increases based on the rate of inflation. There are no wage increases at all in the contract.
Ford will rehire 230 workers shortly by introducing what Mr. Lewenza called a ''partial third shift'' in Oakville. When a new model arrives in 2014, the company plans to increase employment by about 300 jobs. The remainder of the job recalls will be created by ending outsourcing of some tasks and partial vehicle assemblies.

HEADLINE: Shares Slip After a Turbulent Spell in Oil Trading

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Monday in light trading as falling oil prices affected energy shares.
The decline broke a four-day streak of gains for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. On Friday, both the Dow and the S.& P. ended at highs not reached since December 2007. 
Financials, which were among the biggest gainers late last week, were among sectors leading the day's decline. The S.& P. financial index fell 1 percent. Bank of America shares lost 2.6 percent to $9.30.
An S.& P. index of energy shares fell 0.8 percent, slipping along with oil prices, which tumbled sharply in afternoon trading. Exxon Mobil shed 0.4 percent to percent to $91.91.
A regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said the agency was looking into the trades behind the price plunge and was in contact with the exchanges.
Brent crude, which had settled at $116.66 a barrel on Friday, sank from $115.20 at 1:52 p.m. to $111.60 three minutes later as trading volumes, which had been muted by the Rosh Hashana holiday, shot up.
''I've been doing this for 14 years and that's the fastest move I've ever seen,'' said John Gretzinger, energy risk manager at INTL-FCStone in Kansas City, Mo.
The CME Group, the primary market for crude oil trading in the United States, said it was unaware of any technical issue that might have contributed to the selling on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Scott D. O'Malia, a commissioner at the C.F.T.C., said the regulator was looking at what might have been behind the sudden price plunge.
Brent November crude closed down $2.87 at $113.79 a barrel.
In New York, November light crude fell $2.38 to settle at $96.95 a barrel.
The stock market's losses were limited by Apple, which hit another record high of $699.80 with demand for its new iPhone 5 exceeding initial supply. At the close, Apple's stock was up 1.2 percent at $699.78.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 40.27 points, or 0.30 percent, to end at 13,553.10. The Standard & Poor's 500 shed 4.58 points, or 0.31 percent, to 1,461.19. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 5.28 points, or 0.17 percent, to close at 3,178.67.
The day's economic data offered more evidence of weakness. Factory activity in New York State contracted for a second month in a row in September
Investors also focused on turmoil overseas. In Afghanistan and Indonesia, demonstrations continued over a film mocking Muhammad.
The day's deal news included the announcement by the Lowe's Companies that it had withdrawn its proposal to buy Rona, a Canadian home improvement retailer.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 7/32, to 94 13/32, and the yield fell to 1.84 percent from 1.87 percent late Friday.

BYLINE: By AMY ZIPKIN

 BODY:
The description of the meeting center was effusive: ''The conference center has a million-dollar panoramic view of the Manhattan skyline that will leave you breathless.''
But this was not for some fancy hotel. It was for the center at Montclair State University in New Jersey, less than 20 miles west of Manhattan. Montclair, like hundreds of colleges and universities around the country, has experienced increased interest in its conference centers as companies seek more frugal sites for their corporate meetings.
''It's a question of optics,'' said Kristin Kurie, president of the Wilderman Group in Charleston, S.C., a company that manages meeting and event sites. ''Companies don't want to appear to be spending lavishly.'' 
Chuck Salem, president of Unique Venues in Johnstown, Pa., a referral service for about 500 college and university conference centers, said he had seen a rise in inquiries in the last several years. In 2009, he said, his staff followed up on 2,087 leads. By 2011, that number had jumped to 9,721, with 55 percent from corporate or business planners.
For their part, many colleges and universities have long had conference centers, though they were primarily for academic conferences. Now, they are eager to find new sources of funds.
''There's a built-in market,'' said David E. Arnold, co-president and chief executive of PKF Consulting East Coast, a hospitality management consultant in Philadelphia. Not only do the collegiate conference centers make money by marketing to outside groups, he said, they can also burnish a university's image.
The hotel industry, which has had its own struggles in an uneven economy, has taken note of the push by colleges to increase the appeal of their conference centers. ''Financing is tough to get, and we're not seeing new hotels in the pipeline,'' said Joseph A. McInerney, president and chief executive of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, a trade group based in Washington. This has left an opening for the universities, he said. ''Hotels have to show their value is better than conference centers.''
Campuses in urban centers like Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia are popular, Mr. Salem said. And during the summer, some customers ''are eating in dining halls, sleeping in residence halls, and meeting in classrooms,'' he said.
The rest of the year, companies may use the college conference center for day meetings and area hotels for overnight lodging. (University-based conference centers with sleeping accommodations are the exception, among them Georgetown, Villanova and the Knight Executive Education Center at Washington University in St. Louis. All are managed by Aramark, a company specializing in food and facilities management.)
The director of the Montclair conference center, Robert Foreman, said the gushing description of the center, which appears on Unique Venues' Web site, has paid off. Within the last year, the site has attracted a gathering of Apple retail managers, a regional meeting of Panera Bread and a runway event for Justin Alexander Bridal, a wedding gown maker.
The Panera gathering was a quarterly business meeting to recognize the one-year anniversary of a franchise operation's becoming company-owned. Panera's chairman and co-chief executive, Ronald M. Shaich, made a surprise appearance.
The company was impressed by the state-of-the-art audio visual equipment, said Linn Parrish, vice president for public relations at Panera. In addition, she said, ''The attendees felt they had been in a learning environment rather than just another business meeting.''
For Justin Alexander, the location was just 20 minutes from its office in Pine Brook, N.J.
Universities have been contacting companies like Sodexo, a subsidiary of the French Sodexo Group, with its headquarters in Gaithersburg, Md., to manage and promote their conference centers. Rush Sherman, vice president for operations for campus services in the Northeast at Sodexo, said the company concluded that campuses were not running at capacity during the summer and saw an opportunity. ''There's a lot of space and also financial need,'' he said.
It began an initiative in March called Campus Conference Solutions that now works with 20 campuses in the Northeast. He said he expected the program to ''spread to other locations across the country where it makes sense.''
During the summer, Sodexo expects to compete with established conference centers and hotels on both price and location. Lodging costs in dormitories will range from $30 to $50 a person a night. Three meals are expected to run $25 to $30 a day. ''You can't touch that at a hotel,'' Norma Charette, director of conference sales for Sodexo for campus solutions. ''That's breakfast at a hotel.''
Still, experts say the Sodexo decision comes with risks. Mr. Arnold pointed out that the university conference centers ''are individual centers -- you can't necessarily make a brand.''
With sleeping space on campuses at a premium during the school year, many campus conference centers look to nearby hotels. Such is the case at the University of Delaware in Newark. A Courtyard Marriott, owned by the university, but managed separately, is less than a mile from campus.
The university's conference center, Clayton Hall, serves a local and regional clientele. A 2011 study by PKF Consulting USA and the International Association of Conference Centers estimated that over 75 percent of college and university conferences come from local or regional groups.
Polly Weir, the University of Delaware director of conferences, said the aesthetics of the center can put off some people. ''It's not as flashy as hotels,'' she said.
But Colin Greene, senior director of the Gleacher Center at the University of Chicago, said a site dedicated to business makes sense for corporate meetings. ''There are no tourists in the lobby or guests in swimsuits,'' he said.

HEADLINE: France Voices Concerns on BAE and EADS Merger

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
LONDON -- The French finance minister on Monday laid out a series of concerns that would have to be addressed before France signs off on the proposed merger of the defense giants European Aeronautic Defense & Space and BAE Systems. 
Speaking in London, Pierre Moscovici, the French minister for economy and finance, said the government was examining the plans along with Germany and was ''asking a lot of questions.''
The main concerns, he said, focused on ''the strategic interest of such a merger, the industrial effect, the possible synergies between the two companies and the governance of the entity,'' Mr. Moscovici said after having met with the British chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. He added that the issues of the ''future of our defense industry and employment in France'' were also being examined.
''These are the questions we raise,'' he added. ''We will examine this proposal on the light of the answer to these questions. It will take time and we will do that alongside our German friends.''
BAE Systems and EADS, two of Europe's largest aerospace and military companies, confirmed Wednesday that they were in advanced discussions about a possible merger to create one of the largest players in the defense industry.
Under the terms of the proposed deal, shareholders of EADS would own 60 percent of the combined company, while BAE shareholders would control the remaining 40 percent. The combined market value of the companies is roughly $50 billion.
Mr. Moscovici hinted that the French government had been aware of the merger discussions for some time. One issue thought to concern the French is the treatment of the golden shares France, Germany and Britain hold in EADS. The current arrangements give France and Germany significant control over key decisions within the company.
According to media reports, the merger plans would give France, Germany and Britain golden shares in the new company sufficient to block a hostile takeover, but would limit influence over other decisions. BAE has described those reports as speculative and has said no decision had yet been made on the size of the stakes to be awarded to the three governments.
In an era of tightening defense budgets, many analysts say that a consolidation among contractors in Europe makes sense. However, such a merger raises questions about where jobs would be concentrated and whether the strategic and industrial interests of all the European countries involved could be reconciled.
Another factor is the reaction of the United States. There are worries the United States would be less likely to award contracts to a company like EADS in which France has a large holding as opposed to BAE, which is British owned. France is not as close a defense ally as Britain.
''Under the transaction structure being discussed between the parties, BAE Systems and EADS envisage that certain of their defense activities would be ringfenced with governance arrangements appropriate to their strategic and national security importance, particularly in the U.S.A., given the importance of that market to the enlarged group,'' BAE said in a statement Sept. 12.

HEADLINE: How To Fix The Schools

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
No matter how quickly the Chicago teachers' strike ends, whether it is this afternoon or two months from now, it's not going to end well for the city's public school students. Yes, I know; that's the hoariest of clichs. But that doesn't mean it's not true.
It's not just the school days that are being lost. Far more important, the animosity between the Chicago Teachers Union and Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his administration will undoubtedly linger long after the strike ends. The battle will end, but the war between education reformers and urban public schoolteachers will go on. 
Teachers -- many of them -- will continue to resent efforts to use standardized tests to measure their ability to teach. Their leaders -- some of them -- will denounce the ''billionaire hedge fund managers'' who are financing many of the reform efforts. Reformers will continue to view teachers' unions as the greatest roadblock to higher student achievement. How can such a poisonous atmosphere not affect what goes on in the classroom? Alienated labor is never a good thing. ''It is not possible to make progress with your students if you are at war with your teachers,'' says Marc Tucker.
Tucker, 72, a former senior education official in Washington, is the president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, which he founded in 1988. Since then he has focused much of his research on comparing public education in the United States with that of places that have far better results than we do -- places like Finland, Japan, Shanghai and Ontario, Canada. His essential conclusion is that the best education systems share common traits -- almost none of which are embodied in either the current American system or in the reform ideas that have gained sway over the last decade or so. He can sound frustrated when he talks about it.
''We have to find a way to work with teachers and unions while at the same time working to greatly raise the quality of teachers,'' he told me recently. He has some clear ideas about how to go about that. His starting point is not the public schools themselves but the universities that educate teachers. Teacher education in America is vastly inferior to many other countries; we neither emphasize pedagogy -- i.e., how to teach -- nor demand mastery of the subject matter. Both are a given in the top-performing countries. (Indeed, it is striking how many nonprofit education programs in the U.S. are aimed at helping working teachers do a better job -- because they've never learned the right techniques.)
What is also a given in other countries is that teaching has a status equal to other white-collar professionals. That was once true in America, but Tucker believes that a quarter-century of income inequality saw teachers lose out at the expense of lawyers and other well-paid professionals. That is a large part of the reason that teachers' unions have become so obstreperous: It is not just that they feel underpaid, but they feel undervalued. Tucker believes that teachers should be paid more -- though not exorbitantly. But making teacher education more rigorous -- and imbuing the profession with more status -- is just as important. ''Other countries have raised their standards for getting into teachers' colleges,'' he told me. ''We need to do the same.''
Second, he believes that it makes no sense to demonize unions. ''If you look at the countries with the highest performance, many of them have very strong unions. There is no correlation between the strength of the unions and student achievement,'' he says.
Instead, he points to the example of Ontario, where a decade ago, a new government decided to embrace the teachers' unions -- to treat them as partners instead of as adversaries. The result? Ontario now has some of the best student achievement in the world. (Alas, relations between teachers and the government have recently deteriorated after a two-year wage freeze was imposed.)
High-performing countries don't abandon teacher standards. On the contrary. Teachers who feel part of a collaborative effort are far more willing to be evaluated for their job performance -- just like any other professional. It should also be noted that none of the best-performing countries rely as heavily as the U.S. does on the blunt instrument of standardized tests. That is yet another lesson we have failed to learn.
The Chicago teachers' strike exemplifies, in stark terms, how misguided the battle over education has become. The teachers are fighting for the things industrial unions have always fought for: seniority, favorable work rules and fierce resistance to performance measures. City Hall is fighting to institute reforms no top-performing country has ever seen fit to use, and which probably won't make much difference if they are instituted.
The answer lies elsewhere -- in a different approach to teaching education and to dealing with the unions. It won't be easy, but it is not impossible. It's the way forward.

HEADLINE: Protests and Arrests on Anniversary of Occupy Wall Street Movement

BYLINE: By COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
Updated, 9:05 p.m. | More than 150 people were arrested on Monday as protesters tried to block access to the New York Stock Exchange on the first anniversary of the Occupy Wall Street protests.
Demonstrators had planned to converge from several directions and form what was called the People's Wall around the stock exchange to protest what they said was an unfair economic system that benefited the rich and corporations at the expense of ordinary citizens.
Last year, protesters took over Zuccotti Park, not far from Wall Street, setting up an encampment that became an inspiration for similar Occupy campaigns around the world. But after being evicted from the park in November, the protests lost much of their energy, though their message of economic inequality has resonated in Washington and in the presidential campaign. 
On Monday, the police countered the blockade planned by protesters with one of their own, ringing the streets and sidewalks leading toward the exchange with metal barricades and asking for identification from workers seeking access.
Protesters marched though the streets, waving banners and banging drums while accompanied by bands playing "Happy Birthday."
At several points during the morning, crowds of protesters numbering in the hundreds briefly blocked intersections before being dispersed, with arrests in some instances.
Though organizers said more than 1,000 people participated in the demonstration, the roving groups did not appear to cause much disruption on Wall Street.
By early evening, 181 people had been arrested, the police said.
Although officers sometimes surrounded large groups of protesters, they did not appear to make mass arrests. But on several occasions, officers plunged onto sidewalks packed with protesters and arrested people after saying the crowds were blocking pedestrian traffic.
At one point, at Broad and Beaver Streets, a commander grabbed a man from a crowd standing on the corner. Protesters tried to pull the man back, but officers surged into the crowd and wrested the man away, placing him in handcuffs.
One of the more turbulent episodes took place along Broadway where several hundred people marched. Officers approached a man who had been yelling objections to the metal police barricades that cordoned off Wall Street. When the officers grabbed the man, he began shouting "I did nothing wrong," but they removed him.
As they were leading the man away, a line of officers pushed away a large crowd of people, including news photographers. One officer repeatedly shoved news photographers with a baton, and a police lieutenant shouted at one point that no more photographs would be permitted, adding, "That's over."
Organizers said they had planned the protest to show that the Occupy movement still had vitality and to express continuing frustration with the economic environment.
Among those gathering early Monday was Oren Goldberg, 32, of Bushwick, Brooklyn, who said he had joined the protest partly because he felt the need to somehow register his conviction that the financial system was not operating properly.
"It's exciting to see any group of people attempting any sort of change," he said, adding that Occupy participants were interested in "working toward a greater good than profiteering."
As the protesters gathered as early as 6 a.m., police vans were parked on side streets throughout the financial district, and helicopters buzzed overhead. Men in suits walking to work passed contingents of officers posted on corners.
Sporadic marches continued through the afternoon, along with arrests.
Several demonstrations took place outside financial institutions. Some people were arrested at a Bank of America branch opposite Zuccotti Park. Later the police arrested about a half-dozen people who sat down in front of Goldman Sachs headquarters on West Street while a crowd chanted "arrest the bankers."
As the police directed the crowd to leave the area, people in the building could be seen gazing down from windows. Some of the protesters pointed up to the windows and shouted, "Goldman Sachs, we'll be back," as they began marching toward Zuccotti Park.
As night fell, a few hundred protesters gathered in the park. Their numbers declined, however, after dozens of police officers and private security guards walked through the park and trained powerful spotlights on those inside.
At one point, as the police arrested a woman inside Zuccotti Park, an officer told a city councilman, Jumaane D. Williams, to get down from a granite bench. Mr. Williams refused, saying he was a Council member and wanted to observe. After Mr. Williams refused a second order to get down, two officers shoved him with batons, knocking him off the bench.
Joseph Goldstein contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Lowe's Ends Effort to Acquire Rona, Its Canadian Rival

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
5:55 p.m. | Updated OTTAWA - The home improvement retailer Lowe's on Monday abandoned its $1.8 billion hostile bid for its Canadian competitor Rona, a move that avoids a political showdown with the government in Quebec.
Rona, which is based in Quebec, and Lowe's began apparently friendly discussions as early as July 2011. That led to an offer last December, which was rejected by Rona's board but not disclosed by either company at the time. 
In a statement on Monday, Lowe's offered no specific reason for its decision to abandon the bid.
"Lowe's has repeatedly attempted to engage the board of directors of Rona with respect to its proposal in order to conduct confirmatory due diligence and move forward with a friendly, negotiated transaction," Lowe's said.
In a rare point of agreement, both the Liberal Party, which lost an election this month in Quebec, and the separatist Parti Qubcois, which will form the province's next government, spoke out strongly against the deal despite commitments from Lowe's to maintain a Canadian head office in Quebec and to cultivate Canadian suppliers.
Despite the deal's collapse, Lowe's continued to promote what it saw as the deal's benefits.
"A combination of Lowe's and Rona makes business sense and would create significant value for all stakeholders," Lowe's said. "It is unfortunate that the Rona board of directors did not recognize the important economic and commercial benefits of this proposal."
Canada's real estate and mortgage markets largely escaped the turmoil that hit the United States in 2008, making expansion in Canada attractive for Lowe's and other American retailers. Target is in the process of opening its first Canadian stores, and last week Nordstrom announced it would open its first four locations in Canada.
Some credit analysts also expressed reservations about the added debt Lowe's would assume if it bought Rona. Many equity analysts wondered how Lowe's would incorporate Rona's hodgepodge of store sizes and concepts.
Rona owns 61 big-box outlets similar to Lowe's and Home Depot. But Rona also owns 178 small stores, and an additional 374 stores are franchised or owned by independent dealers. The owners of those stores were among the takeover's strongest opponents.
The dealers' prominence in small towns in Quebec seemed to feed the move to keep Rona independent. That sentiment was less noticeable in the rest of Canada, and the Lowe's bid was favorably viewed by most of the investment community outside of Quebec.
Lowe's hostile bid put Caisse de Dpt et Placement du Qubec, which manages a variety of government-related investment funds, in an awkward position.
The fund, which held 12 percent of Rona's shares when Lowe's began its bid and then increased that stake to 14 percent, operates at arm's length from the government.
But it also has a mandate to promote the province's economy and businesses while ensuring healthy returns.
Now that Rona's board and management have fended off Lowe's bid, they will be under increased pressure to show that the company's reorganization plan is working. On Monday several analysts predicted that Lowe's might return with a third bid for Rona.
"Given a slowing Canadian housing market and outlook for sluggish consumer spending, we expect Rona's results - notably top line - to remain pressured and we would therefore expect a certain level of shareholder support for a transaction, at an appropriate price," Irene Nattel of RBC Capital Markets, a unit of the Royal Bank of Canada, wrote in an investment note.
In an e-mail, Rona said that it had learned about Lowe's decision through a news release. "Our focus is on the implementation of our business plan based on the renewal of our offer to consumers," wrote Valrie Lamarre, a spokeswoman, referring to the reorganization plan. "This focus remains."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Occupy Wall Street: A Frenzy That Fizzled

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
It will be an asterisk in the history books, if it gets a mention at all.
A year ago this week, the Occupy Wall Street movement got under way in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan. The loose group of protesters, frustrated by the economic downturn, sought to blame Wall Street and corporate America for many of the nation's ills.
While the movement's first days did not receive much news coverage, it soon turned into a media frenzy, with some columnists comparing its importance to that of the Arab Spring, which led to the overthrow of leaders in several Middle Eastern and African countries, spurred by social media. Images of the Wall Street protesters getting arrested were looped on news channels and featured on the covers of newspapers. Big banks - and the famous Charging Bull statue that is an icon of Wall Street - were fortified with barricades. By the end of the year, Time magazine had named the protester its Person of the Year, perhaps rightly given the revolutions taking place around the world, but the magazine also lumped Occupy Wall Street in among the many meaningful movements taking place. 
But now, 12 months later, it can and should be said that Occupy Wall Street was - perhaps this is going to sound indelicate - a fad.
That is not to say that Occupy Wall Street had no impact. It created an important national conversation about economic inequality and upward mobility. The chant, "We are the 99 percent," has become part of the lexicon. Its message has subtly been woven throughout the Obama administration's re-election campaign, in the Democrats' position on everything from taxes on the highest earners to the soaring levels of student debt.
But consider this: Has the debate over breaking up the banks that were too big to fail, save for a change of heart by the former chairman of Citigroup, Sanford I. Weill, really changed or picked up steam as a result of Occupy Wall Street? No. Have any new regulations for banks or businesses been enacted as a result of Occupy Wall Street? No. Has there been any new meaningful push to put Wall Street executives behind bars as a result of Occupy Wall Street? No.
And even on the issues of economic inequality and upward mobility - perhaps Occupy Wall Street's strongest themes - has the movement changed the debate over executive compensation or education reform? It is not even a close call.
Is there still anger and angst over the horrible unemployment problem in the United States? Absolutely. But that sentiment, and whatever conversation has emerged as result, was going to happen with or without Occupy Wall Street.
The Wall Street banks themselves hardly felt the pinch of the protesters, beyond considering them a nuisance and an additional security cost. Despite campaigns for customers to move money to smaller, community banks, few customers did.
The biggest victory, perhaps, that the movement can claim was a decision by Bank of America and other big banks to scrap plans to charge additional fees for use of debit cards. The protesters also brought awareness to banks' foreclosure practices, and even successfully petitioned to keep some struggling borrowers in their homes.
Back in the fall of 2011, questioning anything about the movement was not too popular. Doing so was an invitation for withering ridicule. (I experienced it firsthand after I filed what I thought was a relatively respectful column about the protests from Zuccotti Park.)
The problem with the movement, as many other columnists have pointed out before, was that its mission was always intentionally vague. It was deliberately leaderless. It never sought to become a political party or even a label like the Tea Party.
By the second or third time I went down to Zuccotti Park it became clear to me that Occupy Wall Street, which began with a small band of passionate intellectuals, had been hijacked by misfits and vagabonds looking for food and shelter.
Given the way the organization - if it can be called that - was purposely open to taking all comers, the assembly lost its sense of purpose as various intramural squabbles emerged about the group's end game.
I vividly remember watching one protester with a sign that read "Google = Jewish Billionaires." Another protester ran over and ripped up the poster. The messages had become decidedly too mixed.
Eliot L. Spitzer, the former New York governor and former attorney general who has been a longtime supporter of Occupy Wall Street, recently reflected on the legacy of the movement.
"They are redefining and rebalancing our political discourse," he wrote in Slate. "To all those who are dissatisfied because the Occupy movement did not grow into the complete political theory or social agenda that some wished, I say: Give credit where credit is due."
Fair enough. But even Mr. Spitzer questioned, "We do have to ask, 'Now what?' "

HEADLINE: A Pier to Pay for a Park

 BODY:
New Yorkers cherish their access to the piers and green spaces that make up the Hudson River Park, which stretches from Pier 99 near 59th St. to Battery Place. Established by state law in 1998, the park gives urbanites a chance to stroll along one the nation's great rivers. 
The park was initially underwritten by the city and state with the understanding that, in time, there would be enough commercial development to help pay for its upkeep. The problem now is that one of the largest sources of revenue -- Pier 40, which has a huge parking garage that has generated about one-third of the park's maintenance budget -- is crumbling.
Bits of the roof are falling, stairs are rusting, pilings are decaying and the Hudson River Park Trust, which runs the park, is closing unsafe areas -- including one of three playing fields. City, state and park leaders will have to figure out a way to save this pier from being claimed by the river.
They will also have to devise new uses for the pier that will guarantee a steady stream of revenue. Under the law, half the 15-acre site must be public space or play areas and the other half commercial ventures. But the law should be liberalized to expand the kinds of development permitted on the pier and to extend the term of the leases, now limited to 30 years.
Two earlier proposals -- including one for a retail complex and theater housing Cirque du Soleil -- have been defeated mostly by community opposition. Park advocates and the deputy mayor for economic development, Robert Steel, believe the law should be broadened to include such possibilities as office space, a hotel or other developments.
Even if the law is changed to allow more commercial uses, any new proposal would have to address issues of height, noise, traffic, as any major development proposal would, as well as conform to the original vision of the park as a place primarily for public enjoyment. But the worst alterative would be to do nothing.
State legislators, like Assembly members Richard Gottfried and Deborah Glick, whose districts include large parts of the park, should figure out a way to save Pier 40. Without it, the park itself could be in peril.

HEADLINE: When Stars Were Just a Stamp Away

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
I was recently rooting around in the crawl space under the house and came across two old letters that moved me greatly.
The first was postmarked Aug. 10, 1938, from Larchmont, N.Y. It was to my father, from one of baseball's great players, Lou Gehrig. For many years, starting in the mid-1930s, my father supported himself as a freelance sports writer. This was the Depression -- he never made a lot of money and until going off to fight in World War II, he lived at home with his parents. Because he couldn't afford to travel around interviewing ballplayers, he would type up questionnaires and mail bundles of them, with three-cent, self-addressed envelopes, to major league stadiums all over the country.
It was, as they say, a different world. Even the stars answered. On the top of one of my father's questionnaires, Lou Gehrig wrote: ''Please pardon long delay. I just got to your letter. Sincerely, LG.'' 
My father's questions were short and to the point, and so were Gehrig's answers: Favorite pastime on long train trips? (bridge); Favorite sports except baseball? (reading, fishing); Greatest old time players? (Wagner, Cobb, Ruth); Favorite movie star? (Irene Dunn); Strangest article you ever autographed? ("You'd be surprised!")
Greatest off the diamond thrill (if it occurred while you were hunting or fishing, please specify where and when)? ("Meeting and marrying Mrs. Gehrig.") (Read the full questionnaire.)
In this manner, my father learned that Jackie Robinson's favorite comic strip was Dick Tracy; Babe Herman's favorite meal was a New York cut sirloin steak for two; Bob Feller's favorite movie star was Joe E. Brown; and Mace Brown's favorite sweet was his wife's lemon pie.
When my father came home from the war in 1946, he wanted to be a writer, with a capital ''W.'' By then, a few of his pieces had been published in major magazines of the time, including The Saturday Evening Post and Collier's.
So he and my mother made what they called their five-year plan. Though they were both 33, they would wait five years to start a family, to see if my father could make it.
I was born in 1951, when my mother was 38. She was 40 when she had my brother. Time was up. My father took a job as a copy editor at The Quincy Patriot Ledger. He continued to do a little freelancing on the side for second-tier magazines, like 1,000 Jokes and For Laughing Out Loud, selling them short humor pieces and one-liners for pocket money. But it was settled: he was a newspaperman, not a writer.
Writers support themselves writing.
Like many men and women of that era, my father never earned enough money to live in a house with a second bathroom.
But my parents saved every penny -- picnics at highway rest areas, no Howard Johnson's for us -- and were very proud to be able to send us to elite colleges. My brother would go on to become a lawyer, and that was my plan, too. But for some reason I don't recall, in my junior year of college, I went out for the school paper.
When I graduated in 1974, I, too, wanted to be a writer. But for as long as I could remember, my mother had cautioned against it. ''Look at all those years your father wasted,'' she'd say, and it stuck. I took a job as a newspaperman in Rochester, N.Y., then worked my way up, from one bigger paper to the next.
In the years that followed, I wrote a nonfiction book and three children's novels that were all well reviewed, but they never earned me the quitting money I'd hoped for.
And so, 38 years later, I, like my father before me, am a newspaperman.
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone coming out of college. The industry is bleeding to death, the work is never done. In the history of mankind, there has never been a day without news. As I write, it's 2 a.m. Sometimes the muse doesn't strike between 9 and 5. When I came into the business, editors would apologize if they had to bother me on the weekend. Now I apologize for not getting back sooner. My editor and I exchange e-mails at midnight, and again at 7 a.m.
Don't get me wrong. I still love a lot of it and given what's going on with the economy, I count myself lucky.
Still, I was thankful that growing up, my four children never expressed an interest. They'd seen behind the curtain, the long hours, the calls in the middle of dinner, the tension it all created.
Last Sunday, one of my sons, a junior in college, went to an organizing meeting of the school paper. He's excited about his first assignment.
When I was a new parent, I was sure I could influence what my children would become. The older I get, the less I believe so. Now I think maybe a little bit around the edges.
I might not recommend what my son is doing, but I do understand it.
And that brings me to the second dusty old letter I found under the house. It was a letter to my father postmarked January 1985.
My father died in 1980.
Inside was a form letter from something called ''The Comedy Center.''
''Thanks so much for the one-liners you submitted,'' the yellow paper said.
Included was a check for $5.
I think that's why my father wrote, and why I write, and the reason maybe my son will. We hope to create something more than what we are, something that might endure, even though in the end, it may just be a clever one-liner.
The form letter concluded, ''Please keep writing and send your material to the address below.''
I never cashed the $5 check. It was worth too much.
PHOTOS: In simpler times, players -- like Lou Gehrig, above, and Jackie Robinson -- would answer a journalist's questions via mail. Gehrig even apologized for his delayed response.

HEADLINE: Instant Internet Heroes

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Ore. -- An effort to build a sleek aluminum charging dock for the iPhone generated fervor online when it was announced last December. The project's creators raised close to $1.5 million through Kickstarter, a crowdfunding Web site, and promised to start shipping their Elevation Dock in April to those who had backed the project.
But last week Apple announced a redesigned iPhone that is not compatible with the dock -- and because of manufacturing delays, some of the project's original backers were still waiting to receive theirs. The designers are now scrambling to make an adapter and update the product.
''I'm just hoping to get mine before the iPhone 6 ships at this point,'' one backer wrote on Kickstarter. 
Crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and IndieGogo are letting designers and other creative people connect with audiences who want to finance their dreams, and they are becoming increasingly popular. Nearly three million people have helped a total of 30,000 projects meet their fund-raising goals on Kickstarter, the largest such site, to the tune of $300 million in pledges.
But for the creators of these projects, getting the money is sometimes the easy part. They then have to turn their dreams into reality, with a crowd keeping an eye on their progress.
This new model comes with a host of potential pitfalls that are often difficult for project creators to anticipate, and hard for the armchair philanthropists who back them to grasp. Backers are essentially putting their trust in the project creators, giving them cash in return for the promise of a future reward.
Those who give a few dollars to a moviemaking project may get their names in the credits, while someone who puts up $100 to support development of a smart wristwatch might be promised one of the finished items.
Much of the time this works out. But some projects, including several prominent and in-demand ones, have run into missteps and lengthy delays. The permits for a new food truck might not come through. Or a gadget like the Elevation Dock might be harder than expected to manufacture and ship.
The rise of crowdfunding came up often over the weekend here at the debut of the XOXO Festival, a conference that focused on new models and outlets for creativity on the Internet. The conference was co-founded by an early Kickstarter employee, Andy Baio, who sold $400 tickets on Kickstarter itself to gauge interest in the event and raise money for it.
The relationship between creators and backers on crowdfunding sites is still being worked out. The backers play the role of philanthropists, investors, customers -- or all of the above. And when promised rewards are slow to materialize, eager backers can get cranky.
''It's definitely a lot of pressure,'' said Eric Migicovsky, whose Kickstarter project to create a line of ''Pebble'' wristwatches with innovative displays raised more than $10 million -- more than 10 times what he had hoped to get. ''There are 65,000 people who have preordered a watch that doesn't yet exist.''
Mr. Migicovsky hired someone to help manage his in-box -- nearly 9,000 people have e-mailed him about the project -- and to post updates. He originally hoped to start shipping the watches in September, a date that he has had to push back, although he declined to say by how much.
A study by Ethan Mollick, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, found that 75 percent of design- and technology-related projects on Kickstarter, most of which involve physical products, failed to meet their promised deadlines. In general, project backers seem to be understanding of hiccups and willing to wait as long as they are kept informed.
''The honeymoon period that we are experiencing around crowdfunding is beginning to come to a close,'' said Wil Schroeter, co-founder and chief executive of Fundable, a company that is applying crowdfunding to the venture capital process. ''People realize there is real risk involved in investing in anything early-stage, whether it's an idea, a charity or a product, and they're starting to understand they aren't buying off of Amazon.''
Kickstarter says it is not responsible for making sure a project is completed on time, or at all. It says project creators are legally obligated to fulfill their promises, but if they do not, Kickstarter has no mechanism for refunding the money that was pledged. The project creators can refund the money if they choose.
Sometimes project creators can be overwhelmed by the success of a crowdfunding campaign.
The four college students behind Diaspora, a project that aimed to build an open alternative to Facebook, began with the modest goal of $10,000. They raised $200,000 from around 6,500 people. But after three years, they decided to start on another venture and turned the code over to anyone who might want to keep working on it. (One member of the team committed suicide last year.)
Max Salzberg, who was part of the team, said they had become so consumed with things like answering e-mails and making T-shirts for their contributors that they had little time to build the software.
''We thought this would be a summer project,'' Mr. Salzberg said. ''We wanted to make it because it was something we believed in, but we got roped into maintaining a relationship with a lot of people. We weren't prepared to have to deal with that.''
The hardest part, he said, was the perception they had squandered the money. ''It sounds like a lot of money, and people were like, 'Where did it go?' But the reality is that for four guys for two years, we scrounged.''
''Going viral was crippling,'' he said. ''It was mayhem.''
Some retrench before trouble hits. When Kelvin Geis had the idea to create a stylus for use with iPads last spring, he decided to put it up on Kickstarter. ''I just really wanted to see if I could make this thing work,'' said Mr. Geis, 41, who works in construction in Draper, Utah. ''But everything was so much more difficult than I'd anticipated.''
Mr. Geis found that he had drastically underestimated his manufacturing cost and the time it would take to make the stylus. He canceled his fund-raising, consulted designers and manufacturers, and put it back up a few months later. He wound up raising $35,000 in three weeks and shipped out his first order of 1,500 units a few months later.
Several projects on Kickstarter that began with modest goals have taken off and skyrocketed into the millions, sometimes in a matter of days. Yancey Strickler, one of the founders of Kickstarter and who spoke at the conference, said this phenomenon was new for the company, which introduced its site in 2009.
Kickstarter projects are ''primarily patronage,'' Mr. Strickler said. ''But as a product reaches a certain scale, a person is expected to be a corporation.''
''It's an economy that is being created by the minute,'' he said.
The Elevation Dock was the first Kickstarter campaign to soar past $1 million. Casey Hopkins, the project's founder, said his company would be selling an inexpensive adapter for those who ordered docks and wanted to use them with the iPhone 5.
Mr. Hopkins said that, over all, he was thrilled that he was able to create ''a business out of thin air'' through Kickstarter.
''When you're in the trenches, it's so incredibly stressful,'' he said. ''But I think we've done well.''
The company is close to shipping the last of its 19,000 preordered docks, Mr. Hopkins said.
''It's definitely been a huge net positive,'' he said. ''At least, it will be after I take a weeklong vacation.''

HEADLINE: Driving Safety, in Fits and Starts

BYLINE: By HANNAH FAIRFIELD

 BODY:
AMERICANS drive a staggering number of miles -- close to three trillion every year, according to the government. (That is half a light-year, or 120 million trips around the world.) And although traffic accidents remain a major public safety problem, the biggest killer of people ages 5 to 34, vehicle travel is far safer than it was a few decades ago. 
Several factors appear to account for the sharp decline in fatalities. Technology (like antilock brakes and air bags) and road behavior (like wearing seat belts and driving sober) have both improved greatly since 1950.
Americans almost always drive more each year than the previous one -- at least until recently, when the recession curtailed road habits. And the auto fatality rate has been decreasing since the 1960s, when cars with massive engines carried their unbuckled passengers on primarily two-lane roads.
The safety data is usually charted as deaths per miles traveled. But what happens when the metrics are teased apart, and familiar data is charted in an unfamiliar way?
Plotting the two most important variables against each other -- miles traveled versus deaths per 100,000 population -- yields a pattern that looks like a plateau followed by a steep drop. It evokes the theory of punctuated equilibrium, proposed by the paleontologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge, which suggests that instead of continuous gradual evolution, change occurs abruptly after periods of virtual standstill.
''You see fatalities drop after a breakthrough in new technologies or behaviors, and then plateau until the next one,'' said David L. Strickland, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. ''It takes time for new safety technologies to work their way into the whole fleet of cars on the road.''

HEADLINE: Widow Seeks to Unseat New Jersey Congressman Who Ousted Her Husband in '10

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Shelley Adler was still mourning her husband's death when the thought hit her: Why not run for his old Congressional seat? But when she approached her husband's longtime political adviser and close friend, he gently discouraged her.
''I told her it would be a difficult race,'' the adviser, Michael Muller, recalled. ''She was still grieving, and I asked her if she was prepared to handle all the work that goes into running and the possibility of losing. I really wanted her to think about what she was getting into.''
Ms. Adler, a Democrat and a former PTA president in Cherry Hill, N.J., would not be dissuaded. She jumped in and is now locked into one of the more intriguing House races in the country.
The man Ms. Adler is challenging, Representative Jon Runyan, is not just any Republican opponent. In 2010, Mr. Runyan, a former star lineman for the Philadelphia Eagles, rode a wave of Tea Party support to unseat Ms. Adler's husband, John H. Adler, in a big upset. 
Mr. Adler, a well-liked figure on Capitol Hill, had been planning to fight to regain his old seat when he died unexpectedly, in April 2011, at age 51, after undergoing emergency heart surgery. Now Ms. Adler is determined to carry on his plans, despite the odds.
''After losing your husband and love of your life, the possibility of losing a Congressional race pales in comparison,'' she explained.
Beyond the personal angles, the race for New Jersey's Third Congressional District carries political significance. Any hope that the Democratic Party has of retaking control of the House rests, analysts say, on whether the party can mount competitive races in districts like Mr. Runyan's, where President Obama won in 2008.
''They have to defeat Republican incumbents in Obama districts to get to the majority,'' said Nathan L. Gonzales, an editor at The Rothenberg Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter that tracks Congressional races.
Indeed, national Democratic organizations like Emily's List and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee are already getting behind Ms. Adler with money, workers and other campaign resources.
But Republicans are investing heavily in protecting incumbents, in an effort to reduce the number of targets available to Democrats as they seek to pick up the 25 seats they need to reclaim the majority in the House. In Mr. Runyan's case, national Republicans have opened a field office, with a staff, in his district.
The district itself stretches across central New Jersey, extending all the way from the Philadelphia suburbs to the New Jersey coast. For years, it has been a classic swing district. It went to Al Gore in 2000, George W. Bush in 2004 and Mr. Obama in 2008.
But Mr. Runyan gained a political edge as a result of redistricting last year -- a once-a-decade process to reshape Congressional boundaries to reflect population shifts.
Redistricting gave Mr. Runyan a new, more Republican constituency, and it cut heavily Democratic Cherry Hill, Ms. Adler's hometown and political base, out of the district completely.
In many ways, the themes in this race mirror those being debated in the presidential campaign.
Ms. Adler and her Democratic allies have pounded away at Mr. Runyan for supporting a House Republican budget proposal that would overhaul Medicare, the health care program for older Americans.
The Democratic attacks, which claim that the Republican budget would gut Medicare, have grown more persistent since the architect of that budget, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, was chosen as Mitt Romney's running mate.
Mr. Runyan has argued that Ms. Adler and her Democratic allies are not only distorting the issue but are actually the ones who would endanger Medicare. He points out that the Ryan plan makes long-term changes that prevent the program from going broke. He also notes that the proposed changes would not affect Americans who are 55 or older.
Taxes have also been a major point of debate.
Ms. Adler and her supporters have attacked Mr. Runyan for supporting a House Republican plan that would extend the Bush-era tax cuts not just for average Americans, but for millionaires as well. The Adler camp opposes extending tax cuts for millionaires at a time when middle-class families are struggling. But Mr. Runyan argues against raising taxes on anyone given the economy's fragile state. What has riveted people watching the race are not the political issues, but also the personal ones.
Mr. Adler had served a single term in the House before losing his seat to Mr. Runyan, whose candidacy had been widely underestimated, partly because of his political experience. Mr. Adler had been making plans to run for his old seat when he died from a bacterial infection after heart surgery.
After his death, Ms. Adler searched for ways to honor the memory of husband, whom she met when they were students at Harvard in the early 1980s.
In summer 2011, she began talking to her four sons and close friends about running for her husband's seat. Last January she announced her candidacy, leading some to describe the race as an effort to avenge her husband's loss.
But she says nothing could be further from the truth.
''Avenging a loss is not going to bring my husband back,'' she said. ''And I would do anything to bring my husband back.''
Republicans acknowledge that running against a widow who has engendered local sympathies presents a challenge when it comes to going on the attack.
Mr. Runyan said he had no intention of allowing the race to become nasty, even as he made note of attacks leveled at him in his last race, when his intelligence was called into question.
''It does not have to be personal,'' he said. ''And I would hope she does not go there either.''
Still, there have been some heated exchanges, largely focused on Cherry Hill's removal from the district. Ms. Adler has accused Republicans on the state's bipartisan redistricting commission of banding together to make sure that the new district favored Mr. Runyan.
''They pulled Cherry Hill out of the district so that I wouldn't run,'' she said. ''My house is one and a quarter miles from the new district line. It is political shenanigans.''
Mr. Runyan and his allies have made the most of the situation, all but pinning the carpetbagger label on Ms. Adler as they wonder aloud how she can hope to represent a district that she does not even live in.
''She can't even vote for herself,'' Mr. Runyan said. ''I think most people would scratch their heads about that one.''

HEADLINE: Thurston Howell Romney

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
Frank Bruni is off today.

 BODY:
In 1980, about 30 percent of Americans received some form of government benefits. Today, as Nicholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute has pointed out, about 49 percent do.
In 1960, government transfers to individuals totaled $24 billion. By 2010, that total was 100 times as large. Even after adjusting for inflation, entitlement transfers to individuals have grown by more than 700 percent over the last 50 years. This spending surge, Eberstadt notes, has increased faster under Republican administrations than Democratic ones.
There are sensible conclusions to be drawn from these facts. You could say that the entitlement state is growing at an unsustainable rate and will bankrupt the country. You could also say that America is spending way too much on health care for the elderly and way too little on young families and investments in the future. 
But these are not the sensible arguments that Mitt Romney made at a fund-raiser earlier this year. Romney, who criticizes President Obama for dividing the nation, divided the nation into two groups: the makers and the moochers. Forty-seven percent of the country, he said, are people ''who are dependent upon government, who believe they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to take care of them, who believe they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.''
This comment suggests a few things. First, it suggests that he really doesn't know much about the country he inhabits. Who are these freeloaders? Is it the Iraq war veteran who goes to the V.A.? Is it the student getting a loan to go to college? Is it the retiree on Social Security or Medicare?
It suggests that Romney doesn't know much about the culture of America. Yes, the entitlement state has expanded, but America remains one of the hardest-working nations on earth. Americans work longer hours than just about anyone else. Americans believe in work more than almost any other people. Ninety-two percent say that hard work is the key to success, according to a 2009 Pew Research Survey.
It says that Romney doesn't know much about the political culture. Americans haven't become childlike worshipers of big government. On the contrary, trust in government has declined. The number of people who think government spending promotes social mobility has fallen.
The people who receive the disproportionate share of government spending are not big-government lovers. They are Republicans. They are senior citizens. They are white men with high school degrees. As Bill Galston of the Brookings Institution has noted, the people who have benefited from the entitlements explosion are middle-class workers, more so than the dependent poor.
Romney's comments also reveal that he has lost any sense of the social compact. In 1987, during Ronald Reagan's second term, 62 percent of Republicans believed that the government has a responsibility to help those who can't help themselves. Now, according to the Pew Research Center, only 40 percent of Republicans believe that.
The Republican Party, and apparently Mitt Romney, too, has shifted over toward a much more hyperindividualistic and atomistic social view -- from the Reaganesque language of common citizenship to the libertarian language of makers and takers. There's no way the country will trust the Republican Party to reform the welfare state if that party doesn't have a basic commitment to provide a safety net for those who suffer for no fault of their own.
The final thing the comment suggests is that Romney knows nothing about ambition and motivation. The formula he sketches is this: People who are forced to make it on their own have drive. People who receive benefits have dependency.
But, of course, no middle-class parent acts as if this is true. Middle-class parents don't deprive their children of benefits so they can learn to struggle on their own. They shower benefits on their children to give them more opportunities -- so they can play travel sports, go on foreign trips and develop more skills.
People are motivated when they feel competent. They are motivated when they have more opportunities. Ambition is fired by possibility, not by deprivation, as a tour through the world's poorest regions makes clear.
Sure, there are some government programs that cultivate patterns of dependency in some people. I'd put federal disability payments and unemployment insurance in this category. But, as a description of America today, Romney's comment is a country-club fantasy. It's what self-satisfied millionaires say to each other. It reinforces every negative view people have about Romney.
Personally, I think he's a kind, decent man who says stupid things because he is pretending to be something he is not -- some sort of cartoonish government-hater. But it scarcely matters. He's running a depressingly inept presidential campaign. Mr. Romney, your entitlement reform ideas are essential, but when will the incompetence stop?

HEADLINE: The Consumer: Grappling With Details Of Medicare Proposals

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
When Claire Celsi's father-in-law died in July, the one thing her mother-in-law did not have to worry about was the $300,000 hospital bill. Medicare covered most of it.
But election-year proposals to transform Medicare into a so-called premium-support program, as proposed by Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, are making Ms. Celsi anxious about the health costs she may face in retirement. People age 55 and older would see no changes to their Medicare benefits under these plans.
But at 46, Ms. Celsi is well into her working life. She has contributed to Medicare and has been counting on it. 
"I'm 46; my husband is 52. At this stage of our lives, it's already too late to start building up an emergency medical fund that's big enough to pay for all the extra expenses we'd incur," Ms. Celsi said. "I looked at that hospital bill and thought, what if that was me and I didn't have Medicare? What would I do?"
Many health care consumers are wondering the same. But answers to their questions are hard to come by: The proposals keep changing, and some are short on details. No one is certain what health care costs will be in the coming years.
Still, it's clear the proposed changes would shift costs from the federal government to retirees. An early version of a Republican plan would have more than doubled out-of-pocket health expenses for older adults, to $12,500 in 2022, the Congressional Budget Office estimated. "All scenarios will require seniors to pay more," said Robert Moffit, senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization in Washington. To think otherwise, he said, "is a fantasy."
Under the current Republican plan, seniors would buy medical coverage from private insurers or from traditional Medicare, which would compete with private plans. Medicare beneficiaries would receive fixed amounts from the government to help pay the premiums. The amounts would vary with the recipient's income.
The strategy has been supported by conservatives in Congress since the early 1980s, and it has become a central issue in the presidential campaign. The restructuring would affect some of the most vulnerable Americans: the elderly, nearly half of whom live on less than $22,000 a year, and who already spend 16 to 22 percent of their income on health care. Many have dementia and other complex medical problems.
Proponents say that calling such a system a "voucher plan," as many critics have, is misleading.
"It gives a false impression that individuals will be left with a certificate to go out and fend for themselves in an unregulated market," which is not the case, Mr. Moffit said. "It's a defined-contribution system that operates within a very regulated health insurance market exchange, based on what exists in Medicare today."
Participating private health plans would have to offer coverage equivalent to traditional Medicare, for example, and would not be allowed to reject Medicare recipients. The underlying assumption is that private plans can cover older people at a lower cost than the government. But private insurers have not held health costs down in the private market, critics note, and there is no guarantee that the government's fixed contribution would keep pace with rising premium costs.
The Republican plan would "end Medicare as we know it," said Joe Baker, president of the Medicare Rights Center, a national nonprofit organization based in New York City.
A version of the Republican plan drafted in 2011 by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, now the Republican vice-presidential nominee, would have made private coverage the only option for older adults. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the private health plans would charge more than traditional Medicare: about $20,512 a year on average in 2022.
But the government subsidy would be set at only $8,000, adding $6,400 to a senior's annual out-of-pocket medical costs, according to analyses by the Commonwealth Fund and the Kaiser Family Foundation Program on Medicare Policy. Under the plan, medical costs would consume nearly half of the average senior's Social Security income.
Private health plans cost more than traditional Medicare, the Congressional Budget Office said, because they have higher administrative costs and pay higher rates to doctors and hospitals.
Under the current Republican proposal, the value of the government subsidy would be pegged, at least initially, to the cost of the second-cheapest insurance plan in the local market. Beneficiaries would have to pay more if they choose plusher plans, which could include traditional Medicare in some markets. Mr. Romney has said low-income people would receive more generous government support, while higher earners would get slightly less.
Critics say this plan might result in minimal government contributions for retirees in many areas, who would be able to afford only the most tightly managed plans.
Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, said that could mean "the premium is cheap, but you can't find the oncologist you need."
Where does that leave consumers like Ms. Celsi? Most premium-support proposals would exempt those about to turn 55 from changes. Though the average beneficiary in traditional Medicare currently gets free hospital insurance, he or she already has significant out-of-pocket expenses, including about $100 for outpatient coverage under Part B, co-payments or about $177 a month for a supplemental plan to cover co-pays and deductibles, and $33 a month on average for a drug plan under Part D.
But even those who remain enrolled in traditional Medicare might feel changes. Mr. Baker and other critics worry that if private insurance companies "cherry-pick" younger and healthier beneficiaries, the people left in traditional Medicare will be older and sicker, driving up costs for those who remain.
For younger Americans who would face a radically reshaped Medicare, like Ms. Celsi, the key question is how the government would set the level of the premium support, and whether it would keep pace with health care inflation. No one knows what the effect of inflation will be or whether politicians will choose to spend money to keep up.
Under some premium-support proposals, people might not be eligible for Medicare until age 67. That prospect, too, worries critics like Mr. Baker.
"We find people gasping to get to that Medicare finish line at 65 if they were laid off at 62 or 64," he said. "If you raise the age to 67, we'll have uninsured people over 65 for the first time in decades."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Car Country, Obama Trumpets China Trade Case

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Beijing, and Michael Barbaro from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
CINCINNATI -- In a vivid display of the powers of incumbency, President Obama on Monday filed a broad new trade case against China at the World Trade Organization, announcing the action in this industrial battleground where Mitt Romney has pressed his argument that the president has not done enough to protect American workers.
Administration officials said that the W.T.O. case, which charges China with unfairly subsidizing exports of cars and auto parts, was months in the making. But the timing, eight weeks before the election and days after Mr. Romney had renewed his attacks on Mr. Obama for his trade policy toward China, gives it potent political resonance.
On a day in which security and trade policy were inextricably mixed with the presidential campaign, the Chinese government, hours after word of the American action began circulating in Beijing, announced that it was filing its own W.T.O. case, alleging unfairness in how the United States calculates the penalty tariffs in anti-subsidy cases. 
The timing appeared to be coincidental. But an announcement earlier in the day that the United States and Japan had reached a major agreement to deploy a second advanced missile-defense radar on Japanese territory prompted immediate criticism in China.
Speaking to supporters in a state heavily dependent on the auto industry, Mr. Obama drew an explicit link between China's trade policies and the economic travails of voters in this closely contested region. By giving its exporters $1 billion in illegal subsidies from 2009 to 2011, the administration said, China is hurting American manufacturers and encouraging companies to move their production to China.
''These are subsidies that directly harm working men and women on the assembly lines in Ohio and Michigan and across the Midwest,'' Mr. Obama said at rally in a hillside park here. ''It's not right; it's against the rules, and we will not let it stand.''
After a week of anti-American violence in the Middle East that threw Mr. Romney off stride and left Mr. Obama potentially vulnerable to criticism, the focus on China put the candidates back on familiar ground, with a reliably populist theme that allowed each to try out new lines showcasing their toughness and caricaturing the fecklessness of the other.
Mr. Romney has long said he would be tougher on China than Mr. Obama. He responded on Monday to the W.T.O. action by declaring that Mr. Obama had done ''too little, too late'' to curb China's unfair trade practices. The latest case, he said, was little more than a political stunt, failing to compensate for the Obama administration's refusal to take other actions, like labeling China a currency manipulator.
''The president may think that announcing new trade lawsuits less than two months from the election will distract from his record,'' Mr. Romney said in Los Angeles. ''But American businesses and workers struggling on an uneven playing field know better.''
Mr. Obama repeated his charge that it was Mr. Romney who had sent jobs to China through his zealous practice of ''outsourcing'' at Bain Capital. Mr. Romney, he said, also profited from investments in Chinese companies. ''Ohio,'' the president declared, ''you can't stand up to China when all you've done is send them our jobs.''
The new trade case is further evidence of how Mr. Obama, after early attempts at accommodation with Beijing, has stiffened his approach to China. It was the ninth trade action that the administration has brought against China, with the highest profile ones coming this year.
The administration's timing, however, hardly appeared accidental. It was the second China trade action announced by Mr. Obama on the eve of a campaign visit to Ohio, where the auto-parts industry employs 52,400 people. Last July, just before he flew to Toledo, home of a Jeep Wrangler factory, the White House filed a complaint against Beijing for levying $3.3 billion of duties on American automobiles.
''It's not as if because we're in the midst of an election that we should wait until next year to take these steps on behalf of American workers,'' Joshua Earnest, the deputy press secretary, told reporters on Air Force One.
The United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, said his staff had been investigating China's auto subsidies for ''quite a while,'' adding in a conference call, ''We have no knowledge of the president's travel schedule.'' He said the United States would vigorously defend itself from the Chinese case on antitariff penalties.
The Obama and Romney campaigns are amplifying their remarks in tit-for-tat political advertising that focuses on China -- Mr. Romney's accusing the president of repeatedly passing up chances to get tough on Beijing; Mr. Obama's asking incredulously, ''Mitt Romney tough on China?'' and reciting the charges of outsourcing and investments in Chinese companies.
Bashing China is a tried-and-true campaign strategy for both parties, particularly in swing states like Ohio, where a heavy loss of manufacturing jobs has coincided with a surge of Chinese-made auto parts into the United States.
But for Mr. Obama it is a notable shift from 2008, when he modulated any anti-China talk, in part because jobs were not as central an issue then and in part because his foreign-policy advisers warned him that if he made China a punching bag, he would spend his first year as president repairing the damage.
Once in office, however, aides said Mr. Obama became frustrated by what he views as China's refusal to play by the rules. In the fall of 2009, he imposed a tariff on China for dumping tires into the American market. This was the most conspicuous of a stream of trade actions, covering goods from a specific category of flat-rolled steel to chicken broilers.
''We've brought more trade cases against China in one term than the previous administration did in two -- and every case we've brought that's been decided, we won,'' Mr. Obama said, noting that Mr. Romney warned that the tire case would be bad for American workers. The president claimed it created more than 1,000 jobs.
Mr. Romney is emphasizing another type of trade enforcement in which he says Mr. Obama is lacking: labeling China a currency manipulator for keeping its currency artificially undervalued. In his campaign ad, a narrator says: ''Seven times Obama could have stopped China's cheating. Seven times he refused.''
The Treasury Department has consistently declined to designate China for manipulation. Senior officials argue that to do so would only make matters worse by provoking a nationalist backlash that could lead the Chinese authorities to tighten their controls again. They note that after persistent pressure by American officials, China began relaxing the renminbi in 2010, and it has risen modestly against the dollar.
Mr. Romney, however, has declared he would label China a manipulator on his first day in office -- a threat that rattles free-trade proponents. Mr. Romney also says he would be tougher than Mr. Obama on issues like intellectual property rights.
''If I had known that all it took to get him to take action was to run an ad citing his inaction on China's cheating, I would have run one a long time ago,'' Mr. Romney said to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.

HEADLINE: U.S. Accord With Japan Over Missile Defense Draws Criticism in China

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and IAN JOHNSON; Martin Fackler and Makiko Inoue contributed reporting from Tokyo. Mia Li contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Tensions between China and the United States and its Asian allies escalated on Monday as several well-connected Chinese experts immediately criticized an announcement earlier in the day that the United States and Japan had reached a major agreement to deploy a second advanced missile-defense radar on Japanese territory.
The new conflict, coming as China and Japan have been sparring over claims to disputed islands in the sea between them, emerged as Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta arrived in Beijing from Tokyo to meet this week with China's leadership, including Xi Jinping, who is expected to become the nation's next president.
The scheduling of Mr. Panetta's meeting with Mr. Xi was made public only as the defense secretary flew to Beijing. It suggests that Mr. Xi, currently serving as China's vice president, has made a recovery from whatever ailment -- physical or political -- had kept him from making public appearances for two weeks. The absence prompted widespread speculation about whether Mr. Xi would ascend to the top post, as long planned. 
Even as the latest controversy erupted, the Chinese government began to reassert control over chaotic anti-Japanese riots that spread over the weekend to dozens of cities. But the anniversary of a 1931 incursion by Japanese troops, generally considered the opening shot in Japan's occupation of major parts of China from 1931 to 1945, revitalized the protesters angered by a territorial dispute involving islands claimed by Japan and China.
The Chinese government warned Japanese businesses to close on Tuesday, the day of the anniversary, and a number of Japanese companies, including Honda, Nissan, Canon, Panasonic and others, said they would shut their operations in China not just on Tuesday but for at least another day as well, with some saying they expected to remain closed through the end of the week. In recent days Japanese businesses have been attacked, burned and looted by protesters, companies say.
The Japanese government's response so far has been muted, with officials calling on the Chinese government to protect Japanese citizens and property.
Economically, the impact was hard to assess, but many Japanese businesses in Beijing were closed on Tuesday. The popular clothing chain Uniqlo covered its name entirely with red paper; over the weekend it had tried to protect itself by putting a sign in its windows saying it supported China's territorial claims.
On Tuesday morning, the crowds at protests in front of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing swelled into the hundreds after ebbing Monday. But they were carefully controlled by the police, who blocked off streets around the embassy.
Many Chinese people said they did not support the attacks on Japanese businesses. China's most influential blogger, Han Han, posted an essay on Monday urging Chinese not to boycott Japanese cars. He said the protests served those in power, who could use the violence to reinforce their claims that stability is paramount.
Some Chinese pleaded online with foreigners to be more nuanced in their views of China. ''Don't say 'residents of Beijing,' '' one wrote, referring to the size of the protests in a city with nearly 20 million inhabitants. ''Write 'some numbskulls in Beijing' did this or that.''
But Mr. Panetta's visit raised tensions on another front. During a stopover in Tokyo before flying to China, he praised the antimissile radar system as essential to enhancing the American-Japanese alliance and improving its ability to defend Japan from surprise attack by North Korea, while stressing that it was not aimed at China.
''The purpose of this is to enhance our ability to defend Japan,'' Mr. Panetta said at a news conference in Tokyo. ''It's also designed to help forward-deployed U.S. forces, and it also will be effective in protecting the U.S. homeland from the North Korean ballistic missile threat.''
But several leading Chinese reacted strongly, saying the system was also aimed at China, where officials fear that their relatively small nuclear deterrent could be greatly diminished by even a modest missile defense program. Two senior figures in Chinese international relations said the American missile shield was also emboldening Japan to resist China's territorial claims on the Diaoyu Islands, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan.
''The joint missile defense system objectively encourages Japan to keep an aggressive position in the Diaoyu Islands dispute, which sends China a very negative message,'' said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing. ''Japan would not have been so aggressive without the support and actions of the U.S.''
Although he has been in Asia for only two days, Mr. Panetta has been asked repeatedly about the sovereignty dispute -- and each time he responded that the United States was not taking sides in any of the region's territorial disagreements. Washington, he said, was advocating a diplomatic process to resolve the tensions peacefully, echoing points made by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on a visit to Asia this month.
Mr. Panetta's weeklong mission to Asia is intended to prove to allies and partners that the United States is refocusing its national security attention and resources on the region. At the same time, though, he has to try to convince the leadership in Beijing that the ''rebalancing'' does not have as a shadow agenda the containment of China.
Japan is already the site of one American X-band radar, officially known as the AN/TPY-2, which is a central element in a complex technical architecture for identifying ballistic missiles and coordinating a defense by interceptors. That first radar is at Shariki; the location for the second has not been decided.
The Japanese government has so far offered only a muted reaction to the Chinese protests, which were the top news over the weekend in Japan. Officials have issued appeals for restraint and called on the Chinese government to ensure the safety of Japanese individuals and businesses.
''We need to take a coolheaded approach to avoid negative impacts on overall relations,'' Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda of Japan told the broadcaster NHK. ''Japan will do so, too, but we need to strongly call on China to show restraint.''
Officials in the Noda government have said that they are considering increasing the number of coast guard ships patrolling the disputed islands, after unconfirmed reports on Chinese Web sites that as many as 1,000 Chinese fishing vessels may stage a mass protest by sailing into waters around the islands. On Monday, the coast guard said it had so far not seen any increase in the normal fishing activity around the islands.
The array of issues -- the radar, the island dispute and the American shift to Asia -- should come into clearer focus on Wednesday, when Mr. Panetta is scheduled to meet with Mr. Xi, who serves on China's Central Military Commission.
The meeting with Mr. Panetta, however, could prove tricky for Mr. Xi, 59, who is due to take over from Hu Jintao as Communist Party leader at a congress in the coming weeks. Mr. Xi, who is widely seen as more pro-American than the current leaders, has visited the United States several times, including a stay with a farming family in Iowa and an official visit to the Pentagon.
The recent protests here against Japan over the island dispute have been interpreted by some observers in Beijing as a challenge to Mr. Xi and an effort to allow Mr. Hu to stay in control of the military longer than he might have.
Mr. Hu's predecessor, Jiang Zemin, stayed on as chairman of the Central Military Commission for an extra two years when he stepped down as leader of the party and the government a decade ago. One reason given was China's unsettled external circumstances, which some hard-liners may be using now in a bid to prevent Mr. Xi from taking fuller control of the military.
''This could force Xi to take a strong line with Panetta,'' said a Chinese academic who asked not to be identified because of the issue's sensitivity. ''He will have to say very forcefully that what the U.S. is doing is wrong.''
Although the United States has said it is neutral in the dispute over the islands, its actions show it is taking sides, said Tao Wenzhao, deputy director of United States studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
''This move shows that the U.S. has picked a side between China and Japan in the Diaoyu dispute,'' Mr. Tao said. ''It is highly inappropriate and counter-constructive for the U.S. to make such a move at this highly sensitive time.''
As if to underscore its displeasure, China held a large naval exercise over the weekend, with 40 missiles launched.
In addition, China unveiled another stealth fighter, just as it disclosed another model two years ago, when Mr. Panetta's predecessor, Robert M. Gates, visited Beijing. The new model is made by a different company, and it indicates that China is pushing ahead with the project, although it is not certain if the planes will ever be produced and deployed in large numbers.

HEADLINE: Romney Responds to Release of Secret Video

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
What follows is a transcript, as recorded by The New York Times, of remarks by Mitt Romney discussing a newly released, secret video of him speaking to campaign donors. Mr. Romney addressed reporters in Costa Mesa, Calif., on Monday night:
Good evening. I understand there's been a video that's been on the Internet for a few weeks that has attracted some attention and I thought I would make some comments about it. Apparently it's got a snippet of a question and answer session at a fund-raiser event. It doesn't capture the question so I don't know precisely what was asked but I think it was about my campaign and how I would be able to get a majority of voters to support me. By the way, whoever has released the snippets would, I would certainly appreciate if they'd release the whole tape so we could see all of it. I believe the point I was made is that the president starts off with a large number of the voters, 47, 48, 49 percent, something like that. These are people who are in his camp and, uh, they will vote for him almost no matter what, and I also have a large number of people who will vote for me almost no matter what, at least I hope so, and my campaign effort is to focus on the people in the middle. The people I will try and draw into my campaign are largely people who voted for Barack Obama last time around but who I want to have as part of my campaign to become successful. 
So it's a question and answer as I recall about the process of the campaign and how I'm going to get the 51 or 52 percent I need and I point out it's by focusing on those folks that are neither in his camp nor in my camp. Of course there's a very different approach of the two different campaigns, as I point out I recognize that among those that pay no tax, approximately 47 percent of Americans, I'm not likely to be highly successful with the message of lowering taxes. That's not as attractive to those who don't pay income taxes as it is to those who do. And likewise those who are reliant on government are not as attracted to my message of slimming down the size of government. And so I then focus on those individuals who I believe are most likely to be able to be pulled into my camp and help me win the 51 or 50.1 percent that I need to become the next President.
This is, of course, something I talk about a good deal in rallies and speeches and so forth, which is the president and I have very different approaches to the future of America and what it takes to ignite our economy and put people back to work. The president believes in what I've described as a government centered society where government plays and larger and larger roll, provides for more and more of the needs of individuals and I happen to believe instead in a free enterprise, free individual society where people pursuing their dreams are able to employ one another, build enterprises, build the strongest economy in the world. I happen to believe that my approach is the approach that will put 23 million people back to work again. We've watched the results of the Presidents approach over the last three and a half, four years, and his government-centric, larger and larger government approach has meant that we have 15 million more people on food stamps, 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work or underemployed. We have had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent and my view is that the right approach for our nation is not to adopt a government centered approach, but instead a free, free people, free enterprise, free market, consumer-driven approach and that will build the strongest economy for ourselves and for the coming generation.
A question and answer session followed:
On the language he used at the Florida fund-raiser that was caught on tape, like calling 47 percent of Americans ''victims.''
Well, you said a number of things there and I'm talking about the political process of drawing people into my own campaign. Of course, individuals are going to take responsibility for their lives. My campaign is about helping people take more responsibility and becoming employed again, particularly those who don't have work. This whole campaign is focused on getting people jobs again, putting people back to work. This is ultimately a question about direction for the country. Do you believe in a government centered society that provides more and more benefits or do you believe instead in a free enterprise society where people are able to pursue their dreams....
On whether he stood by what he said during the fund-raiser and whether he offended the 47 percent of voters he referred to as ''dependents":
Well, um, it's not elegantly stated -- let me put it that way I'm speaking off the cuff in response to a question and I'm sure I can state it more clearly in a more effective way than I did in a setting like that and so I'm sure I'll point that out as time goes on. But we don't even have the question given the snippet there nor the full response and I hope the person who has the video would put out the full material. But it's a message which I'm going to carry and continue to carry which is, look, the president approach is attractive to people who aren't not paying taxes because frankly my discussion about lowering taxes isn't as attractive to them and therefore I'm not likely to draw them in to my campaign as effectively as those who are in the middle. This is really a discussion about the political process of winning the election and of course I want to help all Americans, all Americans, have a bright and prosperous future and I'm convinced the president's approach has not done that and will not do that.
On whether he says different things to his donors at fund-raisers than he does to voters on the campaign trail:
You're coming to my fund-raiser and this is the same message that I give to people which is that we have a very different approach the president and I between a government-dominated society and a society driven by free people pursuing their dreams. I'm talking about the process of campaigns, typically I don't talk about process in speeches, because I think candidates are wiser to talk about policy and their vision than to talk about how they're going to win an election. At a fund-raiser you have people say, ''Governor, how are you going to win this?'' And so I respond well, the president has his group, I have my group -- I want to keep my team strong and motivated and I want to get those people in the middle, that's something which fund-raising people who are parting with their monies are very interested in knowing: can you win or not and that's what this was addressing.
Mr. Romney walked off stage and ignored the following question from a reporter:
Governor are all of the things you said in the video things you believe? Are those core convictions?

HEADLINE: On a Challenging Day, Romney Seeks to Shift to His Policy Specifics

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and ASHLEY PARKER; Michael Barbaro, Michael D. Shear and Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
An effort by Mitt Romney to give his campaign new direction -- built around new ads intended to highlight how a Romney presidency would take the nation on a better course than President Obama -- was quickly overshadowed on Monday by the video of Mr. Romney's unscripted remarks at a fund-raiser several months ago.
The attention paid to the video -- in which he described nearly half of Americans as having a victim mentality and a dependency on government -- further complicated Mr. Romney's efforts to bring a sharper focus to his campaign and address tensions within his staff.
And a day that began with hope by his campaign that it would be back on the offensive after a couple of weeks largely spent on defense ended with a late-night news briefing where he said his comments, surreptitiously recorded and presented by the Web site of Mother Jones, were inelegantly stated. 
Earlier, Mr. Romney's aides unveiled an advertising drive intended to address a sense among undecided voters that they do not have a clear idea of where he would take the country if elected. With just seven weeks until Election Day, it was an abrupt shift from a strategy that until now had been focused almost entirely on criticizing Mr. Obama and, in particular, the president's handling of the economy.
Speaking directly into the camera in one of his commercials, Mr. Romney says, ''My plan is to help the middle class,'' and then goes on to list in broad strokes his plan to ''cut the deficit,'' ''crack down'' on China and ''champion small business.''
Many conservative leaders have been pressing Mr. Romney to be more specific about his policies, saying the campaign needs to provide a sharper contrast to Mr. Obama and set out a governing agenda. If the ad did not fill in all of the blanks in Mr. Romney's proposals, it did address what was becoming a crescendo of calls from supporters, donors and even some on Mr. Romney's own staff for what has become a new mantra, ''More Mitt.''
Aides said that recent polling done by the campaign suggested that voters were increasingly tuning in to the campaign now and were eager to hear more from Mr. Romney about his plans. In a conference call with reporters, Ed Gillespie, a senior strategist, said, ''We are not rolling out new policy so much as we are making sure people understand that when we say we can do these things, here's how we are going to get them done and these are the specifics.''
The new ad campaign, which also includes a spot criticizing Mr. Obama's economic record for average families, was intended to help put the Romney campaign back on a forward footing after a rocky two weeks following the Republican convention. But the video threatened to upend that effort.
The Romney team was hit with the disclosure of the video just hours after introducing the ads. The video showed Mr. Romney speaking candidly with donors at a fund-raising event, saying that 47 percent of voters, Mr. Obama's supporters, consider themselves ''victims,'' pay no income taxes and are therefore unresponsive to his low-tax message.
The video also showed him talking about how his best shot at winning over people who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and are now undecided is not with partisan rhetoric but with language that empathizes with their disappointment in the president's performance.
The campaign was still seeking to get beyond a public airing of internal differences that appeared Sunday in Politico, in which several campaign advisers, speaking mostly on the condition of anonymity, complained about the domineering style of Mr. Romney's chief strategist, Stuart Stevens.
In an interview with Telemundo, Mr. Romney dismissed the discussion of frustration within his campaign. ''I've got a terrific campaign,'' he said. ''My senior campaign people work extraordinarily well together. I work well with them. Our campaign is doing well.''
The Romney campaign dismissed the idea that complaints about Mr. Stevens's management style -- and exceptionally broad portfolio -- had led to an increased role for Mr. Gillespie, a former Republican Party chairman and counselor to President George W. Bush, who moved to the campaign full time several weeks ago. One aide, who would discuss campaign personnel issues only on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Gillespie was there not ''instead of'' Mr. Stevens but ''in addition to'' him, allowing him to focus more time on his most pressing responsibilities.
In interviews, several people involved in the campaign said that Mr. Gillespie was bringing a new sense of order and organization to the campaign, which was serving as an antidote to the more free-flowing style of Mr. Stevens, a longtime political advertising strategist with a creative bent, a proclivity to philosophize and no aversion to late-night phone calls or strategy sessions. (His response when aides pointed out that some of the team might be sleeping: Wake them up.)
Implicit in these descriptions of Mr. Gillespie was the notion that the campaign had been lacking the organizational approach he was bringing, though others said growing pains are natural as a campaign moves from the primaries into a general election battle, when staff grows exponentially.
The criticism against the campaign had been steadily escalating since the Republican convention, and quiet griping about Mr. Stevens was spilling outside the walls of the headquarters. Republicans said they were watching closely to see what Mr. Romney would do in the wake of the complaints that were first exposed in the Politico article.
Some Republicans close to the campaign said they hoped the concerns had reached Mr. Romney, who has come to trust Mr. Stevens's counsel even when it has conflicted with that of other friends and family.
For instance, when Mr. Romney's family and longtime friends urged him to focus more on his personal life -- including his Mormon faith -- rather than his career, Mr. Romney's response was clear and unwavering: ''I trust Stuart,'' he said, implying that they should, too.
Mr. Stevens was adamant that the campaign focus intently on the economy and his business experience. That seemed to rankle some donors.
Just a few days ago, attendees at a major fund-raiser in New York City watched a biographical video about Mr. Romney that was first played at the Republican convention, but not during prime-time network coverage.
''Why aren't they showing that video more?'' contributors asked, recalled Anthony Scaramucci, a major Romney fund-raiser.
The campaign is hoping that the latest ad with Mr. Romney discussing his vision for governing will begin allaying some of those complaints -- and, more important, quench undecided voters' thirst for more information about him.

HEADLINE: Russell E. Train, 92, Dies; Helped Create the E.P.A.

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
Russell E. Train, a renowned conservationist who played a central role in the creation of groundbreaking laws and effective enforcement in response to rising concerns about environmental protection in America, died on Monday at his farm in Bozman, Md. He was 92.
His death was announced by Carter Roberts, the president of the World Wildlife Fund, which Mr. Train helped transform into a global force for conservation.
From 1969 to 1977, as Richard M. Nixon's first chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality and then as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under Gerald R. Ford, Mr. Train was among a select group of senior administration officials and Congressional leaders who shaped the world's first comprehensive program for scrubbing the skies and waters of pollution, ensuring the survival of ecologically significant plants and animals, and safeguarding citizens from exposure to toxic chemicals.
Mr. Train was widely considered the father of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the cornerstone of all modern federal environmental legislation. Its signature provision was the look-before-you-leap requirement for federal agencies to prepare environmental impact statements before proceeding with any major project. 
Mr. Train developed the idea of establishing the Council on Environmental Quality, a policy office within the White House. He also helped persuade the Nixon administration to create the Environmental Protection Agency, empowered to execute and regulate the nation's new program of safeguarding natural resources and protecting public health.
''I felt strongly that environmental issues needed a sharp, cutting edge in government, one that had high visibility to the public,'' Mr. Train recalled in his 2003 memoir, ''Politics, Pollution, and Pandas.'' And, he wrote, ''this view finally prevailed.''
In 1978, after leaving government, Mr. Train joined the World Wildlife Fund's affiliate in the United States, first as president, then as chairman and chairman emeritus. He helped transform a small and effective conservation group into a $100 million-a-year global network of researchers and technical specialists, famed for its panda bear trademark.
Mr. Train's emergence as a central player in environmental policy, regulation and advocacy was made possible by a convergence of national need, personal passion and astute career management.
Mr. Train, a moderate Republican lawyer raised in a prominent Washington family, was 45 when he resigned midway through a successful term as a United States Tax Court judge in 1965 to become president of the Conservation Foundation. His goal was to fashion a professional career out of a decade-old desire to shelter African wildlife and natural habitat, an idea prompted by safaris he took to East Africa in 1956 and 1958.
The move coincided with the rise of the environmental movement, which was pushing to turn the ecological and public health consequences of industrialization -- pollution, exposure to toxic chemicals, clear cutting and loss of native species -- into national priorities.
Mr. Train had already gotten a taste of the rewards and the rigors of his new job. In 1961 he founded the African Wildlife Leadership Foundation, an international organization to train Africans in wildlife, habitat and national park management. He had run it out of his judicial office when he was not on the bench. That year he also became a founding board member of the World Wildlife Fund's United States affiliate.
Mr. Train had an entrepreneur's instinct for nonprofit success. For the Conservation Foundation, he recruited prominent board members, hired talented staff, built programs around novel ideas, raised money and attracted attention. His message was that the nation needed a new approach to economic growth -- that environmental values needed to be incorporated into public and private decisions about what to build and where to build it.
In one effort he joined with Ian McHarg, a professor of landscape architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, to produce ''Design With Nature,'' the seminal 1969 book on incorporating the principles of ecology into landscape construction. Mr. Train also financed the work of Lynton Keith Caldwell, a professor of political science at Indiana University, which led to the development of the federal environmental impact statement.
His Republican credentials proved crucial to Mr. Train's success. In 1968, he was chairman of a bipartisan task force on environmental issues for President-elect Nixon's transition team. In January 1969, just before the inauguration, Mr. Train sat next to Mr. Nixon at a dinner at the Pierre Hotel in New York, where the two talked about the power of environmental issues to galvanize voters.
''I emphasized that concern for the environment cut across geographic boundaries and across economic groups,'' Mr. Train wrote, ''and suggested that an environmental agenda could be a unifying political force.''
Mr. Train joined the administration as under secretary of the interior. In that post he tested the environmental impact statement process by coordinating the government's work in setting rigorous engineering and environmental protection standards for the design and construction of the 789-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline. He led the opposition to building a new Miami airport within the boundaries of Everglades National Park, and helped develop the federal Coastal Zone Management Act, which encourages states to preserve and restore wetlands, estuaries, beaches and coral reefs as well as the fish and wildlife living there.
Mr. Train was the administration's spokesman in 1969 during Congressional hearings on the proposed National Environmental Policy Act, which called for establishing the White House policy council. In 1970, after signing the law, President Nixon appointed him the council's chairman.
Mr. Train also pursued international programs that put the United States at the forefront of a global effort to protect the planet. In 1972 he led the American delegation to the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, the first large gathering of world leaders to consider environmental degradation.
A year later, at the height of the Watergate scandal, Mr. Train became administrator of the three-year-old Environmental Protection Agency, replacing William Ruckelshaus, who had been named interim director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Under Mr. Train, the E.P.A. banned four particularly toxic farm chemicals (aldrin, dieldrin, heptachlor and chlordane) and instituted auto emission limits. He recruited economists to forecast the costs of environmental rules. And he established the agency's scientific capacity to evaluate the health consequences of exposure to toxic compounds, the basis of the E.P.A.'s process for assessing the risks and benefits of its actions.
In 1991, President George Bush gave Mr. Train the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award.
Russell Errol Train was born in Jamestown, R.I., on June 4, 1920, and raised in Washington, the youngest of three boys of Rear Adm. Charles Russell Train and the former Errol Cuthbert. His paternal great-grandfather had been a congressman during the Civil War. An ancestor, John Trayne, had emigrated from Scotland to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635.
Mr. Train went to the Potomac School and then St. Albans (learning to hunt on family vacations in the Adirondacks). He graduated from Princeton in 1941 and Columbia University Law School in 1948.
A man of exquisite manners, he was trained in the ways of Washington from an early age. His father had an office at the White House, where he served as President Herbert Hoover's Naval aide. In 1932, Mrs. Hoover invited Mr. Train and his older brothers, Cuthbert and Middleton, to spend the night at the White House, where they slept in the Andrew Jackson bedroom and breakfasted with the president and Mrs. Hoover on the portico overlooking the Ellipse and the Washington Monument.
''I think what made the greatest impression on me,'' he wrote years later, ''were the tall glasses of fresh California orange juice. I had never seen anything like those large glassfuls before.''
Mr. Train is survived by his wife of 58 years, Aileen; three daughters, Nancy Smith, Emily Rowan and Errol Giordano; a son, Charles Bowdoin Train; and 12 grandchildren.
Mr. Roberts, the World Wildlife Fund's president, said Mr. Train became chairman emeritus of the group 12 years ago.
''He came into our headquarters every week,'' Mr. Roberts said in an e-mail. ''He prowled the hallways in a pinstripe or a seersucker suit, always with a handkerchief jutting out of the pocket, and poking our staff to get more done quickly. You could always rely on Russ to be practical and unconventional at the same time. Even in the last five years, he was always a voice as an ex-E.P.A. administrator in defending the role of the E.P.A.''

HEADLINE: In Video Clip, Romney Calls 47% 'Dependent' and Feeling Entitled

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
12:26 a.m., Sept. 18 | Updated
WASHINGTON - During a private reception with wealthy donors this year,Mitt Romney described almost half of Americans as "people who pay no income tax" and are "dependent upon government." Those voters, he said, would probably support President Obama because they believe they are "victims" who are "entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it."
In a brief and hastily called news conference Monday just after 10 p.m., Mr. Romney acknowledged having made the blunt political and cultural assessment, saying it was "not elegantly stated," but he stood by the substance of the remarks, insisting that he had made similar observations in public without generating controversy.
The video of Mr. Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, was made in May, offering a rare glimpse of his personal views. Mr. Romney told reporters that he had been "speaking off the cuff in response to a question" at the fund-raiser, and said he wanted "to help all Americans - all Americans - have a bright, prosperous future." 
Democrats quickly condemned the remarks as insensitive, and Mr. Obama's campaign accused Mr. Romney of having "disdainfully written off half the nation."
The video surfaced as the campaign enters its final 50 days and as Mr. Romney sought to restart his campaign with new ads and new messaging, in response to calls in his campaign and from outside for him to be more specific about how his policies would fix the nation's economy and help the middle class.
Now, the video has raised the possibility that Mr. Romney's campaign will be sidetracked, with attention focused again on his proposed tax cuts for the wealthy, the release of his personal tax returns and his ability to connect with middle-class voters. With its unvarnished language, the video seems to undermine what aides have argued is an enduring attribute that would appeal to independent voters: a sense that Mr. Romney is, at base, an empathetic and caring man.
Snippets of the video of Mr. Romney were posted online Monday afternoon by Mother Jones, a liberal magazine, which said it had obtained the recording and had confirmed its authenticity. The magazine said it was concealing the identity of the person who had recorded the video and the location and time of the recording.
The author of the Mother Jones article, David Corn, said on MSNBC that the video was shot on May 17 at the Boca Raton, Fla., home of Marc Leder, a financier, who held a $50,000-a-person fund-raiser for Mr. Romney that night.
In one clip, Mr. Romney describes how his campaign would not try to appeal to "47 percent of the people" who will vote for Mr. Obama "no matter what." They are, he says, "dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them."
He says those people "pay no income tax," and "so our message of low taxes doesn't connect." Mr. Romney adds: "My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."
The comments were much more stark than Mr. Romney's usual remarks, though he typically talks in public about supporters of Mr. Obama's wanting big government to take care of their problems. He often accuses Mr. Obama and his supporters of wanting to bring a European-style socialism to the United States. In the video clips, Mr. Romney says his campaign is concentrating on the "5 to 10 percent in the center" whom he described as "thoughtful" voters.
Mr. Romney addressed the video, somewhat awkwardly, at a fund-raiser Monday night in Costa Mesa, Calif., summoning reporters with a few moments' notice to walk through the Segerstrom Center for the Arts, which was filled with guests sipping drinks at tables elegantly draped in blue cloths.
Mr. Romney said his comments addressed "a question about direction for the country: Do you believe in a government-centered society that provides more and more benefits? Or do you believe instead in a free-enterprise society where people are able to pursue their dreams?"
Asked whether he delivers different, starker messages to wealthy donors than he does to ordinary voters at campaign rallies, Mr. Romney said he was offering the same message, though he has never used the language in the video at a public event.
But Mr. Romney acknowledged that he wanted to offer donors a candid sense of his strategy, given the role they play in his campaign. "That's something which fund-raising people who are parting with their monies are very interested in - knowing can you win or not and that's what this was addressing," he said.
Mr. Romney, who has been under fire for releasing only two years of his tax returns, was quickly attacked by the Obama campaign. Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, said in a statement Monday evening that it was "shocking" that Mr. Romney would "go behind closed doors" to describe nearly half of the country in such terms.
Late Monday night, Mr. Messina sent out a fund-raising appeal to Mr. Obama's supporters, saying that someone "who demonstrates such disgust and disdain for half of our fellow Americans" does not deserve to be president.
Mr. Romney is not the first presidential candidate to be caught speaking candidly at a fund-raiser. Four years ago during the Democratic primary campaign, The Huffington Post published Mr. Obama's remarks at a San Francisco fund-raiser, saying small-town Pennsylvania voters, bitter over their economic circumstances, "cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them" as a way to explain their frustrations.
The Romney video was unearthed apparently with help from James Carter, a grandson of former PresidentJimmy Carter. Mr. Carter, who lists "oppo researcher" on his Twitter bio, told New York Magazine that he had helped find the videos and get them to Mr. Corn. He is credited with "research assistance" on the Mother Jones Web site. Mr. Romney has repeatedly compared Mr. Obama to President Carter, suggesting both were failures.
In an audio clip posted online from the same fund-raiser, apparently by the person who gave the videos to Mother Jones, Mr. Romney is heard joking that he would have an easier time winning the election if his father had been born to Mexican parents.
"My dad, as you probably know, was the governor of Michigan and was the head of a car company," Mr. Romney says in the audio clip. "But he was born in Mexico, and, uh, had he been born of, uh, Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot at winning this."
But the most striking part of the video is Mr. Romney's characterization of nearly half of the country. His assessment of the "47 percent" echoes a line of conservative thinking that is championed by his running mate, RepresentativePaul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. Mr. Ryan has long argued that nearly half of the people in America are either "dependent" or "reliant" on the federal government.
Mr. Romney's figure of 47 percent comes from the Tax Policy Center, which found that 46.4 percent of households paid no federal income tax in 2011.
But most households did pay payroll taxes. Of the 18.1 percent of households that paid neither income taxes nor payroll taxes, the center found that more than half were elderly and more than a third were not elderly but had income under $20,000. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the center, wrote in a blog post last summer that about half of those were off the rolls because they had low incomes.

HEADLINE: Trade Case May Produce Few Results

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; John H. Cushman Jr. and Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- President Obama's trade case against China on cars and auto parts will have little immediate impact on jobs and companies in the United States, but it is one of the few legal options available to the United States as China's auto industry faces overcapacity problems and looks overseas to increase sales.
In filing the case on Monday with the World Trade Organization, Mr. Obama is making a political gesture to Midwestern states coping with the pressure that Chinese exports are placing on the American auto industry. But actual effects are likely to be delayed and limited. 
World Trade Organization cases typically take a year and a half to resolve. And unlike antidumping and antisubsidy cases, which can result in steep tariffs on imports that stay in place for years, the trade organization cases often end with the losing country simply abandoning the offending policy.
There can be a requirement that companies repay previous subsidies, but that is often difficult to enforce and can require further years of legal wrangling.
The subsidies at issue are also small relative to the scale of Chinese exports, which may mean that China's low wages, high investment rate and other advantages may have played a bigger role in the spectacular expansion of Chinese auto exports than government subsidies.
American trade officials respond that while China may have many strengths underlying its export prowess, they are doing what they can to address those policies that may violate international trade rules -- particularly China's emerging policy of setting up so-called export bases in which automakers receive incentives to make cars and car parts for overseas markets.
''The Obama administration will use every available avenue to stand up for American workers and businesses in the global trading system, and in taking this case to the W.T.O. against China we're doing so in a way that tackles China's entire export bases program in this sector,'' said Carol Guthrie, the spokeswoman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative.
She added, ''This administration has a consistent record of supporting American jobs through wins at the W.T.O., smart use of all our enforcement options and dialogue that gets results for American workers as well.''
The Chinese export bases policies are so numerous, and affect so many different kinds of products, that it would take dozens of separate antisubsidy cases to tackle all of them. That would require a far lengthier legal effort than a single trade organization case, which the United States has started by essentially filing a list of the names of the offending policies to China.
Under the process, the United States essentially demands that Chinese officials start discussing how, if at all, the many policies are consistent with China's commitment as a World Trade Organization member not to subsidize exports.
Another advantage of such cases is that they require the United States only to prove that the Chinese policies violate organization rules. Antisubsidy cases at the Commerce Department also require proof that a domestic industry has suffered financial injury as a direct result of the foreign subsidies. That tends to be harder to prove when the industry's health is improving, and auto sales are rising this year as Americans replace aging cars.
The Obama administration said the subsidies to exporters in China totaled at least $1 billion from 2009 through 2011. But Chinese customs data shows that the country exported $56 billion worth of automotive equipment during these years.
Obama administration officials say that something needs to be done about Chinese subsidies, and the automotive subsidy case is a start. As China has lost previous W.T.O. cases, subsidies have increasingly been hidden in local and provincial budgets, and it is these that Monday's case pursued.
The filing lists more than 80 specific policies, often at the municipal level, that are part of China's export bases program. W.T.O. rules explicitly ban countries from providing subsidies that are contingent on goods being exported.
Finding offending policies at the municipal and provincial level has long been a challenge for governments filing W.T.O. cases worldwide, because of language barriers and because many rules are not published. The Obama administration persuaded Congress early this year to authorize more money for trade enforcement staff, and it said on Monday that the export subsidy case was one result of this.
The global trading system has long been founded in part on the assumption that companies will act to defend operations in their home countries, and will file antidumping and antisubsidy cases against imports. But that logic has eroded in recent years in the case of China as practically every Western multinational corporation -- as well as a growing number of small and medium-size companies -- has moved factories and other operations to China and become reluctant to risk retaliation by filing trade cases.
When the Obama administration took office, it sought economic cooperation with China on many issues while bringing a series of trade cases on mostly industries that were either small or politically less prominent. The conspicuous exception was a decision in September 2009 to impose tariffs on tires imported from China, and even that decision was to some extent forced by complex legal deadlines in the United States.
The administration chose not to take a broad action on Chinese solar panels after it was asked to do so in a legal filing by the United Steelworkers in September 2010. That left imports essentially unrestricted as a series of solar panel manufacturers in the United States then went bankrupt or cut production and laid off workers in the following year.
What is left of the American solar panel manufacturing industry has only begun to stabilize after a German company with sizable operations in the United States and essentially none in China, SolarWorld, filed antidumping and antisubsidy cases late last year, resulting in the imposition in the spring of combined tariffs totaling more than 33 percent.
A W.T.O. case does have one big advantage over antidumping and antisubsidy cases: the filing can take aim at policies that are distorting trade all over the world, helping American companies export to other countries. By contrast, antidumping and antisubsidy cases protect only a country's home market.
Chinese automakers have been rapidly expanding their shares of markets in emerging markets in South America, for example, traditionally an area of strength for Detroit manufacturers. The W.T.O. case is aimed at all Chinese automotive subsidies regardless of whether the exports are going to the United States.
The value of such complaints to W.T.O. dispute resolution, instead of domestic trade remedies like antidumping, ''is that if the subsidies are withdrawn, it can improve the competitive position of U.S. exporters in other markets,'' said Carolyn B. Gleason, a partner and longtime trade lawyer in the Washington office of McDermott Will & Emery.

HEADLINE: A Business Owner Expects the Worst From Health Insurance Overhaul

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Ultimately, Kurt Summers says, the reaction of many small-business owners to the health care overhaul comes down to fear: "I'm sitting at my desk with payroll and expenses wondering, 'What are my customers thinking?'" 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court decision upholding most of the Affordable Care Act came as a blow to Kurt Summers, a small-business owner in Austin, Tex. Soon after the decision was announced, he warned his fellow citizens, through the auspices of The Washington Post, that unless "we elect officials to both Congress and the White House who understand the importance of small business and who will return some sanity to Washington" - and repeal the health law - he will most likely have to postpone his considerable ambitions for his company.
In the short-term, today's ruling will force me to pause and rethink my immediate hiring, acquisition and expansion plans. In order to plan ahead, I need to know what future costs and regulations I will be facing. With the law intact, I expect the cost of doing business to increase and new regulations to be delivered by a federal government that doesn't appreciate the daily challenges of running a business.
Like many small companies, our business is largely dependent on the prosperity of larger business; if the economy begins to fail, and if our business customers suffer as a result of this law, the ripple effect will force us to hunker down and perhaps even to let people go.
In our first two profiles of business owners struggling with health care decisions, those owners did not have such strong feelings about the Affordable Care Act - they had hoped they would benefit from it, but they didn't know much about it. Mr. Summers, our third profile, is obviously in a different situation, and we wanted to understand why.
Mr. Summers is a board member for the National Federation of Independent Business, which brought the lawsuit that the Supreme Court decided. He said he originally wrote his article at the behest of the group, which placed it at The Washington Post. Because the N.F.I.B. wanted to distribute its views the moment the Supreme Court spoke, Mr. Summers also prepared reactions to be published in the event of a split verdict or a decision to strike down the whole law.
As it happens, Mr. Summers owns two businesses. Austin Generator Service, a business that his father started in 1978, sells and maintains back-up generators to institutions like hospitals, government offices and high-rise residential buildings. Several years ago, Mr. Summers opened a side business that rents equipment for testing generators and other power equipment. It is called Loadbanks of America, and it has since become his engine of growth. Together the two companies employ 24 people, he said, up from 14 or 15 in 2008. So far this year, he has hired six new people, with plans to hire at least five more next year.
Mr. Summers offers his employees two insurance plans. Most of them subscribe to a major medical policy with a $3,000 deductible. "When you make the deductible, it's a hundred percent paid up to - I guess there's no limit on it now under the new health care law," he said, alluding to a provision, frequently mentioned by Democrats, that eliminates lifetime caps on benefits. (Annual limits on benefits are banned beginning 2014.) There are, however, co-payments for prescription drugs and doctor visits. The insurance is through United Healthcare, and Mr. Summers said he was satisfied with the choice of doctors. This year, Mr. Summers added a similar plan, but with a $4,000 deductible and a health savings account. He does not offer family coverage.
Whatever its limitations, the insurance Mr. Summers provides has gotten more expensive every year. The company currently pays about 90 percent of the premium cost, and "we've increased that contribution every year to cover most of the cost increases that we've seen over the last three years," he said. This year the company is paying about $3,360 per employee. Still, that would make this a relatively inexpensive plan, to judge by the most recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey of employer-sponsored health care, which reports that the average high-deductible plan in the South cost $4,862 in 2012.
But at one point Mr. Summers and his father actually dropped health insurance, because "the premiums exceeded our profits." Five or six years ago, about the time he got into the load bank business, Mr. Summers concluded that he needed to cover himself and his employees, not only to protect the company should he need medical care but also to lure the talent needed to expand.
And he has big plans for the load bank business. His two companies have already outgrown a 5,000-square-foot storage building bought in 2010; in three years, he'd like to build a 20,000-square-foot facility. He would also like to establish branch offices and supply depots in four to six major cities around the country and hire people to staff them. "Assuming the economy doesn't tank, and we don't put the brakes on, we do anticipate being in the 50- to 100-employee range in the next three to five years," he said. The total investment over five years, in land, people, and inventory could range from $5 million to $10 million.
In his commentary, Mr. Summers wrote that he expected "the cost of doing business to increase," but in conversation he was reluctant to be pinned down on the new costs he'd face. He said his insurance agent had told him that the consumer protections in the law - such as removing those caps on reimbursed medical expenses - were at least partly responsible for his higher insurance premiums. ("You cannot provide free services and not pay for it," he said.) But he also acknowledged that it was difficult to gauge the law's direct effects on his business two years before its main provisions would take effect.
Mr. Summers was more comfortable discussing the health care law's implications for the broader economy than the direct effect on his own business. We talked at length about why he fears his customers could retrench in the wake of the law's execution - and how his suppliers might pass on their increased costs to him, raising his costs as his revenue is squeezed. But it turns out that in a long conversation, Mr. Summers's thinking about the law and its effects is a bit more nuanced. He deployed many ifs and coulds. When pressed to explain why he presumed business - that of his customers and his suppliers - would react so negatively to the health care law, he tempered his pessimism.
"I hope I'm not saying that I'm presuming that is going to happen," he said. "I think it could happen, and by nature of that possibility, I simply have to be cautious." Mr. Summers also said that he would be closely monitoring the economy and customer demand irrespective of the health care law's fate, and he would adjust his plans as circumstances warranted.
The Agenda suggested that his customers and suppliers were unlikely to be any better than he at predicting how the law might affect their companies. He conceded this, and a few minutes later offered an explanation for what seems to be a pervasive sense of gloom in the small-business economy.
"When you talk about an economy that's sluggish," he said, "you're really talking about people keeping their money, people not spending their dollars. And it's been proven over and over again that the reason people don't spend their dollars is an emotional decision - it's fear.
"We could look at this very practically and with statistics and facts, but even if we could prove that the impact of the law was minimal, the emotion of the impact is still there. And what's fueling that emotion? Well, maybe it's misinformation, but maybe it's also just plain and simple uncertainty. Maybe it's the reality that I'm sitting at my desk with payroll and expenses wondering, 'What are my customers thinking?'"
The elements of the law intended to help small businesses did not impress Mr. Summers. The wages he pays are too high to qualify for the small-business health tax credit. His firm did receive a small rebate on its insurance premiums made possible by the law, but Mr. Summers dismissed the check as "something stupid" -- less than $200.
"It just created another administrative task for my people," he said. "It was ridiculous."
 As always, we'd like to hear from you. If you have an interesting story to tell about how you provide health care for your employees, please drop us a line.

HIGHLIGHT: Here's another roundup of setbacks and slips in our continuing struggle to make verbs agree with their subjects and pronouns with their antecedents. 

 BODY:
Here's another roundup of setbacks and slips in our continuing struggle to make verbs agree with their subjects and pronouns with their antecedents.
Sometimes it's trickier than it seems. But still ...
 The sprawling air base, in the Attock district of Punjab, is believed by some Western experts to be one of the locations where elements of Pakistan's nuclear stockpile, estimated to include at least 100 warheads, is stored. 
As often happens, the phrase in between the subject and verb threw us off track. Make it "elements ... are stored."
 NAIROBI, Kenya - China's investment prowess and construction know-how is widely on display in this long-congested African capital. 
A compound subject like this is plural and should take a plural verb. We frequently go astray when, as here, the nouns in the subject are abstract. Make it "investment prowess and construction know-how are on display."
 Of course, nowhere is the hysteria and anticipation more frenzied than at Alabama and L.S.U., the teams that played for last year's national championship. 
The same problem here, with a compound subject containing abstract nouns; the inverted structure may have contributed to the confusion. Make it "nowhere are the hysteria and anticipation ..."
 Like their opponents in Boston, Obama's team prides itself on being grounded in "objective" campaign realities rather than the "virtual" ones spat forth by the news cycle. 
The plural "their" has no plural noun for its antecedent; "team" is singular, as the singular "prides" and "itself" make clear. In this case, it's probably best to make the whole thing plural, e.g. "Like their opponents in Boston, members of Obama's team pride themselves ..."
 At Marea, Michael White's Italian restaurant on Central Park South, for instance, the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman is a regular and one of many customers who rates an NR, never refuse. 
No diatribe about subject/verb agreement would be complete without an example of this problem. Remember, in this construction, the relative clause describes the group of people with something in common, not just the one person who is a member of that group. Or, in grammatical terms, the antecedent of the relative pronoun "who" is the plural "customers," not the singular "one." So make it "one of many customers who rate ..."
 After the economic downturn forced them to close Four Rivers, their high-end Thai spot in Fort Lauderdale, they came north -- not to open another Thai restaurant, but to help run the kitchen of one of those charming Maine inns that serves lobster and chowder. 
Same problem. The relative clause describes not just their specific inn, but all those charming Maine inns that have something in common -- they serve lobster and chowder.
 The state's ethics commission met in secret on Tuesday to discuss how and whether to proceed in their investigation of the Assembly's handling of the matter, including Mr. Silver's decision to authorize a monetary settlement to two members of Mr. Lopez's staff who alleged that they had been harassed by him. 
"Commission" is singular; the pronoun should be "its."
 Slapdashes 
Loose use of dashes can lead to trouble. A couple of recent examples:
 The list of global banks that have been accused in recent years of laundering foreign transactions totaling billions of dollars has been growing - Credit Suisse, Lloyds, Barclays, ING, HSBC - and now Standard Chartered. 
There should be just one dash, before "Credit Suisse," not two. Dashes set off parenthetical material that could be removed while leaving the rest of the sentence intact. Here, if we remove just what's between the dashes, the final phrase "and now Standard Chartered" doesn't fit the sentence.
 At a time when powerful career women are showcased at each convention - former secretaries of state, senators, governors, activists - the role of the president's wife - or an aspiring president's wife - seems pretty much frozen in the template set by Jacqueline Kennedy and Pat Nixon. 
Using more than one pair of dashes in a sentence creates confusion and should be avoided. In this case the problem was fixed for later editions by using commas in place of the second pair of dashes.
 In a Word 
This week's grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.
 The apartment's windows, covered with metal grating, are about a foot-and-a-half above the sidewalk. 
No hyphens needed here.
 Twelve days later, she was found strangled to death. 
Redundant. This is the equivalent of saying "killed to death."
 The Stanford researchers said that by providing an objective review of the current science of organic foods, their goal was to allow people to make informed choices. 
A dangler: "their goal" isn't providing an objective view, the researchers are.
 Although Mr. Annan got both sides to commit verbally to a cease-fire in March, there was never even the semblance of one. 
If we meant via spoken word here, we meant "orally."
 [Editorial] And he clearly laid out a vision for governing squarely at odds with the one that Mr. Romney has, but was hidden from view at last week's Republican convention in Tampa, Fla. 
We should have repeated "that" before "was hidden." "That" functions as the object of "has," but as the subject of "was hidden." The same word can't switch case like that, so we need to supply another "that" for the second clause.
 When Mr. Francescon arrived, he put the kibosh on the plan. To him, the bedrooms were shockingly small. 
This somewhat dated slang didn't add anything.
 Madame President 
 [Caption] "The American Presidential Experience,'' a traveling exhibit, has landed in Charlotte, N.C., to coincide with the Democratic National Convention. Above, Jyoti Vashee taking a photograph of her children, Shivali, 13, and Rushil, 9, at the exhibit's mock Oval Office. 
Make it "Madam" President.
 He noted that Mrs. Clinton had stopped raising money, making endorsements or, for the most part, inveighing on political debates. "She's had to miss everything on that front ever since January 2009." 
"Inveigh" means to make a verbal attack. Did we mean "weighing in"? 
 [Column] Both women spoke winningly, but Mrs. Obama, who has addressed a political convention before, gave the strongest performance. 
Make it "stronger," since there were only two performances.
 Fifteen states and the District of Columbia now prohibit teenagers from driving with another teenager, and all but seven states forbid them from driving with more than one. 
Say "forbid them to drive" rather than "forbid them from driving." 
 The implications extend beyond Florida. Elderly voters are significant forces in Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio and Virginia and Pennsylvania, all states that could help determine the outcome of the election. 
We used an extra "and" when a comma would have been correct for the series.
 Representative Kathy Hochul of Erie County is meeting with small business owners. 
It's in the stylebook: small-business owners.

HEADLINE: XOXO: A Festival of Indie Internet Creativity

BYLINE: JENNA WORTHAM and DAVID F. GALLAGHER


HIGHLIGHT: The XOXO Festival in Portland, Ore., over the weekend brought 400 people together to discuss the many ways that the Internet is helping to "creatively disrupt" traditional businesses and industries. Here are a few of the highlights. 

 BODY:
It's easy to forget, sometimes, that behind all the screens, behind all the slide shows of funny animal photos and GIFs, the Internet is made of people. 
These are people who are making things and figuring out new ways to turn their work on the Web into a business - and not necessarily by creating social advertising. Instead, they are coming up with ideas to develop, finance and market projects like films, albums, products and companies that might typically get rejected by movie studios, record labels and venture capitalists. 
That was one of the main themes of a four-day conference in Portland, Ore., the XOXO Festival, that brought about 400 people together over the weekend to discuss the many ways that the Internet is helping to "creatively disrupt" traditional businesses and industries.
The weekend was infused with the vibe of creative makery. In addition to a weekend full of talks, the first floor of the arts center that hosted the conference was turned into an artsy fringe festival/marketplace. Attendees could browse custom smartphone cases, play with 3D printers, try indie games, peruse zines and visit a booth of popular Kickstarter projects. Food trucks serving local fare filled the street outside of the event, including a cart selling handmade ice cream. (A truck was there giving free screen printing lessons.)
All of it was meant to emphasize a new economy that is being reshaped. It defies tradition and prizes creativity, seeks direct contact with customers and an audience, and formalizes that process and scales it, so that instead of asking your relatives to finance your next film, people can make use of the network effect and generate support, social and financial, from a large network of people online.
Yancey Strickler, one of the founders of Kickstarter, which was used to sell tickets for the conference, described in an interview a new economy, one "that is being created by the minute." But what does that new economy look like and how will it work? 
Here are impressionistic insights and tidbits from some of the speakers who took the stage at XOXO.
 Dan Provost and Tom Gerhardt of Studio Neat have created successful Kickstarter projects including the Glyf photo accessory for the iPhone and the Cosmonaut stylus for the iPad. They promoted the benefits of staying local, by having hardware products made in the United States. "This is Joel," Mr. Gerhardt said, showing a photo of an engineer at the factory where Studio Neat products are made. "We have his cellphone number." Mr. Provost said that in their experience, "people love to know where things come from, how they're made and who is making them." 
 Jamie Wilkinson is one of the founders of VHX.tv, a video site that lets artists sell their work directly to fans, including the latest comedy special from Aziz Ansari. He used his talk to dispel myths that keep creative types and entrepreneurs from releasing professional content through the Web. "Establish a brand on the Web and use that to promote work," he said. 
Mr. Wilkinson gave the example of "Indie Game: The Movie," a documentary about game makers, which was promoted and distributed both on iTunes and on VHX.tv. The film attracted the same amount of sales on both sites. 
"Self-distribution works, and you can make enough to get by on," he said. 
 Christopher Poole, the founder of the notorious message board 4chan, and its more legitimate sibling, the venture-backed image-remixing site Canvas, talked about the perks of running a site that isn't necessarily financially viable. He said that 4chan, which gets tens of millions of page views, has been losing money for the last year. Despite that, he said, "I'd take that over a million dollars any day," because he is doing something that he loves.
 Ron Carmel of the independent game studio 2D Boy, creator of the hit game World of Goo, said that he and his team initially thought they needed a publisher for the game, then started asking whether they should try to sell it themselves. They sold downloads on the Web and through the Nintendo Wii, then added versions for more platforms, including Apple's mobile devices. When asked how the game had done, Mr. Carmel said, "It's very successful. I'm not fully retired, but I don't need to work for the next 10 or 20 years." That brought a round of applause. 
Many speakers talked about the challenges of being a smaller business and having rivals duplicate their efforts. 
 Bre Pettis, chief executive of MakerBot, which makes 3-D printers, talked about a project his company did with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York that involved taking photos of artworks from many angles, then using them to create a digital 3-D blueprint and a printed replica. He said that he had been tempted to do this on the sly: "I was ready to steal it all, and they said, no, no, come on in!" 
Mr. Pettis expressed frustration with companies that clone his product - though he acknowledged that MakerBot is in a difficult position because it tries to share as much information as it can about the workings of its printers. "Carbon-copy clones make spending money on product innovation challenging," he said. One company in China called Mbot, is "basically taking Makerbots and selling them for cheaper," he said, adding: "That is one of the things I have to think about - how to keep innovating while still sharing." 
Patents are also a worry, because the company's products are competing with more elaborate devices from larger companies, so it has had to navigate around "a couple thousand patents," he said. "I kind of assumed when we started that the patent system would have failed by the time we got big enough to care about that," Mr. Pettis said to laughter from the crowd. 
 Dan Harmon, the creator of Community, a comedy series on NBC, set the tone of the event with a raucous keynote speech on Saturday night that urged attendees to seek out creativity above all else. In his experience, the entertainment industry was spoiled by the influx of money and metrics, rather than valuing the creation of quality content. He warned those in attendance of worrying too much about generating a profit. "Don't value the connection more than the things it's connected to," he said.
There were few complaints about the otherwise thoughtfully organized festival, which included parties and events at local companies. The Wi-Fi didn't go down once! As the conference wrapped up, Andy Baio and Andy McMillan, the organizers, gave a teary thanks to the audience, and suggested that the conference, a one-off experiment, would return in some form next year.
One lingering critique that pushed its way into conversation a few times over the course of the weekend, especially after a few pints of locally crafted beers, was one of access. Now that a new economy, a new playbook for making interesting content and projects, is beginning to form, how can we ensure that everyone, not just people with the know-how and social ties to help support it, benefit from it?

HEADLINE: Who Pays and Who Takes

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Almost no families fail to pay taxes of any kind, and about half the population lives in a household where at least one member receives a government benefit. 

 BODY:
Comments made by Mitt Romney at a private campaign fund-raiser about the nearly half of Americans who have no income tax liability have heated up a debate over who pays and who takes from the federal government.
Budget experts argue that virtually all Americans - rich and poor - pay into the government revenue system. And most Americans - rich and poor - at some point in their lives receive a form of government benefit.
Only about 8 percent of American households do not pay income or federal payroll taxes, once you discount older people. Most of those households are very poor, earning less than $20,000 a year, according to a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which initially derived the 47 percent number Mr. Romney cited. (In 2011, it was actually 46 percent.)
Moreover, almost no families fail to pay taxes of any kind, given the ubiquity of property taxes, sales taxes, sin taxes, state and local levies and other government revenue sources.
A report by the Hamilton Project, a research group within the Brookings Institution, also notes that demographics matter when talking about who pays taxes. In any given year, millions of households will not be liable for federal income taxes. But many of those households are young or old - students or retirees. During their prime working years, the people in those households will almost certainly pay federal income taxes. 
Moreover, among those families in their prime working years, many will see their federal income tax liability wiped out by credits for children and child care, including the earned-income tax credit. But once those children grow up, or the family's income rises, the tax liability reliably returns.
Finally, the report notes that the recession has skewed these figures. There are about 12.5 million Americans out of work, and millions more who are underemployed or who have dropped out of the labor force. Reductions in income make it easier for the credits and subsidies in the tax code to erase a given family's income tax liability.
Then, there's the flip side of the coin: If we're all paying in, who is getting the payout?
Census data shows that about half of the population lives in a household where at least one member is receiving a government benefit. Many households receive more than one.
As of the second quarter of 2011, 34 million households were receiving Medicare, 38 million Social Security, 15 million food stamps and 23 million Medicaid, for instance.
There are a variety of reasons. The number of Americans relying on the safety net surged during the recession and the sluggish recovery. Unemployment for many and stagnant wages for many more translate into increased need. A person's age matters as well. Older people tend to draw government benefits like Medicare and Social Security. Increasingly, as my colleagues Binyamin Appelbaum and Robert Gebeloff wrote this year, those benefits go to the middle class, not the poor.

HEADLINE: Getting Bluefin Tuna Off the Hook

BYLINE: KELLY SLIVKA


HIGHLIGHT: Researchers are seeking to replace longlines for catching swordfish and yellowfin tuna with gear that results in a smaller incidental catch of Atlantic bluefin tuna. 

 BODY:
The longline fishery is aptly named. Fishermen will unroll a surface longline into the ocean that can extend for 40 miles and is segmented with baited hooks and buoys. They'll let it float for a number of hours, hooking whatever swims along that has a taste for the bait. 
Then the hooks are emptied of their catch as the line is rewound onto a big spool on the back of the fishing boat. Anything the fishermen want to sell is kept onboard, and anything caught incidentally, known as bycatch, is typically thrown over, dead or alive. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, many fishermen use longlines to fish for swordfish and yellowfin tuna, but they also end up catching Atlantic bluefin tuna, among other species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the Atlantic bluefin as a threatened species and the Gulf of Mexico is known to be one of its spawning grounds, so purposefully fishing for the species has been forbidden in the gulf since 1982. 
However, the fishermen are allowed to catch some bluefins while fishing for other species -- a loophole that the Pew Environment Group would like to close, said Tom Wheatley, who manages the organization's Gulf Surface Longline Campaign.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has already taken action to protect bluefin, not just by closing the gulf's bluefin fishery in the 1980's but by requiring weak hooks on longlines that should give way when an animal as strong as a bluefin pulls on it, said Monica Allen, a spokesperson for NOAA fisheries. 
Yet Pew and other groups want to see protections for bluefin tuna strengthened, and they are hoping they can help that happen as NOAA drafts a final rule expected in the fall of 2013 to more effectively protect highly migratory Atlantic species. So Pew has helped to find funding for research by David Kerstetter, a fisheries scientist with Nova Southeastern University in Florida. Dr. Kerstetter, who serves on NOAA's advisory panel on highly migratory species, is collaborating on a pilot project with gulf swordfish and yellowfin tuna fishermen that involves testing two alternative fishing methods that tend to have a far smaller bluefin bycatch. 
Dr. Kerstetter began monitoring fishermen using these alternatives, known as swordfish buoy gear and green stick gear, in May. He'll keep track of their catch and bycatch, calculate the methods' comparative economy and try to gain perspective on the overall feasibility of replacing longlines with these gear types.
Mr. Wheatley described the pilot project as exciting. "We just don't have scientists and fishermen working together enough," he said. When fishermen are involved in testing the gear, he explained, the test catches will more accurately reflect reality, and the fishermen will be more likely to buy into policy changes when they are drafted further down the line.
Dr. Kerstetter has been doing this sort of collaborative fishing gear research in the Atlantic for 15 years. With research funds from NOAA, he began testing swordfish buoy gear in 2006 and was surprised by how well the gear targeted only the properly sized swordfish that the fishermen were hoping to catch: "The bycatch is amazingly low," he said, although he adds that he's still not exactly sure why the buoy gear works so much better than longlines.
One theory, Dr. Kerstetter said, is that fishermen must closely monitor the alternative gear types. "The gear is tended, so any fish that you do catch is quickly seen and brought into the boat for sale or quickly released" alive, he said.
Swordfish buoy gear was invented by fishermen on the East Coast about a decade ago during closures of the longline swordfish fishery, Mr. Wheatley said. The green stick gear, invented by the Japanese, was brought to Hawaii, where a couple of vacationing fishermen from Wanchese, N.C., saw it in use and decided to give it a try back home. 
"People have been using green stick gear in Wanchese for over 20 years now," Dr. Kerstetter said. He said it was generally cheaper than longlines because it has only 7 to 12 baited hooks that hang down from a mainline. Longlines require about 2,200 hooks per trip, he said.
Of course, fewer hooks translates into fewer fish on the line. Mr. Wheatley suggested that if more fishermen joined the fleet, they could collectively catch as many fish with the new gear types as they do with longlines. "This could be a job creation program as well," he said.
Mr. Wheatley sees it as an optimal moment for a shift from longlines to new gear types. Not only is a change in policy on highly migratory species in the making, but money will be flowing toward gulf restoration from reparations from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, he noted. "We're hoping that NOAA will use some of that money to fund a gear transition program," Mr. Wheatley said. But first NOAA would have to enact a policy eliminating longlines from the Gulf of Mexico.
A few months into his pilot program, Dr. Kerstetter said he and the fishermen collaborators were "still working out the kinks." Yet the captains are getting better and better at fishing with the new gear and are catching more and more swordfish and yellowfin tuna., he added.
"There's a learning curve process that happens, like anything else in life," Dr. Kerstetter said.
 An earlier version of this post referred incompletely to the status of the Atlantic bluefin tuna. While the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers it a threatened species, the federal Fish and Wildlife Service has declined to list it as one. The wildlife service does categorize it as a "species of concern" because of overfishing, however, and has promised to reassess its status early next year.

HEADLINE: A Mood of Gloom Afflicts the Romney Campaign

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: A dark mood descends on the Romney campaign as it lurches from problem to problem. 

 BODY:
 8:42 p.m. | Updated SALT LAKE CITY - Mitt Romney's traveling press secretary walked to the back of the candidate's plane midflight on Tuesday and teasingly asked a pair of journalists in an exit row if they were "willing and able to assist in case of an emergency."
Under the circumstances, it was hard to tell whether it was a question or a request.
A palpably gloomy and openly frustrated mood has begun to creep into Mr. Romney's campaign for president. Well practiced in the art of lurching from public relations crisis to public relations crisis, his team seemed to reach its limit as it digested a ubiquitous set of video clips that showed their boss candidly describing nearly half of the country's population as government-dependent "victims," and saying that he would "kick the ball down the road" on the biggest foreign policy challenge of the past few decades, the Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
Grim-faced aides acknowledged that it was an unusually dark moment, made worse by the self-inflicted, seemingly avoidable nature of the wound. In low-volume, out-of-the-way conversations, a few of them are now wondering whether victory is still possible and whether they are entering McCain-Palin ticket territory.
It may prove a fleeting anxiety: national polls show the race remains close, even though Mr. Romney trails in some key swing states. 
Still, a flustered adviser, describing the mood, said that the campaign was turning into a vulgar, unprintable phrase.
Aides did little to hide their annoyance: on Monday night, a Romney aide cursed loudly as he tried to corral reporters into an impromptu news conference in Costa Mesa, Calif.
Mr. Romney himself seemed pensive on the early-morning flight Tuesday from California to Utah, sitting alone with a white legal pad and a pen as he picked at a vegetarian breakfast burrito. An aide said that he had eaten dinner alone in his hotel room the night before as the video controversy began to unfold. 
The campaign did its best to change the subject. At an airport in Salt Lake City, Kevin Madden, a senior adviser, waved a group of reporters over to look at his iPhone. It displayed a headline in the Romney-friendly Drudge Report about a poll that showed the presidential race tightening.
A few hours later, Mr. Romney's staff members summoned a handful of reporters to watch him carry four of his young grandchildren across a tarmac here and onto his plane for a tour.
But the video kept coming up anyway. When pressed, Mr. Madden offered a relentlessly on-message reply to questions about the candidate's mood and reaction to the drip-drip-drip release of the fund-raiser video by Mother Jones magazine.
"We're still focused," he said. "This is an election that is focused on the economy. It's focused on the direction of the country."
Mr. Madden wanted to be clear: despite the video, Mr. Romney was focused, a word he used eight times. "We remain pretty focused and determined," he said, before opting for a stronger adjective. "Very focused and determined," he said.
The campaign did its best to blunt the onslaught, starting on Monday afternoon. 
Around 4 p.m., Garrett Jackson, Mr. Romney's closest aide, showed the candidate the grainy video from the fund-raiser on an iPad during a car ride.
It was a buzz kill: Mr. Romney had just finished his inaugural intelligence briefing at a local F.B.I. building, a ritual reserved for those just inches from the presidency.
The next minute, he was watching himself deliver those words - about the "47 percent" and "dependents" - to a group of wealthy campaign donors in Florida.
Mr. Romney and his advisers quickly grasped the severity of the video. A decision was made: Mr. Romney must go in front of cameras immediately to explain himself, lest questions about the video linger and overshadow two full days of his campaign at a crucial stage in the general election.
By Tuesday afternoon, the campaign seemed to find its footing. Aides inside Mr. Romney's Boston headquarters began highlighting a video of their own: a 1998 clip showing Barack Obama, then a state senator, saying that he wanted the government to facilitate the distribution of wealth. "I actually believe in redistribution," Mr. Obama said on the tape.
Soon, Mr. Romney was on Fox News, his television comfort zone, mocking the video. Twitter lit up with Romney aides taking the president to task for his word choice.
Suddenly, the mood in the Romney camp began to perk up, ever so slightly. 
As the campaign plane landed in Dallas on Tuesday night, Mr. Romney got on the intercom to welcome home two reporters whose families live in Texas, one from CNN, the other from NBC News. He said he was sorry to miss a planned pool party that one of the reporters planned to hold in the evening. "I was a little offended not to be invited for cobbler," he said, playfully. He asked that some be brought to him on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Some Big Corporations Don't Pay Taxes, Either

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Despite complaints from executives and Republican candidates, American corporations are not overtaxed, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
On Sept. 13, Harold Hamm, chairman and chief executive of Continental Resources, testified before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce about achieving energy independence. He said his company, an oil producer, could produce much more if federal policies didn't hold it back. Among them is the tax system. Mr. Hamm said his company paid an effective tax rate of 38 percent.
One often hears corporate executives make such assertions. Republicans always accept them at face value, because to them there is no public policy problem that isn't caused by high taxes. Tax cuts are their solution to just about every problem. Cutting the corporate tax rate is among the key measures that all Republicans favor to stimulate growth.
One problem with the Republican theory is that many big corporations actually pay little, if any, federal income tax. For example, The New York Times has reported that General Electric, the sixth-largest corporation in the United States, earned $14.2 billion in 2010, but disclosed in federal filings that it had no federal tax liability.
This disparity between the high taxes that many people say they believe American corporations pay and the low rate they actually pay applies to Mr. Hamm's business as well. Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed group, looked at Continental Resources' financial reports, where it must disclose tax payments, and found that in 2011 it paid a federal tax rate of 1.9 percent on profits of close to $700 million. Its average federal tax rate over the last five years was 2.2 percent.
According to Citizens for Tax Justice, G.E. paid a federal tax rate about the same as Continental Resources' over the last 10 years - an average of 2.3 percent, including four years in which it received a net tax refund.
When poor people pay no federal income taxes and get a government refund because of such programs as the earned-income tax credit, Republicans are incensed, implying that if only the poor paid their fair share that the deficit would disappear. They never suggest that corporations like G.E. pay their fair share, even though the G.E. example is far from unique, according to Citizens for Tax Justice.
The complexity of the corporate income tax makes it easy to evade and avoid American taxes. Edward D. Kleinbard, a professor of tax law at the University of Southern California, points to the easy availability of tax havens, where corporations artificially book their profits and avoid taxation on them.
I had a personal experience with such tax havens recently. I needed a copy of Microsoft Word for a new computer and went to Microsoft.com to buy and download it. But my credit card company refused the charge. When I checked to see what the problem was, I was told that the credit card company was suspicious because the charge went to a company based in Luxembourg.
Luxembourg is, of course, a notorious tax haven. Arranging to realize its profits in such places has long been a tax-avoidance policy practiced by Microsoft and other big corporations. According to a July 22 report by the London-based Tax Justice Network, as much as $32 trillion of global financial wealth may be parked in the world's tax havens.
Even without taking account of offshore tax havens and other aggressive tax avoidance activities, corporate taxes are grossly overrated as a cost of doing business in the United States. According to the Office of Management and Budget, the corporate income tax raised just 1.2 percent of the gross domestic product last year. Even in 2007, before the economic crisis, it raised only 2.7 percent of G.D.P. This is well down from the 1950s, when the corporate tax raised twice as much revenue as a share of G.D.P.
Republicans often point to the statutory corporate tax rate in the United States as evidence that American companies are overtaxed. Indeed, it is true that the United States has the highest statutory central government tax rate among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The combined statutory rate in the United States is 39.2 percent, including state taxes, compared with an average of 29.6 percent in the O.E.C.D.
However, as a Sept. 13 report from the Congressional Research Service explains, looking only at the statutory rate is highly misleading as an indication of the burden of the corporate tax. That is because it does not take account of the many tax expenditures that reduce the effective tax rate paid by American corporations. In 2011, they reduced corporate tax revenues by $159 billion.
As a consequence, the weighted effective tax rate - taxes as a share of profits - is 27.1 percent in the United States, which is below the 27.7 percent average rate of O.E.C.D. nations. The weighted average marginal tax rate on corporations - the tax on each additional dollar earned - is 20.2 percent in the United States, compared with 18.3 percent in the O.E.C.D.
For these reasons, the investor Warren Buffett says it's "a myth that American corporations are paying 35 percent or anything like it."
The Congressional Research Service report also notes that in the United States corporate taxes as a share of G.D.P. were the third lowest among all O.E.C.D. countries in 2009 - 1.7 percent of G.D.P. (including state taxes), compared with an O.E.C.D. average of 2.8 percent of G.D.P. Even Ireland, which conservatives often point to has having an exemplary corporate tax system, raised corporate taxes equal to 2.4 percent of G.D.P.
One continuing confusion in the corporate tax debate is who, exactly, pays it. Corporations, after all, are not entities separate from their owners (shareholders), employees and customers. They are the ones who pay the tax, but economists have been debating about who and to what degree for a century.
A Treasury Department report in May concluded that 82 percent of the corporate tax is borne by capital, with 18 percent borne by labor. Contrary to popular belief, none of the tax is shifted to consumers, which stands to reason because prices are set by producers that pay different tax rates or may even be tax-exempt.
The private Tax Policy Center published a study on Sept. 13 with similar conclusions. It estimates that 20 percent of the corporate tax is paid by labor, 20 percent is borne by the "normal" return to capital - roughly, the risk-free interest rate - and 60 percent by the "supernormal" return to capital. The latter is the extent to which the return to corporate stock has historically exceeded the risk-free interest rate.
One driving force for tax reform is a widespread belief, on both sides of the aisle, that the statutory corporate tax rate should be reduced. That is fine as long as the tax base is broadened by eliminating loopholes. But the idea that cutting the tax rate is a magic bullet to jump-start growth is nonsense, because corporate taxes are, in fact, quite low.

 Today's Times 

        
President Obama harnessed the full powers of incumbency on Monday after he filed a broad new case against China with the World Trade Organization, accusing it of unfairly subsidizing exports of cars and auto parts, Mark Landler reports. With Mitt Romney's campaign arguing that Mr. Obama is not doing enough to protect American workers, the president drew an explicit link between his action on China and the economic travails of "working men and women on the assembly lines" across the Midwest.

        
Many Latino leaders are infuriated by a White House ruling that excludes young illegal immigrants - who were recently told they could apply to remain in the country without fear of deportation - from health insurance coverage under President Obama's health care overhaul, Robert Pear reports. The administration views the immigration initiative and health coverage as separate matters.

        
Mitt Romney was caught on video giving a blunt political and cultural assessment of nearly half of American voters at a private campaign reception, Michael D. Shear reports. It offers a rare glimpse into Mr. Romney's personal views and undermines an attribute that his aides have long argued would appeal to independent voters: a sense that he is an empathetic and caring man.

        
Though Mitt Romney tried on Monday to give new direction to his campaign with more specifics about his proposed policies, his campaign continued to be hit with reports of infighting amongst his team and the video of him describing almost half of Americans as "dependent upon government," Jim Rutenberg and Ashley Parker report.
 Around the Web

HEADLINE: Sept. 17: Electoral College May Not Help Obama

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: As of Monday, the FiveThirtyEight forecast showed that President Obama was more likely to lose the Electoral College while winning the popular vote than the other way around. 

 BODY:
The FiveThirtyEight presidential forecast for Monday was essentially unchanged, with President Obama having a 74.8 percent chance of winning another term. Taken on the whole, Monday's data was consistent with the current "story" the forecast model is telling about the race, which is that Mr. Obama's polls have declined slightly from their post-convention highs, but are also still slightly better than his preconvention polls. 
If you look hard enough, of course, you can find polls where Mr. Obama's convention bounce has evaporated completely - or others in which it hasn't declined at all. But the forecast model, whatever its strengths or weaknesses, is pretty good at determining what the consensus of the data says at any given time.
So at this moment of relative calm in the overall forecast, let's take a moment to peek at the Electoral College. I'll have an overview of the status of individual swing states in The New York Times Magazine this week, so our focus here will be a little more "macro," on the relationship between the Electoral College and the national popular vote.
As of Monday, the forecast gave Mr. Obama a 76.1 percent chance of winning the popular vote, but a 74.8 percent chance of winning the Electoral College. In other words, as of right now, Mr. Obama is more likely to lose the Electoral College while winning the popular vote than the other way around. 
The difference isn't large, but it generally goes against the conventional wisdom that Mr. Obama's position is superior in the Electoral College than in the popular vote. 
For that matter, it also goes against what our model had found at some earlier points in the race, when Mr. Obama's position in the polls seemed to be more robust in swing states than in the country as a whole, and it therefore perceived a slight advantage for him in the Electoral College.
But in general since the conventions, Mr. Obama's bounce has been a bit more apparent in polls of noncompetitive states - or states that are on the fringe of being competitive - than in the true "tipping point states" that are most likely to determine the election. 
Mr. Obama's polls in the tipping point states aren't bad by any means - he's led in the vast majority of them. But they haven't conveyed any particular strength there. For every set of very strong swing-state numbers, like the trio of NBC News/Marist polls that Mr. Obama got in Virginia, Florida and Ohio last week, there seems to be a mediocre data point for him. On Monday, for instance, Public Policy Polling released a survey showing Mr. Obama just one point ahead in Wisconsin, a state we had been curious about. That represents a technical improvement for Mr. Obama over Public Policy Polling's last survey of Wisconsin, which had Mitt Romney up by one point. But since Public Policy Polling generally shows pretty good numbers for Mr. Obama - and this particular poll was commissioned for a liberal group, Democracy for America - it's hard to view it as all that much of a positive for him.
Mr. Obama's polling has been somewhat more favorable in Ohio. Really, whenever we're talking about the relationship between the Electoral College and the popular vote, a lot of what we're talking about is just Ohio, since it has better than a one-in-three chance of being the tipping-point state.
Even so, Mr. Obama's current projected margin of victory in Ohio is 3.1 percentage points - slightly less than the lead the model gives him in the national popular vote, which was 3.3 percentage points as of Monday's forecast. In other words, Mr. Obama is not especially likely to win Ohio despite losing the popular vote nationwide; it could happen, but the reverse scenario is at least equally likely.
Of course, Ohio is normally just slightly Republican-leaning relative to the country as a whole, so the fact that it's polling almost exactly at the national average is a positive for Mr. Obama.
But there are other states in which Mr. Obama seems to be underperforming slightly. In 2008, for instance, Mr. Obama won Colorado by a wider margin than he did Ohio. This year, however, his projected margin of victory in Colorado is 2.3 percentage points, slightly less than in Ohio - and also slightly less than his margin in the national popular vote. Similarly, Mr. Obama's projected margin of victory in Virginia right now is 1.3 percentage points. 
If you total up the electoral votes from the states where Mr. Obama is currently running better than he is in Ohio, as according to our forecasts, they equal 263 electoral votes - not quite enough for him to win.
To the extent that Mr. Obama has an advantage, it's that he has a lot of options for how to get those remaining electoral votes, including any one of Virginia, Colorado, Ohio and Florida (although the 263 total includes a couple of states, like Wisconsin and Iowa, where Mr. Obama's position is not particularly safe).
But what would really signal strength for Mr. Obama is if Ohio were his backup plan. For instance, if he led by four or five points in Colorado right now, rather than two or three, then he'd have a winning map without Ohio, meaning that Ohio would represent almost pure electoral upside for him. But we're not seeing polls in Colorado, or Virginia, that give him a lead like that on a consistent basis. Right now, Ohio is his "Plan A."
Still, it would be possible to overrate the importance of this. In the chart below, I've listed the probability of each candidate winning the Electoral College conditional upon achieving a particular result in the popular vote, as based on the 25,001 simulations that the model ran on Monday.
For instance, if Mr. Obama won the popular vote by between 0.001 and 0.5 percentage points over Mr. Romney, the simulations find that he'd have a 55 percent chance of winning the Electoral College also. If he won the popular vote by between half a percentage point and one point, he'd win the Electoral College about three-quarters of the time.
Mr. Romney's numbers are ever-so-slightly stronger in each category. He'd have a 69 percent chance, not 55 percent, of winning the Electoral College if he won the popular vote by less than half a point. And he'd have an 83 percent chance of winning the Electoral College conditional upon winning the popular vote by between half and one percentage point.
Once a candidate's advantage in the popular vote becomes larger than about a percentage point, however, the odds are strongly against a split between the Electoral College and the popular vote. Mr. Obama won the Electoral College in 88 percent of the simulations that he won the popular vote by between one and one a half percentage points, for instance, and 96 percent of the time that he won it by between one and a half and two percentage points.
And in none of the 25,001 simulations did a candidate win the popular vote by more than three percentage points and lose the Electoral College. If there were the possibility of a distortion that large, we'd have seen it in the swing state polls by now - but instead, they've tracked pretty close to the national averages. 
And really, that's about how it should be. Many of the swing states - certainly Ohio, for example - resemble the country in microcosm. Perhaps you can run just slightly better or weaker in one of them because of local economic conditions, or some quirky regional issue - and to the extent that stuff matters, we'll try to sort it out. But in general, if you're winning over the sorts of voters who you'll need to win to take Ohio, you'll probably be connecting with a winning coalition of voters in most of the other swing states.
 Housekeeping: When There Are Multiple Versions of a Poll 
On an unrelated note, we're starting to see more cases in which multiple versions of the same poll are published - for instance, the figures among both likely voters and registered voters, or as listed with and without "leaners" (voters who initially say they're undecided but pick a candidate after an additional prompt from the interviewer).
Sometimes the polling firm will emphasize one or another of these numbers in its news release. (Rasmussen Reports, for instance, has begun to publish the results with leaners in its tracking poll, but has been highlighting the "without leaners" version in its write-ups.) But we don't look at the news release - we look at the fine print, and we need consistent procedures to handle these cases.
The procedures that we've been following all year when these situations come up are as follows:
A poll of likely voters is always preferred to a poll of registered voters. A poll of registered voters, similarly, is always preferred to a poll of all adults. The model applies a likely-voter adjustment in cases where only registered-voter or adult numbers are listed.The "with leaners" version of the poll is always preferred to the version without it.A different case is when the pollster "allocates" the undecided voters based on some mathematical formula, rather than from their responses to the survey. I strongly dislike this practice - it's the pollster's job to convey the preferences of the voters who do commit to a candidate, and up to the rest of us to determine what the undecided voters might do. So we use the pre-allocation numbers, where available.If a poll lists the results with and without third-party candidates included, we simply average the two sets of results. (There's one condition here: the third-party candidates actually have to have a reasonable likelihood of appearing on the state's ballot. If a pollster tested a hypothetical three-way matchup between Mr. Obama, Mr. Romney, and Donald Trump, we wouldn't use those numbers in our model.)Pollsters will sometimes also publish numbers using multiple turnout models, e.g. assuming a higher and lower turnout. We simply average all such numbers, rather than guessing at what the "official" version of the poll is.
Some of these cases are debatable. I haven't investigated, for example, whether polls do better with or without third-party candidates listed, and the answer may depend on the circumstances. But the point is that we do not want to make a lot of judgment calls on a poll-by-poll basis. So we apply these rules consistently.

HEADLINE: Behind Goldman Sachs's Success Is a Focus on Survival

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: Goldman Sachs has made an effort to heal self-inflicted wounds and maintain its dominance in investment banking. 

 BODY:
It wasn't long ago that Goldman Sachs was painted as an outsize villain of the financial crisis, and its future seemed hazy. Today, however, Goldman Sachs has retained its clients and its dominance. And recent missteps by its competitors are putting the investment bank in pole position to profit when a recovery comes.
It's not here yet. The investment banking business is in a miserable state. According to Dealogic, worldwide revenue for the investment banking industry was down 26 percent in the first half of 2012 from the same period a year ago.
Goldman, too, is suffering in this downturn, but it has held its investment banking pre-eminence. In the first half of 2012, according to Dealogic, Goldman Sachs ranked third among banks in domestic and global equity capital markets rankings. In the league tables for global advice on mergers and acquisitions, Goldman was No. 1 worldwide and in the United States.
Over all, according to Dealogic, the firm had $1.7 billion in investment banking revenue for the first half of 2012 and was third in the global rankings. This is a feat since the firm doesn't have the lending capability of JPMorgan Chase, No. 1 in the global rankings, or Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, No. 2.
As for sales and trading, traditionally the heart of the banks' revenue, Goldman's institutional client services segment had $9.6 billion in net revenue in the first half of this year - down about 5 percent from the previous year. But compare this with Morgan Stanley, where sales and trading revenue was $4.4 billion, down more than 32 percent.
The numbers show that despite contentions that Goldman had traded against its clients by shorting the housing markets, clients have not fled. And some of Goldman's competitors have changed or made missteps in ways that will help the bank in the future.
JPMorgan, for one, has been hurt by the billions in trading losses out of its chief investment office unit. The bank's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has to confront the likelihood of significantly increased oversight by regulators.
Another big competitor, Barclays, has been bogged down by an interest rate manipulation scandal that forced an upheaval in its executive ranks. It, too, will also face increased regulatory oversight, not to mention litigation.
Citigroup is sorting out whether it wants to be a consumer bank or an investment bank or something in between as it tries to achieve a turnaround. But the bank clearly no longer has aspirations to be the global supermarket that its former chief executive, Sanford I. Weill, hoped for it to be. Where Citigroup's investment banking division fits in this puzzle is still unknown, probably even to the bank's executives.
The vision in the late 1990s was that a bank could offer both commercial and investment banking services and that it could leverage its ability to lend billions of dollars to gain investment banking business. The recent troubles of the big banks suggest that this dream is over.
Any benefits from being both a commercial lender and an investment bank are outweighed by huge regulatory hurdles. The army of regulators and compliance officers required to oversee the operations of these banks is an increasing drain on their ability to make money.
Goldman has taken steps to heal itself from self-inflicted wounds. In the uproar after the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs formed a business standards committee to examine practices and recommend change. The committeeput forth 39 recommendations to improve governance and client relations. In response, the firm has fundamentally realigned its business segments. Goldman has also overhauled its board, revised its public relations strategy and put in place stronger clawback policies.
The firm has also made every effort to move past financial crisis allegations. It paid $550 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission accusations that it misled investors in a mortgage-related security. Recently the Justice Department announced that it would not pursue charges related to accusations that Goldman shorted the housing market while selling products to clients betting the opposite.
The financial crisis has also forced Morgan Stanley - long Goldman's main rival in investment banking - to change its business model substantially. Morgan Stanley has struggled with its smaller capital base and an undiversified business. To solve this problem, it recently reached an agreement to acquire the entire Smith Barney brokerage operations. But that means that Morgan Stanley may become more of an asset manager than an investment bank. And the controversy over the Facebook initial public offering is not likely to have helped Morgan Stanley, which led the offering and has been vying with Goldman to underwrite other hot technology I.P.O.'s.
As a result, Goldman is becoming the last pure-play, big investment bank. In a world where business consultants preach that a focus on your best business lines is necessary to success, Goldman is likely to have an advantage over the banking conglomerates.
And instead of diversifying, Goldman is taking steps to retain its focus. Goldman did not spin off its private equity arm, GS Capital Partners, to comply with the Volcker Rule. Instead, it kept the operation in-house by financing it through outside money rather than Goldman's. Other banks have also retained their private equity arms, but Goldman's was always the biggest and it faced the most pressure to divest. Keeping GS Capital Partners will maintain the firms' edge in playing a part in takeover deals.
Still, it's not going to be an easy ride for the bank. Goldman will continue to be a flash point and a target as a symbol for the financial crisis and greed in general. Moreover, Greg Smith, the former Goldman employee who publicly resigned through an opinion article in The New York Times, has a memoir coming out this fall called "Why I Left Goldman Sachs."
It may again send Goldman into damage control mode. But if the firm's clients haven't left already, why would they now? Goldman is more regulated now than before the financial crisis, but it seems as if it will not face prosecution for any of its activities, and its competitors are having more problems with regulators. Mr. Smith's book is unlikely to change anything.
The stock market agrees. Goldman's stock price is up about 25 percent this year, beating out JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup.
Investment banking may be down, but it will eventually return. And the remarkable story will be that Goldman, despite the controversies it has faced, has put itself in a position to not only profit but continue its dominance. It's a case study in business survival and reputational repair. The protesters at Occupy Wall Street will not be happy. But neither will Goldman's competitors.

HEADLINE: In Buyback Deal, Alibaba Gets Half of Yahoo's Stake

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Alibaba Group said on Tuesday that it has closed on the repurchase of a 20 percent stake in itself from Yahoo, taking the first major step toward a long-held goal of regaining full control of its destiny. 

 BODY:
 8:14 p.m. | Updated 
Yahoo closed on the sale of half of its stake in the Alibaba Group of China, the company said Tuesday, giving it $3 billion to return to its shareholders.
Some investors had fretted that Yahoo would decide against doling proceeds from the sale to shareholders, after the company's new chief executive, Marissa Mayer, said last month that she was "reviewing" its business strategy. To some, it suggested that Ms. Mayer, a former Google executive, was more keen to hold onto the money for some other use, including acquisitions.
But it appears that Ms. Mayer has decided that a payout to investors, including the hedge fund manager and Yahoo board member Daniel S. Loeb, who holds about a 6 percent stake, was in the company's best interest.
 It has already spent $646 million on stock buybacks since May, in what it called a "down payment" to its stockholders.
In selling about 20 percent of Alibaba's stock back to the company, Yahoo will reap about $7.6 billion before taxes. The $3 billion represents about 85 percent of the net cash proceeds from the sale, with Yahoo also receiving preferred shares in its partner.
The deal, struck in May, is part of a comprehensive agreement worked out between Alibaba and Yahoo, beginning the transformation of a partnership that has often proved contentious.
The two companies' alliance began when Yahoo bought a 40 percent stake in Alibaba in late 2005. But as Yahoo began to falter, falling behind newer rivals like Google and then Facebook, its stake in Alibaba leapt in value.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Yahoo's remaining stake in Alibaba was valued at about $8.1 billion, representing about 43 percent of the American company's $18.9 billion market value.
Over the last few years, both sides have engaged in on-again, off-again talks about the return of that stake.
Under the terms of the agreement, Yahoo will sell half of its stake back now. It will sell an additional 10 percent of Alibaba when the Chinese Internet company files to go public in the next few years, and then divest the remainder sometime after that.
For Alibaba, Tuesday's announcement is the biggest step yet toward its long-held goal of regaining full control of its future. Still privately held, it has taken a number of steps toward becoming publicly traded, including finally striking a deal with Yahoo.
Alibaba has spent the last several months crisscrossing the world, raising the requisite financing for the stock buyback from investors like the China Investment Corporation, the Chinese private equity firms Boyu Capital and Citic Capital and the China Development Bank. Existing investors like Silver Lake, DST Global and Temasek also participated.
And it arranged $2 billion in financing from a number of international banks.
"The completion of this transaction begins a new chapter in our relationship with Yahoo," Jack Ma, Alibaba's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "We are grateful for Yahoo's support of our growth over the past seven years, and we are pleased to be able to deliver meaningful returns to our shareholders including Yahoo."
Ms. Mayer said in a statement: "This yields a substantial return for investors while retaining a meaningful amount of capital within the company to invest in future growth."

HEADLINE: What Bush Knew, and Romney Doesn't

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican nominee has failed to distance himself from his predecessor's failures, but he's also failed to imitate his successes. 

 BODY:
I used my Campaign Stops column last week to make the case (not for the first time) that Mitt Romney is struggling to defeat Barack Obama in large part because the public's memory of how the Bush era ended remains a major drag on the Republican Party's political prospects, and Romney hasn't done nearly enough to define himself as a post-Bush figure. But with the whole political world talking about the leaked fundraiser tape in which Romney channels an inaccurate and self-defeating right-wing talking point to basically write off 47 percent of America as irresponsible, dependent, guaranteed-to-vote Obama moochers, it's worth pointing out that the current Republican nominee has also conspicuously failing to learn from George W. Bush's substantial political successes.
What the younger Bush did while running for president in 2000 was uncomplicated, disciplined, and effective. He picked a few issues - education, in particular, but also health care and immigration and poverty - where voters trusted Democrats more than Republicans and made it his business to talk about them almost as often as he talked about traditional Republican strengths like taxes and defense. He spoke consistently about bipartisanship and changing the tone in Washington, constantly invoking his own record in Texas as an example. When he championed conservative ideas, he stressed their impact on the middle class and the working poor, rather than just lionizing entrepreneurs and businessmen. When he showed an unconventional side - on immigration reform, say, or faith-based initiatives - the aim was always to make the G.O.P. seem as inclusive as possible, and to cast himself as a president for all Americans, even constituencies that would never vote for him.
He campaigned, in other words, in a way designed to reassure non-ideological voters that he cared about the issues that they cared about, and that he would be something other than a down-the-line ideologue if elected. In the process, he created clear distance between himself and the unpopular national Republican leadership (Gingrich, Dole, his own father) that preceded him. And he also put some distance between himself and what might have otherwise been an obvious liberal line of attack - that he was an out-of-touch Republican fortunate son, with no understanding of ordinary people's lives and struggles.
The success of this strategy tends to be underappreciated because Bush fell just short in the popular vote in 2000 and then won more on terrorism than on domestic policy in 2004. But when you consider the edge that Gore should have had as the heir to the Clinton boom and compare Bush's 2000 performance to every other Republican nominee in the last two decades - his father, Bob Dole, John McCain, and now perhaps Romney as well - his approach looks pretty impressive. (Republicans like to blame Perot for their poor showing in 1992 and 1996, but the Perot vote would have probably broken for Clinton or split down the middle, and anyway his candidacy was a symptom of G.O.P. unpopularity, not its cause.) As Reihan Salam and I argued in our 2008 book "Grand New Party," the demographics of Bush's near-majority in 2000 and majority in 2004 suggested a plausible outline for a post-Reagan right-of-center coalition: One that would make up for the gradual leftward tilt of former Rockefeller Republicans by winning more working class whites and more middle-class Hispanics, and one that would compensate for G.O.P. weakness along the Pacific Coast and the Acela corridor by making deeper inroads in the Southwest and Middle West.
Now of course that coalition fell apart: Bush's policies didn't deliver as promised, he presided over a series of foreign and domestic debacles, and he left office in the midst of an economic meltdown. And the stink of failure around Bushism produced an understandable backlash on the right against "compassionate conservatism" and all its works.
But those failures and that backlash did not change the basic realities of national coalition-building; it just required some rethinking about what kind of policy mix a center-right coalition should pursue. Nor did it make it impossible for a Republican presidential candidate to pivot toward the center after a primary campaign; it just changed the issues that such a pivot would have needed to focus on and exploit.
So Mitt Romney was never going to be to run for president as the candidate of, say, comprehensive immigration reform and an individual mandate to purchase health insurance; his post-Bush base would not allow it. (And for good reason!) But he could have run for president, as various right-of-center voices have pointed out, as the candidate of a kind of pro-market populism - as a foe of "bigness" on Wall Street and Washington alike, as a champion of tax policy that favored families as well as entrepreneurs, as a champion of a more-than-notional replacement for the Obama health care bill, and so forth. This kind of agenda wouldn't have represented a repudiation of the Tea Party spirit. It just would have sifted through the Tea Party's rather inchoate mix of ideological impulses and policy prescriptions, emphasizing some and de-emphasizing others, and looking for the places where right-wing populism and the mainstream intersect.
There were times during the primary campaign when it seemed like Romney intended to do just that. He talked constantly about the middle class, and refused to jump on the flat tax bandwagon. He declined to savage the president as a socialist. He even refused to repudiate his Massachusetts health care bill, which was every political consultant save Stuart Stevens apparently told him had to be abandoned outright if he wanted to win over the party's base. He did end up being boxed into an implausible across-the-board tax cut, but that was a pander that could have been finessed into an effective general-election message without too much difficulty.
But after months and months of general election campaigning, no such message has emerged. And in its absence, Romney finds himself conducting a winnable (yes, still) campaign from the weakest possible position. By branding himself as a generic Republican with no particularly unconventional ideas of his own, he's managed to associate himself with all the party's Bush-era failures, while imitating none of its success.

HEADLINE: Sept. 17: Electoral College May Not Help Obama

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: As of Monday, the FiveThirtyEight forecast showed that President Obama was more likely to lose the Electoral College while winning the popular vote than the other way around. 

 BODY:
The FiveThirtyEight presidential forecast for Monday was essentially unchanged, with President Obama having a 74.8 percent chance of winning another term. Taken on the whole, Monday's data was consistent with the current "story" the forecast model is telling about the race, which is that Mr. Obama's polls have declined slightly from their post-convention highs, but are also still slightly better than his preconvention polls. 
If you look hard enough, of course, you can find polls where Mr. Obama's convention bounce has evaporated completely - or others in which it hasn't declined at all. But the forecast model, whatever its strengths or weaknesses, is pretty good at determining what the consensus of the data says at any given time.
So at this moment of relative calm in the overall forecast, let's take a moment to peek at the Electoral College. I'll have an overview of the status of individual swing states in The New York Times Magazine this week, so our focus here will be a little more "macro," on the relationship between the Electoral College and the national popular vote.
As of Monday, the forecast gave Mr. Obama a 76.1 percent chance of winning the popular vote, but a 74.8 percent chance of winning the Electoral College. In other words, as of right now, Mr. Obama is more likely to lose the Electoral College while winning the popular vote than the other way around. 
The difference isn't large, but it generally goes against the conventional wisdom that Mr. Obama's position is superior in the Electoral College than in the popular vote. 
For that matter, it also goes against what our model had found at some earlier points in the race, when Mr. Obama's position in the polls seemed to be more robust in swing states than in the country as a whole, and it therefore perceived a slight advantage for him in the Electoral College.
But in general since the conventions, Mr. Obama's bounce has been a bit more apparent in polls of noncompetitive states - or states that are on the fringe of being competitive - than in the true "tipping point states" that are most likely to determine the election. 
Mr. Obama's polls in the tipping point states aren't bad by any means - he's led in the vast majority of them. But they haven't conveyed any particular strength there. For every set of very strong swing-state numbers, like the trio of NBC News/Marist polls that Mr. Obama got in Virginia, Florida and Ohio last week, there seems to be a mediocre data point for him. On Monday, for instance, Public Policy Polling released a survey showing Mr. Obama just one point ahead in Wisconsin, a state we had been curious about. That represents a technical improvement for Mr. Obama over Public Policy Polling's last survey of Wisconsin, which had Mitt Romney up by one point. But since Public Policy Polling generally shows pretty good numbers for Mr. Obama - and this particular poll was commissioned for a liberal group, Democracy for America - it's hard to view it as all that much of a positive for him.
Mr. Obama's polling has been somewhat more favorable in Ohio. Really, whenever we're talking about the relationship between the Electoral College and the popular vote, a lot of what we're talking about is just Ohio, since it has better than a one-in-three chance of being the tipping-point state.
Even so, Mr. Obama's current projected margin of victory in Ohio is 3.1 percentage points - slightly less than the lead the model gives him in the national popular vote, which was 3.3 percentage points as of Monday's forecast. In other words, Mr. Obama is not especially likely to win Ohio despite losing the popular vote nationwide; it could happen, but the reverse scenario is at least equally likely.
Of course, Ohio is normally just slightly Republican-leaning relative to the country as a whole, so the fact that it's polling almost exactly at the national average is a positive for Mr. Obama.
But there are other states in which Mr. Obama seems to be underperforming slightly. In 2008, for instance, Mr. Obama won Colorado by a wider margin than he did Ohio. This year, however, his projected margin of victory in Colorado is 2.3 percentage points, slightly less than in Ohio - and also slightly less than his margin in the national popular vote. Similarly, Mr. Obama's projected margin of victory in Virginia right now is 1.3 percentage points. 
If you total up the electoral votes from the states where Mr. Obama is currently running better than he is in Ohio, as according to our forecasts, they equal 263 electoral votes - not quite enough for him to win.
To the extent that Mr. Obama has an advantage, it's that he has a lot of options for how to get those remaining electoral votes, including any one of Virginia, Colorado, Ohio and Florida (although the 263 total includes a couple of states, like Wisconsin and Iowa, where Mr. Obama's position is not particularly safe).
But what would really signal strength for Mr. Obama is if Ohio were his backup plan. For instance, if he led by four or five points in Colorado right now, rather than two or three, then he'd have a winning map without Ohio, meaning that Ohio would represent almost pure electoral upside for him. But we're not seeing polls in Colorado, or Virginia, that give him a lead like that on a consistent basis. Right now, Ohio is his "Plan A."
Still, it would be possible to overrate the importance of this. In the chart below, I've listed the probability of each candidate winning the Electoral College conditional upon achieving a particular result in the popular vote, as based on the 25,001 simulations that the model ran on Monday.
For instance, if Mr. Obama won the popular vote by between 0.001 and 0.5 percentage points over Mr. Romney, the simulations find that he'd have a 55 percent chance of winning the Electoral College also. If he won the popular vote by between half a percentage point and one point, he'd win the Electoral College about three-quarters of the time.
Mr. Romney's numbers are ever-so-slightly stronger in each category. He'd have a 69 percent chance, not 55 percent, of winning the Electoral College if he won the popular vote by less than half a point. And he'd have an 83 percent chance of winning the Electoral College conditional upon winning the popular vote by between half and one percentage point.
Once a candidate's advantage in the popular vote becomes larger than about a percentage point, however, the odds are strongly against a split between the Electoral College and the popular vote. Mr. Obama won the Electoral College in 88 percent of the simulations that he won the popular vote by between one and one a half percentage points, for instance, and 96 percent of the time that he won it by between one and a half and two percentage points.
And in none of the 25,001 simulations did a candidate win the popular vote by more than three percentage points and lose the Electoral College. If there were the possibility of a distortion that large, we'd have seen it in the swing state polls by now - but instead, they've tracked pretty close to the national averages. 
And really, that's about how it should be. Many of the swing states - certainly Ohio, for example - resemble the country in microcosm. Perhaps you can run just slightly better or weaker in one of them because of local economic conditions, or some quirky regional issue - and to the extent that stuff matters, we'll try to sort it out. But in general, if you're winning over the sorts of voters who you'll need to win to take Ohio, you'll probably be connecting with a winning coalition of voters in most of the other swing states.
 Housekeeping: When There Are Multiple Versions of a Poll 
On an unrelated note, we're starting to see more cases in which multiple versions of the same poll are published - for instance, the figures among both likely voters and registered voters, or as listed with and without "leaners" (voters who initially say they're undecided but pick a candidate after an additional prompt from the interviewer).
Sometimes the polling firm will emphasize one or another of these numbers in its news release. (Rasmussen Reports, for instance, has begun to publish the results with leaners in its tracking poll, but has been highlighting the "without leaners" version in its write-ups.) But we don't look at the news release - we look at the fine print, and we need consistent procedures to handle these cases.
The procedures that we've been following all year when these situations come up are as follows:
A poll of likely voters is always preferred to a poll of registered voters. A poll of registered voters, similarly, is always preferred to a poll of all adults. The model applies a likely-voter adjustment in cases where only registered-voter or adult numbers are listed.The "with leaners" version of the poll is always preferred to the version without it.A different case is when the pollster "allocates" the undecided voters based on some mathematical formula, rather than from their responses to the survey. I strongly dislike this practice - it's the pollster's job to convey the preferences of the voters who do commit to a candidate, and up to the rest of us to determine what the undecided voters might do. So we use the pre-allocation numbers, where available.If a poll lists the results with and without third-party candidates included, we simply average the two sets of results. (There's one condition here: the third-party candidates actually have to have a reasonable likelihood of appearing on the state's ballot. If a pollster tested a hypothetical three-way matchup between Mr. Obama, Mr. Romney, and Donald Trump, we wouldn't use those numbers in our model.)Pollsters will sometimes also publish numbers using multiple turnout models, e.g. assuming a higher and lower turnout. We simply average all such numbers, rather than guessing at what the "official" version of the poll is.
Some of these cases are debatable. I haven't investigated, for example, whether polls do better with or without third-party candidates listed, and the answer may depend on the circumstances. But the point is that we do not want to make a lot of judgment calls on a poll-by-poll basis. So we apply these rules consistently.

HEADLINE: What's in a Number? For the Ford Fusion, Marketing Gold

BYLINE: JONATHAN SCHULTZ


HIGHLIGHT: Alan R. Mulally, chief executive of Ford, was joined in Times Square on Tuesday by Ryan Seacrest to mark the Ford Fusion Hybrid's receiving a combined fuel-economy rating of 47 m.p.g. 

 BODY:
With the rest of the country fixated on another 47 -- or 46.4, if we're splitting hairs -- Ford created a blockwide buffer in Times Square on Tuesday where the number represented but one thing: a marketing opportunity.
The automaker announced on Tuesday that the 2013 Fusion Hybrid was certified by the Environmental Protection Agency at 47 miles per gallon in urban and highway driving, as well as on the combined cycle. Ford claimed the ratings made the Fusion Hybrid the most fuel-efficient midsize sedan in America.
The certification was celebrated in Times Square, with a Fusion Hybrid parked on a stage on which Alan R. Mulally, the chief executive of Ford Motor, appeared with Ryan Seacrest, the pitchman for the redesigned sedan.
"Today is about the Fusion Hybrid," Mr. Mulally, in his customary blue blazer and red necktie, said to attendees gathered around the stage and beyond the crowd-control barricades. Even so, he and Mr. Seacrest repeatedly attributed the phrase "most fuel-efficient" to the 2013 Fusion, without the Hybrid qualification. The base Fusion, equipped with a 2.5-liter Duratec in-line-4-cylinder engine and certified at 22 m.p.g. in urban and 34 m.p.g. in highway driving, offers competitive, but not class-leading, fuel economy.
Like the Focus, Fiesta and Escape, the Fusion illustrates the automaker's One Ford strategy, in which models sold around the world share design and engineering. Ford Europe, however, is expected to sell a hatchback and station wagon based on the Fusion, which is marketed there and in other international markets as the Mondeo.
Though European automakers are experiencing an overcapacity crisis, Mr. Mulally said Ford's strategy of developing new models even in times of wan demand would ultimately serve the company.
"Europe is a big concern for all of us, but we have committed 15 new vehicles in the next 5 years there," Mr. Mulally said.
According to Ford, the Fusion has expanded its share of the midsize sedan market in the United States from 6 percent to 12 percent since the model's introduction in 2006. Mr. Mulally expects the sedan to build on that share and even threaten the dominance of segment leaders like the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Nissan Altima. "The Taurus had the segment lead for eight years," he said, referencing a model that has grown in recent iterations into the full-size segment. "We've been there before."
With the Fusion having been introduced at the 2012 Detroit auto show in January, the appearance of the car in Times Square was relatively pro forma. Most of the attention after the presentation was trained on Mr. Mulally and his thoughts on the topics of the day.
Asked whether he supported the lawsuit expected to be brought by the Obama administration against China at the World Trade Organization, alleging that Beijing subsidized its auto parts industries to the detriment of American manufacturing, Mr. Mulally was uncharacteristically direct.
"What we support is the W.T.O.," Mr. Mullaly said. "It's important that we all follow it. We are free traders; we follow the rules."
Mr. Mulally also was asked about the state of his employment at Ford. As previously reported in The Times, widely circulated reports suggest Mr. Mulally would be succeeded by Mark Fields, Ford Motor president of the Americas, when Mr. Mulally retired. Ford's board of directors adjourned last week from its monthly meeting without having decided a timetable, let alone the likelihood, of such a move.
"Please don't write me off yet," Mr. Mulally said on Tuesday. "I love it here."

HEADLINE: How Do the 47% Vote?

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Will those paying no federal income tax "vote for the president no matter what"? Probably not. A lot don't vote, and of those who do, many vote Republican. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney asserted that the 47 percent of Americans who had no federal income tax liability would "vote for the president no matter what."
Actually, a lot them don't vote, and of those who do, many vote Republican.
There is, unfortunately, no data linking federal income tax rates directly to voting behavior. But we do have some demographic information about those 47 percent (technically, 46 percent, if you're looking at the most recent year of data) of American households that don't pay federal income taxes, and we can use those demographics to make some educated guesses about how those people might vote.
About half of people who don't owe federal income tax owe nothing because their incomes are too low; that is, all of their income is exempted after they take the standard deduction and personal exemptions for taxpayers and their dependents. For the most part, these households make less than $30,000 a year.
In 2008, when voter turnout rates were at or around record highs, fewer than half (44.9 percent) of adults in households making less than $30,000 per year voted, according to Census Bureau data. And of those who did vote, a substantial chunk voted for John McCain, the Republican candidate: 25 percent of those making under $15,000, and 37 percent of those making $15,000 to $30,000.
What about the rest of households who don't pay federal income taxes?
This group generally doesn't pay federal income taxes because of various deductions and credits in the tax code, known as "tax expenditures."
According to the Tax Policy Center, about three-quarters of these remaining households pay no income tax because of tax expenditures that benefit older people and low-income working families with children.
Older Americans vote in very high numbers. In 2008, 70.2 percent of people over age 65 voted, according to the Census Bureau. And in that election, older voters supported John McCain over President Obama by an 8-percentage-point margin, with 53 percent voting for Mr. McCain. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll, conducted last week, showed likely voters in the same age group supporting Mr. Romney by a 15-point margin - even wider than the gap on Election Day 2008. 
It's probably fair to assume, then, that many of the people who don't pay federal taxes because they're benefiting from expenditures aimed at older Americans will vote for Mr. Romney, not Mr. Obama.
Those benefiting from tax provisions for low-income working families with children are, by definition, poor, and as we've established, poor people lean strongly Democratic but they don't vote in very high numbers.
The remainder of the households that don't pay federal income taxes because of other miscellaneous tax expenditures (tax-exempt interest, itemized deductions, capital gains rates and so forth) are harder to pin down demographically, so it's challenging to make educated guesses about their likely voting behavior.
Mr. Romney also said that this "47 percent" of people who don't pay federal income taxes are the same people who are "dependent" on government services:
All right, there are 47 percent ... who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.
First of all, the nonpayers can't be conflated with the service receivers; people of all incomes and tax liabilities receive government services, not just those who have no federal income tax liability.
Are the people who do depend more heavily on government benefits at least more likely to vote Democratic, regardless of their tax burdens? Maybe those are the people Mr. Romney had intended to imply would vote for Mr. Obama "no matter what."
But as a portrait of the social safety net in The New York Times found last spring:
Support for Republican candidates, who generally promise to cut government spending, has increased since 1980 in states where the federal government spends more than it collects. The greater the dependence, the greater the support for Republican candidates.

HEADLINE: Media Feed Bias Against Latinos

BYLINE: LUISITA LOPEZ TORREGROSA


HIGHLIGHT: A newly released survey of Americans' attitudes toward Hispanics says prejudice against the country's fastest-growing minority is perpetuated by negative media portrayals. 

 BODY:
NEW YORK - As I write in my latest Female Factor column, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are making big moves in the final stretch of the presidential campaign to recruit and win over Hispanics. At the same time, a new national study shows that a large number of Americans, influenced by negative images in the media, take a dim view of Hispanics.
At least a third of non-Hispanic Americans - whites, blacks, Asians - mistakenly believe that half or more of the nation's 50 million Hispanics are illegal immigrants with large families and little education, according to the study, conducted earlier this year by the National Hispanic Media Coalition. (The United States has an estimated 10 million illegal immigrants, most of them from Mexico and Central America). The study shows that many Americans believe the media portrayals of Latinos, largely as maids, gardeners, dropouts, and criminals. 
The report, which involved some 900 respondents, could have far-reaching implications. The attitudes reflected in the study could further influence, or may have already influenced, the continuing debate in Congress over volatile issues like immigration, Hispanic/Latino identity, education, economic mobility, jobs - and not least, political power. 
The study upends the notion that prejudice and discrimination are mainly things of the past in this country. Biased and flawed information may affect many Americans' social and political decisions.
The poll also found that people who watch entertainment or news programs about Latinos that convey negative images hold the most unfavorable and hostile views, that negative portrayals of Latinos are common in the news and entertainment media, and that even those people most disposed to hold positive views about Hispanics are adversely influenced when exposed to negative media images. 
Releasing the study last week, the National Hispanic Media Coalition accused the U.S. media of fueling negative stereotypes. The media "influences the way of thinking about Latinos," said Alex Nogales, the president and chief executive of the NHMC, which commissioned the study by the independent firm Latino Decisions. He warned that his organization would renew requests, started in 2009 but so far unanswered, for federal agencies to investigate hate speech in the media. 
"This is a tough one," Marisola Pe, a Democrat and Cuban-Puerto Rican lawyer from Arlington, Virginia, said after reading an article on the report. "This is caused by lack of information, stereotypes, and complete ignorance of the richness and diversity of the Ibero-American culture," she said in a terse email message. 
Unlike Ms. Pe, Jose I. Jimenez, a Miami entrepreneur and Republican-Libertarian, examined the study and had plenty to say. "My first question is why do we lump Latinos into a group? Brazilians and Chileans couldn't be more different. Puerto Ricans and Mexicans are very different." And, of course, there are differences among Mexicans and Puerto Ricans and Cubans and so on. 
He was touching on a sensitive point for many Latinos who believe they are not all the same, that the umbrella term "Latino" or "Hispanic" is not one-size-fits-all. Still, that is how the fastest-growing and largest minority in this country has been branded. 
"Most Americans' perception of Latinos is based on the Mexican stereotype because Mexicans make up 60 percent of the Latino population in the United States," he noted. "So when I hear about this study, I think it means how Americans perceive Mexicans. If the question were, 'What is your perception of Argentines or Chileans?'' the answer might be different."
Mr. Jimenez, 50, a college-educated and upper-middle-class son of Cuban exiles, complained that "many in the media feel compelled to patronize Latinos in the news." And the media's focus on illegal immigrants, he said, often leaves the impression that most Latinos are here illegally. 
"When you look at Cubans the story is radically different,'' he said. "Yet the government lumps Cubans in the Latino pool and is giving the same benefits to them and addressing the community in the same when the dynamics are totally different."
He was making the point that the NHMC study, by grouping all Latinos under one umbrella, perhaps was itself operating from a general view that all Latinos are the same. And so, he suggested, the study may have missed the more complicated and diverse situations of Hispanic-American people in the United States.
That is just one of the questions raised by that study. There are similar and broader questions around the globe regarding immigration and minorities. Negative views of racial, ethnic and religious immigrant groups are not unusual in European, Latin American and Asian countries. The struggle for tolerance, acceptance and social integration seems to know few boundaries. 
 From your perspective, which groups are most stereotyped in countries outside the United States? Do other countries have the same kind of thorough research identifying stereotyping of minority groups? Does that kind of research help to combat prejudice? Does it help strengthen coexistence with more mutual understanding? How do you think the rapidly expanding share of Hispanics in the overall U.S. population will affect the future of the United States in the next 10 to 20 years?
Please share your thoughts.

HEADLINE: The Social Cost of Carbon: How to Do the Math?

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: A new study contends that the federal government's formula for calculating the social costs of fossil fuel emissions fails to factor in a range of negative impacts. 

 BODY:
This year's presidential campaign has shown that a gulf exists between the two candidates on America's energy future -- at least in theory. 
Mitt Romney opposes renewal of the federal wind energy tax credit and champions the exploitation of fossil fuels. President Obama advocates an "all of the above" strategy on energy but -- after a period of silence on the issue -- implicitly evoked the dangers of runaway emissions at the Democratic convention by warning that climate change is indeed a threat. 
But Mr. Obama's acceptance speech did not address what many researchers and policy analysis regard as the crux of the debate: How much are we as a society willing to pay today to prevent the climate-related costs of carbon dioxide emissions in the future? 
In 2010, 12 government agencies working in conjunction with economists, lawyers and scientists, agreed to work out what they considered a coherent standard for establishing the social cost of carbon. The idea was that, in calculating the costs and benefits of pending policies and regulations, the Department of Transportation could not assume that a ton of emitted carbon dioxide imposed a $2 cost on society while the Environmental Protection Agency plugged 10 times that amount into its equations. 
Instead, they decided, all of the agencies would use the same baseline of $21 per ton as the standard in monetizing the social costs of the seven-plus billion tons of carbon generated by American power plants, vehicles and factories each year. 
But a new paper published in the Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences concludes that the costs of carbon pollution and related climate change are vastly greater -- possibly two to 12 times as much. The problem, the authors argue, is that the federal government is not adequately taking into account the impacts of climate change on future generations.

At the heart of this debate is a disagreement about how to apply an economic concept known as the discount rate to the impacts of climate change. Simply put, the rate is based on how much it is worth to us now to prevent that future damage. Given that people are more concerned about having money now, economists posit that we are willing to spend less than a dollar today to prevent a dollar's worth of damage in a year, or two years, or a generation. 
A bird in the hand today is worth more than a bird in the hand tomorrow. Or perhaps two birds in the hand next week -- it all depends on the discount rate. Or, if you will, the discount rate helps to explain why a new college graduate borrows money from their anticipated future salary to live on while they are working their way up and why it's so hard for people to forgo eating a doughnut today in the hope of losing five pounds by the end of the month. 
The interagency group looked at discount rates of 2.5, 3 and 5 percent, ultimately settling on 3 percent and putting the cost of one ton of carbon at $21. But the new study opts for discount rates of 1, 1.5 and 2 percent, ultimately putting the cost of one ton of carbon at anywhere from $55 to $266. 
The research was carried out by Laurie Johnson, chief economist in the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council and Chris Hope of the University of Cambridge's Judge Business School.
Some economists have justified using higher discount rates because they expect that people in the future will have relatively more money and so be less affected by the damages. Every dollar spent mitigating climate change is also a dollar that cannot be invested in something else which could potentially have much higher returns in the future, they argue. 
But Dr. Johnson contends that the discount rate needs to be lower because climate change has the potential to severely disrupt projected economic growth. Even if income does rise over all, the people most harmed by climate change may not be experiencing the same rate of economic growth -- a factor that she says bears significant consideration. And carbon pollution has a host of "external" negative impacts like public health damage that she says must also be factored in.
"Looking at discount rates for climate change is especially tricky because unlike other situations, the people benefiting from current consumption are not the same people, not even the same generation or nationality, as those who will be most harmed," Dr. Johnson said in an interview. 
Michael Greenstone, a former chief economist for the president's Council of Economic Advisers who helped create the $21 price tag back in 2010, said he stands by the 2010 analysis.
"I'm not overwhelmed by the opinions of two people, experts as they may be, about what the proper assumptions are, not compared to the collective effort of a dozen federal agencies and leading experts from the wide variety of disciplines that have insight into the climate change problem," Dr. Greenstone said. "Calculating the social cost of carbon requires many, many assumptions."
"What the authors of this study are highlighting is that as you change those assumptions, you can make the number go up or down," he said. "There are other people that believe the discount rate should be even higher, which would lead to a substantially smaller social cost of carbon." he said. 
Frank Partnoy, a professor of law and finance at the University of San Diego, had a different take. "The governmental working group used a very empirically based discount rate, which seems very concrete, but over the long term runs into an ethical brick wall," he said. 
"A human life is often estimated to be worth around $10 million," he said. "But if you apply a three percent discount rate to this, that means that a human life five hundred years from now is only worth $3.81 today," 
"Ultimately, we can't rely on only numbers -- we have to make really hard value judgements," Dr. Partnoy said. "We should stop pretending this is a science and admit it is an art and talk about this in terms of ethics and fairness, not what we can observe in the markets."

HEADLINE: Dust-Up Over Ad in Kentucky House Race Featuring Executive Dressed as Miner

BYLINE: JOHN ELIGON


HIGHLIGHT: The man dressed as a miner in the ad for Republican Andy Barr is a coal company executive who has contributed thousands of dollars to politicians, mostly Republicans, and has rubbed shoulders with the likes of Mitt Romney at fund-raising events. 

 BODY:
The man wearing a hard hat and jean overalls draped over a neon green T-shirt has his arms folded and stares sternly into the camera. Standing on a graveled railroad track, he speaks bluntly of the decline of the coal industry as images of Ravenna, Ky., flash across the screen. The blame, he says, is with President Obama, Representative Ben Chandler, a Democrat from Kentucky, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
This latest television ad from Andy Barr, the Lexington lawyer running as a Republican to unseat Mr. Chandler, has drawn sharp criticism from the incumbent - in large part because the man dressed as a coal miner is a coal company executive who has contributed thousands of dollars to politicians, mostly Republicans, and has rubbed shoulders with the likes of Mitt Romney and Karl Rove at fund-raising events. The executive, Heath Lovell, vice president of River View Coal, does not live in Ravenna or anywhere in the district Mr. Barr is running for.
"His ad is not only shamefully deceptive, but it's an insult to hard-working Kentucky coal miners who put their lives on the line every day to power our communities and our economy," Eric Nagy, Mr. Chandler's campaign manager, said in a statement. "Ben Chandler has a long history of fighting to protect coal jobs and ensure the safety of coal miners, and Barr should be ashamed to use a corporate shill to suggest otherwise."
Mr. Lovell and Mr. Barr's campaign pushed back forcefully, saying that Mr. Lovell started working in coal mines as a teenager and worked his way up to become an executive. Mr. Lovell said his father and grandfather worked in coal mines. He still goes into the mine he manages every week, Mr. Lovell said. 
"That was my hard hat in the video," he said. "That was not some costume that I've put on."
David Host, a spokesman for Mr. Barr, said the idea for the ad was conceived during a jobs tour in the spring in which residents of Ravenna told the candidate that their town was once a thriving railroad hub that transported coal, but much of that industry has since vanished. Mr. Barr has blamed that on what his campaign describes as burdensome regulations put in place by the Environmental Protection Agency, backed by Mr. Obama and Mr. Chandler.
Even though Mr. Lovell was not from the area, he was speaking of problems the coal industry faces statewide that he sees firsthand, Mr. Host said.
"What he has to say accurately reflects the sentiments of miners in his mine and across Kentucky, about the war on coal," Mr. Host said. "They're concerned about their future, about their jobs. That certainly is something that the ad brings across."
Mr. Chandler's campaign argues that he has been an important ally of the mining industry, advocating for the safety and rights of miners and speaking out against overreaching regulations.
In the ad, Mr. Lovell stands in front of another man dressed in miner's clothing.
"Devastating," he says. "Four, five, six a day. Northbound. Southbound. Full rails, full of coal. Now near nothing." He goes on to say that Mr. Obama, Mr. Chandler and the E.P.A. "are destroying us."
"They're putting the coal industry out of business, and it's just devastating," he adds. "This is our way of life."
Mr. Lovell and his wife, Lori, have donated $21,400 to candidates for federal office over the past two years including to Mr. Romney and Rand Paul. Mr. Lovell was at a fund-raiser at the home of the founder of Papa John's Pizza, according to pictures on his wife's Facebook page, one of which showed him making a pizza with Mr. Romney.
"Heath and Mitt Romney," Mr. Lovell's wife wrote about the picture. "I am pretty sure this was the greatest day of Heath's life!"

HEADLINE: Obama, on Letterman Show, Responds to Romney Comments

BYLINE: BILL CARTER


HIGHLIGHT: The president told the "Late Show" audience that Mr. Romney was "writing off a big chunk of the country." 

 BODY:
President Obama got his first chance to address the firestorm over Mitt Romney's comments about 47 percent of the electorate being victims who don't have a sense of personal responsibility Tuesday night in a scheduled appearance on David Letterman's late-night show on CBS.
Mr. Obama said that Mr. Romney was wrong to categorize nearly half of Americans as people who saw themselves as victims and that he was "writing off a big chunk of the country" by his statement, which was made at a fund-raiser last May.
Mr. Letterman did note that Mr. Obama made a similar gaffe in the 2008 campaign when he was caught on tape saying that voters in Pennsylvania retreated to their "guns and their religion." Mr. Obama told Mr. Letterman that he had recognized that as a mistake and quickly apologized for it.
He also emphasized that he had sought to reassure the 47 percent of Americans who voted for John McCain in 2008 that he would be their president as well.
The two men also addressed the economy - Mr. Letterman said he still wanted to blame somebody and asked whether it could be Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. - and the recent attacks on American diplomatic personnel and property in the Middle East.
Mr. Obama, who was the only guest on Tuesday's "Late Show With David Letterman," received an enthusiastic greeting from the Letterman audience, who gave him a standing ovation as he walked onto the stage. 
Mr. Letterman got an immediate laugh by noting the empty spot next to the president and asking: "Is there anything you want to say to the empty chair?" (That of course referred to Clint Eastwood's speech at the Republican convention, when he spoke to an imaginary Mr. Obama in an empty chair.)
Mr. Obama got a big laugh as well after a discussion of how much in shape each man looked. Mr. Letterman said, "You haven't seen me naked."
Mr. Obama said, "We're going to keep it that way."

HEADLINE: Our Revolting Elites

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: What does it say about our culture that the people funding presidential campaigns seem to regard their downscale fellow countrymen as a kind of alien race? 

 BODY:
Were Mitt Romney's now-famous comments at a fundraising dinner in May - in which he appeared to write off 47 percent of Americans as self-pitying freeloaders with no self-respect - a window into the elusive "real Romney" and proof that his moderate-seeming faade has always been a sham?
Who could possibly know? Romney has built his career, in business and in politics, on telling people what they want to hear in order to persuade them to let him manage their affairs. This is a man who tried to get to the left of Ted Kennedy in their 1994 Senate race and to the right of Rick Perry in 2012. The idea that he would reveal his true political beliefs to a group of people he's trying to flatter, cajole and spook into giving him more money may be appealing to his critics, but it isn't necessarily convincing.
What these comments definitely tell us, though, is what Mitt Romney, master consultant, feels his "clients" in the Republican donor base want to be told about this election and what will inspire them to dig deep and give freely to his cause. Assuming those instincts are correct, his comments help illuminate the way many well-off Americans feel about their less-fortunate fellow countrymen - and it isn't a pretty thing to see.
As many people have pointed out, Romney's comments are a right-wing echo to what was previously the most famous leak from a fundraising event: Barack Obama's remarks in San Francisco in April 2008, when he characterized working class voters who were resistant to his charms as "bitter" people who "cling to guns or religion" and scapegoat immigrants because the economy has let them down.
In both cases, a presidential candidate was speaking about poorer people to a room full of rich people; in both cases, he was pandering to those rich people's fearful stereotypes about a way of life that they don't understand or share.
For rich Republicans, the stereotype is all about the money: They have it, other Americans don't, and those resentful, entitled others might just have enough votes to wage class warfare and redistribute the donors' hard-earned millions to the indolent and irresponsible.
For rich Democrats, the stereotype is all about the culture wars: They think they've built an enlightened society, liberated from archaic beliefs and antique hang-ups, and yet these Jesus freaks in flyover country are mobilizing to restore the patriarchy.
Both groups of donors seem to be haunted by dystopian scenarios in which the masses rise up and tear down everything the upper class has built. For Republicans, the dystopia is (inevitably) "Atlas Shrugged." For liberals, it's one part "Turner Diaries," one part "Handmaid's Tale."
The way Obama and Romney employed these stereotypes are not actually equivalent. Both behind-closed-door comments were profoundly condescending, but only Romney explicitly wrote off the people he's describing. As Slate's William Saletan notes, Obama embedded his bitter- clingers characterization in a longer riff about why it's important for Democrats to keep fighting for blue-collar votes. Romney's remarks were more dismissive and therefore should prove more politically damaging: "I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives," he said, of millions of his fellow countrymen, and left it at that.
But set aside the short-term politics for a moment. What does it say about our culture that the people funding presidential campaigns on both sides of the aisle seem to regard their downscale fellow countrymen as a kind of alien race, to be feared and condescended to in equal measure?
What does it say that rich Republicans are unable to entertain the possibility that Americans who depend on government programs during the worst recession in generations might have legitimate economic grievances?
What does it say that rich Democrats can't fathom why working class Americans might look askance at an elite that's presided over a long slow social breakdown and often regards their fundamental religious convictions as obstacles to progress?
What does it say that our politicians, in settings where they're at least pretending to open up and reveal their true perspective, feel comfortable embracing the most self-serving elite stereotypes about ordinary citizens who vote for the other party?
Nothing good, I think. The current American story is one of polarization, with the two major parties sealed into their respective ideological bunkers, and stratification, with an elite that's more isolated from the common life of the country it rules than at any time in recent history.
Both the right and left have provocative intellectual takes on how this new world came to be: Charles Murray's "Coming Apart" and Chris Hayes's "Twilight of the Elites," respectively, are this year's prime examples. But both takes are longer on description than prescription, and neither has much purchase on our politics.
However one tells the story, it's an increasingly unhappy one. Yet on the evidence of what our leaders and would-be leaders say when we're not supposed to be listening, there's nobody in either party who cares enough to do anything to change it.

HEADLINE: Beyonc and Jay-Z Host Obama Fund-Raiser

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: Beyonc&#233;, President Obama said, was a role model to his girls, while he felt a sense of kinship with Jay-Z because "we both have daughters and our wives are more popular than we are." 

 BODY:
On a day when Mitt Romney's videotaped remarks at a Republican fund-raiser dominated the campaign, President Obama attended two fund-raisers of his own in New York City, one hosted by the music super-couple Beyonc Knowles and Jay-Z.
Mr. Obama did not address Mr. Romney's comments during the small portion of each event that reporters were allowed to cover, though he did speak about them earlier in the evening, when he taped an episode of CBS's "The Late Show with David Letterman."
"My expectation is, if you want to be president, you've got to work for everybody, not just for some," Mr. Obama said to applause. Later, he added, "What I think people want to make sure of is, you're not writing off a big chunk of the country."
As is its usual practice, the Obama campaign allowed the White House press corps access only to Mr. Obama's introductory remarks, escorting reporters from the room before donors were able to ask questions of the president. During that brief period, Mr. Obama stuck to the script he generally uses with high-dollar donors.
"I don't want people to be complacent, but I also don't want people to be discouraged," the president said to a fashionable crowd of about 100, seated on sofas, according to a pool report.
"We're on the brink of an election, but more importantly, we're on the brink of moving America in a direction where we're going to be more just, more fair," he said at the 40/40 Club in Manhattan, where Jay-Z is an owner. "The economy's going to grow in a way that includes everybody, an America that's respected around the world because we're putting forward our best values and out best ideals."
Ms. Knowles, who sang at Mr. Obama's inauguration in 2009, kept her remarks brief in introducing him. "I can't tell you how proud we are to host tonight's event with President Obama," she said. "We believe in his vision."
When he took the stage, Mr. Obama said, "To Jay and Bey, thank you for your friendship." He said his wife, Michelle, and daughters, Malia and Sasha, were annoyed that he got to spend the evening with the glittery couple. Beyonc, he said, was a role model to his girls, while Mr. Obama said he felt a sense of kinship with Jay-Z because, he said, "we both have daughters and our wives are more popular than we are."
Mr. Obama has attended his share of celebrity fund-raisers, from one at George Clooney's home in Los Angeles to an event at the Atlanta mansion of Tyler Perry, with Oprah Winfrey on hand. But this fund-raiser had some memorable touches, including a tower of 350 Champagne bottles by Armand de Brignac, Jay-Z's favorite. Tickets cost $40,000.
At an earlier fundraiser with 200 donors at the Waldorf-Astoria - tickets starting at $12,500 per family - Mr. Obama said of the Republicans, "These people have super PAC's that are writing $10 million checks and are going to bury us under advertising like you've never seen before. We can't match these people dollar for dollar."

HEADLINE: Suicide Bomber in Afghanistan Strikes Minibus, Killing Mostly Foreign Workers

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND and SANGAR RAHIMI; Reporting was contributed by Alissa J. Rubin, Matthew Rosenberg and Jawad Sukhanyar from Kabul, and Scott Sayare from Paris.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- A suicide bomber killed 14 people on Tuesday, including 10 foreigners, most of whom worked as flight crew members under contract with the United States government, officials said. The attack brought to at least 28 the number of deaths attributed to unrest sweeping the Muslim world as a result of a video parodying the Prophet Muhammad.
A spokesman for an Afghan insurgent group, Hezb-i-Islami, claimed responsibility for the bombing and said it was carried out by an 18-year-old woman ''in response to the film insulting the Prophet Muhammad and Islam.'' 
The attack took place as word emerged that the American-led military coalition fighting the insurgents had sharply curtailed ground-level operations with the Afghan Army and police forces. The new limits were prompted by a spike in attacks on international troops by Afghan soldiers and police officers over the past six weeks. There was also fear that anger over the anti-Islam video could prompt such attacks, American officials said.
The deaths in Kabul on Tuesday were the first here so far connected to the video, and came as the authorities cracked down on attempted street demonstrations and asked Internet providers to block sites hosting a clip of the film, posted under the name ''Innocence of Muslims,'' shutting down access to Google, YouTube and Gmail in the process.
Access to Google and Gmail in Afghanistan appeared to have been restored by Monday afternoon, though officials said YouTube remained blocked for most Internet users. Google, which owns YouTube, declined a White House request to remove the video, saying it did not violate Google's rules on hate speech. In Egypt, a radical cleric issued a fatwa calling for the killing of everyone involved in the video, according to a report posted on militants' Web sites.
In the attack on Tuesday, the suicide bomber drove a car full of explosives at high speed head-on into a minibus carrying foreign workers on Airport Road, killing all 12 people aboard and two people on the road, according to the police.
The United States Embassy said in a statement that many of the foreign victims were employees of a private company that provides services to the United States Agency for International Development and other organizations in Afghanistan. American officials said they had been employed by a South African aviation charter company, ACS/Balmoral, working under contract for USAID as pilots and crew flying planes in what is colloquially known as ''Embassy Air'' to provincial capitals in Afghanistan.
A spokeswoman for ACS/Balmoral, Candice Teubes, said the 10 foreign victims were all believed to be South African citizens.
The authorities in Afghanistan provided conflicting accounts. An aide to Gen. Mohammad Ayoub Salangi, the Kabul police chief, said at least six of the 10 dead foreigners were South Africans, five men and a woman; one was a Filipino; and the nationalities of the others were uncertain.
At least 28 people have been killed in six countries as a consequence of protests over the video since it was posted on YouTube in the days before Sept. 11. A Florida pastor, Terry Jones, whose small church had publicly staged burnings of the Koran last year, called attention to it in the United States, but it drew much wider scrutiny in the Muslim world after an Arabic language version began to circulate on the Web.
The film was produced in the United States, though its origins are still shrouded. American federal authorities identified the man behind the film as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, 55. Though the film does not appear to violate any American laws, the authorities took Mr. Nakoula in for questioning on Saturday over possible federal parole violations connected to an unrelated criminal conviction. That action has done little to tamp down the unrest.
The violence began on Sept. 11 when a mob attacked the American embassy in Cairo. The unrest quickly spread to Libya, where an attack on an American diplomatic mission in Benghazi claimed the lives of the American ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, and three staff members. Protests at Western diplomatic posts in the ensuing days took one life in Egypt, three in Tunisia, one in Lebanon and five in Yemen. The United States sent Marines to Yemen and Sudan to protect embassies there.
SITE Intelligence Group, a monitoring agency that tracks militants' Internet postings, reported late Monday that a prominent Egyptian Salafist preacher, Ahmad Ashoush, had issued a fatwa, or religious edict, saying that ''the killing of the director, producer, actors and everyone else involved in the film is mandatory.''
The fatwa was posted on militant online forums on Sunday, SITE said.
The branch of Hezb-i-Islami that claimed responsibility for the Kabul bombing is an extremist faction headed by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, which fights against both the Taliban and the Afghan government. A moderate branch of the group has prominent members in the government, and Hezb-i-Islami has been seen as the insurgent group most likely to enter peace talks with the government.
The explosion took place on a road leading from the civilian entrance to the airport toward northern Kabul, near three adjacent wedding halls. The victims' vehicle appeared to have been heading toward the airport.
A street vendor, Abdul Rahim, 40, who was 150 yards from the scene, said he saw the suicide bomber drive into the minibus on a narrow access lane that was part of Airport Road, a broad boulevard where the lanes are separated by concrete barriers. As the vehicles collided, the bomb went off with such force that both were flung into the air, ending up 100 yards away from each another, he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Falls 12%, Aided by Cheaper Oil Imports

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States' current account trade deficit decreased 12.1 percent in the April through June quarter, pushed lower by an increase in American exports and cheaper oil imports. 
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that the current account deficit totaled $117.4 billion in the second quarter. That compares with a revised deficit of $133.6 billion in the first quarter, the largest in three years.
The current account is the broadest measure of trade. It tracks the sale of merchandise and services between nations and investment flows. Economists watch the current account as a sign of how much the United States needs to borrow from foreigners.
Many economists predict it will widen in coming quarters. A global slowdown has damped demand for American exports. And oil prices are rising again, in part because of increased tensions in the Middle East.
The debt crisis in Europe has pushed much of the region into recession. Europe accounts for about one-fifth of American export sales. And growth has slowed in other major export markets, including China, India and Brazil.
The current account deficit hit a record high of $800.6 billion in 2006. It then shrank after a deep recession reduced American demand for foreign goods by a greater amount than American export sales were damped. The trade gap began widening again in June 2009 when the recession ended.
In the second quarter, the deficit in goods sold shrank to $185.8 billion, from $194.3 billion in the first quarter. American exports rose 1.4 percent to $394.1 billion. Sales of farm products, led by a sharp rise in exports of soybeans, drove exports higher. Imports fell 0.5 percent to $579.9 billion, reflecting a drop in petroleum imports.
The American surplus in services increased 1.3 percent to $46.5 billion. The gain was a result of stronger American overseas sales of financial, business and professional services and higher royalties to American companies.
The surplus in investment income increased 0.8 percent to $184.6 billion in the second quarter, reflecting higher interest and dividend payments earned by American investors on their overseas holdings.

HEADLINE: Gambling Industry Money Is Streaming Into Albany

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
As Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo seeks legislative and public support for an expansion of the number of casinos in New York State, the gambling industry is pouring millions of dollars into lobbying state lawmakers and donating to their campaign funds.
Indian tribes, racetrack casinos and other gambling interests have spent nearly $50 million on lobbying and campaign contributions in the state since 2005, according to a new analysis by a government-reform group, Common Cause New York. 
And there is no end in sight: the industry is on pace to spend more this year than ever before, according to the report, which will be released on Wednesday. Gambling interests spent nearly $4 million on lobbying and more than $700,000 on campaign contributions in the first half of 2012, records show.
The surge in spending comes as the Cuomo administration and the Legislature are discussing how and where to allow new casinos. There are currently five casinos run by Indian tribes and nine so-called racinos at racetracks where electronic gambling is permitted, but table games with dealers are banned.
The Legislature has been discussing issues affecting horse racing and racinos for years. And this year, it began the process of amending the State Constitution to allow up to seven new full-scale, privately owned casinos, potentially worth billions of dollars to developers. For the amendment to become law, the legislators taking office in January must give it the green light, and then voters must approve it.
Mr. Cuomo supports the new casinos because of the likelihood that they would generate significant tax revenue and jobs. But the governor and lawmakers have not yet embarked upon the politically volatile task of deciding where the new casinos would be or who would run them, creating an opening for gambling concerns to step up their efforts to win influence in the state capital.
''It's just like a feeding frenzy,'' said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York. ''More than any other industry, almost, you have hundreds of millions and billions of dollars riding on specific decisions by the Legislature and the governor. And that's why you see so much money being invested.''
Common Cause conducted its analysis by examining lobbying and campaign-finance disclosures that were filed with the State Joint Commission on Public Ethics and the State Board of Elections. Ms. Lerner pointed to the spending as an indication that the Legislature should put in place a system to finance state elections publicly and lower the contribution limits for campaign donations.
Paul Davies, a fellow at the Institute for American Values who edits an antigambling blog, predicted that as the amendment process continued, opponents of expanded gambling in New York State would be unable to compete financially with the industry.
''Those guys will outspend any efforts, if there is even any organized or disorganized effort on the other side, by large margins to influence opinion,'' he said.
In recent years, the gambling industry's contributions have gone to a variety of officeholders. The industry has donated nearly $4 million to candidates for the Senate and the Assembly and to the legislative caucuses in both houses.
But Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has been the largest individual recipient of the industry contributions. Since 2007, he has received $716,000 in campaign donations from the industry and those tied to it, according to the Common Cause analysis. (Those donations account for a small fraction of the governor's overall fund-raising; as of July, his campaign account had a balance of more than $19 million.)
A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said Tuesday that the contributions did not affect the governor's position. ''No contribution, no matter the amount, has any influence on the operations of this administration -- period,'' the spokesman, Richard Azzopardi, wrote in an e-mail.
The spending has come from a variety of constituencies in the gambling industry, many of them with competing interests. The racinos, which hope to expand into full-fledged casinos, have represented the largest portion of the industry's spending in recent years: $16.5 million since 2005.
Other gambling companies, including many that want a piece of the state's gambling marketplace, have spent $10.5 million. And Indian tribes, some of whom already operate casinos in the state and are not eager for more competition, have spent $9.6 million. The balance of the spending has come from horse-racing and off-track-betting interests.
The largest spender, according to the analysis, was the Oneida Indian Nation, which operates the Turning Stone casino in central New York and spent $3.5 million on lobbying and campaign contributions. An Oneida spokesman, Dan Smith, said Tuesday that the nation's dealings with Albany included a number of subjects, not just gambling.
''We are absolutely going to fight for policies that we believe will help create jobs and improve New York State's economy,'' Mr. Smith said.

LENGTH: 777 words

HEADLINE: David B. Henry

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Henry, 63, is the vice chairman, chief executive and president of the Kimco Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust based in New Hyde Park, N.Y., that owns and operates nearly 930 neighborhood and community shopping centers in North and South America, totaling 136 million square feet.
Interview conducted and condensed by 
VIVIAN MARINO
Q. How is business?
A. The whole industry is improving step by step, slowly and steadily. And since consumer spending is 70 percent of the economy, and the economy is still very soft, it's a gradual improvement.
But our tenants in general -- retailers -- are healthier. Their balance sheets are stronger; they've learned to live with lower levels of inventory and they've cut their operating expenses where they can. So the national retailers in general are in much better financial shape than they have been in years and committed to resuming their store-count expansion. In addition, you've got the country growing at three million a year, and all those people need dry cleaners or Dunkin' Donuts.
Q. How many new projects or deals are you working on these days?
A. In the last year and a half we bought about 40 shopping centers and we sold about 60. The ones that we bought were bigger than the ones we sold, so net-net we're growing.
Capitalization rates for the good stuff are 6 percent, and in some places in the high 5 percent.
Q. Has the proliferation of online shopping sites affected business?
A. There certainly has been an effect. It's not quite as scary as it was a couple of years ago, because most of the national retailers have found a way to integrate their e-commerce divisions with their brick-and-mortar divisions and enhance their sales by having an Internet strategy and a store strategy. And there are certainly services like dry cleaning or barber shops that you could never do online.
Q. Are your tenants, though, leasing less space?
A. There are challenges to our industry in general. One is the fact that e-commerce is growing faster than regular sales. Secondly, you do have smaller store prototypes -- they may want to renew but in a smaller space, so we may have to subdivide.
The third challenge is local stores -- mom-and-pops simply don't have the credit that they're used to. So we continue to see the signs of that in our portfolio. As an example, our bigger stores over 10,000 square feet are 96 percent leased. Under that level it's in the 80s.
Q. What percentage of your portfolio is made up of mom-and-pop stores?
A. It's very small. Less than 15 percent of our income comes from the small guys. The true mom-and-pops are probably less than 10 percent.
National retailers or franchisees are increasing market share because of credit restriction with mom-and-pops. Your local bookshops are going away, and so are coffee shops.
Q. Who is your biggest tenant?
A. Home Depot is our biggest tenant, but no tenant is more than 3 percent of our income.
Q. You were named C.E.O. of Kimco in late 2009, a year after becoming the president. What changes have you made since taking the helm?
A. Part of these changes are a direct result of the recession. As an example, we used to be a merchant builder. We used to do a lot of development activities; we scaled that back. We used to have a lending business where we lent money to shopping-center owners and developers. We're no longer in the lending business.
We're concentrating on very simple equity ownership: long-term neighborhood and community shopping centers. So we simplified our business model. We also acquired some nonretail assets -- we had some senior living assets, office buildings and hotels -- and we gradually sold off our non-shopping-center assets. We started with $1.2 billion nonretail assets and it's down to a little less than $500 million.
Q. How did Kimco fare during the recession?
A. Market rents in 2009 dropped 25 to 30 percent, and perhaps we recovered a third of that. But rents are still down from peak levels.
Q. What is your average rental rate?
A. Our average rent is about $12 a foot, which I would argue is considerably lower than market rents because many of those leases are older leases. So if you wanted a guess, I'd say the national average for rents is $20-ish a foot.
Larger tenants generally pay lower rent per foot, so if you're a local dry cleaner in Long Island you may pay $40 or $50 a foot, and a big grocery store would pay $20.
Q. Do you like to shop?
A. Like most men, I would say no.
Q. Do you have any predictions for the holiday season?
A. We think it's going to be O.K., subject to macro events. There are lots of global events to worry about.

HEADLINE: Christie's Budget Faulted as Fiscal Outlook Is Called Weak

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey rose to stardom in the national Republican Party by promoting himself as a fiscal conservative willing to make the ''hard choices'' to restore sound budgeting to his state.
But for much of the last year, Democrats and independent budget analysts have argued that his current budget was built on wishful thinking, and assumed that the state's lagging economy would grow faster than that of almost anywhere else in the nation. In his typical blunt style, Mr. Christie dismissed those doubters as ''rooting for failure.''
On Tuesday, his frequent assertions of a ''New Jersey Comeback'' came under fresh scrutiny, this time from Standard & Poor's, which downgraded the state's financial outlook to negative from stable. 
The ratings agency said it lowered its outlook because it believed the governor's revenue projections for the current fiscal year were overly optimistic, warning that the budget was structurally unsound. In particular, the agency took note of the administration's reliance on one-time transfers of money to fill gaps in the state's $32 billion budget. At the same time, it noted that the state will have to spend more in the coming years to meet pension and Medicaid obligations.
The Christie administration quickly disputed the assessment, but the analysis was seized on by critics. ''We all want a successful New Jersey, but if we're to achieve it, we need to work with reality, not the administration's fairy-tale budgeting,'' Vincent Prieto, a Democrat from Hudson County and chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee, said Tuesday.
Standard & Poor's affirmed its rating of AA-- on the state's general obligation debt and A+ on the state's appropriation debt, but the lowering of the outlook indicates a likelihood that those ratings will be downgraded in the next two years.
The assessment comes a week after the state's nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services reported that revenue for the fiscal year that ended in June fell $254 million short of what the governor had anticipated, with a particularly large decline -- 9 percent -- in corporate tax revenue. The state's unemployment rate has risen to 9.8 percent, higher than all but those of California, Nevada and Rhode Island.
Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, the two other big ratings agencies, have also recently warned that revenues would lag behind the governor's expectations, which would require significant revisions to this year's spending plan because state law requires a balanced budget. Moody's warned that the revenue shortfalls ''leave the state exposed to a midyear structural imbalance.''
The governor's office directed questions to the state treasury. Andrew Pratt, a treasury spokesman, issued a statement playing down the revised outlook and emphasizing instead that Standard & Poor's, along with Moody's and Fitch, had for now affirmed the state's credit ratings.
''We believe investors will find S.&P.'s arguments to be out of step, and its basis for revising New Jersey's outlook unconvincing, particularly in the face of the continued growth in New Jersey's economy and state revenues,'' Mr. Pratt said.
He declined to detail how the administration found fault with the Standard & Poor's assessment.
When Mr. Christie issued his budget in February, he anticipated revenue growth of $31.9 billion, a 7.3 percent increase. It was the second-most optimistic projection in the nation, behind that of California, according to numbers compiled by the National Governors Association, and more than double the 2.9 percent increase in revenue over the previous year.
The budget included $500 million in one-time transfers from various accounts to fill holes in the budget and borrowed $260 million to pay for transportation projects that Mr. Christie had pledged to pay for in cash.
At the same time Mr. Christie pushed for a 10 percent across-the-board tax cut. Democrats, who control the State Legislature, passed a budget that granted the governor's tax cut only if his revenue projections came in on target at the end of the year.
In March and again in May, the director of the Office of Legislative Services, David J. Rosen, warned that revenues were lagging. Mr. Christie dismissed him as ''the Dr. Kevorkian of the numbers'' and accused him of working on behalf of Democrats.
Mr. Christie, who continued to press for the tax cut Tuesday at a town-hall-style meeting in Elmwood Park, appears to have jettisoned the phrase ''New Jersey Comeback.'' He declined to use it last month during his keynote address to the Republican National Convention. And for town hall meetings, he has adopted a new slogan: ''Christie Middle Class Reform Agenda.''

HEADLINE: Oil and FedEx's Forecast Weigh Down Markets

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks ended flat to slightly lower on Tuesday after the economic bellwether FedEx cut its profit forecast.
Falling oil prices weighed on the market for a second day, with the S.& P. 500 energy index falling 0.7 percent and leading the list of the S.& P.'s declining market sectors. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index remains up 5.3 percent since the end of July. The benchmark index reached levels not seen in nearly five years last Friday, a day after the Federal Reserve disclosed a plan for a third round of economic stimulus. The Fed's announcement followed the European Central Bank's statement that it would buy bonds to support struggling euro zone economies.
Shares of FedEx fell 3.1 percent to $86.55. The Dow Jones transportation average lost 1.1 percent. FedEx cut its profit forecast for its fiscal year 2013, saying that a weakening world economy had prompted customers to shift toward cheaper shipping.
Estimates for the third-quarter profits of S.& P. 500 companies have fallen sharply in recent months, and earnings are expected to decline 2.2 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would be the first such decline in three years.
Apple, which broke sales records with its new smartphone, provided some support to the market. Apple's stock set another high at $702.33 before ending at $701.91, up 0.3 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 11.54 points, or 0.09 percent, closing at 13,564.64. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.87 points, or 0.13 percent, to finish at 1,459.32. The Nasdaq composite index edged down 0.87 of a point, or 0.03 percent, to 3,177.80.
In the tech sector, shares of Advanced Micro Devices, a maker of chips for personal computers, tumbled 9.7 percent to $3.62 a day after the company said its chief financial officer was leaving. The PHLX semiconductor index lost 0.4 percent.
Economic data offered a fresh sign of momentum for the housing market. Homebuilder sentiment rose for the fifth month in a row in September to its highest level in more than six years, the National Association of Home Builders said. The PHLX housing sector index, however, was down 0.8 percent.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 9/32, to 98 10/32, and the yield fell to 1.81 percent from 1.84 percent late Monday.
Commodities slumped for a second day as economic problems in the United States and Europe made investors cautious about the demand outlook for oil, metals and crops. In the euro zone, pressure grew on Spain to request aid and test a European Central Bank bond-buying program. The dollar jumped against the euro, weighing on commodities priced in dollars.
Crude oil fell nearly 2 percent, down more than 4 percent this week after Monday's heavy liquidation.

HEADLINE: Rising Tower Emerges As a Billionaires' Haven

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
One57, a 1,004-foot tower under construction in Midtown Manhattan, will soon hold the title of New York's tallest building with residences. But without fanfare from its ultraprivate future residents, it is cementing a new title: the global billionaires' club.
The buyers of the nine full-floor apartments near the top that have sold so far -- among them two duplexes under contract for more than $90 million each -- are all billionaires, Gary Barnett, the president of the Extell Development Company, the building's developer, said this week. The other seven apartments ranged in price from $45 million to $50 million.
The billionaires' club includes several Americans, at least two buyers from China, a Canadian, a Nigerian and a Briton, according to Mr. Barnett and brokers who have sold apartments in the building, at 157 West 57th Street. Mr. Barnett said that at least a few buyers were ''significant Forbes billionaires.'' 
Since late last year, the ''trophy'' end of New York's real estate market has been recording eye-popping sales that seem to have little basis in reality. The signed contract for the nearly-11,000-square-foot duplex on the 89th and 90th floors of One57 that sold for about $95 million topped the record sale in March of a penthouse at 15 Central Park West to a Russian billionaire's daughter for $88 million. In June, Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas casino magnate, paid $70 million for a duplex penthouse apartment above the Ritz-Carlton.
Individual sales aside, it is the sheer concentration of wealth in One57, a $1.5 billion development, that is raising the eyebrows of some longtime market watchers.
''The scale of wealth in this building is just unheard of,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a property appraiser. ''Despite all the problems economically, you are seeing these people invest in real estate unlike in any period that has ever happened.''
Since sales began in the building in November, Extell has signed contracts for more than $1 billion worth of apartments, about $300 million just this summer, Mr. Barnett said. Fewer than 40 of the 92 apartments remain unsold, among them four full-floor units. But Mr. Barnett said two potential buyers from China were ''circling'' one of them.
The cost of entry into the club now exceeds $50 million for the remaining full-floor apartments, Mr. Barnett said.
Last week, after Extell provided a reporter with an exclusive look at the 360-degree views that the owners of the full-floor apartments will experience when they are able to move in late next year, it was not hard to understand the appeal of One57.
The construction elevator took six minutes to ascend 850 feet to an apartment on the 85th floor. (It will take 30 seconds for the residents' three elevators to reach the top, Extell officials said.) The 6,240-square-foot apartment was bought by an American who already owned ''some of the best real estate in the world,'' including two ''very significant'' places in New York, said Nikki Field, the Sotheby's International Realty broker who represented the buyer.
For now, the apartment is just bare walls and concrete. Orange netting hangs in place of what will be floor-to-ceiling windows.
The building seems almost centered along the south end of Central Park. From the apartment's main living room, the park seems to roll out like a giant green carpet. On a clear day, you can see all the way to the Bronx. To the east, planes can be seen taking off from La Guardia and Kennedy Airports. The Atlantic Ocean pokes out over the horizon. To the northwest, the gentle bend in the Hudson River is visible. Closer in, you can see the grassy terrace of the $88 million penthouse at 15 Central Park West.
To the south, a resident standing in what will be a bathroom with his-and-hers showers and toilets will look out on the Empire State Building, the World Trade Center complex and the Statue of Liberty, not to mention the electronic billboards in Times Square.
Mr. Barnett spent 15 years assembling the property and air rights on 57th Street. At first, he said, he just wanted to build a 300,000-square-foot building. ''I didn't even think in terms of views,'' he said. ''But as the assemblage got larger and the market started rising to new levels, and views of the park became so paramount, the project took shape.''
When the property market sank after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, Mr. Barnett had to persuade his partners to stay the course. ''Partly it was a belief that the market would come back and it was the right thing to go forward,'' he said, ''and partly I had no choice. You have a site, and there is no way to get out of it but to go forward.''
In the end, his timing was lucky. As New York has emerged from the downturn, high-end real estate has become a magnet for the world's superrich, who are looking for better investment returns and a safe haven from thornier economic conditions in their home countries.
Ms. Field said Mr. Barnett ''was there in January when there was no other product and people were looking for a place to stash their cash.''
''A lot of what is happening at One57 is about wealth preservation,'' she added.
Even some owners at 15 Central Park West, with its star-studded resident roster and rave architectural reviews, are buying into One57. At least three have signed contracts to buy units there, Ms. Field said.
One57 has at least a two-year head start on newer developments vying for the billionaire set, like 432 Park Avenue, which is expected to be almost 400 feet taller than One57 when it is completed in 2016.
The steady sales have allowed Mr. Barnett to turn away a few potential buyers when negotiations have gotten sticky. There was Nick Candy, a developer of another billionaire enclave, One Hyde Park in London. Negotiations broke down after Mr. Barnett refused to give Mr. Candy the right to flip an apartment before construction was completed, according to e-mails between the men. Mr. Barnett also decided not to sell to Michael Hirtenstein, a millionaire entrepreneur, after Mr. Hirtenstein paid a One57 construction worker to shoot a video that he said revealed that his view on the 47th floor would be partly blocked by the neighboring Essex House sign. And Mr. Barnett said he passed up a full-floor sale to a potential buyer who wanted to do major renovation without allowing Extell to assist in the construction and ease the inconvenience for other residents.
''I can't tell you I would be so principled if I was having a hard time selling,'' Mr. Barnett said. ''We are not desperate to sell at all costs.''

HEADLINE: When It Comes to Filmmaking, Yonkers Seeks a Bigger Part

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
YONKERS -- When it came time to make the movie based on the Neil Simon play ''Lost in Yonkers,'' the director bypassed the actual city and filmed it mostly in Ohio. But that setback, some 20 years ago, has not deterred officials from claiming that Yonkers is ready for its close-up.
The latest pitch on the city's behalf was made in Yonkers Stage, a glamour-free warehouse where Russell Crowe and Colin Farrell are expected to be shooting scenes in a couple of months. Those stars were nowhere to be seen, but Mayor Michael Spano was on hand to announce that the Westchester County city had waived its usual permit fees for filming there. 
Though the fees are small -- $300 to $500 -- Mr. Spano said that waiving them would demonstrate how serious the city's revived Office of Film and Photography was about trying to draw production crews away from New York City and smaller towns in the metropolitan area. While he spoke, carpenters behind him built benches for a stage for the movie ''Winter's Tale,'' based on the novel by Mark Helprin.
As countless elected officials east of Hollywood have done before him, Mr. Spano said he believed his city had the right stuff to serve as a setting for films, television shows and commercials. ''Yonkers is actually a pretty sought-after place for companies to come to,'' he said.
He said production companies had shot in the city on more than 60 days already this year, up from just 35 days in 2012. That activity, he said, should yield benefits to the city's economy as the crews spent money there on food, gas and equipment.
But as the activity around him proved, leading crews to Yonkers does not necessarily translate into getting them to shop there. The mayor had barely finished speaking when a panel truck filled with plywood backed into the warehouse.
Where, the workers were asked, was the wood for the sets bought? Queens, they said.
The carpenters had not yet figured out how to construct a reasonable facsimile of the Brooklyn Bridge, said Roger Paradiso, one of the operators of the soundstage. But he said the building, just off the New York State Thruway and less than a half-hour's drive from Manhattan, had passed for a New York City landmark before.
In 1998, he said, John McTiernan, the director of a remake of ''The Thomas Crown Affair,'' decided to film many of that movie's scenes at the Yonkers Stage, instead of using a soundstage in the former Homeport Naval Station on Staten Island. Gesturing toward the vast open space to his left, Mr. Paradiso said, ''This was the Impressionist wing of the Metropolitan Museum.'' Officials at the Met were unamused by the depiction of the theft of a painting from their august institution, he said, so they refused to allow the cameras inside.
Mr. Paradiso noted that in ''Thomas Crown,'' Pierce Brosnan can be seen reaching for the door of the museum, but he never opens it, because that bit was filmed on a Monday, when the Met was closed.
Since then, he said, several films have been shot in Yonkers. The films, which include ''I Am Legend,'' Doubt'' and ''Maid in Manhattan,'' encompass big-budget Warner Brothers spectacles and independent productions -- even a documentary made by Mr. Paradiso himself about the early hip-hop group the Sugarhill Gang.
Speaking frankly, Mr. Paradiso said directors chose to shoot there because ''it's cheaper,'' had ample parking and was ''not as frenetic as Manhattan or Queens.''
But he admitted that establishing a place as an alternative to the big city can involve luck as much as good intentions. Had Mr. McTiernan not preferred an old storage space in Yonkers to a newly rebuilt stage on Staten Island, he said, ''none of this would have happened.''
''It was serendipity,'' he said with a shrug.

HEADLINE: Classif ying Calories

BYLINE: By MARTIN BRUEGEL. 
Martin Bruegel, a historian at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research, is the editor of ''A Cultural History of Food in the Age of Empire.''

 BODY:
Ivry-sur-Seine, France
STARTING this week, McDonald's is posting calorie information for all items on its menus across the United States, part of a movement to improve diets and reduce obesity by providing nutritional data. New York City has mandated that chain restaurant s post calories since 2008, and the federal health care law adopted in 2010 will eventually require fast-food restaurants across the United States to do so. < TXT>
While the alarm over obesity is fairly recent, the notion of using ''scientific'' knowledge to guide the dietary habits of ordinary people -- part icularly the less well off -- is not. The fate of earlier campaigns suggests tha t it will take much more than calorie information to change food ways. 
Nut ritional recommendations were born at the end of the 19th century with the disco very that humans need 20 calories per pound of weight each day; 55 to 65 percent of this energy intake ought to come from carbohydrates, a quarter from fats and something over 10 percent from proteins.
These guidelines did not emerge only from scientific inquiry but also from a desire to maximize efficiency. In 1 888, the American chemist Wilbur O. Atwater devised a series of formulas that wo uld help people get the most energy from the least food. Economics and physiolog y would be joined in what he called ''the pecuniary economy of food.'' Atwater p ioneered a movement that came to be known as ''scientific eating.''
The not ion appealed to French physicians, who had been looking for ways to improve work ing-class health and budgets. They believed that these households spent too much on meat and alcohol. Their program of ''rational eating'' aimed to instruct the poor to keep food expenses within the limits of their (modest) budgets. They ur ged the substitution of protein-rich legumes for red meat, pasta for sausages, a nd sugared beverages for wine.
These reformers believed that ignorance was the problem and information the solution. Nutrition facts were put next to the i tems on the menu cards in factory canteens and in working-class restaurants. Sca les at the entrance to eating places helped customers to monitor their weight. A menu board, listing carefully calibrated culinary options, would allow workers to assemble nutritious meals from a set of limited options.
The program flo pped -- except in prisons, where lower calorie supply per inmate induced savings -- as French workers continued to enjoy their sausage and wine. It did manage, though, to raise eyebrows in the United States. ''If Paris does not know how to eat,'' a Chicago newspaper asked in 1912, under the headline ''Pessimism in Pari s,'' ''who would?''
Yet Americans embraced the fad. In 1914 the New York S tate Board of Health introduced a ''scientific restaurant,'' where staff luncheo ns were made according to ''the most modern dietary theories.'' Restaurants acro ss the country began to list energy and protein content on their menus.
Ch ilds Restaurants, an ancestor of today's global fast-food chains, provided ''a c omplete lesson in dietetics, mathematics, food conservation, patience, economy, and patriotism and a meal thrown in for good'' to its clientele. The demands of World War I made efficiency even more imperative. (Some thought the calorie coun ting went too far; The New York Tribune bemoaned the ''mystery cult of the calor ie.'')
By 1920, Americans were so calorie conscious that a romance novel, Ethel M. Kelley's ''Outside Inn,'' featured calories as a prominent theme. In 19 24, the Restaurant Owners' Association toyed with providing diners with printed advice on well-balanced meals ''from the point of view of calories.''
None of these initiatives lasted. For European and American consumers, hearty and pa latable meals outweighed scientific formulas every time.
The history of ''s cientific eating'' offers several lessons. Nutritional campaigns can succeed in influencing consumer behavior only if they take into account the sensual joys of eating. The French continued to eat their red meat and drink their red wine bec ause rich meals gave them a sense of belonging to a community. Similarly, Americ an consumers after World War II saw access to plentiful, ever cheaper and ever l ess healthy foods as proof of the American promise -- even if the impact on thei r waistlines, and well-being, has been disastrous.
In an era of stagnant w ages, dystopian politics and cultural anomie, eating indulgent if unhealthful fo od has become a last redoubt of enjoyment for Americans who don't feel they have much control in their lives.
Higher incomes and better educations -- in t he classroom, not on the menu board -- will do more to solve the obesity epidemi c than mandating the disclosure of calorie counts. Before we blame the poor and the overweight for their inability to manage their budgets or control their appe tites, we might want to think not only about the foods they encounter in the sup ermarket and on television but about a culture that relies ever more on unhealth y foods to breathe meaning and purpose into everyday life.

HEADLINE: Behind Goldman Sachs's Success, a Focus on Survival
<AUT >Steven M. Davidoff is a professor of law and finance at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twit ter.

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF

 BODY:
It wasn't long ago that Goldman Sachs was pa inted as an outsize villain of the financial crisis, and its future seemed hazy. Today, however, Goldman Sachs has retained its clients and its dominance. And r ecent missteps by its competitors are putting the investment bank in pole positi on to profit when a recovery comes.
It's not here yet. The investment banking business is in a miserable state. According to Dealogic, worldwide revenue for the investment banking industry was down 26 percent in the first half of 2012 fr om the same period a year ago.
Goldman, too, is suffering in thi s downturn, but it has held its investment banking pre-eminence. In the first ha lf of 2012, according to Dealogic, Goldman Sachs ranked third among banks in dom estic and global equity capital markets rankings. In the league tables for globa l advice on mergers and acquisitions, Goldman was No. 1 worldwide and in the Uni ted States. 
Over all, according to Dealogic, the firm had $1.7 billion in i nvestment banking revenue for the first half of 2012 and was third in the global rankings. This is a feat since the firm doesn't have the lending capability of JPMorgan Chase, No. 1 in the global rankings, or Bank of America Merrill Lynch, No. 2.
As for sales and trading, traditionally the heart of the banks' reve nue, Goldman's institutional client services segment had $9.6 billion in net rev enue in the first half of this year - down about 5 percent from the previous yea r. But compare this with Morgan Stanley, where sales and trading revenue was $4. 4 billion, down more than 32 percent.
The numbers show that despite content ions that Goldman had traded against its clients by shorting the housing markets , clients have not fled. And some of Goldman's competitors have changed or made missteps in ways that will help the bank in the future.
JPMorgan, for one, has been hurt by the billions in trading losses out of its chief investment offi ce unit. The bank's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has to confront the likelihood of significantly increased oversight by regulators.
Another big competitor , Barclays, has been bogged down by an interest rate manipulation scandal that f orced an upheaval in its executive ranks. It, too, will also face increased regu latory oversight, not to mention litigation.
Citigroup is sorting out wheth er it wants to be a consumer bank or an investment bank or something in between as it tries to achieve a turnaround. But the bank clearly no longer has aspirati ons to be the global supermarket that its former chief executive, Sanford I. Wei ll, hoped for it to be. Where Citigroup's investment banking division fits in th is puzzle is still unknown, probably even to the bank's executives.
The vis ion in the late 1990s was that a bank could offer both commercial and investment banking services and that it could leverage its ability to lend billions of dol lars to gain investment banking business. The recent troubles of the big banks s uggest that this dream is over.
Any benefits from being both a commercial l ender and an investment bank are outweighed by huge regulatory hurdles. The army of regulators and compliance officers required to oversee the operations of the se banks is an increasing drain on their ability to make money.
Goldman has taken steps to heal itself from self-inflicted wounds. In the uproar after the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs formed a business standards committee to examine practices and recommend change. The committee put forth 39 recommendations to i mprove governance and client relations. In response, the firm has fundamentally realigned its business segments. Goldman has also overhauled its board, revised its public relations strategy and put in place stronger clawback policies.
The firm has also made every effort to move past financial crisis allegations. I t paid $550 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission accusations tha t it misled investors in a mortgage-related security. Recently the Justice Depar tment announced that it would not pursue charges related to accusations that Gol dman shorted the housing market while selling products to clients betting the op posite.
The financial crisis has also forced Morgan Stanley - long Goldman' s main rival in investment banking - to change its business model substantially. Morgan Stanley has struggled with its smaller capital base and an undiversified business. To solve this problem, it recently reached an agreement to acquire th e entire Smith Barney brokerage operations. But that means that Morgan Stanley m ay become more of an asset manager than an investment bank. And the controversy over the Facebook initial public offering is not likely to have helped Morgan St anley, which led the offering and has been vying with Goldman to underwrite othe r hot technology I.P.O.'s.
As a result, Goldman is becoming the last pure-p lay, big investment bank. In a world where business consultants preach that a fo cus on your best business lines is necessary to success, Goldman is likely to ha ve an advantage over the banking conglomerates.
And instead of diversifying , Goldman is taking steps to retain its focus. Goldman did not spin off its priv ate equity arm, GS Capital Partners, to comply with the Volcker Rule. Instead, i t kept the operation in-house by financing it through outside money rather than Goldman's. Other banks have also retained their private equity arms, but Goldman 's was always the biggest and it faced the most pressure to divest. Keeping GS C apital Partners will maintain the firms' edge in playing a part in takeover deal s.
Still, it's not going to be an easy ride for the bank. Goldman will cont inue to be a flash point and a target as a symbol for the financial crisis and g reed in general. Moreover, Greg Smith, the former Goldman employee who publicly resigned through an opinion article in The New York Times, has a memoir coming o ut this fall called "Why I Left Goldman Sachs."
It may again send Goldman i nto damage control mode. But if the firm's clients haven't left already, why wou ld they now? Goldman is more regulated now than before the financial crisis, but it seems as if it will not face prosecution for any of its activities, and its competitors are having more problems with regulators. Mr. Smith's book is unlike ly to change anything.
The stock market agrees. Goldman's stock price is up about 25 percent this year, beating out JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup.
Investment banking may be down, but it will eventually return. And the rem arkable story will be that Goldman, despite the controversies it has faced, has put itself in a position to not only profit but continue its dominance. It's a c ase study in business survival and reputational repair. The protesters at Occupy Wall Street will not be happy. But neither will Goldman's competitors.
Thi s is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Scores of Japanese S tores Close Over China Protests

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Scor es of Japanese-owned factories and stores in China were shuttered Tuesday as ant i-Japan demonstrations erupted in dozens of cities.
At stake are billions of dollars in investments and far more in sales and trade between Japan and China, the world's third- and second-largest economies, behind the United States. The t wo are so closely entwined that both would suffer from any long-term disruptions .
While the Chinese authorities appeared to be moving to clamp down on the protests, the Japanese government has been urging Beijing to do more to protect Japanese businesses from trespassing, looting and other damage, Osam u Fujimura, chief cabinet secretary, told reporters. 
''Japanese companies play an important role in the Chinese economy and employment. We believe we shou ld be calm and make rational judgments from a broad perspective,'' Mr. Fujimura said. Some private and government-level meetings and events have been postponed or canceled, he said.
Big name brands and retailers appeared to be sufferin g the brunt of the latest mass outburst of anti-Japanese sentiment, with compani es in lower profile sectors less affected.
Many companies said they closed Tuesday as the 81st anniversary of a Japanese invasion brought a fresh wave of protests venting anger over the colonial past and a current dispute involving co ntested islands in the East China Sea.
Pain from the protests was being fe lt in Tokyo, too, where business has slowed for the many shopkeepers catering to Chinese tourists.
''It makes me wonder how Japan will emerge from this,'' Yui Watanabe, 20, said of the protests. ''We just really need to be level-heade d,'' she said.
In Shanghai, many of the Japanese-owned or oriented shops an d restaurants in the western part of the city where the Japanese consulate is lo cated had either closed or covered any Japan-brand signs.
Uniqlo, Asia's b iggest clothing retailer, had closed some of its outlets but opened its huge fla gship store on Shanghai's main Nanjing Road shopping street by the early afterno on. Amid calls for a boycott of Japanese products, the popular store was busy wi th shoppers.
Despite rancor over the territorial dispute, trade between th e two countries has been thriving. Total trade rose 14 percent to $344.9 billion in 2011, setting a record, according to the Japan External Trade Organization. Japanese help run China's high-speed train lines and aid from Tokyo helped build much of the country's modern infrastructure, including the Pudong international airport in Shanghai.
Still, many employees of Japanese retailers, automak ers and other companies were staying home Tuesday as thousands of anti-Japanese demonstrators marched in Beijing. The Japanese school in Beijing was closed on M onday, a Japanese public holiday, and on Tuesday. Staff said they were uncertain what would happen on Wednesday.
Many companies were wary of speaking in t oo much detail about the situation.
Toyota Motor would not reveal which or how many of its factories were closed, saying it was up to each affiliate or su bsidiary to decide. Employee safety was the priority, it said in a company state ment.
A Toyota dealership in Qingdao was burned and others had display mod els damaged, though there were no reports of injuries at the company's factories or dealerships.
Honda Motor said all five of its assembly plants in China were closed Tuesday and Wednesday, mainly to adjust production because of the i mpact of the anti-Japanese backlash on sales. Honda dealerships also have been d amaged in recent protests, the company said.
Honda's sales in China accoun t for about one-fifth of its global total, with Toyota's accounting for about 10 percent and Nissan Motor's for over one-quarter. Until recently, all three were outperforming their domestic rivals, despite a cooling in demand over the past two years.
Kobe Steel began shutting four of its various steel, aluminum a nd construction machinery plants in China starting Tuesday, with all four to be closed by Wednesday, said Gary Tsuchida, a spokesman.
''As a precautionary measure, we decided it would be better to cool things,'' he said.
Sharp, which gets about a fifth of its sales from China, said its various factories wer e operating as usual, with no impact so far on their production. However, Yuta O ga, a spokesman, said the company was taking precautions in having employees avo id unnecessary travel or excursions.
Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which has a big shipbuilding joint venture in the Yangtze River city of Nantong, near Shan ghai, has likewise continued business as usual.
Sony said it had suspended production at two factories out of the seven it operates in China, to protect i ts employees.
Although Chinese manufacturers are upgrading their technolog y and equipment as they close the gap with their global rivals, many rely heavil y on advanced robotic machinery and other Japanese technology, as well as state- of-the-art materials and components.
Halts to production caused by the Mar ch 2011 earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan had an especially heavy imp act on automakers. But the ripple effects of any major disruptions would be felt in many industries, from heavy manufacturing to clothing and cosmetics.

HEADLINE: Eli Lilly Tr ades Parking Lot for a Downtown Feel

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
INDIANAPOLIS -- Virtually since its founding in 1876, the drug maker Eli Lilly's stature as t his city's most prominent corporate resident has rarely been questioned. Still, it has been decades since the people who work at the company's headquarters have been offered a strong connection to the city's downtown, which has steadily dev eloped into one of the most engaging business, trade and entertainment destinati ons in the Midwest.
That could soon change.
Next month, the first two mixed-use retail and residential buildings will open at CityWay, a $15 5 million, 600,000-square-foot new urban neighborhood. CityWay is rising from 14 acres of land, owned by Lilly and used for years as a parking lot that separate d the company's corporate campus in southeast Indianapolis from Monument Circle, the core of downtown. 
With its eye-catching angles, colors and textures, and with trees and flower beds decorating sidewalks and new streets, the CityWay project certainly presents Indianapolis with a striking new standard for neighb orhood design in this city of 827,000, the nation's 12th-largest. And instead of facing an exposed and discouraging expanse of asphalt, the 5,500 employees at L illy's headquarters and the young researchers the company is busy recruiting and trying to retain will have an inviting neighborhood to stroll to.
''We're close to the center of Indianapolis but we haven't felt so close,'' said Steve Van Soelen, Lilly's director of strategic real estate, who helped develop the co ncept of CityWay. ''There was a lot of open space between us and the downtown co re.'' Because Lilly needed to find ways to attract young people ''who wanted to be part of an active urban place,'' he said, ''we decided that a new urban neigh borhood on the site made a lot of sense.''
In addition to these first two b uildings, the CityWay development will also include the Alexander, a $44 million , 209-room, 161,000-square-foot, four-star hotel scheduled to open in January; a third retail and residential building that is under construction and scheduled to open in January; and a 24,000-square-foot mixed-use office and retail buildin g that will start construction next March. The development's master plan encompa sses 40,000 square feet of street-level retail space, a $22 million, 75,000-squa re-foot Y.M.C.A. that is under development and two parking structures large enou gh to handle 750 vehicles.
The construction of CityWay represents a number of firsts for Lilly and for Indianapolis.
In pursuing the construction of a new neighborhood, Lilly took on planning, promotion, development and job reten tion responsibilities that until very recently were largely the purview of munic ipal governments. Another example of such company-led urban redevelopment is in downtown Las Vegas, where Tony Hsieh, the founder and chairman of Zappos.com, th e online shoe and apparel retailer, is spending $350 million to transform a dete riorated section of the city into a new headquarters, as well as an active resid ential and retail neighborhood for his young staff.
For its project, Lilly turned for help to the city and to Buckingham Companies, a local developer. May or Greg Ballard, a Republican elected last year to his second term, liked the id ea of CityWay and his economic development staff constructed a creative package of financing. The largest piece, awarded in the midst of the national real estat e recession, was a 10-year, $86 million construction loan, the first and largest loan of its type ever awarded by the city. According to Michael Huber, the form er deputy mayor for economic development who negotiated the financing package, t he state of Indiana also provided a $5 million loan. The Y.M.C.A. is investing $ 22 million. And the local tax increment financing district, or TIF, is investing $9 million, most of it to construct roads, decorative sidewalks and other infra structure. Lilly's 14 acres, which it is leasing to Buckingham, were valued at $ 14 million. Buckingham also invested $4 million.
''Lilly told the mayor the project is critical to their future success,'' said Mr. Huber. ''They were recr uiting talent, and they needed to do more to showcase the downtown. The big park ing lots were a psychological barrier.'' Consequently, he added, ''the mayor ins tructed us to find ways to get the project done.''
Critics in conservative Indianapolis have raised concerns about public investments in private projects, arguing that if the development was worthwhile the market alone would support th em. But city officials have made the case that public investments are needed to support specific facets of private projects, like street improvements and parkin g. The city's track record in supporting successful projects has made it possibl e to overcome local objections.
In fact, Indianapolis, which this year hos ted the Super Bowl in four-year-old, $720 million Lucas Oil Stadium, built large ly with public financing, has a strong record of using the city treasury to leve rage new development. Across town, Flaherty & Collins Properties, another local developer, is preparing to build an $85 million, 305,638-square-foot mixed-use b uilding with 500 apartments, a 42,000-square-foot grocery store and 15,000 squar e feet of retail space. The financing package includes a proposal, still in nego tiation, for $11 million in city financing to build a parking structure.
T he city's signature downtown walking mall and Bankers Life Fieldhouse, where the Indiana Pacers play, also were built with more than $100 million each in public financing, said Mr. Huber.
The result of these and other projects is a cit y that has gradually developed a regional brand as a livelier place to live and do business, in a state that is doing better economically than most. In June, In diana generated 10,700 new jobs, more than all but three other states, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Indianapolis's unemployment rate is 7.5 perc ent, below the state and national jobless rates.
Michael J. Fox, the presid ent of Buckingham's construction division, notes that the primary market for Cit yWay's apartments, hotel rooms and retail spaces are visitors to the city's spor ts arenas, and employees of Lilly and three other big corporate offices that are all within a 10-minute walk of the new neighborhood.
One of those companie s is Rolls-Royce, which consolidated six offices on Indianapolis's perimeter and late last year began moving 2,500 engineers and information technology employee s downtown into its largest operation outside Britain. The company leases two bu ildings, 440,000 square feet, that Lilly built a decade ago at a cost of about $ 75 million. They are so close to CityWay it's easy to envision Rolls-Royce staff walking over for morning coffee or a salad at lunchtime.
Mr. Fox said that all of the one- and two-bedroom apartments in the project's first two buildings had already been rented at prices ranging from $900 to $1,300 a month, and that there was a lengthy waiting list. The retail spaces have not been entirely leas ed but he expects them to be full by the end of the year. ''We see this as kind of a missing piece of the development that's been occurring here for years,'' sa id Mr. Fox. ''The interest we've already seen in the residential units, in hotel bookings -- it gives us confidence that it will be a welcome addition to our do wntown.''

HEADLINE: Replacement Officials Face Growing Criticis m

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
In a normal season, a group of N.F.L. referees taking a few minutes under the lights of ''Monday Night Football'' to figure out where a ball should be placed after a defensive holding penalty would be amusin g. But with replacement officials making scenes like that one too common and som etimes struggling with the rules of the game, the amusement has begun to fade.<P A>''Honestly, it's embarrassing,'' Mike Tirico, an ESPN announcer, said in the s econd quarter of Monday's game between Denver and Atlanta. ''The command and con trol of this game is gone.''
Two weeks into the regular season, with the N.F.L.'s lockout of its officials going strong, replacement officials h ave awarded a team an extra timeout in a close game, ruled multiple incomplete p asses as fumbles, missed an array of pass-interference and unnecessary-roughness calls, and in one game took six minutes to review a play that they subsequently determined was not reviewable. One referee was removed from the crew of a New O rleans Saints game after publicly proclaiming himself a Saints fan. 
In a r ecent radio interview, Philadelphia Eagles running back LeSean McCoy suggested t hat the replacements might be approaching the game as supporters rather than off icials. ''I'll be honest, they're like fans,'' McCoy said. ''One of the refs was talking about his fantasy team, like 'McCoy, come on, I need you for my fantasy .' ''
Jim Harbaugh, the coach of the San Francisco 49ers, was so exasperate d by the officiating in a Week 1 win over the Green Bay Packers that he threw a challenge flag and the broadcast crew speculated he had done so simply to give t he officiating crew a piece of his mind.
So far, however, the league is shr ugging off the criticism, issuing a statement after Sunday's games in support of the replacements.
''Officiating is never perfect,'' the statement said. '' The current officials have made great strides and are performing admirably under unprecedented scrutiny and great pressure. As we do every season, we will work to improve officiating and are confident that the game officials will show conti nued improvement.''
The situation has provided so much fodder for critics t hat the sports Web site Deadspin, with the help of readers on Twitter, has been compiling a list of the blunders, a process that is being called Scabwatch.
''Once is funny, like when Seattle gets a fourth timeout and can't even make ha y of it,'' said Drew Magary, a writer for Deadspin. ''But now the calls are so b ad that you really don't expect any play to be officiated properly. Ike Taylor g ot flagged for nothing on Sunday. It was insane.''
The sentiment through on e week of games was that even with a few bad calls, the officials had performed reasonably well over all.
Chris Kluwe, the outspoken punter of the Minneso ta Vikings, had been critical of the replacements in the preseason but defended them recently on Twitter, saying, ''The replacement refs did a good job at our g ame; couple missed calls but nothing egregious.''
In the second week, howev er, players brazenly exploited weaknesses they had discovered in the ways the ga mes were being called.
In one instance, Cortland Finnegan of the St. Louis Rams openly shoved Josh Morgan of Washington in an attempt to bait Morgan into r etaliating despite being in front of an official. When Morgan responded by throw ing the ball at Finnegan, he was immediately flagged. The penalty cost the Redsk ins a chance at a comeback.
''There's no doubt the integrity of the game h as been compromised by not having the regular officials out there,'' the Giants' Mathias Kiwanuka said Tuesday.
Taking advantage of the lack of judgment i s a process Magary says will continue as long as the replacements are on the fie ld.
''Why not? They're trying to win and preserve their employment,'' Magar y said. ''It's not their fault the N.F.L. has handed them this massive weakness to exploit.''
One issue the critics and the league disagree on is the effec t the replacements have on player safety.
Some have speculated that missed calls and players trying to take advantage of the replacements' inexperience cou ld lead to more injuries, a belief Greg Aiello, an N.F.L. spokesman, dismissed, pointing out there have been 75 safety-related calls through two weeks this seas on compared with 74 over the same period last season. He also says that the leag ue's system of fines helps to ensure player safety.
''It is longstanding po licy that players are subject to fine and/or suspension for an illegal hit even if a penalty was not called on the play,'' Aiello said in an e-mail. ''So player s know they are held accountable to the safety-related rules even if the game of ficials miss one, which has happened in previous seasons. We have seen no eviden ce that player safety is being compromised.''
Magary disagreed.
''You saw it last night,'' he said of the officiating during Monday's game between th e Broncos and the Falcons. ''You see how out of control it's getting. Someone wi ll get blinded at the bottom of a pile or get their jaw broken.''
With no m ovement reported toward a settlement, it appears Week 3 will also feature replac ement officials. And the criticism is likely to continue.

HEADLINE: In Buyback Deal, Alibaba Gets Half of Yahoo's Stake

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
8:14 p.m. | Updated
Yahoo closed on the sale o f half of its stake in the Alibaba Group of China, the company said Tuesday, giv ing it $3 billion to return to its shareholders.
Some investors had fretted that Yahoo would decide against doling proceeds from the sale to sha reholders, after the company's new chief executive, Marissa Mayer, said last mon th that she was "reviewing" its business strategy. To some, it suggested that Ms . Mayer, a former Google executive, was more keen to hold onto the money for som e other use, including acquisitions.
But it appears that Ms. Mayer has deci ded that a payout to investors, including the hedge fund manager and Yahoo board member Daniel S. Loeb, who holds about a 6 percent stake, was in the company's best interest. 
It has already spent $646 million on stock buybacks since Ma y, in what it called a "down payment" to its stockholders.
In selling about 20 percent of Alibaba's stock back to the company, Yahoo will reap about $7.6 b illion before taxes. The $3 billion represents about 85 percent of the net cash proceeds from the sale, with Yahoo also receiving preferred shares in its partne r.
The deal, struck in May, is part of a comprehensive agreement worked out between Alibaba and Yahoo, beginning the transformation of a partnership that h as often proved contentious.
The two companies' alliance began when Yahoo b ought a 40 percent stake in Alibaba in late 2005. But as Yahoo began to falter, falling behind newer rivals like Google and then Facebook, its stake in Alibaba leapt in value.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Yahoo's remaining stake in Alibaba was valued at about $8.1 billion, representing about 43 percent of the American company's $18.9 billion market value.
Over the last few years, both sides have engaged in on-again, off-again talks about the return of that stake.
U nder the terms of the agreement, Yahoo will sell half of its stake back now. It will sell an additional 10 percent of Alibaba when the Chinese Internet company files to go public in the next few years, and then divest the remainder sometime after that.
For Alibaba, Tuesday's announcement is the biggest step yet to ward its long-held goal of regaining full control of its future. Still privately held, it has taken a number of steps toward becoming publicly traded, including finally striking a deal with Yahoo.
Alibaba has spent the last several mon ths crisscrossing the world, raising the requisite financing for the stock buyba ck from investors like the China Investment Corporation, the Chinese private equ ity firms Boyu Capital and Citic Capital and the China Development Bank. Existin g investors like Silver Lake, DST Global and Temasek also participated.
And it arranged $2 billion in financing from a number of international banks.
"The completion of this transaction begins a new chapter in our relationship wit h Yahoo," Jack Ma, Alibaba's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "We are grateful for Yahoo's support of our growth over the past seven years, an d we are pleased to be able to deliver meaningful returns to our shareholders in cluding Yahoo."
Ms. Mayer said in a statement: "This yields a substantial r eturn for investors while retaining a meaningful amount of capital within the co mpany to invest in future growth."
This is a more complete version of the s tory than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Priest's Dip Into Politics Raises Outcry

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com; Twitter: @jimdwyernyt

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, the weekly bulletin at the Church of St. Catherine of Siena on the Upper East Side of Manhattan carried a blunt political message from a priest on the parish staff.
Which the priest, Rev. John A. Farren, took care to dissociate himself from.
''I am aware that I and no church authority may endorse candidates for political office,'' Father Farren wrote. 
You could practically see him winking.
Father Farren proceeded to turn over much of his page in the bulletin to a letter written by six former ambassadors to the Vatican who said they were supporting Mitt Romney for president because of his opposition to abortion, to marriage rights for same-sex couples and to aspects of the national health insurance law that require coverage of contraceptives.
''We urge our fellow Catholics, and indeed all people of good will to join with us in this full-hearted effort to elect Gov. Mitt Romney as the next President of the United States,'' concluded the Romney supporters.
As it happened, just as the weekly bulletin appeared in the pews at St. Catherine's, the head of the New York Archdiocese, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, was getting ready to head for Charlotte, N.C. There, he would give a prayer at the close of the Democratic National Convention, just as he had in Tampa, Fla., where Republicans met to formally select Mr. Romney as their nominee. It was a conspicuous display of even-handedness.
Father Farren was filling in for the parish's pastor, who was taking a break on Labor Day weekend. Normally, church bulletins do not become hot items. But more than 20,000 people signed a petition to Cardinal Dolan, objecting to Father Farren's endorsement-by-proxy. Though it was the voice of one priest, and not the institutional church, it opened a window onto a debate among Catholics about how they and the church engage with civil society. The church has made strong statements about economic justice for the poor, protection of immigrants, support of labor unions and objections to the death penalty, but those issues have largely been drowned out by advocacy against abortion and same-sex marriage.
''We have a responsibility to be engaged in the public debate,'' said James Salt, the leader of Catholics United, a group that supported the petition drive and that promotes what it views as the overlooked aspect of Catholic social justice doctrine. ''If the church wants to be a spiritual leadership in our culture, they can't be seen as the heirs of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell.''
The church bulletin was sent by a man who attended Mass at St. Catherine's to a group called Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service.
Tax-exempt organizations like churches are ''absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office,'' according to I.R.S. guidelines. This includes, according to the I.R.S., ''distributing statements prepared by others that favor or oppose any candidate for public office.''
The petitions from Catholics United were delivered to St. Patrick's Cathedral last week. ''I wouldn't comment beyond noting that archdiocesan policy is clear that our churches should not endorse candidates for office,'' said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese.
On Tuesday morning, about 25 people gathered for Mass at St. Catherine's. The church, an imposing presence that stretches from 68th Street to 69th Street, and is close to four major medical centers, was nearly empty. The least sound rose into vaulted ceilings, gathered force and carried to the most distant pew: a squeak of rubber soles, the clink of a coin dropped in an offering box.
At the rear of the church was a stack of fresh church bulletins, these carrying a note from the Rev. Jordan Kelly, the church pastor, about the letter.
''The reprinting of this letter was an unfortunate error in judgment,'' Father Kelly wrote. He regretted the confusion.
During the Mass, another priest, Juan-Diego Brunetta, prayed for ''the sick and dying in the hospitals all around us, especially those who will die this day.''
In one aisle, a hospital housekeeper, in a blue pinstriped dress, bowed her head. The Mass finished early enough for her and other hospital workers to get to work on time without politics, but with faith and reason braided into a rope to use while crossing the slippery deck of the day.

HEADLINE: FedEx Lowers Forecast, Citing Weak Economy

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
FedEx says the global economy is stalling and that the situation is likely to get worse next year.
Weak economic conditions are shrinking earnings at FedEx, the world's second-largest package delivery company after United Parcel Service. Factories are making fewer items for FedEx to ship and customers are choosing cheaper delivery options to save money.
FedEx cut its outlook for global growth and industrial production on Tuesday while reducing its forecast for company earnings, part of its statement of first-quarter results. The company's chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, suggested trade had slowed to levels seen in the last two significant economic downturns. The company's shares closed down more than 3 percent on Tuesday, at $86.55. 
The lower forecast on shipments indicates that the global economy has a way to go to a full recovery. Several countries in Europe are in recession and the United States is struggling with high unemployment and weak manufacturing growth. Mr. Smith said some experts had underestimated the severity of the slowdown in exports from China, where FedEx invested heavily over the last several years by adding new planes to export goods and by expanding its hubs and network.
FedEx's forecasts are closely watched for signals of future economic health. Its results provide insight into the global economy because of the number of products it ships and the number of countries in which it does business. Its rival U.P.S. said in July that it expected the global economy to get worse before it began to improve. U.P.S. also cut its earnings forecast.
The slow pace of economic recovery is hurting FedEx because it relies on sharp spurts of demand to feed its air network. Demand for airfreight is usually strong coming out of a period of slow economic growth because retailers have whittled their inventories and need to replenish quickly when demand picks up. The current recovery in the United States is the slowest since World War II.
FedEx lowered its expectations for American economic growth to 2.2 percent in 2012 and 1.9 percent next year. Those are mostly in line with economists' views.
FedEx, based in Memphis, cut its earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending next May to $6.20 to $6.60 a share, from a previous forecast of $6.90 to $7.40 a share.
For the current quarter that ends in November, FedEx forecast earnings of $1.30 to $1.45 a share, compared with $1.57 a share last year. That amount is well under analysts' forecasts. FedEx will get a lift from major technology product introductions, like the recently announced iPhone 5, but not enough to make up for the slowdown elsewhere.
The company also reported that its earnings fell 1 percent in its most recent quarter. In the three months that ended in August, FedEx earned $459 million, or $1.45 a share. That hit the top end of its recently lowered estimate. Revenue rose 3 percent to $10.79 billion. It earned $464 million, or $1.46 a share, on revenue of $10.52 billion in the fiscal first quarter a year earlier.
Economic growth around the globe has slowed over the last several months. Output has declined in Japan, China and elsewhere in Asia. American industrial production last month fell by the largest amount in more than three years, as factories produced fewer goods. Meanwhile, rising gas prices and high unemployment kept consumers from spending freely.

HEADLINE: Not the Old Middle East

BYLINE: By IAN BREMMER

 BODY:
President Obama created a stir last week -- in Washington, Cairo and across the Middle East -- when he described Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood-led government as neither an ally nor an enemy. The State Department later walked the comment back a bit, but the White House had delivered its message: We have no responsibility to fight this government or support it, and Egypt's new leaders need our money more than we need their good will.
By signaling that Washington will try to get what it wants not by spending more money but by threatening to withhold it, the White House has again made clear that it will not lunge into the latest Middle East turmoil but will continue to keep its distance. This trend toward less direct engagement is playing out across the region. 
In the Middle East, stability has for centuries been imposed, for better and for worse, by outsiders -- Europeans, Ottomans, Russians and Americans. But today, there are no foreigners willing and able to accept the costs and risks that come with this role. Americans are worried about jobs and debt -- and U.S. foreign policy has shifted focus toward Asia. Europeans are preoccupied with their continent's crisis of confidence. Russia lacks Soviet-scale international muscle, and the Chinese are worried about China -- its slowing economy and the dangers of domestic reform.
The latest wave of anti-American outrage across the Muslim world has only deepened this reluctance of outsiders to become more involved. Before he was ousted, Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, warned Washington many times over many years that the alternative to his authoritarian rule was a flow of radicals over the wall. Now there is a flood of wire service photographs of exactly that nightmare, and the murder of U.S. diplomats in Libya has given them a much more sinister frame. The fury has spread to Tunisia, Yemen, Sudan, Iraq and beyond.
The slaughter in Syria adds to the anxiety. No one outside Tehran and Moscow wants to bolster Bashar al-Assad, but the images of infuriated young men in Egypt, Libya and Yemen have given outsiders greater pause about Syria's fragmented, radicalized and increasingly well-armed opposition. That conflict will drag on without intervention by outsiders for some time to come.
In short, foreign governments are now less willing than ever to bet on either the devil they know or the one they don't. The result is that local powers will be left to sort things out. Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia -- three countries with very different political systems, social structures, worldviews and visions for the region -- will compete for influence.
For many in the Arab world, Turkey offers proof that a Muslim democracy can build a modern, dynamic economy with a relatively open society. Iran is the world's only theocracy, an international nuclear outlaw and a state sponsor of Shiite militancy. Saudi Arabia remains far more socially conservative than either of its influential neighbors and spends freely to promote its Wahhabi conception of Islam. The frictions produced by various forms of conflict among these three will shape the region for many years to come.
Turkey, which imports a large percentage of its energy from Iran, will try to keep troubled relations with the Islamic Republic on track, but Iran's fear that Turkey is undermining Assad's government in Syria, Iran's primary regional ally, and Ankara's suspicion that Tehran is supporting Kurdish militancy inside Turkey will keep things at a simmer. Turkey and Saudi Arabia have interests in common, particularly in limiting Iran's regional influence, but the two governments are marketing markedly different interpretations of modernity and Islam. The Saudi-Iranian rivalry is central to the region's potential for conflict -- in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and within Saudi and Iranian society.
Other states will play a significant role. Egypt's new government will continue to try to strike a delicate balance between appeasing street-level anger toward America and protecting a relationship with Washington that brings in about $1.3 billion a year in military aid. But President Mohamed Morsi has not proven he's up to the task, adding uncertainty for the United States, Israel and the rest of the region. Qatar's government will continue to spend money to extend its influence, particularly in Syria. Finally, though Israel is unlikely to launch strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities this year, the tensions generated by escalating rhetoric on both sides will keep governments and markets on edge.
Welcome to the new Middle East, where old assumptions must be questioned and new crises loom. Over the longer term, regional stability may well benefit as local governments, aware there are fewer constraints on their belligerence, will be forced to accept greater responsibility for provocative actions. But the road from here to there will lead through undiscovered country.

HEADLINE: Race Is On as Ice Melt Reveals Arctic Treasur es

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
NUUK, Greenland -- With Arctic ice melting at record pace, the world's superpowers are increasingly jockeying for political influence and economic position in outposts like this one, previously regarded as barren wastelands.
At stake are the Arctic's abundant supplies of oil, gas and minerals that are, thanks to climate change, becoming newly accessible alon g with increasingly navigable polar shipping shortcuts. This year, China has bec ome a far more aggressive player in this frigid field, experts say, provoking al arm among Western powers.
While the United States, Russia and se veral nations of the European Union have Arctic territory, China has none, and a s a result, has been deploying its wealth and diplomatic clout to secure toehold s in the region.
''The Arctic has risen rapidly on China's foreign policy agenda in the past two years,'' said Linda Jakobson, East Asia program director at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney, Australia. So, she sai d, the Chinese are exploring ''how they could get involved.'' 
In August, Ch ina sent its first ship across the Arctic to Europe and it is lobbying intensely for permanent observer status on the Arctic Council, the loose international bo dy of eight Arctic nations that develops policy for the region, arguing that it is a ''near Arctic state'' and proclaiming that the Arctic is ''the inherited we alth of all humankind,'' in the words of China's State Oceanic Administration. < PA> To promote the council bid and improve relations with Arctic nations, its m inisters visited Denmark, Sweden and Iceland this summer, offering lucrative tra de deals. High-level diplomats have also visited Greenland, where Chinese compan ies are investing in a developing mining industry, with proposals to import Chin ese work crews for construction.
Western nations have been particularly anx ious about Chinese overtures to this poor and sparsely populated island, a self- governing state within the Kingdom of Denmark, because the retreat of its ice ca p has unveiled coveted mineral deposits, including rare earth metals that are cr ucial for new technologies like cellphones and military guidance systems. A Euro pean Union vice president, Antonio Tajani, rushed here to Greenland's capital in June, offering hundreds of millions in development aid in exchange for guarante es that Greenland would not give China exclusive access to its rare earth metals , calling his trip ''raw mineral diplomacy.''
Greenland is close to North A merica, and home to the United States Air Force's northernmost base in Thule. At a conference last month, Thomas R. Nides, deputy secretary of state for managem ent and resources, said the Arctic was becoming ''a new frontier in our foreign policy.''
In the past 18 months, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea have made debut visits here, and Gree nland's prime minister, Kuupik Kleist, was welcomed by President Jos Manuel Bar roso of the European Commission in Brussels.
''We are treated so differentl y than just a few years ago,'' said Jens B. Frederiksen, Greenland's vice premie r, in his simple office here. ''We are aware that is because we now have somethi ng to offer, not because they've suddenly discovered that Inuit are nice people. ''
Chinese activity in the Arctic to some extent mirrors that of other non- Arctic countries, as the region warms.
The European Union, Japan and South Korea have also applied in the last three years for permanent observer status a t the Arctic Council, which would allow them to present their perspective, but n ot vote.
This once-obscure body, previously focused on issues like monitori ng Arctic animal populations, now has more substantive tasks, like defining futu re port fees and negotiating agreements on oil spill remediation. ''We've change d from a forum to a decision-making body,'' said Gustaf Lind, Arctic ambassador from Sweden and the council's current chairman.
But China sees its inclusi on ''as imperative so that it won't be shut out from decisions on minerals and s hipping,'' said Dr. Jakobson, who is also an Arctic researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. China's economy is heavily dependent on exports, and the polar route saves time, distance and money to and from elsewher e in Asia and Europe, compared with traversing the Suez Canal.
So far ther e has been little actual exploitation of Arctic resources. Greenland has only on e working mine, though more than 100 new sites are being mapped out. Here, as we ll as in Alaska, Canada and Norway, oil and gas companies are still largely expl oring, although experts estimate that more than 20 percent of the world's oil an d gas reserves are in the Arctic. Warmer weather has already extended the work s eason by a month in many locations, making access easier.
At one point thi s summer, 97 percent of the surface of Greenland's massive ice sheet was melting . At current rates, Arctic waters could be ice-free in summer by the end of the decade, scientists say.
''Things are happening much faster than what any s cientific model predicted,'' said Dr. Morten Rasch, who runs the Greenland Ecosy stem Monitoring program at Aarhus University in Denmark.
Ownership of the Arctic is governed by the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea, which gives Arctic nations an exclusive economic zone that extends 200 nautical miles from land, and to undersea resources farther away so long as they are on a cont inental shelf. The far northern Arctic Ocean belongs to no country, and conditio ns there are severe. In a place where exact boundaries were never much of a conc ern, haggling over borders has begun among the primary nations -- between Canada and Denmark, and the United States and Canada, for example.
The United Sta tes has been hampered in the current jockeying because the Senate has refused to ratify the Convention of the Law of the Sea, even though both the Bush and Obam a administrations have strongly supported doing so. This means the United States has not been able to formally stake out its underwater boundaries. ''We are bei ng left behind,'' Deputy Secretary Nides said.
But experts say boundary di sputes are likely to be rapidly resolved through negotiation, so that everyone c an get on with the business of making money. There is ''very little room for a r ace to grab territory, since most of the resources are in an area that is clearl y carved up already,'' said Kristofer Bergh, a researcher at the Stockholm Insti tute.
Even so, Arctic nations and NATO are building up military capabiliti es in the region, as a precaution. That has left China with little choice but to garner influence through a strategy that has worked well in Africa and Latin Am erica: investing and joining with local companies and financing good works to ea rn good will. Its scientists have become pillars of multinational Arctic researc h, and their icebreaker has been used in joint expeditions.
And Chinese co mpanies, some with close government ties, are investing heavily across the Arcti c. In Canada, Chinese firms have acquired interests in two oil companies that co uld afford them access to Arctic drilling. During a June visit to Iceland, Premi er Wen Jiabao of China signed a number of economic agreements, covering areas li ke geothermal energy and free trade.
In Greenland, large Chinese companies are financing the development of mines that are being developed around discover ies of gems or minerals by small prospecting companies, said Soren Meisling, hea d of the China desk at the Bech Bruun law firm in Copenhagen, which represents m any of them. A huge iron ore mine under development near Nuuk, for example, is o wned by a British company but financed in part by a Chinese steel maker.
C hinese mining companies have proved adept at working in challenging locales and have even proposed building runways for jumbo jets on the ice in Greenland's far north to fly out minerals until the ice melts enough for shipping.
''Ther e is already a sense of competition in the Arctic, and they think they can have first advantage,'' said Jingjing Su, a lawyer in Bech Bruun's China practice.<PA > The efforts have clear political backing. Greenland's minister for industry a nd mineral resources was greeted by Vice Premier Li Keqiang in China last Novemb er. A few months later, China's minister of land and resources, Xu Shaoshi, trav eled to Greenland to sign cooperation agreements.
Western analysts have wor ried that China could leverage its wealth, particularly in some of the cash-poor corners of the Arctic like Greenland and Iceland.
But Chinese officials h ave cast their motives in more generous terms. ''China's activities are for the purposes of regular environmental investigation and investment and have nothing to do with resource plundering and strategic control,'' the state-controlled Xin hua news agency wrote this year.
Michael Byers, a professor of politics an d law at the University of British Columbia, said the Chinese were unlikely to o verstep their rights in a region populated by NATO members. ''Despite the concer ns I have about Chinese foreign policy in other parts of the world, in the Arcti c it is behaving responsibly,'' he said. ''They just want to make money.''
Next February, the Arctic Council is scheduled to choose the countries that will be granted permanent observer status, which requires unanimity vote. Though Ice land, Denmark and Sweden now openly support China's bid, the United States State Department, contacted for comment, declined to say how it would vote.

HEADLINE: More Protests in China Over Japan and Islands$ %

BYLINE: By IAN JOHNSON and THOM SHANKER; Mia Li contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China drove home its opposition to Japanese control of a contested group of islands on Tuesday, with angry protests in dozens of cities and a warning from i ts defense minister that ''further actions'' were possible.
The protests were large and sometimes angry, but appeared much better controlled than those over the weekend, which included extensive rioting and vandalism. Many Japanese busin esses closed for the day, and a strong police presence seemed to prevent damage. 
The Japanese companies that closed included the 7-Eleven conven ience store chain, which is Japanese-owned in China. The company said it would r eopen Wednesday. Several other large companies, including Mitsubishi and Canon, gave their employees the day off.
Despite the calls for peaceful protests, scattered violence was reported. The Italian consul's car in Guangzhou was attac ked, according to diplomatic sources who asked to remain anonymous.
The pro tests occurred as Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta was visiting the country, an d early Wednesday Mr. Panetta met with the Chinese vice president, Xi Jinping, w ho is expected to become the nation's next leader. The meeting with Mr. Xi in th e Great Hall of the People was taken as evidence that Mr. Xi had recovered from whatever ailment, physical or political, had kept him from making public appeara nces for two weeks.
In the streets on Tuesday, the protesters were objectin g to Japan's control of a group of islands in the East China Sea called Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu or Diaoyutai in Chinese. Japan has held the islands for m ore than a century, but many Chinese believe they should have been given to Chin a after World War II.
In Beijing, several thousand people brought one of th e city's diplomatic districts to a standstill as they swelled out from a crucial artery, the Third Ring Road, to beyond the Japanese Embassy. The police kept pr otesters separated into groups of 100 to 200 each; at the peak of the demonstrat ion, in the early afternoon, streets were lined with at least 20 such groups. <P A> As the day progressed, crowds threw rocks and water bottles at the well-guar ded embassy compound. Some of the banners were crude, with sexual undertones tha t might have reflected the Japanese military's brutal wartime treatment of Chine se, including the systematic rape of Chinese women during its 14-year invasion a nd occupation of parts of the country. One banner showed a Chinese soldier castr ating a Japanese soldier, while a popular image depicted Japan's national flag a s a white sanitary napkin with a spot of blood in the middle.
Some foreign ers were queried about their nationality, with Americans lectured for their coun try's military alliance with Japan. Foreign men were asked if they had Chinese g irlfriends.
Although the protests clearly had government support -- large-s cale public demonstrations are extremely rare in China -- many people came on th eir own and appeared to be genuinely angered at what they saw as Japan's failure to address its past behavior.
Tuesday was the 81st anniversary of the Muk den Incident, which signaled the start of Japan's incursion into China and is so metimes referred to as the ''day of national humiliation.''
Zhang Dongxiao, a student at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said he and a few classmates took the subway to the protest site to express the ir anger.
''Japan must fear China,'' he said, predicting demonstrations eac h year on the anniversary unless Japan gives up its claim to the islands.
O ther protesters came from farther afield. Members of one group of about 40, from Badong County in Hebei Province, said that the county government had organized bus transportation but that the demonstrators had paid for it.
Some demons trators were supported by patriotic businesspeople who helped defray costs. A ma n from the city of Tangshan who gave only his surname, Guo, said he found a grou p through an online bulletin board and took a bus that a local businessman had c hartered.
More official pressure was also applied. A well-connected governm ent research institute, the Council for National Security Policy Studies, led by a retired general of the government's paramilitary force, said Japan should als o give up the Ryukyu island chain. That chain stretches from southern Japan to T aiwan, and many Chinese see it as encircling China.
The defense minister, G en. Liang Guanglie, used the visit by Mr. Panetta to issue a stern warning. Whil e holding open the possibility of a peaceful resolution to the dispute, he warne d that China reserved the right to undertake unspecified ''further actions.''<PA > General Liang said the islands ''have all along been China's inherent territo ry since ancient times, for which China has sufficient historical and jurisprude ntial evidence.''
He characterized Japanese actions toward the islands as i llegal. In recent weeks, the Japanese central government bought some of the isla nds from private Japanese owners, arguing that nationalists would otherwise have bought them. China also reacted strongly Tuesday to news that two Japanese swam to one of the islands from a boat.
''The current escalation of tension ov er this dispute was totally caused by the Japanese side,'' General Liang said. ' 'The Chinese people have every reason to feel more concerned, because it regards it as China's territory.''
During his visits this week to Tokyo and Beijin g, Mr. Panetta has reiterated American policy, which is not to take sides in the region's territorial disputes and to urge a negotiated settlement. He said the United States was was advocating ''open channels of communication in order to re solve these disputes diplomatically and peacefully.''

HEADLINE: Comments Could Vex a Romney Administration
<B YL>By DAVID E. SANGER; Jodi Rudoren contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Sh aron LaFraniere from Boston.

 BODY:
BOSTON -- No one has ever had any illusions ab out where Mitt Romney stands on the two hottest disputes in the Middle East: the argument over the creation of a Palestinian state, and the debate over what can be done to assure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.
In both cases, he has taken positions very close to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, his friend from their days together as young consultants here in Boston . 
But if he is elected president in November and finds himself i n negotiations over a future Palestine on Israel's borders, Mr. Romney may find that his comment at a campaign fund-raiser -- captured on video -- that ''there' s just no way'' a separate state can be workable could undermine his effectivene ss in bringing the two sides together. And any dealings with the mullahs of Iran may not be facilitated by his description of them, in the same video, as ''craz y people.''
Mr. Romney's aides, in interviews on Tuesday at the campaign's headquarters in the North End of Boston, played down the statements. They said that there was no news in the Iran comments, and that Mr. Romney was simply argu ing for a more credible strategy that would strike fear in the Iranian leadershi p. And they said his position on the Palestinian dispute remained unchanged: he believes in a two-state solution, the kind President George W. Bush endorsed ear ly in his presidency.
On both the Palestinian and Iran issues, the aides sa id the real problem was President Obama, who they said had not been tough enough with Iran and had left the Mideast peace process to die, worsening the problem by separating the United States from Israel and leaving its ally feeling insecur e and unwilling to negotiate.
Mr. Romney's foreign and legal policy direct or, Alex Wong, said the candidate believed that while Mr. Obama says the militar y option for dealing with Iran is on the table, ''he spends more time worrying a bout an Israeli strike than he does about stopping Iranian nuclear capability.''
Still, Mr. Romney's comments on the video left the strong impression that he believes any Palestinian state, jammed close to Israel's most vital and econo mically vibrant cities, may well be unworkable. He said he had felt ''for some t ime'' that ''the Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace, and that the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish.''
Mr. R omney asked his audience to imagine a map where the ''border would be, maybe sev en miles from Tel Aviv,'' and on ''the other side of what would be this new Pale stinian state would either be Syria at one point or Jordan.''
''And of cour se the Iranians would want to do through the West Bank exactly what they did thr ough Lebanon, what they did in Gaza,'' Mr. Romney said, ''which is, the Iranians would want to bring missiles and armament into the West Bank and potentially th reaten Israel.''
If Israel patrolled the border, he went on, ''the Palestin ians would say: 'No way! We're an independent country. You can't, you know, guar d our border with other Arab nations.' ''
''And now how about the airport? How about flying into this Palestinian nation? Are we going to allow military ai rcraft to come in and weaponry to come in? And if not, who's going to keep it fr om coming in? Well, the Israelis. Well, the Palestinians are going to say, 'We'r e not an independent nation if Israel is able to come in and tell us what can la nd in our airport.' ''
He concluded: ''I look at the Palestinians not wanti ng to see peace anyway, for political purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel, and these thorny issues, and I say, there's just no way. ''
Mr. Romney said the best that could be hoped for was ''some degree of st ability, but you recognize that this is going to remain an unsolved problem.''<P A> The Palestinians, not surprising, had a different view. Yehia Moussa, a Hama s official in Gaza, argued that the United States had ''never been suitable'' as an arbiter in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute because it instinctively sided wi th Israel.
''We are sensing a new pattern of alliances among the Zionist lo bby and the rightist Americans who believe in Zionist legends and predictions,'' Mr. Moussa said. ''Romney is part of this.''
Mr. Netanyahu's spokesman, Ma rk Regev, said the prime minister would not comment.
On Iran, Mr. Romney m ade an argument -- often repeated by experts in both political parties -- that t he biggest risk of an Iranian nuclear program is that it would supply terrorist groups with the means to make a nuclear weapon or a ''dirty bomb,'' a convention al device laced with radioactive material that can make parts of a city uninhabi table. But his problem may come in how he characterized the Iranian leadership.
''America could be held up and blackmailed by Iran, by the mullahs, by cra zy people,'' he said. ''So we really don't have any option but to keep Iran from having a nuclear weapon.''
Mr. Romney's aides did not say whether he beli eved that Iran's leaders were rational actors who could be subjected to pressure .

HEADLINE: Let Them Eat Crab Cake

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Oh, for the days when we tho ught Mitt Romney didn't stand for anything.
As a secret video fr om a Boca Raton fund-raiser with high rollers in May shows, Romney in private st ands for so many bizarre things that it's hard to tell what's crazier -- his dom estic policy or his foreign policy.
Less than 50 days before the election, we learn that Romney may have given up on half of America and on Mideast peace.< PA> In a reply to a fat cat at the $50,000-a-plate dinner, he wrote off 47 perc ent of the country as deadbeats, freeloaders and ''victims'' who feel they're en titled to stuff -- stuff like basic sustenance. 
''Well, there are 47 percen t of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,'' he said. ''All right? There are 47 percent who are with him. Who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsib ility to care for them, who believe that they're entitled to health care, to foo d, to housing, to you-name-it.''
The candidate, who pays so little in taxes relative to his income that he has to hide tax returns and money in Switzerland and the Cayman Islands, then added, condescendingly: ''These are people who pay no income tax.''
''So my job is not to worry about those people,'' he blit hely concluded. ''I'll never convince them that they should take personal respon sibility and care for their lives.'' What kind of presidential candidate shrugs off wooing whole groups -- we're talking many seniors and white-working-class vo ters in battleground states who are, if he actually knew what he was talking abo ut, his own natural constituencies?
A ''stupid and arrogant'' one, as Bill Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, put it.
Conservatives knew that Romney was no Reagan, but the tape left many Republicans and Obama strategists gobsmacked. One top Democrat called it ''a treasure trove of stupid answers.''<P A> On Fox News Tuesday, Neil Cavuto gently asked Romney if he had ''prematurely '' presumed that he couldn't get all of those voters. Mitt's rambles to the dono rs, released by Mother Jones magazine and, in a bit of poetic justice, unearthed by Jimmy Carter's grandson, were a stunning combination of wrong facts, callous sentiments and dumb politics.
He seemed to have bought into the warped can ard that some conservatives inside and outside of Congress have pushed: that the president and Nancy Pelosi were nefariously hooking people on unemployment bene fits so they'd get addicted and vote Democratic to keep the unemployment bucks f lowing like crack.
It's literally rich: Willard, born on third base and ac ting self-made, whining to the rich about what a great deal in life the poor hav e.
We thought Romney was secretly moderate, but it turns out that he's sec retly cruel, a social Darwinist just like his running mate.
You'd assume th at it would be hard now for Romney to resume bashing President Obama for demoniz ing and pandering on class warfare, with lines like he's been using on the trail : ''he and his allies are pushing us all even further apart by dividing us into groups.''
But, even as Mitt was spitefully demonizing and dividing in Boca, he remained cardboard-cutout un-self-aware, musing: ''The thing which I find mo st disappointing about this president is his attack of one America against anoth er America.'' This is the absolute height of cluelessness.
At another point in the video, Romney once more showed his foreign policy jejuneness, questionin g the workability of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, wh ich is U.S. policy endorsed by W.
Mr. Sunshine said he sometimes felt ''th at the Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace -- and tha t the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish.''
He continued: ''You hope for some degree of stability, but you recognize this is going to rem ain an unsolved problem,'' adding, ''And we kick the ball down the field and hop e that ultimately somehow, something will happen to resolve it.''
Wow. That 's leadership. He said a former secretary of state had called him to suggest tha t after the Palestinian elections there might be a prospect for a settlement, bu t that ''I didn't delve into it.''
After months of doggedly trying to seem more likable, sharing his guilty pleasures like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and S nooki, Romney came across as a mean geek, a Cranbrook kid at the country club sm ugly swaddled in class disdain. He thinks being president is his manifest destin y. His father didn't make it, so he will -- no matter what far-out conservative positions he must graft on to in order to do it.
We're in search of the re al Romney. But, disturbingly, so is he.
One thing we have to give Mitt, tho ugh: He is, as advertised, a brilliant manager. He's managed to ensure that Pres ident Obama has a much better chance of re-election.

HEADLINE: Much of Romney's View on Taxes Conflicts With L ongtime G.O.P. Stand

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY and MICHAEL COOPER; Michael Barbaro c ontributed reporting from Salt Lake City.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney decided to fully join the battle on social programs, warning in an interview Tuesday wi th Fox News that the nation's spending was putting it ''on a pathway that looks more European than American.''
In standing by the substance, if not the tone, of his surreptitiously recorded remarks at a private fund-raiser in May and pub lished on Monday, Mr. Romney waded into an ideological clash pitting two strands of conservative thinking against each other: the longstanding goal of reducing the tax burden on the poor with tax credits versus the growing anxiety that the nation's ''takers'' are now overtaking its ''makers.''
The stati stic Mr. Romney referred to at the fund-raiser came from the nonpartisan Tax Pol icy Center, which published an analysis showing that 46.4 percent of American ho useholds did not pay federal income tax in 2011. That statistic shocked many pol icy elites, small-government populists and members of Congress and has led to co nservative hand-wringing. 
The households in question consist primarily of the retired, the poor and low-income families with children, according to nonpar tisan analysts. Moreover, they do pay taxes, if not income taxes: Just 8 percent of households do not pay payroll or federal income taxes, discounting the elder ly.
Mr. Romney stood by his statement in an interview with Neil Cavuto of Fox News on Tuesday. ''I think a society based upon a government-centered nation where government plays a larger and larger role, redistributes money, that's th e wrong course for America,'' he said, adding that he hoped to improve the econo my enough that people would be able to get well-paying jobs and rejoin the tax r olls.
Mr. Romney's thinking on the matter has been shaped in part by Arthu r C. Brooks, the president of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Mr . Brooks said that he had discussed his new book, ''The Road to Freedom: How to Win the Fight for Free Enterprise,'' with Mr. Romney, who was particularly inter ested in whether redistribution would lead to a disengaged electorate -- with th e government paying for programs benefiting more people with dollars coming from fewer of them.
''It's not necessarily a good thing for the country that m ore people are pulling more benefits out of the system than they're paying in,'' Mr. Brooks said in an interview. ''That's not a healthy thing for citizenship, and it's not good for these people themselves either, if they feel attenuated fr om their government.''
The notion that too few Americans are paying income taxes has gained currency on the right in recent years. An influential 2002 Wal l Street Journal editorial called the millions of American households that do no t pay income tax ''lucky duckies.'' Last year, Erick Erickson, the conservative firebrand, started a Web site called ''We Are the 53 Percent,'' mocking the 99-p ercent theme of Occupy Wall Street and chiding Americans for failing to pull the mselves up by their bootstraps.
But other Republicans have argued that the focus on the people who do not pay taxes is a mistake.
Reihan Salam, a con servative author, wrote on National Review Online on Tuesday that ''the version of conservative tax policy I favor might actually further reduce the share of ta x units that pay federal income taxes, yet it would strengthen the work ethic, i ncrease labor force participation, and discourage the kind of dependency that co ncerns Mitt Romney.''
For a long time, cutting taxes for the poor was a maj or emphasis of the Republican Party. One reason that many poor people no longer pay federal income taxes is that they qualify for credits such as the earned-inc ome tax credit, which has its roots in conservative thinking and has long been s upported by members of both parties as a way to help the poor without increasing welfare payments or raising the minimum wage. The credit was added to the tax c ode when Gerald Ford was president, and was expanded by Republicans and Democrat s, including President Ronald Reagan, who called it ''one of the best anti-pover ty programs this country has ever seen'' in 1986.
President George W. Bush , for his part, doubled the child tax credit, and his tax cuts erased the federa l income tax liability for millions of households.
And even as he attacked the entitlements of nontaxpaying households, Mr. Romney has pledged not to raise the share of taxes paid by families making less than $200,000 a year -- a promi se some analysts say is difficult to square with his proposal to cut tax rates a nd eliminate tax deductions. And he has proposed eliminating the taxes they pay on interest, dividends and capital gains.
Donald B. Marron Jr., the directo r of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, whose analysis Mr. Romney cited on the t ape, said the tax code, by design, often aids the working poor. ''This is due to longstanding, structural decisions in our tax code,'' he said.
In any case , the debate within the Republican Party promises to continue. On Tuesday, many conservatives criticized Mr. Romney's comments, and some Republican candidates f or the Senate distanced themselves from them. Many others said that they support ed his underlying ideas.
''There's something mistaken about his analysis,'' David Azerrad of the Heritage Foundation, a right-of-center Washington research group. ''But there is something in the substance that points to something corre ct. There is a shift in our relationship with the government that we've witnesse d in the past century, with more people ensnared in the tentacles of the welfare state.''
But both political parties have contributed to the growth of ent itlement spending, and the benefits have not accrued just to Democratic voters a s Mr. Romney suggested on the video.
Nicholas Eberstadt of the American En terprise Institute argues that entitlements are corrupting America in his forthc oming book ''A Nation of Takers: America's Entitlement Epidemic.'' But he says t hat the growth of entitlement spending over the past half century has been great er under Republican administrations than Democratic ones.
''Between 1960 an d 2010, the growth of entitlement spending was exponential,'' he wrote in a rece nt excerpt published by The Wall Street Journal, ''but in any given year, it was on the whole roughly 8 percent higher if the president happened to be a Republi can rather than a Democrat.''
The states with the highest percentage of fed eral filers who do not owe income taxes tend to vote Republican in presidential elections. An analysis by the Tax Foundation found that in 2008 the state with t he highest percentage of federal filers with no tax liability was Mississippi, a nd that most of the states with the highest percentage of filers with no liabili ty were in the South.
And the politics of who receives help from the govern ment are complex as well. Research by Dean Lacy, a professor of government at Da rtmouth College, has found that states that receive more in federal spending tha n they pay in taxes have become increasingly Republican in presidential election s.
''Since 1984,'' he said in an interview Tuesday, ''the states that get the most money in federal spending per tax dollar paid have become increasingly Republican.''

HEADLINE: Tight C ontest Casts Light on Latina Vote

BYLINE: By LUISITA LOPEZ TORREGROSA

 BODY:
NEW YOR K -- In what seems a Herculean task, the Republican Party is mounting a major ca mpaign to chip away at the Democratic Party's dominance among Hispanic voters, w ho could determine victory or defeat in the presidential election in several swi ng states.
And, perhaps even more surprising, a major feature of that Republi can push is directed at Hispanic women.
With President Barack Ob ama and the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, running very close in the latest polls, gaining even a sliver of Hispanic votes could be crucial to either party -- but especially to the Republican ticket.
Smarting from an image as an an ti-Latino party, the Republicans are turning up the spotlight on Senator Marco R ubio of Florida; Susana Martinez of New Mexico, the first Latina governor in the country; and Governor Brian Sandoval of Nevada. The Democrats, not to seem comp lacent, showcased Mayor Julin Castro of San Antonio and Mayor Antonio Villaraig osa of Los Angeles at their national convention. 
For decades, the Hispanic vote has eluded and confounded Republicans. Except in Florida, where until rece ntly conservative Cuban-Americans gave Republicans the edge, Democrats have had a lock on the Hispanic vote. At this point in the campaign, Mr. Obama holds a co mmanding lead over Mr. Romney among Hispanics, 68 percent to 26 percent, in a po ll released Monday by the independent polling group ImpreMedia/Latino Decisions. The same survey found Mr. Obama's edge among Hispanic women to be even greater: 74 percent to 21 percent.
Against those odds, Republican Hispanic Outreac h is trying to build a national network of paid staff and bilingual volunteers w ho operate at local and state levels, tailoring their message to diverse Hispani cs with a focus on battleground states like Florida, Colorado, Nevada and New Me xico.
''It's our largest effort ever to reach out to Latino voters,'' says Bettina Inclan, who heads the Outreach program.
With an extra focus on wom en, she said last week, the campaign has enlisted Latinas to promote a friendly party image and sell its pitch through phone banks, door-to-door visits, fund-ra isers and house parties.
''The message of this campaign really focuses on the important issue for women, the economy,'' she said. ''The Obama economy hits women the hardest.''
In this tough climate, in the Republican view, combus tible women's rights issues like abortion, mandated insurance coverage for contr aceptives and Planned Parenthood do not get top billing. How their view plays ou t, and whether it gains ground, is unclear. The latest New York Times/CBS News p oll, released Friday, gives Mr. Obama a 12-point edge among women likely to vote .
Yet Ms. Inclan, a 32-year-old Floridian from a Cuban-Mexican family, said she had seen ''an incredible increase all across the board for Mitt Romney.''<P A> ''We're seeing more and more Latinas join the ranks of this campaign,'' she said. ''Latinas really want change. Their big issue is to see that their familie s live the American dream that will be harder and harder to accomplish because o f Obama's economic policies. That's why a lot of women, especially Latinas, are joining the Romney campaign.''
On Monday, Mr. Romney spoke at the United S tates Hispanic Chamber of Commerce convention in Los Angeles. But his message wa s obscured by the controversy surrounding a video made at a private fund-raiser in May in which Mr. Romney described nearly half of Americans as ''people who pa y no income tax'' and are ''dependent upon government.'' At that same fund-raise r, according to another clip, Mr. Romney was heard joking that he would have an easier time winning if his father had been born to Mexican parents. It seems lik ely that such remarks would hardly ingratiate him with Latinos.
Before thos e comments surfaced, Vivian Bileca, a 42-year-old Miami mother of three who has not always been a party-line Republican, told me by telephone, ''I felt comforta ble with President Clinton because he was in the center, but now the Democrats a re too far to the left. I see my children and feel that the Republicans can give them more, a better life.'' She recalled her Cuban parents. ''I want to give my children more than my parents could give to me. Now my biggest worry is the nat ional debt.''
Another Floridian, Lida Mari Todd, a married speech therapist in her 40s, with two children, told me, ''For my circle of women, our passion i s for our children and husbands and parents. I fear for my children's future now . I've worked and worked so hard to make it, it makes my skin crawl to hear that 'You didn't make it on your own.''' (She was referring to Mr. Obama's statement that small-business owners and entrepreneurs do not make it entirely on their o wn.)
''My mother came to this country nine months pregnant with me,'' Ms. Todd recalled. ''I have that as an example, and my father held two and three job s. They surely made it on their own.''
Other Latinas take a different view .
''I would certainly vote Republican,'' says Estela Rizzuto, a Dominican American who is 41, single and works in broadcasting in New York. She came from a Republican-leaning family and ''up until 2008, I was an independent. It wasn't until I watched Barack Obama campaigning that I felt compelled to switch and re gister as a Democrat.'' She added: ''I particularly take issue with the current Republican views on women's rights and health care.''
Mariola Pea, 38, a m other of three from Arlington, Virginia, grew up in a Republican-leaning Cuban-P uerto Rican family. ''As a Catholic Latin American woman, I am conservative in m any of my personal decisions,'' she told me in an e-mail. ''But I choose a presi dent whose politics protect the environment, respects international law and repr esents the United States as a global player, and whose economic perspectives str engthen the middle class, and who is aware of the rich diversity of this nation. '' That man, she said, is Mr. Obama.
Whether it is the Lida Mari Todds or t he Mariola Peas who prevail among Latinas may well help determine who wins on N ov. 6. And whether this campaign sees Republicans making inroads into the growin g Hispanic vote will be one interesting feature of Election Day, no matter who t riumphs.

HEADLINE: Republicans Push Bill to Help Foreign Scienc e Graduates Stay

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Republican leaders in the House of Representatives, hoping to pass a measure before the November elections to impro ve legal immigration, are pushing for a vote this week on a bill that would incr ease the number of permanent resident visas for foreigners graduating from Ameri can universities with advanced degrees in science and technology.
The largely partisan bill was introduced on Tuesday by Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. It would allocate up to 55,000 visas, known as green cards, each year to graduates with master's or d octoral degrees from American universities, by means of a trade-off. The bill wo uld abolish a lottery run each year that distributes the same number of green ca rds randomly to applicants from countries that do not have large immigrant popul ations in the United States. 
The nearly 50 other sponsors of Mr. Smith's bill include only one Democrat -- Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas . Mr. Smith and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, hav e said the House will vote on Thursday.
A partisan fight broke out over Mr . Smith's approach, which would not increase the overall number of green cards i ssued annually. On Friday Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, a Democrat w hose district is home to many technology companies, introduced a measure that wo uld create 50,000 new green cards for advanced graduates in the so-called STEM f ields: science, technology, engineering and mathematics. That bill would not red uce the visas available to the lottery.
On Tuesday, Charles E. Schumer of N ew York, the Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary immigration subcom mittee, introduced a bill that was close to Ms. Lofgren's measure, creating a tw o-year pilot program to give 55,000 new green cards each year to foreign graduat es.
Democrats in both houses, especially Hispanic and black lawmakers, are reluctant to end the lottery without some compromise, for example giving additi onal green cards to family members of legal immigrants already here. Many winner s of the lottery, which was created in 1990, come from African countries.
Behind the partisan maneuvering over details, there was notable bipartisan accor d -- rare in this polarized Congress -- on the broad goals of the legislation: t o offer visas so science and technology graduates could remain here and start bu sinesses to create jobs.
''In a global economy, we cannot afford to educat e these foreign graduates in the U.S. and then send them back home to work for o ur competitors,'' Mr. Smith said on Tuesday.
Currently, when foreign studen ts finish their graduate studies they either have to leave or head into a labyri nth of temporary visas, where it can take years to get a permanent green card. < PA> Last week, 165 leaders of American universities sent a letter to President Obama and to Congress warning that the lack of visas for advanced science gradua tes was ''a critical threat to America's pre-eminence as a global center of inno vation and prosperity.'' Among those signing were presidents of Stanford, Harvar d, Cornell, the California Institute of Technology and M.I.T.
According to the university leaders, in 2009 foreigners made up about 45 percent of all grad uate students in engineering, math, computer and physical sciences, and they ear ned 52 percent of all new doctoral degrees in those fields.
All three of th e new proposals include labor market tests that would require employers to show they could not find a qualified American worker before they sponsored a foreign graduate for a green card and a job.
With Congressional lawmakers expectin g this to be their last week in session before they head out to campaign, Republ icans said they want to show they are working to make good on pledges made at th eir convention last month. The Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, said he would focus on fixing the system for legal immigration.
President Obama has also said he supports more green cards for science graduates.
Technology groups watched the partisan jockeying with worry, fearing that no legislation would pa ss.
''We have a new class graduating in December and we don't want to lose those people,'' said Keith Grzelak, a vice president of the Institute of Electr ical and Electronic Engineers, a group with more than 200,000 members. ''If we b ring one superstar from another country who starts a company here, there could b e thousands of jobs that didn't exist before.''
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, a strong advocate of high-skilled immigration, urged lawmakers not to miss the moment. ''There are real options for immigration reform on the tabl e now, and from both sides of the aisle,'' he said on Tuesday.
It was not clear Republicans had enough votes to pass the bill this week.
''Republica ns are only willing to increase legal immigration for immigrants they want by el iminating legal immigration for immigrants they don't want,'' said Representativ e Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, a leading Hispanic Democrat. But if Mr. Smith's bi ll passes, Mr. Schumer's measure may point to a compromise in the Senate when Co ngress reconvenes after the Nov. 6 election.

HEADLINE: Negotiators Meet in Bid To Revive Iran Talks

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
The top nuclear negotiators for Iran and the big pow ers met face to face for the first time in nearly three months on Tuesday, part of an effort to revive the stalled talks over Iran's disputed uranium enrichment activities as new military tensions roil the Middle East.
The meeting betwee n the negotiators, Catherine Ashton, the European Union's top foreign policy off icial, and Saeed Jalili, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Counc il, was held privately in Istanbul and was not considered a formal negotiation. Michael Mann, Ms. Ashton's spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement that it was ''a useful and constructive meeting and an important opportunity to stress once again to Iran the urgent need to make progress.'' 
The last time Ms. Ashton and Mr. Jalili met was June 18-20 in Moscow, where teams for Iran and the P5-plus-1 countries -- the five permanent members of the United Nations Sec urity Council plus Germany -- walked away in frustration.
A series of lower -level contacts since then led to the Istanbul meeting, which came against a bac kdrop of tightening Western economic sanctions on Iran, new disclosures of sabot age at Iran's uranium enrichment sites and shrill exchanges between Iran and Isr ael over the possibility that Israel may attack Iran.
Iran has insisted th at it is enriching uranium for peaceful uses and has rejected Security Council d emands that it halt the activity until questions about the possible weaponizatio n of its nuclear fuel stockpile are answered. Last week the International Atomic Energy Agency, the monitoring arm of the United Nations, rebuked Iran for refus ing to grant inspectors unlimited access to sites where they believe suspicious activity may have occurred.
Iran's most senior atomic energy official resp onded on Monday by asserting that the I.A.E.A. had been compromised by ''terrori sts and saboteurs,'' and he disclosed that power lines to its two main uranium e nrichment sites had been hit by explosions. The official, Fereydoon Abbasi, did not say whether the sites had been damaged, but his assertions raised the possib ility that Israel, the United States or some other groups had carried out anothe r attack in a clandestine effort to subvert the enrichment program short of a mi litary attack.
The I.A.E.A. did not comment on Mr. Abbasi's assertions, bu t in a statement on Tuesday it said that the agency's director general, Yukiya A mano, had met with Mr. Abbasi and told him ''it is essential for Iran to extend its full cooperation to the agency.''
In a rising show of military force me ant as a signal to Iran, the United States is leading a 30-nation naval mine-cle aring exercise in the Persian Gulf in 12 days of maneuvers that began on Monday. Iran responded on Tuesday by deploying what the state-run news media called a h omemade missile destroyer, a newly refurbished submarine and a new underground m issile launchpad in the northern city of Noshahr.
Western powers have said negotiations are the preferred solution to the nuclear issue. Britain added pre ssure on Tuesday, with its foreign secretary, William Hague, telling lawmakers i n London that although the sanctions were having a major impact, ''we will be in tensifying those sanctions in the coming weeks and months in the absence of succ essful negotiations.''
In the United States, United Against Nuclear Iran, an advocacy group that helped pressure a global banking communications network t o expel sanctioned Iranian banks, said it had undertaken a new effort to force t he authorities who assign international Internet addresses to block sanctioned I ranian entities and persons from access to the Web.
In letters sent to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, known as ICANN, based in L os Angeles, and the Rseaux IP Europens Network Coordination Centre, known as R IPE NCC, based in Amsterdam, the advocacy group's president, Mark D. Wallace, sa id they may be in violation of Iran sanctions and that by disconnecting Internet access, ''the dictatorial regime of Iran would be severely impeded in pursuing its illegal and amoral activities.''
ICANN officials did not respond to req uests for comment. RIPE NCC, in a statement posted on its Web site, said that it did not believe it had violated sanctions ''but we will investigate in cases wh ere new information is provided to us and we will ensure that changing circumsta nces do not place the RIPE NCC in violation of sanctions.''

HEADLINE: Wisconsin Offers Window Into Challenges Confrontin g Romney

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Jeff Zeleny reported from R acine, and Marjorie Connelly from New York. Allison Kopicki, Marina Stefan and M egan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
RACINE, Wis. -- To Mi tt Romney, the 10 electoral votes in Wisconsin may be more essential than extra, a critical backup plan if a first-tier battleground state falls out of reach.<P A>Seven weeks until the election, with Mr. Romney facing new questions about his ability to gain trust among voters experiencing economic hardships, his campaig n is increasingly pointing to Wisconsin as a place where a statewide Republican resurgence could rub off on Mr. Romney.
But President Obama has overtaken Mr. Romney on who would do a better job handling the economy, accordi ng to a new Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll of likely Wiscons in voters. The poll also found that Mr. Obama has a 17-point edge over Mr. Romne y when voters are asked if a candidate cares about their needs and problems.
As the president makes his first campaign visit of the year to Wisconsin on Sa turday, the poll found that Mr. Obama was the choice of 51 percent to 45 percent for Mr. Romney among likely voters. The six-point lead, which includes those wh o said they were leaning in one direction or another, marks a slight shift in Mr . Obama's direction since Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin joined the Re publican ticket last month. 
The findings of the poll, along with the fallo ut from newly exposed remarks Mr. Romney made at a fund-raiser in which he blunt ly suggested that 47 percent of Americans saw themselves as victims who are depe ndent on the government, offer a window into the challenges confronting his camp aign here and other important swing states during the final 48 days of the race.
Rob Jankowski, an independent voter who supported Mr. Obama four years ago but has been disappointed by his economic leadership and disapproves of his hea lth care plan, is among the 3 percent of voters in the survey who say they are s till undecided. He said he did not feel loyalty to Mr. Obama simply because he s upported him last time, but he said Mr. Romney had not made his case.
''Oba ma is putting out his plans and his details and being more public on that, but w ith Romney it's kind of gray,'' said Mr. Jankowski, 39, speaking in a follow-up interview Tuesday afternoon here in Jefferson Park, as a cool breeze rustled the tree leaves. ''I'd like to know more -- educate me.''
The New York Times, in collaboration with Quinnipiac and CBS News, is tracking the presidential race with recurring polls in six states. The latest collection of surveys also inclu ded Colorado, where Mr. Romney is running nearly even with Mr. Obama, and Virgin ia, where Mr. Obama has a narrow advantage of four percentage points, both of wh ich are inside the survey's margin of sampling error of plus or minus three perc entage points for each candidate.
But for Mr. Romney, Wisconsin offers one of the best chances to fight on Mr. Obama's terrain in the Midwest and expand th e battleground map. The Romney campaign has redirected some of its money and man power once intended for Michigan and Pennsylvania to Wisconsin, hoping to create as many paths as possible to reaching the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
The importance of Wisconsin was amplified this week when the l eading ''super PAC'' supporting Mr. Romney, Restore Our Future, bought $820,000 in television advertising for the final stretch of the race. The Romney campaign and the Republican National Committee also have stepped up their investments in the state, underscoring the urgency for Mr. Romney to try and change the landsc ape of the race.
Yet the poll found that Republicans have formidable challe nges in Wisconsin, with Mr. Obama expanding his lead among women and remaining f ar more competitive among men than in many battleground states. The poll found t hat 55 percent of women support Mr. Obama and 41 percent prefer Mr. Romney, but among men there is only a two percentage point difference between the candidates .
''I think Obama has done a much better job than anyone realizes,'' said Laurie Bookstein, 62, an independent voter in Milwaukee, speaking in a follow-up interview. ''I think Obama's honesty and integrity in creating a better economy is important to the country as a whole.''
The degree to which Wisconsin wi ll develop as a top-tier battleground state depends on how the opening waves of advertising by candidates and outside groups settle in.
The airwaves here w ere relatively quiet until last week. Wisconsin has become more appealing to Mr. Romney out of necessity, aides said, with his campaign worried about its trajec tory in Ohio and Virginia.
A victory in Iowa and Wisconsin, for example, wo uld mean 16 electoral votes, more than the 13 of Virginia. If Mr. Romney prevail ed in New Hampshire, that would give him 20 electoral votes, surpassing Ohio's 1 8.
The Romney campaign is strengthened here by one of the most tested party operations in the country, which earlier this summer helped Gov. Scott Walker f ight off a recall challenge. The governor's job approval rating is now 52 percen t, the poll found. Republicans say their gains in 2010, along with Mr. Walker's victory in June, have wiped away Mr. Obama's 14-point advantage from 2008.
The president's overall approval rating in Wisconsin stands at 51 percent, and h e holds an advantage over Mr. Romney across all significant sets of issues, from handling health care, taxes, Medicare and the ability to handle an internationa l crisis.
The poll found that Mr. Romney is backed by more independents tha n Mr. Obama, and a majority of those who are more enthusiastic about voting this year. But Mr. Romney, who has struggled to build a personal connection and an e mpathetic appeal, is viewed by 55 percent of likely voters here as a candidate w hose policies favor the rich compared with 10 percent for the middle class.
The state polls were conducted by telephone, both landlines and cellphones, fro m Sept. 11 to 17 among 1,485 likely voters in Wisconsin, 1,497 likely voters in Colorado and 1,474 likely voters in Virginia. The findings are largely similar a cross the states, particularly Mr. Romney's fading advantage on being the candid ate best equipped to turn around the economy.
''I am voting against Obama b ecause four years ago he made these promises as to what he would do to improve t he economy,'' said Arnold Gesch, 83, a retired real estate broker and independen t voter from Sheboygan, speaking in a follow-up interview. ''I just have no fait h in him.''
It remains an open question how voters will react to the challe nges facing Mr. Romney, including his forceful defense of a secretly recorded vi deo of him at a fund-raiser in May. But a sense of agitation was detected in som e follow-up interviews Tuesday at his suggestion about people being dependent on government.
''I'm not a bottom-feeder like they try to make us out to be,' ' said Eddie Gochenour, 66, a retired engineer from Danville, Va., who said he h ad been a Republican for 44 years but intended to support Mr. Obama.
''I ea rned what I'm getting, and worked all my life for my benefits. I have a good nes t egg, but I also earned what I'm getting from the government.''

HEADLINE: The Great Ameri can Tax Debate

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Come November, the economy -- and who would be better to fi x it -- will probably be at the forefront of voters' minds. But like pretty much every election of the last 60 years, voters' choice will be colored by their vi ews about taxes. If you believe the rich pay too little, chances are you will vo te for Barack Obama. If you think tax rates on wealthy Americans are still too h igh, you will vote for Mitt Romney instead. Speaking to his donors at a fund-rai ser, Mr. Romney argued he has no chance of gaining the vote of the nearly half o f Americans who pay no federal income tax. But he probably has a good chance of capturing the vote of their fellow citizens who think paying no tax is unfair.<P A>The great American tax debate may feel like a stale, perennial feature of our politics. But it is important. The controversy is not merely about how much we p ay in taxes. An equally important question is about who pays them. 
<PA > The liberal end of our political spectrum strongly believes that tax policy s hould aim to reduce inequities in pretax income. After all, a dollar taken from the rich to give to the poor should increase national welfare because the poor v alue that dollar more than the rich do. This would justify a progressive tax sch edule -- with tax rates rising sharply with income.
Conservatives, by contr ast, scoff at the notion of income redistribution by the government. Many have l ong supported flat taxes -- which take roughly the same share of the income, or the spending, of the rich and the poor.
The public shares this polarization . A growing share of Americans believes the rich pay too little in taxes. Many s ay our country would be fairer if those earning more than $250,000 paid more. A CNN/ORC International poll in April found that seven in 10 Americans support the Obama administration's proposal that people making $1 million a year or more pa y at least 30 percent of their income in taxes.
Still, many shrink from rai sing taxes on the wealthy. A McClatchy/Marist poll in July found that more than half of Americans want all the tax cuts passed in the Bush administration to be extended, including those for the richest Americans. What's more, a quarter of A mericans believe the poor don't pay enough, the highest share since Gallup start ed asking the question a decade ago.
When I wrote a column suggesting that top tax rates could rise much higher, many readers disagreed. ''The problem is n ot with the 5 percent who pay half of all federal income taxes, but with the 50 percent who pay no federal income taxes,'' wrote James A. Rowan Jr., an investme nt banker from Baltimore. ''That's the obvious and fair place to go for increase d tax revenue.''
Our skepticism about tax fairness has become an economic a lbatross. Tending to our liberal side, we have built a progressive tax schedule. Despite the decline in top tax rates, the rich today pay a larger share of fede ral taxes than they did decades ago. They pay a larger share of taxes than in Eu rope's social democracies, which have much flatter tax schedules. But the progre ssive system we have built raises comparatively very little money to pay for soc ial programs and to reduce economic inequality. And it does so at a high cost in terms of economic efficiency.
What's more, skepticism about taxes is paral yzing our politics, removing taxes as a potential tool to address our budget def icit. As Andrew Kohut, the pollster who is president of the Pew Research Center, pointed out in a recent report: ''In my years of polling, there has never been an issue such as the deficit on which there has been such a consensus among the public about its importance -- and such a lack of agreement about acceptable sol utions.''
Could we come to a consensus on what taxes we need? There have be en moments in our history when we have rallied around the need to pay Uncle Sam. In 1944, as World War II raged, 85 to 90 percent of taxpayers said their income taxes were fair, according to Gallup. Today, only 59 percent of Americans think the same. That's despite a drop in the top tax rate from 94 percent in 1944 to 35 percent today.
Our skepticism about taxes' legitimacy is unique among de veloped democracies. Among citizens of rich industrial countries, Americans are the least likely to agree that taxing the rich to subsidize the poor is an essen tial job of government in a democracy, according to the World Values Survey.
There is reason to be skeptical that we can build more support for taxation. T he rise of the fiercely antitax Tea Party suggests that Americans are going the other way. And the stagnation of middle-class incomes and fast growth in income inequality since the 1980s have not made taxes any more popular. Income tax rate s are at their lowest point in two decades, yet Gallup finds that about half of Americans still think they are too high.
Economists and other social scient ists suggest that the uniquely American discomfort with taxation may be a perman ent feature of our society, one that holds in good and bad economies.
Some argue that the nation's racial, ethnic and cultural mix undercuts support for ta xes among whites, who believe government spending is a tool to transfer their ha rd-earned dollars to minorities who are different from them.
Others have su ggested that what differentiates Americans is a belief in the fairness of the ec onomic system -- which allows us to accept income inequality as the result of an economy that showers its largess on the most talented, hard-working and product ive citizens.
But maybe it's all a question of understanding what taxes are for. Europeans not only have fewer qualms about paying taxes, they long ago acc epted regressive taxes on consumption as a reasonable price to pay. But they see their taxes at work much more often than Americans do.
For starters, every time they go to their taxpayer-financed doctor, they are reminded. Many America ns, by contrast, have only a foggy idea of what their taxes pay for. Few underst and that taxes subsidize the health insurance from their employer, which would b e much more expensive without the government's hand.
Few understand that tu ition at public colleges (including community colleges), which is $4,774 a year, on average, would rise to $11,064 in the absence of government subsidies. Many think government spending is all politically motivated ''pork.''
''A good r eason for not wanting to pay more in taxes is that we have a wasteful and corrup t government,'' William Brennan, a retiree from Novato, Calif., wrote to me. ''T he more they get, the more they spend on programs to ensure their re-election.''
Indeed, surveys like Pew find that even though most Americans want a small er government, few want to cut any actual government programs. Maybe the way to start building a consensus about taxation is to make the connection between the taxes people pay and the benefits they finance.

HEADLINE:  Romney's Speech From Mother Jones Video

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
Followi ng is the transcript of a video recorded during a private fund-raiser for Mitt R omney last May, published by Mother Jones magazine and transcribed by The New Yo rk Times.
MITT ROMNEY: The president's foreign policy, in my opinion, is form ed in part by a perception he has that his magnetism and his charm and his persu asiveness is so compelling, that he can sit down with people like Putin and Chav ez and Ahmadinejad and they'll find that we're such wonderful people that they'l l go on with us. And they'll stop doing bad things. It's an extraordinarily nav e perception and it led to huge errors in North Korea, in Iraq, obviously in Ira n, in Egypt, around the world. 
My own view is that the centerpi ece of American foreign policy has to be strength. Everything I do will be calcu lated to increasing America's strength. When you stand by your allies, you incre ase your strength. When you attack your allies, you become weaker. When you stan d by your principles, you get stronger. When you have a big military that's bigg er than anyone else's, you're stronger. When you have a strong economy, you buil d American strength. For me, everything is about strength and communicating to p eople what is and is not acceptable. It's speaking softly but carrying a very, v ery, very big stick. And this president, instead, speaks loudly and carries a ti ny stick. And that's not the right course for foreign policy.
I saw Dr. Kis singer in New York ...[Aside] You're not eating!
CROWD MEMBER: I'm mesmeriz ed.
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah ... don't spoil [unintelligible].
I saw Dr. Kissi nger. I said to him, ''How are we perceived around the world?'' And he said, one word: ''Weak.'' We are weak. And that's how this president is perceived, by our friends and unfortunately by our foes. And it's no wonder that people like Kim Jong-un, the new leader of North Korea, announces a long-range missile test only a week after he said he wouldn't. Because it's like, what's this president goin g to do about it? You know, if you can't act, don't threaten. Please?
CROWD MEMBER: Just to follow up on Iraq ...
MR. ROMNEY: I just want to show you how it's done, you take this in your fork [unintelligible].
CROWD MEMBER: [ unintelligible] ... the hostages, on his inauguration. ... My question is really , how can you sort of duplicate that scenario?
MR. ROMNEY: I should ask you , how do I duplicate that scenario?
CROWD MEMBER: I think it had to do with the fact that the Iranians perceive that Reagan would do something to really ge t them out. In other words, he would have the strength, and that's why I'm follo wing on your thing about strength. That's why I'm suggesting that something that you say over the next few months gets the Iranians to understand that their pur suit of a bomb is something that you would [unintelligible]. And I think that's something that could possibly resonate very well with the American public.
MR. ROMNEY: I appreciate the idea.
One of the things that's frustrating to me is that, on a typical day like this, where I do three or four events like thi s, the number of foreign policy questions I get are between zero and one. And th e American people are not concentrated at all upon China, on Russia, Iran, Iraq. This president's failure to put in place a status of forces agreement allowing ten to twenty thousand troops to stay in Iraq: unthinkable! And yet, in that ele ction, in the Jimmy Carter election, the fact that we had hostages in Iran, I me an, that was all we talked about. And we had the two helicopters crash in the de sert, I mean, that was the focus and so him solving that made all the difference in the world. I'm afraid today if you simply got Iran to agree to stand down, t hey'd go, ''Hold on.'' If something of that nature presents itself, I will work to find a way to take advantage of the opportunity.
CROWD MEMBER: Tonight's your lucky night; more foreign policy. With the first time you were in Jerusale m, we appreciate you being there. How do you think that the Palestinian problem can be solved, and what are you going to do about it?
MR. ROMNEY: I'm torn by two perspectives in this regard. One is the one which I've had for some time, which is that the Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peac e, and that the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish. Now why do I say that?
Some might say, well, just let the Palestinians have the West Bank and have security, and set up a separate nation for the Palestinians. And t hen come a couple of thorny questions. I don't have a map here to look up geogra phy, but the border between Israel and the West Bank is obviously right there, r ight next to Tel Aviv, which is the financial capital, the industrial capital of Israel, the center of Israel. It's, what, the border would be seven miles from Tel Aviv to what would be the West Bank. Nine miles. The challenge is, the other side of the West Bank, the other side of what would be this new Palestinian sta te would either be Syria at one point or Jordan. And of course, the Iranians wou ld want to do through the West Bank exactly what they did through Lebanon, and w hat they did into Gaza. Which is the Iranians would want to bring missiles, that armament, into the West Bank and potentially threaten Israel. So Israel, of cou rse, would have to say, ''That can't happen. We've got to keep Iranians from bri nging weaponry into the West Bank.'' Well, that means that, who, the Israelis ar e going to patrol the border between Jordan, Syria and this new Palestinian nati on? Well, the Palestinians would say, ''No way. We're an independent country. Yo u can't guard our border with other Arab nations.''
And then how about the airport. How about flying into this Palestinian nation? Are we going to allow m ilitary aircraft to come in? And weaponry to come in? And if not, who's going to keep it from coming in? Well, the Israelis. Well, the Palestinians are going to say, ''We're not an independent nation if Israel is able to come in and tell us what to land at our airport.''
These problems -- they're very hard to solv e. And I look at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political purposes. Committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel. And these tho rny issues. And I say, there's just no way. So what you do is you move things al ong the best way you can, you hope for some degree of stability. But you recogni ze this is going to remain an unsolved problem. We live with that in China and T aiwan. We have a potentially volatile situation, but we sort of live with it. An d we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately somehow, something wi ll happen and resolve it. We don't go to war to try and resolve it imminently.<P A> On the other hand, I got a call from a former secretary of state -- and I wo n't mention which one it was -- but this individual said to me, ''You know, I th ink there's a prospect for a settlement between the Palestinians and the Israeli s after the Palestinian elections.'' I said, ''Really?'' And, you know, his answ er was yes. I think there's some prospect. And I didn't delve into it, but you k now, I always keep open the idea. But I have to tell you, the idea of pushing on the Israelis to give something up to get the Palestinians to act is the worst i dea in the world. We have done that time and time and time again. It does not wo rk. So the only answer is show strength, again. American strength, American reso lve, and if the Palestinians someday reach a point where they want peace more th an we're trying to force peace on them, then it's worth having the discussion. B ut until then it's just wishful thinking.
CROWD MEMBER: Individuals in this room obviously are your supporters. I am very concerned about the average Ameri can who doesn't know you. There is a terrible misconception and I spend numerous hours trying [unintelligible] to be your defender when you are such a deserving individual. You were saying years ago that ''I called George Bush Sr., and he h ad helped me in my campaign in Massachusetts when I ran for Senate. I told him t hat there was a guy named Clinton who was [unintelligible] for the following rea sons, and he laughed.'' Right now, I'm very concerned. Women do not want to vote for you. Hispanics, the majority of them do not want to vote for you. College s tudents don't. After talking to them and explaining and rationalizing on a one-o n-one basis, we are able to change their opinions, but at a mass level, what do you want us to do, this group here, as your emissaries, going out to convert the se individuals to someone who's obviously going to be such an incredible asset t o this country. We want you. What do we do? Just tell us how we can help.
M R. ROMNEY: I have some good news for you. It's not impossible. And the reason I say that is because, for instance, The New York Times had a poll last week, The New York Times and NBC, and I was leading by two points among women. Now the pre sident came out and said: ''This is an outrageous poll. They don't know what the y're doing.'' But, by the way, the polls at this stage make no difference at all . The point is, women are open to supporting me; they like the president persona lly, but they're disappointed. They're disappointed with the jobs that they're s eeing for their kids. They're disappointed with their own economic standing righ t now. So we can capture women's votes.
We're having a much harder time wit h Hispanic voters. And if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the D emocrats as the African-American voting bloc has in the past, well, we're in tro uble as a party and, I think, as a nation.
CROWD MEMBER: Rubio!
[Crowd rumblings, unintelligible, and laughter]
MR. ROMNEY: We have some great Hi spanic leaders in our party that will help communicate what our party stands for , and frankly, what I need you to do is raise millions of dollars because the pr esident is going to have eight hundred, nine hundred million dollars. That's by far the most important thing you can do, because you don't have the capacity to speak to hundreds of thousands of people. I will be in those debates. There will be, I don't know, a hundred and fifty million Americans watching. If I do well, it'll help. If I don't, it won't help.
CROWD MEMBER: You will do so well. Your debates are incredible.
[Applause]
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you. But a dvertising makes a difference. The president will engage in a personal, characte r assassination campaign, and so we'll have to fire back, one in defense and, nu mber two, in offense. And that'll take money. By the way, you'll see the ads her e. Florida will be one of those states that is the key state, and so all of the money will get spent in 10 states and this is one of them. So the best thing I c an ask you to do is, yeah, sure, talk to people and tell them that you know me a nd word of mouth makes a big difference, but you know, I'm not terribly well kno wn by the American public because ...
CROWD MEMBER: You're known as a rich boy. They say he's a rich man.
MR. ROMNEY: Don't worry. Given all those neg ative things, the fact that I'm either tied or close to the president, and the f act that he's out there talking about the one-year anniversary of Osama bin Lade n being captured, unemployment coming down, unleashing his campaign, we're still sort of tied? That's very interesting. Please.
CROWD MEMBER: I would disag ree with that. I think a lot of young children coming out of college feel they w ere let down by the president. They feel that there's not a job out there for th em, and they thought they were going to make sixty thousand and now they're maki ng thirty thousand. Very similar to the U6. My question to you is, why don't you stick up for yourself? To me, you should be so proud that you're wealthy. That' s what we all aspire to, we kill ourselves. We don't work 9-to-5. We're way ... [unintelligible] five days a week. I raise four girls five days a week. Why not stick up for yourself and say why is it bad to aspire to be wealthy and successf ul? Why is it bad to kill yourself and why is it bad to cut thirty jobs at the d eath of three hundred? When there's people cutting jobs ... you saved companies that were failing. So my question is, when does that [unintelligible] ... worked his way up to nothing to his present success.
MR. ROMNEY: You heard in my speech tonight ... oh, you weren't here. In every stump speech I give, I speak a bout the fact that people who bring and achieve enormous success do not make us poorer, they make us better off. And the Republican audience that I typically sp eak to applauds. I said that tonight, and the media is there and they write abou t it, they say that Mr. Romney defends success and America and dreamers and so f orth. So they write about it. But in terms of what gets through to the American consciousness, I have heard a [unintelligible] lid full of that, as to what they write about. We will have three debates, we'll have a chance to talk about that at the debates, there will be ads which attack me, I will fire back, in a way t hat describes the best way we can ... I mean the theme of my speech is ... I win d up talking about how the thing which I find most disappointing in this preside nt is his attack of one America against another America, the division of America based on going after those who have been successful. And then I quote Marco Rub io in my speeches, I say Marco Rubio ... I don't think I said that at the fund-r aising event earlier today, but I did when I was ... I just said, Senator Rubio says that when he grew up here, poor, that they looked at people who had a lot o f wealth and his parents never once said, we need some of what they have, they s hould give us something. Instead they said, if we work hard and go to school, so meday we might be able to have the same thing.
[Applause]
I will cont inue to do that. How much of that gets picked up ... there's so many things that don't get picked up in a campaign because people aren't watching and, by the wa y, most people don't watch during the summer. I say we're going to go into a sea son here, starting in mid-June, where almost no one pays attention. Then, after Labor Day, in September and October, that's when it'll get [unintelligible]
CROWD MEMBER: Over the past three years, all everybody's been told is, don't w orry, we'll take care of it. How are you going to do it, with two months before the election, to convince everybody you've got to take care of yourself?
MR . ROMNEY: Well, there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the preside nt no matter what. There are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement and govern ment should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter wha t. I mean, the president starts off with 48, 49 ... I mean, he starts off with a huge number. These are people who pay no income tax; 47 percent of Americans pa y no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn't connect. He'll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich. I mean, that's what they sell every four y ears. And so my job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives. What I have to do is convince the 5 to 10 percent in the center, that are independents, that are thoughtful, that look at voting one way or the other depending upon, in som e cases, emotion, whether they like the guy or not, what he looks like.
Wh en you ask those people ... I find it amazing. We do all these polls and poll al l these people to see where we stand in the polls. But 45 percent of the people will vote for the Republican, and 48 or 49 ...
[There is missing video foot age between the two clips.]
... about twice as much as China. Not 10 times as much, like this reporter said. And we have responsibility for the whole worl d. They're only focused on one little area of the world -- the South China Sea, the East China Sea. That's it. And they're building the military at a rapid rate . This idea that we've always spent so much money on the military. ... It's like , ''Guys, don't overthink how strong we are.'' We have said, you probably know, this was a couple of years ago, but we had one of our aircraft carriers standing by Japan, and the Chinese pulled up behind us in a diesel sub, a super quiet di esel sub, pulled up behind us. We could have been torpedoed. We're not that kind of ... our Navy is smaller in number of ships in any time since 1917. And this president wants to shrink it. The list goes on. Our Air Force is older and small er than any time since '47, when the Air Force was formed. And he wants to shrin k it. If we go the way of Europe, which is spending 1 to 2 percent of its econom y on the military, we will not be able to have freedom in the world.
CROWD MEMBER: When the electorate tunes in in September, the markets are going to be l ooking at marginal tax rates going up and another debt ceiling fight ...
MR . ROMNEY: Yeah.
CROWD MEMBER: ... but sequestration under the debt ceiling deal ...
MR. ROMNEY: What do they call it, tax again? Isn't that what they call it?
[Laughter] CROWD MEMBER: Now, the Obamacare praxis on dividends an d capital gains, I mean ... in the markets, you are going to be speaking very li vely in October on all of those issues.
MR. ROMNEY: They'll probably be loo king at what the polls are saying. If it looks like I am going to win, the marke ts will be happy. If it looks like the president is going to win, the markets wi ll not be terribly happy. It depends on, of course, which markets you are talkin g about and which types of commodities and so forth. But my own view is that if we win on Nov. 6, there will be a great deal of optimism about the future of thi s country. We'll see capital come back, and we'll see, without actually doing an ything, we'll actually get a boost to the economy. Um, if the president gets re- elected, I don't know what'll happen. I can never predict what the markets will do. Sometimes it does the exact opposite of what I would have expected. But my o wn view is that if we get the ''tax again,'' as they call it, Jan. 1st with this president and with a Congress that can't work together ... it really is frighte ning. It's really frightening in my view.
CROWD MEMBER: Fifty-four percent of American voters think China's economy is bigger than the U.S. When I first me t you four or five years ago, you did a data call where you went very granular a nd you said, ''Look guys,'' this is a small group, he says, ''This is it. This i s what it is.'' Tell us like it is. How are you going to win if 54 percent of th e voters think China's economy is bigger than ours? Or if it costs 4 cents to ma ke a penny and we keep making pennies? Canada got it right a month ago. Why isn' t someone saying, ''Stop making pennies, round it to the nearest nickel?'' That' s an easy thing, you know, compared to Iran. I want to see you take the gloves o ff and talk to the people that read the paper and read the book and care about k nowing the facts and knowledge is power, as opposed to people that are swayed by what sounds good at the moment. You know, if you turned it into, like, ''Eat wh at you kill,'' it'd be a landslide, in my humble opinion.
MR. ROMNEY: [Laug hs] Well, I wrote a book that lays out my view for what has to happen in the cou ntry. And people who are fascinated by policy will read the book. We have a Web site that lays out white papers and a whole series of issues that I care about. I have to tell you, I don't think this will have a significant impact on my elec tability. I wish it did. I think our ads will have a much bigger impact. I think the debates will have a big impact. Um ...
CROWD MEMBER: [Most of comment unintelligible] ... Peterson ... in trouble 20 years ago.
MR. ROMNEY: But t hat's my point. Which is, being right, my dad used to say, ''Being right early i s not good in politics.'' And, in a setting like this, a highly intellectual sub ject or a discussion of a whole series of important topics typically doesn't win elections. And there are, there are ... I mean, for instance, this president wo n because of hope and change. All right? He won because of hope and change.
CROWD MEMBER: Keep the change!
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah, well ...
[Laughter]
MR. ROMNEY: So, I can tell you that I have a very good team of extraordina rily experienced, highly successful consultants, a couple of people in particula r who've done races around the world. I didn't realize these guys in the U.S., t he Karl Rove equivalents, they do races all over the world -- in Armenia and Afr ica and Israel. I mean, they work for Bibi Netanyahu in his race. So they do the se races and they see which ads work and which processes work best. And we have ideas about what we do over the course of the campaign. I'd tell 'em to you, but I'd have to, you know, shoot you. Hopefully, we'll be successful.
[Laughte r]
CROWD MEMBER: I think one of the aspects about the changes that worked well for Obama four years ago was he promised to bring us more honest, transpare nt government to Washington. I've been around politics for this campaign. I work ed even with Barry Goldwater in 1964, so I've got the oldest Republican [unintel ligible] ... but from what I see, particularly in the last seven months in my ow n personal involvement in the issue, is the government in Washington right now i s permeated by cronyism, outright corruption. ... Our regulatory agencies that a re supposed to protect the public are protecting the people that they're suppose d to be regulating. And I think people are fed up with that. It doesn't matter w hether you are in the Tea Party or Occupy Wall Street. People see that the gover nment is working for the powerful interests and the people who are well connecte d politically and not for the common person, which threatens that whole idea tha t we have this great opportunity, which we should have and have had historically in the West for anybody from whatever background to become successful. One way in which that becomes compromised is when the government is no longer seen as an honest agent and when our tax dollars are not really being put to work for us b ut for the people who are plugged in politically. You know, you have cases like [unclear], which I talk about and am involved in. You have Eric Holder, who is p robably the most corrupt attorney general we've had ever in American history. An d I think it's something, that if spun the right way and in simple terms, can ac tually resonate with the American people. Obama did not keep his promises. Nancy Pelosi, who was supposed to give us an honest Congress, has given us just the o pposite as speaker. And I think that's a campaign issue that can work well. I'm optimistic that you'll be elected president, and my recommendation would be to c lean house immediately ...
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah.
[Laughter]
CROWD MEM BER: The S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. are disaster areas..
MR. ROMNEY: I wish we weren't unionized so we could go a lot deeper than you are actually allowed to go. [To waiter] Am I in the way here? I can say this, and I'm sure you'll agree with this as well. We speak with voters across the country about their perceptio ns. Those people I told you, the 5 to 6 or 7 percent that we have to bring to o ur side, they all voted for Barack Obama four years ago. And by the way, when yo u say to them, do you think Barack Obama is a failure, if they were women, they say no. They like him. But when you say, are you disappointed that his policies haven't worked, they say yes. And because they voted for him, they don't want to be told that they were wrong, that he's a bad guy, that he does bad things, tha t he's corrupt. Those people that we have to get, they want to believe that they did the right thing but he just wasn't up to the task. They love the phrase tha t he's over his head. But you see, you and I, we spend our day with Republicans . We spend our days with people who agree with us. And these people are people who voted for him and don't agree with us. And so the things that animate us a re not the things that animate them. And the best success I have in speaking wi th those people is saying the president's been a disappointment. He told you he 'd keep unemployment below 8 percent. It hasn't been below 8 percent since. Fift y percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job. Fifty percent. Fifty pe rcent of the kids in high school in our 15 largest cities won't graduate from hi gh school. What are they going to do? These are the kinds of things that I can say to that audience that they nod their head and say, ''Yeah, I think you're ri ght.'' What he's going to do, by the way, is try to vilify me as someone who's b een successful, or who's closed businesses or laid people off, and isn't he an e vil, bad guy? And that may work. I actually think that right now people are sayi ng, ''I want someone who can make things better, that's going to motivate me. Wh o can get jobs for my kids and get rising incomes?'' And I hope to be able to be the one to poise that battle. Yeah, please.
CROWD MEMBER: I've seen Obama a lot of times he's done talk shows, interviews. I've never seen you on any of them, and I think a lot of women [unintelligible] ... I think they would see you in a different light. I think a lot of women especially do not watch debates, d o not come to these functions. I think you have to show your face more on TV an d talk like a regular ... like a Smith. I think you could maybe reach a lot of people.
MR. ROMNEY: Well, thank you. I have been on ''The View'' twice now .
[Laughter]
It went very well. I've done the evening shows. I've been on Letterman a couple of times, I've been on Leno more than a couple of times, and now Letterman hates me because I've been on Leno more than him. They're very jealous of each other, as you know. And I was asked to go on ''Saturday Night L ive.'' I did not do that, in part because you want to show that you're fun and y ou're a good person, but you also want to be presidential. And ''Saturday Night Live'' has the potential of looking slapstick and not presidential. But ''The Vi ew'' is fine, although ''The View'' is high risk because of the five women on it , only one is conservative and four are sharp-tongued and not conservative, Whoo pi Goldberg in particular. Although the last time I was on the show, she said t o me, ''You know what? I think I could vote for you.'' And I said, ''I must hav e done something really wrong.''
[Laughter]
I've got to sit down and . .. Darlene, you get the last word.
DARLENE: I was just going to say, I thin k our media strategy would be sending Anne on ''The View.'' She is your best adv ocate, she connects so well, I mean, people talk so much about disconnect and so meone said over there that people use the term ''rich guy,'' and we know that yo u ...
MR. ROMNEY: You know I'm poor as a church mouse!
DARLENE: We kno w that you value [unintelligible] and hard work, but Anne really connects with w omen and she can tell a story and she's the perfect person who can go on Matt L auer and go on Victoria ... and go on ''The View'' and go on all of these people and really get the women connecting to you ... and I think she's a great ...<PA > MR. ROMNEY: I think you're right, I think you're absolutely right. We use A nne sparingly right now so that people don't get tired of her or start attacking .
DARLENE: Who gets tired of Anne?
[Laughter]
MR. ROMNEY: But you will see more of her in the September-October time frame and you know, we had, what is her name, Hilary Rosen, who attacked her and that made Anne much more vi sible to the American people which I think is very helpful. Gave her a platform she wouldn't have had otherwise. And I agree with you, I think she will be extr aordinarily helpful.
DARLENE: Just the people who friended her on Facebook or whatever happened after the Hilary Rosen came out ... that showed you the val ue of social networking and how important new media can be in this election cycl e. And I just think she can be ... and I know she wants you to win.
MR. RO MNEY: She's out there. She's in Texas tonight, she was in Louisiana last night, she's raising money in those places. She was at Ben Crenshaw's house for dinner tonight, isn't that something? So there are some benefits. One of the benefits I get is eating the world's greatest dessert, which I will. Thank you.

HEADLINE: Russia Halting Groups' Access To U.S. Money

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ELLEN BARRY; Steven Lee Myers contributed repor ting from Washington, Rick Gladstone from New York and Andrew Roth from Moscow.$ %

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Russia has ordered the United States to end its financial support for a wide range of pro-democracy, public health and other civil society progra ms here, in an aggressive step by the Kremlin to halt what it views as American meddling in its internal affairs.
The Kremlin's provocative decision to end t wo decades of work in post-Soviet Russia by the United States Agency for Interna tional Development -- with little warning ahead of an Oct. 1 deadline -- was ann ounced on Tuesday by the State Department in Washington. The move stands to cut off aid that currently totals about $50 million a year, a relatively small sum b ut a potentially devastating blow for groups that came to rely on foreign money as domestic controls over politics tightened.
American official s, who were informed of the decision earlier this month, quickly pledged to mane uver around the Kremlin. The Obama administration last October proposed the crea tion of a new $50 million fund-- essentially an endowment for a private foundati on established under Russian law -- for Russian civil society groups, and one se nior administration official said work on that project would speed up. 
The Kremlin has taken a number of actions in recent months to bring pressure on non governmental groups and clamp down on political dissent, including a new law req uiring any organization receiving aid from abroad to register with the justice m anager as ''acting as a foreign agent.'' Russia also increased the penalties for libel and slander -- a step that seemed intended to intimidate critics of gover nment officials.
Russia is not alone in its resentment of United States-le d democracy building efforts. Those have become a sore point for a number of cou ntries in recent years, including allies like Egypt and Pakistan, which have obj ected to outside groups telling them how to run their affairs. The aid agency's cold war history of providing a front for American intelligence agencies is stil l fresh in the memories of foreign officials, many of whom have never fully drop ped their suspicions.
The abruptness of Russia's announcements represents a sour new turn in relations between the countries, which have been touch-and-go since Mr. Putin returned to the presidency in May. While Mr. Putin has rebuffed overtures from President Obama for international action on Syria, he has also p raised him as ''a very honest man'' who could possibly conclude a missile defens e deal in coming years.
Mr. Putin also undoubtedly would prefer to deal wi th the devil he knows rather than the one he does not -- the Republican presiden tial nominee, Mitt Romney, whom Mr. Putin has criticized for characterizing Russ ia as America's greatest geopolitical foe.
Reaction was swift in Washingto n to what was widely perceived as an affront, with Senator John McCain, the Ariz ona Republican, urging the White House to condemn the Kremlin. ''The Russian gov ernment's decision to end all U.S.A.I.D. activities in the country is an insult to the United States and a finger in the eye of the Obama administration, which has consistently trumpeted the alleged success of its so-called reset policy tow ard Moscow,'' Mr. McCain said in a statement.
But the State Department spo keswoman, Victoria Nuland, suggested that if Russia did not want American assist ance, the money could be better spent elsewhere. ''It's their sovereign decision to make,'' she said. ''There are many countries around the world who would like to have more AID funding and help.''
Mr. Putin, facing large-scale dissent at home for the first time, has said unrest is being stoked by the State Depart ment, working covertly through nonprofit organizations.
Among the groups s upported by the money from Washington is Golos, Russia's only independent electi on monitoring group, which last winter enlisted thousands of young Russians as p oll-station monitors and posted reports of vote-rigging on its Web site.
G rigory A. Melkonyants, the deputy director of Golos, said it would take at least a year to find alternate financing to replace the American grants, if it was ev en possible.
''They see us as the source of criticism, and they are trying to halt that source,'' Mr. Melkonyants said. ''Many people are already scared t o talk about the problems that exist today. The press is already frightened. Now they are trying to shut up civil organizations.''
The news filtered throug h Moscow's human rights circles, already battered by new sanctions on political activities.
''What is the list of other countries that have expelled U.S.A .I.D.?'' said Yelena A. Panfilova, the head of the Moscow branch of Transparency International. ''It's not about money -- we can cope somehow -- the problem is about this whole feeling that we have been brought together with Venezuela, Soma lia and Belarus.''
As a practical matter it was unclear how many of the pr ograms could continue without financing or support staff on the ground. The Amer ican aid agency employs 13 Americans in its Moscow headquarters, as well as a Ru ssian staff of 60.
Officials said that the Russian foreign minister, Serge y V. Lavrov, informed Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton of the decision on Sept. 8, when they met in Vladivostok in Russia's Far East during the Asia-Pa cific Economic Cooperation summit meeting.
Formal notice was then sent to Washington, through the American ambassador, Michael A. McFaul, in a memorandum dated Sept. 11, officials said.
The American-financed programs played a cr ucial role in helping Russia recover from the collapse of the Soviet Union, and included efforts to build the country's capital markets and financial system and its mortgage-lending industry. The United States also supported an array of hea lth programs, including efforts to combat tuberculosis and the spread of H.I.V.< PA> But as Russia's economy was buoyed by oil and gas revenues, the agency swun g more than half of its portfolio to democracy and human rights programs, among them prominent critics of government policy. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the programs have cost American taxpayers $2.7 billion, with about one-third of the yearly funding now going to health programs.
In recent years, however , Russia has bridled at the foreign aid flowing across its borders, in part beca use it views itself as a world power, a member of the Group of 8, and therefore more appropriately positioned to dole out assistance than to receive it.
U nderscoring this view, Russia said on Tuesday that it was forgiving nearly all o f North Korea's accumulated foreign debt, which Russian officials have valued at roughly $11 billion, dating back to the closer relationship between them during the Soviet era.
The forgiveness step, which has been in the works for man y months, would help clear the way for Russia to make new investments in North K orea -- a development that runs counter to American-led efforts to economically ostracize the North over its expanding arsenal of nuclear weapons.
Mr. Mel konyants of Golos said he could not understand why American aid agency's work ra nkled the Kremlin so. ''Free elections are not an American goal -- that is absur d,'' he said. ''They are a Russian goal.''

HEADLINE: Mitt Romney, C lass Warrior

 BODY:
It turns out that Mitt Romney was right. There is class warfar e being waged in the 2012 campaign. It is Mr. Romney who is waging it, not Presi dent Obama, and he's stood the whole idea on its head.
When you think of clas s warfare, you probably think of inciting anger, resentment and jealousy among t he have-nots against the haves. That's what Mr. Romney has accused Mr. Obama of doing, but those charges have always been false. The truth is that Mr. Romney ha s been trying to incite the anger of a small slice of the richest Americans who need no government assistance but get it anyway, against the working poor, older Americans, the disabled workers and veterans, and even a significant chunk of m iddle-class Americans. 
That was the message of remarks that Mr. Romney made in May at a private fund-raiser held at a private equity manager's e state in Florida, a moment when he thought he was safe from annoying reporters a nd cameramen, and other Americans who are not rich enough to have bought a ticke t to the event.
A video made public on Monday by the magazine Mother Jones showed a Mitt Romney who felt free to speak candidly about his campaign and how he would conduct a presidency. In that safe zone, Mr. Romney spoke with a bone-c hilling cynicism and a revolting smugness. If he is elected, he said, capital wi ll come back and ''we'll see -- without actually doing anything -- we'll actuall y get a boost in the economy.'' That's the state of trickle-down economics in th e 21st century.
Gone was the pretense that he will be a president of all A mericans. Mr. Romney rather neatly divided the country between the people who ma tter and the 47 percent he does not care about.
To Mr. Romney, that 47 per cent consists of people who do not make enough money to be required to pay feder al income tax. They are freeloaders, he said, ''who are dependent upon governmen t, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsib ility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to fo od, to housing, to you-name-it.'' It is not his job, he said, as a candidate nor apparently as president if he is elected, ''to worry about those people.''
By his definition, those undeserving freeloaders include workers in low-paying , menial jobs (sometimes more than one job) who don't even earn $9,750 a year, t he amount at which they would start to owe federal income tax. Also included are older Americans whose Social Security pensions are too low to be taxed, disable d veterans and people who were maimed on the job.
This group also includes some middle-income Americans who make, say, $50,000 a year but are not required to pay taxes after they take advantage of child credits, marriage penalty relie f and other tax breaks, many of which are part of the Bush-era tax cuts that Mr. Romney backs with a blind ideological fervor.
But, of course, Mr. Romney w as not talking about the Americans who make so much money that they are able to avoid paying any tax at all or who, like him, are able to shelter their incomes in overseas banks or tax loopholes that permit them to pretend that ordinary inc ome comes from investment and thus pay lower taxes. Mr. Romney has been paying, by his own account, about 13 percent to 15 percent of his enormous income in fed eral income taxes. Just compare that with your own tax return.
Everything a bout Mr. Romney's characterization of this mythical slice of lazy, shiftless Ame ricans was wrong. A vast majority of Americans pay federal taxes, either income tax or payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare -- or both -- as well as o ther federal fees. They also pay state and local taxes and sales taxes.
Th e government's revenue problem does not start with the poor but with the richest people, through the Bush tax cuts and other changes. The tax cuts for the riche st people should expire now, and the middle-class cuts should do so eventually. But that will not happen as long as people like Mr. Romney protect the rich by t urning the working poor and middle class into the enemy.
Mr. Romney may hav e been talking about electoral tactics: those people are going to vote for Mr. O bama, so let's concentrate on our kind of people. It's also possible that he was mouthing the words of the extreme right without really believing them. But all the possible explanations say terrible things about Mr. Romney's character.
The right wing has long been whining about people who don't pay taxes and who, therefore, don't deserve a say in government. They have it backward. The shame i s not that those people don't pay income taxes. The shame is how many poor peopl e there are when the top 1 percent can amass uncountable fortunes fed by tax bre aks and can donate tens of millions of dollars to political candidates to keep i t that way.

HEADLINE: Role-Playing TV Ad Stirs Up a Kentucky Race
< BYL>By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
The man wearing a hard hat and jean overalls draped over a neon green T-shirt has his arms folded and stares sternly into the camera. St anding on a graveled railroad track, he speaks bluntly of the decline of the coa l industry as images of Ravenna, Ky., flash across the screen. The blame, he say s, is with President Obama, Representative Ben Chandler, a Democrat from Kentuck y, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
This latest television ad from An dy Barr, the Lexington lawyer running as a Republican to unseat Mr. Chandler, ha s drawn sharp criticism from the incumbent - in large part because the man dress ed as a coal miner is a coal company executive who has contributed thousands of dollars to politicians, mostly Republicans, and has rubbed shoulders with the li kes of Mitt Romney and Karl Rove at fund-raising events. The executive, Heath Lo vell, vice president of River View Coal, does not live in Ravenna or anywhere in the district Mr. Barr is running for. 
"His ad is not only shame fully deceptive, but it's an insult to hard-working Kentucky coal miners who put their lives on the line every day to power our communities and our economy," Er ic Nagy, Mr. Chandler's campaign manager, said in a statement. "Ben Chandler has a long history of fighting to protect coal jobs and ensure the safety of coal m iners, and Barr should be ashamed to use a corporate shill to suggest otherwise. "
Mr. Lovell and Mr. Barr's campaign pushed back forcefully, saying that Mr . Lovell started working in coal mines as a teenager and worked his way up to be come an executive. Mr. Lovell said his father and grandfather worked in coal min es. He still goes into the mine he manages every week, Mr. Lovell said.
"T hat was my hard hat in the video," he said. "That was not some costume that I've put on."
David Host, a spokesman for Mr. Barr, said the idea for the ad wa s conceived during a jobs tour in the spring in which residents of Ravenna told the candidate that their town was once a thriving railroad hub that transported coal, but much of that industry has since vanished. Mr. Barr has blamed that on what his campaign describes as burdensome regulations put in place by the Enviro nmental Protection Agency, backed by Mr. Obama and Mr. Chandler.
Even thoug h Mr. Lovell was not from the area, he was speaking of problems the coal industr y faces statewide that he sees firsthand, Mr. Host said.
"What he has to sa y accurately reflects the sentiments of miners in his mine and across Kentucky, about the war on coal," Mr. Host said. "They're concerned about their future, ab out their jobs. That certainly is something that the ad brings across."
Mr. Chandler's campaign argues that he has been an important ally of the mining ind ustry, advocating for the safety and rights of miners and speaking out against o verreaching regulations.
In the ad, Mr. Lovell stands in front of another m an dressed in miner's clothing.
"Devastating," he says. "Four, five, six a day. Northbound. Southbound. Full rails, full of coal. Now near nothing." He goe s on to say that Mr. Obama, Mr. Chandler and the E.P.A. "are destroying us."
"They're putting the coal industry out of business, and it's just devastating, " he adds. "This is our way of life."
Mr. Lovell and his wife, Lori, have d onated $21,400 to candidates for federal office over the past two years includin g to Mr. Romney and Rand Paul. Mr. Lovell was at a fund-raiser at the home of th e founder of Papa John's Pizza, according to pictures on his wife's Facebook pag e, one of which showed him making a pizza with Mr. Romney.
"Heath and Mitt Romney," Mr. Lovell's wife wrote about the picture. "I am pretty sure this was t he greatest day of Heath's life!"
This is a more complete version of the st ory than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Myanmar's Opposition Leader Urges End to Sanctions

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Thomas Fuller contributed reporting from Yangon, Myanmar.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Myanmar's opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, called for the lifting of American sanctions against her country on Tuesday, beginning an emotional visit to the United States that punctuated the remarkable shift in relations with Myanmar over the past year.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who until recently remained wary of removing the sanctions that have long isolated her country, said they had served their purpose politically, and she urged the United States to engage broadly with the country's leaders to help build a new democracy. 
''I do not think we should depend on U.S. sanctions to keep up the momentum of our new democracy,'' she said at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington. ''We have got to work at it ourselves. There are very many other ways in which the United States can help us to achieve our democratic ends.''
For Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who is widely revered here for her struggle against Myanmar's military leaders, the visit amounted to a political homecoming to a country she had not visited since she worked at the United Nations from 1969 to 1971.
The mere fact of the visit would have been virtually unimaginable even a year ago, when the administration first began to test a political opening after U Thein Sein, a former general, became president and began taking steps to move the country away from its authoritarian past.
''We are not yet at the end of our struggle,'' she said after being warmly applauded by current and former officials when she arrived at the institute, accompanied by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, ''but we are getting there.''
The Obama administration has already significantly eased sanctions against Myanmar, also known as Burma, allowing American companies to invest in many areas of the economy. But it has left other sanctions in place -- with even suspended sanctions remaining on the books -- to guard against what Mrs. Clinton described on Tuesday as the risk of ''backsliding'' by hard-liners.
''There are forces that would take the country in the wrong direction if given the chance,'' said Mrs. Clinton, who met with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi at the State Department on Tuesday morning. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi did not specify which sanctions she wanted lifted. One of the most punitive restrictions left in place is a ban of virtually all Burmese imports to the United States.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is scheduled to have a series of public and private meetings with administration officials, lawmakers and democracy advocates. The White House has not announced whether she will meet with President Obama.
She will receive Congress's highest honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, in the Capitol's Rotunda on Wednesday, four years after she was awarded it in absentia while under house arrest.
Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi first met last December at the lakeside villa in Yangon where the democracy advocate spent 15 years under house arrest. They have since remained in regular contact as the United States has returned an ambassador to the country and taken other steps to restart something close to normal relations.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was released from house arrest in November 2010 and earlier this year was elected to Parliament, appears to have closely coordinated her trip with Myanmar's new government, in contrast with a recent trip to Thailand that seemed to cause some strain in the relationship with Mr. Thein Sein, the president. She invited a government minister who is close to him, U Aung Min, to accompany her on Wednesday to the ceremony in Congress.
Mr. Thein Sein, who has surprised many by his willingness to ease restrictions on political parties, the news media and businesses, has made lifting sanctions one of his highest priorities, and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's remarks on Tuesday here underscored the extent of their collaboration. Both are scheduled to be in New York next week during the annual opening of the United Nations General Assembly.
While they are not exactly allies, their relationship is considered crucial to stabilizing Myanmar as it makes the transition from military dictatorship to a more open, if not yet democratic, system.
''Both sides are reaching out to each other,'' said U Tin Maung Thann, the president of Myanmar Egress, an organization that works with the president's office. He noted that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi had invited Mr. Aung to the Capitol Hill ceremony and that they consulted with each other on the color of their outfits.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi arrived in Washington the day after Mr. Thein Sein's government announced the release of 514 prisoners, the latest in a series of amnesties that have included some, but not all, political prisoners.
The release of some political prisoners in a larger amnesty was in keeping with what American officials have said was a strategy by Myanmar's government to avoid a blanket release that could anger the country's hard-liners. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners in Burma, an advocacy group, said it considered only 86 of those freed in the latest round to be political prisoners.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said that in a democracy there should be not a single prisoner of conscience, but she also showed her openness to compromise. For example, although the military government changed the country's name to Myanmar, democracy advocates and the United States continue to refer to it by its old name, Burma. She said she now accepted both and sometimes used ''Burma'' because she was accustomed to it.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi also described the work of her bloc in Myanmar's Parliament. She and 42 other members of her party initially refused to take an oath of office to protect a constitution they do not consider fully democratic, but she explained at length why she ultimately relented.
''We are beginning to learn the art of compromise, give and take, the achievement of consensus,'' she said. ''It is good that this is beginning in the legislature, and we hope that this will spread out and become part of the political culture of Burma.''

HEADLINE: Romney Stands Behind Message Caught On Video

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and ASHLEY PARKER; Reporting was contributed by Michael Barbaro from Salt Lake City, Michael Shear and Jennifer Steinhauer from Washington, and Trip Gabriel and Nicholas Confessore from New York.

 BODY:
Mitt Romney on Tuesday fully embraced the substance of his secretly recorded comments that 47 percent of Americans are too dependent on government, saying that his views helped define the philosophical choice for voters in his campaign against President Obama.
''The president's view is one of a larger government; I disagree,'' Mr. Romney said in an interview on Fox News. ''I think a society based on a government-centered nation where government plays a larger and larger role, redistributes money, that's the wrong course for America.''
The comments were Mr. Romney's attempt to find some benefit in the political furor after the disclosure of statements he made at a closed fund-raiser in Florida in May, where he spoke of nearly half of Americans who pay no federal income taxes and, in his analysis, would never vote for him.
Those are people, he said at the fund-raiser, who are ''dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them.'' 
Mr. Romney, who on Monday called the remarks inelegant, suggested on Tuesday that it was time for a full debate about dependency, entitlements and what his campaign characterized as a long history of Mr. Obama's support for ''redistributionist'' policies.
But despite the effort by Mr. Romney to take the offensive, his campaign spent the day working to keep the episode from becoming a turning point in a campaign that until now has remained neck and neck, and trying to minimize the damage from the disclosure of another set of remarks from the fund-raiser, in which he suggested that a two-state solution for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians -- longstanding United States policy -- was not feasible.
Some Republicans applauded Mr. Romney's determination not to back away from his statements about taxes and entitlements, which echo themes promoted in recent years by many conservatives, including Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan. Speaking to a Nevada TV station on Tuesday, Mr. Ryan echoed Mr. Romney's line of attack on Mr. Obama and government dependency, though he said Mr. Romney's comments were ''inarticulate.'' But the developments gave Democrats new ammunition to make their case that Mr. Romney is out of touch with the needs and values of the middle class and does not understand the economic forces at work in many families.
It also left some Republicans distancing themselves from Mr. Romney's remarks. And it forced the Romney campaign to adopt a new message just a day after starting an ad campaign built around different themes, as officials closely monitored whether donors were growing more nervous about the management of Mr. Romney's candidacy and his prospects in November.
In an appearance on ''Late Show'' with David Letterman, Mr. Obama accused Mr. Romney of ''writing off a big chunk of the country'' and said it would be wrong for a politician to ''suggest that because someone doesn't agree with me that they're victims or they're unpatriotic.''
In the editing bays of the pro-Obama ''super PAC'' Priorities USA Action, producers were finding ways to splice bits of Mr. Romney's commentary at the fund-raiser into videos and television advertisements, a sign that the recordings will provide the Democrats fodder until Election Day.
Two Republican Senate candidates in hard-fought races in the Democratic territory of the Northeast, Senator Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts and Linda McMahon of Connecticut, disavowed the remarks. ''Not the way I view the world,'' Mr. Brown said; ''I disagree,'' Ms. McMahon said.
Even some conservative intellectuals argued with Mr. Romney's description of the 47 percent of people who do not pay income taxes as Obama voters. They noted that among that 47 percent were potentially Romney-supporting ''seniors, who might well 'believe they are entitled to health care,' '' as the Weekly Standard editor William Kristol wrote, and ''lower-income Americans (including men and women serving in the military) who think conservative policies are better for the country.''
Mr. Romney effectively ceded that point in his interview with Neil Cavuto on Fox News, saying he was referring instead to ''those that are dependent on government and those that think government's job is redistribute -- I'm not going to get them.''
The tension of the moment spilled out in unguarded moments with Mr. Romney's aides, one of whom likened the situation to a circus. Two advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity in separate interviews, expressed frustration that the comments at the fund-raiser -- held at the Boca Raton, Fla., home of the financier Marc Leder -- played into the image that Democrats have promoted all year of Mr. Romney as uncaring about average voters and concerned only about himself and his wealthy friends.
Mr. Romney's campaign organized back-to-back conference calls to reassure donors, featuring a coterie of top advisers -- Matt Rhoades, the campaign manager; Spencer Zwick, the finance director; and Beth Myers and Ed Gillespie, both senior advisers. One of the calls, with Mr. Romney's national finance committee, was moved up from its usually scheduled time near the end of the week, and on the second, larger donor call, the campaign urged the donors to ''have at it.''
Later on Tuesday, National Review reported that Mr. Romney had faced such a cash shortage while awaiting the ability to spend his general election money that he had to borrow $20 million in August to get him through the end of his convention. The money was easily covered by his general election account.
Mr. Romney's aides said that they were keeping perspective in a way that the news media ''feeding frenzy'' was not. A Gallup daily tracking poll that had shown Mr. Obama with a growing edge after the Democratic convention effectively had the race as a tie on Tuesday, though an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday night showed the president with more of an edge and with his approval rating reaching the 50 percent mark.
While Mr. Romney's aides played down the significance of the recordings, they said they were most unwelcome because they yet again kept Mr. Romney from getting back to his message on the economy, delivering a clearer sense to voters of where he would lead the nation.
''Every day that he is not talking about jobs he is losing an opportunity to draw a contrast with the president's abysmal record on the economy,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. Referring to Medicare and Social Security, she said she feared that his comments at the fund-raiser would paint him as being against ''earned programs that people pay into'' and have ''widespread support.''
''He has just not brought sufficient clarity to what his vision for America is,'' Ms. Collins said.
Throughout the country Republicans reacted with a mix of trepidation and defiance. Joe Gruters, chairman of the Republican Party of Sarasota, Fla., said he believed it would ''play into his strength,'' while Steve Armstrong, chairman of the Linn County, Iowa, Republicans, called it ''an unfortunate mistake.''
Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said he believed that Mr. Romney would ultimately win the argument on substance, but cautioned that Republicans need to show that ''they are concerned about every American.''

HEADLINE: Past Forward: Why Students Still Want to Get Into 'Hot' Colleges

BYLINE: MAYA LAU


HIGHLIGHT: Years ago, it was UVA, Stanford, and Vanderbilt. Now, the "hot" colleges include Harvey Mudd, the College of Charleston, and Elon. What's your definition of a "hot" college? 

 BODY:
Harvey Mudd. The University of Richmond. The College of Charleston. Elon. They may be unfamiliar names to many, but according to Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz, a college admissions counselor and the author of "Admission Possible: The Dare to Be Yourself Guide for Getting Into the Best Colleges," they are all examples of schools that "have suddenly come into the hot scene" for high-school seniors applying to college, something they're working at right now (most early-admissions deadlines are Nov. 1).
What do we mean when we say a college is "hot"? And why do we care about hotness anyway? Michael Winerip, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, author of "Adam Canfield, The Last Reporter" and creator of the new Booming blog at The Times, took up these questions in 1984. In his article for the magazine, "Hot Colleges and How They Get That Way," Winerip described what many ambitious high-school students (and their parents) were thinking in the mid-'80s:
In an unsure economy, they see a "hot'' college as a good investment. Hot colleges lead to hot professional schools, which lead to hot careers and, presumably, hot lives.
One of the "hot" schools mentioned by Winerip 28 years ago happened to be the University of Virginia, the subject of Andrew Rice's cover story in last weekend's Education Issue, which, according to its recently-fired-then-rehired president, "still ranks as one of the best public universities in the country." Another school that appeared in Winerip's article was Brown, reported to have had "a policy to eliminate grinds and nerds" from being admitted in favor of "outgoing, confident and positive" applicants. Students cited factors like pleasant weather (Stanford) or having "their own ski slope" (Dartmouth) as part of what made colleges "hot" in their minds.
I asked Tessa Adler, a senior at Point Loma High School in San Diego, what she considers to be the hot schools. "People in California always mention U.C.L.A., Berkeley and U.S.C.," she said. But Adler's criteria for the right school include snow, a fairly small student body and a strong science program. She is considering places like Yale, Brown, Middlebury, the University of Denver, Washington University and Bowdoin. She had contacted me to ask about my alma mater, Vassar, another place she is considering, and agreed to be interviewed for this post. I assumed, based on the other schools Adler is interested in, that she would also like Williams College in Massachusetts. I was wrong. "It seems too handholdy there," said Adler, who visited Williams. "There were posters in the hallways with little-kid phrases like 'You Can Do It!'" When people at the college described the emphasis on freshman counseling and bonding, it struck Adler as "more like baby-sitting than college."
Shaevitz - who advised me years ago when I was applying to college - says that in her 20 years of experience, she "didn't see the panic" around finding the right college until the economic downturn in 2008. "Then it became so palpable that it was like the permanent elephant in the room."
I asked Winerip to revisit his article, now that nearly three decades have passed, and give me his reaction. "The first surprise is I was right," Winerip wrote to me. "Second, it could have been written today. . . . All the insanity we have attached to the process was as true then as it is now." He went on:
When I wrote this, I saw things as the students did - I'd just graduated college in 1974. Now I see it as a parent who's watched my four children go through it. My heart goes out to these kids, it's terrible to put them through this. On the other hand, I've also come to realize how much less important all this is. One of my children was lost for a while, dropped out of college, made mistakes, came home to live, then took classes at the local community college. There, he fell in love with learning, graduated and was accepted to a top university. There are so many ways to get where we're going.

HEADLINE: The iPhone and Consumer Spending

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: American economic data can be misleading because it recognizes the contribution of researchers at the wrong stage of the development process, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. 
That the introduction of iPhone 5 increases consumer spending is no triumph for Keynesian economics, but merely an advertisement for plans by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to improve national accounting.
Suppose there were an island economy with 100 able-bodied adults, all of whom work as fisherman, each catching a fish a day. The 100 fish are eaten by the island people, which makes inflation-adjusted daily consumer spending in the economy - or consumption, as economists call it - equal to 100.
(In order to clarify concepts and measurement practices, I have deliberately kept this model economy simple, with no unemployment, liquidity traps and the like.)
Now suppose that 10 of the fisherman decide to quit fishing to build, nurture and tend to an apple orchard. In the beginning, the orchard produces no apples, so consumer spending drops to 90 fish a day, because only 90 adults are out fishing while the other 10 are developing an orchard.
Time passes, and a bountiful 100-apple harvest occurs. Because the apples taste good, the island fishermen obtain all 100 apples from 10 orchard owners in exchange for fish. The apple harvest has by itself boosted consumption in the economy, which suddenly jumped from 90 fish a day to 90 fish a day plus 100 apples.

It would be ridiculous to proclaim that the apple harvest and its effect on consumer spending prove that the economy is plagued by a liquidity trap, or to insist that the immediate effect of the harvest on consumer spending is independent of the quality of the apples. By construction, this model economy has no Keynesian features, yet nonetheless a harvest has a large effect on measured consumption.
Consider now the American economy, in which Apple has just released its iPhone 5, and some economists say they believe that the release itself will noticeably increase aggregate consumer spending. Paul Krugman has gone even further, to assert that the increase is a proof for Keynesian economics and that the "short-run benefits from the new phone have almost nothing to do with how good it is."
Even if Keynesian economics were completely wrong, economists would expect the iPhone 5 release to cause consumer spending and gross domestic product to be greater than it was before the release, to a degree related to the phone's overall value to consumers. Note that, as in my island economy, the development of Apple products reduces consumption before the release, because the people working on the coming products are not available to produce consumer goods during that time.
Much of the development work on the iPhone 5 did not, before its release, count as investment or G.D.P. (G.D.P. is the sum of public and private consumption and public and private investment). The national accounts treat research and development activities as intermediate inputs, which means that they are subtracted from revenue for the purpose of determining a corporation's contribution to national production.
This same is true for, say, Apple's legal expenses in developing patents (many of which are discussed on the Mactech Web site) and license terms for their new product.
These development activities appear as G.D.P. only when the product is completed and sold. If the product is not valuable, it will not sell and will not count for much, although national consumption could still rise if upon project completion the developers move out of development and into the production of consumer goods.
(Research and development employees usually receive wages during the development phase, but their prerelease compensation comes out of corporate profits).
For the purposes of understanding the timing of economic activity, the national accounts' treatment of research and development is a weakness, because it recognizes the developers' activity at the wrong time - only after the product is released. Economists at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (the agency producing our nation's accounts) are aware of this weakness, how it has become acute with the rise of the technology sector and steps they might take to improve the accounts. They are doing the best they can with the data and economic research results that are available.
Measured consumption rises in the quarter when people buy their new iPhones, not when they actually use them (in my island model, the consumption would be measured when the apples are bought, not when they are eaten). IPhones are durable goods that are used for years after Apple sells them as new, including by second and third owners.
Curiously, the timing of measured iPhone consumption would be markedly different if Apple or cellular carriers had chosen to rent the phones rather than sell them, because the measured consumption would occur each month when users paid their rental fees (the Bureau of Economic Analysis is aware of this weakness and rectifies it in sectors where it is most acute, like the housing sector).
The iPhone 5 release is no occasion to cheer for wasteful government spending, but perhaps does help make the case for a larger budget at the Bureau of Economic Analysis, so that it can continue its progress on measuring the amount and timing of economic activity.

HEADLINE: The Meaning of the China-Japan Island Dispute

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: As violence and threats mount in the East China Sea, what will be the lasting effects of the struggle between China and Japan? 

 BODY:
BEIJING - Oh, the irony. This was supposed to be the "Friendship Year of Japan-China People to People Exchanges," marking 40 years of diplomatic ties between the World War II enemies.
What we're seeing, instead, is deepening dislike, even hatred, over ownership of a clutch of islands in the East China Sea.
With the U.S. defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, in town talking about the dispute with his Chinese counterpart, and violent anti-Japanese - sometimes anti-foreign - demonstrations sweeping China, how concerned should the world be?
The short answer: pretty concerned, though more for long-term than short-term reasons. As Deng Yuwen, an editor at Study Times, a magazine run by the Communist Party's Central Party School, wrote in Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao newspaper, being nationalist in China is "politically correct," and the government has long relied on a muscular nationalism to bolster its legitimacy. Read the article, reposted on Chinese-language web sites.
That makes anti-outsider sentiment in China a deep force that could, in theory, be turned against any neighbor. And China has territorial disputes with many neighbors - Japan, but also Vietnam, the Philippines and India (over the state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as part of Tibet.)
But first, the immediate background: starting last weekend, government-tolerated demonstrations have taken place in scores of cities in China, with cars and department stores burned and Japanese-style shops smashed as people protested against the purchase last week by the Japanese government of three of the Diaoyu (as China calls them) or Senkaku (as Japan calls them) islands. Japanese citizens here are frightened to go out. Electronics giants like Panasonic and Canon have shuttered production in local factories, the popular clothing retailer Uniqlo has closed many stores and hundreds of Japanese-style eateries and businesses, including 7-Eleven (it is Japanese-owned in China), were shut. Political visits between Japan and China are canceled and even operas and writers' meetings are off.
On Tuesday, thousands of angry Chinese marched again in Beijing and Shanghai against Japan. As my colleagues Ian Johnson and Thom Shanker wrote from Beijing, the protests were highly organized but also crudely threatening, not just towards Japanese, but towards foreigners in general.
"One banner showed a Chinese soldier castrating a Japanese soldier, while a popular image depicted Japan's national flag as a white sanitary napkin with a spot of blood in the middle," Ian and Tom wrote.
"Some foreigners were queried about their nationality, with Americans lectured for their country's military alliance with Japan. Foreign men were asked if they had Chinese girlfriends."
What is going on?
While the surface factors are complicated enough - conflicting territorial claims where both sides arguably are right, because they base their arguments on the logic of different historical periods - what is really worrying about the anger in China is how it is rooted in nationalism encouraged by the government, commentators, both Chinese and foreign, say.
Right-wing nationalism in Japan is a major inflammatory factor. The last time Chinese demonstrated on this scale against Japan was in 2005, over the whitewashing of Japan's World War II crimes in Japanese history textbooks. Western diplomats blame Japan for this current round of tension, which began in April when the nationalist governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, announced the city was considering buying the islands from the family that owned them. (The Japanese government's purchase last week aimed at calming tensions by keeping them out of Mr. Ishihara's hands. Judging by the reaction, it didn't work.)
Equally, the reaction on the Chinese street is highly flammable. And that's related to nothing less than a question of the legitimacy of the ruling Communist Party, wrote Mr. Deng: "For a long time, the legitimacy of the Chinese government has been based on two things. 
"One is high-speed economic growth. The other is patriotism and nationalism," with the government long encouraging a virulent brand of nationalism, he wrote. Today, slowing economic growth is weakening the government's legitimacy, and "the Chinese government very possibly may become increasingly dependent on nationalism and patriotism," he wrote.
This all makes other countries feel insecure and untrusting towards China, "the result of which may be that China antagonizes everyone in the international arena and there will be endless friction," he wrote.
Mr. Panetta, meeting with the Chinese Defense Minister, Liang Guanglie, spoke openly on Tuesday about American concerns: "With respect to these current tensions, we are urging calm and restraint by all sides and encourage them to maintain open channels of communication in order to resolve these disputes diplomatically and peacefully," Reuters reported.
The United States has cause for concern because if violence does erupt - and with a flotilla of Chinese fishing boats allegedly headed for the islands right now, it's unclear what may happen - then it may be implicated, via its military treaty with Japan.
Parts of the Chinese government and state-run commentariat understand the risks to China of an increasingly bellicose stance on the world stage. Over the last days, too, there has been a spate of calls in state news media for "rational" patriotism, such as some of these in the Global Times, which urged Chinese to "not turn to the dark side."
But as the economy slows further, people are wondering: how far will the government turn to nationalism to strengthen its own legitimacy? Or is China's overall economic rise strengthening that sentiment anyway, leading to a broad disregard for its international image? And is the possibility of conflict creeping closer in Asia?

HEADLINE: The 47 Percent May Struggle but the Top 20 Percent Are Feeling Flush

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Mendelsohn Affluent Survey 2012, subtitled "The State of the Affluent Consumer," analyzes the 59 million Americans who live in households with $100,000 or more in annual income. 

 BODY:
There has been a lot of talk about the 1 percent, the 47 percent, the 99 percent or whatever slice of the population is lately in the spotlight.
On Wednesday, we had some research on the 59 million Americans who live in households with $100,000 or more in annual income - the Mendelsohn Affluent Survey 2012, subtitled "The State of the Affluent Consumer," which was released by Ipsos MediaCT.
The results of the survey, which has been conducted for 36 years among affluent Americans, are scrutinized by marketers, media companies and advertising agencies for clues on how best to peddle goods and services to people with money.
The affluents, as they are called in the survey, make up about a fifth of the total population; the subset of the ultra-affluents, in the survey's parlance, who make $250,000 or more a year, is roughly 2 percent of the total population.
Although affluent Americans "don't feel as affluent as perhaps they did in the mid-2000s," Stephen Kraus, senior vice president and chief insights officer at Ipsos MediaCT, said during a presentation of the survey, there are still "opportunities" to engage with them.
For one thing, Mr. Kraus said, affluent Americans seem interested in "re-engagement with the marketplace," meaning they are considering shopping and spending again after some pauses and cutbacks.
For another, some affluent consumers are interested in indulging themselves and splurging on non-necessities, he added.
A third opportunity identified by Mr. Kraus was a willingness among the affluents to open their wallets and purses if "they see value in spending more to get quality."
Indeed, the luxury segments of many consumer product categories have held up well considering the recent global economic woes.
In studying affluent consumers by age, the survey found the largest group, 39 percent, are baby boomers, followed by Generation X, at 33 percent; millennials, at 20 percent; and the elderly, at 8 percent.
In addition, Mr. Kraus said, 8 percent is Hispanic; 7 percent Asian-American; 6 percent African-American; and 3 percent lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.
A closely followed part of the annual Mendelsohn survey is its information about the media consumption habits of affluent Americans. The 2012 version of the study suggests they have an almost bottomless appetite for media.
As ownership of smartphones and tablet computers soars among the affluents, according to the survey, those wealthy consumers are pretty much turning to the traditional media as much as they have in the past. So television, radio, magazines and newspapers seemingly have little to fear - at least for now - from cannibalization by new media, the survey indicates.
For instance, even as ownership of tablets in affluent households rose to 47 percent this year from 14 percent last year, Mr. Kraus said, and the number of hours online each week climbed 14 percent, print media remained "very much an important part" of the lives of such consumers.
The reach of traditional print media is being augmented by apps, he added, as 4.7 million affluent Americans downloaded apps this year, about twice as many as last year.
And the "hard-copy readership" of six national daily newspapers actually rose 3.9 percent from the previous survey, Mr. Kraus said. (The newspapers are The Financial Times, Investor's Business Daily, The New York Times, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.)
Still, the interest in new media among the people rich enough to buy innumerable gadgets cannot be underestimated.
For example, the percentages of respondents who said they visited or used social media within the previous week were still growing in the 2012 survey. For Facebook, the percentage rose to 63 percent from 58 percent. For LinkedIn, it rose to 18 percent from 13 percent.
And for Twitter, the increase was 50 percent, to 12 percent from 8 percent.

HEADLINE: The Next Generation at Goldman

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Goldman Sachs may be readying the next generation of leaders. | Apple closed above $700 a share for the first time. | The new 1,004-foot tower known as One57, in Midtown Manhattan, may be the new haven for billionaires. 

 BODY:
The Next Generation at Goldman | Goldman Sachs is passing the torch to the next generation, as the investment bank announced that the longtime chief financial officer, David A. Viniar, would retire in January and Harvey M. Schwartz would take over.
The move may be the first sign that Goldman is readying the next generation of leaders. The change also prompted speculation about the succession plan for Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, and whether Gary D. Cohn, the firm's second-in-command, is next in line. Kate Kelly of CNBC tweeted: "New Goldman CFO Schwartz is tight with Gary Cohn. Could signal that Cohn is solidifying power base, might actually succeed Blankfein."
Mr. Schwartz will step into the role at a relatively stable period for Goldman, which has emerged from the financial crisis relatively unscathed and avoided some of the latest scandals. As the Deal Professor writes:
"The remarkable story will be that Goldman, despite the controversies it has faced, has put itself in a position to not only profit but continue its dominance. It's a case study in business survival and reputational repair."
Still, Goldman faces its share of challenges. On a conference call on Tuesday, the analyst Mike Mayo noted that Goldman's stock price was still relatively low, as investors fret over new regulations and the economic outlook. Mr. Viniar, who owns about $225 million of Goldman shares, said, "As C.F.O., Harvey will be able to get the stock price higher than I have been able to."
IPhone Frenzy | Apple closed above $700 a share for the first time. The technology giant is riding the wave from the iPhone 5, which has generated strong sales and decent reviews. As The Washington Post notes, it's a somewhat "arbitrary" milestone that represents "little more than a nice round number and a record high trading level." But then again it's Apple, the most valuable public company in the world. And even at $700 a share, it's not overvalued, argues Felix Salmon of Reuters.
The Billionaires' Building | The new 1,004-foot tower known as One57, in Midtown Manhattan, may be the new haven for billionaires, The New York Times reports. According to The Times: "The buyers of the nine full-floor apartments near the top that have sold so far - among them two duplexes under contract for more than $90 million each - are all billionaires, Gary Barnett, the president of the Extell Development Company, the building's developer, said this week." Mr. Barnett added that the group includes some "significant Forbes billionaires."
Even owners at 15 Central Park West, the Robert A. M. Stern-designed tower that is home to big Wall Street names like Lloyd C. Blankfein and Daniel S. Loeb, are buying into One57, according to The Times.
On the Agenda | The bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach, of DoubleLine Capital, who recently expressed an interest in equities, is on CNBC today at 11 a.m. Andrew Mason, Groupon's chief executive, is on CNBC at 1:30. (With the stock down 11 percent over the past two days, one wonders if Mr. Mason will be his usual wacky self.) Steve Case, the investor and AOL co-founder whose firm, Revolution, raised a venture capital fund last year, is on Bloomberg TV at 6. William Blair, the investment banking and asset management firm, is hosting its 15th annual private equity conference in Chicago on Wednesday and Thursday. Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, is having a private meeting today with the Senate Finance committee, to discuss policy issues related to the "fiscal cliff."
Help for Housing | Economists have been hopeful that the housing market is on a slow and meandering path to recovery. Data released today include housing starts, out at 8:30 a.m., and existing home sales at 10 a.m. 
The housing market could eventually get a lift from new bond purchases by the Federal Reserve, which Mr. Bernanke announced last week. But it's not clear those moves will actually help lower mortgage rates. DealBook's Peter Eavis wrote on Tuesday that pricing on home loans has "gotten stuck." He wrote: "The banks aren't fully passing on the low rates in the bond market to borrowers. Instead, they are taking bigger gains, and increasing the size of their cut."
Coming to Market | The I.P.O. markets are facing another test, and the early results don't look good.
Japan Airlines, making a return to the stock market after a $4.4 billion bailout, raised $8.5 billion in an offering, marking the biggest debut since Facebook. But the carrier failed to sustain investors' enthusiasm when it began trading in Tokyo on Wednesday. It closed barely above its offering price, Hiroko Tabuchi reports for DealBook.
In the United States, Trulia, the real estate search site, is set to price its I.P.O. on Wednesday. The company plans to sell 6 million shares at a price of $14 to $16 a share.
The Romney Fumble | Despite the latest gaffe by Mitt Romney, some Wall Street types don't think the race is over. Given the moribund economy, Dan Greenhaus of BTIG told Business Insider that Mr. Romney should be leading in the polls. "The notion that his campaign is dead is not shared by everyone," said Michael Block of Phoenix Partners.
The Republican presidential candidate's latest headache - the video showing him at a fund-raising event talking dismissively about "47 percent" of voters - has dragged another financier, Marc J. Leder, into an uncomfortable spotlight. Mr. Leder, of the private equity firm Sun Capital Partners, hosted the event earlier this year. On Tuesday, his spokesman issued a statement, according to Fortune:
"I hosted a fundraiser for an old friend in May. I believe all Americans should have the opportunity to succeed, to improve their lives, and to build even better lives for their children. I have supported people from both political parties who share this view and make it a priority, even though their ideas on how to achieve it may differ."

HEADLINE: The Breakfast Meeting: More 47 Percent Fallout and a Diller-Rudin E-Book Venture

BYLINE: THE EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Also, a French magazine is ordered to stop publishing Kate Middleton photos; and after losing to Apple in court Samsung goes after it in print. 

 BODY:
The now-infamous 47 percent video - secretly taped at a Mitt Romney donor event in May - is still reverberating in media circles as well as political ones.
Mother Jones, which posted the full version of the video Tuesday, enjoyed one of its best days online, according to Clara Jeffery, one of the magazine's co-editors. James Carter IV, the unemployed researcher who helped bring the video to light, received a congratulatory note from his grandfather, the former president Jimmy Carter. (Earlier, Ben Smith at BuzzFeed chronicled the video's long strange trip to Mother Jones.)
President Obama had a public opportunity to respond to the video during his appearance on "Late Show" with David Letterman, saying that Mr. Romney "was writing off a big chunk of the country." As Bill Carter reports, the host also managed a reference to Clint Eastwood's performance at the Republican National Convention and "got an immediate laugh by noting the empty spot next to the president and asking: 'Is there anything you want to say to the empty chair?'" 
Barry Diller, the chief of IAC/InterActiveCorp, and Scott Rudin, the Broadway and Hollywood impresario, are getting into the e-book business. The pair have teamed up with Frances Coady, a publishing industry veteran, to invest in The Atavist, the Brooklyn-based electronic book publisher. The new venture, called Brightline, will look to eventually publish physical books as well.
Apple, which has aggressively gone after its rivals in commercials like "1984" and its series of "Mac vs. PC" ads, is now on the receiving end. Samsung, which recently lost a billion dollar patent case to Apple, has been taking direct aim at the new iPhone in a series of print ads, including one with the headline "It doesn't take a genius." On the blog Gizmodo, Apple fans immediately began retaliating with their own parodies based on the Samsung ads, one with the headline "Don't settle for cheap plastic."
The magazine Closer, which recently published topless photos of Kate Middleton, has been ordered by a French court to stop all distribution of the pictures and to hand over the originals to the royal family.
Also in France, the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo has published cartoons mocking the prophet Muhammad, setting off another wave of protests in the Middle East. In New York ads calling Islamic jihad "savage," will soon appear in subways after a federal court ruled that the transit authority could not refuse the ads, which were purchased by the American Freedom Defense Initiative, a pro-Israeli group.
NBC's hit show "The Voice" will add Usher and Shakira as stand-in judgeswhile two of the show's biggest stars, Christina Aguilera and Cee Lo Green, take one season off to record and tour.
And Steve Sabol, for years the creative force behind NFL Films, the revered and much satirized chronicler of the football league, has died at the age of 69.

HEADLINE: Distortion in Tax Code Makes Debt More Attractive to Banks

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: Banks use more debt than equity to finance their activities because a tax break makes the debt cheaper and encourages banks to gorge on more. 

 BODY:
Thanks to a leaked video, we know that Mitt Romney divides the country into those who pay taxes and those who don't, the makers and the moochers.
There is one perhaps surprising group you can put in the latter category: the nation's banks. Sure, banks pay taxes, but they pay a lot less thanks to a giant and underappreciated distortion in our nation's tax code. Moreover, this tax code distortion makes the financial system and the economy more fragile, prone to bankruptcies and runs. Banks profit, and the economy teeters. Great bargain, huh?
It's the tax code's favoring of debt over equity.
 For businesses, debt interest payments are tax deductible; equity payments, like when a company pays out a dividend, are not. At the margin, this encourages entities to take on more debt than they otherwise would, as Steven M. Davidoff noted in a Deal Professor columnearlier this year. More debt not only makes companies more vulnerable to bankruptcy but also makes investors more susceptible to panics, when they withdraw their capital en masse. More equity would make the world more stable.
"The worst thing the tax code can do," says Victor Fleischer, a tax specialist at the University of Colorado, "is to make it harder to use a sensible capital structure." Mr. Fleisher, a contributor to The New York Times DealBook, testified in front of Congresslast year about this problem.
This distortion is well known. President Obama, in his tax reform proposal, mentioned it, though he didn't make any specific proposal about what to do about it. The Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, is proposing substantial tax cuts with the loss of revenue made up with the closing of loopholes. He has yet to specify any of those loopholes, but corporate debt interest deductibility hasn't been in the conversation.
What isn't well appreciated is how much the debt deduction helps the banks. The first way is direct: Banking is a highly leveraged industry. Banks use more debt than equity to finance their activities. The tax break makes the debt cheaper and encourages banks, at the margin, to gorge on more.
Financing techniques that have become more popular in recent decades benefit from this distortion. Bundling of debt, like credit card receivables or mortgage debt, called securitization, turns out to give banks a tax bonanza. For accounting purposes, banks are typically able to treat their bundling of this debt as a sale. But for tax purposes, banks often get to call it debt. Those payments to the buyers of the securitizations' bonds are therefore tax deductible to the bank.
More important, there's an indirect and unremarked benefit. Banks help companies raise money in two main ways: through the sale of stock (equity) and debt, either through loans or the sale of bonds. When a company goes public, selling stock for the first time, the underwriting banks make more money than they do for a comparable debt offering. But banks make it up on volume with debt. Bonds expire. Companies issue more of them all the time.
Partly because of the tax code distortion, corporate debt is underpriced and overconsumed by the bank's corporate customers. Indeed, the debt business dominates the world of investment banking these days. When corporations raise more debt compared with equity, that fattens bank profits.
Then, too, the trading of debt is more profitable than the trading of equity. Stocks are traded on transparent markets at transparent prices. Debt is traded in opaque ways, where the spread between the offered and requested prices is wider than for stocks. That means more profit for investment banks compared with stocks, whose trading spreads have narrowed for decades. So, too, with derivatives and securities based on debt - things like collateralized loan obligations.
And these complex debt securities give society - what? The system we have subsidizes the middleman to create dubious products. Those products help the middlemen - the banks - but they make the financial system more fragile. So the tax code distortion doesn't just lead to more debt in corporate America and more leveraged banks. It also helps create a finance-heavy economy where the banking sector accounts for a bigger proportion of gross domestic product and corporate profits than it otherwise would. Granted, the tax code is far from the only force in American society that creates a larger financial sector or overleveraged corporations. But it's one of the least recognized.
As most of us have come to understand since the financial crisis, having a bigger finance industry than necessary wastes resources. Banking is supposed to provide capital to help companies create real goods and services, not be an end unto itself.
As it is, lawyers, accountants and investment bankers spend thousands of billable hours analyzing transactions to figure out if there are ways to treat them like debt, rather than equity.
Are there solutions to this distortion?
There are two choices: reduce or eliminate interest deductibility or introduce some deduction for equity.
Neither seems particularly feasible for some time. Reducing the deductibility would be elegant but generate screams of bloody murder from corporate America.
Making dividend payments tax deductible, which would start to level the playing field, might be easier and more popular. Of course, that would reduce revenue to the government and have to be made up somehow, though tax increases elsewhere or decreased services.
Mr. Fleischer suggests that one way to limit the distortion would be to eliminate the deduction to the extent a financial institution exceeds a ratio of debt-to-equity of 5 to 1. If a bank has borrowed $6 for every $1 in stock, then it doesn't get to deduct the interest payments on that extra dollar of debt. That would make debt more expensive and make banks less inclined to borrow as much.
And it would help stop banks from being moochers.

HEADLINE: Class, Politics, and the 47 Percent

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: It's misleading to suggest that the country splits evenly into income-based voting blocs. 

 BODY:
Among the many fallacies in Mitt Romney's now-infamous "47 percent" speech is that "people who pay no income tax" will "vote for the president no matter what." More than one-fifth of non-filers are elderly, a constituency likely to favor Mr. Romney.
But even assuming Mr. Romney only had non-elderly, low-income voters in mind, it's misleading to suggest that the country splits evenly into income-based voting blocs, with the poor and the working-class automatically favoring Democrats, and vice versa.
This is, or ought to be, obvious. Lots of ink has been spilled examining why working-class Americans are willing to vote against their economic interests.

Gallup reported yesterday that "while income is correlated with voter support, it is by no means a total determinant of vote choice." Voters with annual household income below $24,000 prefer Mr. Obama, 58 to 34; and voters with annual household income above $180,000 prefer Mr. Romney, 52 to 43. But that's as stark as it gets. The $60,000 to $90,000 group breaks for Mr. Romney, 49 to 46, while the next step up, $90,000 to $120,000, breaks for Mr. Obama by the same margin, 49 to 46.
A June Pew survey found that Americans are more divided along partisan lines than at any point in the last 25 years, but observed "neither growing class differences in fundamental political values, nor increasing class resentment." Class identification is not synonymous with party identification.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Blocks Veteran Jobs Bill

BYLINE: LAWRENCE DOWNES


HIGHLIGHT: Patty Murray, the bill's sponsor, said many Republicans won't acknowledge that "the treatment of our veterans is a cost of war." 

 BODY:
Veterans won't be getting a new, billion-dollar jobs program, not from this Senate. Republicans on Wednesday afternoon blocked a vote on the Veterans Job Corps Bill after Jeff Sessions of Alabama raised a point of order - he said the bill violated a cap on spending agreed to by Congress last year. The bill's sponsor, Patty Murray of Washington, said that shouldn't matter, since the bill's cost was fully offset by new revenues. She said Mr. Sessions and his party colleagues had been furiously generating excuses to oppose the bill, and were now exploiting a technicality to deny thousands of veterans a shot at getting hired as police officers, firefighters and parks workers, among other things.
The vote was 58-40; the bill needed 60 votes to proceed.

It would be easier to admire the Republicans' late-breaking fiscal scrupulosity if their motives - denying the Obama administration any kind of victory this year, whatever the cost to jobless vets - weren't so transparent. It's probably useful to remind Republicans like John McCain (a "nay" on the jobs bill) that wounded, jobless and homeless veterans aren't a fact of nature. They're a product of the wars that Congress members voted for, the war debt they piled on, and the economy they helped ruin.
"It's unbelievable that even after more than a decade of war, many Republicans still will not acknowledge that the treatment of our veterans is a cost of war," Ms. Murray said in a statement after the vote.

HEADLINE: Romney Says He Can Help the Poor

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican candidate tries to confront the notion that he is not the candidate of the poor and others who are economically challenged. 

 BODY:
ATLANTA - Mitt Romney on Wednesday confronted the most damaging perception from a secretly taped video: that he had written off those who rely on government assistance.
"The question of this campaign is not who cares about the poor and the middle class," Mr. Romney told campaign donors here during a fund-raiser.
 "I do," Mr. Romney said. "He does," he added, referring to President Obama.
"The question is who can help the poor and the middle class. I can! He can't!" Mr. Romney said.
His remarks appeared intended to blunt his word choice during a fund-raiser in May, when he declared that 47 percent of Americans believed that they were "victims" and were too beholden to the government to ever vote for him.
Since video of that fund-raiser has become public, Mr. Romney has said that he spoke inelegantly, but he has stood by his words.
At the fund-raiser on Wednesday, Mr. Romney kept up his assault on Mr. Obama for his seeming to say in a 1998 interview that he believed in the concept of wealth redistribution.
America, Mr. Romney said, "does not work by a government saying, become dependent on government, become dependent upon redistribution. That will kill the American entrepreneurship that's lifted our economy over the years."

HEADLINE: Misinformed Monetary Mitt

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Some guy told him something, so it must be true. 

 BODY:
Leave aside what the now-famous video tells us about Mitt Romney's character; in a way the shocking thing is how uninformed he seems to be. The 47 percent number was the kind of thing you hear in yahoo forums like talk radio and the Wall Street Journal editorial page; and then there's what he said about US debt.
Kevin Drum makes the catch:
[A]s soon as the Fed stops buying all the debt that we're issuing-which they've been doing, the Fed's buying like three-quarters of the debt that America issues. He said, once that's over, he said we're going to have a failed Treasury auction, interest rates are going to have to go up. We're living in this borrowed fantasy world, where the government keeps on borrowing money. 
Has the Fed been buying anything like three-quarters of the debt that we're issuing? Here's a comparison between two numbers: the increase in the value of federal debt held by the public (which in this case includes the Fed), and the increase in Fed holdings of federal debt, in each case measured over the previous year:
So there was a period when the Fed was buying a large fraction of federal debt issue -- but it didn't last long. Many people did believe that terrible things would happen when the Fed stopped -- among them Bill Gross. And you know what? They lost a lot of money, because the Fed bond purchases came to an end but interest rates kept going down:
And yes, I called this one right. But that's not crucial here. What is crucial is that a sort of urban legend developed that the only thing keeping rates low was the Fed; this legend was proved wrong by events; but Mitt Romney still believes it.
And why does he believe it? Because he talked to some guy.
Look, Romney is a presidential candidate. He has a staff, and some prominent economists allegedly advising him. Yet he draws his stories about the economy from what he heard somewhere, apparently believing that if the right sort of person says something there's no need to check it out.
Awesome.
