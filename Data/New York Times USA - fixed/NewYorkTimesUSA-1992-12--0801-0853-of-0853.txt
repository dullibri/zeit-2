HEADLINE: Talks With China Mean Jobs for U.S.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Are These Trips Necessary?" (editorial, Dec. 19): Several weeks ago President Bush asked me to lead a Presidential mission to China, following his decision to resume high-level economic talks with the Chinese. The driving rationale for the mission was to promote economic growth and jobs in the United States by insuring that American businesses have the support and opportunity to capitalize on the booming Chinese market, growing at 12 percent a year. 
 Unfortunately, much of this message seems to have been lost on critics, who use the cost, timing and makeup of the mission to attack the President's China policy. Simply put, though, President Bush's policy of constructive engagement is a long-term investment in our economic future and is already delivering results in China and in the United States.
To see this, we need only look to the many American workers at A.T.&T. involved in manufacturing digital switching and other telecommunications equipment for export to China or the hundreds more at Boeing who will benefit tremendously from the recently announced sale of some $800 million in aircraft to China.
The interagency delegation I led to China and Hong Kong came back with almost $1 billion in business, and more important, we made it abundantly clear to the Chinese that they must address our concerns over the growing trade imbalance between China and the United States.
The Bush Administration is mindful of human rights and weapons proliferation concerns in China and elsewhere. I made that point to Prime Minister Li Peng and other senior Chinese Government officials with whom I met. However, we have a responsibility to American companies and to this country's working men and women. That responsibility, to fight for American jobs, must not end, even during the transition between the Bush and Clinton administrations. That, sir, is my job until Jan. 20.

HEADLINE: A New Amity, A New Treaty;
Most Threatening Sort Of Weapon Is Banned

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29

 BODY:
In completing a new strategic arms treaty, Washington and Moscow have for the first time agreed to bring their strategic nuclear arsenals into line with their new cooperative relationship.
Throughout the cold war, each side amassed an expanding arsenal of strategic weapons. But the agreement will drastically cut the size of each side's arsenal and, most important of all, ban the most threatening type of nuclear weapon -- the land-based missile with multiple warheads.
 
Removing the Hair Trigger
 Despite the waning of the nuclear threat brought about by the end of the cold war, the agreement on the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was not inevitable. And it was a testimony to the difficulty of the Start II negotiations that the final hurdles were not overcome until this week, six months after President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin announced that they had reached a basic agreement on the treaty at a June summit meeting in Washington. 
 Nor does the warming in American-Russian relations mean that the accord is unnecessary or insignificant. By eliminating Russia's land-based multiple-warhead missiles, the Russians' strong suit in strategic weaponry, the treaty will take the hair trigger off the arms race. It will also make it difficult for the Russian military to rebuild its arsenal if Mr. Yeltsin and his reformist Government are overthrown and replaced by a hard-line administration -- no small concern to Washington.
"If things go well, the treaty provides a framework to make drastic reductions over the next decade," said Walter B. Slocombe, a senior Pentagon official during the Carter Administration and an expert on strategic arms. "If things go badly, it will take the Russians that much longer to go back to a larger force."
 
Ukraine the Biggest Problem
 Yet for all of the celebrating in Moscow and Washington, there are still serious political obstacles to be overcome before the agreement can be put into effect. Both Moscow and Washington have made clear that they cannot begin to carry out even the earlier Start I pact, which was approved by the Senate in October, until Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan agree to forgo their nuclear arms and sign the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.
Of the three, Ukraine is the main problem. Though the Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, has promised to carry out the Start I terms, some members of Parliament, uneasy about their Russian neighbor, have indicated an interest in hanging on to some nuclear arms. It will probably take American funds, some type of assurance that the West will not turn a blind eye to Ukraine's security and continued American pressure to convince the Ukrainians to part with the strategic arms.
 
Last Hurdles Resolved
 The main provisions of the treaty are stunning to those who followed the steady growth of strategic weapons throughout the cold war.
The accord will slash the superpowers' arsenals to a third of their current size. The American arsenal will be cut to 3,500, while the Russian missiles and bombs are to be reduced to 3,000. The reductions are to be carried out by 2003, but the deadline for carrying out all the cuts can be moved up to 2000 if Washington is willing to provide Moscow with economic and technical assistance to hasten the destruction of the Russians' weapons.
The last remaining hurdles, which were swept away at this week's talks in Geneva, concerned several Russian demands intended to lower the cost of complying with the accord. One was a demand that the Russians be allowed to convert, rather than destroy, some of their SS-18 missile silos so they could be used by a smaller new missile under development. That issue was resolved by allowing the Russians to keep 90 of the 154 SS-18 silos that they will have after the Start I terms are carried out.
To insure that the silos cannot be quickly reconverted for use by banned SS-18 missiles, the Russians agreed to pour five meters of concrete on the floor of the silos; the initial American negotiating demand was 13 meters. Moscow also agreed to put a metal ring on the top of the silos that is smaller than the SS-18's circumference.
Another obstacle was overcome when Washington agreed to let the Russians covert 105 of their remaining 170 six-warhead SS-19 missiles to single-warhead missiles instead of developing a costly new single-warhead missile. To guard against the possibility that the Russians might cheat by adding additional warheads, the Russians will have to permit inspection of the warheads, American officials said.
To placate the Russians, the Americans agreed to a one-time inspection of the B-2 Stealth bomber, though the United States will be allowed to cover its more sensitive components with shrouds during the inspection.
 
Signing in Bush's Term
 American officials privately acknowledged that the compromises might not have been accepted in Washington when the American-Russian relationship was marked by distrust and suspicion. But Administration officials said the White House was willing to relax its negotiating demands to help the cash-strapped Russians save funds and to insure that Start II was ready for signing on Mr. Bush's watch.
For all of its accomplishments, however, there are some things the agreement does not do. It does not require the destruction of the nuclear warheads on the missiles, or of the nuclear materials inside them.
The excess nuclear warheads and the abundance of nuclear material in the former Soviet Union has become a major worry, as the West tries to stem the spread of nuclear weapons to Iran, Iraq and other third world nations.
That Start II fails to address this problem suggests that it is foremost a vehicle for codifying the end of the cold war and less a means for grappling with the emerging arms control agenda, which will now have to be tackled by the Clinton Administration.

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 29

 BODY:
After immobilizing two crew members, the pilot of a Cuban commuter plane on a brief domestic flight diverted the craft to Miami International Airport this morning, and all but 5 of the 53 people on board immediately requested political asylum.
The incident, which comes as political and economic conditions in Cuba have sunk to their lowest level since Fidel Castro seized power 34 years ago, is believed to be the first in which a Cuban commercial flight was commandeered and brought to the United States.
 
Hijacking or Freedom Flight?
 Its arrival had United States officials scrambling to find a legal justification for what the Cuban Government today called a "terrorist act" engineered by Washington. The officials are reluctant to take legal action against the pilot of what they regard as a freedom flight but what Cuba says is a hijacking. 
 Jubilant Cuban exile leaders here said that because the pilot, who has been identified as Carlos Cancio Porcel, voluntarily brought the plane here, his action may not constitute a hijacking as defined in international agreements that both Cuba and the United States have signed.
But Federal officials here and in Washington seemed confused as to how they should treat the spectacular mass defection, and they declined to discuss any legal issues that might be involved. The local office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service said it would have no comment on the incident and referred all questions to the United States Attorney's office. A spokesman in that office said only that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was looking into the matter "for possible violations of U.S. laws."
Bureau agents today were interviewing the 4 crew members and 49 passengers, who included 11 minors. "We are trying to gather facts as to whether this was in fact a hijacking," said Lucie Vonderhaar, a bureau spokeswoman. "We don't even know if it is our jurisdiction. If there was in fact a hijacking, then it will be our jurisdiction."
United States Customs investigators and other officials who had spoken to people aboard the flight described an incident that was well planned and executed. They said they were told that shortly after the plane took off from Havana for the northern beach resort of Varadero early this morning, Mr. Cancio, aided by some passengers, arranged for the co-pilot to be lured into the main cabin. There, they said, the co-pilot was tied up and silenced.
 
Subdued With Chloroform
 At the same time, they said, a security agent who was on board was subdued with a handkerchief soaked in chloroform and then was handcuffed. Meanwhile, another pilot sitting among the passengers reportedly went into the cockpit to assist Mr. Cancio in flying the plane 175 miles northward to Miami.
"The pilot was a prime participant and instigator of this effort," said Michael Sheehan, a spokesman for the United States Customs Service. "There was obvious preparation and participation by some other people on board the plane, but we do not know how many."
Spanish-language radio stations here quoted Cuban exile leaders as saying that Mr. Cancio's wife, two sons and several of his wife's relatives were among the passengers.
The pilot's voice was heard on Spanish-language radio in a comment to reporters as he was led away by Federal agents for questioning. "I'm very happy to have been able to ridicule the Communist system of Cuba," Mr. Cancio said. "This was a very complicated maneuver, one that was a year in the planning."
Chris Mangos, a spokesman for Miami International Airport, said the co-pilot and the security guard, who was taken to a local hospital for treatment, had asked to be repatriated to Cuba. He said three others, identified as a stewardess and the wife and daughter of the co-pilot, had also asked to return. Federal officials said they would be allowed to leave as soon as possible.
Dan Gelber, a spokesman for the United States Attorney here, said that the 38 adults who requested asylum today would be held at an immigration service detention center while their situation was sorted out. The 10 minors with them, he said, are eligible to be handed over "to relatives or friends," and 3 were released around 11 P.M.
Federal officials said the twin-engine turboprop, a Russian-made Antonov A-26 operated by Aero-Caribbean, a government-owned airline, left Havana around 8:30 A.M., bound for Varadero, about 75 miles away.
Anne Eldridge, a spokeswoman for the southern regional office of the Federal Aviation Administration, said that "around 9 A.M. the pilot contacted Miami air traffic control, identifying himself as Aero-Caribbean 360, inbound to Miami." At 9:18, she said, "we received notice from Havana that there was a plane that said it was being kidnapped to the United States," and about two minutes later the plane landed without incident.
After the passengers and crew emerged from the plane, the pilot and co-pilot engaged in a brief shoving and punching match on the tarmac, airport employees said. The co-pilot, Rolando Vila, was handcuffed and led away, but the police said he was not under arrest.
Airport employees also said that the security agent, Andres Hernandez Ledesma, appeared to be woozy and unsteady as he descended the ramp.
But some passengers were smiling and slapping each other's hands in the air in high-five signals as they emerged from the plane. Escorted by F.B.I. agents and other Federal officials, Mr. Cancio later emerged from the customs office to inspect the plane and raised his arms in triumph. One passenger, a young boy, ripped up what appeared to be a Cuban identity card before he went into the customs office.
The mass defection comes less than two weeks after a daring rescue of family members by a former Cuban Air Force pilot who had defected in his MiG-23 jet in 1991. The pilot, Orestes Lorenzo, landed a small plane on a highway outside Varadero, where he picked up his wife and two children and flew back to Florida with them.
Today's defection, however, was said by Cuban exile leaders to be the first instance in which a regular commercial flight was successfully diverted to the United States.
Normally, when Cubans arrive here by boat, they ask for political asylum and almost automatically receive it. But there was apparent confusion in officials' responses to questions about the status of the Cubans who arrived today. Under international accords, the plane will be returned to Cuba, probably within a week, officials said. The accords require signatories either to punish or extradite hijackers and to return passengers.
Cuban exile leaders said they thought it unlikely Mr. Cancio would be prosecuted for hijacking, since he was authorized to fly the plane and merely diverted the craft from its regular route. They also noted that President Bush met with Mr. Lorenzo in the White House last week in what they took as a tacit endorsement of such escapes.
And United States officials, while still researching legal documents for language on hijackings that might describe the diversion, said they could imagine no circumstances under which Mr. Cancio and those who helped him would be forced to return to Cuba.
"If the majority of the people want to go, can you really say it was hijacked?" asked a Federal official who spoke on condition he not be identified.

HEADLINE: Yugoslav Premier Ousted by Foes 6 Months After Return From U.S.

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Dec. 29

 BODY:
Communists and nationalists combined forces in the federal Parliament today to oust Prime Minister Milan Panic. The move apparently ended the short but highly unusual political career of Mr. Panic, an American citizen who many in the West had hoped would somehow take power and end the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The overwhelming no-confidence vote in the Parliament followed the election of Dec. 20, when Mr. Panic, a Serbian-American millionaire from California, failed in his effort to unseat Yugoslavia's most powerful political leader, President Slobodan Milosevic of the Serbian republic. He was in fact routed by Mr. Milosevic in the elections. 
 It is one of the paradoxes that Mr. Milosevic originally supported Mr. Panic's premiership, and encouraged him to move from California, where he ran a pharmecutical company. Mr. Milosevic had hoped that Mr. Panic, with his American ties, would persuade the United Nations Security Council to lift economic sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia in May for its support of Serbian attacks in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
But during his six-month tenure, the 63-year-old Mr. Panic consistently attacked Mr. Milosevic and other militant Serbian nationalists, calling for peace and compromise solutions to the war in Bosnia and the greater Yugoslav crisis.
At first, Mr. Panic's attacks were regarded with skepticism in the West by those who thought they were orchestrated by Mr. Milosevic. But eventually, he was taken seriously, and Washington made it clear in the last month that it was backing Mr. Panic's efforts.
Late today, Parliament voted to name Radoje Kontic, a Deputy Prime Minister in Mr. Panic's administration, to head an interim Yugoslav Government.
Mr. Panic told Western reporters after the vote today that he would stay in Yugoslavia to organize intellectuals and students opposed to Mr. Milosevic and the other nationalist leaders, who have brought this country international isolation, economic chaos and threats of military intervention.
"I still have responsibility toward the country," Mr. Panic said. "We are headed toward disaster if we do not correct this."
"The country desperately needs help to reach political maturity," the former Prime Minister said. "I am planning to assist in that."
"I am going to try very hard to organize the Yugoslav intellectuals and students," he said before lashing out at parliamentary representatives from the Socialist Party of Serbia and the nationalist Serbian Radical Party, who ended his premiership in lopsided votes in both houses of Parliament today.
"The total responsibility for the failure of Panic's Government is on that Parliament," Mr. Panic said, accusing Socialists and Radicals of shackling the Government's hands. "This group is trying to put the responsibility on me."
In a speech to Parliament's upper house today, the Radicals' leader, Vojislav Seselj, said Mr. Panic was a foreign agent who should be jailed for embezzlement and for acting against the interests of the Serbian people.
"We are convinced Mr. Panic will end up in jail," Mr. Seselj said. "Some Government members are honorable and honest, but there are also traitors, especially Milan Panic."
Mr. Seselj, who commands a party militia that has fought in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, has been named by the United States Government and human-rights groups as a suspected war criminal.
Western diplomats said Mr. Milosevic's Socialists and the Radicals undertook Mr. Panic's ouster in an attempt to quash any possiblity that the former Prime Minister might become a rallying point for people opposed to the nationalists ruling Yugoslavia.
"It cuts Panic to the ground and encourages him to move out of Yugoslavia," a diplomat said. "It also puts the icing on the cake of Milosevic's victory and takes a step toward preventing Milan Panic from becoming a rallying point for the Serbian opposition."
The successful no-confidence vote was the third serious attempt by Radical Party members to oust Mr. Panic.
Mr. Panic, who reportedly over the weekend sent home virtually his entire Serbian-American staff, traveled the world for months lobbying for the lifting of the economic sanctions against Serbia, arguing that the former Yugoslavia's largest republic has been unfairly singled out as the guilty party in the Bosnian war and that the economic embargo is punishing everyday people instead of the Milosevic government.
The ebullient former bicycle racer, whose off-beat style and sharp humor brought smiles even to his opponents, rankled Mr. Seselj and other Serbian nationalists by becoming the first Serbian official in years to meet with the leaders of the majority ethnic-Albanian community of Kosovo, a tense region in southern Serbia whose postwar autonomy was quashed by Mr. Milosevic and his supporters.
Mr. Panic also irritated the nationalists by signaling that his Government might recognize Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina within their present borders, a move that would create international frontiers between Serbia and the large Serbian populations in the other former Yugoslav republics.
Backed by the Yugoslav Army, Croatia's and Bosnia and Herzegovina's Serbs went to war rather than acquiesce to becoming minorities in the two countries.

HEADLINE: MAN IN THE NEWS;
Inheritor of Tarnished Presidency: Itamar Augusto Cantiero Franco

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Dec. 29

 BODY:
Moments before Itamar Franco took the oath of office today to become the new President of Brazil, he handed senators a piece of paper on which he had listed his personal net worth and properties.
It was well-timed gesture, intended to indicate that his Government would not partake of the corruption and bribery that led to the resignation of his predecessor, Fernando Collor de Mello. And many who know Mr. Franco say they do not expect such problems in his Government. 
 But if the 62-year-old, silver-haired politician is going to take hold of this huge country of 150 million people and raise it out of recession and near-hyperinflation, he will need more than a clean government.
In the three months since he has been the Acting President, following the impeachment of Mr. Collor on Sept. 29, Mr. Franco has generated as much concern as he has confidence.
 
Economic Policy Debate
 Many have accused him of sending out conflicting signals and advocating an economic policy that will do little more than fuel inflation and prolong the recession.
"He is a 1950's populist nationalist who is lost in the 1990's," Roberto Campos, a conservative member of the Chamber of Deputies, said in a recent interview.
Mr. Franco has said repeatedly that he wants to concentrate government policy on aiding the very poor of Brazil, and he has called for a doubling of the minimum wage to $100 a month, from $50 currently.
When criticized in the press for appointing a Finance Minister with no international standing, he shot back that Brazil "needs to forget a little about New York, Manhattan, and think about its slums, its suffering people."
"What is modernity?" he asked. "Is it defending foreign interests, or defending interests of our country?"
 
Some Economists Worry
 Such statements concern many economists, who worrying that he will return to state interventionism, rather moving Brazil toward free markets.
"I will not permit my government to be influenced by the markets," he once said.
He has not presented a specific economic program, but he is expected to do so on Wednesday in his first presidential speech.
Some Franco ideas have already emerged. He has said he will fight inflation by selling Government enterprises and by raising taxes, thus creating less pressure on the Brazilian central bank to print money to cover Government deficits.
But tax increases are likely to only continue the current two-year recession, and Mr. Franco has placed enough obstacles in the way of privatizations that many say they will be brought to a halt, despite assertions by his Planning Minister, Paulo Haddad, that by March 1993 the Government would sell 12 state companies. In late November, Mr. Franco personally suspended the sale of one state company.
The issues he faces in Brazil are the focus of a policy debate that rages throughout Latin America -- how to get the Government out of business and reduce inflation while trying to lift the growing number of poor people out of the ranks of poverty.
 
Leader's Popularity Grows
 But what was unmistakable today was that for now he is a popular leader of Brazil, as the country breathed a sign of relief that Mr. Collor had been removed from the political scene.
In the Chamber of Deputies today, during the swearing-in ceremony, scores of young people, representing a youth movement that helped push Mr. Collor from office, cheered the new President from the galleries, and with repeated waves he acknowledged their support.
Recent polls show that his popularity is growing in Brazil, with an approval rating of 60 percent compared with 54 percent in November.
For this politician from the industrial south-central state of Minas Gerais, it will be a feat to manage the conflicting parties of Brazilian politics. However, he is certain to draw on political alliances forged during the 16 years he served in the Senate before he became Mr. Collor's running mate in 1989.
 
Born Aboard Ship
 Itamar Augusto Cautiero Franco was born on June 28, 1930, aboard a ship sailing off the coast of the northern state of Bahia. His father died around the time of his birth, and his mother was a seamstress. Mr. Franco grew up in Minas Gerais and graduated as a civil engineer from the Federal University of Juiz de Fora.
He began his political career when he was elected mayor of Juiz de Fora in 1967. After serving two terms, he was elected to the Senate in 1974.
He is divorced and the father of two grown daughters.
Though with an outward gentle demeanor and polite, associates say he has a fiery temper and is easily offended. During one Cabinet meeting he asked one member who was looking at his watch too much to leave the room.
Mr. Franco is author of some 19 published works ranging from discussions on nuclear energy to short stories. He has also admitted to being superstitious. In a gathering with reporters on Friday the 13th of November, he said it was necessary to exorcise ghosts from the Presidential Palace.
But some who know him say he needs a good economist rather than a good exorcist. Some who have attended economic policy meetings have said they were surprised by Mr. Franco's lack of grasp of the issues.
"People say that explaining economic policy to the President is like going to a level below Economics 101," said Alexandre Barros, a political consultant in Brasilia.

HEADLINE: Kenya Votes, a Mirror Perhaps of Democracy in Africa

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAKURU, Kenya, Dec. 29

 BODY:
With the country's political stability hanging in the balance, millions of Kenyans voted today, their first broadly contested election in nearly a quarter-century.
President Daniel arap Moi who has ruled for 14 years, faces seven challengers. In the race for Parliament, about 700 candidates are contesting the 188 seats in the single house. Results are expected on Wednesday. 
 There were no immediate reports of major violence or irregularities. But many feared that the calm would not last beyond today, especially if, as many expect, Mr. Moi wins a narrow victory and the vote is seen as having been fraudulent.
What happens in Kenya is considered an important test of whether Western-style multi-party politics will continue to take hold in sub-Saharan Africa. Over the last few months, the pace of democratic upheaval in Africa's authoritarian, single-party governments has slowed, and in some cases, such impetus toward change has gone into reverse.
Angola's elections in September, for instance, were followed by a resurgence of fighting between the Government and Jonas Savimbi's insurgent movement, which was defeated at the polls. Earlier this month, Nigeria's military rulers postponed a return to civilian democracy scheduled in January, asserting that this was necessary because of increased economic hardship, corruption and new political tension.
 
Accusations That Echo
 Elections in Ghana and Cameroon have been bitterly denounced by newly legal opposition parties who say they were beaten only because the balloting was rigged by the governing party, a charge often heard in Kenya.
Indeed, in the final days of the campaign here, political debate was largely overshadowed by allegations of bribery and cheating, outbreaks of violence and intensified ethnic rivalry.
Some Kenyans say this growing ferment may spur voters toward Mr. Moi, who has campaigned on themes of stability and continuity, arguing that the opposition is riven with personal rivalries and is incapable of single-mindedly governing the country.
Still, by African standards, Kenya's political turmoil seems manageable. Unlike Nigeria or Zaire, there is little talk here of military officers pressing their own agenda and sweeping the civilian authorities from power. Nor, for the most part, are Kenya's economic problems so dire that the prospects of change seem hopeless. Kenya remains arguably one of the continent's more stable and prosperous countries.
But there are problems just below the surface, the most immediate being repeated charges of financial misconduct. While corruption in Kenya is not thought to have reached the level of plunder attributed to, say, Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire, it has been a continuing liability for Mr. Moi.
This was driven home last year when most Western donors, including the United States, declared that they would suspend or reduce aid, charging continuing financial malfeasance in the Moi Government. Whether or not such aid will be restored is expected to depend on popular perceptions of whether the balloting today and vote-counting tonight were by and large fair.
Today, in lines of voters in several towns, those willing to express their views provided a portrait of an election that revolved more around regional and ethnic allegiances than on the critical issues facing Kenya.
In Kikuyu, a town 10 miles northwest of Nairobi that, as its name indicates, is a stronghold of the Kikuyu, Kenya's biggest ethnic group, Peter Ngugi, a bus conductor, expressed anger at Mr. Moi and the ruling Kenya African National Union for economic incompetence and corruption. "Moi's a dictator; he's ruined this country," Mr. Ngugi said, adding: "There's no way that Moi can win. And if he does, there'll be trouble."
Strong anti-Moi sentiments were voiced here in Nakuru, a province capital in the Rift Valley. In recent months, large numbers of people in these lush farmlands have been killed in tribal-related outbursts.
For the most part, the attacks have involved members of the Kalenjin, President Moi's small tribe, which over his 14 years in power has become the ruling elite, against largely defenseless members of bigger ethnic groups. In explaining their votes, many here offered opinions similar to that of Martin Nakitare, a hotel employee, who said: "Voters need change because of the violence. And it's all being caused by Moi and his henchmen."
But Philip Muriuki, a 47-year-old mechanic, said he had voted for the President precisely because he is a strong leader who tolerates little dissent. "When you compare Kenya to Somalia or Ethiopia," he said, "you have to admit that at least we're at peace. You have to give Moi credit for that."

HEADLINE: Elderly Share a Home, and Their Warmth

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SYOSSET, L.I.

 BODY:
As usual, Mary Daniels, who is 88, started rinsing the dishes as Mike Stenson, 81, scraped the remains of the meat loaf and mashed potatoes into the garbage, and the others, amid considerable chatter, cleared the table and prepared tea and dessert.
The others, that is, except Bill Mahoney, 72, who stayed seated, drumming his fingers on the table in Harvest House, a Long Island group home for the elderly. "There's too many cooks in there," he said, a bit defensively. "When I cook, I like to cook alone." 
 "When you cook," observed his buddy Joseph Donovan, 90 years old, as he deposited a stack of ceramic dessert plates on the table, "it's a miracle."
The tiny society of Harvest House, a powder-blue clapboard home where six elderly people and one nun who acts as manager eat, sleep, banter and occasionally squabble together, is an experiment in communal living for old people. The house is part of the emerging patchwork of long-term living alternatives for the growing number of elderly Americans.
For the relatively healthy elderly, shared housing is slowly catching on nationwide as it overcomes ingrained notions about the importance of keeping such people as "independent" -- which can mean as lonely -- as possible.
"We're talking about changing a mind set to get people to do this," said Margaret L. Harmon, co-director of the National Shared Housing Resource Center, a nonprofit organization in Burlington, Vt., that advocates group housing. "We've got to try to give permission for people to be more interdependent as opposed to being independent."
Ms. Harmon estimates there are 450 shared-housing programs around the country, up from at most 100 in 1981. On average, monthly rents are between $350 and $400.
Only some of those programs run group homes like Harvest House. There are other, less communal forms of shared housing. On Staten Island, Richmond Senior Services puts together two or three people 60 and older and places them in apartments or condominiums with private rooms and common kitchens at average monthly rents between $275 and $325.
Even more common are home-sharing arrangements that match an elderly homeowner with someone who pays little or nothing toward household expenses in return for company, security and help around the house. In Manhattan and Brooklyn, the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens has paired 266 older people with guests.
The group houses require a larger step into the unknown by the elderly person. Strangers, all with decades of being set in their ways behind them, give up familiar homes in familiar neighborhoods to live together like freewheeling college students with summer jobs.
But the house mates say it makes economic sense for them. Each person in Harvest House pays $804 a month for rent, utilities and food. Group housing also encourages residents to eat regularly and keep up their appearances. And it can be an efficient way to care for elderly people who need a small amount of help, with grooming, bathing or medication, since one home-care worker can tend to several at the same place.
Most group houses are owned by nonprofit organizations, which are exempt from some taxes, Ms. Harmon said. Harvest House and Harvest Grove, its sister home in Lake Grove, L.I., are owned by the Emmaus House Foundation, a nonreligious, nonprofit organization.
Unlike an apartment after a spouse dies, or a nursing home where the smell of antiseptic can hang like death in the halls, Harvest House is not a lonely place where the aging kill time. Recently, it smelled of pine from the Christmas tree, smoke from the fireplace and meat loaf from the oven. Residents clearly relish the camaraderie. Despite varying educations and careers, they have much in common, given their years and that all but one are widowed.
"They know, being their age, what it is to lose people and have hurts, so the way they support each other is wonderful," said Sister Jeanne Brendel, the 64-year-old nun in blue jeans who fought all the way up to State Supreme Court eight years ago to force the Town of Syosset to accept Harvest House. Zoning rules can be an obstacle to group housing. In this town, the rules forbade several people not related to one another by blood or marriage to live together.
 
'The Fit' Was Easy'
 According to the house mates, they had little difficulty achieving what Jim Slavin calls "the fit."
Mr. Slavin, 85, Harvest House's resident scholar, was the director of unemployment insurance for the New York area when he retired from the State Department of Labor in 1975. After his wife of 55 years died a few years ago, he moved into a nursing home. He stayed one month.
"That hotel warehoused old people and I didn't want that," he said.
For those who choose to live together, Mr. Slavin said, the trick to getting along is to be willing to compromise and to respect others' privacy.
"You have to give away some of your independence, knowing you're doing it for your own development," he said. "There are always things that are very small and very private, where you have to moderate your disposition to make the fit."
But sometimes, like family members everywhere, residents quarrel over small things, when someone leaves the toothpaste open or the toilet seat up, Sylvia Wiser said. Ms. Wiser, vice president of the Shared Housing Association of New Jersey, is a counselor in some of the 19 group homes in the state. "They're the kinds of things we're used to, but these are people who have lived alone for a long time," she said.
While the residents of Harvest House gather at 5 each evening for drinks and then dinner, they all have their own rooms to retreat to. And they all go about their own business. Mr. Slavin takes long walks through town, listens to books on tape and attends study groups on topics like "Art and Faith." Mr. Stenson, who emigrated from Ireland in 1949 and worked as a mechanic's helper in upper Manhattan, likes to till the garden, although he is no longer strong enough to plant potatoes. Mr. Mahoney volunteers in the community and, as the only resident with a car, functions as chauffeur for the others.
Keeping one's privacy can also mean keeping some secrets. Sister Jeanne still does not know which one telephoned a local cable television call-in program when she appeared and asked to speak to Dr. Ruth. But she's pretty sure it was Mr. Mahoney.
At Harvest House, the group tries to keep residents as long as possible. Of the original group of eight, Sister Jeanne said, four lived there until they died or until a heart attack or pneumonia put them in the hospital for a brief, final stay.
One resident, Anna Waldinger, had a weak heart. "She must have been in the hospital three times and came back and just recouped," Sister Jeanne said. Last year, she died in her sleep at the house.
If Ms. Waldinger had required the help of a nurse for more than a few days, however -- had she become bedridden and required someone to bathe her, for example -- Sister Jeanne would have got in touch with her family and tried to find her a new home that provided more care.
Once a resident leaves, the bonds don't vanish. When Mr. Slavin was hospitalized for two months last summer for a risky operation to correct his myasthenia gravis, a disease that attacks the nervous system, his house mates visited him regularly.
"You'll have someone to grieve for you when you die from here," Mr. Slavin said. The pictures of those who have died remain on one wall.
New residents tend to find the house through word of mouth, they said, which may help explain why all the present house mates are Roman Catholics of Irish extraction.
Sister Jeanne, whose order is the Sisters of St. Dominic of Amityville, said a major impediment to homes like Harvest House is fear of anything that sounds like an institution.
But absent the gray-haired people, one would have to hunt a bit for clues that Harvest House, with its swimming pool, VCR and stereo (on which Sister Jeanne plays religious tunes a bit too loudly for Mr. Mahoney's taste) is housing for old people. The four rocking chairs arranged before the fireplace in the living room, however, are a tipoff.
The living room is where the house mates gather for their evening wine, highball or Bailey's Irish Cream, as Mr. Slavin assumes his self-appointed task of setting the table. As the group traveled to the dining room, the conversation wandered from Mr. Stenson's stories (like the one about the cow that ate his watch, on his family farm in Ireland) to the problem of guns in schools (Mr. Slavin, arguing that the problem was of long standing, drew on his experience as a schoolteacher in 1927) to the cancellation of several residents' favorite television program, the nostalgic "Brooklyn Bridge."
As the house mates recalled Walter Winchell or their favorite Brooklyn haunts and reminded one another of approaching doctor and beauty-parlor appointments, the conversations, like Mr. Stenson's stories, seemed to fall into familiar forms. After taking a telephone call, Sister Jeanne informed Mr. Slavin that his friend would be by to pick him up for his discussion group at a quarter to 8.
Mrs. Daniels: "Jim, you going out again tonight?"
Mr. Slavin: Purses lips, rolls eyes.
Group: Chuckles all around.
Sister Jeanne: "You thought you were getting away with it, Jim."
Mr. Slavin (grumpily): "No, I didn't, because Mary keeps very close track of when I get back."
In fact, Mrs. Daniels is known for waiting up until all her house mates are home safe. And Mr. Slavin is clearly less resentful of the attention than he pretends.
"Living in a home like this is so different than being alone," he said in the privacy of his room. "It promises a future. Aloneness does not."

HEADLINE: Anger and Regret in Aspen as Boycott Grows

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ASPEN, Colo., Dec. 29

 BODY:
The celestial people of Colorado's most exclusive ski resort are sulking. This is the week when they usually emerge triumphantly from Land-Rovers and Learjets to immerse themselves in fresh powder, endless nights and the adulation of those mortals able to afford $400 hotel rooms and $12 glasses of Scotch.
But this year, bitterness has crept into the thin mountain air. On Jan. 15, Colorado will become the first state in the nation with a constitution that prevents adoption of laws that specifically protect homosexuals from discrimination. Amendment 2, which passed in November, will also rescind local anti-discrimination statutes in Aspen, Boulder and Denver. Although officials worry about long-term damage to the state's $5 billion-a-year tourism industry, a growing boycott has done little to diminish the celebrity presence in Aspen this week. But it has done much to tarnish it. 
 "People there act as if they are exempt from all this," said Jan Williams, of Boycott Colorado, a Denver-based group leading efforts to repeal the amendment. "Even gays in Aspen act aloof, as if the end of their civil rights doesn't matter that much. Isn't there anything more important to them than their own momentary pleasure?"
It's hard to tell. The residents of Aspen, known for their wealth, their redwood sun decks and their dedication to leisure, are divided and angry. The city voted overwhelmingly against Amendment 2, so many citizens don't understand how a boycott that includes them, let alone focuses on them, can be fair. The boycott has already cost the state as much as $20 million, with cancellations continuing to roll in at a rate of $500,000 a day, the amendment's opponents say. And as it becomes clearer that the effort is far more than a passing whim, people here are beginning to seethe in public.
"Hypocrites" is what John Denver called those members of the Hollywood establishment, most famously Barbra Streisand, who favor boycotting Colorado. Jack Nicholson, who has two houses here, called the boycott "rubbish." And George Hamilton, whose Gothic family photograph adorns a wall in the exclusive Caribou Club, begged Liza Minnelli not to withdraw from a benefit concert for Undo 2, a local organization trying to have the amendment repealed. Ms. Minnelli pulled out anyway -- a decision that some here called a valiant act of conscience and that others called mindless pandering to the politically correct.
It will be months before the true power of the boycott can be assessed, but it could damage this state considerably. A similar boycott in Arizona, designed to force officials to adopt a holiday in recognition of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., cost the state at least $500 million in business over the last two years, and this year the state reversed its stand.
 
Repeal Effort Growing, Too
 More than a dozen groups in Colorado and around the nation have joined the effort to overturn the new constitutional provision, under which gay men and lesbians could be dismissed from jobs and denied housing because of their sexual orientation, and then prevented from challenging the discrimination. The Colorado office of the American Civil Liberties Union joined the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund and the cities of Aspen, Boulder and Denver in filing suit in Federal court to prevent the amendment from taking effect. But even the lawsuit's supporters question their chances in court, and most say it will take a new ballot referendum to reverse the amendment.
Representatives of Colorado for Family Values, which sponsored Amendment 2, say they have no desire to discriminate. "What they want is a special protected status," Will Perkins, a leader of the group, said of homosexuals. "They just don't deserve it. The majority of America is with us on this." He and other leaders who support the amendment say that homosexuals already have the rights guaranteed to every American under the Constitution and that it weakens the definition of a minority to say that someone deserves that legal status because of sexual orientation.
As much as the residents of this town that bills itself as a "small Democracy in the state of Colorado" would like to forget the issue, the boycott is spoken of everywhere: in the dining room of the newly completed Ritz Carlton, where almost everything but the Colorado Elk is "free range"; at Bonnie's, the popular Aspen Mountain lunch spot where Ivana Trump first accused Marla Maples of trying to steal her husband, and in the graceful bars of the Caribou Club, where there are two cloakrooms, one for fur (which Aspen almost banned three years ago), the other for lesser outerwear.
 
A Comparison to Warsaw
 "It's a real problem," said Harley Baldwin, the owner of the Caribou Club, which caters to rich residents and celebrities so famous a single name is often enough to describe them (Melanie and Don, Goldie and Kurt, Cher, Chevy), "and we do understand the sentiment for the boycott. Upon reflection, though, people who boycott Aspen must realize it's like attacking the Jews in the Warsaw ghetto because of the Nazis."
On Sunday, the rich and not-so-famous rolled up to the benefit concert at the Wheeler Opera House in custom-built, four-wheel-drive stretch Range Rover and Jeep limousines. Everyone seemed uncomfortable, as if their boots were too small. They gave dozens of reasons for thinking it unfair to pick on such a liberal, tolerant place as Aspen. In the end, only one message came through: boycotts cost money.
"Why bite the hand that feeds you?" asked Terry White, chairman of the Aspen Gay and Lesbian Community, which unlike most Colorado gay groups is opposed to the boycott. "I think we can deal with it in other ways."
Not everyone agrees. Tatou, the New York nightclub, has a wildly popular branch here, and Rudolph, a principal owner and well-known Manhattan nightclub impresario, came here for Christmas. "This boycott is going to hurt us badly," he said. "And it should. What has happened in this state is a disgrace. If we lose a little money, then we deserve to lose a little money. People here are kidding themselves if they think they can brush this off."
Even though hotels are booked and ski company officials say lift ticket sales are up as much as 15 percent over last winter, the boycott has shone a particularly harsh light on Aspen.
The sight of rich people swaddled in Gore-Tex and mink complaining that they shouldn't suffer economic privations because they would never "do this to gays," as the television actor Harry Hamlin said on Sunday, has angered many people who see in the Colorado amendment the first successful step in a national attempt to curtail the civil rights of homosexuals. The paradox of people fleeing liberal Aspen for ski vacations in Utah, one of the more conservative states in the nation, has been noted often here.
 
'No Sympathy' for Liberals
 "I am sorry to say I have no sympathy for the liberal people of Aspen," said Thomas B. Stoddard, former executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. "Where were they when this thing got on the ballot and when it passed? This is not about a few hundred decent people being inconvenienced. It is about guaranteeing basic human rights to American citizens. And if we fail in Colorado we will fail all around the country."
Acutely aware that conservative groups in at least seven other states (California, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio and Oregon) are working to put similar initiatives on the ballot next year, Mr. Stoddard and other national gay leaders want to make a lesson of Colorado. "We want to convince the people of that state that they have more to lose than to win by such measures," said Bill Rubenstein, of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Lesbian and Gay Rights Project. "People need to know that if they adopt measures that discriminate against gays they will be ostracized."
Several cities, including Atlanta, New York and Seattle, have announced that no employees on city business will travel to Colorado. Groups as diverse as the National Council for Social Studies and the National Mayors Conference have canceled conventions. A California company, Xchange Computers, has decided not to build a plant in Colorado that it said would have meant $5 million in wages a year.
"This could be very painful," said Rich Grant, director of communications for the Denver Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau. "Anybody who thinks this is a minor problem is being naive. We are doing everything we can to repeal this thing. But I don't think it is fair to compare a boycott of Colorado with a boycott of South Africa, as some have done. There you had decades of government-sponsored abuses, and here the amendment is not yet in effect. Really, aren't we just paying because we are the first?"

HEADLINE: The Quilted Giraffe Joins the Dinosaurs

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
TOMORROW evening, the champagne toasts at the Quilted Giraffe will welcome 1993 on a poignant note. In the first dawn of the new year, the granite tables in this sleek, trend-setting luxury restaurant in Manhattan, one of America's best, will be cleared for good.
Now, the connoisseurs who for years delighted in the lush beluga caviar beggar's purses, the surprisingly delicious wasabi pizza, the gossamer chocolate souffle tempered with a scoop of ice cream and the buttery pecan squares will have to rely on Proustian taste memories. 
 Barry Wine, 50, the self-taught chef and co-owner whose original turn of palate coined a host of memorable dishes, insists he will never open another restaurant. His wife, Susan, 46, who has been his partner in the Quilted Giraffe from the beginning, is breathing a sigh of relief over what she described as an unbelievably demanding job. The dedication of both Wines made their restaurant one of the early standard bearers of American excellence when the field was far less crowded than it is today.
"The closing of the Quilted Giraffe is the end of an era," said Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant in New York. "It turned the innocence, the exploring that Americans did in food in the 1970's into a seriousness of purpose and success in the 80's, and it will be missed."
The Wines are closing the Quilted Giraffe permanently because the Sony Corporation, which owns the building on Madison Avenue at 55th Street where the restaurant is situated, has planned major construction work for the site. The restaurant would have had to close, at least temporarily. The Wines sold their lease to Sony for what they said was a seven-figure amount.
"We don't want there to be any confusion about why this is happening," Mrs. Wine said. "It presents an opportunity for us that is not likely to happen again."
As American restaurants go, an establishment like the Quilted Giraffe is also unlikely to happen again. It was about much more than the beggar's purses, those tender crepes filled with the finest caviar and creme fraiche and tied in a bundle with a strip of chive that have been mimicked by dozens of chefs and fetched a $50 surcharge on the $75 prix-fixe dinner menu.
Although it's easy to focus on the stunning price tags that made ingredients like beluga caviar, foie gras and truffles possible, what's more important is that the Quilted Giraffe epitomized refined American dining as it was coming into its own.
"The Quilted Giraffe was one of the first serious luxury restaurants on the French model that had no pretense of being French," said David Waltuck, who opened Chanterelle in SoHo in late 1979, about six months after the Quilted Giraffe opened at Second Avenue and 50th Street.
Like many Americans who became passionate about food in the mid-1970's, the Wines looked first to France but soon began flexing some serious American muscle. For example, after tasting leg of lamb baked in hay at Les Pres et les Sources d'Eugenie, a Michelin three-star restaurant in Eugenie-les-Bains, France, Mr. Wine came up with his own version: lamb baked in corn husks.
For the Wines, the model was not the bistro or brasserie that is so in vogue today, but the three-star temple of gastronomy where every element, even the flower arrangement in the powder room, was the ultimate in elegance. They became obsessed with such details.
But within that deluxe context, their menu was written in English, they used locally grown ingredients as much as possible, and they even raised some of their own flowers and herbs. They had a crew of Americans in the kitchen and hired American waiters and captains, expecting them to perform with as much finesse as their French counterparts at restaurants like La Grenouille. The wine list emphasized California.
The Quilted Giraffe, which opened with 60 seats in a warm, elegant jewel-box setting on Second Avenue in June 1979, had relocated from New Paltz, N.Y., where, since 1975, it had been in business as a country French restaurant. The Wines, both from the Midwest, had moved to New Paltz from Manhattan in 1970 in pursuit of a simpler way of life.
Mr. Wine, a graduate of Tufts University and the University of Chicago Law School, had worked at a Wall Street law firm and set up his own practice in New Paltz. Mrs. Wine, a graduate of Barnard College, opened an art gallery and a dress shop.
A tea room followed, and it soon became a country French restaurant with Mr. Wine in the kitchen and Mrs. Wine at the door. They were going to name it Maxime's, but settled on the Quilted Giraffe when they hung some baby quilts adorned with giraffes as decorations.
The early menus, listing chicken cordon bleu and a salad with canned mandarin oranges, were truly quaint by today's standards. But at the same time, the Wines were already pursuing some novel ideas, like serving wine by the glass and creating special wine dinners. They were quick studies, and soon, after a few eye-opening trips to France, they began serving more elaborate and imaginative food.
Critical praise began flowing in. Gael Greene, the critic for New York magazine, described the Wines as "dedicated amateurs," understanding the term amateur in the literal sense, as a lover of something or a devotee.
Jan Birnbaum, who worked at the Quilted Giraffe from 1985 to 1987 and is now the chef at Campton Place in San Francisco, said that as a chef, Mr. Wine was more open to innovation because he was not professionally trained.
"He also understood the customer's point of view better than most cooks," Mr. Birnbaum added. "I learned what I know about fine dining from him."
Mr. Wine said that in the beginning, he wasn't sure about his talent and worried about his lack of training. "By around 1983, I began to have real confidence in my ability," he said. "It comes incredibly easy to me. I look at raw ingredients and begin to think about what to make with them, not what should be made or what must be made. Not having an investment in a French cooking education made me freer than those other guys."
By the early 80's, Mr. Wine was drizzling red-pepper oil around portions of grilled swordfish, serving sea urchins from Maine and thickening a sauce with mashed potatoes, all strikingly new concepts at the time. David Burke, the chef at Park Avenue Cafe in Manhattan, said Mr. Wine "was the first chef who showed me how creative and whimsical you can be."
That creativity was controversial, and some found it pretentious. Experiments, like duck with a bananas Foster sauce or mustard ice cream, did not always work. Many people regarded the prices as outrageous. The attitude at the door, which did not take kindly to complaints or latecomers, was businesslike, even rigid..
The Quilted Giraffe was not a favorite of Mimi Sheraton when she was the restaurant critic for The New York Times in the early 1980's, but it received a four-star rating in the newspaper from Marian Burros in 1984 and has retained that rating.
The Wines were among the first restaurateurs to look to Japan, recognizing the importance of the Japanese clientele and leading the way as Asia became a new inspiration for American cooks. A Japanese tasting dinner priced at $135 that appeared on the menu was perhaps less controversial than some of the other practices at the restaurant.
Mrs. Wine was a stern taskmaster, strictly enforcing the reservation policy that required reconfirmation by a particular time. And no calls were taken during the dinner hour. Some potential customers, their egos bruised by these rules, stayed away. Mrs. Wine was sanguine about such critics. "There was unbelievable demand," she said, "and we had to make sure people would come when they said they would, because we could not afford to waste a seat."
The Wines established a mandatory 18 percent service charge. Some customers objected, but it made it possible to put the staff on a good salary with benefits. "It added to their professionalism," Mr. Wine said.
Charlie Trotter, the chef and owner of Charlie Trotter's in Chicago, who regards Mr. Wine as a "soul mate," said the Quilted Giraffe was one of the first American restaurants where the importance of excellent service was fully understood. "It was not just the food," he said. "It was the whole experience."
The Wines mixed and matched the dinnerware, often one-of-a-kind items, selecting pieces that they felt best complemented the food. And in 1986, when it seemed as if even the sky was not the limit, they opened the Casual Quilted Giraffe, a lavishly appointed establishment with 80 seats, in what was then the A.T.& T. building on Madison Avenue at 55th Street.
The idea of a Casual Quilted Giraffe turned out to be an oxymoron, so in 1987, saddled with the new costly installation and a long lease, the Wines closed the original restaurant, dropped Casual from the name of the place on Madison Avenue and maintained the Quilted Giraffe, high prices and all, throughout the recession. Until now.
Mr. Wine said he would be a vice president of Sony, overseeing corporate food operations. He said he would start work on Monday. Mrs. Wine plans to write the Quilted Giraffe cookbook. Both denied a published report that with the restaurant closing, they planned to divorce.
Mrs. Wine said she was probably going to have an identity crisis. Mr. Wine said his mood was both fantastic and sad. "But," he added, "I truly feel we've accomplished something."

HEADLINE: Discovering Something New in Food: Pleasure

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
MOST people still eat what they want, especially at this time of year, though they do so with trepidation and guilt. Having a chocolate chip cookie? Having 10? Then almost certainly, you're silently berating yourself and promising that when the New Year comes, such terrible lapses will be banished.
The pleasure hasn't disappeared from food, but it has become intricately intertwined with negative emotions since people have become conscious of the problems of cholesterol and fat, pesticides and food poisoning, sugar and salt. 
 Although some people insist that they unabashedly enjoy what they eat, surveys show that many people have experienced a loss of pleasure in eating from the dietary changes they have made. They're so unhappy about it, especially in a difficult recessionary time when food could provide a special thrill, that they may be ready to rebel.
"I think people are looking for a way to recover the pleasure they used to take in food," said Art Siemering, publisher of the Food Channel, a newsletter published in Chicago by the advertising and research company Noble Communications. "They're eating more food that doesn't taste as good, and some of them are going to sit down and realize there's something missing here."
To try to refocus on the pleasure and fun of foods, a number of companies, even those that make "good" food, are starting to emphasize the pleasurable rewards of their products rather than just the nutritional ones.
Although much has been made of the need for a low-fat diet, hardly anyone talks about the need for pleasure -- and not just for fun. Studies have shown that the appearance and taste of food affects nutrient absorption.
"If you don't have the pleasure, the use you get from your food is reduced," said Walter Mertz, director of the United States Agriculture Department's Human Nutrition Research Center in Beltsville, Md.
A study done a few years ago by a Swedish researcher, he said, showed that iron absorption levels were higher when people ate attractively presented food than when they ate food that had been turned into an ugly goo in a blender. Another study by the same researcher looked at nutrient absorption when people from Thailand were given Swedish food and Swedes were given Thai food. Neither group was happy with its meal, and members of both groups absorbed less iron.
Although very few people permanently eliminate the foods they enjoy, many have cut back. Some have exaggerated notions of how much they must cut out to be healthy. For instance, 17 percent believe they must cut out all fat, some of which is actually essential to a healthy diet, according to a survey of 1,000 adults done last year by the American Dietetic Association, Kraft General Foods and the Good Housekeeping Institute.
When people do indulge, they don't have unadulterated fun. Stephen Greenwald, a film executive in New York, said he always thought he ought to be dieting, and so he always felt guilty when he ate. "I still enjoy eating, but it's enjoyment with a question mark," he continued, adding that the only food he could eat without guilt was a carrot.
The 10 foods most frequently sacrificed or cut back for the sake of health have been burgers, butter, bacon, sausage, lunch meat, eggs, fast food, fried food, cheese and whole milk, said Mona Doyle, president of Consumer Network, a market research company in Philadelphia.
In a study she did earlier this year on fun and pleasure in food, she found that consumers also said they had sacrificed other oral pleasures, like cigarettes, marijuana and hard liquor, and felt deprived as a result.
Many companies, she said, are nevertheless reluctant to sell the glory of simple pleasure. "They're like a bunch of lemmings," she continued. "No one's saying, 'Just for the sheer fun of it, eat this.' " She recalled the horror she encountered when she suggested to some food marketing managers that they find a way to provide adults with more oral gratification from food, just as they do for children when they emphasize the squeezability and suckability of a product. "There are taboos," she said.
But the focus may be starting to tilt back toward pleasure. Mathew Crisci, an executive vice president at the Lintas advertising company in New York, said companies were putting more emphasis on taste. For instance, to promote Mr. Turkey, a turkey bacon, his company is producing ads that tout the taste first, and the reduction in fat only secondarily. A few years ago, he said, "you probably would have been banging harder at the problems of bacon having a lot of fat."
Likewise, his company is reviving the old Sara Lee jingle, "Everybody doesn't like something, but nobody doesn't like Sara Lee," because it plays to the image and memory of fun. Gone are the hip ads with Debbie Harry, the rock singer, and the practical ones with recipes. "What we've gone back to," he said, "is a simple, everyday, pleasurable dessert."
Similarly, Weight Watchers has successfully shored up its lagging sales by making two big changes this year: improving the taste of its products and then emphasizing the pleasure of the food rather than just its dietary benefit.
Jay Abraham, vice president of the Weight Watchers Food Company in Pittsburgh, said the company jettisoned its old advertising with Lynn Redgrave because it put too much focus on dieting, and shifted to a new campaign with the tag line, "Total Indulgence, Zero Guilt." Being seen as a diet food is no longer advantageous; being seen as a pleasurable food that happens to be low in calories is. "We know that consumers love to eat and that overweight consumers love to eat even more," he added.
Barbara Caplan, an associate director at Yankelovich Partners in Westport, Conn., a research and consulting firm, said she was telling food clients to put less emphasis on convenience and health, and more on pleasure. "We are seeing the pleasure factor emerge as something extremely important," she continued, adding that she believed that people, perhaps because they have already incorporated healthful changes in their diets, are less obsessive in analyzing the contents of foods.
The way they experience pleasure may also be changing. In the 1980's, she said, the ultimate pleasure was to eat the creations of well-known chefs; pleasure came from status. Now, she added, people seek personal gratification that is internally experienced rather than externally defined.
Historically, food has been a relatively inexpensive way to cope with stress and a tight economy. "You're not going to buy yourself a lot of clothes," said Judith Langer, a market researcher in New York, "but you can still go out Saturday night to a moderately priced place."
Even as people reduce the fat in some aspect of their meals, they compensate by loading up on rich desserts. Five new flavors of Haagen-Dazs ice cream, with even more fat and calories than the already-rich versions on the market, were introduced this year. They have already increased the company's share of the ice-cream market from 5.9 percent to 7.6 percent, said David Gilman, a spokesman for Haagen-Dazs.
Some people, though, have learned to find pleasure in new ways. Fern Mallis, head of the Council of Fashion Designers, has been following a low-fat diet and can't even remember the last time she ordered a steak. "I look at it on the menu and I think: I'll be sluggish and I'll be adding more fat to my system," she said. This approach, she added gives her "the joy of doing something right."
Howard Solganik, a food consultant in Dayton, Ohio, said some rich foods he enjoyed in the past were no longer comfortable to eat. "Half-and-Half in coffee feels like it's coating my teeth," he said. (All those saved calories, he said, now go toward the occasional killer brownie secretly consumed while driving his car.)
There is the option, too, of reducing the importance of food as a source of pleasure. Amy Pearson, a graduate student in New York who used to love foods like french fries but found she gained too much weight, said she has tried to cut down on "recreational eating." Going to restaurants with friends, she added, inevitably leads to a few drinks, "and then you don't care what you eat."
She has tried to find alternatives, like meeting friends at movies, but it's difficult when so much social life revolves around food. "I think food should be more like a function to survive," she said.
The ultimate goal seems to be balance, and that is becoming easier as companies make choices more palatable by offering better-tasting versions of healthier foods. Plain rice cakes are fading in popularity, for instance, as tastier options with more seasoning, and sometimes more fat, are introduced. "The ones that sell are the ones that have the flavor," said Cheryl Stewart-Miller, a spokeswoman for Heinz USA, which owns the Chico-San rice cake brand.
Those who try to take the temperature of the times say they perceive a greater optimism that may result in a less harsh attitude toward everything, including food.
"There is definitely a lighter air out there," said Gerald Celente, director of the Trends Research Institute in Rhinebeck, N.Y. "Now, it's O.K. to laugh, and it's O.K. to have fun."
In part, he and other researchers cite a feeling of optimism brought on by the coming change in the White House and the ascension to power of the baby-boom generation. No one knows how long this feeling will last.
But for now, bring on the brownies.

Finding What's Wrong With U.S. Health Care

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Tom Brokaw is tonight's guide to the ailments of what passes as America's health care system. The hour-long report is no ground breaker, but a description of symptoms can be the beginning of treatment for a condition that worries so much of the nation.
The first stop is the constantly crowded emergency room of Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, which, like many inner-city hospitals, serves as doctor of first resort for people who can't afford a doctor of their own. The pictures get across the long waits for most patients and the frantic pace and high burnout rate for the doctors, who tell of treating everything from gunshot wounds to allergies. 
 Mr. Brokaw explains that the situation also means financial problems for the hospital, which loads its unreimbursed expenses onto insured patients, an involuntary form of charity that raises the price of insurance to employers and employees. The hospitals call it cost-shifting; Mr. Brokaw calls it a huge shell game.
A family doctor in the small town of Shelby, N.C., personifies the predicament of an old-style practitioner trying to keep up with ever more complicated insurance rules. The doctor, who has had to hire three people just to do the paper work, says he devotes half his time to medicine, half to "the hassle factor."
Also adding to the nation's medical bills is the incentive for doctors to order all manner of tests as a defense against malpractice suits or simply a way of making more money. A doctor in New York, who does not accept Medicare patients, explains that the tests, which take less time than an old-fashioned examination, are the most lucrative part of her practice. Since her patients pass the bill onto their insurers, they have no particular reason to say no to yet another costly bit of diagnosis.
The most original segment of the report shows how competition for fully insured patients by three well-equipped hospitals in the small city of Rockford, Ill., means duplicated services and unnecessary costs, since hospitals and doctors are tempted to amortize their high-priced equipment even when its use may not be strictly necessary. One technician says of a state-of-the-art body scanner, "The table does not usually get cold."
Despite a hyperactive camera that seems determined to distract viewers from the information that Mr. Brokaw is trying to impart, the program manages to spotlight a market economy's impediments to rational health care for all. The main hope offered here is for health maintenance organizations, which promise to provide more efficient care by emphasizing preventive medicine and cutting the extras.
The hour concludes, in a segment that was not available for review, with Mr. Brokaw talking to three experts about how to control costs and develop a national health-care policy. It can't hurt.
 
'Health Quarterly'
Tuesday at 9 P.M., Channel 13
Speaking of medicine and money, next week's edition of "Health Quarterly" (Tuesday, 9 P.M. on Channel 13) carries a report on doctors' latest method for upping their incomes. Some are going into partnerships on such businesses as out-patient surgical centers, radiation therapy centers and clinical laboratories, to which they then refer their patients, a practice known bluntly as physician self-referral. A doctor in Florida invested $120,000 in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner, a high-tech device that permits diagnoses of soft tissue without digging in; at about $1,000 a scan, he made $141,000 on his investment in one year. The question raised in the program is whether a scan is sometimes a scam.

There is no real off-season in wine country, but things do slow down a bit around now, which makes it the right time to look back at the year as it wanes and try to guess at a few of the things to come. 
 Two of the bigger wine stories this year were the phylloxera epidemic in California and the threatened imposition by the United States Government of huge retaliatory duties on white wine from the European Community.
Phylloxera bugs were first discovered in the California vineyards about five years ago. They turned out to be a new mutation of the bug that destroyed most of the world's vinifera vines at the end of the last century. What's more, the rootstock that California scientists recommended as impervious to phylloxera proved to be anything but.
The insects continue to chomp their way through the vineyards, but predictions made earlier this year by industry experts that 150,000 acres of vines would have to be replaced in Sonoma and Napa counties alone, at a cost of $1 billion, have not come true. The advance of the blight is under control, they now say, and replanting with authentically resistant vines, while costly, would have been done anyway and the phylloxera just speeded things up. They contend that the new vines and planting techniques, along with advanced vineyard management practices, will mean better wines.
Those threatened import duties, pegged at 200 percent, were meant as a response to French farmers, who refused to go along with cutbacks in their Government's subsidies. Wine merchants took out advertisements urging customers to buy their Macon blanc quickly, before the price went from $9 to $27.
Last-minute negotiations in Brussels averted the crisis, at least for the present. The French farmers have not relented, however, and the crisis may flare up again. If it does, wine importers are hoping that President Clinton's trade negotiators will single out another commodity. In any case, chances are that neither phylloxera nor the French farmers loom as great threats in 1993.
From the wine maker's point of view, 1992 was another mediocre year. Several more small wineries declared bankruptcy in California, and Heublein Corporation, a division of England's Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., announced that it would combine its inexpensive wine business with its premium wine business. This move makes the future uncertain for Inglenook, Quail Ridge, Gustave Niebaum and perhaps even Heublein's most important property, Beaulieu Vineyard.
Consultants warn that economic conditions will call for even more belt tightening next year in the industry as a whole.
In France, insurance companies continued to scoop up famous wineries. This year, the Axa Group purchased a controlling interest in one of the best-known Sauternes chateaux, Suduiraut. Axa now controls eight properties in Bordeaux, a vineyard in Burgundy and another in the Tokay region of Hungary.
One bright spot domestically was the retail trade, particularly at the fine-wine level and during the heavy-buying holiday season. (In case you were wondering, fine wine is just about any bottle of wine that has a cork in it; lesser wines tend to have screw tops.) Restaurant owners lie awake nights wondering how to switch their customers from Perrier to Pomerol, but they readily acknowledge that business has improved in the last six months. Most wine retailers say this holiday season is their best in years.
While the fitness craze shows few signs of slackening, the perception seems to have taken hold that a moderate intake of wine can be healthful. To the dismay of prohibitionists, even the Federal Government has softened its stance on claims that wine drinking has health benefits. In October, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms approved a request from Beringer Vineyards, in California, that its bottles be able to carry claims linking lower rates of heart disease with the consumption of red wine. The claims, printed on small folders hung on the necks of Beringer bottles, come from transcripts of a 1991 "60 Minutes" program.
The program contended that consumption of red wine contributes to a relatively low incidence of heart disease in France, despite a prevailing diet that is high in fat. Previously, the agency had maintained that the "60 Minutes" material did not warrant a relaxation of the rule that no positive health claim can be used on alcoholic beverages.
As other wineries adopt the Beringer approach in the coming year, public attitudes toward wine should continue to change. This view of wine as something that is good for you, coupled with a new awareness, brought on by the recession, that good wine need not be expensive, might at long last begin to move wine into the mainstream of American culture, just as it is in the culture of so many European countries.
Some favorable wine trends should continue. After some false starts, the quality of California and Oregon pinot noirs grows almost exponentially. The same is true for the Rhone varietals like mourvedre, grenache, syrah and viognier -- although I wish I could share in the general enthusiasm for the viognier grape.
More and more California vineyards are being planted with Italian varieties, especially the Tuscan favorite, sangiovese, and the coming year should see more California versions of Chianti on the market. So far, California wines made from Italian grape varieties have been good to indifferent and priced substantially higher than the much better Italian originals. This situation will change, but probably not in 1993.
The one change that all wine drinkers hope for in the coming year is lower wine prices. With plenty of unsold wine in most wine regions of the world, it's a wish that will probably be fulfilled. After years of excessive prices, one can only say that it's about time.
Now if someone can just get the restaurants to go along. . . .
 
TASTINGS
Talley Vineyards Pinot Noir 1990, Reserve Grande Arroyo; about $17.
Pinot noir is the red grape of Burgundy, and for years, American wine makers have striven to make a Burgundian wine out of it. Recently, they have been succeeding beyond anything anyone had thought possible. This wine, from a vineyard in San Luis Obispo County in California, is a beautiful example of what is being done. Rich, earthy and fragrant, it is in the classic tradition of the Cote-d'Or and is from a region that is turning out to be a prime producer of such wine. Pinot noir is notoriously difficult to grow, but the Californians and the Oregonians have worked for years to meet the challenge, and their wines get better every year. With wines like this coming from the West Coast, even in very short supply, the Burgundians are going to have to look beyond their laurels if they hope to remain pre-eminent as vintners of pinot noir. Reserve Grande Arroyo is not yet available in New York, though it should be soon.

HEADLINE: Clinton Shakes Up Economics Establishment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"More Advisers, Less Council" (Economic Scene column, Dec. 17) by Peter Passell, on the disparagement by some economists about President-elect Clinton's appointment of Prof. Laura D'Andrea Tyson to head the Council of Economic Advisers shows much of what is wrong with the economics profession. Unfortunately, bad manners and sour grapes are not the only problem. 
 No one has challenged Dr. Tyson's intelligence, professional credentials or achievements. The complaint seems that she is not a member of the largely old boys' club that looks upon the council as a reward for academic service, rather than as an instrument for addressing the real world problems confronting the President.
In the face of an increasingly global economy, where markets operate under a variety of rules and customs, the highest academic accolades continue to go to those who build theories on simplistic assumptions of pure competition and perfect knowledge. The profession insists that it is an objective science, yet, as the column notes, Ms. Tyson's detractors worry about "her lack of ideological commitment to free trade." It apparently never dawns on these scholars that this ideological commitment may bias their own analyses.
In contrast, Dr. Tyson has distinguished herself by drawing conclusions based on the evidence of how the real economic world works. Her research on the effect of trade and technology on the health of United States industry gives us important economic insights that traditional analysis ignores. By no stretch of the imagination can she be described as a "protectionist." Yet, sadly, her willingness to question the hoary assumptions of the profession has moved those who feel intellectually threatened to childish name calling.
Such energy could more fruitfully be devoted to examining why conventional economic wisdom has not helped us understand the new economy and therefore has not helped in efforts to regain prosperity.
Indeed, the majority of economists continue to assure us that the only way to prevent future inflation is to maintain high levels of unemployment, that it doesn't matter whether the United States produces silicon chips or potato chips and that despite the growing social and environmental costs of laissez-faire, the judgment of the market is always right. Comfortably secure in their own lifetime tenures at universities and endowed think tanks, they are quick to lecture the rest of us on the cleansing virtues of unemployment and bankruptcy.
President-elect Clinton is to be congratulated on the appointment of Dr. Tyson. He has done the economics profession a service by adding it to the list of institutions that are ripe for change.

Business Technology
In a year of industry reshaping, rather than big breakthroughs, Corporate America's biggest research-and-development spenders pared down and scaled back. [Page D1.] Whether in computers or telephones, biotechnology or Japan Inc., 1992 was a time to regroup. [D5.]
Japan is not buying the number of U.S. chips expected in last year's semiconductor agreement, the United States trade representative said. Access to Japan's computer chip market will be one of the first trade issues to confront Bill Clinton after his inauguration as President. [D1.] 
 The F.D.A. approved Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug Taxol, a treatment for advanced ovarian cancer that Federal health officials consider a significant advance against, though not a cure for, a disease that kills 13,000 American women a year. [A10.]
 
 The Economy
The mood of consumers was increasingly upbeat in December. The Conference Board index jumped to 78.3 points, its highest level since April 1991. "It's a long-term feeling; it's here to stay," the manager of Oklahoma's largest shopping mall said. [D1.]
 
Companies
American Airlines' parent will invest in Canadian Airlines, a $194 million infusion giving the struggling carrier much-needed cash. The agreement includes service deals that could give American $2 billion over 20 years. [D1.]
Three people pleaded guilty to massive insurance fraud. A former executive and two business associates of International Forum of Florida Health Benefit Trust had been charged with defrauding 43,000 health insurance customers. [D3.]
McDonnell Douglas farmed out its data operations to I.B.M., continuing a trend among large manufacturers to hire computer specialists to handle their information processing needs. The 10-year deal is worth an estimated $3 billion. [D3.]
Shares of Food Lion have been removed from the "buy" list of a Smith Barney analyst, responding to a steep decline in the price of the supermarket chain's stock since an ABC News program last month accused the company of routinely selling spoiled food in unsanitary stores. [D3.]
Greyhound Lines announced price cuts of up to 50 percent on advance-purchase bus tickets. The "Go Easy Fares" will be good for travel between Jan. 6 and June 4. [D3.]

January forecast: higher prices in the municipal market, as billions of dollars will pour into the hands of municipal bond investors and bond funds from calls, redemptions and interest payments. [D12.]
The dollar drifted lower against most major currencies, as the traders ignored bullish economic reports that normally would have provided a lift. Gold prices also fell. [D13.]

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 22.42, to 3,310.84; Program Traders Pitch In

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Investors inspired by a report of higher consumer confidence battled program traders to a draw yesterday in a clash that ultimately produced more noise than movement.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which was up as much as 19 points by early afternooon, closed at 3,310.84, off 22.42, after computerized sell programs barreled in. The broader market was almost even, with slightly more gainers than losers. 
 The Nasdaq composite index, consisting primarily of smaller stocks, preserved enough of its gains to finish up 2.76, to 669.01, a record.
 
 
214 Million Shares Traded
 Trading volume on the Big Board was about 214 million shares, about average for recent months but heavy for a week bracketed by holidays.
Shares of some retailers and other stocks sensitive to the economy's cycles were aided the most by yesterday's consumer-confidence reports. A rally in the bond market added support.
"There are definitely buyers in the wings," said Thomas McManus, a market analyst at Morgan Stanley. "All they need is some piece of news to spark their interest."
Woolworth and Sears, Roebuck were among the Dow's few gainers, while May Department Stores added $1.50, to $71.50.
 The Conference Board reported yesterday that consumer confidence had jumped to its highest level since shortly after the Persian Gulf war ended in 1991. Retailers recorded strong December sales, while the University of Michigan and Fidelity Investments said that investor sentiment had recently grown much more positive.
Almost two-thirds of the Dow's loss was caused by sharp declines in 3M, Goodyear and I.B.M. Fears that foreign recessions would hurt 3M's earnings have caused the normally placid stock to become jumpy lately. Yesterday's loss of $2.75 left the shares at $100.125 each.
I.B.M. resumed its plunge by dropping $2, to $49.75, in heavy trading. Merrill Lynch cut its rating on the stock, and several analysts warned bargain hunters to stay away. Jack Solomon, a Bear, Stearns strategist, called the trading in I.B.M. "window undressing," alluding to selling by money managers who would rather not show large holdings of the stock in their year-end reports.
 
 
Glaxo Injection Approved
 Some drug companies, little loved of late, found some favor yesterday with regulators and investors alike. Glaxo, the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, gained $1.125, to $23.375. Regulators approved its new injection for migraine headaches.
General Motors, off 62.5 cents, to $32.50, fell behind Chrysler, which closed unchanged at $32.75, for the first time in five years, although G.M.'s total market value remains much greater.
The Nasdaq index, up 14 percent this year, extended its advantage over the Dow and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, both ahead by about 5 percent. Big contributors to the Nasdaq record yesterday included McCaw Cellular, up $1; Novell, up 87.5 cents, and Synergen, up $2.125.
Traders predict that for the last few days of the year, their strategies will continue to toss the market. "We did a program, but we're pretty divorced from other market trends," one trader said.

Ties to Atlanta's Jews

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A. M. Rosenthal in his Dec. 15 column on special interests, makes a great deal of sense. We do well to recognize that those who serve the public have special interests, and our expectation is that they approach issues with honesty and candor. 
 Yet his closing paragraphs, attacking Dr. Johnetta Cole, are very disturbing. She has an extraordinary standing in the Atlanta community. Professionally and personally, she has close and positive relations with the Jewish community.
She has shown herself an outstanding educator. She is involved with Jimmy Carter's Atlanta Project, heading the Summerhill clusters, in which the Atlanta Jewish Federation leadership is directly involved.
My relationship with her grows out of my appointment as a visiting professor at Spelman College teaching Jewish studies. Dr. Cole has supported the program and underscores the importance for future leaders of the Afro-American community to know about Jewish thought and practices.

Attack on Johnetta Cole

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It would be comic if it weren't tragic: The Forward, which in another generation was a proudly socialist Yiddish newspaper, accuses Johnetta Cole, a distinguished black educator, of belonging to suspiciously left-leaning organizations. Others, such as A. M. Rosenthal in "The Special Interests" (column, Dec. 15), pick up the charges and demand Ms. Cole's expulsion from President-elect Clinton's transition team. 
 What do the charges amount to? She opposed United States foreign policy. But what of the admirable record of her achievements as an educator? I suggest that her accusers look into Ms. Cole's accomplishments at Spelman College -- which produces more black women science graduates than any other institution -- to see why so many of us in business and education circles hold her in such high regard. Ms. Cole has contributed a great deal to our public life. It would be a shameful waste of talent if we were denied further benefit of her skill.

HEADLINE: Clinton Shakes Up Economics Establishment;
Reich's Advantage

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report that Robert Reich, President-elect Clinton's chief economic adviser, is "criticized by trained economists, mostly on the ground that he is a lawyer and his insights lack the rigor and precision that economists provide through their training in mathematics and economic theory" (Business Day, Nov. 21). Mr. Reich's merit, and Mr. Clinton's wisdom in relying on him, rests precisely on Mr. Reich's nonentanglement in mathematical abstractions and economic theory, which apply at best to a world of perfect competition and have not been successfully adapted to any real functioning economy. 
 The new Administration needs advice that recognizes that the economy is embedded in a society, polity and culture. Economic changes must take account of the implications for the surrounding human context.
How will Americans respond to cuts in entitlements: by saving less or -- more? Will they rebel against a hefty tax increase on gasoline or just complain for a while, but learn to see the merit of such a tax? Can people be trained or retrained quickly, or is the remaking of the American labor force a long and difficult undertaking? Can we save the former Soviet Union by sending billions? And so on.
Mr. Reich and our 1,200 colleagues, who specialize in these embedded issues in what we call socioeconomics, are ready to show that we have a stronger grip on the real world than those who earned their Ph.D. in math and economic theory. Indeed, to provide better advice than neoclassical economists provided Presidents over the last years is not an inordinately difficult task.

A Cash Surge Soon for Municipals

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
In January it happens. Billions of dollars will pour into the hands of municipal bond investors and municipal bond funds, leading many analysts to forecast that January, once again, will be a month of rising prices in the municipal market.
The money's source: the expected record $12 billion to $15 billion in calls or redemptions of bonds, and billions more in semiannual bond interest payments, said George Friedlander, a managing director and fixed-income strategist at Smith Barney. 
 While not all of it will be plowed back into municipal bonds, a lot will be, as investors and fund managers, who are losing double-digit interest rates on the old bonds, scramble to get the highest tax-exempt yields they can.
 
'Things Will Get Overvalued'
 But some analysts who agree with this forecast, including Mr. Friedlander, warn that it will also be easy for the market to rally too far -- as it did in July -- and investors who scramble to buy in January may see prices drop sharply in the following months.
"I anticipate that things will get overvalued in January, and then we will have a correction in February and March," said James F. Lynch, editor of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory in New York.
That is exactly what happened in July, when the last series of calls and redemptions flooded the market. Municipal prices rose, and tax-exempt interest rates fell below 80 percent of the equivalent taxable Treasury yields, a danger line that signals to some analysts that a correction is coming. And come it did: municipal yields rose and prices fell sharply.
For Mr. Friedlander, this means investors should be cautious in January and not worry if prices move too high. "If it does get hard to fill your portfolio without paying too much compared to December prices, you should slow down," he said. "You should become choosier. You don't have to get panicky about putting your money to work." With the market backing off in February, he predicted, prices will come down again.
 
Effect of Megadeals
 Mr. Friedlander warned that the rally that has been forecast for January has already been anticipated by investors and traders, so it might not end up as strong as expected. In addition, some megadeals that are floating around could be drawn into the market if interest rates fall further, which could damp price increases. For example, he said, Smith Barney is an underwriter of a $1.6 billion issue planned by the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency.
If the January rally develops as forecast, it will come after a record year for the tax-exempt municipal bond market. Total issuance of such bonds is expected to reach $233 billion in 1992, outstripping the record $222 billion in 1985, according to the Public Securities Association. And interest rates on long-term municipal bonds sank to their lowest levels since 1979. But 1992 has also been a volatile year, in which long-term rates will end little changed from where they began.
Into the last week of the year, the tax-exempt bond market has outperformed the Treasury market a little. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which ended last year at 7.39 percent, stood at 7.36 percent yesterday. The yield on 30-year AAA-rated municipals ended 1991 at 6.4 percent, according to the Depphis Hanover Corporation, and was at 6.1 percent yesterday, a slightly better improvement than in the Treasury market.
But the yield on long municipal bonds is now farther from its low for the year than the 30-year Treasury bond is. The low yield for 30-year municipal bonds was 5.8 percent on July 30 -- three-tenths of a percentage point below the current level. By comparison, the low for Treasury bonds, 7.21 percent on Sept. 8, was less than two-tenths of a point below yesterday's yield.
 
Other Sources of Support
 In addition to the influx of cash at the beginning of the coming year, analysts say that several other factors should help support municipal bond prices in 1993. One is the expectation that the flow of new issues will slow significantly.
The reason for this is that a major portion of this year's issuance -- about $95 billion -- went to pay off existing bonds bearing higher interest rates. Because much of the high-rate bonds of the early 1980's have now been refunded or paid off, such refinancing bonds are expected to drop to around $50 billion next year. Total new issuance next year is expected to drop 21 percent, to $185 billion, the Public Securities Association said.
The decline in supply of new bonds is likely to lift bond prices. In addition, President-elect Bill Clinton has said he intends to propose raising the income tax rate for families with incomes exceeding $200,000 to 36 percent from 31 percent. This will make the tax-exempt yield from municipal bonds even more attractive.
William T. Reynolds, director of the municipal bond division at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. in Baltimore, said one thing will be the same as last year: "We still anticipate a volatile environment for our market." So 1993, like '92, could see a lot of ups and downs.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Market
 In another show of the volatility possible in a holiday market with light trading, Treasury prices jumped sharply yesterday, regaining what they lost Monday. The few traders and investors who were buying seemed to ignore several reports that reflected strength in the economy, including a 5.8 percent rise in existing-home sales in November.
In fact, the price of the long bond moved much higher, once it appeared that the price would not fall after the Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index rose to 78.3 in December, from a revised 65.6 in November. This rally forced those who had sold to buy back bonds to prevent losses, which pushed the price even higher.
In trading in the secondary market, the price of the 30-year bond grew 16/32 to yield 7.36 percent, down from 7.4 percent Monday. On Monday the price of the 30-year bond fell 15/32 . The same pattern was true with Treasury notes. For example, the price of the 10-year note rose 10/32 yesterday after falling 10/32 Monday. The yield was 6.68 percent, down from 6.71 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Escalates War of Words Over Chip Imports by Japan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29

 BODY:
Japan's promise last year to open its market in computer chips is not producing the level of American sales that both nations said they expected, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said today.
"This lack of improvement calls into question Japan's resolve to implement" last year's arrangement, Mrs. Hills said in an unusually strong statement accompanying her quarterly review of Japanese compliance with the pact. "Japan's efforts simply must be intensified if we are to avert a serious confrontation on this issue." 
 Access to Japan's computer chip market will be one of the first American-Japanese trade issues to confront Bill Clinton after his inauguration as President. His Administration will have to decide by midnight on Jan. 26, six days after it takes office, whether steel from Japan and other countries is being sold at unfairly low prices in the United States and should be subject to punitive import taxes.
The Clinton team will also have to decide by March 12 whether to confirm a preliminary ruling today by the Commerce Department that $130 million a year worth of circular saws, belt sanders and other electrical cutting and sanding tools from Japan are being sold here at unfairly low prices and should face an import tax of 39 to 41 percent. And some members of Congress also want to review Japan's mixed record of compliance with pledges on paper, computer and automobile trade made to President Bush when he visited Tokyo last January.
The overall United States trade deficit with Japan grew sharply this autumn and is likely to increase debate over whether to adopt a more confrontational approach to trade relations.
Japanese officials have acknowledged that bilateral trade relations could become more contentious early next year, while hoping that any fuss will be brief. The Kyodo News Service reported last week that Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said during the taping of a television show that the Clinton Administration "will probably say all sorts of things -- whenever there is a new Administration they always blow a lot of hot air, but after several months it quiets down."
Mrs. Hills announced today that imported computer chips or semiconductors accounted for 15.9 percent of the Japanese market in the third quarter, down marginally from 16 percent in the second quarter. Both figures are well below a target of 20 percent by the end of this year that was informally set in a bilateral pact a year and a half ago.
 
Report Scheduled in March
 Fourth-quarter figures on Japanese imports of computer chips will be tabulated by mid-March. The Clinton Administration will have the legal right to retaliate against Japanese exports if this figure falls short of 20 percent or to grant an extension of the deadline.
Mrs. Hills and her aides have never tried to prescribe exactly how Japanese companies should go about increasing purchases of foreign semiconductors. Japan is the only large semiconductor market in the world where American companies do not have a large share, and American Government and industry officials believe that the main reason lies in collusive arrangements between Japanese semiconductor makers and Japanese companies that use computer chips.
Seiichiro Noburu, the top economics official at the Japanese Embassy here, said that reaching the 20 percent figure would require a cooperative effort by Government and industry in both countries. He also said that the Japanese Government and industry hoped the foreign market share had grown in the fourth quarter.
Semiconductor negotiations between the United States and Japan have been acrimonious since the mid-1980's. The two countries signed a secret letter of understanding in 1986 calling for the foreign market share in Japan to reach 20 percent quickly, and President Ronald Reagan imposed 100 percent import taxes on $300 million worth of Japanese power tools and color televisions the following year when the American market share did not rise quickly.
Mrs. Hills and other Bush Administration officials dislike numerical targets for market share and gradually narrowed the quantity of Japanese tools and television sets that were subject to the taxes before eliminating the taxes entirely when last year's pact was struck. The agreement last year was more ambiguously phrased than the 1986 accord. This could make it difficult for the Clinton Administration to use it as the basis for trade sanctions.
Who will decide the semiconductor issue is still unclear. Mickey Kantor, Mr. Clinton's choice to become the next United States trade representative, may have to remove himself from the decision. His law firm, Manatt, Phelps, Phillips & Kantor, has registered with the Justice Department as a paid agent of the NEC Corporation, one of Japan's largest producers of semiconductors and other electronic equipment.
According to the law firm, Mr. Kantor did not personally work for NEC. But, faced with a similar situation, Mrs. Hills removed herself in her first year in office from all issues involving her former law firm even though Federal ethics guidelines did not require her to do so.
Joseph Massey, who was the assistant United States trade representative for China and Japan until last summer, said Mr. Kantor could make a strong case that the semiconductor issue is so important that he must decide it himself.
One Clinton Administration official with strong views on the subject is Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who was selected to head the Council of Economic Advisers. In an interview last year, she said that the agreement should have had a clause specifying specific sanctions if the 20 percent figure is not met.
But she also acknowledged then that the Japanese would probably not have accepted such a clause. "The fact that we've excluded sanctions suggests to me that we need to continue to push them," she said.
 
A Confrontational Mood
 The political atmosphere seems ripe for pushing the Japanese. The United States trade deficit with Japan widened in October to $4.96 billion, the largest gap in nearly four years.
The September deficit of $4.44 billion was also unusually large. Both of these monthly deficit figures were announced after the November elections and provoked little political reaction because Congress was not in session. But past surges in the bilateral deficit have tended to increase sentiment for a more confrontational trade policy.
Passage of the 1988 Trade Act came soon after the last peak in the bilateral deficit in 1987. The act included the so-called Super 301 provision and other rules that forced the Bush Administration to confront more foreign countries on trade policy than the Reagan Administration had.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Lumber Hits 13-Year High As Home Sales Move Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Lumber futures prices soared yesterday to a 13-year high on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid reports of constricted supplies and rising home sales.
Spruce 2-by-4's for January delivery surged 5 cents, the daily limit, to $277.20 for 1,000 board feet. It was the highest settlement for near-term deliveries since August 1979, when lumber futures hit a record high of $287.30. 
 Lumber futures have risen sharply in recent months, reflecting signs of a strengthening economy and sharply reduced logging on Federal timberland in the Northwest because of efforts to protect the habitat of the northern spotted owl.
Curt Cunningham, president of Pacific Futures Trading Inc.,said winter storms and extreme cold in the Northwest were hampering sawmill operations and further constricting the availability of lumber, driving up cash prices and forcing dealers into the futures market to secure supplies.
An industry trade group, the National Forest Products Association, said in an outlook Tuesday that lumber prices could reach a record high next yearunless the "stranglehold" on Federal timber sales is relaxed.
"At a time when demand for forest products shows definite signs of improving, the supply of timber in much of the West is at an all-time low," said Con Schallau, the association's chief economist.
Warm weather forecasts for the Northeast prompted a sharp drop in home heating oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange and helped drag other energy futures down.
February light crude oil fell 18 cents, to $19.64 a barrel; January heating oil tumbled 1.05 cents, to 56.79 cents a gallon; January unleaded gasoline dropped 0.39 cent, to 54.02 cents a gallon, and February natural gas fell 3.4 cents, to $1.701 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Frozen concentrated orange juice for January delivery plunged 4.15 cents, to 84.85 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange, extending Monday's steep loss as forecasts contain no threat of frost in the Florida Citrus Belt through at least the middle of next week.
Grain and soybean futures fell on the Chicago Board of Trade, extending the previous session's losses in a selloff led by speculative commodity funds.

HEADLINE: East to West, U.S. Consumer Spirits Rise

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The mood of consumers, which brightened considerably after the election in November, was even more upbeat in December.
The widely followed Conference Board index of consumer confidence jumped to 78.3 points, its highest level since April 1991, soon after the United States won the Persian Gulf war. 
 Optimism about future job growth is lifting spirits from New England to the West Coast.
 
'In Tulsa, People Feel Good'
 "Here in Tulsa, people feel good about the future in spite of the layoffs at American Airlines, McDonnell Douglas and Rockwell," said Mark Hunter, general manager of Woodland Hills shopping mall, the largest mall in Oklahoma. "There's more positive than negative news."
"It's a long-term feeling; it's here to stay," he added, noting that holiday sales grew 12 to 15 percent from last year.
Tulsa, where unemployment is below 6 percent, is way ahead of the rest of the country in spirits and spending, but there are other signs that Americans in virtually every region are feeling better about the economy.
One example: sales of existing homes -- the kind that represent most of the buying and selling in the residential real estate market -- leaped last month to the fastest pace since the mid-1980's, an annual rate of nearly 3.9 million single-family houses and apartments. Home sales were up 3.7 percent in the still depressed Northeast and 3.8 percent in the West.
The magnitude of the December spurt in confidence surprised almost everyone, including Fabian Linden, who is in charge of the Conference Board's 5,000-household survey and has watched past November surges in the wake of Presidential elections fade after a month or two.
"It would have been natural to expect some erosion in December," said Chris Probyn, an economic forecaster at Data Resources/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. "What happened is that expectations about the future just kept heading higher."
"People feel the Democrats are going to provide the answer for the economy," he added. "Confidence should stabilize now, but it will be vulnerable if policy gridlock develops in Washington."
Indeed, consumers in the survey were only mildly more upbeat than two months ago about current economic conditions, especially in the job market. Those who said jobs are scarce, for example, outnumbered by a huge margin those who found them abundant.
By contrast, consumers are a lot more hopeful that conditions will improve in the next six months or so. Expectations, as measured by one component of the Conference Board index, have jumped 34 points, to more than 100, since October.
Despite bad news on military and computer industry layoffs, 21.7 percent of households, compared with 13.5 percent in October, thought more jobs would be available six months hence, outnumbering those who thought fewer jobs would be available. Meanwhile, the job-market pessimists shrank from one quarter to one-sixth of the respondents.
The better mood suggests that consumers will keep spending, though hardly at the rapid pace of the last six months. Based on October and November Government data and anecdotal reports from retailers, spending probably grew at an annual rate after inflation of more than 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter. It rose at a rate of 3.7 percent in the summer.
"You'll still see decent spending gains at a 2 to 3 percent annual rate," said Deborah Johnson, an economist at C. J. Lawrence & Company.
The pace of spending is likely to settle down, simply because it has lately outstripped the growth of both jobs and wages and because Americans' savings rate is already low.
"You can only grow consumption faster than income for a short period of time," said Mr. Probyn of DRI/ McGraw Hill. "If the malaise in the job market continues, confidence will be vulnerable."
 
Weak Job Growth
 Though unemployment has declined to 7.2 percent, job growth has been extraordinarily weak by the standard of past economic recoveries. Like other forecasters, DRI/McGraw Hill does not expect the economy to grow fast enough to whittle away quickly at the jobless rate. "We're projecting growth, on average, of around 2.7 percent a year, and that's consistent with a very, very gradual downtrend in the unemployment rate," he said.
Retailers track confidence surveys closely for clues about spending trends. The Conference Board measure, which correctly signaled a temporary slump in spending a year ago, has not tracked this year's stop-and-go pattern in shopping very well.
One reason for thinking that the survey is picking up real improvement, however, is that the Conference Board report is consistent with the latest reading, for December, from the generally less volatile University of Michigan survey. The Michigan survey registered a substantial 5.7- point gain in December, after an advance of 12 points in November. More important, the Michigan index, which reached 91 points, is back within the range it registered during most of the long, strong 1980's expansion.

HEADLINE: C.D. Yields Unchanged For Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Most yields offered on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit for the week beginning today are unchanged from last week, according to the latest survey by The Bank Rate Monitor.
Analysts at the interest-rate publication said this holiday period would hold no surprises for depositors, since the Federal Reserve shows no signs of changing the current interest rate structure. And with loan demand down, banks are in no hurry to raise deposit rates to bring in cash. 
 At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills on Monday, average discount rates rose slightly. The auction is often considered a harbinger of deposit rate changes that banks could put into effect in the weeks ahead.
 
 
Auction Rate Up 6 Points
 The average rate at auction was up 6 basis points for both a three-month and six-month bill. The three-month Treasury bill was 3.22 percent, up from 3.16, and the six-month bill was at 3.38 percent, up from 3.32.
In the New York area, the average money market account was unchanged for the third consecutive week, yielding an average of 2.74 percent. The New York average for a three-month certificate remained 2.85 percent, while the average rose a basis point to 3.01 percent for a six-month certificate.
For the most part, all of the movement came from commercial banks, where rates are traditionally lower than those offered at savings banks. The average yield on a three-month C.D. rose a basis point, to 2.78 percent, and 2 basis points for a six-month C.D., to 2.92 percent.
The bank with the sharpest changes in C.D. yields is European American Bank, which raised its three-month yield 15 basis points, to 2.89 percent, and its six-month yield by 10 basis points, to 2.89 percent as well.
Outside the New York market, yields at 20 large banks remained steady for the third consecutive week, with the average yield on a money market account unchanged at 2.68 percent and an average six-month certificate also unchanged at 3.03 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on moneymarket accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, Dec. 30, 1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yield are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drifts Mostly Lower Despite Some Bullish Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower yesterday against most major currencies as the market ignored bullish economic reports that normally would have provided a lift.
Gold prices also fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery closed at $332.50 an ounce, down 40 cents. At Republic National Bank of New York, gold was quoted at $332.80 an ounce, off 20 cents. 
 Consumer confidence surged in December for the second straight month, the Conference Board, a business research group that tracks consumer sentiment, reported. In another positive economic report, a survey said retail sales had risen about 10 percent in the Christmas shopping season compared with last year.
But the currency market seemed to ignore the news, said Walter Simon, a vice president and currency trader at Bank Julius Baer & Company in New York. He said the market's movements at the end of year, as traders close out books, often bear little relationship to economic news.
In addition, the London financial markets reopened after a four-day weekend. The absence of London trading on Monday was believed to be part of the reason for the dollar's rise that day. Yesterday, with the return of the world's biggest foreign exchange market, the dollar "was brought lower to a more reasonable level," Mr. Simon said.
Traders said the dollar's movement both days had been exaggerated by the very thin trading volume during the holiday week.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.57 yen, up 0.64 yen from Monday's close. In Europe, it was quoted late yesterday at 124.65 yen. In New York, $1 bought 124.73 yen by late afternoon, down from 124.93 late Monday.
In Britain, the pound traded at $1.5090, down from $1.5350 on Thursday, when the market closed for the long weekend. In New York, 1 cost $1.5095, up from $1.5000 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, included: 1.61425 German marks, down from 1.6190; 1.4635 Swiss francs, down from 1.4670; 5.4955 French francs, down from 5.5160; 1,469.50 Italian lire, up from 1,453.50, and 1.26625 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2625.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday, included: 1.6165 marks, up from 1.6065; 1.4645 Swiss francs, up from 1.4540; 5.5060 French francs, up from 5.4727; 1.8155 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8055; 1,469.50 Italian lire, up from 1,441.00, and 1.2662 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2610.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY: A Year of Transitions;
Looking Beyond the Bloodletting in Biotechnology

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
For biotechnology, 1992 was a year in which the misses obscured the hits. The industry was beset by financial turmoil, the denial of regulatory approval for two once-promising drugs and rising concern about health-care costs. Over the entire 12 months, the Federal Government approved only two new biotech drugs.
With its constant appetite for cash, the industry continues to be ruled by the financial markets. After a roaring bull market in 1991, initial stock offerings by biotechnology companies peaked in January, but after some worrisome industry developments, they screeched to a halt in June. Still, some $6 billion in new capital had been raised in a mere 18 months, and with a flurry of new stock issues this fall investors seem to be returning to biotech issues. 
 "The market itself drove biotech to an incredible extent at the end of 1991 and the beginning of 1992," said Jeffrey Casdin, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company. "The slightest thing going wrong was going to cause an equally extreme reaction."
What did go wrong was anything but slight. In April, the Food and Drug Administration declined to approve Centoxin, Centocor Inc.'s drug for the treatment of septic shock, a deadly bacterial infection that strikes surgery patients and victims of severe burns or wounds. Then in June, the F.D.A. turned thumbs down on a competing drug from the Xoma Corporation. Both drugs, which had been highly touted and would have been each company's first product on the market, are monoclonal antibodies -- bioengineered versions of proteins the body uses to fight infections.
Centocor's and Xoma's stocks cratered. Centocor, which sold for $60.25 in January, subsequently traded as low as $9.50; it closed at $16 yesterday in over-the-counter trading. Xoma, which in February was bringing more than $25 a share, is only creeping back from its low for the year of $8.75; the stock closed yesterday at $9.50.
Both companies were handicapped by a lack of data showing reduced deaths in the general population of patients who were administered the drugs. Only among a subgroup of patients whose septic shock was caused by one type of bacteria was there a significant reduction in the number of deaths, and doctors have no way to determine the cause of the infection before giving the drug.
 The high cost -- about $3,750 a dose, in the case of Centoxin -- was also a concern. Even if the Xoma and Centocor treatments are eventually approved, most analysts predict they will be overtaken in the market by more powerful drugs that competitors are developing.
Falling between the Centocor and Xoma setbacks, the approval in early May of Interleukin-2 for the treatment of kidney cancer drew less attention than it probably deserved. This drug, too, had previously been turned down by the F.D.A., an action that ultimately led to the acquisition of its original producer, the Cetus Corporation, by the Chiron Corporation.
Besides Interleukin-2, already a moneymaker for Chiron, the only other biotech drug the F.D.A. approved this year was Recombinate, a genetically engineered copy of the blood-clotting protein factor that is missing from hemophiliacs' blood. The molecule, jointly developed by Genetics Institute Inc. and the Baxter Healthcare Corporation's Hyland division, received approval on Dec. 10, edging ahead of a competing effort under development by Genentech Inc. and Miles Pharmaceuticals Inc.
The bloodletting in the biotech industry in 1992 does not preclude better times in 1993. The next likely candidate for F.D.A. approval is beta interferon for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, a joint development of Chiron and Berlex, the United States division of Schering A.G. And many more drugs are in the process of completing clinical trials. Particularly promising are yet another septic-shock drug, this one from the Synergen Corporation, and a treatment for cystic fibrosis from Genentech.
"In an industry that is the next frontier, it is irrelevant to look at where we've been," said Viren Mehta, an analyst with Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Pharmaceutical Research. "I believe 1993 will be the beginning of another boom cycle."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY: A Year of Transitions;
Japan Inc.'s Struggle To Refill the Pipeline

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 29

 BODY:
Nineteen ninety-two will be remembered as the year the bullet train of Japanese technology was derailed. And there is no certainty that the once-vaunted industrial machine will get back on track in 1993.
With Japan in a severe economic slump, the nation's production of electronic equipment did not simply slow down in 1992, it actually declined -- a whopping 10.6 percent, according to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan. The trade group predicts growth of only 1.5 percent in 1993. 
 Companies are now preparing for what Akio Tanii, president of Matsushita, the consumer electronics giant, calls "stable growth": 5 percent or less, compared with more than 10 percent growth in the golden days of the recent past. Japanese corporations, however reluctantly, are eliminating marginal businesses and gradually cutting thousands of people from their work forces.
 
Needs a Hot New Product
 Even once the economy recovers, starting perhaps late next year, Japan will have competitive problems in technology. The consumer electronics business is suffering not only from the recession but from product saturation. The industry desperately needs a new hit product to fuel growth, but no obvious candidate is in the pipeline.
Two new music formats, Sony's mini-disk and Philips' digital compact cassette, both got off to slow starts in the Christmas shopping season. High-definition television, the great wide hope, is still several years away, and Japan's analog approach to HDTV looks to be circumvented by new digital techniques developed in the United States. And American companies are taking surprisingly strong positions in pioneering consumer electronics markets like new kinds of mobile phones, highly portable computers and handheld electronic organizers.
In computers especially, the big problems are only beginning for the Japanese -- especially companies like Fujitsu and Hitachi, which have spent decades chasing I.B.M. in the mainframe business and now seem destined to be sucked into the vortex as that market is drained off by smaller machines linked in networks.
In personal computers, meanwhile, the Compaq Computer Corporation of Houston invaded the Japanese market this fall with machines selling for as little as half the price of those made by the NEC Corporation, the Japanese company that controls more than half of its home market.
Even in semiconductors, the American companies are once again gaining market share after seeing it eroded by Japan for years. In software, long the American industry's strength, Japan still relies too heavily on expensive and time-consuming customized programs, rather than on prepackaged products.
It would be foolish, of course, to write off Japan. Even if personal communicators, high-definition televisions, flash memory chips and other new products are designed in the United States, Japanese companies will be major manufacturers.
And while they have been slashing capital investments to conserve cash, Japanese companies have made much smaller trims in research and development -- a reflection of the forward thinking that made Japan such a technological power in the first place.

HEADLINE: High-Tech Goliaths Taking Pains to Act Small

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
In a year of paring down and scaling back by big technology companies, it would have been hard to imagine a worse time for Corporate America's largest spenders on research and development: General Motors and I.B.M. Thick wallets, it seems, are no match for flexibility and market savvy in the hunt for payoffs from technology investments.
That hard lesson was driven home with considerable force in 1992, undermining the old-line giants and the very notion that size is an advantage in technology industries. The competitive landscape can shift so quickly that large companies with legions of bureaucrats prove unable to keep up. Old-line giants like G.M., I.B.M. and General Dynamics are trimming their operations and even selling off large pieces of themselves. 
The aim is to become more entrepreneurial, hoping to keep pace with technological trends and bring products to market faster. In short, the giants are trying to act small. "If you don't cannibalize yourself, somebody else will, because the pace of change is so fast," said Charles Ferguson, a consultant based in Cambridge, Mass.
 
 
Japan's Giants Also Trip
 This year has not been a time of big technological breakthroughs, but a transitional period in which various industries have reshaped themselves for the future. And the evidence that size may be a hindrance in high-tech industries is by no means confined to America. The advance of the Japanese electronics giants in the semiconductor industry, for instance, was once deemed inevitable. But while they dominate the memory side of the market, the Japanese have not been able to make headway in the more innovative microprocessors, the so-called brains of computers.
It is an American company -- Intel, of course -- that rules the microprocessor market. For their part, the Japanese chip makers have not been able to match even the inroads of the Cyrix Corporation, a start-up that was founded in 1988 by two former Texas Instrument engineers in Richardson, Tex., and has since become a leading maker of clones of Intel's 386-and 486-series chips.
On the policy front, adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement would leave its mark on high-tech companies, but probably not with the loss of American jobs to Mexico that some critics fear. F. William Finan, president of Technecon Analytic Research in Washington, notes that in terms of lower-skill operations like the assembly and testing of semiconductors, American companies made their decisions years ago about whether to move offshore.
Rather, the jobs impact of the trade agreement may well be to shift offshore activity to Mexico from Asian assembly sites like Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. "The Asian economies may be the losers from Mexico opening up," Mr. Finan said.
The transition in technology is also evident in the new emphasis on training American workers. The motivation is not a humanistic concern for employees' self-esteem, but the realization that well-trained people make possible more flexible production than factories crowded with robots. That represents a turnabout from the 1980's, when companies like G.M. bet billions on a robotic future.
Instead, the new face of high-tech manufacturing is more likely represented by Dell Computer's factory in Austin, Tex., where robots are scarce, people are plentiful, assembly lines can be changed during a lunch hour and manufacturing does not begin until a customer places an order. In the Dell model of manufacturing, tailored orders can be as small as a single personal computer.
Despite the belt-tightening by some big companies and seemingly the entire military-contracting industry, the nation's overall research-and-development spending held up remarkably well in 1992, as smaller but faster-growing high-tech companies picked up the slack. Private-industry research and development spending increased 1.6 percent for the year, adjusted for inflation, to $130.8 billion, according to estimates by DRI/McGraw-Hill.
That money, spent in this year of transition, could lead to big product breakthroughs in the years ahead.

HEADLINE: BRAZILIAN LEADER QUITS AS HIS TRIAL STARTS IN SENATE

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Dec. 29

 BODY:
Fernando Collor de Mello resigned as President of Brazil today, ending eight months of political turmoil in Latin America's largest nation only minutes after the Brazilian Senate had begun an impeachment trial he was all but certain to lose.
 Three hours after the resignation, Vice President Itamar Franco was sworn in as President by the Brazilian Congress. Mr. Franco, a gentlemanly, little-known former Senator, is to serve out the rest of Mr. Collor's term, which ends in January 1995. [Man in the News, page A8.] 
He has been wielding presidential powers since Oct. 2 when the lower house of the Congress impeached Mr. Collor and ordered him to stand trial in the Senate on charges of taking part in an influence-peddling ring that netted millions of dollars for the President and his family and friends.
 
One Sentence Ends It
 In a one-sentence letter to the Senate, Mr. Collor said, "I herewith notifyyou that at this date and through this document I resign the office of President of the Republic to which I was elected."
 During his 12 weeks in power, many Brazilians have accused Mr. Franco of indecisiveness and a tendency to slow or reverse Mr. Collor's program to reduce state control over the Brazilian economy, the world's ninth largest.
 But when he appeared in Congress today for his swearing-in, he was met with continual cheers, chants and the singing of the national anthem by lawmakers and young Brazilians who had filled the gallery.
 "The nightmare is finally over," said Amir Lando, chief coordinator of the Collor investigation and a Senator from the northwest state of Rondonia. "The nation can sleep peacefully tonight."
 
'Such Maturity,' Senator Says
 Mr. Collor's resignation, announced by his lawyer, reflects a growing public intolerance in Brazil and other Latin American countries for politicians who enrich themselves while in office at the expense of the taxpayers. Heads of state in Venezuela, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay have all faced public outcries over charges of corruption.
 "I don't know of any political episode that has been handled by a society with such maturity," said Mario Covas, a Social Democratic Senator from Sao Paulo.
 Mr. Collor, 43, was charged with receiving $6.5 million in bribes solicited by his family and friends in return for political favors. When made public in May, the accusations seemed to galvanize the public and political parties alike. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Brazil's major cities demanding his ouster.
 Mr. Collor, who in 1989 won Brazil's first presidential elections in 30 years on a platform of clean government, consistently denied the charges, saying that while his colleagues may have solicited bribes on his behalf he was not aware of the scheme.
 Congressional investigators charged Mr. Collor and his family with receiving $8 million from an influence-peddling ring that netted more than $55 million.
 
Trial Postponement Denied
 As the trial in the Senate began today, Mr. Collor's lawyer asked for a postponement, which was denied. The senators were hearing the first witness when the lawyer announced to them that the President had resigned.
 The Senate then adjourned to permit the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, to accept the resignation, but it reconvened late this afternoon and voted 73 to 8 to continue the trial.
 [The Senate heard testimony late into the night and then voted 76-3 to convict Mr. Collor, The Associated Press reported.]
 Several senators expressed a desire to see Mr. Collor not only removed from office but also prohibited from holding elected office for the next eight years, a restriction imposed by a conviction, which required only 54 votes.
 Mr. Collor is also likely to face criminal charges that could lead to imprisonment. He has repeatedly described the Senate hearings as a kangaroo court.
 "This is not a good day for Brazil," said Ney Maranhao, a Senator from Mr. Collor's National Reconstruction Party. "It is a coup d'etat."
 Maria Teresa Teixeira, a spokeswoman for Mr. Collor, told reporters outside his lavish home in Brasilia that he had received 800 telegrams of support on Monday but had resigned because "he did not have a chance to defend himself and would lose eight years of his political rights if he did not resign."
 She added, "He is emotional, as you would expect."
 
'He Is Suffering,' Aide Says
 Another Collor aide, Etevaldo Dias, said Mr. Collor made the decision to resign at 7:45 this morning. "He has been hit and he is suffering," Mr. Dias said.
 There was speculation that Mr. Collor would soon leave for Paris, where he has an apartment valued at $1.7 million.
 "This is a landmark event," said Loise Retzek, a Government worker who was standing with her small son outside the Congress building today. She said that until now corrupt Government officials had always enjoyed impunity. "Now we have hope that people can express their voices and be heard," she said.
 She added that the resignation was a victory for the young people who clamored against Mr. Collor. "They went to the streets, they called for the impeachment and they won," she said.
 While obviously relieved by the effective ending of the eight-month political crisis, Brazil faces an uncertain economic future. The country is mired in a two-year-old recession that economists predict will last at least through 1993, and inflation has been running at almost 25 percent a month, or 1,500 percent annually.
 Perhaps of most concern to economists, Mr. Franco is not known as a strong economic policy maker. Some even describe him as an economic novice. He has troubled many with statements in recent weeks that he is more concerned about growth than inflation and that he will halt the selling of state-run businesses.
 
Privatizations in Danger
 Mr. Franco has promised that more attention will be given the very poor and has called for an increase in the minimum wage from $50 to $100 a month on Jan. 1, a step that is likely to increase inflation.
 "I think the strategy is to make privatizations so difficult that the whole thing will be effectively stopped," said Alexandre Barros, a political consultant here.
 While Mr. Collor did not fulfill his campaign promises of a clean government, he did make some progress in modernizing Brazil's economy.
 Early in 1990 inflation was running at 80 percent a month. During his first two and a half years in office, Mr. Collor began privatizing state-owned businesses, reached agreements with Brazil's creditor commercial banks and the International Monetary Fund on an economic stabilization plan and opened the country more to free trade with neighboring countries like Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
 Foreign investors, who had shied away from Brazil after it began to stagger under the weight of its economic problems and a $115 billion foreign debt, began to return.
 
A Champion of the Indians
 Though unsuccessful in eliminating inflation, Mr. Collor brought it down to under 10 percent monthly at times, and earned the confidence of international bankers.
 A handsome, dashing and elegant figure, he flew air force jets, drove motorcycles and jet skis, jogged and held a black belt in karate.
 More important, he championed the cause of the Brazilian Indians, doubling their homelands. He reduced the rate of deforestation of the Amazon and dismantled Brazil's nuclear weapons program.
 But his downfall was spectacular. Though he won on an image of honesty, prosecutors at his impeachment trial were prepared to prove that from early on his top campaign aide, Paulo Cesar Farias, was forcing businessmen to pay large bribes to win Government contracts.
 Mr. Collor, who was born to a wealthy family in the northeastern state of Alagoas, maintains he knew nothing of the scheme, even though Government investigators uncovered more than 40,000 checks for kickbacks made out to bank accounts controlled by Mr. Collor or his associates. But his life style clearly demonstrated income beyond the $33,000 he earned from his office.

HEADLINE: A Taxing Tax Credit for the Poor

 BODY:
The earned income tax credit is a jewel of an anti-poverty weapon. It supplements the earnings of low-paid parents. And it encourages work, because the credit goes only to workers.
The only flaw is that many families don't know they're eligible and don't apply. That problem could mushroom with 1992 filings because of a changed policy in the Internal Revenue Service. 
 Families earning less than $22,000 with at least one child living at home are eligible. The credit, which can be as much as $2,200, is applied against the family's income tax bill. Families that owe no tax get the benefit in cash.
Eligible families are supposed to file Schedule EIC along with their ordinary tax form. Last year, the I.R.S. calculated the credit for families that filed tax forms but did not file Schedule EIC. But for 1992, the I.R.S. has declared: No form, no credit. The I.R.S. will send a useful reminder -- a blank form -- to filers it thinks eligible.
The new policy could drive away many needy families because Schedule EIC is intimidating. And many unemployed workers will be newly eligible but unfamiliar with the requirements. Millions of eligible families that don't file tax returns because their income is too low won't get the blank-form reminder. Nor will many families know to fill out another required form in time to get the credit applied to next year's paychecks.
Fortunately, there's help. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group, provides excellent materials to groups that work with low-income families. And local offices of Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, or VITA, will fill out the forms free.
The credit works beautifully -- but only for those who work their way through the complex forms. They can get the benefits due them if employers, social service agencies and other friends help them through the maze.

HEADLINE: Peruvian State Iron Company Finds a 'Private' Buyer: China

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JUAN DE MARCONA, Peru

 BODY:
This old mining town in the southern desert, for decades home to Peru's struggling state-controlled iron company, has a new owner in what Government officials and investment bankers describe as a one-of-a-kind acquisition.
The buyer is a Chinese state-owned corporation, which with the permission of the Communist leaders in Beijing competed with Western financial interests to take over the iron maker. In a single stroke, the Chinese became the second-largest foreign investors in Peru, behind an American company, the Southern Peru Copper Corporation. 
 Their Peruvian investment reflects China's determination to buy corporate assets quickly. The growth of the Chinese economy is so rapid, and its industrial base so underdeveloped, that buying steel mills, iron mines and other Western businesses is far easier than waiting until such industries can be developed within China, say investment bankers and executives of the Capital Steel Corporation of Beijing, which concluded the deal here.
A multibillion-dollar iron and steel company, Capital Steel beat out a Chilean-Mexican-Japanese consortium by bidding $312 million for the Peruvian company, Hierroperu S.A. The deal is Peru's first major sale of a state-owned industrial enterprise.
While the losing bidders and some others said the Chinese had paid far too much, the supply of rich iron ore and its proximity to the coast, which greatly reduces transportation costs, proved a strong attraction.
But the Chinese will most likely have to contend with Peru's Shining Path guerrilla organization. The Maoist group maintains a presence in the region and opposes foreign investment in Peru.
[Shining Path accuses China of having abandoned Mao's ideals, and on Dec. 26 it exploded a car bomb near the Chinese Embassy in Lima.]
Chinese investment in overseas companies is not new; the China International Trust and Investment Company bought a timber operation in Seattle and a huge aluminum smelter in Australia in the mid 1980's and a steel mill in Delaware a few years later. But Capital Steel officials say that the acquisition is the largest single foreign investment by the Chinese Government outside Asia and the northern Pacific.
Capital Steel, also known by its Chinese name, Shougang, which had profits of $500 million in 1991, agreed earlier this year to buy an entire steel mill in Los Angeles, dismantle it and reconstruct it in China. The company also agreed to buy and relocate to China two steelmaking furnaces in Pennsylvania from the USX Corporation.
China, which consumes around 70 million tons of iron a year, is the third-largest user in the world after Japan and the United States. And unlike steel demand in those two countries, which is barely growing, Chinese demand for iron and steel is rising at 15 percent a year. Securing an adequate and stable supply was critical for future economic growth.
 
Chinese Demand and Capacity
 Overall economic growth in China, averaging 7 to 10 percent in recent years and 12 percent in 1992, is creating a potential new economic power. For a nation of more than a billion people, this growth implies a demand for iron and steel that far outstrips China's ability to develop its own mines, Capital Steel officials say.
The deal "is part of China's policy of opening to the world markets," a Capital Steel official said in a telephone interview from Beijing.
An American law firm that represents Capital Steel in the United States and Latin America said the company was actively looking for other assets in North and South America and had already agreed to buy some steel furnaces and other large-scale equipment.
"I don't know of any other Chinese company doing this," said Clayton Sweeney, managing director of the Pittsburgh law firm of Dickie, McCamey & Chilcote, which represented Capital Steel in the Peruvian acquisition. "China's internal growth rate is about the fastest of any developing country, so we will see more of this type of deal."
The Capital Steel purchase comes in a year in which the Chinese have ventured for the first time into Western capital markets in other ways. On Oct. 9 an underwriting syndicate led by the First Boston Corporation sold $80 million in stock of the Chinese mini-van manufacturer, Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd. The shares, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, represented the first public stock offering by a Chinese company on a United States exchange.
 
'Just the Beginning'
 "This is just the beginning of the Chinese presence in the world capital markets," said one New York investment banker involved in the Hierroperu deal. "When we were sitting around a table and the offer was first discussed, we sat back and thought this had to be a first -- the agent of a Communist regime participating in the free-market sale of a state-run company."
Capital Steel officials say their company, which employs 200,000 people, holds a special status within the Chinese economy, and its overseas venture is probably an experiment to see how smoothly a transition can be made from a closed, planned economy into one with wide-ranging connections to international markets.
Earlier this year, Deng Xiaoping, the 88-year-old Chinese leader, visited the company's headquarters in Beijing and agreed to give Capital Steel executives autonomy over their business operations, a promise that later was formally approved by the Government. Now, Capital Steel is permitted to invest at least half of its profits abroad and does not have to fulfill state production goals.
The company wasted little time in making deals. This fall, it agreed to buy an entire steel mill from California Steel Inc. of Los Angeles and move it to a steel works in the Shandong Province; a short time later it bought the two Pittsburgh furnaces. Then in early November it entered the bidding for Hierroperu.
For Capital Steel the move was a search for its own kind of El Dorado -- only the treasure is not yellow, but rather a charcoal-and-brown iron ore that permeates the land around San Juan, some 250 miles south of Lima.
 
Triple the Assessed Value
 In a deal that left Chilean, Mexican and Japanese investors incredulous, the $312 million that Capital Steel agreed to pay is almost three times the assessed price for Hierroperu.
"It is unbelievable that they are paying that much," said Glen Trebilcock, executive vice president of Compania Mineros del Pacifico, which teamed up with Mitsubishi of Japan and Imexsa of Mexico in a losing bid. "At the prices the Chinese are paying, it would be better to buy iron on the world market."
Indeed, gazing down into the vast open pits, striated with blushes of red, brown and charcoal gray, the question that many in the industry are asking is whether the antiquated operation is worth that much.
Managers say that because of a dearth of investment in recent years the mine is operating at about only 40 percent of capacity. Of a fleet of 32 huge dump trucks, about half were out of service for lack of money to buy spare parts like rear-view mirrors and tires.
Still, there seems to be a strong economic strategy behind the Beijing Government's getting into the Latin American privatization game. China needs not only natural resources but the corporate organizations to exploit them.
"There are not that many iron ore reserves and companies for sale in the world," said Emilio Zuniga, president of Hierroperu. "So the sale of Hierroperu came just at the right time for them."
 
Plan to Increase Production
 Under the contract, Capital Steel has agreed to pay $120 million in cash, invest $150 million over the next three years and assume $42 million of Hierroperu debt. The company has also discussed possibly increasing that investment to $300 million, which would include building a steel plant at the port of San Nicolas.
Capital Steel has announced plans to increase production at Hierroperu from the current level of more than 2 million tons a year to 10 million tons, and eventually to 15 million to 20 million tons.
Middle-level managers here are estatic that the Chinese will be pouring new investment into Hierroperu. Even the historically militant unions, which have staged hunger strikes to protest falling wages, layoffs and a steady deterioration of their company-built homes in San Juan, are rejoicing.

HEADLINE: Britain Warns Serbs of Risk of Armed Intervention

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 30

 BODY:
The British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, delivered his sharpest warning to Serbian leaders today, declaring that their "bloody-minded cruelty" had raised the risk of military intervention in Bosnia by the Western allies.
While he argued that he still "distrusted" the idea of the West's trying to force a settlement in the former Yugoslavia, Mr. Hurd said continued action by the Serbs, as well as the growing risk of a wider conflict in the region, had forced what he described as "a change" in Western attitudes. 
 "They have brought even those of us who hold that view to the point where we can imagine armed action against them to prevent a general Balkan war," Mr. Hurd said in an article appearing today in The Daily Telegraph.
Until now, Mr. Hurd and Prime Minister John Major have emphasized the need to seek a political solution in Bosnia by tightening economic and political sanctions against the Serbs rather than by military action.
The British have said they fear that increased military activity in Bosnia might threaten relief activities and expose some 1,800 British troops there to the risk of Serbian retaliation. The British soldiers are serving with a United Nations peacekeeping mission that escorts food and medicine to besieged Bosnian towns.
The British Government has flatly opposed the use of combat troops and has been wary of plans, supported by the United States, to use combat aircraft to enforce United Nations sanctions barring Serbian aircraft from flying over Bosnia.
In his article today, Mr. Hurd repeated his belief that a way needed to be found to enforce the air-exclusion zone without endangering the relief effort.
A spokeswoman at the British Foreign Office today said Mr. Hurd's remarks did not signal any fundamental shift in British policy toward Bosnia as the United Nations Security Council studies whether to step up military pressure against the Serbs.
"It is not a departure from current Government policy," the spokeswoman said, adding that Mr. Hurd was not suggesting that Britain is now prepared to endorse military intervention.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
The New Year at a New Age Retreat: The Clintons in Agreeable Company

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HILTON HEAD, S.C., Dec. 30

 BODY:
The sight of the President-elect and the First Lady-elect arriving here today with monogrammed (BC and HRC) matching overstuffed boxes of work papers to celebrate New Year's Eve by talking about "personal and national renewal" with 1,500 friends invites the question:
Is America really ready for the Renaissance? 
 Can the politesse of an intellectual salon replace "Where's mine?" in American politics? Is the average Congressman evolved enough in his quest for personal renewal to embrace the manners of the group encounter? If the time has come for New Age politics, what will be done with all the Old Age politicians? Can the reasoned, reasonable talk of the Renaissance Weekend replace the pushing, grasping, gouging ways of Washington?
The Renaissance Weekend, the four-day symposium that brought the Clintons here this week, began 12 years ago in the mind of a man named Philip Lader, who was then president of the Sea Pines Plantation, the prototype resort of this most planned of all communities. Mr. Lader, whose work had taught him the value of both group consensus and making friends, had a vision that was at once practical and utopian.
 
Influential 'Extended Family'
 On the practical level, he thought it would be a good thing to establish a network, with himself at the center, of a lot of influential, well-connected, very successful people.
On the utopian side, he proposed to structure this network -- or "extended family," as he called it -- not around any gatherings where fun was had for fun's sake, but around annual "weekend retreats" in which the participants would be "open and sharing of their vulnerabilities and toward the building of an inner life."
He figured the way to "personal and national renewal" lay in the redemptive power of stimulating conversation, and he designed a program around four very long days of group discussions covering everything from the most contentious of public policies to the most personal of family matters.
With such a range, it would seem Renaissance Weekend chats could get ugly, but they never do. They are free and frank and open, yet very civilized. This is by painstaking design. All of the people involved every year, who pay $325 for couples or $250 for individuals, are selected to fit in with Mr. Lader's design, and those who are too pushy for themselves or their beliefs one year are, as they say here, "disinvited" the next.
Bill Clinton, eight-year Renaissance Weekend veteran, always fit in perfectly, his fellow talkers say. Indeed, they say, the Renaissance Spirit (it is a phrase that somehow comes out capitalized) is the spirit of the Clinton age.
"The idea of the Renaissance Spirit is that there can be a diversity of ideas but that it should be done on very friendly terms, where you respect where people are coming from, in a way that is similar to the sort of English drawing room discussion I experienced at Oxford," said Tom Schneider, an 11-year participant. "To the extent that there is any ideology involved, people know that there are limits and that you don't have to win. The relationships are the important thing, and you don't want to take any disagreement to the point where it might destroy relationships."
On Tuesday afternoon, shortly after the Clintons arrived for their six-day vacation built around Renaissance Weekend, Mr. Schneider ran into his old friend Mr. Clinton. The two men chatted about Mr. Clinton's recent economic conference in Little Rock, Ark., at which Mr. Schneider was a guest, and Mr. Clinton compared it to a much smaller event a little more than a year before: a fund-raiser that Mr. Schneider arranged at his Washington law firm for the newly announced Presidential candidate Bill Clinton.
"For that fund-raiser, I had the idea of making it like Renaissance Weekend, a friendly, open issues discussion," Mr. Schneider recalled. "Talking to Bill yesterday, he connected the economic summit back to that. He said the economic summit was just like that first fund-raiser, but 10 times larger. And then he said, 'And that's what the Renaissance is really like.' And he's right. In real terms, the economic summit was modeled on an art form that was developed down here."
Mr. Schneider's point seems well taken. The 19-hour economic conference he was host to in Little Rock last month was strikingly in keeping with the Renaissance Weekend model.
 
Courtesy Is Central
 Of the more than 300 attendees at the economic conference, many expressed opinions diverging from one another, but none expressed a point of view fundamentally in opposition to the central suppositions on the table and in favor of the conservative, Republican approach to economics: less taxes, smaller Government. Although the guest list included Democrats whose ideologies made them theoretical enemies, the tone of the gathering was one of determined amity.
This seems to be a very Renaissance way of doing things. In the panel discussions (with topics and participants selected by Mr. Lader and his wife, Linda), diversity of views is encouraged, but only, as Mr. Schneider suggested, to a polite point.
"We had one person I will not name who was disinvited after inappropriate behavior last year," said Jackie Kiss, the coordinator of Renaissance Weekend. "She had her own agenda. She didn't listen. She tried to take over meetings. She had no interest in really listening to the views of others."
Ms. Kiss said there was never remotely any such problem with Mr. Clinton.
"I remember the first time I was introduced to him," she recalled. "He was talking when I met him, but he stopped and listened to me -- really listened -- and then we talked. And he never stopped talking. He just kept on talking and talking and talking and talking. He was really in his element."
But will the President-elect's interpersonal skills, while admittedly impressive, work as well with members of the population who are not Renaissance material? There are, after all, a lot of them. Leaving gender aside, Ms. Kiss's description of the disinvited guest would seem to fit many of the people Mr. Clinton will be dealing with in the next four years. Senators, for example. Also labor leaders, foreign potentates, corporate giants, interest-group activists and a good many voters. Even in England, where Mr. Schneider (and perhaps his fellow Oxonian Mr. Clinton) learned the manners of drawing room conversation, the Parliament is notoriously rude.
 
Not Exactly Governance
 In governance, it is difficult to restrict the guest list, and almost impossible to disinvite the argumentative. Rather often, it is necessary to abandon reason altogether, in favor of the more universally understood language of force.
Nevertheless, the believers in Renaissance are hopeful that the spirit of rationalism will move the masses toward betterment.
"I think the fundamental vision of democracy is that politics is a matter of rational persuasion," said Ronald Thiemann, dean of the Harvard Divinity School. "That was clearly the view of the best of the Federalists. They also understood, of course, that force was sometimes necessary, but they knew that any force had to rest on a base of rational discussion, the sort of thing that is cultured in settings like this one."
No doubt. But there are some, even in the Renaissance, who suggest the whole thing has gotten to the point where it takes itself a little too seriously.
"This used to be just a laid-back weekend of people who had nothing to do and didn't want to put on a black tie on New Year's Eve, and now it's become the Trilateral Commission to Solve the Problems of the World," said the humorist Art Buchwald, a participant of five years' standing. "Nobody used to pay any attention to the panels. Nobody took them seriously. Now, they'll all be reading the fine print to see what Clinton will do as President."
Mr. Buchwald, whose most significant contribution to the weekend's policy discussions thus far has been a "heartfelt plea" for more public toilets in America, confided a secret.
"Listen," he said, "in the old days, even the Clintons didn't take the panels seriously. I'm telling you, nobody even listened."

HEADLINE: Brazilian Vows to Fight as New Leader Takes Over

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Dec. 30

 BODY:
The day after he resigned as President of Brazil and hours after being convicted of corruption by the Senate in an impeachment trial, Fernando Collor de Mello lashed out at his political opponents today, defended his Government and promised to appeal his conviction to the Supreme Court.
In an evident attempt to upstage Brazil's new President, Itamar Franco, Mr. Collor went on national television this morning directly after Mr. Franco had made his inaugural speech to the country and while he was holding a news conference. 
 The ousted President called his enemies the "new coup mongers of the left and old right-wing nonconformists" and vowed to remain in the country to defend his policies.
"I have not stopped the fight," an emotional Mr. Collor said as he stood in the small library near his Brasilia ranch house. His wife, Rosane, and his closest political allies were at his side.
 
'A Tranquil Conscience'
 "The inequities I have suffered have hurt my honor and that of the post I exercised," he said. "My judgment will be in history. I have a tranquil conscience."
He called the impeachment process a "summary execution" and said, "I have been publicly lynched."
Aides to Mr. Collor said his impeachment had troubled him deeply, causing him many sleepless nights.
The former President and his successor seemed to take on the air of rivals playing for the nation's attention: an angry Mr. Collor standing in front of reporters with an attitude that indicated he was almost unaware that he was no longer head of state, and a calm and paternalistic Mr. Franco as he addressed this country of 150 million people and promised that his Government would seek to redress the nation's poverty.
"We cannot look upon our very poor with the pity we have for those caught in misery, but with the feeling that we are facing people like us, companions of the same destiny within the same landscape, under the same sky and under the same history," Mr. Franco said.
 
'Jungle Capitalism' Assailed
 Mr. Franco criticized Mr. Collor's Government for letting the income of Brazil's poorest citizens fall more than 10 percent in the last 30 months.
He promised that Brazil would honor its international debt commitments, like those to the International Monetary Fund and the commercial banks. But he also took a swipe at business.
"We are looking for enlightened businessmen who consider business as an instrument for social progress, not as a mere fount of profit," he said. "We don't want among us those who practice jungle capitalism, predators who oppress us and dissipate fortunes."
The speech was typical of what many here have come to expect of Mr. Franco, a 62-year-old politician who is likely to adopt public-spending programs to aid the estimated 90 million poor in Brazil, even at the risk of pushing up inflation.
His aides said today that he would not consider lowering inflation the No. 1 objective. Rather, they said, he would concentrate on igniting economic growth in Brazil and creating jobs.
 
Businessmen Express Concern
 Businessmen have expressed concern that Mr. Franco's policies could aggravate Brazil's rampant inflation, now running at 25 percent a month, and continue the recession through the end of 1993.
President Itamar -- he is called that here to avoid any confusion with Francisco Franco, the Spanish dictator who died in 1975 -- also made it clear he would seek to move his economic policy in a different direction from that of Mr. Collor. He promised no economic shock package like a wage and price freeze, which Mr Collor tried. And he questioned the idea of modernizing Brazil, Mr. Collor's favorite economic theme.
"We all want to modernize our country, and we will modernize, but not by impoverishing the middle class and aggravating the sacrifice of the workers," he said.
And taking what seemed a snipe at his predecessor, Mr. Franco said, "I want to tell the nation that the time of almost imperial powers is over, hopefully forever, so that we can start a time of de facto shared responsibility between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary."
For his part, Mr. Collor faces a highly uncertain future. Though he tried to evade an impeachment conviction by resigning before the Senate reached a verdict, the lawmakers, many openly angry at his conduct in office, insisted on holding the trial.
After almost 15 hours of deliberations, they finally voted at 4:30 this morning, overwhelmingly convicting Mr. Collor by 76 to 3 on charges of official misconduct. The conviction means that Mr. Collor is unable to hold political office for eight years.
The only institution that can overthrow such a conviction is the country's Supreme Court.
By resigning, Mr. Collor has also been stripped of his political immunity. He, his wife, and his former campaign treasurer, Paulo Cesar Farias, all face criminal charges that could end in eight-year prison sentences. The Supreme Court has asked Mr. Collor to notify it if he plans to leave the country.
According to congressional investigators, Mr. Farias was the operator of an influence-peddling scheme that netted more than $55 million, of which at least $8 million went to Mr. Collor and his family.
 
'A Turning Point'
 Brazilians appeared less celebratory than relieved today that the nation was able to remove a President through legal and peaceful means, and hopeful that the Franco Government would close the book on official corruption.
Mr. Collor, a little-known politician at the time of his upset victory in 1989, ran on a clean-government platform.
"The society looked at this episode as a turning point to show that justice reaches also the powerful and that impunity should not be a given," said an editorial in Falho de Sao Paulo, the newspaper with the country's largest circulation.
Besides being what his aides described as wounded, the former President is also isolated from much of his family. It was in fact his younger brother, Pedro, who in May first brought accusations of corruption against Mr. Collor.
Speaking by telephone from his office in Miami, Pedro Collor said he was shocked when he heard that his brother had resigned.
"For six months he said he would never resign, that it would be the equivalent of admitting responsibility and culpability," he said. "As recently as two days ago, he told his closest allies he would never resign. Now he has lost all credibility."
 
Family Is Divided
 Pedro Collar said that in the wake of the accusations against his brother, any warm relations within the Collor de Mello family ceased to exist, as the three brothers and two sisters split into factions.
Pedro Collor had headed the family's media company in the northern city of Alagoas. After he disclosed the corruption in his brother's Government, however, Leda Collor de Mello, their mother and the controlling shareholder, removed him on the ground that he was mentally incompetent.
In response, Pedro Collor underwent psychiatric testing in Sao Paulo, but a clean bill of mental health did not win him back his position as president of the family company. It is now nearly bankrupt and could shut down early next year, putting hundreds of people out of work.
Pedro Collor said he had not communicated with his brother for almost a year. He added that their oldest brother, Leopoldo, had been named as being involved in illegally importing luxury cars into Brazil and recently left the country to spend time in Florida.

The Economy
The U.S. leading-indicators index jumped 0.8% in November, its second straight advance and the biggest in 10 months, the Government reported. The data support a widely held belief that the economic expansion has become self-sustaining. [Page D1.] 
 New-home sales fell 8.3 percent in November, the second consecutive drop and the worst in eight months. [D4.]
Worries arise over banks' sale of stocks and mutual funds. The big concern: many consumers may not fully understand the risks. Some experts also fear that the shift of money into such funds will draw down the deposits that banks use to make loans. [D1.]
 
 Companies
I.B.M., stung by criticism, will fight back with ads that attempt to reach directly to customers and communicate its self-image as a leaner, more responsive computer giant. The two-page advertisement offers an answer to the question "What's really going on at I.B.M.?" [D1.]
"Crazy Eddie" Antar will to return to face U.S. charges, his lawyer said. The fugitive consumer electronics executive, who fled to Israel in 1990, is accused of fraud and racketeering. [D3.]
Gerber Products will sell Buster Brown, its children's apparel unit, to the subsidiary's management and two investment groups in a deal estimated at nearly $100 million. [D3.]
South Carolina is investigating Ross Cosmetics' new president, pulling a current executive into a controversy that previously touched only former Ross board members. [D3.]
BT, the British phone company, begins a one-month price cut at midnight to mark the unification of European markets. The state-owned carriers on the Continent, loath to cut rates, are not expected to follow suit. [D3.]
Yamaha says its computerized grand piano has a market: middle-aged music lovers, mostly male and decidedly affluent, who had never dreamed of playing an instrument. [D3.]
 
 International
A symbol of China's determination to invest overseas is its recent purchase of a state-controlled iron company in Peru. In a single stroke, the Chinese have become that country's second-largest foreign investor. [A1.]
 
 Markets
Stocks had moderate gains, led by smaller issues. The Nasdaq index set its second straight record, advancing 2.84, to 671.85. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.26 points, to 3,321.10. [D4.]
Bonds have had a record-breaking year. Sales of corporate issues, for example, nearly matched the combined total of 1990 and 1991. [D11.]
The dollar was mixed in very quiet trading, with most traders already on the holiday sidelines. Gold rose. [D12.]
Hog futures contracts settled mixed, as the Government said the expansion in pork production would slow. Oil prices edged lower. [D12.]
 
 Today's Columns
All too often in 1992, agencies chose to derive, not create. All the more reason to applaud the year's innovative, even risky, output. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D1.]
The mutual fund industry is ending its best year ever with a buoyant December, and one poll of fund investors shows more buying interest now than at any time in the past three years. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D1.]

1992: The Year Mundane Became Commonplace

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
All too often during 1992, advertising agencies chose derivativity over creativity, producing work that shamelessly recycled the tried-and-true, like celebrity endorsements, uplifting jingles or special effects.
A Burger King campaign by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, for example, borrows a personality from MTV, Dan Cortese, and a theme from Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein, turning the latter's slogan for National Basketball Association commercials ("I love this game!") into "I love this place!" In Pizza Hut spots introduced last week by BBDO New York, the theme, "Sometimes you gotta stop and smell the pizza," echoes that agency's Pepsi-Cola slogan, while the soundtrack features the rock song "Louie, Louie," which has not been heard in a commercial since, oh, let's see, a week ago Tuesday.
 
Rare Examples of Innovation
 So applaud those all-too-few instances when agencies stretched and produced fresh, innovative, even risky, output. Like the campaign from Cotton Inc., in which America's cotton growers infused their heretofore relentlessly upbeat image campaign, with serious, even tough, vignettes, like a woman banging on the door of a closed savings and loan, or a gang member's funeral. If cotton is "the fabric of our lives," as the ads proclaim, it makes sense to present all aspects of life. Agency: Ogilvy & Mather New York. 
 How much stronger that seemed than the Reebok campaign, which well into the summer months , at a cost of $30 million, asked which of two American decathletes, Dan O'Brien or Dave Johnson, would win the gold medal at the Summer Olympics and thereby be certified as "the world's greatest athlete." The monstrous conceit that winning the decathlon would, ipso facto, decide that issue was the campaign's downfall, as both men lost. Had the advertisements simply, and less self-importantly, set up a friendly rivalry between the photogenic pair, Reebok would have left Barcelona golden rather than red-faced. Agency: Chiat/Day.
Following is a review of other high and low points in creativity, in alphabetical order:
 
Highs
 CHRYSLER: Lee A. Iacocca's swan song -- his 61st, and final, television commercial for the Chrysler Corporation, coinciding with his retirement as chairman -- was music to motorists' ears. "I have to tell you," he concluded in the smoothly confident spot, for Chrysler's new LH line of family sedans, "when it's your last turn at bat, it sure is nice to hit a home run." Indeed. Agency: Bozell Inc.
 BILL CLINTON: Though none of Mr. Clinton's campaign commercials are likely to be voted into a Political Advertising Hall of Fame, they did bolster his bid for the White House -- a novelty for a Democratic Presidential contender. Agency: Clinton/Gore Creative Team.
THE GAP: Print ads and store posters for the retailer, featuring the cast of the Fox series "Melrose Place," seemed no different from other television tie-in campaigns. Yet they were a first. One character -- Matt the social worker, portrayed by the actor Doug Savant -- is gay. The Gap's small step was emblematic of a series of similar decisions during the year by mainstream advertisers like CBS, the Netherlands Board of Tourism and Philip Morris. Agency: In-house.
CALVIN KLEIN: The young rap singer Marky Mark somehow projected a childlike innocence in commercials, print ads and posters for Calvin Klein's underwear and jeans, despite a penchant for constantly undressing. His vitality and insouciance accomplished everything that Mr. Klein utterly failed to achieve last year with his pretentious ad supplement that passed off smug models as rock stars. Agency: In-house.
LEE JEANS: Though tight pants are usually no laughing matter, commercials for Lee Easy Riders jeans used humor to dramatize the pitfalls of clothes that cut off circulation. In one spot, a man singing as he dressed after a shower suddenly changed from a baritone to a soprano. In another, a family cringed as pop's pants button popped off and ricocheted around a room. Agency: Fallon McElligott.
NIKE: Another outstanding year for a marketer that managed to turn the reek of sweat into the sweet smell of success. Highlights included a fast-paced commercial in which the comedian Denis Leary tackled the unlikely subject of Bo Jackson's hip injury; a spot combining live action and animation, enabling Michael Jordan to team with Bugs Bunny, and emotional magazine ads aimed at women that were remarkably free of cant and stereotypes. Agency: Wieden & Kennedy.
ROSS PEROT: He's no adman of the year, as Advertising Age declared. Nevertheless, a series of program-length commercials for the independent candidate somehow managed to overcome the limitations of the form and make trenchant points about the nation's economic woes. Agency: The 270 Group.

 
 
Lows
 GEORGE BUSH: Talk about derivative. The advertising for the President's re-election campaign slavishly copied commercials that helped Britain's Conservative Party cling to power earlier this year and flung mud, 1988-style, at Bill Clinton's character. Not even Mr. Bush can pardon his ad team. Agency: The November Company.
COCA-COLA: During the Summer Olympics, Coca-Cola concocted an international advertising festival, carrying the theme "Shared around the world." It enabled Americans to watch excerpts of Coke commercials from countries like Brazil and Japan. The global glimpse only served to remind viewers how pedestrian and prosaic Coke's domestic ads have been. Agency: McCann-Erickson.
DREAM TEAM: The drubbing that other nations' basketball teams suffered at the hands of the Americans paled in comparison to the overkill American consumers were forced to endure. By reveling in the team's lopsided victories, blatant jingoism and crass commercialism, marketers like Kellogg, McDonald's and Nike obliterated the spirit of good will the Olympics ostensibly celebrates. Agencies: Various.
MCI COMMUNICATIONS: One campaign likened the choice of a long-distance carrier to the importance of the first 100 days of a Presidential administration. Another, one of the most embarrassingly bathetic of the year, tried to invoke pity for the husband and child of an American athlete because she left them to compete as a race walker in the Summer Olympics. Someone ought to tell MCI's top executives that overdramatic, bombastic advertising rings no bells. Agency: Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer Euro RSCG.
MILLER LITE: Like some teen-ager who takes a year off from school to travel around Europe, Lite struggled to find itself. The result was a series of stilted, mawkish commercials, replete with aliens, dogs and special effects, that seemed more appropriate for an also-ran brewed somewhere in lower Upper Michigan than for the Miller Brewing Company's flagship brand and the nation's best-selling light beer. At least "It's it and that's that," one of the least expressive slogans in advertising history, was dumped, though its successor, "I like it like that," is not much more likable. Agency: Leo Burnett U.S.A.
PEPSI-COLA: To "Gotta have it," the soft drink's amorphously unfocused new slogan, the only sane response must be "Sorry, don't gotta." Agency: BBDO New York.
WNBC-TV: A campaign to promote the station was built around a saccharine self-congratulatory commercial, offering New Yorkers a prettified fantasy version of their city so false that it made "On the Town" look like "Cruising." The paean's pathos was compounded by its length, a mind-deadening three and a half minutes. As a real New Yorker might say, Oy. Agency: In-house.

HEADLINE: Amtrak Sued Over Barring Of Billboard

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
In a legal battle pitting freedom of expression against the refusal of a government-subsidized agency to accept political advertising, a Manhattan artist says Amtrak has barred him from turning a gigantic billboard at the entrance to Pennsylvania Station into a political critique. The artist, Michael A. Lebron, is suing the agency, seeking to force Amtrak to display the piece.
Mr. Lebron, whose acerbic work has hung in subway stations in New York and Washington, says he leased the Penn Station Spectacular, a curved billboard measuring 103 feet by 10 feet that is seen by thousands of people each day as they descend the escalators into the midtown station in Manhattan. 
 On the billboard, the 38-year-old artist planned to mount a photo montage with written texts attacking the Coors family, owners of the Coors Brewing Company, over financial support of right-wing political causes.
Mr. Lebron said the work "can be viewed as an allegory about the abuse of economic power."
 
'Money and Power'
 "This isn't about Coors," he asserted. "It's about the law and money and power in America."
Mr. Lebron said that on Tuesday, just three days before the work was to be installed, Amtrak, which owns Pennsylvania Station, informed him that it had a policy prohibiting political advertising on the Spectacular.
This afternoon, lawyers for Mr. Lebron, who is being represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights and the firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, will ask Judge Michael B. Mukasey in Federal District Court in Manhattan for a restraining order that would force Amtrak to allow the work to be displayed.
David Cole of the Center for Constitutional Rights said Amtrak, as a quasi-governmental entity, did not have the freedom that newspapers and magazines have to reject political advertising. The railroad corporation was created by the Federal Government and receives Federal subsidies, and most of the members of its governing board are appointed by the President.
"Amtrak cannot give preference to commercial speech over political speech," Mr. Cole said. "They broke his contract and they violated his First Amendment rights."
Pat Kelly, a spokeswoman for Amtrak in Washington, said, "Once a matter is in litigation, Amtrak cannot comment."
She added that she did not know whether there was a particular policy regarding the material permitted for the Penn Station Spectacular.
 
Similar Suits
 Mr. Lebron has had success in similar suits he has brought in similar circumstances. In 1984, he sued the Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority for refusing to allow him to hang posters in Washington subway stations that showed President Ronald Reagan and his aides at a banquet table, mocking others who were not invited to dine.
A Federal District Court judge decided against the artist, but a three-judge appeals panel later ruled in his favor and the works were installed in the Washington stations. The appellate panel included Antonin Scalia, who was later appointed to the United States Supreme Court, Robert H. Bork, who was nominated to the Supreme Court but rejected by the Senate, and Kenneth W. Starr, now the Justice Department's Solicitor General.
In 1982, Mr. Lebron tried to lease advertising space in several New York subway stations, but his posters -- including the one he later showed in the Washington subways -- were rebuffed because of their political content. After the artist sued, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority relented, saying the dispute had been a misunderstanding, and the suit was dropped.
"It's not like I go about trying to do this kind of lawsuit," Mr. Lebron said. "I just want to put my artwork up in a public place."
 
A Visual Parody
 This time, the work in question is, in part, a visual parody of a typical beer commercial and poses the question, "Is it the right's beer now?" a play on the Coors Light slogan, "It's the right beer now."
The text cites Coors family members' support for the Nicaraguan contras and such conservative groups as the Heritage Foundation. It also refers to other issues over which the family and the company have been criticized, saying, "When you buy Coors products, you help them turn back civil rights, censure high school textbooks, weaken labor laws and environmental protections, promote homophobia, and meddle in foreign affairs."
Members of the Coors family could not be reached for comment on the situation yesterday. David Dunnewald, a spokesman for the Coors Brewing Company, said, "We don't take a position on issues of this nature," adding that he could not speak for family members.
Mr. Lebron said he began negotiating last spring with Transportation Displays Inc. of Manhattan, which acts as Amtrak's leasing agent for Pennsylvania Station advertising and which is also named as a defendant in the suit.
He informed the company that the work would be political, he said, "and they said unless it was sexually obscene or showed physical violence, they saw no reason why it would be a problem."
 
Reduced-Size Version
 Both the artist and Transportation Displays signed a contract for him to lease the space for January and February, for $37,000. The lawsuit says that he first showed Transportation Displays a reduced-size version of his work on Dec. 2, after the contract was signed, and that the company forwarded it to Amtrak for final approval.
Mr. Lebron contends that he tried and failed repeatedly during December to elicit an answer from Amtrak. On Dec. 23, he said, an Amtrak official told him that the agency did not have a policy regarding political advertising.

Banner '92 Ends in Burst of Investment in Stocks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The mutual fund industry is ending its best year ever with a buoyant December, fund executives said yesterday, and one poll of fund buyers shows more buying interest now than at any time in the last three years.
The reports of strong sales in December, in stock mutual funds and particularly in sales of municipal bond funds, came as the Investment Company Institute reported that sales of stock funds set a record in November, with $9.9 billion pouring into such funds. 
 That figure exceeded the previous record, which was set in April, by $2.4 billion, or 32 percent, and reflected a huge flow of cash into the most aggressive stock funds, which invest primarily in small stocks. Those stocks have been rising rapidly lately, a fact reflected yesterday when the Nasdaq composite rose again, to a record.
The latest surge into stock funds began at about the time of the Presidential election. "Things were very quiet prior to the election, and then it just turned right around," said Don Webber, president of State Street Research and Management, a mutual fund sponsor. "It seemed that the consumer had more confidence."
While Mr. Webber said stock fund sales rose even further in December, some other fund groups reported the pace slackened a bit, although it remained very strong. "For us, November was a record month and December will be the second-strongest month ever," said Michael Hines, a vice president of Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund company.
A survey of mutual fund investors, undertaken for Fidelity by the University of Michigan, found that 56 percent of owners said they planned to buy more stock funds within the next three months. That was up from 45 percent in November and was the highest ever in the three years the survey has been taken.
Through the first 11 months of 1992, investors poured a net $68.7 billion into stock funds, 79 percent more than in all of 1991, when the previous annual record of $38.4 billion was set.
 
Talk of Tax Increases
 Talk of tax increases in Washington -- and the reality of them in many states -- served to push net sales of municipal bond funds to $3.7 billion, the highest monthly level in nearly six years. "The kind of people who were investing in money market funds a year ago are now putting their money into intermediate-maturity tax-exempts," said Diane M. Coffee, a spokeswoman for Dreyfus.
But while municipal bonds have continued to draw in cash, some other types of bond funds are less popular than they were, reflecting the fact some interest rates rose in early November, causing losses for bondholders. Funds that invest in government bonds took in a net $258 million in November, the lowest figure for any month since June 1991.
Overall, bond funds took in $7.8 billion in November, raising the 1992 total to $88.4 billion. That is nearly a third more than the $67.2 billion that flowed into such funds in all of 1991, but it appears that the final 1992 figure will still fall short of the record $108.6 billion set in 1986.
The figure for all long-term funds, including both stock and bond funds but excluding money-market funds, is $157 billion for the first 11 months, well above the record for an entire year of $130.5 billion, set in 1986.
The figures for cash flow include new sales and redemptions of funds, and net transfers between various mutual funds. But they exclude reinvested dividends.
 
A Difficult Task
 The rush of money into stock funds left fund managers with the difficult task of finding ways to spend all that money. They tried, but their net monthly purchases of $5.7 billion in stocks still left stock funds with a record $42.9 billion in cash at the end of November. That came to 9.4 percent of assets, up only slightly from 9.3 percent a month earlier.
The managers who appeared to have the most difficulty finding stocks to buy were those who run aggressive growth funds, which invest primarily in small stocks. They spent $1.1 billion more to buy stocks than to sell them in the month, but such purchases did not go very far in offsetting the record $2.8 billion that investors poured in. At the end of the month, such funds had $9.6 billion in cash, or 12.2 percent of assets.
The previous record for cash flow into aggressive growth funds was $2.1 billion, set last December.
At the end of November 1991, such funds had total assets of $54.4 billion, a figure that has since risen 45 percent, to $78.8 billion. Of that gain, $13.4 billion has been new cash from investors, with the rest produced by rising prices and reinvested dividends.

HEADLINE: Concern Over Bank Sales of Funds

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
As a barrage of new television commercials proclaims, Wall Street is coming to your local commercial bank branch. At a rapid-fire pace, banks nationwide are stepping up their drive to sell stocks and mutual funds. But as they do, questions are being raised about whether this is in the best interest of the banks or of the customers they serve.
Clearly, mutual fund sales through banks are a trend here to stay. In the last 18 months, as interest rates stayed low, bank customers have been pulling money out of deposit accounts. To keep these customers, banks have provided higher-yielding alternatives like mutual funds. By most tallies, about 10 percent of the $300 billion in mutual funds sold this year will be sold through banks, and the number is expected to grow. 
"Most banks are fast and furiously entering this field, and you will find most have less than one year's experience with it," said Debra McGinty-Poteet, a senior vice president at Bank of America, which has its own $17 billion group of funds. In Detroit, Paul Tobias, senior vice president at Comerica, added: "Our customers have voted with their feet, and they're putting their money in mutual funds. The growth is explosive."
But with growth comes worries. The big concern is that these new customers, often unsophisticated, do not fully understand that these investments are not federally insured and can lose value.
Experts also are concerned that as banks encourage customers to shift deposits into mutual funds, the banks will lack the deposits they need to make loans, particularly as the economy turns around. What's more, bank mutual fund activities are not regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, unlike mutual funds sold through other channels.
One fear, for instance, is that banks might use mutual funds to support their corporate lending activities, stuffing the funds with commercial paper that corporate borrowers issue to pay off troubled bank loans.
"Banks are still in the primitive stage," said Matthew P. Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute, the fund trade group. "My members are very worried. We're not anti-bank. But as an industry, we're worried that if banks mess up on this, it will give us a bad name. A lot of the people buying these mutual funds are less sophisticated, and they have a lemming-like trust in banks."
 
Two Categories
 The Glass-Steagall restrictions, which separate commercial banks from Wall Street's traditional business lines, are loose enough to allow banks legally to sell mutual funds.
The mutual funds banks sell are of two types: The most lucrative are funds owned by the banks themselves, something only larger banks have the resources to do. Today, banks own 1,042 mutual funds, with $265 billion in assets. They include Bank of America's Pacific Horizon funds and Citibank's Landmark funds. When a bank owns a fund, it not only typically collects a one-time sales commission but also earns annual custodial and management fees.
Far more common are sales at banks of nonbank mutual funds like those owned by such big investment families as Fidelity, Kemper and Putnam. No statistics are kept on the billions of dollars in funds sold this way, but these sales represent the bulk of the market. The banks and the funds split the initial sales commissions, and the funds earn the annual management fees.
For mutual funds, banks represent a new distribution channel -- and bank-owned funds, so far, have not cut into their business. For banks, the stakes are higher and more complex.
In addition to providing an alternative for depositors hungry for higher returns, mutual funds provide banks with much appreciated off-balance-sheet revenues. Mutual fund sales are less regulated and less taxed than other bank lines of business and provide a quick lift to a bank's return on assets. And banks do not have to provide reserves against mutual funds, as they do against deposits, or pay into insurance funds that protect depositors against bank failures.
But this activity challenges what banks are all about. It threatens to reduce the amount of lendable deposits, which can contribute to credit shortages. And it replaces the returns that come from turning deposits into loans with less profitable one-time fees from stock sales.
"Banks are being dragged into this by customer demand," said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of Independent Bankers of America, which represents small banks. "Instead of collecting a one-time fee, banks would much prefer to keep the deposits and use them to make a productive loan and earn a spread income. Money in mutual funds is not available for the farmer to buy a new tractor or the homebuilder buying a home. When was the last time you got a car loan from a mutual fund?"
 
Jeopardizing Customer Trust
 The activity also exposes the bank to losing valuable customer trust, which is the basis of banking, if the mutual fund loses money.
To some bankers, these fears are groundless. "Our fear was that we would rob from one pocket to pay another," said Comerica's Mr. Tobias. "But I don't view mutual funds as taking away from deposits and cutting into lending. We feel this might lead to a furtherance of bank deposits, and we're a net winner."
Still, depositors may not fully understand the risks of mutual funds. Many people making these investments are first-time stock buyers and, however warned, may not realize that funds are not insured as are bank deposits.
"These people are not comfortable with financial instruments," said Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services. "To them, most bank buildings almost look religious. It's a feeling of stability. They've gotten to be afraid of brokers, but they'll talk to someone in a bank."
 
The Lincoln S.& L. Case
 These were precisely the kind of people, often elderly, who were hurt in the collapse of Charles H. Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. In that case, when depositors came to buy or roll over Federally insured certificates of deposits from Lincoln, they would be offered the chance to buy higher-yielding bonds issued by the S.& L.'s parent, the American Continental+ Corporation. The bonds collapsed, and investors lost money. In Mr. Keating's subsequent fraud trial, many depositors said they either were not told or did not understand that the bonds were not federally insured.
"I am concerned," said Marianne K. Smythe, director of investment management at the Securities and Exchange Commission. "There is too much danger that the public can mistake you for selling a federally insured product," said Mrs. Smythe, who favors preventing banks from attaching their names to their funds.
Already, the mutual fund industry has been shaken: earlier this year, Fleet/Norstar Bank tried to eliminate an independent board at an in-house mutual fund from Bank of New England, which it had acquired and had planned to liquidate. Independent fund directors are one of the cornerstones of the mutual fund industry, and after negotiations with the S.E.C., the matter was resolved.
Actions like that raise concern that banks might repeat some of the abuses of the 1920's, when their lending and money management activities became intertwined -- or that new abuses might arise. For that reason, the S.E.C. wants to bring them more fully under its scrutiny.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Fell 8.3% in November

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30

 BODY:
New-home sales fell 8.3 percent in November in their second consecutive drop and the worst decline in eight months, the Government said today.
The drop followed a decline that was revised to 8.2 percent in October, which was better than the Government's initial estimate of 10.3 percent. Most economists expect the November sales decline also will turn out to be not as bad as first thought.
 
Rise Had Been Forecast
 The Departments of Commerce and of Housing and Urban Development said sales in November totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 565,000, the lowest in six months and down from a rate of 616,000 in October. 
 Before the report was issued, many analysts were predicting an increase in sales of around 4 percent.
Economists say the department this year has been having difficulty estimating the number of new homes that are "presold" before construction begins and has had to add those sales belatedly to previous months' reports.
The latest drop in new-home sales stands in contrast to a 5.8 percent increase in sales of existing homes in November, to the highest level since 1986. That was reported on Tuesday by the National Association of Realtors.
At the end of November, the seasonally adjusted estimate of new homes for sale was 267,000, representing a 5.9 months' supply at the current sales rate, the biggest supply since May.
Sales for the first 11 months of the year were 19 percent above the corresponding period of 1991.
The median price of a new home in November, meaning half sold for more and half for less, was $128,800, up 4.9 percent from October and 8.7 percent from a year ago.
Regionally, sales dropped 18.5 percent in the South, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 229,000. They fell 9.1 percent in the West, to a rate of 150,000 units. They were unchanged in the Midwest, at 113,000 units, and rose 28 percent in the Northeast, to 73,000 units.

Money Market Funds' Yields Rise on Seasonal Factors

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by tax-exempt and taxable money market funds were higher in the latest week, as seasonal factors continued to exert upward pressures.
In its most recent survey, IBC/ Donoghue's Money Fund Report showed tax-exempt yields sharply higher for the week that ended on Tuesday. Analysts say that by the end of the year, $10 billion to $15 billion of municipal bonds will have been called. In the new year, however, tax-exempt yields are expected to fall back. 
 Assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $657 million, to a total $99.3 billion, as the average number of days left to maturity of securities being held in tax-free fund portfolios dropped to 59, from 61. It is not unusual, the analysts said, for portfolio managers to shorten maturities so they can take advantage of rising yields attributed to year-end factors.
The seven-day average compounded yield for tax-exempt funds rose 38 basis points, to 2.74 percent, while the average seven-day simple yield rose 40 basis points, to 2.73. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. Donoghue's statisticians calculate that over a 30-day period the compounded yield has averaged 2.32 percent and the simple yield 2.3 percent.
Assuming no state taxes, the taxable bond equivalent of the seven-day compounded yield this week for someone in a 28 percent tax bracket is about 3.81 percent, and for those in a 31 percent bracket, about 3.97 percent.
 
Dreyfus Leads Again
 From its survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, IBC/Donoghue's said the Dreyfus Basic Municipal Money Market fund again outperformed the others, to yield 3.62 percent.
For the week ended yesterday, assets of taxable money market funds declined by $11.5 billion, to a total $465.8 billion, with institutional funds down by $9.6 billion and retail funds down $1.9 billion.
Donoghue's analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in taxable money market portfolios fell to 57, from 59, as portfolio managers shortened up to take advantage of year-end high yields.
Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series, distributed by Olde Asset Management Inc. in Detroit, was the top-yielding general-purpose fund with assets of more than $100 million; it yielded 3.79 percent at week's end.
Banks, which compete directly with money market funds for investor money, did little to change yields offered on money-market accounts. According to The Bank Rate Monitor, the average yield remained at 2.76 percent.

HEADLINE: 0.8% Rise In Leading Indicators

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30

 BODY:
The Government's forward-looking economic gauge jumped eight-tenths of 1 percent in November, its second straight advance and the biggest in 10 months, the Commerce Department reported today.
The rise in the Government's index of leading indicators was another in a recent series of upbeat figures, and it confirmed the widely shared belief among analysts that what had been a weak economic expansion has probably become self-sustaining, with various elements reinforcing each other. Last week the recession that began in July 1990 was officially declared to have ended in March 1991. And since last summer, the economy has unmistakably begun to gather steam.
 
'A Higher Plateau'
 "Things clearly have moved to a higher plateau," said Kenneth T. Mayland, chief economist at the Society National Bank in Cleveland. "The early months of 1993 look pretty darn good." 
 The economy's pickup, reflected in a 3.4 percent annual growth rate in the third quarter and more recent gains in retail sales, industrial production, personal incomes, consumer confidence and even jobs have also brought warnings of possible overstimulation by Bill Clinton after he becomes President.
Many believe that Mr. Clinton will not be able to resist pressing some kind of fiscal package, no matter how strong the economy, because inaction would make it harder for him to claim at least partial credit for a "fix."
 
Whose Recovery Is It?
 The string of positive reports is certain to fuel a political debate over who can claim credit for the recovery. President Bush is now seen as correct in declaring during the campaign that the economy was in better shape than most people realized. But Mr. Clinton's victory vastly improved all gauges of consumer confidence, and he might contend that the prospect of his election was what finally gave life to a floundering recovery.
Mr. Clinton, vacationing in Hilton Head, S.C., called news of the rise in the leading index an encouraging sign of national optimism and stressed the need for continued low interest rates to spur economic growth.
"This shows hope and optimism in the country that things are going to get better," Mr. Clinton said, according to a statement. "What we have to do now is keep interest rates down and get growth going."
Some analysts fear a strengthening economy will eventually cause the Federal Reserve to start nudging interest rates higher to head off possible inflation and thereby produce a policy collision with the new Administration.
Politics aside, most economists agree that a rebound has long been under way -- despite an unemployment rate that did not reach its peak of 7.8 percent until this past June -- and that more gains lie ahead.
"We've got a sustained economic expansion on our hands," observed Richard B. Hoey, chief economist for the Dreyfus Corporation. He said this comes "too late for George Bush" but said Mr. Clinton's fortunes would rest with the economy's performance in 1995 and 1996, not whether he can claim credit for 1993.
The increase in the index was accompanied by a hefty November gain in Chicago-area industrial activity and a surprising decline in nationwide sales of new homes.
Analysts tended to dismiss the 8.3 percent tumble in housing, however, since this series has become statistically distorted by changed industry practices and because of a surge in sales of existing homes, reported on Tuesday, that carried them to the highest level in six years.
 
Largest Gain Since January
 The rise in the predictive index, whose gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent was the largest since a surge of 1.1 percent in January, was the second solid gain in a row. October's gain, revised yesterday by the Commerce Department, was five-tenths of 1 percent. From June through September, by contrast, there were small declines in three months out of four.
Moreover, the gain was broadly based and was further supported by increases in two companion indexes of coincident and lagging indicators.
Eight of 11 components of the leading index contributed to the November increase, led by sharply higher consumer expectations as surveyed by the University of Michigan. This jump in expectations accounted for about half the total gain.
The other positive contributors were: an expanded workweek; lower claims for first-time jobless benefits; rising stock prices; a higher proportion of companies reporting slower deliveries from suppliers; a rise in new factory orders for consumer goods; increased unfilled orders for manufactured durables, and an expanded money supply.
The most negative influence was lower prices for materials particularly sensitive to the business cycle, the report showed. The others holding the index back were a drop in building permits and a decline in contracts and orders for plant and equipment.
The index's October gain was revised one-tenth of a point higher, to five-tenths of 1 percent, the report showed, mainly because of later data on factory orders for consumer goods.
The index of coincident indicators, whose movement reflects current conditions, rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent, its second straight increase after declines in August and September.
Lagging indicators, which move after turns in the economy at large, soared 1.3 percent, the biggest gain in more than five years. This index has now advanced three months out of four since a string of 18 straight declines ended in July.
 
Private Indexes Support Rise
 Two privately compiled forecasting indexes also moved up last month. Safian Investment Research said its gauge had climbed 1.1 percent, with 17 of 24 components rising. Herzog, Heine, Geduld's macroeconomic index jumped to a reading of plus 179 from plus 160 in October.
"There's a very good recovery under way now," Norman Robertson of Mellon Bank said. But he cautioned against too much deficit spending by the Clinton Administration. In fact, he added, Mr. Clinton "may have more to gain from a direct attack on the budget deficit than from applying fiscal stimulus."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Old Dragon Waits: The Deficit, Stupid

BYLINE: By Sylvia Nasar

 BODY:
BILL CLINTON has picked his way through the political thicket and is on the verge of reclaiming Camelot. But to retain the loyalty of his subjects over the next four years, he'll have to fight the dragon that has been breathing fire on his predecessors: the $300 billion Federal deficit.
The challenge looks more and more daunting, as Mr. Clinton emphasized at the Little Rock economic teach-in two weeks ago. The Congressional Budget Office has reassessed long-term deficit prospects three times since the last attempt to deal with the monster, the October 1990 budget deal. Each time, the results looked more threatening. 
 The latest estimates, published in August but apparently ignored by Mr. Clinton until recently, set off what Time magazine called the "first political crisis" of the Clinton Presidency by implying that the new Administration would have to find $100 billion more in cuts and tax increases than Mr. Clinton had planned on. That figure is three times what Washington now spends on education and nearly as much as the cost of Medicaid.
Mr. Clinton and his advisers belatedly used the bad news from the budget office at the Little Rock conclave to broach the idea of imposing unpopular gas and benefit taxes, stretching deficit goals out over the entire decade and shielding some new spending programs by tucking them into a so-called capital budget and therefore effectively removing them from deficit calculations.
Back in the winter of 1991, budget analysts were confident that economic recovery and the budget compromise would all but eliminate the deficit in a few years. Last spring, when Mr. Clinton and his team drafted their ambitious economic program, the still-optimistic Congressional Budget Office predicted that a recovering economy and the 1990 budget pact would slash the deficit to less than $160 billion by 1996. This permitted the Clinton campaign to assert that the deficit could be tamed without inflicting much pain on the middle class.
The budget office now sees a deficit of nearly $300 billion in 1997, about the same as last year's and about 4 percent of gross domestic product, but heading higher. That would mean that the deficit would be gobbling up about as much as American households save in a given year.
What's making this monster look so much more threatening now than it did two years ago, a year ago, six months ago?
Three things, the first of which is transitory. Delays in the savings and loan cleanup are pushing spending that would have taken place this year or next into the mid-1990's. The second, no surprise, is the explosive growth of mandatory spending on health benefits as treatments keep getting costlier and more and more older Americans need them.
The third, less obvious, factor is the Congressional agency's expectation that the economy is capable only of very slow growth over the long run, just 2 percent a year. The budget office has been getting gloomier about growth prospects and since the budget deal it has lowered its five-year forecast by about half a percentage point a year.
That has a significant effect on the deficit, because the lower economic growth is, the slower the growth of business profits, investor returns and, most important, workers' wages. Slower growth also tends to make more people eligible for Government handouts.
In the past, the office's long-term forecasts have erred on the side of optimism. But in this case, there is a chance -- not more than a chance -- that the numbers are too bearish. In settling on 2 percent as the economy's growth potential, the office assumes that the work force will grow about 1 percent a year. It also assumes that output per worker will grow just under 1 percent, the same disappointing pace as that of the last 20 years.
There's a possibility -- and that's all it is -- that productivity could grow a lot faster in the long run. Productivity growth has recently been strong, and some economists are starting to wonder whether this is the beginning of a new trend rather than the usual catch-up in the early stages of an expansion to make up for overhiring and sloppy management that crop up at the end of long expansions.
Corporate cutbacks, revampings and heavy spending on new equipment reflect "American industry's effort to prepare itself for global competition ahead," said Stephen Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley. "On the basis of the striking productivity growth in the past year, I'd say we're heading back to a long-term trend of 1.7 percent to 1.8 percent."
If the productivity revival is for real -- and most economists say it is far too soon to tell -- the deficit projections may be too gloomy. A doubling of the long-run productivity growth rate could push long-run G.D.P. growth from 2 to 3 percent a year, lifting annual tax revenues five years hence by roughly $100 billion in the process.
A long-run productivity revival could, in short, make slaying the deficit dragon a lot less politically grueling than otherwise.
If productivity does not come to his aid, Mr. Clinton will either have to find $100 billion worth of spending cuts or tax increases -- beyond those partly questionable ones in his original economic plan -- or like Ronald Reagan and George Bush he will have to ignore the deficit. In a way, back in Little Rock two weeks ago, he seemed to be preparing his supporters for all three possibilities.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Sales Set an Annual Record

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
It has been a record-breaking year in the bond market.
Corporate bond sales reached a high of $301 billion, almost outdoing the last two years combined, according to preliminary totals from the Securities Data Company. For 1991 and 1990 together, the sum of new corporate issues was $307 billion. 
 The record issuance of corporate bonds was fed by the decline in interest rates in response to the Federal Reserve's efforts to revive the sluggish economy.
Another big reason for the bond surge in 1992 was the revival of the high-yield, or junk bond, market, which had fallen on hard times after its fling in the mid-1980's. This year, $38 billion in new junk bonds were issued, compared with just $10 billion in 1991 and even ahead of the previous record of $31 billion in 1986.
 
Junk Bonds More Attractive
 Low interest rates have made the higher-yielding junk bonds more attractive to investors willing to take more risk. And with the economy beginning to recover, the financial health of some companies issuing junk bonds ought to improve, analysts argue, which would make some of the high-yielding securities a little less risky.
There was also a record set for asset-backed securities, which are bonds whose principal and interest are paid for with dedicated sources of revenue, like the payments on automobile loans or credit cards. They have become a popular way for companies and banks to borrow at a time when their low credit ratings would make the issuance of regular bonds too expensive or impossible.
With a flurry of sales in the fourth quarter, the total of new asset-backed securities reached $50.7 billion for the year, just enough to inch past last year's record of $50.1 billion.
Separately, the sale of mortgage-backed securities jumped sharply, rising to a record $373 billion this year from the previous record, $250 billion, reached last year. This was driven by the drop in longer-term interest rates that led many homeowners to refinance their mortgages.
In the municipal market, estimates from the Public Securities Association had already named 1992 the record year for new issues, with a total of $233 billion. Goldman, Sachs & Company and Merrill Lynch competed for the top underwriting position in municipals.
By one calculation, based on being lead manager for a new issue, Goldman, Sachs took top honors. But Merrill Lynch was first in the Securities Data Company tallies when the value of a new issue was shared among the lead underwriter and the other firms involved. Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs were also first and second in the underwriting of corporate issues.
 
New York City
 The City of New York is working out the details of a proposal to sell between $100 million and $150 million of city bonds, denominated in yen, in the Japanese market.
Such a sale to foreigners in a foreign currency would be a first for the city and a sign of the growing innovation in the municipal market as states and local governments seek to lower their costs of borrowing.
If the saving to the city appears adequate, the sale will come as part of the city's next regular financing in February or March, Darcy Bradbury, the deputy comptroller for debt management, said.
Both she and the City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, will go to Tokyo in mid-January to meet with potential buyers of the bonds.
The bonds, which would be taxable, could be quite attractive to Japanese investors. The 10-year bond in Japan now has a yield of 4.5 percent. The interest rate on the 15-year taxable bonds the city sold in October was 9.15 percent.
Ms. Bradbury said that taxable bonds issued by the city had not attracted strong demand domestically but that foreign investors seemed more willing to consider taxable municipal bonds.
 
Treasury Market
 The price of the Treasury bond dropped yesterday, but the prices of Treasury notes rose and the discount rates on Treasury bills declined sharply.
Trading was very light ahead of the half-day New Year's Eve session scheduled for today.
Treasury bill discount rates declined once it appeared that there would be no serious spike in interest rates as companies borrowed to adjust their books over the four nights of the long weekend. The relief helped bring down the discount rate on the three-month Treasury bill to 3.05 percent, a decline of 12 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
The price of the 30-year bond, in secondary trading, fell 7/32 , to 102, for a yield of 7.37 percent, up from 7.36 percent the day before. But the prices of Treasury notes were up from 2/32 to 5/32 ; the yield on the five-year note dropped to 5.98 percent, from 6.02 percent Tuesday.
The economic reports of the day gave mixed signals. The Government's index of leading economic indicators rose eight-tenths of a percent in November. But new-home sales dropped 8.3 percent last month.

Dollar Mixed and Gold Up With Few Traders at Work

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday in very quiet trading, with most traders already sidelined for the New Year's holiday.
Gold prices rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery closed at $332.80 an ounce, up 30 cents. At Republic National Bank of New York, gold was later quoted at $333.25, up 45 cents. 
 The market showed no reaction to a jump of eight-tenths of 1 percent in the Government's Index of Leading Economic Indicators in November. The jump, while the largest in 10 months, was not surprising to economists.
The market also did not react to a report that new-home sales fell 8.3 percent last month, the biggest drop in eight months. Andrew Hodge, vice president for corporate treasury services at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York, said the number was suspect because it was often revised and because it did not square with a Tuesday report of a 5.8 percent rise in November in existing-home sales.
Traders said they expected the dollar to rise after the first of the year, as President-elect Bill Clinton's economic policies took form. Also, they are optimistic for a revised European Monetary System treaty and for a drop in German interest rates, both of which should push the dollar higher.
 
Dollar at 124.50 Yen in Tokyo
 In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.50 yen, down 0.07 from Tuesday's close. In Europe it was quoted higher late yesterday at 124.55 yen. In New York, $1 bought 124.60 yen by late afternoon, down from 124.73 late Tuesday.
In Britain, the pound traded at $1.5125, up from $1.5090 on Tuesday. In New York, 1 cost $1.5100, up from $1.5095 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.6180 German marks, up from 1.61425; 1.4655 Swiss francs, up from 1.4635; 5.5155 French francs, up from 5.4955; 1,474.50 Italian lire, up from 1,469.50; and 1.26875 Canadian dollars, up from 1.26625.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday's late rates included: 1.6140 German marks, down from 1.6165; 1.4590 Swiss francs, down from 1.4645; 5.5045 French francs, down from 5.5060; 1.8130 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8155; 1,472.00 Italian lire, up from 1,469.50, and 1.2685 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2662.
Gold traded in London at a bid price of $333.35 an ounce, up from $332.40 on Tuesday. In Zurich, the bid price was $333.00, up from $332.45. In Hong Kong, gold was down 98 cents, to close at $332.79.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Price of Hogs Holds Steady As Rising Supply Is Seen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Pork producers plan to continue expanding their output in the new year, the Government reported yesterday, but the rate of growth may be slowing.
The quarterly Agriculture Department report showed the United States hog herd was 4 percent larger on Dec. 1 than on the corresponding date last year. The report held no surprises for the hog futures market, which settled narrowly mixed ahead of the report. 
 Live hogs for February delivery rose 0.05 cent, to 43.60 cents a pound, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
February live cattle ended 0.10 cent lower, at 76.17 cents a pound; January feeder cattle fell 0.08 cent, to 85.97 cents a pound, and February frozen pork bellies rose 0.55 cent, to 37.85 cents a pound.
The Agriculture Department said there were 54.7 million hogs and pigs on United States farms as of Dec. 1, compared with 52.7 million a year earlier. Producers told the agency they expected a 3 percent increase in pig births in the December-February quarter and a 1 percent increase in the March-May quarter.
 
Analysts' Assessments Divided
 Analysts were divided in their assessments of how the report would affect hog prices, which have been relatively high in the fourth quarter because of strong consumer demand for pork.
Crude oil prices edged lower in uneventful trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Light crude for February delivery dropped 5 cents, to $19.59 a barrel; January home heating oil rose 0.11 cent, to 56.90 cents a gallon; January unleaded gasoline fell 0.13 cent, to 53.89 cents a gallon, and February natural gas slipped 0.6 cent, to $1.695 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Lumber for January delivery surged $4.30, to $281.50 for 1,000 board feet, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on new signs of economic recovery and tight lumber supplies. The Government said yesterday that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in November, the biggest rise in 10 months.
Wheat futures rebounded modestly on the Chicago Board of Trade, halting a two-day slide on word of stronger export sales and quality problems with the Australian wheat crop. Oat futures also rose while corn and soybean futures ended mostly lower.

HEADLINE: Arts Presenters Shift From the Serious To the Profitable

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
Gurtman & Murtha Associates, well known in the concert management business for having handled bookings for Vladimir Horowitz, the Stuttgart Ballet and other distinguished artists, has a new client this season: the Amazing Kreskin, a so-called mentalist, or mind reader.
"I never thought I'd be handling Kreskin," said James Murtha, vice president of the firm, who cut his teeth working for the legendary impresario Sol Hurok. "But we don't want to get caught with 400 classical artists signed up and no bookings. We have to listen to what the performing-arts presenters want." 
 What the presenters increasingly want in these days of financial wariness are mass-appeal pop events that attract ticket buyers more readily than do programs of classical or difficult new music, theater and dance. The result is that the performing-arts industry -- agents and directors of presenting institutions who were interviewed at their two annual conventions just before Christmas -- is significantly shifting from serious, challenging or experimental work to popular entertainment.
The two conventions, which drew several hundred participants from around the country to New York City, were held by the International Society of Performing Arts Administrators and the Association of Performing Arts Presenters.
 
No Respect
 Many arts professionals are angry about the situation. "We've become a second-rate cultural nation," said Robert Brustein, artistic director of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. "There's a tremendous amount of talent available, but serious work doesn't have the respect or endorsement it used to have."
He pointed to the Old Globe Theater in San Diego and the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco as examples of regional nonprofit theaters that are increasingly steering clear of challenging work in favor of polished frippery.
Harold Shaw, president of Shaw Concerts, is so indignant over the lack of public interest in the recital of classical music that he is terminating the annual $20,000 award he has been giving to the most imaginative presenter of a recital. "Last year we had only four applications, and this year two," he said.
Small presenters who don't have the financial backing of a wealthy institution or board of trustees are particularly vulnerable to the trend. Jack Globenfelt, managing director of the Lehman Center for the Performing Arts at Herbert H. Lehman College in the Bronx, said that not only has he reduced his entire programming by 60 percent in the last two years but also has "drastically curtailed" offerings of classical music and ballet, replacing them with hip-hop performers and Danny Rivera, a popular Puerto Rican crooner.
"We have to take cognizance of the impact of the recession and changing demographics in the major cities," Mr. Globenfelt said.
 
'Figaro to Fiddler'
 Robert Merrill, the former Metropolitan Opera baritone, is one of many classically trained musicians who has lately turned to pops. Mr. Merrill, who sang with the Metropolitan Opera for 32 years, is soon to embark on a solo tour billed as "Figaro to Fiddler," in which he mixes a few operatic chestnuts with the show tunes of Irving Berlin, George Gershwin and Andrew Lloyd Webber.
Even many highbrow organizations seem captives of the trend. Sheldon Soffer Management, a concert agency that has long specialized in handling such dance companies as Pilobolus, the Mark Morris Dance Group and Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, is now booking Circus Flora, a traveling company.
Some performing-arts presenters who refused to adapt to the new pressures have recently gone out of business. The Sacramento Symphony filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 10, and the San Diego Foundation for Performing Arts, which specialized in dance, collapsed on Nov. 2 and has yet to make refunds to subscribers.
"People will still pay to see Pavarotti and the Bolshoi Ballet," said Fred Colby, the former executive director of the San Diego Foundation for Performing Arts, "but last October we could sell only 44 percent of our capacity for the Lyons Opera Ballet. We knew that was the end."
 
Entire Season Canceled
 In New York, last season's heavily classical Colden Center Performances series at Queens College was one of the more disruptive casualties when the budget for the City University was cut. The season was canceled and a number of contracts had to be broken.
Some arts professionals say the current situation results from a failure of education as well as from the recession.
Betty Allen, president and former executive director of the Harlem School of the Arts, recalled that a teen-ager recently showed up at an audition for the school's Concert Chorale, a 35-member chorus, and began rapping rather than singing.
"He didn't know the difference between singing and talking," Ms. Allen said. "That's a direct result of the fact that in 1977 New York City eliminated music teachers from elementary schools and all but a few in the upper schools and specialized schools."
Mr. Shaw agreed. "You erase the arts from the schools as we did during the Reagan years," he said, "and young people no longer have that empathic participation in them. We are living in a period of neglect."
"But it goes deeper than that," Mr. Shaw continued. "When a man tosses a baseball back and forth with his son, he is developing someone who may or may not play baseball professionally but who will certainly be a very good audience for the sport. The same works in classical music. Without that early exposure, you don't get the empathic response that it takes to make you want to be in the audience."
David Levenson, managing director of the Brooklyn Center for Performing Arts at Brooklyn College, took a more philosophical view of the situation. "The arts market is righting itself, as they say on Wall Street," he said. "We're going to find out if this country really needs 1,500 orchestras and hundreds of regional theaters. Maybe Atlanta simply can't afford $18 million every year for its symphony orchestra."
Many agents and presenters are stoutly -- and successfully -- resisting the trend. Marvin Shofer, an artists' representative at the Schofer/ Gold/Lobrano agency, said that in contrast to the blase attitude he encountered when he worked for the Boston Symphony in the late 1960's, "major orchestras are selling themselves today with as much glitz as an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, promoting themselves with coffee mugs, umbrellas, tote bags and Mylar posters."
Herman L. Jones, associate producer of the National Black Touring Circuit, which produces black dance, theater and music attractions, said that although business is off by 20 percent his organization has been able to hold its own by relating to current social trends.
One of the group's most popular shows, called "Great Women of Color," he said, deals with the lives and music of little-known black women who played jazz. "We never used to do jazz, and of course the women's thing is new," Mr. Jones said, "but the public likes it."
 
New Audience
 Jon Aaron, president of the Boston-based Aaron Concert Management, said that after he arranged for a local Haitian choir to sing music of the early Spanish colonies at a Columbus-quincentennial program at the Tanglewood Music Festival, he publicized the event in the Haitian community in Dorchester, Mass., and attracted a Haitian audience to Tanglewood, probably for the first time.
Mr. Aaron, who primarily handles classical musicians, said he had to be equally creative in fee negotiations. "If I have an artist I think will do well and the presenter is hesitant, I say: 'I'll take a certain figure plus 60 percent of the box office.' I never used to say that."
Perhaps most enterprising of all, Ronald Pearson, director of the Koger Center for the Arts at the University of South Carolina at Columbia, helped to convince the university's trustees to place 60 percent of the profits of rock concerts at the university's football stadium in an endowment, using the interest to support serious programming at the Koger.
"We worked really hard to make the argument that since income from the major sports is used to help support the minor sports like track and cross-country, we should be able to use rock concerts to support serious music, theater and dance," Mr. Pearson said. "It took two years, but it worked."

HEADLINE: SKIING;
Collegians Get a Break On the Slopes in January

BYLINE: By JANET NELSON

 BODY:
There is no better time to be a college student who skis than the first few weeks in January, when ski areas throughout the East offer discounted lift tickets, low-priced ski weeks and an abundance of activities aimed at the college crowd. All you need to participate is a valid college identification card and time off from studies on weekdays, Jan. 4-8, 11-15 and 18-22.
January is usually a slow month, so ski areas organize special events for skiers and this year, according to marketing executives, more ski areas are offering price breaks to college students. 
 "During the last two years, sales to students went down," said Larry Benus, vice president of Student Excursions (800) 925-8500, (212) 679-7699), a New York City tour operator that sells student packages. "This year, business is already up about 25 percent over last year. It's because of the cold weather and that the economy is looking up."
Student Excursions sells five nights' lodging and six days of skiing for from $229 to $259 at Smugglers' Notch, Stratton and Sugarbush, Vt., and Whiteface, N.Y. Prices are based on double occupancy in hotels or filling condominiums to capacity, but comparable accommodations might cost $400 or more to noncollege skiers.
 
Special Packaging
 Killington, Vt., has been holding Collegiate Ski Fests for 12 years and typically has about 500 students each week for the three midweek periods in January. Lodges in the region offer packages that start at $200 per person for five days of skiing and five nights lodging. For five days of skiing, lift tickets cost $140, which is $28 off the regular price, and on a daily basis, students can buy an extra credit card for $25 and ski all season from Sunday through Friday, nonholidays, for $25 versus the regular ticket price of $41.
From Jan. 4-8, Stowe, Vt., holds a College Week with a five-day lift ticket for $135, which is $30 off the regular ticket. For low-priced accommodations, the Round Hearth dorm offers five nights with meals for $110 and the Vermont State Ski Dorm has bunk rooms for $29.70 a night with two meals.
Sunday River, Me., holds Gotta Rock ski weeks for college students during the first two midweek periods in January. Lift tickets are $25 compared to the regular price of $36 and dorm accommodations are $22 a night.
 
Colleges All Around
 Gore Mountain, N.Y., situated within a maximum three-hour drive of more than 25 colleges, cuts the price of midweek lift tickets to $20, $4 off the regular weekday price for the first two weeks in January. Whiteface Mountain will sell five-day tickets for $75, a $44 discount off the regular midweek price. Both areas offer college and high school students seasonlong discounts when they purchase a student card for $35. With this card, they can ski midweek for $17 and weekends for $20.
Some ski areas also offer season-long deals to college students during midweek, nonholiday periods. In Vermont, Okemo sells tickets at half price for $19.50 and Mount Snow's price is $25, $12 off the regular rate. Attitash, N.H., reduces ticket prices to $23 and Jiminy Peak, Mass., takes $10 off the regular $30 lift ticket price.
The next best time to be a college student who skis is during spring break, when ski areas repeat many of these deals and, sometimes, offer even bigger discounts.
