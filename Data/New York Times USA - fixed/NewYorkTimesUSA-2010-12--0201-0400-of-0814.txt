HEADLINE: U.S. Selling Last of Stake In Citigroup

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
8:30 p.m. Updated
Citigroup is finally wriggling free of Uncle Sam.
Two years after the financial giant was bailed out by the federal government, the United States Treasury is selling its remaining shares in the company.
The move, announced late Monday, largely ends the remarkable federal rescue of Citigroup, whose downfall came to symbolize all that was wrong with Wall Street. It also represents another milestone in the postbailout era.
While the government would retain a vestigial interest in Citigroup after the offering, the sale would effectively free the giant company from modest federal pay restrictions and lift a cloud that has hung over its chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit. ''We are very appreciative of the support provided by the U.S.T. during the financial crisis,'' the company said in a statement, referring to the United States Treasury. 
Emboldened by strong investor interest and recent initial public offering of General Motors, another bailed-out giant, the Treasury announced Monday evening that it would start selling 2.4 billion shares of Citigroup common stock. The deal was expected to be priced at $4.35 a share, a 2 percent discount, according to a person briefed on the transaction who asked for anonymity because the deal had not yet closed. All told, that means that taxpayers will reap about a $12 billion profit on the Treasury's multibillion-dollar investment in Citigroup.
While the final accounting of the government broader bailouts will not be known for years, major banks and the Detroit automakers have emerged from the rescues far faster than many had expected. The government remains deeply entangled in the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but officials are mapping out plans to wind down the investment in the American International Group, possibly through a stock offering early next year.
Proceeds from the Citigroup sale would be the single biggest profit yet from the government bailout programs. Few saw such a quick windfall two years ago. Many doubted the wisdom of using taxpayers' money to rescue Citigroup, which was devastated when the home mortgage market imploded. Citigroup was the biggest user of several of emergency support programs that the Federal Reserve put in place during the crisis.
But federal officials, worried that the failure of Citigroup might cascade through the financial system, ended up injecting $45 billion into the company in the autumn of 2008, and creating an enormous insurance policy covering potential losses on more than $301 billion of real estate assets.
In return, the government assumed ownership of nearly a third of Citigroup. It also secured a small piece of potential profits through securities known as warrants.
After several big banks repaid their bailout funds, Citigroup officials began pressing the Treasury to allow their company to do the same. Last December, Citigroup was allowed to return $20 billion of its bailout funds, and the government announced plans to unwind its remaining $25 billion common stock investment.
A bungled stock sale forced the Treasury Department to delay its initial offering for Citigroup until April, when the government began to sell its nearly 7.7 billion shares. Through October, the government had sold about 5.3 billion shares to private investors, at an average price of just over $4 apiece. With dividends and other payments, that meant the government had fully recouped its initial $45 billion investment.
As interest in the Citigroup shares picked up, Treasury officials began plotting a larger stock offering for several months but kept bank officials in the dark about their plans. On Monday morning, the Treasury informed Citigroup that it planned to sell the remaining 2.4 billion shares all at once. Morgan Stanley, which had handled the previous stock sales, is leading the offering.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Tax Cut Endgame

 BODY:
President Obama's deal with the Republicans to extend all the Bush-era income tax cuts is a win for the Republicans and their strategy of obstructionism and a disappointing retreat by the White House.
We suppose it could have been worse. The deal could help to stimulate the weak economy. And if the Republicans had blocked an extension of unemployment benefits, as they were threatening to, millions of Americans would have suffered greatly.
But the country can't afford to continue tax cuts for the rich indefinitely. And by kicking the issue down the road to 2012 -- a presidential election year -- it all but guarantees more craven politicking then. 
Speaking on Monday evening, the president said that the deal would extend for two years all of the tax cuts, both those from the Bush years and those for low-income workers from last year's stimulus law. Recently expired benefits for the long-term unemployed would also be extended for another 13 months.
In addition, the agreement includes a one-year cut in payroll taxes that will put a relatively modest, but much needed, $120 billion in workers' pockets, and a year of bolstered write-offs for business investments.
On a decidedly sour note, Mr. Obama also said he had agreed to cut estate taxes even more than in the last year of the Bush administration. That is not compromise. It is capitulation.
The Republicans gave up very little except for their unconscionable stance of holding up all other Congressional action until they ensured that the richest Americans keep their tax cuts.
The tax cuts were not affordable when they were passed and are even less affordable now -- with unpaid-for wars, with a weak economy crying out for recovery efforts, with the nation's infrastructure and education system increasingly decrepit, and with retiring baby boomers inexorably driving up health costs and the budget deficit in the decades to come.
A thoughtful approach -- not broached by either side -- would have been to extend the tax cuts for most Americans for another year or so, letting the high-end tax breaks expire as scheduled this year and using the money to help pay for policies that would do more than income tax cuts to generate growth. In the meantime, lawmakers and the administration could have undertaken tax reform to bring revenues in line with spending.
Mr. Obama and the country should not wait for two years to begin reforming taxes.
Until Monday night, both sides were silent on the fate of one of the biggest high-end tax cuts of all -- the estate tax on multimillionaires and billionaires. Now Mr. Obama seems to have given in to largely Republican demands on it.
Perhaps he wanted to placate the main proponent of gutting the estate tax further, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, who has also been working to block a vote on the New Start arms control treaty. Yes, the Republicans were also holding the nation's security hostage to their relentless drive for tax cuts for the wealthy.
All of this only validates the Republican strategy of obstruction, and invites more. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, has never wavered in his stance that all Bush tax cuts should be extended. Mr. McConnell and the Republicans will undoubtedly now push to make the cuts permanent.
Mr. Obama said on Monday night that he still believed extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy was a bad idea. He predicted that it would be undone in two years when it becomes apparent to everyone that the country can't afford it. The president needs to ask himself why he couldn't make that case now -- and how he plans to change his approach to governing so he doesn't get trapped this way again.
Mr. Obama also said that ''we cannot play politics at a time when the American people are looking for us to solve problems.'' Unfortunately, the Republicans felt no such compunction. He should have fought harder.

HEADLINE: A Big Idea

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN. 
Timothy Egan is a columnist for nytimes.com.

 BODY:
Grow a spine. Flex some muscle. Man up!
In Twitter-speak, the advice to President Obama from his disheartened liberal base is to bulk up on the political equivalent of steroids, something to make this most cerebral of presidents more ripped and less reserved. They want ''Bring It On, the Sequel'': let Republicans deny unemployment benefits for two million people at Christmastime while giving Mr. Potter and his ilk another tax break.
Then the president can get rid of ''don't ask, don't tell'' by executive order, just as Harry Truman integrated the armed forces. He can dare Republicans to dismantle a new health care law that prevents insurance companies from dropping people when they get sick. He can insist that the fledgling consumer protection bureau, the only bulwark in the federal government against predatory lenders and credit card carnivores, be fully funded and staffed. 
Not. Gonna. Happen. One of the most revealing film clips from Obama's past shows him at school when he became the first black president of a fractious Harvard Law Review. Young Obama, the college-age compromiser, looks eerily like middle-age Obama trying to be bipartisan at midterm. And there he was on Monday, giving in to tax cuts for all in return for a few favors for the middle class.
But if he can't change his personal nature, he can change the master narrative of his presidency. To do that, he needs a Big Idea. One of the mystifying paradoxes of Obama is how this gifted writer, this eloquent communicator, has not been able to come up with a simple, overarching governing frame.
For Teddy Roosevelt, fighting monopoly capitalists at a time when the gap between the rich and everyone else was almost as great as it is today, it was the Square Deal - leverage for the little guy. Franklin Roosevelt expanded his cousin's social contract with the New Deal, which carried enough populist punch to help a New York politician with a moneyed accent win the heartland four times.
John F. Kennedy had his New Frontier - pitch-perfect for the strutting Jet Age. And Ronald Reagan countered middle-class anxiety with Morning in America. Bill Clinton found his footing after the Oklahoma City bombings, rallying the country to oppose the forces of hate.
Loser presidents, the single-termers, stand for nothing, but have opinions on everything. Think of Jimmy Carter or George H. W. Bush and only mush comes to mind.
The verdict on Obama is still out. His approval rating is in the mid-40s, not bad for a man who took control during the worst economy since the Depression. Most polls have him higher than Clinton and Reagan at a similar time in office, and higher since the election revealed the heartless, corporate-owned face of his opposition. Truman's party lost 55 seats in the House at midterm. Clinton gave up 54. They were dead men. One-termers. Until they weren't.
Obama's achievements - saving the auto industry, fixing much of the runaway financial sector, passing a health care law that, once fully understood, will be seen as historic - are not insignificant. They are monumental, even.
But presidents do not win their way into voters' hearts with legislative triumphs. Most Americans don't know that they got a one-time tax cut from Obama, or that the bailouts may end up making money for the Treasury. The near-term goals - a free-trade agreement with South Korea, a nuclear arms treaty with Russia - will do nothing to change views. Weekly up and down score sheets are for the political-industrial complex.
A Big Idea, understood by all, would provide a narrative framework for the upcoming skirmishes with Republicans, whose only idea is to keep rich people from paying their fair share of taxes. That, and denying Obama a second term.
What may have lulled Obama into his thoughtful stupor was the historic magnitude of his election. Yet being the first black president is not an idea. Hope is not a theme. Change We Can Believe In is not a governing principle.
The Big Idea does not need to be grandiose. Simple is better. It has to show that Obama is on the side of average Americans, who, in turn, must believe the country is moving in the right direction despite a painful economy.
He hit a few good notes on Monday in his speech to college students in North Carolina. Evoking American motivation to greatness after the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik in 1957, Obama said, ''Our generation's Sputnik moment is next.'' What's needed, he said, is ''to do what Americans have always been known for: building, innovating, making things.''
The words, the sentiment, the right impulses are all there in the White House. It's up to the writer-president to put them together.

HEADLINE: Obama Reaches Accord With G.O.P. on Tax Cut; Democrats Hold Back

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and JACKIE CALMES; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama announced a tentative deal with Congressional Republicans on Monday to extend the Bush-era tax cuts at all income levels for two years as part of a package that would also keep benefits flowing to the long-term unemployed, cut payroll taxes for all workers for a year and take other steps to bolster the economy.
The deal appeared to resolve the first major standoff since the midterm elections between the White House and newly empowered Republicans on Capitol Hill. But it also highlighted the strains Mr. Obama faces in his own party as he navigates between a desire to get things done and a retreat from his own positions and the principles of many liberals.
Congressional Democrats pointedly noted that they had yet to agree to any deal, even as many Republicans signaled that they would go along. 
Mr. Obama said that he did not like some elements of the framework, but that he had agreed to it to avoid having taxes increase for middle class Americans at the end of the year. He said that in return for agreeing to Republican demands that income tax rates not go up on upper-income brackets, he had secured substantial assistance to lower- and middle-income workers as well as the unemployed.
''It's not perfect, but this compromise is an essential step on the road to recovery,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It will stop middle-class taxes from going up. It will spur our private sector to create millions of new jobs, and add momentum that our economy badly needs.''
The package would cost about $900 billion over the next two years, to be financed entirely by adding to the national debt, at a time when both parties are professing a desire to begin addressing long-term fiscal imbalances.
It would reduce the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax on all wage earners by two percentage points for one year, putting more money in the paychecks of workers. For a family earning $50,000 a year, it would amount to a savings of $1,000.
For a worker slated to pay the maximum tax, $6,621.60 on income of $106,800 or more in 2011, the cut would mean a savings of $2,136. That would replace the central tax break for middle- and low-income Americans in last year's economic stimulus measure, White House officials said.
The deal would also continue a college-tuition tax credit for some families, expand the earned-income tax credit and allow businesses to write off the cost of certain equipment purchases. The top rate of 15 percent on capital gains and dividends would remain in place for two years, and the alternative minimum tax would be adjusted so that as many as 21 million households would not be hit by it.
In addition, the agreement provides for a 13-month extension of jobless aid for the long-term unemployed. Benefits have already started to run out for some people, and as many as seven million people would potentially lose assistance within the next year, officials said.
Congressional Republicans in recent days have blocked efforts by Democrats to extend the jobless aid, saying they would insist on offsetting the $56 billion cost with spending cuts elsewhere. White House officials said they feared a long standoff that would see benefits end for millions of Americans over the holiday season and in the months ahead.
But Mr. Obama made substantial concessions to Republicans. In addition to dropping his opposition to any extension of the current income tax rates on income above $250,000 for couples and $200,000 for individuals, he agreed to a deal on the federal estate tax that infuriated many Democrats. The deal would ultimately set an exemption of $5 million per person and a maximum rate of 35 percent -- a higher exemption and far lower rate than many Democrats wanted.
''The House Democrats have not signed off on any deal,'' Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who has been representing House Democrats in formal negotiations on the tax issue, said Monday night. ''We will thoroughly review and discuss the proposed package in the caucus.''
Some senior Democrats said an agreement by Mr. Obama to accede to Republican demands on the estate tax could lead to a revolt among lawmakers. Mr. Obama noted that he, too, still strongly disagreed with the Republican insistence on extending the tax breaks for the highest earners. ''Ever since I started running for this office, I've said that we should only extend the tax cuts for the middle class,'' he said, acknowledging that he had been thwarted in one of the chief goals of his presidency.
But he said he was determined to prevent a stalemate that would let taxes rise for everyone when the Bush-era rates are set to expire at the end of the month. ''I am not willing to let working families across this country become collateral damage for political warfare here in Washington,'' Mr. Obama said. And he said the deal included pieces that would help working-class families and accelerate the economic recovery.
Republican leaders, clearly relishing the upper hand they have held in the tax fight, reacted positively to Mr. Obama's announcement on Monday night.
A spokesman for the House Republican leader, and soon-to-be speaker, John A. Boehner, called the president's announcement ''encouraging.'' And in a statement, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, praised the administration's ''openness to preventing tax hikes.''
The size of the compromise package, roughly half of which came from extending all the Bush tax rates for two years, roughly paralleled Mr. Obama's initial $800 billion package of stimulus spending and tax cuts in early 2009 -- only this time with Republicans' tentative agreement.
While the plan's price is likely to provoke some opposition, administration officials and many economists, including Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, have been calling for additional short-term deficit spending to help stimulate the economy and create jobs, even as they argue for longer-term action to address the debt.
The report last week by the president's debt-reduction commission proposed a payroll tax break, while a separate plan from a bipartisan group led by former Senator Pete V. Domenici and Alice M. Rivlin, a former Congressional and White House budget director, proposed a one-year payroll tax holiday for all of an employee's Social Security payroll taxes, at a cost of $650 billion. And two plans from liberal groups released last week would spend hundreds of billions of dollars for public works projects and other job-creation programs.
Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, who represented Senate Republicans in the formal negotiations on the tax plan, said he would have preferred a permanent extension of all of the Bush-era tax breaks. But Mr. Kyl also expressed satisfaction with the preliminary agreement, given that Democrats control big majorities in the House and the Senate.
''Tonight's announcement marks an important first step in giving all American families and businesses the certainty that their taxes will not increase on Jan. 1,'' Mr. Kyl said in a statement. ''While I wanted the rates to be made permanent, the current political makeup of this lame-duck Congress would not allow that. What is important now is that we avert a massive tax increase that would further depress an already frail economy.''
Mr. Kyl, along with Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, was a chief architect of the version of the estate tax in the agreement with Mr. Obama. Other Senate Democrats are likely to be receptive to the proposal. The estate tax lapsed this year, but was scheduled to return on Jan. 1 with an exemption of $1 million per person and a maximum rate of 55 percent.
Republicans who deride the estate levy as the ''death tax'' have long sought to eliminate it.

HEADLINE: On a Hunt for What Makes Gamers Keep Gaming

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
By the age of 21, the typical American has spent 10,000 hours playing computer games, and endured a smaller but much drearier chunk of time listening to sermons about this sinful habit. Why, the experts wail, are so many people wasting their lives solving meaningless puzzles in virtual worlds?
Now some other experts -- ones who have actually played these games -- are asking more interesting questions. Why are these virtual worlds so much more absorbing than school and work? How could these gamers' labors be used to solve real-world puzzles? Why can't life be more like a video game?
''Gamers are engaged, focused, and happy,'' says Edward Castronova, a professor of telecommunications at Indiana University who has studied and designed online games. ''How many employers wish they could say that about even a tenth of their work force? 
''Many activities in games are not very different from work activities. Look at information on a screen, discern immediate objectives, choose what to click and drag.''
Jane McGonigal, a game designer and researcher at the Institute for the Future, sums up the new argument in her coming book, ''Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World.'' It's a manifesto urging designers to aim high -- why not a Nobel Prize? -- with games that solve scientific problems and promote happiness in daily life.
In the past, puzzles and games were sometimes considered useful instructional tools. The emperor Charlemagne hired a scholar to compile ''Problems to Sharpen the Young,'' a collection of puzzles like the old one about ferrying animals across a river (without leaving the hungry fox on the same bank as the defenseless goat). The British credited their victory over Napoleon to the games played on the fields of Eton.
But once puzzles and gaming went digital, once the industry's revenues rivaled Hollywood's, once children and adults became so absorbed that they forsook even television, then the activity was routinely denounced as ''escapism'' and an ''addiction.'' Meanwhile, a few researchers were more interested in understanding why players were becoming so absorbed and focused. They seemed to be achieving the state of ''flow'' that psychologists had used to describe master musicians and champion athletes, but the gamers were getting there right away instead of having to train for years.
One game-design consultant, Nicole Lazzaro, the president of XEODesign, recorded the facial expressions of players and interviewed them along with their friends and relatives to identify the crucial ingredients of a good game. One ingredient is ''hard fun,'' which Ms. Lazzaro defines as overcoming obstacles in pursuit of a goal. That's the same appeal of old-fashioned puzzles, but the video games provide something new: instantaneous feedback and continual encouragement, both from the computer and from the other players.
Players get steady rewards for little achievements as they amass points and progress to higher levels, with the challenges becoming harder as their skill increases.
Even though they fail over and over, they remain motivated to keep going until they succeed and experience what game researchers call ''fiero.'' The term (Italian for ''proud'') describes the feeling that makes a gamer lift both arms above the head in triumph.
It's not a gesture you see often in classrooms or offices or on the street, but game designers like Dr. McGonigal are working on that. She has designed Cruel 2 B Kind, a game in which players advance by being nice to strangers in public places, and which has been played in more than 50 cities on four continents.
She and her husband are among the avid players of Chorewars, an online game in which they earn real rewards (like the privilege of choosing the music for their next car ride) by doing chores at their apartment in San Francisco. Cleaning the bathroom is worth so many points that she has sometimes hid the toilet brush to prevent him from getting too far ahead.
Other people, working through a ''microvolunteering'' Web site called Sparked, are using a smartphone app undertake quests for nonprofit groups like First Aid Corps, which is compiling a worldwide map of the locations of defibrillators available for cardiac emergencies. Instead of looking for magical healing potions in virtual worlds, these players scour buildings for defibrillators that haven't been cataloged yet. If that defibrillator later helps save someone's life, the player's online glory increases (along with the sense of fiero).
To properly apply gaming techniques to school and work and other institutions, there are certain core principles to keep in mind, says Tom Chatfield, a British journalist and the author of ''Fun Inc.: Why Gaming Will Dominate the Twenty-First Century.'' These include using an ''experience system'' (like an avatar or a profile that levels up), creating a variety of short-term and long-term goals, and rewarding effort continually while also providing occasional unexpected rewards.
''One of the most profound transformations we can learn from games,'' he says, ''is how to turn the sense that someone has 'failed' into the sense that they 'haven't succeeded yet.'''
Some schools are starting to borrow gamers' system of quests and rewards, and the principles could be applied to lots of enterprises, especially colossal collaborations online. By one estimate, Dr. McGonigal notes, creating Wikipedia took eight years and 100 million hours of work, but that's only half the number of hours spent in a single week by people playing World of Warcraft.
''Whoever figures out how to effectively engage them first for real work is going to reap enormous benefits,'' Dr. McGonigal predicts.
Researchers like Dr. Castronova have already benefited by tracking the economic transactions and social behavior in online games. Now that Facebook and smartphones have enabled virtual communities to be created fairly cheaply, Dr. Castronova is hoping to build a prototype that could be adapted by researchers studying a variety of real-world problems.
''Social media like video games are the only research tool we've ever had that lets us do controlled experiments on large-scale problems like global warming, terrorism and pandemics,'' Dr. Castronova says. ''Not everything in virtual environments maps onto real behavior, but a heck of a lot does. Rules like 'buy low, sell high' and 'tall people are sexier' play out exactly the same way, whether the environment is virtual or real.''
Dr. Castronova envisions creating financial games to study how bubbles and panics occur, or virtual cities to see how they respond to disasters.
''One reason that policy keeps screwing up -- think Katrina -- is because it never gets tested,'' he says. ''In the real world, you can't create five versions of New Orleans and throw five hurricanes at them to test different logistics. But you can do that in virtual environments.''
Well, you can do it as long as there enough players in that virtual New Orleans who are having enough fun to keep serving as unpaid lab rats. Researchers will need the skills exhibited by Tom Sawyer when he persuaded his friends it would be a joyous privilege to whitewash a fence.
Tom discovered, as Twain explained, ''that Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.'' The ultimate challenge, when trying to extract work from the World of Warcraft questers and other players, will be persuading them that it's still just a game.

HEADLINE: DEALBOOK ONLINE; GLOOMY OUTLOOK

BYLINE: By EVELYN M. RUSLI

 BODY:
As Nouriel Roubini heads to Athens to meet with investors and policymakers potentially about the debt crisis in Europe, the economist says he's increasingly worried about a problem closer to home: America's real estate mess.
The country's real estate problems are ''underappreciated,'' and banks could face another $1 trillion in housing-related losses, Mr. Roubini said in a phone interview with DealBook on Monday. At the same time, he played down the issues in Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain, calling the matter ''contained'' for now. The United States ''real estate market, for sure, is double dipping,'' Mr. Roubini said. ''The apparent increase in prices has been fully reversed, demand is falling, and supply is going to increase.'' 
The drumbeat of bad news grows louder. Sales of existing homes fell more than expected in October, down 2.2 percent to an annual rate of 4.43 million, the lowest level in more than a decade, according to the National Association of Realtors. After rising in the second quarter, Standard & Poor's Case-Schiller home price index fell 2 percent in the third quarter.
Meanwhile the trouble is spreading across all types of borrowers, as even the most creditworthy show increasing weakness. The Mortgage Bankers Association recently announced that foreclosure starts for prime fixed-rate mortgages rose to a record high of 0.93 percent in the third quarter. Mr. Roubini said he was particularly focused on a recent study by Laurie Goodman, a senior managing director of Amherst Securities and a former co-head of fixed income research for UBS. In her October report, ''The Housing Crisis - Sizing the Problem, Proposing Solutions,'' Ms. Goodman comes to the dark conclusion that more than 11 million borrowers are in danger of losing their homes, or roughly one out of five borrowers. ''That's a scary number because the previous estimates I saw were in the three to four million range for the next four years'' Mr. Roubini said. ''Some say these numbers are too pessimistic, but I've spoken to experts in the mortgage industry who say these numbers are quite realistic.'' According to Ms. Goodman, loan modification programs have somewhat masked the problems. After a bank modifies a troubled mortgage, the loan is then reclassified as ''current'' on the books - even if the homeowner still hasn't made a payment.
Scores of mortgages, she wrote, will go bad, adding to the wave of foreclosures and short sales. For example, Goodman estimates some 70% of borrowers-those who previously defaulted on their loans but are now current-will run into trouble, again.
''The moral of the story is that there is a lot of work to be done,'' Ms. Goodman told DealBook.
Given the severity of the mortgage problems, Mr. Roubini said investors should brace for another wave of housing-related losses. Building off estimates that 11 million borrowers will lose their homes, Mr. Roubini thinks the financial industry faces $1 trillion in additional losses, assuming firms can recover 50 cents on the dollar and the average cost of a home loan is $200,000.
He added, however, that the losses will likely be spread out across the industry, and some will be absorbed without the need for additional capital.
''Losses [will be] divided between banks, investors [in residential mortgage-back securities and collateralized debt obligations] and Fannie and Freddie,'' Mr. Roubini said. ''Some [are] already realized in the market price of RMBS.'' There is another silver lining, albeit a thin one. Mr. Roubini said the mortgage mess may not necessarily derail the anemic recovery in the economy, which he thinks is still on track to grow 2.3 percent next year.
For a country where unemployment just ticked higher, that's not-so-gloomy news from Dr. Doom.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Unleashing A Creative Deluge

BYLINE: By STEVE SMITH

 BODY:
If artists, like illusionists, manufacture their own realities, then the New York composer, performer and director Mikel Rouse just might be unveiling his magnum opus this week. At the heart of his endeavor is ''Gravity Radio,'' a recent staged song cycle by Mr. Rouse, which receives its New York premiere at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Tuesday night.
But Mr. Rouse's real feat is subtler and more profound. Like most artists, he has been affected during recent seasons by recessionary woes, including canceled engagements. As if in response, he is offering a veritable deluge of creative activity this month, with ''Gravity Radio'' as its focal point. 
On Monday an exhibition of Mr. Rouse's notebooks, manuscripts and video art opened at the Margarete Roeder Gallery in SoHo. On Tuesday he releases two CDs, ''Recess'' and ''Corner Loading (Volume 1),'' on his decade-old label, Exit Music. On Wednesday ''Passport: 30 Years Drawn on the Road,'' another exhibition of Mr. Rouse's sketches and watercolors, opens at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, honoring the library's acquisition of his archive. A film retrospective opens at the library on Dec. 15, and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater revives Ulysses Dove's ''Vespers,'' set to Mr. Rouse's ''Quorum,'' on Dec. 16.
Mr. Rouse, 53, is no stranger to ambitious undertakings. Prominent in the New York downtown scene of the 1980s as the leader of Broken Consort, a new-music ensemble, and Tirez Tirez, an alternative-rock group, Mr. Rouse helped to pioneer what would now be deemed postclassical music more than three decades before the term was coined, fusing the sound, instrumentation and volume of rock with classical music's complexity and scale, and the repetition of Minimalism.
He is best known for a trilogy of operas on popular culture and mass-media saturation: ''Failing Kansas'' (1994), based on the murders in Truman Capote's ''In Cold Blood''; ''Dennis Cleveland'' (1995), inspired by television talk shows; and ''The End of Cinematics'' (1996), a dreamlike elegy for art-house film.
Like those works, the 14 songs of ''Gravity Radio,'' issued last year on Exit Music, have a pop-inspired directness and surface sheen that can disguise their contrapuntal and metrical intricacy. Interspersed among the songs are simulated news reports read by an actress, with lines borrowed seemingly at random from the song lyrics -- an effect paradoxically unifying and disorienting. Adapting the album for the stage, Mr. Rouse explained during a recent interview in his Times Square studio, partly had to do with economics.
''I simply was not going to be able to put a 13- or 14-piece ensemble on the road, especially if there was going to be a video component, because you have to have tech and crew,'' he said. ''This is probably one of the simpler shows I've done, but I like it to have a look. And I like the video to be integrated with the lighting design, so that it's not just video slapped up on a screen.'' Film shot by Mr. Rouse is meant to provide a dreamy backdrop, with a computer program adjusting luminosity according to the music's volume.
Mr. Rouse was also spurred to revisit ''Gravity Radio,'' he admitted, by listeners and critics who deemed it a pop album. Rearranging the songs for voices, acoustic guitar and string quartet to accentuate their structure, he added, helped him to approach the project anew. ''You think about Bob Dylan going out and doing different versions of his songs because he wants to stay interested,'' Mr. Rouse said. ''Basically, if you know the record, you'll know all the songs. But it's a completely different piece now because of this.''
The news reports are updated for each performance, adding a bit of chance, with only the phrases borrowed from the songs remaining constant. ''The lyrics were written in such a way as to be intentionally vague, so that if it's a story about the New York Yankees or a story about Obama, or whatever, it can still be reflective of the song lyrics,'' he said. ''Audience members connect the dots in very different ways and see a parallel between the song 'I'm So Blue' and a news report about Rwanda, and it becomes a kind of a beautiful combination of elements.''
But behind that appeal is a more serious concern: the notion of news as ''infotainment,'' as Mr. Rouse put it, ''which is CNN orchestrating the news -- how the minute there's a Katrina or something, they have a theme song for it.'' He added: ''No matter how factual the news is, you're being manipulated. Part of the idea of these news reports' being orchestrated by a string quartet was to highlight that aspect, but at the same time, hopefully, to let you reflect on it: 'O.K., this is kind of beautiful, but is this really how I want to receive my news?' ''
As if to emphasize his point further, when Mr. Rouse was asked to choose an interviewer for a postperformance conversation on Thursday, he picked Evan and Andrew Gregory, the Brooklyn artists and brothers behind the Internet series ''Auto-Tune the News,'' in which television news clips provide fodder for wickedly funny music videos.
Mr. Rouse e-mailed Academy executives a link to ''Auto-Tune the News #8,'' which he called the Gregorys' masterpiece. ''While I think they're very humorous, I really think that it's some of the better stuff going on right now in terms of mixing media and actually being really musical,'' he said. That the work was created on a shoestring budget only increased his admiration.
''I really don't think there's any excuse for someone not to make great things,'' Mr. Rouse said. ''There used to really be one, even 10 or 15 years ago, in terms of financial limitations. But you don't need this''--he swept a hand across his imposing recording console--''to make a great record.''
Perhaps not, but both his new CDs -- the dizzying ''Recess,'' on which Mr. Rouse incorporates sounds of the outside world into the music's structure, and the spare, bluesy ''Corner Loading (Volume 1),'' in which his voice and guitar shift in and out of phase almost imperceptibly -- were recorded entirely in his one-room studio. Inspired one evening to make a video for ''Great Adventure Jail'' (a track on ''Corner Loading''), Mr. Rouse shot in stark black and white from five angles, edited the clip and uploaded it to YouTube in roughly five hours -- entirely with his iPhone.
The speed at which Mr. Rouse works at least partly explains the size of the archive the Library for the Performing Arts is making available to the public.
''There's a lot,'' the executive director, Jacqueline Z. Davis, said, ''but thankfully, not only is he creative, extremely talented and very successful -- he's also organized.'' The collection, she explained, is arriving in four waves: analog master tapes; scores, manuscripts and programs; digital media; and, finally, sketchbooks, diaries, contracts and correspondence, some of which are in the exhibition.
As for Mr. Rouse, who spent the better part of two years making new projects and sorting old ones while waiting for the economy to improve, the time was right to resurface.
''I feel a little bit like it's going to be like the groundhog,'' he said. ''I'm going to raise my head out, see my shadow and go back in for another two years. Or I'm not going to see my shadow and I'll kind of get back out in the world, do some touring and get the thing going.''

HEADLINE: Still Counting on the Power of Television

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
TV or not TV? On Madison Avenue next year, leading forecasters say, that is not likely to be the question.
A major reason those forecasters are predicting that the advertising industry will recover faster from the recession than they had expected -- both in the United States and globally -- is the continued, strong demand among marketers for commercial time on television. That is being demonstrated, they say, in most developed markets as well as in emerging markets like China.
The robustness of the ardor for television ads is startling some forecasters, who had believed that the intensifying demand for online advertising would cut into sales for TV as it has for, say, newspapers. That does not seem to be the case, even as they point to a sharp climb in spending for Internet ads as another reason the recovery will proceed -- and even gain momentum -- into next year. 
''The success story, perhaps surprisingly, has been television,'' said Steve King, chief executive at the ZenithOptimedia media division of the Publicis Groupe.
TV is, by his estimates, still gaining share of the overall advertising market, he added, to 40.7 percent in 2010, from 37 percent in 2005.
Consumers' embrace of technologies like digital TV, HDTV and DVRs helps keep them watching, Mr. King said, which helps keep marketers buying commercial time.
Mr. King spoke on Monday during a panel at the opening of the 38th annual UBS global media and communications conference, which is being held in Midtown Manhattan through Wednesday. His remarks were echoed by the two other panelists as they offered forecasts for how 2010 would end and what 2011 might bring.
''TV will be adding about half of all growth next year,'' said a second panelist, Adam Smith, futures director at GroupM, the media unit of WPP.
Later, in an interview, Mr. Smith elaborated on why he thought that would be the case. For one thing, he said, television viewership is being propelled by people who are increasingly watching certain shows to share comments with friends and family in real time on social media like Facebook and Twitter.
That is particularly stimulating live viewing of programs, he added, ''which is what is monetized'' by the providers of TV content like the broadcast networks and cable channels.
A case in point is the demand for commercials during Super Bowl XLV, to be broadcast by Fox on Feb. 6. All available ad time is already sold out, and it sold out earlier than is usual, despite rates that are estimated at up to $3 million for each 30-second spot.
Even marketers that had never advertised in the previous XLIV -- er, 44 -- Super Bowls are buying spots, among them blue-chip brands like Best Buy and Mercedes-Benz.
''Television continues to be resilient,'' said another panelist, Brian Wieser, global director for forecasting at Magna Global, part of the Mediabrands division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, even as other media like mobile and the Internet are likely to grow faster.
In fact, Mr. Wieser said, he has added a category, called pay TV, to those he tracks in producing his forecasts. The new category covers television variants like cable, satellite and Internet TV delivered by phone companies.
Mr. Wieser said he foresaw no dire effects on traditional television from the growth of what is known as over-the-top TV, which is delivery of programming through the Internet by means like the new Google TV, developed by Google, Intel, Logitech and Sony.
There could be 20 million to 25 million people watching TV that way by 2020, he added. That would be a fraction of those viewers still watching TV through cable systems, satellite or even over the air.
''Despite all the other viewing options, most people still like watching TV at home on a TV set,'' said Steve Sternberg, the longtime television research analyst who writes a blog, The Sternberg Report.
As for access to TV on additional screens like PCs, tablets or smartphones, it could ''enable people to sample shows they may not have had time for on traditional TV,'' Mr. Sternberg wrote in an e-mail, as well as give viewers a chance to watch more episodes of the shows they typically watch on traditional TV.
The health of television as an ad medium clearly delighted another speaker at the conference.
''This is more like it,'' said David F. Poltrack, chief research officer at the CBS Corporation and president of its CBS Vision unit. ''After two years that have not been pleasant for any of us, things are looking up.''
Television is increasingly about ''the development, nurturing and harvesting of franchise programming,'' Mr. Poltrack said, that viewers will want to watch on conventional TV sets, the Internet, mobile devices, video on demand, DVDs and in syndication.
Among them, he listed series like the ''CSI'' shows on CBS, ''Grey's Anatomy'' on ABC, ''The Office'' on NBC and ''American Idol'' on Fox.
Three drama series that CBS introduced for the 2010-11 season -- ''Blue Bloods,'' The Defenders'' and ''Hawaii Five-0'' -- are already profitable, from their network licensing fees and international sales, Mr. Poltrack said, with additional revenue like syndication in the offing.
Even better, in Mr. Poltrack's (CBS) eye, all three series are being produced by the CBS Television Studios division of CBS.
All the forecasters on the opening panel predicted that 2010 would end with an increase in worldwide ad spending compared with last year. Their forecasts were for an increase of 4.9 percent, from Mr. King; 5.9 percent, from Mr. Smith; and 6.9 percent, from Mr. Wieser.
They all also predicted an increase in worldwide ad spending for 2011 compared with 2010. Their forecasts were for an increase of 4.6 percent, from Mr. King; 5.4 percent, from Mr. Wieser; and 5.8 percent, from Mr. Smith.

HEADLINE: DEALBOOK ONLINE; Supporting Clean Technology, a Quiet Voice With a Big Stick

BYLINE: By HEIDI N. MOORE

 BODY:
As president, Theodore Roosevelt was fond of the African proverb that advised leaders to ''speak softly and carry a big stick,'' particularly for foreign policy.
His great-grandson, Theodore Roosevelt IV, a longtime environmentalist and banker at Barclays Capital, uses the same approach to deal-making.
Massachusetts utilities regulators recently approved a proposal by National Grid to use energy from a proposed Cape Wind offshore wind farm, a cluster of 130 wind turbines that will sit in Nantucket Sound, where well-heeled and preppy American leaders and executives have sailed, recreationally, for decades. 
Mr. Roosevelt, 68, is one of that group. He has a country home on Martha's Vineyard, on the north shore of Chappaquiddick, where he still dives for scallops. When Cape Wind's giant white windmills go up, he will be able to see them.
It would seem to go against his self-interest, but that appears to depend on how you would define the terms. For Mr. Roosevelt, a conservationist who has gone listening for bird calls in Central Park, the long-term environmental benefits were more important than the view. And, as for his neighbors on the Cape, he adds, ''I'm fully convinced it's not going to have an adverse impact on home values.''
The decision, one of 17 regulatory approvals so far, was a coup for Cape Wind's supporters - including Mr. Roosevelt - after nine years of lawsuits, debates and strong opposition from a vocal and well-financed group of prominent businessmen and fellow Martha's Vineyard residents, including the billionaire Oxbow Group founder, William Koch, and a former Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney.
Opponents in the bitter battle still plan to fight it to Massachusetts's top court. Audra Parker, chief executive of the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, has never met Mr. Roosevelt but said that he had a financial interest in seeing it through, since his firm, Barclays, had been tapped to provide the financing.
Still, his support of Cape Wind preceded his advisory work. The chief executive of Cape Wind Associates, James Gordon, met Mr. Roosevelt as part of a setup on a raucous Boston conservative radio show in 2003. The radio host had expected Mr. Roosevelt, as a resident of Martha's Vineyard, to say he opposed the project. Instead, he said he was all for it, and Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Gordon got along famously.
A year later, Mr. Gordon approached Mr. Roosevelt, then at Lehman Brothers, to help provide financing for Cape Wind, anticipated at $1.3 billion. Several other banks pitched for the deal, but Mr. Gordon chose Lehman Brothers in large part because of Mr. Roosevelt.
''The fact that he was really trying to find solutions to environmental and climatic challenges made us simpatico,'' Mr. Gordon said.
There was another benefit: Mr. Roosevelt's conservationist credentials and his advice on how to approach the privileged community on the Cape were a big boon to the struggling project. ''Ted's reputation as an environmentalist precedes him,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''For him to embrace the Cape Wind project added to its stature.''
Mr. Roosevelt, who is chairman of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, is seeking to burnish his conservationist bona fides by combining his work as an investment banker with deals in clean technology.
He is one of the senior sponsors of Barclays' year-old clean-tech initiative, an effort that grew out of Lehman Brothers' alternative energy group and pulled together bankers from all over the firm to advise companies looking to finance, sell or buy clean technologies including wind, water and solar.
It helps, perhaps, that Mr. Roosevelt's polite and relaxed personal manner is at odds with a last name that could have the power to intimidate.
''He's as consistent, straightforward and positive as anyone I've ever worked with,'' said Steven Berkenfeld, another former Lehman banker who co-founded Barclays' clean-tech initiative. ''I don't see him get upset, I don't see him get frustrated.''
That's rare on Wall Street, as Mr. Berkenfeld noted, and Mr. Roosevelt himself seems an odd fit for an industry that has come under fire for its excess.
Mr. Roosevelt is trim, unassuming, and, true to his roots as a former Navy SEAL and State Department attache, notably lacking in any Wall Street flash; in a recent interview at Barclays' Midtown Manhattan headquarters, he wore an immaculately cut and very simple navy blue suit and red tie with charcoal stripes. His coordinating cufflinks were the silk knots that come as placeholders with well-made shirts. There was no giant watch, no pocket square, nothing of the bankerly peacock.
Mr. Roosevelt grew up on a farm in small-town Pennsylvania, riding horses and chasing snakes and frogs. His mother, a Kentucky native, taught him to set a trap line. He left the farm to attend Groton, the same Massachusetts boarding school that his father and grandfather attended.
Given his family's political history, he early on developed an internationalist bent. In college at Harvard in the 1960s, Roosevelt eagerly planned to join the foreign service, but first he served two tours of duty as a Navy SEAL frogman in a submarine in Vietnam
After Vietnam, he joined the State Department and was posted in West Africa. When the State Department was examining trade policy, he took a leave of absence to learn more about it at the Harvard Business School. While there - and during a summer working at the now-defunct Kidder Peabody - he found he preferred the more flexible world of banking to the straitlaced world of international diplomacy. His family accepted the idea: ''The only rule in my family was: whatever you do, you should do it well,'' he said.
In his interests, he still sounds more like an international policy wonk than a deal maker. He considered a run for the Senate last year, quotes Hubert Humphrey on America's ''third-rate knowledge of the world'' and predicts a future when nation-states, delineated by sharp boundaries and unilateral wars, will be overthrown for ''market-states,'' in which economic and political cooperation will be necessary to fight terrorism.
This view of the world is where Mr. Roosevelt's Wall Street loyalties come into play. He believes that banks will, again, be ascendant.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Store Limits Bell Ringing, And Charity Feels a Loss

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Donations to the Salvation Army in the Washington area have fallen 15 percent below last year's in the first two weeks of its Christmas season bell-ringing campaign, officials from the organization said, dragged down by the continuing recession and a new limit on ringing outside Giant Food stores.
Giant announced the limit in October, in what it said was an effort to allow more local nonprofit organizations access to its customers. Giant allows only one organization at a time to solicit in front of its stores. The Salvation Army previously had exclusive rights from Nov. 12 to Dec. 24, but this year is limited to one week in November and one week in December, a Giant spokesman said. 
Giant stores made up about half of all collections in the Washington area in past ringing campaigns, and Salvation Army officials are raising concerns about possible collection shortfalls. Last year, the local Salvation Army raised about $667,000 in front of Giant stores, about half of the total $1.35 million it collected. Giant has 179 stores, all near Washington, including Maryland, Delaware and Northern Virginia.
In the 16 days that ended Dec. 1, Washington-area Salvation Army ringers collected $404,894, or about 15 percent less than in the same period last year, said Kenneth Forsythe, a spokesman for the organization. It collected $68,271 outside Giant stores, a 75 percent drop from the same period last year, Mr. Forsythe said.
He said he was not aware of any reduction in hours imposed by other stores in other parts of the country.
Jennifer Byrd, the national public relations manager for the Salvation Army, said that because of the charity's local structure, she would not necessarily know of other restrictions.
The decline comes as demand from needy families has increased, causing concern among Salvation Army officials that they will not be able to cover the growing need. The organization helps families pay rent, utility and food bills, along with other essentials.
''This is the perfect storm for us,'' said Maj. Steven Morris, the commander for the Salvation Army in the Washington area. ''We don't have a ready-made plan to make up what we could lose.''
The recession has hit hard in the area. This year, the Salvation Army here provided Thanksgiving food assistance to about 8,000 people, up from about 5,000 last year. The number of meals served to the hungry in 2009 was 139,568, up by more than a third from 2008. Unemployment benefits are starting to expire, Major Morris said, pressing more families into desperate situations.
''We're uncomfortable turning families away right now,'' he said. ''And it's not going to get any better in January.''
Jamie Miller, the Giant spokesman, said it was precisely the worsening economic conditions that prompted the store to reassess its strategy with charities.
Giant gets hundreds of requests for permission to collect money or signatures, Mr. Miller said, and with the recession cutting into giving this holiday season, Giant opted to give more nonprofits access to its customers.
''We wanted to open up our stores for other nonprofits,'' he said.
Among the charities with increased access are youth athletic teams, local high school groups, Boy Scouts, a women's group, and a local food pantry. Giant now allows charities to solicit from Monday to Saturday, instead of weekends only, Mr. Miller said.
Major Morris argued that the Salvation Army was a group with broader appeal whose cause was exclusively needy families in the area, as opposed to other charities with narrower causes.
''The Salvation Army stands for something different,'' he said. ''It's not selling a product. It sustains the lives of those who are without right now.''

HEADLINE: DEALBOOK ONLINE; FAILURE

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's multitrillion-dollar effort to save the financial system helped prop up hundreds of ailing banks.
But not every institution fared so well.
Some 20 American banks that tapped tens of billions of dollars from the Fed's various emergency lending programs later failed, according to data the Fed released last week. The shuttered banks, all once deemed by the Fed to be relatively healthy, ranged from small community banks in Florida to big savings institutions like Washington Mutual, which was the largest bank in American history to fail.
The Fed's liquidity injection into these banks was no match for the mounds of risky loans on their books, said Sabeth Siddique, who led the Fed's credit risk department during the financial crisis. ''Unfortunately, the credit risk was so large that the liquidity couldn't save them,'' said Mr. Siddique, now a director for Deloitte. 
Commercial real estate loans and other risky assets were ''eating away at their capital,'' he said.
The Fed's larger emergency borrowers, including Merrill Lynch, survived but ultimately merged with healthier institutions to stay afloat. Bank of America took over Merrill at the beginning of 2009. Meanwhile, more than $14 billion in central bank loans could not keep Lehman Brothers from going bankrupt in September 2008.
''It's not surprising'' that some of the Fed's borrowers still failed, said Dean Baker, an economist who leads the Center for Economic and Policy Research. ''If you have complete basket-case banks, it's hard to help them out.''
As banks big and small struggled to find financing in late 2007, the Fed opened the Term Auction Facility to provide short-term loans to those in ''generally sound financial condition.''
The Fed only extended TAF loans to banks that were considered adequately capitalized. The Fed also relied on reports from other banking regulators, like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Turns out, not all TAF recipients continued to fit the bill.
First National Bank of Nevada, First Federal Bank of California and La Jolla Bank all took TAF loans just months before they collapsed. Washington Mutual obtained a $500 million loan from the Fed on Feb. 14, 2008, but roughly seven months later it collapsed into the arms of JPMorgan Chase.
It is unclear whether additional Fed loans would have saved those banks that failed. But, Mr. Baker said, ''it does raise the question of who the Fed turned away.'' The Fed has not disclosed which institutions - if any - it rejected for TAF loans.
For its part, the Fed fared better than some of its borrowers. The central bank has not lost any money from its emergency programs, and it does not expect to, the Fed said.
''The Federal Reserve followed sound risk-management practices in administering all of these programs, incurred no credit losses on programs that have been wound down, and expects to incur no credit losses on the few remaining programs,'' the Fed said in a statement.
The Fed created the TAF program in late 2007 when some banks balked at borrowing from the Fed's discount window. The banks feared the stigma that might come from visiting the discount window, and so opted for the TAF program, which offered anonymity to its borrowers (until now).
WaMu and the smaller community banks that failed banks received 28-day or 84-day TAF loans, which came with interest rates of 1 percent to 5 percent.
The Fed also lent to big broker-dealers through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, a cheap overnight loan system for banks. Before Sept. 14, 2008, the day Merrill agreed to be sold and Lehman failed, both firms tapped this facility for loans.
Because the Fed's emergency lending programs were largely created for big banks, a ''double standard'' existed, said Paul Merski, senior vice president and chief economist for the Independent Community Bankers Association. ''There should have been a focus on what will actually work for banks that aren't publicly traded.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Justices to Rule on States' Emissions Case

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
The Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear arguments on whether plaintiffs can turn to the courts to seek reductions in emissions by coal-burning utilities on the ground that the emissions are a ''public nuisance.'' 
The court will hear an appeal of a 2009 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, allowing a suit filed against the utilities by eight states, New York City and three land trusts to proceed. A lower court had dismissed the suit, calling the regulation of emissions a political matter.
The suit, brought in 2004, argued that the utilities were creating a public nuisance by burning coal and spewing heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to the problem of global warming. At the time the lawsuit was considered an alternative to federal legislation or regulation, which had been slow in coming.
It is the first public-nuisance suit related to climate change to reach the Supreme Court. Lower courts have generally declined to allow such suits to proceed because it would put judges in the position of deciding how much carbon dioxide was too much.
In their appeal of the Second Circuit's reinstatement of the suit, the utilities -- American Electric Power, the Southern Company, Xcel Energy, the Cinergy Corporation and the Tennessee Valley Authority -- said the emissions issue was a matter for Congress.
The Obama administration urged the Supreme Court to hear the appeal but for a somewhat different reason, saying the nuisance claim would interfere with its current efforts to regulate carbon dioxide through the Environmental Protection Agency. The Supreme Court held in 2007 that greenhouse gases were pollutants under the Clean Air Act and therefore could be regulated by the E.P.A.
The states -- California, Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin -- and other plaintiffs urged the Supreme Court to reject the appeal.
In their original lawsuit, the states cited studies by the United Nations and the National Academy of Sciences predicting threats to the environment from greenhouse-gas emissions and global warming. The land trusts said that rising sea levels linked to climate change would inundate their properties, among other problems.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor has recused herself because she sat on the Second Circuit panel that heard arguments in the case.
Tracy Hester, a professor at University of Houston Law Center specializing in environmental issues, said a Supreme Court ruling could potentially determine who has the standing in such lawsuits -- and whether they can be brought in the absence of specific legislation or federal regulations on emission limits.
New Mexico to Cut Emissions
By a vote of 4 to 1, New Mexico regulators on Monday adopted a plan for a 3 percent annual cut in greenhouse-gas emissions from the state's biggest polluters.
The cuts, which would be based on 2010 emissions and would take effect in 2013, would put New Mexico in a league with California among states with the most stringent controls on greenhouse-gas emissions.
The move, combined with state incentives for alternative energy projects, ''puts New Mexico on course to compete in the clean-energy economy,'' said Mariel Nanasi, senior policy adviser with New Energy Economy, the advocacy group that proposed the measure.
Industry groups had opposed the rule.

HEADLINE: Direct Talks Concerning Iran's Nuclear Program Begin

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
GENEVA -- The United States and other world powers pressed Iran on Monday to assuage international fears that it intended to build a nuclear bomb, meeting here in the first direct talks since October 2009 on the country's nuclear program and its failure to obey United Nations Security Council resolutions to stop enriching uranium.
The talks, which are to continue Tuesday, were described as difficult. One official directly involved, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were continuing, said that there was little of substance, considerable speechifying, and that both sides ''rehearsed well-known positions.''
Iranian officials stated from the start that the country would not compromise on its right to enrich uranium, which it says is only for peaceful purposes. Few in the West or the Middle East consider that assertion credible, given Iran's history of concealment of its nuclear facilities, its missile program and its limited need for nuclear fuel for its power plant reactors. 
At a minimum, the United States and other powers hope to get a commitment to meet again with a more concrete agenda, perhaps in Turkey, where Iran originally proposed to hold the talks.
A tentative agreement in October 2009 to send most of Iran's enriched uranium out of the country to be turned into fuel for a medical reactor fell apart amid internal Iranian political disputes, and since then Iran's centrifuges have been turning, despite difficulties with production and computer malware.
Iran is now thought by Western officials to have about 7,000 pounds of lightly enriched uranium, about twice what it had in 2009, and about 73 pounds of uranium enriched to about 20 percent, of which it had none in 2009. Iran now has about 4,800 centrifuges known to be spinning away.
But senior Western officials are not at all sure that Iran has disclosed all its enrichment facilities to the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and senior officials worry that Iran might have more sophisticated centrifuges, known as P-2's, that it has not disclosed.
Western officials said that the talks began at 10 a.m. around an oval table of pale wood with the Iranian delegation leader, Saeed Jalili, condemning the assassination on Nov. 29 of a physicist, Majid Shahriari, in a car bombing that wounded his wife, and a similar attack that same day on another nuclear scientist, Fereydoon Abbasi. Mr. Abbasi was wounded in the attack. Iran blamed the West for both attacks.
The chief negotiator for the other delegations, Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign affairs chief, also condemned the killing.
Then the representatives from the European Union, United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China spoke of the need to discuss the Iranian nuclear program and restore the world's trust in Iran's claim that its nuclear program is only for civilian purposes, as allowed under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Western officials said.
After lunch, some held bilateral meetings with the Iranians. But there was no such meeting between Mr. Jalili and William J. Burns, the American under secretary of state for political affairs, the officials said. Mr. Jalili met separately, officials said, with Ms. Ashton and the heads of the Chinese and Russian delegations. A second plenary session, with all the delegates, started about 5:50 p.m.
''We did not meet with the Iranians bilaterally,'' an American official said, speaking on the ground rules of anonymity. ''Others did and delivered the unified message that Iran needs to address the international community's concern about its nuclear program.''
Sergei Rybakov, a deputy foreign minister who heads the Russian delegation, was quoted by Iranian media as telling Mr. Jalili: ''We needed this round of talks, and during the negotiations we will try to help to remove obstacles.''
Ahead of the talks, Michael A. Hammer, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in Geneva that the United States and its allies were looking to see if Iran would enter into discussions ''with the seriousness of purpose required to begin to address international concerns.''
The British defense minister, Liam Fox, said that the talks needed to make a serious start toward resolving the issue. ''We want a negotiated solution, not a military one -- but Iran needs to work with us to achieve that outcome,'' he said in London. ''We will not look away or back down.''
The Obama administration has tried to pull Iran into regular talks on regional and global issues, as well as on the nuclear issue, in return for a halt or suspension in enrichment. But Iran has steadily refused, and the tentative October 2009 deal did include an acknowledgment that the country could continue to enrich, contingent on exporting most of its enriched uranium and talking seriously about how to prove to the world that its intentions are peaceful.
While Washington officials said that this was just a ''confidence-building measure'' and that they still demanded a suspension of enrichment during talks, some analysts suggested a compromise to allow some enrichment in return for major Iranian concessions, including on international inspections. It would also let Iran say that its right to enrichment for peaceful purposes had been recognized.
A French specialist on Iran, Thierry Coville of the Institute of International and Strategic Relations, said that the ''right to civilian nuclear power is one of the few themes that create true consensus in Iran and on which the regime can claim national unity.''
President Obama had said he would decide on new sanctions by the end of 2009; in fact, new, stronger sanctions were only voted on by the Security Council this June. While this fourth round of sanctions seem to have gotten Iran's attention and caused significant economic difficulties, especially for banking and trade, the country's public position has not changed, and it has complained bitterly about the atomic energy agency inspectors acting as ''spies.''
China has been most reluctant to use strong sanctions against Iran, followed by Russia. On Sunday, Mr. Obama called his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, to stress ''the importance of P5+1 unity'' at the talks, the White House said in a statement, referring to permanent five voting members of the Security Council plus Germany. Iran's deputy secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, Ali Bagheri, met with the Russian representative, Mr. Rybakov, Sunday night in Geneva, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
Just before the talks began, Iran announced that it had made some of its own yellowcake, a mined uranium necessary as a precursor. But Iran has little uranium and it is of poor quality, so the general assumption is that the announcement was a tactic designed to improve its position at these talks, and to give the Iranian public some sense of victory if Iran shows any compromise here.
Iran's public stance has been aggressive. On a visit to Athens on Monday, the Iranian foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, blamed foreign agents for killing the nuclear scientist. ''We believe some of the secret foreign services have been involved,'' Mr. Mottaki said. ''Those who think murders and military violence can destroy nuclear technology have made a big mistake.''
While he said he hoped for ''positive results'' in Geneva, speaking of Iran's enrichment program, Mr. Mottaki said: ''We can't put them up for negotiation. When all the countries say that they recognize Iran's right to develop peaceful nuclear technology, there is no room for such questions.'' Iran has often called for total global nuclear disarmament.
Both the United States and Israel have said that they will not allow Iran to make a nuclear weapon, and both countries have not ruled out the use of military force against Iran.

HEADLINE: STATE'S SECRETS DAY 9; America Prods and Protests But Can't Halt Arms Trade

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ANDREW W. LEHREN; Michael R. Gordon reported from Washington, and Andrew W. Lehren from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Just a week after President Bashar al-Assad of Syria assured a top State Department official that his government was not sending sophisticated weapons to Hezbollah, the Obama administration lodged a confidential protest accusing Syria of doing precisely what it had denied doing.
''In our meetings last week it was stated that Syria is not transferring any 'new' missiles to Lebanese Hizballah,'' noted a cable sent by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in February, using an alternative spelling for the militant group. ''We are aware, however, of current Syrian efforts to supply Hizballah with ballistic missiles. I must stress that this activity is of deep concern to my government, and we strongly caution you against such a serious escalation.''
A senior Syrian Foreign Ministry official, a cable from the American Embassy in Damascus reported, flatly denied the allegation. But nine months later, administration officials assert, the flow of arms had continued to Hezbollah. According to a Pentagon official, Hezbollah's arsenal now includes up to 50,000 rockets and missiles, including some 40 to 50 Fateh-110 missiles capable of reaching Tel Aviv and most of Israel, and 10 Scud-D missiles. The newly fortified Hezbollah has raised fears that any future conflict with Israel could erupt into a full-scale regional war. 
The Syrian episode offers a glimpse of the United States' efforts to prevent buildups of arms -- including Scud missiles, Soviet-era tanks and antiaircraft weapons -- in some of the world's tensest regions. Wielding surveillance photos and sales contracts, American diplomats have confronted foreign governments about shadowy front companies, secretive banks and shippers around the globe, according to secret State Department cables obtained by WikiLeaks and made available to several news organizations.
American officials have tried to block a Serbian black marketer from selling sniper rifles to Yemen. They have sought to disrupt the sale of Chinese missile technology to Pakistan, the cables show, and questioned Indian officials about chemical industry exports that could be used to make poison gas.
But while American officials can claim some successes -- Russia appears to have deferred delivery of the S-300 air defense system to Iran -- the diplomats' dispatches underscore how often their efforts have been frustrated in trying to choke off trade by Syria and others, including Iran and North Korea.
The United States is the world's largest arms supplier, and with Russia, dominates trade in the developing world. Its role as a purveyor of weapons to certain allies -- including Israel, Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states -- has drawn criticism that it has fueled an arms race. But it has also taken on a leading role as traffic cop in trying to halt deliveries of advanced weapons and other arms to militants and adversaries.
According to the cables, American diplomats have repeatedly expressed concern that huge cargo planes operated by Badr Airlines of Sudan were flying weapons from Tehran to Khartoum, Sudan, where they were shipped to Hamas, the militant group in Gaza.
Sudan insisted that the cargo was farm equipment, but the United States asked countries in the region to deny overflight rights to the airlines. Jordan and several other countries agreed, but Yemen declined, a February 2009 cable reported.
Egyptian officials, who view Iran with deep wariness, privately issued a threat. Omar Suleiman, the chief of Egypt's intelligence service, told Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that Iran not only was providing $25 million a month to support Hamas but also was linked to a Hezbollah cell trying to smuggle arms from Gaza into Egypt, according to an April 2009 cable.
''Egypt had sent a clear message to Iran that if they interfere in Egypt, Egypt will interfere in Iran,'' noted the cable, adding that the Egyptian official said his country had trained agents for that purpose.
North Korea has abetted the arms race in the Middle East by providing missile technology to Iran and Syria, which then backed Hamas and Hezbollah, according to American intelligence officials and a cable from Mrs. Clinton. The cables tell something of an international detective story: how North Korea's arms industry has conducted many of its transactions through the Korea Mining and Development Corporation, relied on suppliers of machinery and steel from countries including Switzerland, Japan, China and Taiwan, passed money through Chinese and Hong Kong banks and sold weapons to other countries.
To disrupt the transactions, American officials have prodded and protested. Diplomats raised questions in the spring of 2009, for example, about planned purchases from North Korea of rocket launchers by Sri Lanka and Scud missile launchers by Yemen.
In July 2009, Stuart A. Levey, a senior United States Treasury official, warned a top official of the People's Bank of China that ''Chinese banks have been targeted by North Korea as the main access point into the international financial system,'' according to one cable. And in meetings in Hong Kong that month, Mr. Levey complained that a local businessman was helping procure luxury goods for the North Korean leadership. (The Hong Kong banks later suggested that they had shut down the man's accounts.)
It is the arms transactions involving Syria and Hezbollah, however, that appear to be among the Obama administration's gravest concerns. President Obama came into office pledging to engage with Syria, arguing that the Bush administration's efforts to isolate Syria had done nothing to wean it from Iran or encourage Middle East peace efforts.
Even before American diplomats began talks with the Assad government, Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, prodded Mr. Assad in a February 2009 meeting in Damascus to make a gesture that he could take back to the Obama administration as ''an indicator of Assad's good will.'' Mr. Kerry told Mr. Assad that Mr. Obama intended to withdraw American troops from Iraq ''as soon as possible'' and also hinted to a senior Syrian official that the Obama administration intended to take a firm line against the establishment of new Israeli settlements on the West Bank.
''It is not our goal for the United States to be humiliated,'' Mr. Assad said, referring to Iraq, according to a cable.
In March 2009, a delegation of State Department and National Security Council officials traveled to Damascus for the first discussions, and in the next several months, each side made some modest gestures.
The United States provided information ''regarding a potential threat to a Syrian official'' through Syria's Washington ambassador and allowed a senior aide to George J. Mitchell, the American Middle East negotiator, to attend a Syrian holiday event at the Syrian Embassy, a cable reported. Syria, for its part, allowed the Americans to reopen an English-language school and hosted a team of American military officials to discuss how to better regulate the Syria-Iraq border.
Each side, however, wanted the other to take the first major initiative. Syria kept pressing for the lifting of economic sanctions, which had crippled its aviation industry, and the Americans urged Syria to curtail its support for Hezbollah and Hamas.
''The U.S. had publicly recognized its mistakes, e.g. use of torture methods, and would continue to take steps,'' Daniel B. Shapiro, a senior official on the National Security Council told the Syrians in the meeting, according to a May 2009 cable. ''But others needed to reciprocate to ensure that the opportunity did not pass.''
By the fall, however, officials at the American Embassy in Damascus appeared concerned that military developments were outpacing the incremental diplomacy.
''Syria's determined support of Hizballah's military build-up, particularly the steady supply of longer-range rockets and the introduction of guided missiles could change the military balance and produce a scenario significantly more destructive than the July-August 2006 war,'' said a November 2009 cable from the American charge d'affaires in Damascus.
According to cables, Syrian leaders appeared to believe that the weapons shipments increased their political leverage with the Israelis. But they made Lebanon even more of a tinderbox and increased the prospect that a future conflict might include Syria.
A major worry was that Syria or Iran had provided Hezbollah with Fateh-110 missiles, with the range to strike Tel Aviv. (A United States government official said last week that the 40 to 50 missiles were viewed as especially threatening because they are highly accurate.) Israeli officials told American officials in November 2009 that if war broke out, they assumed that Hezbollah would try to launch 400 to 600 rockets at day and sustain the attacks for at least two months, the cables note.
In February, the White House announced that a new American ambassador would be sent to Syria after a five-year hiatus. The next day, William J. Burns, a State Department under secretary, met with the Syrian leader.
During the session, Mr. Burns repeated American concerns about weapons smuggling to Hezbollah, one dispatch noted. Mr. Assad replied that while he could not be Israel's policeman, no ''new'' weapons were being sent to Hezbollah.
Soon after the meeting, though, a cable noted that the Americans received intelligence reports that the Syrians were about to provide Hezbollah with Scud-D missiles, which are based on North Korean technology. (Some recent intelligence reports conclude that the group has about 10 such missiles stored in a Syrian warehouse that Hezbollah uses, according to American officials. The Defense Intelligence Agency believes that two have probably been moved to Lebanon, according to the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity.) The United States officials also worried about Hezbollah's vow to avenge the death of Imad Mughniyah, a senior fighter killed in a 2008 car bombing the militant group said was the work of the Israelis.
In a classified cable in February, Mrs. Clinton directed the embassy to deliver a warning to Faisal al-Miqdad, the deputy foreign minister. ''I know you are a strategic thinker, which is why I want to underscore for you that, from our perspective, your operational support for Hizballah is a strategic miscalculation that is damaging your long-term national interests.''
The Syrian official's response was dismissive, according to an American cable. He denied that any weapons had been sent, argued that Hezbollah would not take military action if not provoked and expressed surprise at the stern American protest. The complaint, he said, ''shows the U.S. has not come to a mature position (that would enable it) to differentiate between its own interests and Israel's.''

HEADLINE: North Korea Is Sign of Chilled U.S.-China Relations

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES and DAVID E. SANGER; Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BEIJING --President Obama and President Hu Jintao of China talked by telephone on Monday about North Korea, culminating 13 days of effort by the White House to persuade China's leaders to discuss a crisis that many experts fear could escalate into military action.
Administration officials say they have no evidence Mr. Hu was ducking the call, which the Chinese knew would urge them to crack down on their unruly ally, a step Beijing clearly is highly reluctant to take amid a leadership succession in North Korea. White House officials insisted that the long delay was simply the result of scheduling problems.
But in Beijing, both Chinese and American officials and analysts have another explanation: the long silence epitomizes the speed with which relations between Washington and Beijing have plunged into a freeze. This year has witnessed the longest period of tension between the two capitals in a decade. And if anything, both sides appear to be hardening their positions. 
''The issues that used to be on the positive side of the ledger are increasingly on the negative side of the ledger, starting with North Korea,'' Bonnie Glaser, a China scholar at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an interview last week. ''I don't think this is easily repairable, and I think we're going to have a fairly cold relationship over the next two years, and potentially longer.''
Mr. Obama came into office seeking just the opposite: a new rapprochement with a rising power whose deep economic ties with the United States all but demand closer diplomatic ones. But the days when the White House spoke of a ''G-2'' that would manage the world economy and more, a phrase that preceded the first meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu in the depths of the financial crisis in early 2009, are long over.
Instead, he faces a problem very similar to the one Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton described in March 2009 during a lunch with Kevin Rudd, a China expert who was then Australia's prime minister, according to a cable recounting their conversation that was in a newly released trove of WikiLeaks documents.
Mrs. Clinton was said to have asked Mr. Rudd, ''How do you deal toughly with your banker?'''
The latest bad sign is that cooperation on managing North Korea's nuclear ambitions, which began with considerable promise in 2009, appears to have disintegrated.
On Monday, Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to convene an emergency meeting in Washington with her Japanese and South Korean counterparts about both the North's shelling of a South Korean island last month, and its recent disclosure of a new nuclear facility that potentially expands its nuclear arsenal. China, the only nation with real sway over the North Korean leadership, will not be there.
To the contrary, China's strategy on North Korea is at odds with that of Washington and its allies. In Monday's telephone call with Mr. Hu, the White House said, Mr. Obama said North Korea's new enrichment facility flouted commitments it made during the six-party talks on curbing its nuclear program, and urged China's help in sending ''a clear message to North Korea that its provocations are unacceptable.''
One former Chinese official with close ties to the government dismissed the American approach last week as characteristically legalistic. The former official, who would not be named because he is not authorized to speak on the topic, said China's strategy is to reassure the Koreans about their security, not lecture them about diplomatic obligations.
Indeed, China's strongest public reaction to last month's shelling of South Korea has not been to condemn the North, but to criticize Washington's response -- joint war games with South Korea that put the American carrier George Washington and its strike force in the Yellow Sea, off China's borders.
After Mr. Obama's national security team met last Tuesday night, administration officials began saying that the United States would conduct more military exercises near North Korea and China should the North engage in further provocations. It was an unmistakable message to Beijing that failing to rein in its ally would only increase an American military presence that China loathes.
But the lack of cooperation on North Korea only hints at the deterioration in the U.S.-China relationship.
In another leaked diplomatic cable, the American ambassador to Beijing, Jon Huntsman, wrote last January that the United States faced ''a challenging year ahead'' in relations with China, adding: ''We need to find ways to keep the relationship positive.''
Instead, two successive meetings between Mr. Obama and China's top leaders in recent months have yielded little change in China's management of its currency. A China-based attack on Google computers early this year riveted attention on Beijing's potential for cyberwar, and provoked nasty exchanges on the two nations' concepts of free speech. In public and private, China bitterly accuses the United States of engineering the award in October of the Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, in an effort to undermine its government.
And those are but lowlights of a year in which Chinese officials have railed loudly and publicly against what they consider to be American efforts to smother their rightful emergence on the global stage.
No outsiders can peer inside the black box where Chinese policies are made. But rumors abound that Beijing's leadership decided in the last year that the United States' faltering after the 2008 economic crisis had handed Beijing an opportunity to seize the global initiative.
''They feel the ball is at their feet,'' one well-connected Chinese political analyst, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, said in an interview. ''The economic crisis was the main thing. China could really say 'no' to the U.S.''
By comparison, he said, Washington has little leverage over Chinese policies.
There are doubtless other factors at work. China's domestic Internet is being bombarded by ardent nationalists whose sheer volume of comments may sway official policy. The government faces a difficult succession in 2012 -- one in which the safe route for every contender for power is to hew to solidly pro-China ideology.
Nor are Americans ready to accept a world in which their top-dog status is at considerable risk.
''A lot of America hasn't caught up with the fact that China now can say no more often,'' said Russell Leigh Moses, a Beijing-based analyst of China's leadership. ''When you've got a 6-year-old and he throws a whiffle ball against a window and it bounces off harmlessly, nobody thinks anything of it.
''But when he's older, and he throws a hardball, you've got a broken window.''
The difficulty in connecting Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu is reminiscent of the last moment of deep tension between the two countries in early 2001, after a Chinese fighter collided with an American spy plane trailing just off the Chinese coast, sending the American plane and its crew into an emergency landing on Chinese soil.
President George W. Bush spent more than a week trying to get his counterpart, Jiang Zemin, on the phone. The Chinese -- clearly trying to sort out how to handle the crisis -- declined to take the call until their internal debate was over. The American crew was eventually returned; the Chinese sent the plane back in a box, after disassembling and inspecting every component.
Several current and former American officials, as well as foreign diplomats, say they suspect that this time, the Chinese leadership is still debating how to balance its interest in propping up North Korea with their interest in preventing more incidents or another nuclear test, which would be North Korea's third.
But the outside world may never know, particularly after candid discussions about North Korea between American and Chinese officials have been revealed in WikiLeaks documents.
''The Chinese don't like talking about this stuff,'' one senior American official put it two weeks ago, after the North revealed its new nuclear site. ''And they certainly don't like talking about it over the phone.''

HEADLINE: In Deal With G.O.P., a Portent for the Next 2 Years

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For President Obama, this is what bipartisanship looks like in the new era: messy, combustible and painful, brought on under the threat of even more unpalatable consequences and yet still deferring the ultimate resolution for another day.
For the first time since his party's drubbing in last month's election, and arguably for the first time on a major domestic policy since he took office, Mr. Obama forged a deal with the Republican opposition, swallowing hard to give up a central campaign promise while maneuvering to win enough other priorities to declare partial victory. 
In that deal come the first clues to how he plans to govern for the next two years with a divided Congress, an anemic economy and his own re-election looming on the horizon. He made clear he was willing to alienate his liberal base in the interest of compromise, more interested in crafting measures that can pass to the benefit of the middle class than waging battle to the end over principle. And in the process, he is gambling he can convince the American people that he is the bridge-builder they thought he was.
''I know there's some people in my own party and in the other party who would rather prolong this battle, even if we can't reach a compromise,'' Mr. Obama said in announcing the bipartisan agreement on tax cuts and unemployment benefits. ''But I'm not willing to let working families across this country become collateral damage for political warfare here in Washington.''
This was not a compromise he could relish. Ending the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of households was a major theme of his campaign in 2008. But if he had to agree to a two-year extension, he exacted a price from Republicans in the form of extended unemployment benefits, a temporary payroll tax cut to help the working class and the continuation of tax breaks for parents and students.
Unlike with other issues, Mr. Obama and the Republicans had a powerful incentive to split the difference, an implacable end-of-the-year deadline that would have resulted in a tax increase for nearly every American. Moreover, he arguably just punted the issue into the 2012 campaign.
The White House was careful not to extrapolate too much from one deal. Still, after Mr. Obama got passage of sweeping economic stimulus, health care and financial regulation measures with virtually no Republican support, this represents something of a break, and centrists and Republicans saw hope for a more collaborative two years.
''This is the first in a series of painful deals that the president will have to cut if he is to move us forward for the next two years,'' said Matt Bennett, vice president of Third Way, an advocacy group of moderate Democrats, and a veteran of Bill Clinton's White House. ''It is proof that he is governing as an adult, looking for opportunities to negotiate.''
Frank J. Donatelli, chairman of Gopac, a Republican group, and White House political director under Ronald Reagan, said the opposition would welcome the move. ''It's the first time he has ever defied his base, which is a small step in the right direction,'' Mr. Donatelli said. ''It will make him a better president to govern from the center.''
But to his base, this is just the latest and most outrageous betrayal in what it sees as a two-year cycle of caving to conservative pressure and Republican obstructionism. The litany from the left is now familiar: Mr. Obama was too modest in his stimulus package, too afraid to fight for a government-sponsored option in his health plan, too deferential to Wall Street in his financial reforms, too weak to stand up to the generals on Afghanistan.
''Obama may have just ensured that he'll face a significant challenge to his renomination in 2012 from inside the Democratic Party,'' said Norman Solomon, a leader of Progressive Democrats of America. ''By giving away the store on such a momentous tax issue, he has now done huge damage to a large portion of the progressive base that helped to make him president.''
Mr. Solomon added, ''If he thinks that won't have major effects on his re-election chances, he's been swallowed up by a delusional bubble.''
For the moment, no credible primary challenger to Mr. Obama has emerged. But the anger on Monday extended beyond party activists. Democratic Congressional leaders acutely remember being cut out of the action when Mr. Clinton ''triangulated'' with Republicans in the 1990s, and Mr. Obama's tax deal may provoke an open revolt.
Tony Fratto, a White House official under George W. Bush, said Mr. Obama failed to lay the groundwork with his own party. ''Although the outcome here was inevitable, it will have real consequences for the president's relationship with Congressional Democrats and his base,'' Mr. Fratto said.
Mr. Obama seemed to recognize that during his remarks on Monday evening and addressed disappointed supporters.
''Sympathetic as I am to those who prefer a fight over compromise, as much as the political wisdom may dictate fighting over solving problems, it would be the wrong thing to do,'' he said. ''The American people didn't send us here to wage symbolic battles or win symbolic victories.''

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts: Surveying the Battlefield

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Deal to Extend Bush's Tax Cuts Is Seen as Near'' (front page, Dec. 6) and ''Let's Not Make a Deal,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Dec. 6):
Holding much-needed relief for millions of desperate unemployed Americans hostage to tax cuts for multimillionaires is despicable. 
Any ''compromise'' that links these two issues would only be a harbinger of further stalemates in Congress, all at the expense of the welfare of the vast majority of all those Americans -- ''the American people'' -- that the G.O.P. so confidently claims to represent.
Mr. Krugman is right to decry such ''blackmail.''
Janet Kehl Arrowsic, Me., Dec. 6, 2010
To the Editor:
In 2008 I voted for Barack Obama with an audacity of hope that he'd change Bush-era policies that had had a devastating economic effect on this country.
There is no economic or ethical reason to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. Nor is there any political justification for them.
If President Obama plans to extend Bush tax policies even temporarily, I'll actively search for another president to represent me in 2012. I didn't vote for Mr. Obama to give a third term to George W. Bush.
Rich Orloff New York, Dec. 6, 2010
To the Editor:
Democrats should stop acting as if they are in a position of weakness in the debate over Bush tax cut extensions. Regardless of the imminent majority change in the next House, Democrats, on this issue at least, will not be in a position of weakness.
If nothing is done, and all cuts expire at year's end, the concentration of those making under $250,000 a year will be less focused on preserving the cuts of the wealthy and more channeled toward rescuing their own. That's political strength.
Paul Krugman is correct: unless some spine is exhibited on this issue, we are on the road to more blackmail and perhaps a government shutdown.
Elliot Tetenbaum Cornwall, N.Y., Dec. 6, 2010
To the Editor:
Paul Krugman is right on the mark. ''Just say no'' should be the mantra, and Democrats, independents and even Republicans should rally with this message. Invest in America's future by paying for the last 10 years sooner while still protecting those in need and less well off in the bargain.
Only by raising the income levels of all, with jobs and a social safety net, will the United States move toward a positive economy. Let's spend on infrastructure, conservation, energy alternatives and prevention -- a new jobs corps.
Trimming military spending, Congressional earmarks and subsidies for those with more than enough should also be high on the agenda.
Vincent McGee New York, Dec. 6, 2010
To the Editor:
Re ''Senate Rejects President's Plan on Tax Breaks'' (front page, Dec. 5):
President Obama has stated that he would act in the best interests of the nation although it might result in his being a one-term president. He now has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put the country back on the right financial course by letting the Bush tax cuts expire. Western civilization will not end on Jan. 1, 2011, if this occurs.
This issue is the defining moment of his presidency, and the president must use this as leverage to create meaningful financial and tax reforms early next year.
The president holds all of the cards through his veto power, yet he is acting as if John Boehner is the president and he is still the junior senator from Illinois.
The nation's daily descent toward a third-world power status dictates immediate action now rather than kicking the can down the road for another two years.
Paul D. Donovan Harvard, Mass., Dec. 5, 2010
To the Editor:
In any other democracy in the world, the Senate vote of 53 to 36 for the House-passed bill to let the Bush tax cuts for the rich lapse would have become law. How can we tolerate a Senate rule that allows a minority to trump the majority? Where are the originalists when we need them?
Nothing in Article I of the Constitution permits this frustration of majority will.
Joyce Appleby Los Angeles, Dec. 5, 2010
The writer is professor emerita of history at U.C.L.A.
To the Editor:
In conclusion: We have a political culture that can send our children to war, thousands to return home in coffins and even more with war-related injuries; but we cannot find the courage to raise taxes to pay for war.
We expect our children to exult in bravery and valor to lose their lives, while we refuse to challenge our economic lifestyle and expectation. Have we finally succumbed to the ultimate in political capitalism?

HEADLINE: Cherry Creek High: Six Seniors Blog About Their College Quest

BYLINE: JACQUES STEINBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Introducing &#8220;Cherry Creek High,&#8221; an ongoing series of first-person blog posts on The Choice by a half dozen college-bound seniors at a Denver public high school. 

 BODY:
Beginning today, The Choice takes flight from its perch here in New York City, arguably the epicenter of the college-admissions-pressure-cooker in the Northeast, and travels across the country to Denver for a much-needed change of scenery. 
There, I have asked six seniors at Cherry Creek High, an idyllic-sounding public school in the small suburb of Greenwood Village, to write an occasional series of first-person essays for this blog about their college application process.
The series makes it debut today - with dispatches from Sophia Gimenez, who is applying to a constellation of women's colleges and seeking substantial financial aid, and Jessica Ray, who dreams of a career as an engineer. Their writings, and those of their classmates, will continue to be featured on The Choice on a regular basis through spring.
Over the next few days, you'll also meet Kori Hazel, a son of divorced parents who likens the college search to nothing less than a prison sentence; Avery DiUbaldo, who is applying to theater programs and has already submitted all of his applications ahead of the Jan. 1 deadline; Michael Campbell, who says he must have missed "the take-it-easy-senior-year-thing" and who describes himself as afraid of rejection; and Uyanga Tamir, a native of Mongolia who is desperately in need of scholarship assistance, but who knows that few schools are "need-blind" in their assessment of international students.
"If I cannot afford the tuition," she writes in her first post, "I simply cannot go."
Collectively, these six young people represent a broad range of the admissions process nationally, not just in their socio-economic backgrounds, but also in the institutions to which they aspire to attend.
Some are applying to state schools, including the University of Colorado at Boulder and Colorado State; others to the Colorado School of Mines; still others to smaller colleges like Knox, Mills and Scripps. Several also aspire to Yale, M.I.T., Stanford, U.S.C. and the University of Pennsylvania, among other highly selective colleges.
A majority of those from Cherry Creek whose writing we will showcase are seeking financial aid - an element of their applications to which many readers of The Choice should relate.
Over all, the counselors at Cherry Creek estimate that nearly two-thirds of the school's more than 800 seniors will seek financial assistance. (Meanwhile, those same counselors estimate that nearly 90 percent of the graduating class will go on to four-year college.)
We hope you will enjoy visiting the living rooms, kitchen tables and guidance conferences of these applicants, at least virtually, as they travel a road whose final destination is far from certain. We thank them, in advance, for being willing to tell their stories.
If you're a parent or an applicant, and would like to use this opening post an opportunity to take stock of where you are in your own college admissions process, please use the comment box below.

HEADLINE: Standing By at $25,000 a Day

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
ABOARD SEAHAWK 2007, Gulf of Mexico -- For the 31 workers on this jackup oil rig, the waiting is finally over.
In recent weeks, they have been doing basic chores like painting handrails and scrubbing the deck while the federal government reviewed Castex Energy's application to drill a natural gas well in 150 feet of water in the Gulf of Mexico -- a normally quick process that turned glacial after the BP oil spill on April 20 prompted regulators to shut down almost all new drilling in the region.
The usual deafening clatter of the driller shack and engine room on the Seahawk 2007 had been replaced by relative silence. After finishing a shift, the men typically went to their cabins instead of playing poker with their buddies, hitting the weight room or watching football in the television room. With no alcohol on board, many of the men had been eating more, Kenneth Milton, a rig cook, told a reporter visiting on Monday. ''Everyone's tensed up, nervous.''
Much of that tension will now ease. On Tuesday, regulators finally granted a drilling permit to Castex, which has a contract with the Seahawk 2007 to drill the well. Over the next few days, the structure will be towed from its current location near Cameron, La., to a drill site off the Texas coast. 
''I'm glad they finally stopped dragging their feet,'' said Gerald Wayne Blanchard, the top supervisor on the rig. ''Now we can get back to work.''
But the long-term prospects for the workers on the Seahawk 2007 -- and their employer, Seahawk Drilling -- remain in doubt.
The workers still have jobs, but many of them are making significantly less than they did before the BP accident. Seahawk Drilling has suffered so much from the slowdown that it is considering selling some rigs -- and maybe the whole company.
''If we get a good offer, we're on the block,'' said Randall D. Stilley, Seahawk's president and chief executive.
That is part of the legacy of the BP disaster, which killed 11 people, spilled millions of barrels of oil, and shook up a regulatory regime that had for years granted drilling permits without much review.
Over the last few weeks, about a quarter of the gulf's 46 shallow water oil rigs were idle, according to Jim Noe, executive director of the Shallow Water Energy Security Coalition and senior vice president at Hercules Offshore. That compares with 5 to 10 percent in normal times, he said. After a flurry of permits were granted in late September and early October, he said, ''we have seen another trickle.''
Although the ban on drilling in the gulf was officially lifted weeks ago, the top regulator for offshore drilling acknowledged Tuesday that permits have been slower in coming as the government stiffened safety requirements and intensified its reviews.
''I feel terrible for the guys on the rig who did nothing wrong,'' Michael R. Bromwich, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement, said in an interview. ''They are victims.''
At the same time, Mr. Bromwich said, ''it would be odd to act as if nothing had happened in April.''
After overhauling its procedures and lifting a six-month-long moratorium, the agency is just now beginning to receive applications for new deepwater wells similar to the BP well. Applications for shallow-water wells, which are considered less risky and were frozen for only a few weeks, have been moving more quickly.
As of Tuesday morning, regulators said, they had approved 12 of the 23 permit applications submitted since June 8 and eight earlier applications that had been revised to meet tougher standards.
Mr. Bromwich said that later this week, his agency would be releasing new guidelines that ''we hope will clarify some of the ambiguities, uncertainties that we have heard about.''
Dale Johnson, a roustabout on the Seahawk 2007, is eager to get back to work.
Early this year, Mr. Johnson bought the home of his dreams in rural Mississippi: a brick house with a big front porch, a lake view, and shade from pine, oak and dogwood trees.
Weeks later, the BP well blew out. As most drilling in the gulf came to a halt, Seahawk Drilling went into a financial tailspin, and Mr. Johnson was demoted from a crane operator position paying $26 an hour to his current role, which pays $17 an hour. Even if drilling restarts, he is unlikely to get his old job, and its higher pay, back soon.
''It was a kick in the stomach,'' said Mr. Johnson, 44. ''I told my wife I feel like a nobody again.''
At Seahawk Drilling, a major shallow-water operator with 20 rigs, only seven rigs have drilling contracts with oil companies. Of those, two are still idle, waiting for their clients to get government permits. Before the BP accident, nine rigs were working, but in the summer, that number fell to as low as two. While things are picking up, top executives say they could be back down to only a handful of working rigs in January if permit approvals do not pick up.
''We're in permitorium,'' said Mr. Stilley, Seahawk's president and chief executive.
Seahawk says that each manned rig costs $25,000 a day to operate whether it is earning money or not. All told, the company lost $74 million over the first nine months of the year, and it has laid off 350 of its 900 workers.
Across the industry, a couple of thousand of oil workers have lost their jobs -- a lesser toll than once predicted but still painful.
To make matters worse for unemployed shallow-water rig workers, they are ineligible to seek compensation from BP's two relief funds because they did not technically suffer from the moratorium on deepwater drilling.
''They are in Catch-22,'' said Kenneth R. Feinberg, administrator of the Gulf Coast Claims Facility.
As they looked out from their vessel on Monday, the workers on the Seahawk 2007 saw several other mothballed company rigs with skeleton crews aboard parked in a no-man's-land they call ''the bone yard.''
The Seahawk 2007, an older rig built in the 1980s, has been underemployed since the BP accident. From April to December, the rig would have normally drilled six new wells, according to Mr. Blanchard. But since the spill, it has not drilled any new wells and was permitted only to modify three existing wells.
Things appeared to be looking up in mid-November when the rig was leased by Castex Energy, a small, privately held oil and gas company, as Castex anticipated approval to drill a new gas well. But federal regulators sent back the application several times for a variety of modifications.
Kenneth Cunningham, a 40-year-old derrick man, a senior member of the crew who manages the flow of liquids through the well bore, said Monday that workers have been living day to day. ''It's misery not knowing what tomorrow brings.''
Now he knows.
But Kurt Hoffman, the senior vice president and chief operating officer for Seahawk Drilling, said Tuesday evening that the relief might not last.
''I think it's great, but I don't see anything sustainable,'' he said. ''We have just been advised by one of our other rigs that it may be another two weeks before the federal government issues a permit. It's already been waiting a week and a half. That's long when you are paying $25,000 a day to keep the rig on standby.''

HEADLINE: Still Digging

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Given where we are, this tax-cut deal with the Republicans is the best President Obama could do since raising taxes in a recession would not have been a good idea and the Republicans had the votes to prevent it. But given where we need to go, this deal is just another shot of morphine to a country that needs to do things that are big and hard and still only wants to do things that are easy and small. It still feels to me as though we're splitting the difference between the two parties, not making a difference for the country as a whole.
More than ever, America today reminds me of a working couple where the husband has just lost his job, they have two kids in junior high school, a mortgage and they're maxed out on their credit cards. On top of it all, they recently agreed to take in their troubled cousin, Kabul, who just can't get his act together and keeps bouncing from relative to relative. Meanwhile, their Indian nanny, who traded room and board for baby-sitting, just got accepted to M.I.T. on a full scholarship and will be leaving them in a few months. What to do? 
One strategy would be to hunker down, don't spend a dime on anything other than food, the mortgage and paying off their credit card debts. They would get by, but there's not much future in it. Another strategy would be to borrow against their life insurance policies to make up for the loss of income, keep living like they're living, and hope that the husband's job comes back before his unemployment checks run out.
A third strategy -- the right one -- would be to tell themselves: ''You know, we're in a totally new situation. Dad's job isn't coming back. If we want a better future, we need a plan to cut, save and invest all at the same time, and as wisely as we possibly can, because we've got no more cushion. Instead of Disney World this year, we'll go camping in the state park and use those savings so that dad can go back and get a master's degree. After all, unemployment among the college-educated is only around 5 percent. We're also going to give up buying any new gadgets, cellphone apps or video games and use those savings to pay for extra tutoring in physics and violin for our boys. And, finally, we're going to tell cousin Kabul that he needs to get a job, move into his own place and stand on his own two feet.''
Like our mythical family, we need a plan, not just more sugar treats. Surely the cynical quote of the week -- courtesy of The Daily Beast -- goes to Dan Bartlett, the former George W. Bush administration spokesman who was speaking about the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that Bush ''temporarily'' put in place a decade ago: ''We knew that, politically, once you get it into law, it becomes almost impossible to remove it. That's not a bad legacy. The fact that we were able to lay the trap does feel pretty good, to tell you the truth.''
Bartlett offered no thoughts as to how these budget-busting tax cuts will address our country's deficiencies today -- just a high-five that in the politics of sports, the G.O.P. just scored a goal on Obama.
We don't seem to realize: We're in a hole and still digging. Our educational attainment levels are stagnating; our infrastructure is fraying. We don't have enough smart incentives to foster both innovation and manufacturing; we're not importing enough talent in an age when we have to compete for jobs with low-wage but high-skilled Indians and Chinese -- and we're still piling up debt. Responding to all this will require a whole new hybrid politics for where to cut, where to save, where to invest, where to tax and where to untax. Shaping that new politics is a revolutionary role I still hope President Obama will play.
E.J. Dionne Jr., in his Washington Post column, quoted Representative Tom Perriello, a Democrat of Virginia, as saying that voters are less interested in ''bipartisanship'' than ''postpartisanship.'' He explained: ''What they're looking for is someone who solves the problem, not for a solution that happens to be halfway between the two parties.''
Read Tuesday's article in this paper about how international education experts were stunned by the fact that students in Shanghai outscored their counterparts in dozens of other countries, in reading as well as in math and science, according to the results of the widely respected Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, tests, which measure learning by 15-year-old students in 65 countries. Yes, Shanghai represents the best of China, but the best of China is now scoring better than anywhere else in the world. America's 15-year-olds ranked 14th in reading skills, 17th in science and 25th in math, below the average.
Economics is not war. It can be win-win, so it's good for the world if China is doing better. But it can't be good for America if every time we come to a hard choice we borrow more money from a country that is not just out-saving and out-hustling us, but is also starting to out-educate us. We need a plan.

HEADLINE: Voting for an Odious Tax Deal

 BODY:
Liberal Democrats are in revolt at the tax deal that President Obama struck with Republicans on Monday, and it is not hard to understand why. By temporarily extending income tax breaks for the richest Americans, and cutting estate taxes for the ultrawealthy, the deal will redistribute billions of dollars from job creation to people who do not need the money.
But the Democrats should vote for this deal, because it is the only one they are going to get. Mr. Obama made that case -- strongly -- on Tuesday, summoning an eloquence that is often elusive, as it was on Monday when he first announced the deal. Without this bargain, income taxes on the middle class would rise. Unemployment insurance for millions of Americans would expire. And many other important tax breaks for low- and middle-income workers -- including a 2 percent payroll tax cut and college tuition credits -- would not be possible. 
If angry Democrats blow up the deal, they will be left vainly groping for something better in a new Congress where they will have far less influence than they have now. The middle class and the unemployed would be seriously hurt.
The president, and particularly Congressional Democrats, might not be in this bind if they had fought harder against the high-end tax cuts before the midterm elections. But that moment has passed. The real responsibility for what's wrong with the tax deal lies with Republicans. They coldly insisted on the high-end tax cuts at all costs, no matter the pain they might inflict further down the income ladder or what staggering cost they might impose in years to come.
President Obama was right to use the metaphor of hostage-taking to describe the Republicans' tactics. Using the parliamentary rules of the Senate, 42 Republican senators threatened to raise middle-class taxes if Democrats let tax cuts expire on the richest 2 percent of Americans. That left the White House and the Democrats little room to maneuver. ''I think it's tempting not to negotiate with hostage-takers, unless the hostage gets harmed,'' Mr. Obama said at his news conference on Tuesday.
Some of the provisions won by the president could act as a new stimulus to the economy, particularly the extension of the unemployment benefits for 13 months and the cut to the payroll tax, though the full stimulative effect is uncertain. The cut only applies to wages and salaries up to $106,800 -- people who really need it.
There remains much to dislike in the package, including the pressure that its deficit spending will create to cut important programs in the years to come. Mr. Obama was clearly not thrilled at the compromises he had to make, and neither are we. But at least he acted in what he believed are the best interests of the country.
When are the Republicans going to step up and do the same? There is no legitimate national interest in opposing the New Start nuclear arms treaty with the Russians, which most military and foreign leaders agree would make the world a safer place. There is no legitimate national interest in clinging to the discrimination against gay members of the military, which the Pentagon's leaders want to end. There will be no sound economic reason to make the tax cuts for the top 2 percent of taxpayers permanent in two years.
The only reason for Republican recalcitrance on these issues is to deny the Democrats an accomplishment, to stymie Mr. Obama's re-election and appeal to the most retrograde elements of the party's base.
President Obama will face a liberal whirlwind for the compromise he made on taxes. It is time for Republicans to show that they are strong enough to take on their base for their country's benefit.

HEADLINE: Obama Defends Tax Deal, But His Party Stays Hostile

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Tuesday strongly defended his tax cut deal with Congressional Republicans against intense criticism from his own party, insisting it was ''a good deal for the American people.''
Struggling to ensure that the package would win approval, the White House deployed Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to Capitol Hill in a bid to allay the concerns of Senate Democrats. Mr. Obama also held a news conference where, with uncharacteristic emotion, he suggested that liberals were unrealistic about what they could achieve in Washington and also slammed Republicans, at one point comparing them to hostage-takers.
''I've said before that I felt that the middle-class tax cuts were being held hostage to the high-end tax cuts,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I think it's tempting not to negotiate with hostage-takers, unless the hostage gets harmed. Then people will question the wisdom of that strategy. In this case, the hostage was the American people, and I was not willing to see them get harmed.'' 
But at the Capitol, Mr. Biden failed to convince many of his old Senate colleagues to line up behind the plan at a tense lunch meeting. In his pitch for support, he called it ''a bad situation'' but ''a good deal,'' participants said.
While many Democrats in the Senate and House raged against the idea of continuing George W. Bush's tax policies for two more years -- and some voiced serious concerns about adding the $900 billion cost to the deficit -- the package seemed likely to win approval provided that Republicans vote for it in big numbers, as party leaders predicted they would.
Even with unanimous Republican support, which is not assured, at least 18 Senate Democrats would need to support the package to overcome a potential filibuster. About a dozen Senate Democrats have voiced a willingness to temporarily extend all of the Bush-era tax rates, given the weak economy. Aides said about 30 were firmly opposed, leaving 16 or so undecided.
Mr. Biden, who personally negotiated the deal with the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnnell of Kentucky, used the lunch meeting to emphasize provisions the White House had won, including a one-year payroll tax cut for all workers, a 13-month extension of jobless aid for the long-term unemployed and other steps to help lift the still-struggling economy.
But even the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, expressed unhappiness with the deal and said changes were needed. ''This is only a framework,'' Mr. Reid said. ''It's up to the Congress to pass it. Some in my caucus still have concerns.''
The anger was rawer in the House, where Democrats met on Tuesday evening to discuss the proposal. ''I don't think the president should count on Democratic votes to get this deal passed,'' said Representative Anthony Weiner, Democrat of New York.
Emerging from the meeting, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who has refused to commit her support, said only that ''there's unease'' in the caucus.
But in the unlikely event that Democrats vote down the package, the incoming Republican majority would presumably approve it in January -- perhaps after extracting further concessions from the White House.
Mr. McConnell described the accord as ''essentially final'' and predicted that the vast majority of Republicans would vote for it.
At the White House, Mr. Obama's long-simmering frustration with his party's liberal wing seemed to boil over as he implored Democrats not to make the perfect the enemy of the good. Facing questions about his ''core principles,'' Mr. Obama referred to the health care debate, in which liberals accused him of abandoning Democratic ideals when he gave up on a government-backed ''public option'' health care plan.
''This is the public-option debate all over again,'' Mr. Obama complained, adding: ''Now, if that's the standard by which we are measuring success or core principles, then, let's face it, we will never get anything done. People will have the satisfaction of having a purist position and no victories for the American people. And we will be able to feel good about ourselves and sanctimonious about how pure our intentions are and how tough we are, and in the meantime, the American people are still seeing themselves not able to get health insurance because of pre-existing condition, or not being able to pay their bills because their unemployment insurance ran out.''
Mr. Obama said he was taking a long view. ''My job is to make sure that we have a North Star out there,'' he said. ''What is helping the American people live out their lives?''
Inside the White House, top advisers to the president emphasized that, in extracting concessions from Republicans on unemployment benefits and other tax cuts for the middle class, the administration had hardly given away the store. ''This agreement greatly exceeds what anyone believed we could get,'' one senior official said.
But at the Capitol some Senate Democrats said it was difficult to make sense of Mr. Biden's sales pitch, other than to describe it as the best deal the White House could muster.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, paused for eight seconds when asked what Mr. Biden's main argument was in favor of the plan.
''I am really not sure what his main argument was,'' Mrs. Feinstein said.
She added, ''We have got this huge debt and deficit. We know it. This adds a trillion dollars to it. It's a problem.''
Mrs. Feinstein said she might be persuaded to support the plan if she concluded that it would spur economic growth, an argument that Gene Sperling, counselor to the Treasury secretary, made to senators at the lunch.
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, said he was not swayed by Mr. Biden. ''I don't think it's a fair deal,'' Mr. Lautenberg said. ''I think a ransom was paid, and it was a very high price.''
Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, complained about the ''nonsensicalness'' of continuing lower tax rates for the wealthy. Ms. Landrieu was one of only a handful of Democrats to support the original Bush tax cuts in 2001.
Democrats expressed particular displeasure with an agreement on the federal estate tax, which would set an exemption of $5 million per individual and a maximum rate of 35 percent for two years. The estate tax lapsed entirely this year, but is due to return on Jan. 1 with an exemption of $1 million and maximum rate of 55 percent.
Some Democrats, particularly centrists, said they would support the proposal. ''The entire package is necessary to strengthen economic growth for next year,'' said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota. ''The president did about what he had to do. And he deserves credit for that.''
Still, Mr. Conrad said he did not like the estate tax proposal.
While many Republicans said they liked the deal, Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, said that he still wanted the Bush-era rates extended permanently and that the cost of the package was worrisome. ''There is a lot of pause right now,'' Mr. DeMint said, noting that he had not decided how to vote.
Mr. Obama's news conference was intended, officials said, to let him make the public case for the package while Mr. Biden worked Capitol Hill.
But officials did not rule out the possibility that Mr. Obama would have to step in and do some lobbying of his own.
At his news conference, Mr. Obama said he looked forward to future battles with Republicans.
''I've got a whole bunch of lines in the sand,'' he insisted, adding: ''Take a tally -- look at what I promised during the campaign. There's not a single thing that I have said that I would do that I have not done or tried to do. And if I haven't gotten it done yet, I'm still trying.''

HEADLINE: In Tax Plan, A Boost For Jobs

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
A year ago, President Obama and the Democrats made the mistake of assuming that an economic recovery was under way. This week's deal to extend the Bush tax cuts shows that the White House's top priority is avoiding the same mistake again -- even if it has to upset many fellow Democrats in the process.
Mr. Obama effectively traded tax cuts for the affluent, which Republicans were demanding, for a second stimulus bill that seemed improbable a few weeks ago. Mr. Obama yielded to Republicans on extending the high-end Bush tax cuts and on cutting the estate tax below its scheduled level. In exchange, Republicans agreed to extend unemployment benefits, cut payroll taxes and business taxes, and extend a grab bag of tax credits for college tuition and other items. 
For the White House, the deal represents a clear shift in policy focus. Mr. Obama and Democrats spent much of the last year pursuing long-term goals like a health care overhaul and financial regulation, while hoping the economic recovery would continue. But with the recovery faltering and Republicans retaking the House, the administration is turning back to short-term job creation.
Congressional Democrats have reacted with a mix of wariness and anger, and some said Mr. Obama should have put up a fight on the high-end tax cuts. Yet once the Democrats bungled this issue -- failing to deal with it before the midterm elections -- their choices were extremely limited. If they stood firm on the high-end tax cuts and Republicans stood firm as well, all of the Bush tax cuts, not just those on income above $250,000, would have expired Dec. 31. The economy would surely have suffered as a result, and a bad economy is rarely good for the party that holds the White House.
Tellingly, economists and Democratic policy experts were largely pleased with the deal. Forecasting firms on Tuesday upgraded their estimates for growth and job gains over the next two years. Economists at Goldman Sachs, who have been more negative and more accurate than most Wall Street forecasters lately, called the deal ''significantly more positive'' than they had anticipated.
And left-leaning policy experts said the package did more to create jobs than they had thought possible after the Republicans' midterm election victories. Robert Greenstein, Lawrence Mishel and John Podesta -- who run prominent Washington research groups that range from liberal to staunchly liberal -- all offered praise for the package. Of its estimated $900 billion-plus cost over two years, roughly $120 billion covers the high-end tax cuts and the estate tax cut, $450 billion covers Mr. Obama's wish list and $360 billion covers the tax cut extensions both parties favored.
''People are kind of venting their disappointment and acting as if the administration did a terrible job in the negotiations,'' said Mr. Greenstein, who runs the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ''But it didn't. The mistake the administration made -- and it was a serious one -- was that it should have dealt with this well before the election.''
Still, the risk for Democrats, and the economy, remains the same as it was. Financial crises wreak terrible havoc. They typically cause unemployment to rise for more than five years and leave consumers and business uncertain about when healthy growth will finally resume. Aftershocks are common, as is evident in Europe. Virtually no economist believes the new stimulus package will be big enough to make the economy feel healthy anytime soon.
The ideal package would have been larger than the current one, and it would have been better tailored. The $120 billion cut in the payroll tax, for example, will apply to the portion paid by workers, not companies. The Congressional Budget Office and other analysts have said that cutting the workers' portion provides less bang for the buck because individuals are likely to save some portion of the money. Cutting the employers' portion subsidizes hiring.
But politics prevented the best kind of payroll tax cut. Republicans did not want one larger than the $120 billion, one-year cut in the package. Administration officials wanted the political benefit of having that whole sum apply to individual workers. The resulting compromise will help the economy, but not as much as it could have.
Initial estimates by economists suggested that the overall legislation would reduce the unemployment rate by one-half a percentage point to a full point over the next year, compared with allowing all the tax cuts to expire and passing no new stimulus. By the end of 2012, the decline could be up to 1.5 percentage points, economists said.
On the other hand, the unemployment rate will still probably be near 8 percent by the end of 2012, when the current package expires, and the two parties will get to have this fight all over again.
What's the early line on that fight? Republican officials hope that Democrats will again find it hard to let all the tax cuts expire in the name of letting some expire. White House officials hope the economy will have improved enough by then to help Mr. Obama win re-election -- and to allow him to threaten, credibly, to veto any bill that includes a tax cut for the wealthy.
There is also one big unknown looming over the whole debate: the deficit. This week's deal, of course, will worsen the deficit. In the short run, many economists believe a larger deficit is better than the alternative. As Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said during a recent ''60 Minutes'' interview, ''We don't want to take actions this year that will affect this year's spending and this year's taxes in a way that will hurt the recovery.''
Yet Mr. Bernanke and other economists usually add another point. Any additional spending now, they say, should be paired with future deficit reduction. Otherwise, the long-term deficit will continue to rise, and nervous investors may eventually demand that the federal government pay higher interest rates. Interest rates remain low for now, but they did rise on Tuesday, after the compromise was announced.
The problem is that raising the deficit -- be it through high-end tax cuts or a new stimulus program -- is a lot easier than cutting it. Strange as it may sound, some of the only fiscal conservatives in Washington this week have been liberals who would be willing to let everyone's taxes rise. And they seem unlikely to win on this issue.

HEADLINE: DEALBOOK ONLINE; UNPAID DEBTS

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve has a story and is sticking to it: We didn't lose taxpayer money, and we won't.
But several emergency programs and credit lines still exist, and the path to profitability on them remains uncertain.
Hedge funds, pension funds and other investors have some $25 billion in outstanding loans from the Fed, some backed by subprime consumer debt. The central bank's books are stocked with $66 billion of securities related to Bear Stearns and the American International Group, and the troubled insurer also owes $20 billion on a Fed credit line. 
''You certainly can envision scenarios where all that money isn't coming back,'' said Dean Baker, an economist who leads the Center for Economic and Policy Research, based in Washington.
As the financial crisis has receded, the Fed has been quick to point out that it hasn't lost money on its efforts.
''We took an enormous amount of risk with the people's money,'' Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said in a recent speech. But ''we didn't lose a dime, and in fact we made money on every one of them.''
Time will tell on what remains.
One of the Fed's crucial lending programs, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, does not expire until 2015. The program provided cheap financing to hedge funds, mutual funds and other big investors as part of an effort to jump-start consumer lending. So far, investors have repaid about two-thirds of their loans early, and along the way, the Fed has turned a profit from interest and fees.
But another $25 billion remains outstanding, according to the Fed's weekly statistical release.
While borrowers have pledged plenty of collateral, some of those securities look better than others. As DealBook wrote on Friday, at least $2.5 billion of the collateral is backed by subprime credit card debt issued by Citigroup and GE Capital. Citigroup has lost billions on its credit card business, and it is trying to offload the subprime portfolio.
The Fed is also on the hook for costs related to JPMorgan Chase's buyout of Bear Stearns in March 2008. To help facilitate the deal, the central bank agreed to buy $29 billion of Bear's mortgage-related securities through a vehicle named Maiden Lane. After selling some assets, the portfolio, which includes commercial real estate loans for airports and hotels, now amounts to $27.5 billion. The Fed created Maiden Lane II and III to purchase many of the troubled investments that A.I.G. insured. Many have considered the two vehicles, which allowed Goldman Sachs and big European banks to offload bad assets, a trash receptacle for the financial industry. Both entities, according to the Fed, have increased in value.
A.I.G., meanwhile, owes the Fed about $20 billion on a credit line. To pay off the loan, the insurer plans to sell assets and tap into a lending facility from the Treasury.
The Fed remains confident that its programs will pay off -- or at least remain in the black.
''The Federal Reserve followed sound risk-management practices in administering all of these programs, incurred no credit losses on programs that have been wound down, and expects to incur no credit losses on the few remaining programs,'' the central bank said in the statement last week.
What if the Fed ends up out a few bucks?
Some say it would be the necessary price to have avoided disaster.
''The Fed did get involved in unprecedented activities and did expose taxpayers to some risk, but the benefit was huge,'' said Frederic Mishkin, the Alfred Lerner professor of banking and financial institutions at Columbia Business School. ''The Fed helped avert a possible second Great Depression.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Natural Gas Drilling

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Breaking Away From Coal'' (Business Day, Nov. 30) highlights technological advancements that provide access to more United States natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil. 
So it's disappointing that New York lawmakers acted to forgo considerable economic and clean energy advantages by passing a natural gas drilling ban.
It's a myth that to safeguard the environment we must stop economic opportunity. Natural gas is routinely produced safely, and it emits half the carbon of coal and virtually no mercury, sulfur dioxide or particulate pollution. Its development creates hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs and is breathing economic life into communities across America.
Now none of those jobs will be in New York. The state will send its energy dollars to Pennsylvania. New York was a net importer of 95 percent of its natural gas. Now it will import 100 percent. Too bad.

HEADLINE: Sprawling Development in Stamford Is Filling Out

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP

 BODY:
STAMFORD, Conn. -- When the sprawling, mixed-use Harbor Point project in this city's South End changed hands in September 2008, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to the 80-acre site, one of the largest and most ambitious redevelopment efforts in the country.
At the time, Harbor Point's new and more experienced owner, Building and Land Technology of Norwalk, Conn., said it planned to keep the $3.5 billion project going as a major part of the revival of the 322-acre peninsula south of Interstate 95, which was once largely industrial. 
Still, the ownership of Harbor Point changed hands just as many development projects, battered by the economy, were being shelved. And in the exchange, Building and Land Technology inherited an assortment of properties -- old factories, modern office towers, a boatyard and vacant land -- scattered across the peninsula, complicating plans for a cohesive development. Those properties had been assembled, starting in 2005, by Harbor Point's original developer, Antares Investment Partners of Greenwich, Conn.
Two years later, Harbor Point has two new residential towers, two new Class A office buildings and a large retail anchor store, an 85,000-square-foot Fairway Market that opened on Nov. 3. Walls are going up as well for the Waterside School, an independent school that serves lower-income families. And while leasing at the office towers remains fitful, brokers say momentum is picking up.
The long-term plan for Harbor Point is still for a transit-oriented community that would have some two million square feet of space for a range of office and retail tenants, 4,000 units of housing, restaurants, a full-service marina, new parkland and a public river walk along the Mill River on the western side of the development. So far, residential development has been a surprising area of strength at Harbor Point.
''The rental market has exceeded our expectations,'' said Carl R. Kuehner III, the president and chief executive at Building and Land Technology.
Mr. Kuehner said leases had been signed for more than 210 of the apartments at the 225-unit Lofts at Yale & Towne complex that opened in May, on property that once was part of the Yale lock factory. He also said the company had leased about 20 percent of the 336 apartments at 101 Park Place, a tower that opened in October on the western side of Harbor Point.
Because of the strong rental market, Building and Land Technology is now proceeding with plans for an additional 329 apartments near both the loft building and the new Fairway.
On the office market side, the hospitality company Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, based in White Plains, will move next December to some 270,000 square feet of space at the Stamford Harbor Park office complex.
Starwood's decision did not come lightly: it took three years of negotiations and a hefty package of financial incentives from the state of Connecticut to cinch the deal. Still, since Starwood agreed to move, two other commercial tenants have signed on nearby.
One of them is the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University, which is building a large specialty and emergency care center at a site between Starwood's new headquarters and the new Fairway. Design Within Reach, the modern goods retailer based in San Francisco, is coming to the area as well. In October the company announced plans to move its corporate headquarters to Harbor Point and open a large retail store in another old Yale lock building.
Design Within Reach is heading to a part of Harbor Point where antique and furniture retailers have already leased an estimated 150,000 square feet of warehouse and retail space over the last 14 years, said David Johnson, the president of the Connecticut Antiques Center on Canal Street on the peninsula.
''We think the area is going to turn into a design district,'' said John Edelman, the president and chief executive of Design Within Reach, and a resident of Ridgefield, Conn.
So far, only two leases have been signed for the two new office towers at Harbor Point, known as One and Two Harbor Point Square. Together, they are expected to offer more than 400,000 square feet of Class A office space.
McKinsey & Company, the management consulting company based in Manhattan, signed a lease last summer for 24,000 square feet at Two Harbor Point Square, and Louis Dreyfus Highbridge Energy, an energy merchant based in Wilton, Conn., signed a lease in October for the top two floors at One Harbor Point Square.
Real estate executives say leasing at the office towers has been slow both because the buildings are just finishing construction, and because asking rents are about 20 percent more than what similar space might fetch in downtown Stamford, where the Class A office space vacancy rate is 16.7 percent, according to Newmark Knight Frank, the real estate services company.
Traffic congestion and narrow roads are still issues in the South End. But real estate executives say some prospective tenants are more willing to look in the area because of improvements like the widening and repaving of Canal Street.
''A lot of the interest in Harbor Point is being driven by the ability it now gives for company employees to more easily get to work,'' said John D. Goodkind, the managing director of the Westchester-Connecticut office of Newmark Knight Frank.
One of the drawbacks to Harbor Point has been a lack of integration of the commercial, residential and transportation components. A new complex called Gateway is trying to address that issue. The project, on a six-acre site next to the Stamford train and transportation center, is to include new housing, 474,000 square feet of office space and nearly 1,800 below-street parking sites. It would both expand Harbor Point's footprint and make it almost instantly visible to train riders.
Mr. Kuehner said his company planned to spend an additional $73 million in infrastructure improvements at Harbor Point, for example on walking trails, parkland and more waterfront access.
''The initial challenge we faced with Harbor Point was how to create a sense of place with multiple product types,'' he said. But now, he said, ''it's becoming a neighborhood.''

HEADLINE: A Source of Comfort on Capitol Hill

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
AS Congress passed a law last week that would stuff more fruits and vegetables into school lunches, several blocks away the people lined up for hot dogs. The choices were many: all beef with peppers and onions; a deep-fried Angus number; one wrapped in a pretzel roll, topped with Cheez Whiz.
The dog doings were at DC-3, a new aviation-themed hot dog spot that takes its place among many high-end junk-food purveyors that have popped up around Capitol Hill recently. Over at the White House, a farmers' market has sprouted, a garden has been cultivated and holiday guests are being offered poached fruit. But the area surrounding the Capitol is awash in milkshakes, grilled cheese sandwiches and mildly baroque pizza.
Leading the charge is the Matchbox Food Group, DC-3's parent company, which began with a pizza joint in nearby Chinatown and has recently opened a sister ''pizza bistro'' on Eighth Street, along with Ted's Bulletin, a midprice comfort-food outpost. 
On H Street, the other side of the Capitol, Liberty Tree is serving pigs in blankets, macaroni and cheese and fried clam sandwiches. On the pizza front, in addition to Matchbox, there is We, The Pizza, dished out by ''Top Chef'' graduate Spike Mendelsohn, and Seventh Hill Pizza, a new spot near Eastern Market.
Very little that occurs inside the Beltway is a genuine allegory for national passions, but the proliferation of food that is affordable, nostalgic and deeply accessible may be about as close as it gets.
Mr. Mendelsohn has worked with Michelle Obama extensively on her anti-obesity campaign. But that didn't stop him from starting a Capitol Hill-area burger spot, Good Stuff Eatery, and We, The Pizza, which opened four months ago.
A major contributor to the spread of Everyman Eating is the steady rise of Capitol Hill as a residential neighborhood, with several chefs moving into the area. When they open restaurants, what they want, it seems, is not a crack at a Michelin star, but rather midlevel places where they could get food from their childhood, and attract residents who craved the same.
''The idea that created this was: 'Where do we want to eat? What do we like to eat?' And let's put it in our neighborhood,'' said Micheline Mendelsohn, Spike's sister and an owner of his ventures.
They have company. ''A lot of the neighbors thanked us up and down for investing here,'' said Ty Neal, one of four partners in Matchbox Food Group, two of whom live in the neighborhood.
Their first venture, Matchbox Pizza, opened in 2003 in nearby Chinatown, and ''there were hookers and gunshots when we arrived,'' he said.
''But we had an idea of what was coming, and our landlord said this was going to be the next hot neighborhood,'' Mr. Neal said. In 2005, when that vision became true, the group started thinking expansion. After a side stop in Palm Springs, Calif., in 2007, ''we signed a lease on Capitol Hill with the same idea.''
The pizza place was an instant hit. Next came Ted's Bulletin, an ode to his father, Mr. Neal said, and then the airplane-shaped hot dog place.
The new places around the Capitol also represent, if not an emergent dining scene, at least a steadily improving one in a city long derided for substandard eating. A number of New York chefs have decamped to the area, realizing that a permanent industry means an economy that has fewer dents than that of many other big cities. They follow trailblazers like Jose Andres, the Spanish chef, who has long been on the forefront of bringing more innovative fare to Washington with places like Jaleo and Zaytinya.
''It's true that D.C. is now a city you have to be in,'' said Jimmy Haber, managing partner of BLT Restaurant Group, which operates 20 restaurants in a dozen cities. ''You've heard that government is not getting any smaller, and big government certainly helps business.'' Mr. Haber said that his company's BLT Steak and Casa Nonna restaurants here perform almost as well as their counterparts in New York.
Next year Fabio Trabocchi, formerly of the Four Seasons and Fiamma in New York, is returning to Washington, where he first gained recognition for his intricate Italian preparations. He is an exception, though. In general, the great middle seems the safest bet here. In coming months, Bobby Flay is opening a burger place and Danny Meyer is adding a Shake Shack. ''We don't have esoteric restaurants'' in Washington, said Mr. Haber, who hopes to open a burger place, too.
Well, there is nothing esoteric about a hot dog, nor do servers at most burger joints deliver lectures about the provenance of the ingredients. (''For the Gut Buster, Chef likes to use cheese food, locally sourced from Giant supermarket, aged for two months in its nonrecyclable receptacle.'')
Mr. Neal said that for DC-3, his group studied the regional dogs of the nation, then interpreted them. The most successful take is the Chicago 7, a Vienna all-beef smothered in peppers, relish and onions: ''The reason you eat a hot dog,'' said my colleague, Carl, whose favorite meal generally consists of something from a sad canteen at the bottom of the Capitol building.
The signature dish at Ted's Bulletin is unadorned tomato soup with grilled cheese, the sort of meal your mom made when you came from school to veg out in front of ''Guiding Light,'' back in the days when parents did not pester you about joining the chess club instead.
The milkshakes are thick and properly taste like dairy, not candy. You can get them with alcohol, too. I tip my hat to the country fried steak, which so often offers a layer of grease masquerading as batter, and the elevated ''pop tarts,'' which are silly, but weirdly alluring.
Liberty Tree, which opened in March, takes advantage of this city's minor obsession with constitutional high-mindedness, with artwork depiction American Revolutionaries.
There are white tablecloths here. And, yes, a pork chop and the like. But the draw is pigs in a blanket (made with Portuguese sausage), deviled eggs dabbed with bacon and brussels spouts that provide a closed case on why frying makes anything delicious. Downed with one of the many beers, a special of mac and cheese with lobster was less cliche than bread-crumb-spackled heaven.
It will probably not win a spot on the White House nightly menu. ''I wouldn't say you should eat comfort food seven days a week,'' said Scott Hamilton, the owner of Liberty Tree. ''I think you have to mix it up, and I do.''
So, apparently, does the president. On a recent trip to Kokomo, Ind., he loaded up on pumpkin rolls, cinnamon rolls, apple fritters and doughnuts at a local bakery. Maybe he didn't know there were Pop Tarts in his own town.
Recipe: Tomato Soup
Adapted from Ted's Bulletin, Washington
Time: 1 hour
1/2 pound butter
1 pound onions (about 3 medium), cut into 1/4-inch dice
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
4 28-ounce cans diced tomatoes
1 1/4 cups chicken broth
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon celery salt
3/4 teaspoon pepper
3/4 cup half-and-half
2 tablespoons honey.
1. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add onions and cook gently, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, about 20 minutes.
2. Add flour and stir until mixture is slightly thickened and pale gold, about 3 minutes; do not allow to brown.
3. Stir in the tomatoes and their juices, chicken broth, sugar, salt, celery salt and pepper. Raise heat to medium until the liquid bubbles, then reduce heat to low. Simmer for 30 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pot frequently.
4. Stir in half-and-half and honey. Remove from heat and puree using a hand blender, or allow to cool until no longer steaming and puree in batches in a stand blender. Return to medium heat just until heated through. Serve hot.
Yield: 8 servings.

HEADLINE: Colleges See 16% Increase In Study of Sign Language

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
While the number of college students studying Spanish, French and German increased only modestly from 2006 to 2009, enrollment in American Sign Language -- the fourth most-popular language -- surged more than 16 percent, according to a new report from the Modern Language Association.
Sign-language professors suggested various reasons for the rise. They said it reflected the growing acceptance of American Sign Language to meet college foreign-language requirements, and its usefulness as an employment credential -- not only for interpreters, but also for cognitive psychologists, educators, nurses and even scuba divers. 
With the deep budget cuts of the recession, some universities have cut back their language programs. Even so, enrollment in foreign-language classes grew 6.6 percent from 2006 to 2009 -- compared with 12.9 percent from 2002 to 2006 -- according to the report, ''Enrollments in Languages Other Than English in United States Institutions of Higher Education, Fall 2009.''
''This is a vulnerable time for language study,'' said Rosemary Feal, executive director of the Modern Language Association. ''But student interest remains strong.''
Foreign-language enrollment in 2009 was 1,682,627, an all-time high. But language courses accounted for 8.6 percent of college classes, the same as in 2006. In 1965, the percentage was 16.5.
And while undergraduate language study increased, especially at two-year institutions, graduate-school foreign-language enrollment declined 6.7 percent from 2006 to 2009.
As in past years, Spanish accounted for more than half of all foreign-language study.
A few languages with clear geopolitical importance had larger increases than American Sign Language: Arabic, the fastest growing, was up 46 percent, Korean 19 percent and Chinese 18 percent.
After long debate about whether American Sign Language is a real language -- and whether it qualifies as a foreign language -- a few universities now offer a major or minor in it, and many more accept sign language for their foreign-language requirement.
More than 90,000 students enrolled in sign-language classes last year, compared with only 4,304 in 1995.
Many colleges have long waiting lists of students trying to get into introductory A.S.L. classes, a substantial share of them turning to sign language because of their previous difficulties learning European languages.
''Some students take it because when they took Spanish or French in high school, it was horrific and they think this will be better,'' said Amy Ruth McGraw, who teaches at the University of Iowa, where about 200 students study sign language. ''And if their problem was auditory, or the accent, this might be better. But if it was memorizing vocabulary and grammar, this isn't going to be any better.''
According to the Modern Language Association, only about half the nation's colleges now include foreign-language study as a requirement for graduation, down from about two-thirds 15 years ago.
At the University of Rochester, where the language requirement has been dropped, sign-language enrollment has remained strong.
''A.S.L. is our second-largest language,'' said Ted Supalla, director of Rochester's A.S.L. program. ''It gets almost 10 percent of our undergraduates, almost equal to Spanish.''
It does not hurt that, in a time of high unemployment, the job market for sign-language interpreters is strong.
''The demand for nationally certified A.S.L. interpreters is huge, and as a freelance interpreter, you can make $40 to $60 an hour,'' said Dennis Cokely, director of the A.S.L. program at Northeastern University.
Many students say their interest in sign language is more about the allure of communicating without spoken words.
''My generation has grown up seeing American Sign Language in television shows and movies, and it just looks so cool,'' said Anne Dunn, a junior at the University of Vermont. ''I started because we have a language requirement here. But sign language is so visual, so exciting, that I got hooked and kept going.''
Ms. Dunn said she and others were trying to persuade the university to let them minor in American Sign Language.
Many students take aesthetic pleasure in sign language. Emily Brown, a sign-language student at Wesleyan University, talks excitedly about watching deaf poetry on YouTube, and ''rhyming'' words like ''stars'' and ''socks,'' whose signs share a hand shape and motion.
''I imagine myself painting pictures in the air,'' said Ms. Brown, a junior majoring in English, and serving as an A.S.L. teaching assistant. ''It feels more poetic than other languages. It's such a great way to express things you can't quite express verbally.''

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths ROSS, HOWARD, PH.D.

 BODY:
ROSS--Howard, Ph.D.,Professor of Economics and Finance at Baruch College, died on November 16 in New York City of complications from pneumonia. Professor Ross began his career in 1954 as a lecturer at Columbia University and then joined the faculty of Baruch College, City University of New York, where he taught for the past 46 years. 
His areas of expertise were micro and macro price behavior over business cycles; the relationship between the stock market and the real economy; and monetary, fiscal, and growth policies. He held many leadership positions including department chair, academic director of the Executive MBA Program and the Baruch chapter chair of the Professional Staff Congress. Among his professional honors were a CUNY Distinguished Faculty Award and fellowships at Yale University and Columbia University (the latter, his alma mater). He had also been a consultant to a variety of private, United States and foreign government institutions, notably the United Nations, the Government of Greece, the Ford Foundation, the Peoples Republic of China, and United States Treasury. Beloved, esteemed, and indefatigably kind to the department faculty and staff and his students, Howard was known as a Renaissance man, especially fond of opera, tennis and the New York Yankees. He was the son of Gertrude and Bernard Rosensaft and brother of Lenore Kantrowitz, uncle to Laura, Naomi and Paul, and grand-uncle to Brian and Alex Kennedy, and to Leba Gittel and Paul Kantrowitz's children in Jerusalem, Israel. He will be greatly missed. A memorial service will be held at Baruch College on Monday, December 20, 2010, from noon to 1pm, in Room 750, Information and Technology Building, 151 East 25th St., New York.

HEADLINE: Standing By at $25,000 a Day

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
ABOARD SEAHAWK 2007, Gulf of Mexico -- For the 31 workers on this jackup oil rig, the waiting is finally over.
In recent weeks, they have been doing basic chores like painting handrails and scrubbing the deck while the federal government reviewed Castex Energy's application to drill a natural gas well in 150 feet of water in the Gulf of Mexico -- a normally quick process that turned glacial after the BP oil spill on April 20 prompted regulators to shut down almost all new drilling in the region.
The usual deafening clatter of the driller shack and engine room on the Seahawk 2007 had been replaced by relative silence. After finishing a shift, the men typically went to their cabins instead of playing poker with their buddies, hitting the weight room or watching football in the television room. With no alcohol on board, many of the men had been eating more, Kenneth Milton, a rig cook, told a reporter visiting on Monday. ''Everyone's tensed up, nervous.''
Much of that tension will now ease. On Tuesday, regulators finally granted a drilling permit to Castex, which has a contract with the Seahawk 2007 to drill the well. Over the next few days, the structure will be towed from its current location near Cameron, La., to a drill site off the Texas coast. 
''I'm glad they finally stopped dragging their feet,'' said Gerald Wayne Blanchard, the top supervisor on the rig. ''Now we can get back to work.''
But the long-term prospects for the workers on the Seahawk 2007 -- and their employer, Seahawk Drilling -- remain in doubt.
The workers still have jobs, but many of them are making significantly less than they did before the BP accident. Seahawk Drilling has suffered so much from the slowdown that it is considering selling some rigs -- and maybe the whole company.
''If we get a good offer, we're on the block,'' said Randall D. Stilley, Seahawk's president and chief executive.
That is part of the legacy of the BP disaster, which killed 11 people, spilled millions of barrels of oil, and shook up a regulatory regime that had for years granted drilling permits without much review.
Over the last few weeks, about a quarter of the gulf's 46 shallow water oil rigs were idle, according to Jim Noe, executive director of the Shallow Water Energy Security Coalition and senior vice president at Hercules Offshore. That compares with 5 to 10 percent in normal times, he said. After a flurry of permits were granted in late September and early October, he said, ''we have seen another trickle.''
Although the ban on drilling in the gulf was officially lifted weeks ago, the top regulator for offshore drilling acknowledged Tuesday that permits have been slower in coming as the government stiffened safety requirements and intensified its reviews.
''I feel terrible for the guys on the rig who did nothing wrong,'' Michael R. Bromwich, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement, said in an interview. ''They are victims.''
At the same time, Mr. Bromwich said, ''it would be odd to act as if nothing had happened in April.''
After overhauling its procedures and lifting a six-month-long moratorium, the agency is just now beginning to receive applications for new deepwater wells similar to the BP well. Applications for shallow-water wells, which are considered less risky and were frozen for only a few weeks, have been moving more quickly.
As of Tuesday morning, regulators said, they had approved 12 of the 23 permit applications submitted since June 8 and eight earlier applications that had been revised to meet tougher standards.
Mr. Bromwich said that later this week, his agency would be releasing new guidelines that ''we hope will clarify some of the ambiguities, uncertainties that we have heard about.''
Dale Johnson, a roustabout on the Seahawk 2007, is eager to get back to work.
Early this year, Mr. Johnson bought the home of his dreams in rural Mississippi: a brick house with a big front porch, a lake view, and shade from pine, oak and dogwood trees.
Weeks later, the BP well blew out. As most drilling in the gulf came to a halt, Seahawk Drilling went into a financial tailspin, and Mr. Johnson was demoted from a crane operator position paying $26 an hour to his current role, which pays $17 an hour. Even if drilling restarts, he is unlikely to get his old job, and its higher pay, back soon.
''It was a kick in the stomach,'' said Mr. Johnson, 44. ''I told my wife I feel like a nobody again.''
At Seahawk Drilling, a major shallow-water operator with 20 rigs, only seven rigs have drilling contracts with oil companies. Of those, two are still idle, waiting for their clients to get government permits. Before the BP accident, nine rigs were working, but in the summer, that number fell to as low as two. While things are picking up, top executives say they could be back down to only a handful of working rigs in January if permit approvals do not pick up.
''We're in permitorium,'' said Mr. Stilley, Seahawk's president and chief executive.
Seahawk says that each manned rig costs $25,000 a day to operate whether it is earning money or not. All told, the company lost $74 million over the first nine months of the year, and it has laid off 350 of its 900 workers.
Across the industry, a couple of thousand of oil workers have lost their jobs -- a lesser toll than once predicted but still painful.
To make matters worse for unemployed shallow-water rig workers, they are ineligible to seek compensation from BP's two relief funds because they did not technically suffer from the moratorium on deepwater drilling.
''They are in Catch-22,'' said Kenneth R. Feinberg, administrator of the Gulf Coast Claims Facility.
As they looked out from their vessel on Monday, the workers on the Seahawk 2007 saw several other mothballed company rigs with skeleton crews aboard parked in a no-man's-land they call ''the bone yard.''
The Seahawk 2007, an older rig built in the 1980s, has been underemployed since the BP accident. From April to December, the rig would have normally drilled six new wells, according to Mr. Blanchard. But since the spill, it has not drilled any new wells and was permitted only to modify three existing wells.
Things appeared to be looking up in mid-November when the rig was leased by Castex Energy, a small, privately held oil and gas company, as Castex anticipated approval to drill a new gas well. But federal regulators sent back the application several times for a variety of modifications.
Kenneth Cunningham, a 40-year-old derrick man, a senior member of the crew who manages the flow of liquids through the well bore, said Monday that workers have been living day to day. ''It's misery not knowing what tomorrow brings.''
Now he knows.
But Kurt Hoffman, the senior vice president and chief operating officer for Seahawk Drilling, said Tuesday evening that the relief might not last.
''I think it's great, but I don't see anything sustainable,'' he said. ''We have just been advised by one of our other rigs that it may be another two weeks before the federal government issues a permit. It's already been waiting a week and a half. That's long when you are paying $25,000 a day to keep the rig on standby.''

HEADLINE: Few New Jobs Expected Soon From Free-Trade Agreement With South Korea

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Peter Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The revised free-trade agreement with South Korea announced on Friday by the Obama administration has gotten acclaim from corporate leaders and Congressional Republicans.
But the pact is likely to result in little if any net job creation in the short run, according to the government's own analysis.
Praising the deal reached by his trade negotiators, President Obama said on Monday that the accord would ''boost our annual exports to South Korea by $11 billion'' and ''support at least 70,000 American jobs.'' 
The Obama administration has been careful to use the verb ''support,'' not ''create.''
In fact, the effect of the agreement on aggregate output and employment in the United States ''would likely be negligible,'' according to a federal study, largely because the United States economy is so much larger than that of South Korea. Indeed, the study found, the country's overall trade deficit with the rest of the world is likely to grow slightly as a result of the agreement.
But the deal is likely to be beneficial to particular industries, including the Detroit automakers and manufacturers of industrial and electronic equipment and high-technology products like pharmaceuticals and medical devices, according to that study.
American manufacturers of textiles and clothing could be hurt, however, as relatively high American tariffs on those products are reduced.
The study was conducted in 2007 by the United States International Trade Commission, an independent agency that analyzed the effect of imports on the American economy, after the Bush administration negotiated the original agreement with South Korea.
That agreement languished in Congress, where approval by both houses is required for a free-trade agreement to take effect. In June, President Obama agreed to reopen negotiations on reviving the stalled accord.
After a round of talks in Seoul failed to produce a deal last month, the United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, and his Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-hoon, met last week for an intense round of negotiations.
According to White House officials, the main sticking point concerned Korean barriers to American auto imports. Support for automakers has been a central motif of the Obama administration, which bailed out General Motors and Chrysler last year.
The White House consulted with the Ford Motor Company, the United Automobile Workers, and two House members from Michigan who will play a pivotal role in getting the agreement through Congress: Representative Sander M. Levin, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Representative Dave Camp, the senior Republican on the panel, who will become chairman next month.
Alan R. Mulally, chief executive of Ford, met with Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the National Economic Council. Mr. Mulally abandoned his opposition to the accord after the Koreans agreed to give the Americans more time to phase out their 2.5 percent tariff on imports of Korean cars.
The focus on autos came with a price: the United States did not make headway on lifting South Korea's ban on imports of American beef from cattle older than 30 months, a ban that was the result of an outbreak of mad-cow disease in 2003.
The Americans also agreed to a small concession on pork. The 2007 agreement called for eliminating Korean tariffs on most imports of pork products effective 2014; that has now been pushed back to 2016.
''To get a final agreement, we needed to give a little, we needed to take one for the team,'' said Sam Carney, president of the National Pork Producers Council. ''This is still a good deal for us.''
While the immediate job impact could be minimal, American corporations seeking to grow their export markets have been avid supporters of the agreement. Wal-Mart, AT&T, General Electric, Intel, Dow Corning, Boeing, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup all lauded the new deal, as did associations representing sectors like consumer electronics, movies and entertainment, poultry and egg producers and life insurers.
The pact is the largest trade accord since the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the United States signed in 1993.
''It will contribute significantly to achieving my goal of doubling U.S. exports over the next five years,'' Mr. Obama said on Saturday. ''In fact, it's estimated that today's deal alone will increase American economic output by more than our last nine free trade agreements combined.''
The 2007 study, which was updated earlier this year, projected that American merchandise exports to Korea would increase by about $9.7 billion to $10.9 billion, while merchandise imports from Korea would rise by about $6.4 billion to $6.9 billion.
John Brinkley, a spokesman for the South Korean Embassy here, said, ''The job creation potential is actually higher than 70,000'' adding that the 2007 study did not account for potential growth in the agricultural and service sectors.
In general, Korean tariffs are higher than American ones. But most Koreans are supporting the agreement, in part because they do not wish to depend too heavily on China, now their largest trading partner, according to Troy Stangarone of the Korea Economic Institute, a policy organization in Washington.
Ultimately, the deal's greatest significance may lie in the signal it sends that the Obama administration is finally willing to move forward on trade deals.
Edward Alden and Scott A. Snyder, senior fellows at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the new agreement was ''certainly better for U.S. commercial interests'' than the 2007 accord. However, they wrote in a report this week, ''by waiting so long to re-engage with Korea on substantive negotiations, the Obama administration sent a signal to the rest of the world that advancing trade was not a high priority.''

HEADLINE: Obama's News Conference to Address the Tax-Cut Plan

 BODY:
Following is a text of President Obama's news conference on Tuesday, as released by the White House:
President Obama: Good afternoon, everybody. Before I answer a few questions, I just wanted to say a few words about the agreement we've reached on tax cuts.
My number one priority is to do what's right for the American people, for jobs, and for economic growth. I'm focused on making sure that tens of millions of hardworking Americans are not seeing their paychecks shrink on January 1st just because the folks here in Washington are busy trying to score political points.
And because of this agreement, middle-class Americans won't see their taxes go up on January 1st, which is what I promised -- a promise I made during the campaign, a promise I made as President. 
Because of this agreement, 2 million Americans who lost their jobs and are looking for work will be able to pay their rent and put food on their table. And in exchange for a temporary extension of the high-income tax breaks -- not a permanent but a temporary extension -- a policy that I opposed but that Republicans are unwilling to budge on, this agreement preserves additional tax cuts for the middle class that I fought for and that Republicans opposed two years ago.
I'll cite three of them. Number one, if you are a parent trying to raise your child or pay college tuition, you will continue to see tax breaks next year. Second, if you're a small business looking to invest and grow, you'll have a tax cut next year. Third, as a result of this agreement, we will cut payroll taxes in 2011, which will add about $1,000 to the take-home pay of a typical family.
So this isn't an abstract debate. This is real money for real people that will make a real difference in the lives of the folks who sent us here. It will make a real difference in the pace of job creation and economic growth. In other words, it's a good deal for the American people.
Now, I know there are some who would have preferred a protracted political fight, even if it had meant higher taxes for all Americans, even if it had meant an end to unemployment insurance for those who are desperately looking for work.
And I understand the desire for a fight. I'm sympathetic to that. I'm as opposed to the high-end tax cuts today as I've been for years. In the long run, we simply can't afford them. And when they expire in two years, I will fight to end them, just as I suspect the Republican Party may fight to end the middle-class tax cuts that I've championed and that they've opposed.
So we're going to keep on having this debate. We're going to keep on having this battle. But in the meantime I'm not here to play games with the American people or the health of our economy. My job is to do whatever I can to get this economy moving. My job is to do whatever I can to spur job creation. My job is to look out for middle-class families who are struggling right now to get by and Americans who are out of work through no fault of their own.
A long political fight that carried over into next year might have been good politics, but it would be a bad deal for the economy and it would be a bad deal for the American people. And my responsibility as President is to do what's right for the American people. That's a responsibility I intend to uphold as long as I am in this office.
So with that, let me take a couple of questions.
Ben Feller.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You've been telling the American people all along that you oppose extending the tax cuts for the wealthier Americans. You said that again today. But what you never said was that you oppose the tax cuts, but you'd be willing to go ahead and extend them for a couple years if the politics of the moment demand it.
So what I'm wondering is when you take a stand like you had, why should the American people believe that you're going to stick with it? Why should the American people believe that you're not going to flip flop?
Mr. Obama: Hold on a second, Ben. This isn't the politics of the moment. This has to do with what can we get done right now. So the issue -- here's the choice. It's very stark. We can't get my preferred option through the Senate right now. As a consequence, if we don't get my option through the Senate right now, and we do nothing, then on January 1st of this -- of 2011, the average family is going to see their taxes go up about $3,000. Number two: At the end of this month, 2 million people will lose their unemployment insurance.
Now, I have an option, which is to say, you know what, I'm going to keep fighting a political fight, which I can't win in the Senate -- and by the way, there are going to be more Republican senators in the Senate next year sworn in than there are currently. So the likelihood that the dynamic is going to improve for us getting my preferred option through the Senate will be diminished. I've got an option of just holding fast to my position and, as a consequence, 2 million people may not be able to pay their bills and tens of millions of people who are struggling right now are suddenly going to see their paychecks smaller. Or alternatively, what I can do is I can say that I am going to stick to my position that those folks get relief, that people get help for unemployment insurance. And I will continue to fight before the American people to make the point that the Republican position is wrong.
Now, if there was not collateral damage, if this was just a matter of my politics or being able to persuade the American people to my side, then I would just stick to my guns, because the fact of the matter is the American people already agree with me. There are polls showing right now that the American people, for the most part, think it's a bad idea to provide tax cuts to the wealthy.
But the issue is not me persuading the American people; they're already there. The issue is, how do I persuade the Republicans in the Senate who are currently blocking that position. I have not been able to budge them. And I don't think there's any suggestion anybody in this room thinks realistically that we can budge them right now.
And in the meantime, there are a whole bunch of people being hurt and the economy would be damaged. And my first job is to make sure that the economy is growing, that we're creating jobs out there, and that people who are struggling are getting some relief. And if I have to choose between having a protracted political battle on the one hand, but those folks being hurt or helping those folks and continuing to fight this political battle over the next two years, I will choose the latter.
Q: If I may follow up quickly, sir, you're describing the situation you're in right now. What about the last two years when it comes to your preferred option? Was there a failure either on the part of the Democratic leadership on the Hill or here that you couldn't preclude these wealthier cuts from going forward?
Mr. Obama: Well, let me say that on the Republican side, this is their holy grail, these tax cuts for the wealthy. This is -- seems to be their central economic doctrine. And so, unless we had 60 votes in the Senate at any given time, it would be very hard for us to move this forward. I have said that I would have liked to have seen a vote before the election. I thought this was a strong position for us to take into the election, to crystallize the positions of the two parties, because I think the Democrats have better ideas. I think our proposal to make sure that the middle class is held harmless, but that we don't make these Bush tax cuts permanent for wealthy individuals, because it was going to cost the country at a time when we've got these looming deficits, that that was the better position to take. And the American people were persuaded by that.
But the fact of the matter is, I haven't persuaded the Republican Party. I haven't persuaded Mitch McConnell and I haven't persuaded John Boehner. And if I can't persuade them, then I've got to look at what is the best thing to do, given that reality, for the American people and for jobs.
Julianna.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Back in July, your budget office's Mid-Session Review forecast that unemployment would be 7.7 percent in the second -- in the fourth quarter of 2012. Will this package deal lower that projected rate? And also, is it going to do more to boost growth and create jobs than your Recovery Act?
Mr. Obama: This is not as significant a boost to the economy as the Recovery Act was, but we're in a different situation now. I mean, when the Recovery Act passed, we were looking at a potential Great Depression and we might have seen unemployment go up to 15 percent, 20 percent -- we don't know. In combination with the work we did in stabilizing the financial system, the work that the Federal Reserve did, that's behind us now. We don't have the danger of a double-dip recession.
What we have is a situation in which the economy, although growing, although company profits are up, although we are seeing some job growth in the private sector, the economy is not growing fast enough to drive down the unemployment rate given the 8 million jobs that were lost before I came into office and just as I was coming into office.
So what this package does is provide an additional boost that is substantially more significant than I think most economic forecasters had expected. And in fact, you've already seen some, just over the last 24 hours, suggest that we may see faster growth and more job growth as a consequence of this package. I think the payroll tax holiday will have an impact. Unemployment insurance probably has the biggest impact in terms of making sure that the recovery that we have continues and perhaps at a faster pace.
So, overall, every economist I've talked to suggests that this will help economic growth and this will help job growth over the next several months. And that is the main criteria by which I made this decision.
Look, this is something that I think everybody has to remember, and I would speak especially to my fellow Democrats who I think rightly are passionate about middle-class families, working families, low-income families who are having the toughest time in this economy.
The single most important jobs program we can put in place is a growing economy. The single most important anti-poverty program we can put in place is making sure folks have jobs and the economy is growing.
We can do a whole bunch of other stuff, but if the economy is not growing, if the private sector is not hiring faster than it's currently hiring, then we are going to continue to have problems no matter how many programs we put into place.
And that's why, when I look at what our options were, for us to have another three, four, five months of uncertainty, not only would that have a direct impact on the people who see their paychecks get smaller, not only would that have a direct impact on people who are unemployed and literally depend on unemployment insurance to pay the bills or keep their home or keep their car, but in terms of macroeconomics, the overall health of the economy, that would have been a damaging thing.
Q: Just to follow up. The unemployment rate was just north of 8 percent when the last Recovery Act was put in place. It's now 9.8 percent. Are you prepared to say today that the unemployment rate is going to go down as a result of this package?
Mr. Obama: My expectation is that the unemployment rate is going to be going down because the economy is growing. And even though it's growing more slowly that I'd like, it's still growing.
Now, how fast it's going to go down, how quickly the economy is going to grow, when are private sector businesses going to start making the investments in plant and equipment and actually start hiring people again? There are a lot of economists out there who have been struggling with that question.
So I'm not going to make a prediction. What I can say with confidence is that this package will help strengthen the economy -- will help strengthen the recovery. That I'm confident about.

Q: Mr. President, what do you say to Democrats who say you're rewarding Republican obstruction here? You yourself used in your opening statement they were unwilling to budge on this. A lot of progressive Democrats are saying they're unwilling to budge, and you're asking them to get off the fence and budge. Why should they be rewarding Republican obstruction?
Mr. Obama: Well, let me use a couple of analogies. I've said before that I felt that the middle-class tax cuts were being held hostage to the high-end tax cuts. I think it's tempting not to negotiate with hostage-takers, unless the hostage gets harmed. Then people will question the wisdom of that strategy. In this case, the hostage was the American people and I was not willing to see them get harmed.
Again, this not an abstract political fight. This is not isolated here in Washington. There are people right now who, when their unemployment insurance runs out, will not be able to pay the bills. There are folks right now who are just barely making it on the paycheck that they've got, and when that paycheck gets smaller on January 1st, they're going to have to scramble to figure out, how am I going to pay all my bills? How am I going to keep on making the payments for my child's college tuition? What am I going to do exactly?
Now, I could have enjoyed the battle with Republicans over the next month or two, because as I said, the American people are on our side. This is not a situation in which I have failed to persuade the American people of the rightness of our position. I know the polls. The polls are on our side on this. We weren't operating from a position of political weakness with respect to public opinion. The problem is that Republicans feel that this is the single most important thing that they have to fight for as a party. And in light of that, it was going to be a protracted battle and they would have a stronger position next year than they do currently.
So I guess another way of thinking about it is that if -- certainly if we had made a determination that the deal was a permanent tax break for high-income individuals in exchange for these short-term things that people need right now, that would have been unacceptable. And the reason is, is because you would be looking at $700 billion that would be added to the deficit with very little on the short term that would help to offset that.
The deal that we've struck here makes the high-end tax cuts temporary, and that gives us the time to have this political battle without having the same casualties for the American people that are my number one concern.
Q: If I may follow, aren't you telegraphing, though, a negotiating strategy of how the Republicans can beat you in negotiations all the way through the next year because they can just stick to their guns, stay united, be unwilling to budge -- to use your words -- and force you to capitulate?
Mr. Obama: I don't think so. And the reason is because this is a very unique circumstance. This is a situation in which tens of millions of people would be directly damaged and immediately damaged, and at a time when the economy is just about to recover.
Now, keep in mind, I've just gone through two years, Chuck, where the rap on me was I was too stubborn and wasn't willing to budge on a whole bunch of issues -- including, by the way, health care where everybody here was writing about how, despite public opinion and despite this and despite that, somehow the guy is going to bulldoze his way through this thing.
Q: Tell that to the left -- they weren't happy --
Mr. Obama: Well, but that's my point. My point is I don't make judgments based on what the conventional wisdom is at any given time. I make my judgments based on what I think is right for the country and for the American people right now.
And I will be happy to see the Republicans test whether or not I'm itching for a fight on a whole range of issues. I suspect they will find I am. And I think the American people will be on my side on a whole bunch of these fights. But right now I want to make sure that the American people aren't hurt because we're having a political fight, and I think that this agreement accomplishes that.
And, as I said, there are a whole bunch of things that they are giving up. I mean, the truth of the matter is, from the Republican perspective, the Earned Income Tax Credit, the college tuition tax credit, the Child Tax Credit -- all those things that are so important for so many families across the country -- those are things they really opposed. And so temporarily, they are willing to go along with that, presumably because they think they can beat me on that over the course of the next two years.
And I'm happy to have that battle. I'm happy to have that conversation. I just want to make sure that the American people aren't harmed while we're having that broader argument.
Scott Horsley.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Last week members of your administration were boasting that your willingness to walk away from the Korean negotiations led to a better deal. Can you explain how this is --
Mr. Obama:The difference is that if I didn't get the Korea deal done on January 1st the taxes of middle-class America wouldn't go up. It's pretty straightforward. If we didn't get the Korea deal done by January 1st, 2 million people weren't suddenly looking at having no way to support their families.
And that's why -- this goes to Chuck's question as well about what's going to be different in the future. You've got a situation here that was urgent for millions of people. But as I recall, with the Korea free trade agreement, that was deemed by conventional wisdom as an example of us not getting something done. I remember a story above the fold on that. Then when we got it done with a better deal that has the endorsement of not only the U.S. auto companies but also of labor, the story was sort of below the fold. So I would just point that out. I think -- I am happy to be tested over the next several months about our ability to negotiate with Republicans.
Q: Having bought that time now, do you hope to use this two-year window to push for a broader overhaul of the tax code?
Mr. Obama: Yes. And the answer is yes. Part of what I want to do is to essentially get the American people in a safe place so that we can then get the economy in a stable place. And then we're going to have to have a broad-based discussion across the country about our priorities. And I started doing that yesterday down in North Carolina.
Here's going to be the long-term issue. We've had two years of emergency -- emergency economic action on the banking industry, the auto industry, on unemployment insurance, on a whole range of issues -- on state budgets. The situation has now stabilized, although for those folks who are out of work, it's still an emergency. So we've still got to focus short term on job growth.
But we've got to have a larger debate about how is this -- how is this country going to win the economic competition of the 21st century? How are we going to make sure that we've got the best-trained workers in the world? There was just a study that came out today showing how we've slipped even further when it comes to math education and science education.
So what are we doing to revamp our schools to make sure our kids can compete? What are we doing in terms of research and development to make sure that innovation is still taking place here in the United States of America? What are we doing about our infrastructure so that we have the best airports and the best roads and the best bridges? And how are we going to pay for all that at a time when we've got both short-term deficit problems, medium-term deficit problems, and long-term deficit problems?
Now, that's going to be a big debate. And it's going to involve us sorting out what government functions are adding to our competitiveness and increasing opportunity and making sure that we're growing the economy, and which aspects of the government aren't helping.
And then we've got to figure out how do we pay for that. And that's going to mean looking at the tax code and saying, what's fair, what's efficient. And I don't think anybody thinks the tax code right now is fair or efficient. But we've got to make sure that we don't just paper over those problems by borrowing from China or Saudi Arabia. And so that's going to be a major conversation.
And in that context, I don't see how the Republicans win that argument. I don't know how they're going to be able to argue that extending permanently these high-end tax cuts is going to be good for our economy when, to offset them, we'd end up having to cut vital services for our kids, for our veterans, for our seniors.
But I'm happy to listen to their arguments. And I think the American people will benefit from that debate. And that's going to be starting next year.
Marc Ambinder.
Q: Mr. President, thank you. How do these negotiations affect negotiations or talks with Republicans about raising the debt limit? Because it would seem that they have a significant amount of leverage over the White House now, going in. Was there ever any attempt by the White House to include raising the debt limit as a part of this package?
Mr. Obama: When you say it would seem they'll have a significant amount of leverage over the White House, what do you mean?
Q: Just in the sense that they'll say essentially we're not going to raise the -- we're not going to agree to it unless the White House is able to or willing to agree to significant spending cuts across the board that probably go deeper and further than what you're willing to do. I mean, what leverage would you have --
Mr. Obama: Look, here's my expectation -- and I'll take John Boehner at his word -- that nobody, Democrat or Republican, is willing to see the full faith and credit of the United States government collapse, that that would not be a good thing to happen. And so I think that there will be significant discussions about the debt limit vote. That's something that nobody ever likes to vote on. But once John Boehner is sworn in as Speaker, then he's going to have responsibilities to govern. You can't just stand on the sidelines and be a bomb thrower.
And so my expectation is, is that we will have tough negotiations around the budget, but that ultimately we can arrive at a position that is keeping the government open, keeping Social Security checks going out, keeping veterans services being provided, but at the same time is prudent when it comes to taxpayer dollars.
Jonathan Weisman, last question.
Q: Some on the left have questioned -- have looked at this deal and questioned what your core values are, what specifically you will go to the mat on. I'm wondering if you can reassure them with some specific things in saying, all right, this is where I don't budge. And along those lines, what's going to be different in 2012, when all these tax cuts again are up for expiration?
Mr. Obama: Well, what's going to be different in 2012 we've just discussed, which is we will have had two years to discuss the budget -- not in the abstract, but in concrete terms. Over the last two years, the Republicans have had the benefit of watching us take all these emergency actions, having us preside over a $1.3 trillion deficit that we inherited and just pointing fingers and saying, that's their problem.
Well, over the next two years, they're going to have to show me what it is that they think they can do. And I think it becomes pretty clear, after you go through the budget line by line, that if in fact they want to pay for $700 billion worth of tax breaks to wealthy individuals, that that's a lot of money and that the cuts -- corresponding cuts that would have to be made are very painful. So either they rethink their position, or I don't think they're going to do very well in 2012. So that's on the first point.
With respect to the bottom line in terms of what my core principles are --
Q: Where is your line in the sand?
Mr. Obama: Well, look, I've got a whole bunch of lines in the sand. Not making the tax cuts for the wealthy permanent -- that was a line in the sand. Making sure that the things that most impact middle-class families and low-income families, that those were preserved -- that was a line in the sand. I would not have agreed to a deal, which, by the way, some in Congress were talking about, of just a two-year extension on the Bush tax cuts and one year of unemployment insurance, but meanwhile all the other provisions, the Earned Income Tax Credit or other important breaks for middle-class families like the college tax credit, that those had gone away just because they had Obama's name attached to them instead of Bush's name attached to them.
So this notion that somehow we are willing to compromise too much reminds me of the debate that we had during health care. This is the public option debate all over again. So I pass a signature piece of legislation where we finally get health care for all Americans, something that Democrats had been fighting for for a hundred years, but because there was a provision in there that they didn't get that would have affected maybe a couple of million people, even though we got health insurance for 30 million people and the potential for lower premiums for 100 million people, that somehow that was a sign of weakness and compromise.
Now, if that's the standard by which we are measuring success or core principles, then let's face it, we will never get anything done. People will have the satisfaction of having a purist position and no victories for the American people. And we will be able to feel good about ourselves and sanctimonious about how pure our intentions are and how tough we are, and in the meantime, the American people are still seeing themselves not able to get health insurance because of preexisting conditions or not being able to pay their bills because their unemployment insurance ran out.
That can't be the measure of how we think about our public service. That can't be the measure of what it means to be a Democrat. This is a big, diverse country. Not everybody agrees with us. I know that shocks people. The New York Times editorial page does not permeate across all of America. Neither does The Wall Street Journal editorial page. Most Americans, they're just trying to figure out how to go about their lives and how can we make sure that our elected officials are looking out for us. And that means because it's a big, diverse country and people have a lot of complicated positions, it means that in order to get stuff done, we're going to compromise. This is why FDR, when he started Social Security, it only affected widows and orphans. You did not qualify. And yet now it is something that really helps a lot of people. When Medicare was started, it was a small program. It grew.
Under the criteria that you just set out, each of those were betrayals of some abstract ideal. This country was founded on compromise. I couldn't go through the front door at this country's founding. And if we were really thinking about ideal positions, we wouldn't have a union.
So my job is to make sure that we have a North Star out there. What is helping the American people live out their lives? What is giving them more opportunity? What is growing the economy? What is making us more competitive? And at any given juncture, there are going to be times where my preferred option, what I am absolutely positive is right, I can't get done.
And so then my question is, does it make sense for me to tack a little bit this way or tack a little bit that way, because I'm keeping my eye on the long term and the long fight -- not my day-to-day news cycle, but where am I going over the long term?
And I don't think there's a single Democrat out there, who if they looked at where we started when I came into office and look at where we are now, would say that somehow we have not moved in the direction that I promised.
Take a tally. Look at what I promised during the campaign. There's not a single thing that I've said that I would do that I have not either done or tried to do. And if I haven't gotten it done yet, I'm still trying to do it.
And so the -- to my Democratic friends, what I'd suggest is, let's make sure that we understand this is a long game. This is not a short game. And to my Republican friends, I would suggest -- I think this is a good agreement, because I know that they're swallowing some things that they don't like as well, and I'm looking forward to seeing them on the field of competition over the next two years.

HEADLINE: The Messages in a Tax-Cut Pact

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''In Deal With G.O.P., a Portent for the Next 2 Years'' (news analysis, Dec. 7):
As one of the millions of Americans in need of long-term unemployment benefits, I would be grateful for any agreement that keeps this program in place. But extending these benefits did not have to be part of the proposed tax deal between President Obama and the Congressional Republicans.
For months now, unemployment benefits have been held hostage equally by the Republican demand that any extension of benefits be accompanied by equivalent spending cuts and by the Democratic insistence that it should not be. 
If President Obama and the Democrats had agreed to find a way to pay for extended unemployment benefits within the budget, they could have removed this bargaining chip from the Republicans' side. To do so would have been a concession to the Republicans, but one not nearly as large as the capitulation Mr. Obama now proposes.
Larry Shea Asheville, N.C., Dec. 7, 2010
To the Editor:
President Obama's decision to compromise with the Republicans on taxes (''Obama Reaches Accord With G.O.P. on Tax Cut; Democrats Hold Back,'' front page, Dec. 7) was both wise and necessary.
The compromise will ensure that middle-class Americans will not see a rise in their income tax rates during difficult economic times. The compromise will also provide extended unemployment insurance benefits for millions of Americans. This is not only morally justified, but also will provide needed economic stimulus.
Some members of the Democratic Party attack the president for not fighting harder. As the president eloquently stated, for the millions who would have seen their taxes rise or their unemployment benefits end, this is not some ideological game.
The president was right to make the decision he did, and to point out Republican obstructionism and the need to do better.
Robert R. Salman Marlboro, N.J., Dec. 7, 2010
To the Editor:
Remember the Republican mantra ''starve the beast''? This is the notion that the way to a smaller government is to starve it of tax revenues. Well, it's finally happening with President Obama's caving in to Republican demands.
Also, the proposed reduction in Social Security taxes is another attack on this retirement system by the Republicans.
However, the likely result of these actions will not be smaller government but suffocating debt, which will put us on the same page as Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal.
Stanley F. Fox Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., Dec. 7, 2010
The writer is an associate professor, department of business administration and accounting, St. Joseph's College.
To the Editor:
From the beginning, President Obama has wanted to leave behind both the talk-show conservatives and the to-the-barricades liberals and to embrace policies that celebrate both American enterprise and the American ideal of fairness.
Until today, I hadn't thought that his pragmatism could put down roots in our partisan landscape.
Bob Brussack Athens, Ga., Dec. 7, 2010
To the Editor:
The sound bite says ''tax cuts for the richest Americans.'' But it is more than that.
This is about a sea change. This is about shifting much more of the cost of government onto the backs of poorer Americans.
The richest Americans have already fared well. They have seen their incomes and wealth soar, while most others are struggling with flat or even declining incomes, health benefits and retirement savings. Taxes of the richest Americans have plummeted -- top marginal tax rates have gone from 90 percent in the 1950s to 35 percent.
All Americans will be saddled with the cost of tax break extensions for the wealthiest.
There is no free lunch. We must all do what we can to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
Richard Dickinson Glendale, Calif., Dec. 7, 2010
To the Editor:
Re ''The Tax Cut Endgame'' (editorial, Dec. 7):
''Obstructionism'' is what Democrats charged Republicans with when they wouldn't go along with the Democrats' spending. Now the same charge is made about Republicans' refusal to raise taxes.
What will it take for Democrats to understand that ''obstructing'' excessive spending and tax increases is exactly what a majority of American voters voted for in the recent election?
Andrea Economos Scarsdale, N.Y., Dec. 7, 2010
To the Editor:
I admire President Obama for choosing practicality over ideology in reaching a compromise with Republicans on the tax cut and unemployment compensation issues. I only hope that my liberal friends will recognize that we must all be willing to give something in order to move the nation forward, while continuing the struggle against the extreme right.
Patrick Frank Kingstree, S.C., Dec. 7, 2010

HEADLINE: Biden and G.O.P. Leader Helped Hammer Out Bipartisan Tax Accord

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As a bipartisan group of Congressional tax writers opened widely watched negotiations last Wednesday over what to do about expiring tax cuts, a secret set of tax talks was taking place just steps off the Senate floor.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and a single staff member had slipped into the ceremonial office of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to try to hash out a compromise directly with the vice president, who was accompanied by a top aide of his own, Ron Klain, his chief of staff.
The meeting was one of a number of direct conversations over the next few days between Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell, the Senate Republican leader and a Senate colleague of Mr. Biden's for nearly 25 years, that ultimately led to the agreement reached Monday. It was a bipartisan bargain that -- in a startling departure from the past two years in the capital -- ended with Republicans praising it and Democrats claiming they were blindsided and undercut.
According to those knowledgeable about the events that played out over less than a week, the agreement was the product of a fast-paced series of telephone contacts, conference calls and consultations with Congressional leaders. A critical negotiation on Sunday led to a surprise cut in employee payroll taxes as the men sought to wrap up the deal. 
The final pieces came together Monday, when the vice president called Mr. McConnell to inform him of the White House's price for accepting the Republican plan to provide a generous exemption for taxing wealthy estates. Mr. McConnell called Mr. Biden back late in the day to deliver the Republican sign-off on the administration's proposed tax breaks for low- and middle-income workers.
The intense back and forth suggests a possible template for how the two parties might interact next year when Republicans control the House and have added to their numbers in the Senate.
''There is still much left to be done for the American people in the next two years, and I am hoping this won't be the last time we can do something for the country on a bipartisan basis,'' Mr. McConnell said on Tuesday, suggesting that divided government could provide an opening for tackling such explosive subjects as entitlement spending.
With hefty Democratic majorities in Congress the past two years, the White House has had little direct engagement with the Republican leadership, trying instead to win over individual Republicans on a bill-by-bill basis.
That situation seems to have shifted markedly since the midterm elections, though the White House sought to portray Mr. Biden's role in the tax negotiations as similar to his efforts to produce forward movement on a nuclear arms reduction treaty and other issues that could benefit from his nearly four decades in the Senate.
''He has from the beginning been an uber liaison to his former colleagues,'' one aide said.
But the depth of the personal negotiations between Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell was remarkable. It began with an unsolicited phone call from the vice president to the Republican leader's office just hours after the first post-election bipartisan meeting at the White House on Nov. 30.
By that session, according to administration officials, Mr. Obama had decided not to side with those in his administration and among Congressional Democrats who were spoiling to fight Republicans on the Bush-era tax cuts for those with high incomes even though the Democrats appeared to lack the votes in the Senate. Instead, he would test Republicans' willingness to make concessions for economic stimulus measures and ''the Obama tax cuts'' for low- and middle-income workers. Then, if Republicans gave him the back of the hand, he would fight.
Mr. Obama was propelled to his decision in part by a Nov. 18 meeting with Democratic Congressional leaders that persuaded him the Democrats were not unified behind a realistic plan for moving forward.
So at the bipartisan leadership meeting last week, the White House and Congressional leaders agreed to what became known as ''the six-pack'' talks, with two negotiators each to represent the White House, Congressional Democrats and Congressional Republicans. At the same time, Mr. Obama made an undisclosed move that proved more conclusive: He gave a green light to Mr. Biden to pursue a parallel line of communication with Mr. McConnell.
Still, administration officials insist the six-member negotiations were pivotal as well, and early decisions on handling the alternative minimum tax and a separate array of expired or expiring tax breaks, including the credit for corporations' research and development costs, were worked out in that group.
''There was never a time when that was a fake meeting and the real thing was somewhere else,'' said an administration official. ''I know what it's like to go to a meeting that's Kabuki theater; this wasn't like that.''
The administration's original wish list included the 13 months of extended federal unemployment compensation for people out of jobs for a long time and the extended tax credits for the working poor, college students and lower-income families with children. But the White House was pessimistic that Republicans would go along with the tax credits for lower-income people.
Indeed, the Republicans' resistance to Mr. Obama's signature tax cut -- the ''Making Work Pay'' payroll tax reduction that was part of his original 2009 economic stimulus package -- forced the administration team to look for an alternative.
The late-hour substitute on Sunday was the proposal for a reduction of two percentage points in employees' 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax for 2011. A payroll-tax holiday has been an idea on Mr. Obama's table for months, but he and Congressional Democrats always pushed it aside, given concerns that voters, especially older people, would see it as taking revenues that are supposed to pay for Social Security benefits.
But pushing the idea all along was Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and his counselor Gene Sperling, a former top economic policy adviser to President Bill Clinton. Last Friday, the report that the unemployment rate had inched up to 9.8 percent gave new impetus to the administration's push -- and to Mr. Biden's talks with Mr. McConnell.
By Sunday night, the two sides had agreed to a two-year extension of all the Bush tax rates in return for the unemployment aid and a payroll-tax holiday. The final negotiations came down to Republicans' demand for a generous new estate-tax formulation -- and the White House's insistence on extending the package of tax breaks for low- and middle-income students, workers and families with children.
Those tax breaks came to be called ''the refundables'' because eligible taxpayers would get a tax refund check for any amount that exceeded their actual income-tax liability. Republicans generally oppose refundable tax credits, considering it, in effect, welfare spending. But they saw the talks as a golden opportunity to win an estate-tax agreement that had eluded them even when they controlled Congress and the White House.
On Monday morning, Mr. Biden met with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office before the president left for a day trip to Winston-Salem, N.C., to speak about education. Mr. Obama told him to give Mr. McConnell an ultimatum.
''My strong instinct is that we make the deal if we can,'' the president said. But, he added, to accept Republicans' estate tax break ''would be too heavy a lift.''
Mr. Biden returned to his West Wing office and called Mr. McConnell.
''We will not do the estate tax without the other stuff,'' he told him, according to officials. ''There's just no deal without the refundables. Won't do it.''
Mr. McConnell did not call Mr. Biden back with an answer until 5 p.m., after consulting with other Republicans. ''We have the deal,'' Mr. McConnell said.
By then Mr. Obama was already back from North Carolina, and Mr. Biden went to the Oval Office to inform him. The president said, ''O.K., if that's a deal we can live with, let's do it.'' Mr. Biden walked back to his office to call Mr. McConnell.
''We're on,'' the vice president informed Mr. McConnell.

GENEVA -- Tense talks between Iran, the United States and other world powers ended Tuesday with an agreement to hold another meeting toward the end of January in Istanbul.
''Our expectations for this meeting were low, and I can't say that they've been exceeded,'' said a senior American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. He characterized the tenor of the discussions, in which Iran was pressed on its nuclear program, as ''difficult and candid.''
Still, the official said, the simple fact that Iran agreed to meet in the first place, and to a future meeting as well, was positive, coming after more than a year of domestic friction over Iran's disputed presidential election and the imposition of a fourth round of United Nations economic sanctions that was followed by additional independent measures from the United States and other nations. 
Iran had maintained that its nuclear program was not open for discussion, but officials who attended the talks said that, despite Iranian denials, most of the day and a half of meetings focused on the deep concerns of many of Iran's neighbors and much of the West that the country was trying to build a bomb. Iran maintains that its nuclear program is merely to generate power and create medical isotopes.
A senior European official said that the talks evidenced a level of mistrust between Iran and the other powers that could be compared only to the situation with North Korea, and that it was important to continue to offer serious negotiations in combination with the possibility of harsher measures, including further sanctions.
But the Iranian side ended the meetings on a note of defiance. The head of its delegation, Saeed Jalili, said at a news conference that the only agenda for the Istanbul meeting was ''to have talks for cooperation to find common ground'' and insisted that international requests for Iran to halt its enrichment of uranium would not be discussed.
''I am announcing openly and clearly that Iran will not discuss a uranium enrichment halt in the next meeting in Istanbul with major powers,'' Mr. Jalili said, portraying Iran as being at the height of its power, economically and regionally, despite the buildup of international sanctions.
He spoke at a podium flanked by a black-bordered portrait of an Iranian nuclear scientist, Majid Shahriari, who was killed Nov. 29 in Tehran when a bomb attached to his car exploded, an attack the Iranians have blamed on the West and Israel.
Officials said that during the talks, Mr. Jalili gave an impassioned critique of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear watchdog, and quoted ''highly selectively'' from its reports on Iran.
But his negotiating partners repeated their demand that Iran cooperate fully with the agency, whose last report said that Iran was not doing so.
Besides Iran, the nations represented here at the talks, led by Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, were the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany. They are known as the ''P5 plus 1'' -- the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany.
While repetitive, the American official said, the talks ''were part of a clear dual-track strategy'' of negotiations backed up by sanctions and the possibility of military force, and were important to display to the Iranians ''our seriousness on both tracks and to keep P5 plus 1 unity'' so that Iran could not divide one nation from another.
In Dubai on Tuesday, six gulf Arab leaders appealed to Iran to ''respond positively'' to talks about its nuclear program and to be ''a good neighbor'' in the region. In a statement, the Gulf Cooperation Council said it ''welcomes international efforts, including those made by the P5+1, to peacefully resolve Iran's nuclear crisis and hopes it will respond positively to these efforts.''
The last talks with Iran, more than a year ago, yielded a tentative agreement for uranium enrichment for medical use outside the country, a deal that rapidly fell apart. The accomplishment here, the American official said, was to ''restart'' the nuclear talks and ''begin a systematic process of confidence-building through practical steps.''
Iran needs ''to show that it is serious,'' but the process of talking ''cannot be open-ended,'' he said, acknowledging that Iran historically has tried to buy time and divide its critics.
The senior European official echoed that assessment, saying: ''There was no breakthrough, no great leap forward. As for progress, we made a restart, we re-engaged. But if we take this forward, we need to find some substance to move forward on.''
Possible confidence-building measures, the Western officials said, could include a revision of the October 2009 deal to remove a major portion of Iran's enriched uranium so it could be turned into nuclear fuel rods abroad.

HEADLINE: AGL Resources Buys Nicor to Create a Large Natural Gas Distributor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
AGL Resources agreed on Tuesday to buy a fellow power company, Nicor, for $2.4 billion in cash and stock, in a bid to create a big new natural gas distributor. 
The merger of AGL and Nicor will create a natural gas company with about 5.5 million customers across seven states in both its regulated and unregulated businesses, as well as $5.1 billion in annual revenue.
''We will effectively double the number of utility customers we serve, and by sharing best practices, and through the benefits of greater scale, we will be able to serve those customers better and more efficiently,'' John W. Somerhalder II, AGL's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
It is the latest energy deal in a year full of them, many seizing on low natural gas prices to bolster consolidation in the industry. Deals worth $464.5 billion have been struck in the sector this year, the highest volume of energy-related mergers since 2007, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Deal activity in the industry accounted for 21.3 percent of all mergers announced this year.
Under the terms of the deal, AGL will pay $21.20 in cash and .8382 of an AGL share for each Nicor share, worth about $50.52 at Tuesday's closing stock price. Based on AGL's volume-weighted average stock price for the 20 days ended Dec. 1, the deal is worth $53 a share. That represents a 22 percent premium to Nicor's closing share price on that day, the last day before speculation about a potential deal emerged.
The new company will keep the AGL name and remain based in Atlanta, though it will establish a gas distribution headquarters in Nicor's hometown, Naperville, Ill. Neither company disclosed specifics on how they intended to achieve cost savings, though analysts said greater economies of scale would be possible.
David E. Parker, an analyst with Robert W. Baird Securities, added in a research note on Tuesday that the combined company could also sell Nicor's tropical shipping business, a noncore operation whose earnings have been volatile.
AGL was built upon a series of acquisitions by Atlanta Gas Light, the biggest natural gas distributor in the Southeast.
Though founded in 1954, Nicor traces its corporate lineage back to the Ottawa Gas Light and Coke Company, which provided lighting for one of the historic Lincoln-Douglas debates in 1858.
Mr. Somerhalder, AGL's chairman and chief executive, will retain both positions, although four Nicor directors will join AGL's board.
After the deal is completed, which is expected in the second half of 2011, AGL shareholders will own 67 percent of the combined company and Nicor shareholders will own the rest.
AGL was advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf. Nicor was advised by JPMorgan Chase and the law firm Latham & Watkins, while its board was counseled by Sidley Austin.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Europe Deal Moves Russia A Step Closer To W.T.O.

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
BRUSSELS (AP) -- The European Union and Russia have reached a deal settling outstanding trade issues that should smooth the way for Russia to become a member of the World Trade Organization next year. 
The president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, met with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia on Tuesday and said that the agreement was a milestone in relations.
Russia is the only major trading power that is not part of the W.T.O. Over the last few years, it has been working to settle bilateral trade issues like export duties and meat import restrictions.
Mr. Barroso said Russia's becoming a W.T.O. member in 2011 was a ''realistic perspective.'' Russia still has to settle some outstanding issues with the W.T.O. itself before it can join the organization.
''W.T.O. accession will strengthen trade and investment rules in Russia and will therefore be beneficial to its businesses and its citizens,'' Mr. Barroso said. It will also improve business opportunities for European companies in the expanding market.
The agreement underscored the improving relations between Europe and Russia. On Monday, Mr. Medvedev started his good will mission by visiting Poland, a former Soviet satellite and current European Union member with which it has had a troubled relationship over the years.
Despite the global economic crisis, trade with Russia picked up this year after a sharp slump in 2009.
In the first nine months, Russia was the European Union's third-biggest trading partner, after the United States and China, accounting for 6 percent of the region's exports and 10 percent of its imports.

HEADLINE: Tax Package Will Aid Nearly All, With the Highest Earners Benefiting Most

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
The deal to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for two years includes a bevy of additional credits and deductions that will reduce the burden on nearly all households.
But the tax benefits will flow most heavily to the highest earners, just as the original cuts did when they were passed in 2001 and 2003. At least a quarter of the tax savings will go to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population.
The tentative deal includes a two-year patch for the alternative minimum tax, a reduction in the payroll tax and a plan to reinstate the estate tax with lower rates and higher exemptions than in 2009 -- all of which will offer far more savings for high earners than those in the low- or middle-income bracket. 
The wealthiest Americans will also reap tax savings from the proposal's plan to keep the cap on dividend and capital gains taxes at 15 percent, well below the highest rates on ordinary income.
And negotiators have agreed that the estimated $900 billion cost of the cuts will simply be added to the deficit -- not covered by reductions in spending or increases in other taxes. That is good news for hedge fund managers and private equity investors, who appear to have withstood an effort to get them to pay more by eliminating a quirk in the tax code that allows most of their income to be taxed at just 15 percent.
In fact, the only groups likely to face a tax increase are those near the bottom of the income scale -- individuals who make less than $20,000 and families with earnings below $40,000.
''It's going to look like the rich are getting richer again,'' said Anne Mathias, an analyst for MF Global Inc.
In the agreement, which breaks a campaign pledge to eliminate some tax breaks for the top 2 percent of American earners, President Obama won a few concessions from Republicans, including a 13-month extension in government benefits for the long-term unemployed. After several extensions, the maximum has been 99 weeks.
The administration also succeeded in extending several of the tax credits in last year's stimulus plan to aid low- and moderate-income Americans: the earned-income tax credit, the child credit, the child and dependent-care credit and the tuition deduction.
As a result, families with an income near the median of $55,000 would owe about $2,700 less in taxes than if the Bush-era cuts had been allowed to expire.
A two-income couple earning $146,000 would owe about $7,000 less than if the tax cuts were allowed to expire, and about $3,400 less than they did in 2009.
The proposal does not include an extension of Mr. Obama's signature tax cut, the Making Work Pay credit, which provided a credit of up to $400 for individuals and $800 for families of low and moderate income. Instead, the plan creates a one-year reduction in Social Security payroll taxes, which are generally levied on the first $106,800 of income. For an individual earning $110,000, that provision would reduce payroll taxes by $2,136.
Although the $120 billion payroll tax reduction offers nearly twice the tax savings of the credit it replaces, it will nonetheless lead to higher tax bills for individuals with incomes below $20,000 and families that make less than $40,000. That is because their payroll tax savings are less than the $400 or $800 they will lose from the Making Work Pay credit.
''It will come to a few dollars a week,'' said Roberton Williams, an analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, ''but it is an increase.''
To the wealthiest Americans, however, an assortment of breaks is available.
The plan includes a two-year ''patch'' for the alternative minimum tax, which is now paid by about 4 million taxpayers with income in the mid- to high six figures. Without the patch, more than 20 million additional taxpayers would have been liable for that tax.
The estate tax -- which was allowed to lapse this year and was scheduled to resume at a rate of 55 percent on most assets above $1 million -- will be reinstated under less onerous terms. Estates over $5 million will be subject to a 35 percent tax.
The proposal will also maintain the current rates on dividends and capital gains, averting scheduled increases to ordinary income and 20 percent, respectively.
The marginal tax rate on high incomes will also remain unchanged. The top brackets had been scheduled to increase to 36 percent and 39.6 percent, from 33 percent and 35 percent.
Under Mr. Obama's failed proposal, which would have raised the rates on income over $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals, the taxpayers at the top 1 percent of the income scale -- those with incomes above $564,000 -- would have received an average tax break of $28,000. Under the agreement reached with Republicans, the top 1 percent will receive breaks of about $70,000.

HEADLINE: Bonds Fall on Fear That Tax Cut Deal Will Add to Deficit, but Stocks Are Steady

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The bond market on Tuesday had one of its worst days this year as it sold off over concerns that President Obama's tax deal would add to the nation's budget deficit.
Mr. Obama said on Monday night that he had an agreement with Congressional Republicans to extend the Bush-era tax cuts at all income levels for two years, raising concerns that such a move would increase the deficit even as it inspired confidence in the economy.
When the markets opened Tuesday, stock indexes rose and held gains most of the day as emboldened investors assumed more risk and drained life from the Treasury market. 
The tax deal could mean an increase in growth rates in the United States, with rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates.
Bond prices fell, while yields shot up. Pressure built on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note. Its yield has risen since hitting 2.39 percent on Oct. 7.
On Tuesday, it rapidly crossed a psychological threshold of 3.08 percent. The yield on the 10-year note was 3.13 percent, up significantly from 2.93 percent late Monday. Its price dropped 1 23/32, to 95 22/32.
Higher yields, if sustained, will mean costlier home mortgage rates. The jump in rates has taken place even as the Federal Reserve has acted to contain borrowing costs to aid the recovery.
Anthony G. Valeri, a market strategist for LPL Financial, said the bond market performance also demonstrated anticipation that the Fed might raise interest rates sooner. ''We had a pretty violent reaction to the passage of the tax cut extension,'' he said.
In addition, the bond sell-off made investors timid before auctions this week of 10-year and 30-year notes. ''As if today's selling wasn't enough, we have got fresh supply coming in tomorrow,'' Mr. Valeri said.
The effect could also signal that the government will have to sell more bonds to finance the deficit, said Guy LeBas, the chief fixed income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott.
But the tax deal could have positive implications for the economy, which spurred investors to reconsider the allocation of their assets. Consumer spending, business investment and corporate profits could increase, Wells Fargo economists said in a research note.
Stocks rallied on the news, but lost some steam at the end of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.03 points, or 0.03 percent, to 11,359.16. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hit a two-year high during the day but closed up just 0.63 points, or 0.05 percent, at 1,223.75 while the Nasdaq composite index was up 3.57 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,598.49.
Analysts said investors were primed to leave havens and return to riskier equities because of upbeat trends in economic data -- Friday's jobs report notwithstanding -- and signs of some calm in the European markets.
The CRB commodities index ended down but copper rose more than 1 percent on prospects of a recovery. Financials, which are affected more by interest rates, were weaker. But Citigroup was up more than 3.8 percent at $4.62 after the United States Treasury said late Monday that it had sold its remaining stake in the bank.A report from the Federal Reserve said total consumer credit outstanding rose at an annual rate of 1.7 percent to reach $2.39 trillion in October as nonrevolving accounts climbed.

HEADLINE: At Morgan, A Struggle Over Big Pay

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
Even as Wall Street prepares to hand out rich year-end bonuses, one firm, Morgan Stanley, is mapping out a plan to reduce the pay of some of its senior executives, according to people with knowledge of the plan.
The effort to rein in compensation in the management ranks - while still rewarding its top traders and bankers - is one way that Morgan Stanley is coming to grips with a quandary that has plagued it for a year. 
Shaken from the financial crisis, Morgan Stanley's board and its newly installed chief executive, James P. Gorman, decided in early 2010 that the firm needed to spend money to hire and begin to rebuild. But the firm already had bloated compensation levels. A year later, it has hired 2,000 people but has had little revenue growth.
In response to shareholder complaints about the high employee expenses, Mr. Gorman publicly vowed in February to reduce the firm's payout.
Now, instead of layoffs, Morgan Stanley is planning to cut the pay of many top executives, typically the top earners, the people with knowledge of the plan say, in order to get its compensation levels down.
Recently, Mr. Gorman has been telling employees that the selective, short-term pain on compensation will give the firm credibility with shareholders and help the firm long term. Mr. Gorman has told employees that 2010 is ''the year of differentiation,'' these people say, speaking only on the condition of anonymity.
This means employees who did well will get paid competitively. The rest will see their compensation fall. Divisions like equities, which includes stock trading, and investment banking performed well in 2010, and those employees can expect decent bonuses, these people said. But traders in the firm's fixed-income department, which did not have a great year, may see smaller pay packages, these people say.
''Our long-term success depends on retaining the best people, and we are committed to paying competitively,'' said a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman.
Mr. Gorman came under fire from shareholders at his firm's services conference in February for paying outsize bonuses to employees in 2009. Morgan Stanley paid out a record 62 percent of its net revenue in compensation and benefits that year. Wall Street firms typically pay 40 to 45 percent of their revenue in compensation.
Mr. Gorman told attendees the 62 percent ratio was a ''historic high'' that no one on his management team ''will ever see again.'' He indicated that it should be no higher than 50 percent.
One rival, Goldman Sachs, had a ratio of 36 percent in 2009. Two institutional shareholders sued Morgan Stanley in February, accusing the bank of overpaying employees in recent years. The lawsuit, filed in New York State Supreme Court, is pending. Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
''I am willing to give him some more time, but as a shareholder I want to get something decent soon for owning this firm,'' said Anton V. Schutz, manager of Burnham Financial Funds. His funds control 150,000 shares of Morgan Stanley, valued at $3.9 million. Mr. Schutz is not a party to the shareholder suit.
This year Morgan Stanley is on track to pay out $15.98 billion, or about 50.4 percent of its net revenue, in compensation and benefits. This is lower than 2009 but compares with an average ratio of 43 percent from 2003 to 2006, the year before the credit crisis took hold.
In the most recent quarter, however, as revenue tumbled amid a slowdown in trading, Morgan allocated almost 58 percent of its revenue to compensation and benefits. Excluding the British bonus tax it was forced to pay, the ratio drops to 48.8 percent.
''Everyone on the Street has a down revenue issue, but they have more of an issue because of all the hiring they have done as part of their rebuild,'' said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with the Japanese bank Nomura.
Michael S. Levine, a portfolio manager at OppenheimerFunds, which holds 1.5 million Morgan Stanley shares, said the firm had a struggle on its hands.
''The stock performance between Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs started to diverge in September and has yet to reverse, showing that the market remains impatient with Morgan on a number of issues, including compensation,'' he said.
However, he warned against reading too much into the high compensation in the third quarter. ''I think management will bounce back and compensation will be more aligned with shareholder interest going forward,'' he said.
At the conference in February, Mr. Gorman provided some details on his divisional compensation. He said a ''well-performing wealth management business,'' the division that houses a firm's retail brokerage force, should have a compensation and benefits ratio of about 55 percent.
An underperforming division will produce a ratio of 65 percent. In 2009, this division at Morgan Stanley posted a compensation ratio of 65 percent because of weaker-than-usual performance as well as severance and restructuring costs. For the first nine months of this year, this division had a compensation ratio of 63 percent. The compensation ratio in this unit tends to be higher because many brokers are given fixed payouts not tied to market swings.
A well-performing securities business, Mr. Gorman said, should have a compensation-to-revenue ratio in the mid 30s. In 2009, Morgan's institutional securities business posted a compensation ratio almost double that of 57 percent. In a nod to the progress Mr. Gorman has made here, this division's compensation ratio was running at 42 percent for the nine months ended Sept. 30. Excluding the money Morgan had to pay for Britain's bonus tax, the ratio comes in closer to 39 percent.
It is not known yet how deep the pay cuts will be. Mr. Gorman, for his part, earned $15 million in salary and bonus for his work as co-president in 2009. All but his base salary came in the form of deferred cash and stock.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Good Energy Subsidies, and Bad

 BODY:
Last-minute negotiations over the tax package could send America's energy policy in exactly the wrong direction. If budget-conscious Republicans have their way, tax credits for renewable energy sources like wind and solar power would be allowed to expire, while wasteful and unnecessary tax breaks for corn ethanol -- an environmentally dubious fuel supported by farm-state legislators of both parties -- would be extended. 
This would be a preposterous outcome at a time when the nation desperately needs new investment in clean energy as well as the jobs that go with it.
In a rare sighting of bipartisanship and good sense, 17 senators are calling for subsidies on corn ethanol to lapse, as scheduled, at the end of the year. If they are extended, as the industry and its lobbyists want, it will cost taxpayers $31 billion across the next five years.
Corn ethanol's environmental benefits also have been called into serious question. Some studies have found that corn ethanol, as presently produced, releases more greenhouse gases than petroleum fuels. The rush to convert food crops to fuel production also has contributed to spikes in food prices.
Meanwhile, two modest but useful tax incentives, also scheduled to expire on Dec. 31, should be renewed. Both were included in the 2008 stimulus bill. One provides tax credits -- technically, grants in lieu of credits -- for renewable energy projects like wind and solar. Extending this program would create thousands of new jobs. Allowing it to lapse would threaten two important industries struggling to meet foreign competition.
The second incentive is a manufacturing tax credit for companies that retool their factories to produce energy-efficient batteries and other clean-energy products. The $2.3 billion provided under this program was snapped up in a hurry, partly by rust-belt states desperate for new jobs.
Congress should keep the subsidies for renewable energy while jettisoning the subsidies for corn ethanol. That makes sense for the environment, the economy, and for American taxpayers.

HEADLINE: To Test Housing Program, Some Are Denied Aid

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
It has long been the standard practice in medical testing: Give drug treatment to one group while another, the control group, goes without.
Now, New York City is applying the same methodology to assess one of its programs to prevent homelessness. Half of the test subjects -- people who are behind on rent and in danger of being evicted -- are being denied assistance from the program for two years, with researchers tracking them to see if they end up homeless.
The city's Department of Homeless Services said the study was necessary to determine whether the $23 million program, called Homebase, helped the people for whom it was intended. Homebase, begun in 2004, offers job training, counseling services and emergency money to help people stay in their homes.
But some public officials and legal aid groups have denounced the study as unethical and cruel, and have called on the city to stop the study and to grant help to all the test subjects who had been denied assistance. 
''They should immediately stop this experiment,'' said the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer. ''The city shouldn't be making guinea pigs out of its most vulnerable.''
As controversial as the experiment has become, New York City is among a number of governments, philanthropies and research groups turning to so-called randomized controlled trials to evaluate social welfare programs.
The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development recently started an 18-month study in 10 cities and counties to track up to 3,000 families who land in homeless shelters. Families will be randomly assigned to programs that put them in homes, give them housing subsidies or allow them to stay in shelters. The goal, a HUD spokesman, Brian Sullivan, said, is to find out which approach most effectively ushered people into permanent homes.
Such trials, while not new, are becoming especially popular in developing countries. In India, for example, researchers using a controlled trial found that installing cameras in classrooms reduced teacher absenteeism at rural schools. Children given deworming treatment in Kenya ended up having better attendance at school and growing taller.
''It's a very effective way to find out what works and what doesn't,'' said Esther Duflo, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has advanced the testing of social programs in the third world. ''Everybody, every country, has a limited budget and wants to find out what programs are effective.''
The New York study involves monitoring 400 households that sought Homebase help between June and August. Two hundred were given the program's services, and 200 were not. Those denied help by Homebase were given the names of other agencies -- among them H.R.A. Job Centers, Housing Court Answers and Eviction Intervention Services -- from which they could seek assistance.
Advocates for the homeless said they were puzzled about why the trial was necessary, since the city proclaimed the Homebase program as ''highly successful'' in the September 2010 Mayor's Management Report, saying that over 90 percent of families that received help from Homebase did not end up in homeless shelters. One critic of the trial, Councilwoman Annabel Palma, is holding a General Welfare Committee hearing about the program on Thursday.
''I don't think homeless people in our time, or in any time, should be treated like lab rats,'' Ms. Palma said.
But Seth Diamond, commissioner of the Homeless Services Department, said that just because 90 percent of the families helped by Homebase stayed out of shelters did not mean it was Homebase that kept families in their homes. People who sought out Homebase might be resourceful to begin with, he said, and adept at patching together various means of housing help.
The department, Mr. Diamond added, had to cut $20 million from its budget in November, and federal stimulus money for Homebase will end in July 2012.
''This is about putting emotions aside,'' he said. ''When you're making decisions about millions of dollars and thousands of people's lives, you have to do this on data, and that is what this is about.''
The department is paying $577,000 for the study, which is being administered by the City University of New York along with the research firm Abt Associates, based in Cambridge, Mass. The firm's institutional review board concluded that the study was ethical for several reasons, said Mary Maguire, a spokeswoman for Abt: because it was not an entitlement, meaning it was not available to everyone; because it could not serve all of the people who applied for it; and because the control group had access to other services.
The firm also believed, she said, that such tests offered the ''most compelling evidence'' about how well a program worked.
Dennis P. Culhane, a professor of social welfare policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said the New York test was particularly valuable because there was widespread doubt about whether eviction-prevention programs really worked.
''There's no doubt you can find poor people in need, but there's no evidence that people who get this program's help would end up homeless without it,'' said Professor Culhane, who is working as a consultant on both the New York and HUD studies.
Professor Culhane added that people were routinely denied Homebase help anyway, and that the study was merely reorganizing who ended up in that pool. According to the city, 5,500 households receive full Homebase help each year, and an additional 1,500 are denied case management and rental assistance because money runs out.
Still, legal aid lawyers in New York said that apart from their opposition to the study's ethics, its timing was troubling because nowadays, there were fewer resources to go around.
Ian Davie, a lawyer with Legal Services NYC in the Bronx, said Homebase was often a family's last resort before eviction. One of his clients, Angie Almodovar, 27, a single mother who is pregnant with her third child, ended up in the study group denied Homebase assistance. ''I wanted to cry, honestly speaking,'' Ms. Almodovar said. ''Homebase at the time was my only hope.''
Ms. Almodovar said she was told when she sought help from Homebase that in order to apply, she had to enter a lottery that could result in her being denied assistance. She said she signed a letter indicating she understood. Five minutes after a caseworker typed her information into a computer, she learned she would not receive assistance from the program.
With Mr. Davie's help, she cobbled together money from the Coalition for the Homeless and a public-assistance grant to stay in her apartment. But Mr. Davie wondered what would become of those less able to navigate the system. ''She was the person who didn't fall through the cracks,'' Mr. Davie said of Ms. Almodovar. ''It's the people who don't have assistance that are the ones we really worry about.''

HEADLINE: Falling Off the Bandwagon

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Dear Answerperson: My boyfriend is a liberal Democrat and ever since the president announced his tax deal with the Republicans, he has been impossible to live with. First he burned his ''Audacity of Hope'' sweater. Then he began messing up the cat's litter box, claiming he needed to draw ''lines in the sand.'' Now he wants to call off our wedding because he says that when you put your trust in people, they break your heart.
Miserable Moderate 
Dear Miserable,
Ask your boyfriend if he would rather spend the entire holiday season wondering what Senator Joe Lieberman will do next and whether Olympia Snowe will vote for cloture. Then he will turn pale and offer to take you out for a nice dinner.
Answerperson
***********
Look on the bright side, Democratic base. You've been urging President Obama to get really mad. Ever since the inauguration, you've been waiting for him to take a stand, point fingers at the people who are blocking progress and demand that they get the heck out of the road.
And this week he did it! Yippee!
Of course the liberal Democrats did not really plan on his getting mad at the liberal Democrats. But you can't have everything.
''This isn't the politics of the moment. This has to do with what can we get done right now,'' the president said heatedly as he defended his tax deal with the Republicans against outrage from the Congressional left.
It takes a lot to make President Obama incoherent. I think the vision of trying to corral 60 votes in the Senate on the night before Christmas sent him over the brink.
The lame-duck Senate has been extremely busy not passing a range of legislation. The votes on two Democratic proposals to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for everybody but the rich were 53 to 37 and 53 to 36. Of course, under venerable Senate tradition, that means they failed entirely.
It was at that point that Obama announced a deal with the Republicans to salvage unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless and create a sort of ministimulus bill with tax cuts for everybody, including the working poor, besides the dreaded, hated giveaway to the undeserving wealthy.
''The American people are outraged!'' said Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He wanted the president to draw that line in the sand, let the unemployment benefits lapse, the tax code fall into limbo, and hold out until public opinion forced 60 votes to come around.
If you really wanted the American people to rally around no-tax-cuts-for-richies, shouldn't we have had this conversation before the election? It's a lot easier to send Washington a message at the polls than on a protest march in a sub-zero wind-chill factor.
No, we waited until now because the Senate leaders left the timing up to their members who were running for re-election, and the Democrats in question said they'd rather not have to go on the record.
O.K., I've got to admit it. I've fallen off the line-in-the-sand bandwagon.
For one thing, opposing the Obama-Republican deal puts you on the same side as Sarah Palin, who sent out one of her twitters from hell on the subject, and Christine O'Donnell, the former Senate candidate. At a Tea Party meeting on Dec. 7, O'Donnell announced that it was a day of sorrow and ''Tragedy comes in threes: Pearl Harbor, Elizabeth Edwards's passing and Barack Obama's announcement of extending the tax cuts, which is good, but also extending the unemployment benefits.''
(I am happy to note that O'Donnell has announced that she's got a book deal and a new political action committee. Really, I don't know what I'd do if she went away.)
Plus, the Senate has worn me down. The filibuster rule makes it impossible to do anything more difficult than passing rules against tainted food, and the Democrats have not made any serious attempt to get rid of the filibuster rule. So work around them, I say.
We have no idea if Obama's unheroic attempt to get a deal done is going to pass. The Democratic senators who totally failed to exempt the wealthy from a tax-cut extension are outraged at the president for giving up on them.
''This is beyond politics. This is about justice and doing what's right,'' said Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana as she slammed ''the almost, you know, moral corruptness'' of tax cuts for millionaires.
It was a stirring statement, and would have been even more so if Landrieu had not been one of the few Democrats who actually voted to put the tax cuts on the books in the first place in 2001. Senator Harry Reid has already warned that members of his caucus ''have concerns'' that will need to be addressed. He has one himself about legalizing online poker, a matter that the casino interests in his state of Nevada are very excited about.
So this is what it takes to put the drama in Obama.

HEADLINE: No Deficit of Courage

BYLINE: By JON MEACHAM. 
Jon Meacham, the author, most recently, of ''American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,'' is at work on a biography of , George H. W. Bush.

 BODY:
IS it, in fact, 1994-95 all over again? The atmospherics are certainly familiar. We have a Democratic president who appears to be tacking to the center to work with Republicans after being battered in the midterms. Jilted liberals, meanwhile, are left wondering how they could have been so blind about the man they had fallen for so hard.
The Clinton comparison has been much in the air after President Obama's deal to extend the George W. Bush-era tax cuts. But a more apt analogy for the present lies in 1990, not in 1994, and with George Herbert Walker Bush, not with William Jefferson Clinton. 
It was in 1990 that Mr. Bush broke one of the most celebrated promises in modern American politics --''Read my lips: no new taxes,'' as he put it in 1988 -- in order to control federal spending. In the same way that Mr. Obama struck his deal to secure lower tax rates for the middle-class and win an extension of unemployment benefits, Mr. Bush gave on tax rates to get ''pay as you go'' rules -- meaning that no further spending could be approved without compensating budget cuts or revenue increases. It was the beginning of the fiscal discipline that helped create the budget surpluses of the 1990s.
While Mr. Obama's immediate concern is stimulus and Mr. Bush's was deficit-reduction, both gave way on issues critical to the true believers within their parties. For Mr. Bush, it was political death. He had never been fully trusted by a Reaganite Republican base. Like Mr. Obama -- who is unhappy with his ''sanctimonious'' left wing -- Mr. Bush was no ideologue.
''I'm not going to be held up by campaign rhetoric,'' he wrote in his diary early in his term. ''If the facts change, I hope I'm smart enough to change, too.'' Mr. Bush privately said that he had no intention of being ''off in some ideological corner falling on my sword and keeping the country from moving forward.''
He knew that doing what he believed was in the country's best interest could cost him his job in 1992. ''Nobody is particularly happy with me,'' he said during the 1990 negotiations. ''The budget is a loser.''
But in real time, aware of the consequences, he made the best of the world as he found it. After his election loss to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bush wrote to Nicholas Brady, his Treasury secretary, that the budget deal would have helped him if the economy had strongly recovered. ''It didn't,'' Mr. Bush added, ''and I was the 'read my lips' liar -- over and over and over again. I heard it -- it killed us.'' With the base angry and so many others believing the economy was not getting better, Mr. Bush faced a primary challenge from the right by Patrick Buchanan and ultimately could not prevail against the combination of Bill Clinton and Ross Perot.
If you play out the 1990 analogy, Mr. Obama, like Mr. Bush, may be a one-term president. Mr. Clinton won re-election because of his political gifts and the improving economy and because he was fortunate in his Congressional foes. Mr. Bush did not have these advantages.
It is too soon to tell what will confront Mr. Obama. If his bill, with its middle-class tax benefits, stimulates the economy, then his compromise on a liberal article of faith may one day rank with Mr. Bush's courage under conservative fire.
There are worse things than losing re-election yet winning the good opinion of history. Don't be surprised if Mr. Obama makes that very point when he presents the Presidential Medals of Freedom next year. Among those the president has chosen to honor at the White House: a man from Houston, George Herbert Walker Bush.

HEADLINE: A Sound Trade Deal With South Korea

 BODY:
There are compelling reasons why Congress should approve a free trade agreement with South Korea. Here are two: South Korea is the 12th largest economy in the world and it is a strategic ally of the United States in a very dangerous neighborhood. 
Those arguments also held when President George W. Bush cut the deal in 2007. It was never voted on because of knee-jerk resistance from Democratic lawmakers and the fierce opposition of Ford and Chrysler. President Obama has gotten American car companies a better deal. We trust the new Congress will show more sense and approve the agreement.
The administration estimates that the deal will increase American exports to South Korea by at least $10 billion annually. It will open South Korea to American telecommunications and financial services firms, and it will slash tariffs on American farm goods.
The deal offers easier access here for South Korean carmakers and other manufacturers. But the new version will make it easier for American carmakers over there. They will get some respite from new South Korean fuel economy and carbon-emission standards and be allowed to export up to 25,000 vehicles that don't meet South Korean safety standards as long as they meet American ones.
American tariffs on imports of Korean vehicles will fall more slowly than agreed in 2007 and could be raised in case of an import surge, while South Korean tariffs will fall more quickly. In exchange, South Korea gained more time to cut tariffs on American pork, got better terms for business visas and more time to impose tougher patent restrictions on its makers of generic drugs.
American and South Korean negotiators failed to reach a deal in time for President Obama's visit to Seoul last month. Apparently, it took a North Korean artillery attack on the South to focus everybody's minds.
While some antitrade Democrats are likely to oppose the deal, the news from Congress is hopeful. The incoming Republican leadership in the House has embraced the deal. Important Democratic constituencies -- most notably the United Automobile Workers union, the automakers and much of the beef-exporting industry -- are on board.
Mr. Obama also needs to press Congress to approve Bush-era agreements with Colombia and Panama and work to revive global trade negotiations. More protectionism will weaken the chances of a global recovery. Mr. Obama needs to make that case here and abroad.

HEADLINE: Hackers Attack Sites Considered WikiLeaks Foes

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS and RAVI SOMAIYA; John Markoff and Ashlee Vance contributed reporting from San Francisco.

 BODY:
LONDON -- In a campaign that had some declaring the start of a ''cyberwar,'' hundreds of Internet activists mounted retaliatory attacks on Wednesday on the Web sites of multinational companies and other organizations they deemed hostile to the WikiLeaks antisecrecy organization and its jailed founder, Julian Assange.
Within 12 hours of a British judge's decision on Tuesday to deny Mr. Assange bail in a Swedish extradition case, attacks on the Web sites of WikiLeaks's ''enemies,'' as defined by the organization's impassioned supporters around the world, caused several corporate Web sites to become inaccessible or slow down markedly. 
Targets of the attacks, in which activists overwhelmed the sites with traffic, included the Web site of MasterCard, which had stopped processing donations for WikiLeaks; Amazon.com, which revoked the use of its computer servers; and PayPal, which stopped accepting donations for Mr. Assange's group. Visa.com was also affected by the attacks, as were the Web sites of the Swedish prosecutor's office and the lawyer representing the two women whose allegations of sexual misconduct are the basis of Sweden's extradition bid.
The Internet assaults underlined the growing reach of self-described ''cyberanarchists,'' antigovernment and anticorporate activists who have made an icon of Mr. Assange, a 39-year-old Australian.
The speed and range of the attacks also appeared to show the resilience of the backing among computer activists for Mr. Assange, who has appeared increasingly isolated in recent months amid the furor stoked by WikiLeaks's Web site posting of hundreds of thousands of secret Pentagon documents on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Mr. Assange has come under renewed attack in the past two weeks for posting the first tranche of a trove of 250,000 secret State Department cables that have exposed American diplomats' frank assessments of relations with many countries, forcing Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to express regret to world leaders and raising fears that they and other sources would become more reticent.
The New York Times and four other news organizations last week began publishing articles based on the archive of cables made available to them.
In recent months, some of Mr. Assange's closest associates in WikiLeaks abandoned him, calling him autocratic and capricious and accusing him of reneging on WikiLeaks's original pledge of impartiality to launch a concerted attack on the United States. He has been simultaneously fighting a remote battle with the Swedish prosecutors, who have sought his extradition for questioning on accusations of ''rape, sexual molestation and forceful coercion'' made by the Swedish women. Mr. Assange has denied any wrongdoing in the cases.
American officials have repeatedly said that they are reviewing possible criminal charges against Mr. Assange, a step that could lead to a bid to extradite him to the United States and confront him with having to fight for his freedom on two fronts.
The cyberattacks in Mr. Assange's defense appear to have been coordinated by Anonymous, a loosely affiliated group of activist computer hackers who have singled out other groups before, including the Church of Scientology. Last weekend, members of Anonymous vowed in two online manifestos to take revenge on any organization that lined up against WikiLeaks.
Anonymous claimed responsibility for the MasterCard attack in Web messages and, according to one activist associated with the group, conducted waves of attacks on other companies during the day. The group said the actions were part of an effort called Operation Payback, which began as a way of punishing companies that attempted to stop Internet file-sharing and movie downloads.
The activist, Gregg Housh, who disavows a personal role in any illegal online activity, said that 1,500 supporters had been in online forums and chat rooms organizing the mass ''denial of service'' attacks. His account was confirmed by Jose Nazario, a senior security researcher at Arbor Networks, a Chelmsford, Mass., firm that tracks malicious activity on computer networks.
Most of the corporations whose sites were targeted did not explain why they severed ties with WikiLeaks. But PayPal issued statements saying its decision was based on ''a violation'' of its policy on promoting illegal activities.
Almost all the corporate Web sites that were attacked appeared to be operating normally later on Wednesday, suggesting that any economic impact was limited. But the sense of an Internet war was reinforced when Netcraft, a British Internet monitoring firm, reported that the Web site being used by the hackers to distribute denial-of-service software had been suspended by a Dutch hosting firm, Leaseweb.
A sense of the belligerent mood among activists was given when one contributor to a forum the group uses, WhyWeProtest.net, wrote of the attacks: ''The war is on. And everyone ought to spend some time thinking about it, discussing it with others, preparing yourselves so you know how to act if something compels you to make a decision. Be very careful not to err on the side of inaction.''
Mr. Housh acknowledged that there had been online talk among the hackers of a possible Internet campaign against the two women who have been Mr. Assange's accusers in the Swedish case, but he said that ''a lot of people don't want to be involved.''
A Web search showed new blog posts in recent days in which the two women, identified by the Swedish prosecutors only as Ms. A. and Ms. W., were named, but it was not clear whether there was any link to Anonymous. The women have said that consensual sexual encounters with Mr. Assange became nonconsensual when condoms were no longer in use.
The cyberattacks on corporations Wednesday were seen by many supporters as a counterstrike against the United States. Mr. Assange's online supporters have widely condemned the Obama administration as the unseen hand coordinating efforts to choke off WikiLeaks by denying it financing and suppressing its network of computer servers.
Mr. Housh described Mr. Assange in an interview as ''a political prisoner,'' a common view among WikiLeaks supporters who have joined Mr. Assange in condemning the sexual abuse accusations as part of an American-inspired ''smear campaign.''
Another activist used the analogy of the civil rights struggle for the cyberattacks.
''Are they disrupting business?'' a contributor using the name Moryath wrote in a comment on the slashdot.org technology Web site. ''Perhaps, but no worse than the lunch counter sit-ins did.''

HEADLINE: Who Polices Wall Street?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Power of Failure'' (column, Nov. 27):
William D. Cohan writes of the potential of failure to instruct but misdiagnoses the problem at the core of the issue he raises. It's not the financial industry's responsibility to police its own behavior; it's ours. 
We the people hire government representatives to create and enforce laws to ensure that our society will survive and prosper. Nobody removes the ballast from a yacht then sails in it; it won't stay upright when the wind comes up. But stripping the ballast from public companies under the guise of ''creating shareholder value'' has been a way of life in American business since the 1980s.
There's a difference between AAA-rated bonds and junk, but the rating agencies that exist to tell us which is which are getting paid by the packagers of the products they're rating.
An absence of confidence in the economy is the only thing in this picture that makes sense. We have democracy to the extent that we've insisted on it. If we want functional capital markets and a sustainable economy, we're going to have to insist on that, too.
It's our job, not Wall Street's.

HEADLINE: Officer-Training Program Lags

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A high-priority Pentagon program to train a cadre of officers with special skills for the Afghan war has recovered from a number of start-up stumbles, but is still less than halfway to its numerical goal at the one-year mark, according to senior Pentagon officials. 
Under the ''Afghanistan-Pakistan Hands'' program, a pool of military officers receives about five months of specialized training and signs on for multiple tours, not just in combat roles but in governance, economic development and security training.
The effort was devised as an answer to criticism that the war effort essentially started from scratch every year with the arrival of each fresh rotation of officers. Intensive training in local languages is the heart of the program, along with courses in culture, politics and history.
But the effort suffered initially from a lack of volunteers and reluctant support from some corners of the military. Since then, the military has begun to offer career-building incentives to those who sign up, and to improve oversight over the project.
Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who a year ago wrote a stern memorandum rebuking the four armed services for not sending their best officers to a program he strongly supported, gave a somewhat more positive assessment when asked for an update.
''No really good initiative stays good without some work and some growing pains,'' he said in a statement. ''Afghan Hands is no exception. But that's the important thing to remember about it. It's growing and it's getting more viable and valuable every day.''
His criticism last year made clear to the military service chiefs that it was their responsibility to make certain that officers would find their chances for promotion enhanced, and not hurt, by committing to the unconventional career path.
To that end, the Army has instituted incentives for officers who choose the program: They will receive preferential consideration for assignments commanding battalions and brigades in Afghanistan. Another complaint heard from officers in the first group sent to Afghanistan was that local commanders would assign them to the crisis of the day, and not to a position tailored to their specialized training. An assignments cell has been set up in Afghanistan to better place new arrivals in the field, officials said.
The personnel target for the program is 750 people -- the vast majority in Afghanistan -- and the program is not quite halfway there, with 161 officers deployed; in addition, 186 are in training that includes learning the Dari, Pashto or Urdu languages, and a third wave await training.
When members finish their tours in the region, they will be assigned to positions that deal directly with issues in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in the Pentagon, at Central Command or elsewhere. They will rotate out to the war zone on their next assignment.

HEADLINE: OTB Closes Parlors, as Threatened, After State Senate Spurns a Rescue Plan

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
After more threats of extinction than anyone could remember, the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation unexpectedly made good on a threat of its own and closed the doors to its parlors on Tuesday night.
After the State Senate declined to pass an Assembly-approved bill designed to save the long-failing horse betting operation, Gov. David A. Paterson's handpicked leaders of the corporation carried out their shutdown.
About 50 parlors around the city were shuttered. Some 1,000 employees lost their jobs. And a revenue stream that had funneled tens of millions of dollars a year to breeders, track owners and related businesses dried up. 
Another piece of gritty old New York had gone the way of the Automat and the Times Square peep show.
Many had seen the latest threat as a bargaining chip to get lawmakers to act. Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had both threatened to close OTB before the city turned over the operation to the state in 2008. And the threat of closing has been repeatedly invoked since the corporation filed for bankruptcy last year.
Still, locking the doors came as such a shock that no one seemed certain of what would happen next. Some insiders still held out hope for a reversal, though the chances that the Legislature would take the required action dwindled by the hour.
''I guess it's never all over, but it's pretty close to it,'' said Steven Newman, an OTB board member. ''It's a sad day.''
Senate Republicans, who had offered a new bill this week that would give the other five regional OTBs the same savings on commissions to tracks that the city OTB would receive under the Assembly bill, said they still wanted to strike a bargain. But there were no signs of movement.
OTB's total bets, known as the handle, fell to just below $1 billion a year in recent years as other legal gambling options became increasingly available and as interest in racing waned. What was left from the handle -- after paying back 75 percent to winning bettors -- was still a major source of revenue, especially for upstate horse farms.
''New York City OTB represents about 45 percent or so of the handle in the state,'' said John D. Sabini, chairman of the State Racing and Wagering Board. ''In an industry that's having a tough time anyway in a tough economy, that's a huge, huge hit.''
Attendance at Aqueduct racetrack was up about 25 percent on Wednesday, to 2,651, compared to a Wednesday in early December 2009, according to the New York Racing Association. But total betting -- including off-track wagers -- on Aqueduct races was about the same as that day a year ago.
The wagering board, meanwhile, approved emergency measures intended to dissuade New York City horseplayers from seeking out-of-state wagering options on New York races. The changes will allow some track owners and regional OTBs to increase incentives for bettors and process account applications over the Internet, instead of requiring applicants to file in person.
The city's OTB operation was the first of its kind when it started in 1971. It carried the promise of taking the spoils of horse betting away from neighborhood bookmakers and channeling the profits to city services and the racing industry.
But problems quickly emerged. OTB became a patronage ground and infamous for loose spending. It was burdened by a requirement to pay the government's and racing industry's shares of the handle out of its gross receipts rather than with what was left after covering its expenses.
The city's operation was a trailblazer, but never a model to other states, ''because of what they perceived to be problems with New York City OTB,'' said Bennett Liebman, executive director of the Government Law Center at Albany Law School and a Paterson appointee to the New York Racing Association.
Other states eventually created systems in which the track owners or other businesses controlled off-track betting.
Some privatization of OTB remains possible. Track owners have long coveted OTB's Internet and telephone betting system. But as bettors clear out their accounts and days pass, that operation will also lose value.
''If they stay closed for one or two or three days, forget it, there's nothing left. It's a fragile asset to begin with,'' said Marc E. Richards, a lawyer with the firm of Blank Rome who is representing OTB's creditors in the bankruptcy case.
Closing costs have been estimated at $19 million, and pension and health benefits for retirees could climb above $600 million. Track owners seem less likely than ever to collect the $67 million they are owed, and the state would probably lose the $11 million it has coming.
OTB said it would keep three locations open through Monday to allow bettors to cash winnings and close out their accounts.
At one of those offices, at Seventh Avenue and 38th Street in Manhattan, about 20 men lined up when the first teller window opened at noon. Some of them shook their heads in disgust or shock. The television screens and betting machines were turned off.
''It's terrible,'' said John Grassley, 77, a retired postal worker who said he had been an OTB bettor since it began. ''I thought they would solve it at the last minute. They ought to privatize it, or turn it over to the Gambinos. Government can't run anything.''

HEADLINE: Prosecutors Stage a Sideshow, While the Big Tent Is Empty

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest.

 BODY:
You may have noticed that prosecutors are in something of a white-collar slump lately.
The stock options backdating prosecutions have largely been a bust, and not because it wasn't a true scandal. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department investigated more than 100 companies. Over 100 took accounting restatements. Yet only a handful of executives went to prison, with some prominent cases fizzling out. Prosecutors also stumbled in other high priority corporate fraud prosecutions, like the KPMG tax shelter and the stock-exchange specialists cases.
The most spectacular prosecutorial flameout was the case against the Bear Stearns hedge fund managers, including Ralph Cioffi. The consequences of that disaster are still reverberating. The United States attorney's office in Brooklyn rushed to haul low-level executives in front of a jury based on a few seemingly incriminating e-mails. The defense was easily able to convince jurors that these represented only out-of-context glimpses of fear as markets swooned, not a conspiracy to mislead. 
Now we have a supposedly new push: the insider trading scandal.
The United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, and United States Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. are hyping their efforts. ''Illegal insider trading is rampant and may even be on the rise,'' Mr. Bharara pronounced in a speech in October. The feds are raiding hedge funds and publicly celebrating their criminal investigations related to insider trading.
The story line is that Wall Street now lives in fear. Hedge fund managers' phones may be tapped, any stray remark is suspect and old trades are being exhumed so that the entrails can be examined.
In fact, plenty of people on Wall Street are happy about the investigation. The ones with clean consciences like the idea that the world of special access to favorable tips is being cleaned up.
But others are pleased for a different reason: They realize the investigation is a sideshow.
All the hype carries an air of defensiveness. Everyone is wondering: Where are the investigations related to the financial crisis?
John Hueston, a former lead Enron prosecutor, wonders, ''Have they committed the resources in the right place? Do these scandals warrant apparent national priority status?''
Nobody from Lehman, Merrill Lynch or Citigroup has been charged criminally with anything. No top executives at Bear Stearns have been indicted. All former American International Group executives are running free. No big mortgage company executive has had to face the law.
How about someone other than Fabrice Tourre, known as the Fabulous Fab, at Goldman Sachs? How could the Securities and Exchange Commission merely settle with Countrywide's Angelo Mozilo, and for a fraction of what he made as chief executive?
The world was almost brought low by the American banking system, and we are supposed to think that no one did anything wrong?
The most common explanation from lawyers for this bizarre state of affairs is that it's complicated to make criminal cases in corporate fraud. Getting a case that shows the wrongdoer acted with intent - and proving it to a jury - is difficult.
But, of course, Enron was complicated, too, and prosecutors got the big boys. Ken Lay was found guilty (he died before he served his time). Jeff Skilling is in prison, though the end result was bittersweet for prosecutors when much of his conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court. Bernie Ebbers of WorldCom and Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco are wearing stripes.
Sure, it takes time to investigate complicated cases. Many people think the S.E.C., at the least, will bring charges against top executives at Lehman Brothers. The huge, ground-breaking special examiner's report on Lehman laid bare problems with its accounting. But that report came out in March - on a bank that blew up more than two years ago. That seems awfully slow.
The most popular reason offered for the dearth of financial crisis prosecutions is the 100-year flood excuse: The banking system was hit by a systemic and unforeseeable disaster, which means that, as unpleasant as it may be to laymen, it's unlikely that anyone committed a crime.
Or, barring that wildly implausible explanation (because, indeed, many people saw the crash coming and warned about it), the argument is that acting stupidly and recklessly is no crime.
As I ride the subway every morning, I often fantasize about criminalizing stupidity and fecklessness. But alas, it's not to be.
Nevertheless, it's hardly reassuring that bankers, out of necessity, have universally adopted the dumb-rather-than-venal justification. That doesn't mean, however, that the rest of us need to buy it. It's shocking how pervasive and triumphant this narrative of the financial crisis has been.
Just as it's clear that not all bankers were guilty of crimes in the lead-up to the crisis, it strains credulity to contend no one was. Corporate crime is usually the act of desperate people who have initially made relatively innocent mistakes and then seek to cover them up. Some banks went down innocently. Surely some housed bad actors who broke laws.
As a society, we have the bankers we deserve. Sadly, it's looking as if we have the regulators and prosecutors we deserve, too.

PERSON: Heda Kovaly 

HEADLINE: Heda Kovaly Dies at 91; Wrote of Life Under Totalitarianism

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Heda Margolius Kovaly, a Czech writer and translator whose memoir, ''Under a Cruel Star,'' described her imprisonment by the Nazis during World War II and her persecution by the Communists in the 1950s and became a classic account of life under totalitarianism, died on Sunday at her home in Prague. She was 91.
Her death was confirmed by Helen Epstein, who edited and helped translate the revised edition of her memoir. 
Ms. Kovaly (pronounced KO-vah-lee), the daughter of prosperous Jews, found her world turned inside out with the German annexation of Czechoslovakia. With her family and her husband, Rudolf Margolius, she was deported to the Lodz ghetto in Poland in 1941 and then, in 1944, to Auschwitz, where her parents were sent to the gas chambers on their arrival.
After being moved to the Christianstadt forced labor camp and toiling in a secret munitions factory and a brickyard, she escaped from a column of prisoners being marched to Bergen-Belsen in early 1945.
She made her way back to Prague, where she reunited with her husband, who had survived both Auschwitz and Dachau and, under the Communist government of Klement Gottwald, rose to become a deputy minister of foreign trade.
In 1952, Mr. Margolius and 13 other government officials, including the former general secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Rudolf Slansky, were arrested and charged with conspiring against the state. All but two were Jewish, and all were found guilty in one of the era's most notorious show trials.
On Dec. 3, 1952, Mr. Margolius was hanged. His wife and their 4-year-old son, Ivan, were hounded by the state and shunned by society. Denied employment and thrown out of her apartment, she eked out a living doing translations under assumed names. In 1968, after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, she fled to Britain and then emigrated to the United States.
Mr. Margolius was officially, although secretly, rehabilitated in 1963. When filling out a form for the Ministry of Justice that asked her to report any losses inflicted by her husband's arrest and execution, Ms. Kovaly drew up a list that included ''loss of honor,'' ''loss of health'' and ''loss of faith in the Party and in justice.'' Only at the end of her 10-item list did she write ''loss of property.''
''I carry the past inside me like an accordion, like a book of picture postcards that people bring home as souvenirs from foreign cities, small and neat,'' she wrote in her memoir. ''But all it takes is to lift one corner of the top card for an endless snake to escape, zigzag joined to zigzag, the sign of the viper, and instantly all the pictures line up before my eyes.''
In his book ''Cultural Amnesia: Necessary Memories from History and the Arts,'' Clive James praised Ms. Kovaly's ''psychological penetration and terse style'' before bestowing a remarkable accolade. ''Given 30 seconds to recommend a single book that might start a serious student on the hard road to understanding the political tragedies of the 20th century,'' he wrote, ''I would choose this one.''
Heda Bloch was born on Sept. 15, 1919, in Prague, where her father was a plant manager and financial officer with Waldes Koh-i-Noor, a manufacturer of dress fasteners with branches around the world.
After surviving the torment of the camps, she returned to a homeland in political and economic turmoil. Unlike her husband, she took a skeptical view of Communism. It offered, she wrote in her memoir, ''such clear, simple answers to the most complex questions that I kept feeling there must be a mistake somewhere.''
Nevertheless, she and her husband joined the Communist Party in 1945. Mr. Margolius, after studying economics and working for an organization to rebuild Czechoslovakia's postwar industry, was offered a post in the ministry of foreign trade after the Communists assumed power in 1948.
She married Pavel Kovaly, a lecturer in philosophy, in 1955. Under his name, she translated German, British and American fiction into Czech and eventually became recognized as one of Czechoslovakia's leading literary translators, known for her renditions of novels by Arnold Zweig, Heinrich Boll, William Golding, Muriel Spark, Saul Bellow and Philip Roth. Her translations of Raymond Chandler inspired her to write a detective novel in Czech, ''Nevina'' (''Innocence'').
In 1963 she was summoned before the Central Committee of the Communist Party and shown a secret document exonerating her husband. She repudiated it angrily, demanding that her husband's name be cleared publicly, that each accusation against him be refuted one by one and that a full inquiry into the case be initiated. She spent the rest of her life pursuing that goal, without success.
After emigrating to the United States, where Mr. Kovaly had taken a teaching post at Northeastern University in 1967, she worked as a librarian at the Harvard University Law School. In 1996 the couple returned to Prague, where Mr. Kovaly died in 2006.
She is survived by her son, Ivan Margolius of London, and five grandchildren. Her son's family history, ''Reflections of Prague: Journeys Through the 20th Century,'' was published in 2006.
Ms. Kovaly's memoir was first published in 1973 as ''The Victors and the Vanquished,'' which contained a second memoir by Erazim Kohak. After being retranslated and edited by Ms. Epstein, Ms. Kovaly's work was reissued by Plunkett Lake Press in 1986 as ''Under a Cruel Star: A Life in Prague, 1941-1968,'' and published in Britain in 1988 under the title ''Prague Farewell.''
Alfred Kazin, reviewing the first edition of the book in The New York Times Book Review, wrote: ''This is an extraordinary memoir, so heartbreaking that I have reread it for months, unable to rise to the business of 'reviewing' less a book than a life repeatedly outraged by the worst totalitarians in Europe. Yet it is written with so much quiet respect for the minutiae of justice and truth that one does not know where and how to specify Heda Kovaly's splendidness as a human being.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Revises Report on Commercial Colleges

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
After reviewing 80 hours of videotapes by its undercover investigators, to remove personally identifiable information, the Government Accountability Office has revised its hard-hitting report on recruiting practices in for-profit higher education -- softening some of the findings but without changing its conclusion that the colleges visited had engaged in deception or fraud. 
''After the review of the tapes, we chose to issue the revised report to add more precise language and to clarify some aspects of the report,'' said Chuck Young, a spokesman for the G.A.O. ''But ultimately nothing has changed with the overall message of the report, and nothing has changed with any of our findings.''
The report, issued Aug. 4 at hearings on for-profit colleges by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, described undercover investigators' visits to 15 for-profit campuses, where they posed as prospective students and used hidden cameras to record admissions representatives. The colleges visited included branches of the University of Phoenix, Corinthian Colleges and Kaplan, a unit of The Washington Post Company.
Many changes were of little significance, but some did soften the findings of wrongdoing. For example, in a finding that a college representative told the undercover applicant that she ''should'' take out the maximum amount of federal loans, even if she did not need all the money, and that she ''should'' put the extra money in a high-interest savings account, the revised version makes it ''could'' instead.
In another, where the original report said the school representative told the undercover applicant that getting a job later was a ''piece of cake'' and said she had graduates making $120,00-$130,000 a year, the revised version added the representative's warning that in the current economic environment, $13 to $14 an hour would be a likely starting salary.
Given the highly partisan atmosphere surrounding the Senate committee's oversight hearings, and the Department of Education's continuing effort to tighten the rules governing for-profit colleges, the revisions themselves have become a charged political issue.
Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, the ranking Republican on the committee, who has been critical of the hearings, wrote to the G.A.O. on Tuesday, saying the revisions raised ''serious questions about the quality of rigor'' of the investigation and asking for a detailed explanation of each change. A spokesman for the Senate committee, however, said Wednesday that the updates did not change the substance of the report.

They have seen him charge around the bases and soar to snag fly balls that seemed destined to fall. They have seen him lead his team to the top of the standings.
''He's a difference maker for any club he goes to,'' Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said Wednesday. ''He changes the complexion of the game.'' 
The Boston Red Sox, of course, have seen the same things as the Yankees. And when Crawford reached an agreement to switch sides in the American League East late Wednesday night, he went with the Red Sox. The Yankees never made him an offer, and may live to regret their decision.
Crawford agreed to a contract with the Red Sox, according to a baseball official who was told of the deal. The official was granted anonymity so he could speak about another team's transaction. The Boston Globe was the first to report that Crawford would get $142 million for the next seven years.
The Crawford signing is the second megadeal by the Red Sox in the past week, coming days after their trade with the San Diego Padres for first baseman Adrian Gonzalez. With two moves -- and probably about $300 million, including the reported $160 million contract extension for Gonzalez -- the Red Sox have seized the favorite's spot in baseball's toughest division.
The Yankees had a chance to make this move. Instead of pursuing Cliff Lee, the Yankees could have tried to sign Crawford, then use left fielder Brett Gardner as part of a package to land starter Zack Greinke from the Kansas City Royals.
The Yankees had enough interest in Crawford for General Manager Brian Cashman to dine with Crawford and his agent, Brian Peters, on Tuesday night. But they determined they could not afford to sign Crawford while also trading for Greinke, who makes $27 million over the next two seasons.
So the Yankees believed it was wiser to stick with their existing outfield of Gardner, Curtis Granderson and Nick Swisher, which helped them lead the majors in runs scored last season. Why, then, were they entertaining Crawford only 24 hours before news broke of his agreement with Boston?
As baseball's economic superpower, the Yankees consider everything. And they guessed -- accurately, it seems -- that their presence in the Crawford talks could drive up his price for one of their rivals.
The Angels had seemed the most aggressive pursuers of Crawford. Their center fielder, Torii Hunter, had openly campaigned for him, and since losing Chone Figgins, the Angels have needed a dynamic producer at the top of their order. But apparently, Boston needed Crawford more.
In pulling off the moves for Gonzalez and Crawford, the Red Sox have done what they tried to do after the 2003 season: replace two superstars with two other superstars in the same off-season. Then, they tried to shed Nomar Garciaparra and Manny Ramirez and bring back, in separate deals, Magglio Ordonez and Alex Rodriguez. The plan failed when the union vetoed a restructuring of Rodriguez's contract.
This time -- once a formal contract is announced -- the Red Sox have done it. They have already let Victor Martinez sign with the Detroit Tigers, and they will not bring back Adrian Beltre, the All-Star free-agent third baseman. Both were dangerous hitters. But Gonzalez and Crawford should be much better, and neither has yet reached his 30th birthday.
The Red Sox still need to upgrade their bullpen. But with Josh Beckett, John Lackey, Jon Lester, Clay Buchholz and Daisuke Matsuzaka, their rotation is loaded.
Everything suggests that the balance of power in the division has shifted their way.
Tampa Bay won the East this past season, a game better than the Yankees, and the Rays will have the talented rookie Desmond Jennings to take over for Crawford. But they will miss him dearly, and they know it.
''I don't know that I'll really wrap my mind around that until spring training when he actually slaps you in the face -- or slaps you in the face with another team,'' Rays Manager Joe Maddon said on Wednesday, when asked about Crawford's pending departure. ''Listen, he's a good guy. He's a good player. He's earned this moment, and we all wish him well.''
The signing of Crawford, who becomes baseball's highest-paid outfielder, only increases the intense pressure on the Yankees to sign Lee. They have offered six years and about $140 million, a risky investment for a 32-year-old pitcher.
Deals of $100 million for pitchers rarely work out. Just ask the teams who invested in Kevin Brown, Mike Hampton and Barry Zito. There is considerable injury risk as pitchers move into their mid-30s, and if a control artist like Lee loses zip on his fastball, there is no telling how he would adjust.
But with a rotation of just C. C. Sabathia, Phil Hughes and A. J. Burnett, and perhaps Andy Pettitte, the Yankees really have no choice. They have to sign Lee. But even if they do, the Red Sox still look better.

HEADLINE: Smelling an Opportunity

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
MASON, Ohio -- For more than a decade, some of the nation's shrewdest marketers have tried to muscle in on the neighborhood dry cleaner, only to give up after years of labor and millions of dollars in investments.
Undeterred, Procter & Gamble is taking a shot at it, again. Having persuaded Americans to buy synthetic laundry detergent, fluorinated toothpaste and disposable diapers, P.& G. believes it has finally cracked the code on the dry cleaning business, too.
Where other dry cleaning entrepreneurs have tried to come up with clever business models for dry cleaning, P.& G.'s primary innovation is in the brand name itself: Tide Dry Cleaners, named after its best-selling laundry detergent.
With more than 800,000 Facebook fans and legions of loyal customers, Tide will draw people into the franchise stores, and superior service -- which includes drive-through service, 24-hour pickup and cleaning methods it markets as environmentally safer -- will keep them coming back, company officials predict. 
''The power of our brands represents disruptive innovation in these industries,'' said Nathan Estruth, vice president for FutureWorks, P.& G.'s entrepreneurial arm. ''Imagine getting to start my new business with the power of Tide.''
And the lure of its fragrance. P.& G. plans to infuse the stores and its dry cleaning fluids with the scent of the brand that's been cozily familiar to generations of households.
Among the Tide believers is Rick DeAngelis, a 40-year-old who is planning to open a franchise in suburban Cincinnati next year.
''It's been a trusted name in laundry for 60 years,'' he said. ''It's almost synonymous with laundry.''
Already, some local dry cleaners are complaining about the new gorilla on the block, backed by a corporation with roughly $80 billion in annual net sales.
Robert Tran, who owns Monroe Dry Cleaning here in Mason, said his business was off more than 50 percent since a new Tide store opened down the street at the end of October. Customers are being drawn to the Tide store by discounts and giveaways, like P.& G. products and gift cards, he said.
''There is no way I can afford that,'' he said. ''All my customers just left without giving me a chance to say, 'Hey, check the quality.' ''
But for Tide to become synonymous with dry cleaning too, P.& G. will have to overcome problems that have undone other upstarts. The dry cleaning industry has been roiled by unemployment and economic woes, and hurt by a continuing trend toward more casual work clothes.
Competition is fierce, and customers can be prickly: woe to the dry cleaner that ruins a favorite dress, even if it was cheaply made and bought decades ago.
Sanjiv Mehra, who oversaw a short-lived effort by Unilever to break into the dry cleaning business about a decade ago, said the key to success was figuring out a way to do it cheaper or significantly better than the mom-and-pop stores that dominate the industry. At the end of the day, Unilever decided that it couldn't do either.
''It comes back to, are you fundamentally changing the economics of the business?'' he said, adding that P.& G.'s marketing muscle could be the difference. ''That's where they will make a lot of money if they do this right.''
Payam Zamani, co-founder of Autoweb.com, a site for car buyers, who later founded PurpleTie dry cleaners, said he tried to do for dry cleaning what Blockbuster did for video stores, offering efficient and better quality than neighborhood dry cleaners. He said it was hard for his stores to compete with owner-operated stores with little overhead and low-wage employees.
''People were more interested in cheaper service, not better service,'' Mr. Zamani said.
P.& G. has dabbled in dry cleaning before. In the late 1990s it introduced Dryel, an at-home dry cleaning product that rattled local dry cleaners, who feared they would lose business. But Dryel was considered a disappointment, and P.& G. sold it in 2008.
In 2000, it opened several stores in suburban Atlanta, called Juvian, that offered at-home pickup and delivery of laundry and dry cleaning. The stores were eventually closed.
The idea for Tide Dry Cleaners came from P.& G.'s FutureWorks, a unit that comes up with ways to expand famous brands like Pampers, Oil of Olay and Crest.
Many of those brands are experiencing robust growth in developing markets, but finding new ways to increase revenue in saturated markets like the United States is more challenging.
Four years ago, FutureWorks began considering franchise opportunities, looking for industries where ownership was fragmented and consumers weren't satisfied. It came up with a three-inch binder of ideas.
The first one to get a green light? Car washes festooned with Mr. Clean, P.& G.'s popular cleaning product. There are now 16 Mr. Clean Car Washes, including one here in Mason that includes Wi-Fi, televisions and spray guns that children can aim at cars passing through the wash. Of course, Mr. Clean products are for sale too.
Dry cleaning, a roughly $8 billion-a-year industry, was second. Research showed that consumers thought the quality of dry cleaners was inconsistent, hours were inconvenient and prices rarely displayed. Plus, many dry cleaner stores were dingy, stifling hot and smelled of chemicals, not unlike a sweatshop, officials said.
Mr. Estruth said his team studied the failed efforts of others as it devised a business plan for Tide Dry Cleaners. The early results are promising: a pilot store in Kansas, outside Kansas City, generated more than $1 million in annual sales, roughly four times the industry average. There are now four Tide Dry Cleaners outlets with plans to expand in a dozen or so more markets.
''If we don't have compelling unit-level economics, it doesn't matter how strong the brand is,'' said William M. Van Epps, a former Papa John's Pizza executive who was hired to run P.& G.'s franchises. In a tour of a newly opened store in Mason, P.& G. officials explained why they believed they had resolved the dry cleaning issues that make consumers so unhappy.
At 3,000 square feet, the store is larger than most dry cleaners, and it is painted in Tide's distinctive orange hue. Cleaning is done on the premises, with Tide being used on garments that are laundered. Silicon-based detergents are used to dry-clean garments, though Tide's fragrance is added in the process.
Huge vents suck out heat and odors, keeping the store cool and smelling like -- what else? -- Tide.
The store is staffed with 15 to 18 employees, wearing Tide golf shirts. Lockers near the entrance allow customers to pick up and drop off clothes around the clock. Prices are displayed above the counter (a laundered shirt is $2.25; a dry-cleaned suit is $13, about average in the industry).
During a recent weekday, a steady stream of customers seemed willing to give the Tide store a try. In a positive omen for P.& G., several swooned over Tide.
''It smelled really good in there,'' said Harlan Smith, 42, who was on a business trip and dropped off some pants. ''When I think of Tide, I have so many good feelings. I'm surprised they didn't think of it sooner.''
Elena Hickman, 69, said she was lured to the store by a coupon.
''I wanted to see how and why they are doing it and compare it to my local store, which I have been visiting for 10, 11 years,'' she said. ''I like the drive-in and I like the service. It's very convenient if it's raining. The girls were very friendly. And I like the coupons, to be honest.''
Todd Krasnow, a former Staples executive, remembers the heady days when he opened his own dry cleaning chain in 1998. Called Zoots, it offered 24-hour pickup, drive-through service and environmentally friendly detergents, and it eventually grew to 70 stores.
But, as the economy soured, so did demand for dry cleaning, putting downward pressure on prices, he said. Consumers would take their business elsewhere or demand a refund if something was damaged, even if Zoots wasn't to blame.
''We underestimated what made it a truly challenging business,'' Mr. Krasnow said. ''Even if you did a really good job, there are plenty of problems.'' Zoots was eventually sold in 2008.
Mr. Krasnow, now a venture capitalist, said he still got a few calls a month from investors or recent business school graduates who believed they had found a way to make a killing in dry cleaning. He wishes them luck.
''People think it is easier to do it better,'' he said. ''And it's very, very difficult.''
Correction: December 10, 2010, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about Procter & Gamble's opening of a dry cleaning chain under the name of its Tide detergent brand described imprecisely the cleaning method it uses. While the ''Green Earth'' technology used at Tide Dry Cleaners is marketed as being environmentally better than perchloroethylene, a common dry cleaning solvent that is a likely carcinogen, it is not necessarily ''environmentally benign.'' (Some studies have found that silicone-based dry cleaning solvents like Green Earth persist in the environment in detectable amounts and have produced cancer in laboratory rats.)

HEADLINE: Oyster Creek Reactor To Be Closed by 2019

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Oyster Creek nuclear reactor in New Jersey will be shut down by 2019, at least 10 years before its license expires, in a deal with state environmental regulators that will allow it to operate until then without building costly cooling towers, its owner said on Wednesday.
Exelon Nuclear, which owns the reactor, in Lacey Township in Ocean County, has been negotiating with Gov. Chris Christie on the issue since he took office this year, said Exelon's chief nuclear officer, Christopher M. Crane. 
Installing cooling towers ''would cost us significantly more than the current value of the plant,'' Mr. Crane said in a telephone interview. Under Gov. Jon S. Corzine, the previous state administration had approved a draft environmental permit for the plant that would have required cooling towers so the plant would stop pumping hot water into Barnegat Bay.
The plant, the oldest operating power reactor in the United States, was built in 1969 by Jersey Central Power and Light Company. Exelon and a partner each bought a 50 percent share in 2000, and Exelon bought the partner out in 2002.
Exelon ended up buying the plant for about $10 million, and has spent about $100 million since 2000, Mr. Crane said. While the plant has been profitable, its small size and a weak market for electricity in a recession make additional major investments impractical, he said.
If expensive parts need to be replaced before 2019, he said, it might close before then.
Oyster Creek has about 700 employees, and Mr. Crane was en route to the plant on Wednesday night to talk to them. Exelon had planned an announcement on Thursday, but The Associated Press issued an article about the deal on Wednesday evening.
The governor's office declined to comment.
A similar debate over cooling towers is getting under way over the Indian Point reactors on the Hudson River in Buchanan, in Westchester County. Like Indian Point, Oyster Creek faces various foes, including some who worry about hot water discharges into the bay and others who oppose nuclear power in general.
At 630 megawatts, Oyster Creek was the first large-scale commercial reactor in the country. It survived a tortuous process to win a 20-year extension of its operating license in April 2009 from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In the late 1980s, operators discovered that it had suffered extensive corrosion in a steel liner, raising doubts about whether the reactor could survive an earthquake.
The commission granted the permit after lengthy engineering studies. The plant supplies about 6 percent of New Jersey's electricity.
While a 1954 law gives the federal government exclusive jurisdiction over nuclear safety, the states often enforce federal environmental laws within their borders, controlling aspects like water use permits. That is the basis on which New York State is trying to force Entergy, the owner of the Indian Point plants, to build cooling towers there.
Adding to the financial challenge of building cooling towers, such plants are struggling with a decline in demand for electricity, a plunge in wholesale prices and a surplus in generating capacity. What is more, the price of natural gas is low at the moment and is expected by many analysts to stay that way, making it a more attractive source of energy. Coal plants are also under pressure.
In Oyster Creek's case, the plant's relatively modest output also limits income. ''Its size is definitely a huge contributor'' to the decision, Mr. Crane said.
A near-twin of Oyster Creek, Vermont Yankee, may be closed in 2012 because the State of Vermont has refused to grant a permit the plant would require. Its owner, Entergy, has put the reactor up for sale, also noting that its small size limits its value.
After the Oyster Creek plant is shut by the end of 2019, Exelon will take about two years to put its components ''in layup'' but will not tear it down for at least 10 years after that, and possibly not for 60 years, Mr. Crane said. The company has accumulated $750 million for decommissioning, which he called adequate.
Exelon is the nation's largest nuclear operator, with 17 reactors.
There are 104 operable nuclear reactors in the United States. The last two to be retired was the Zion plant north of Chicago, built by Exelon's predecessor, Commonwealth Edison, and Millstone I, in Waterford, Conn., both in 1998.
Connecticut Yankee, in the town of Haddam Neck, closed in 1996, and Maine Yankee, in Wiscasset, in 1997.

HEADLINE: DEALBOOK ONLINE: SPIRITED SPLIT

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and JEFFREY CANE

 BODY:
Investors are hardly toasting the plan by Fortune Brands, maker of Jim Beam and Maker's Mark, to split into three businesses.
Shares of the consumer conglomerate were up only 1 percent at midday on Tuesday after Fortune Brands announced that it would focus on being a liquor company following a four-year strategic review. 
To be fair, the shares had already gained 18 percent since the disclosure on Oct. 7 that activist investor William A. Ackman had taken a 10.9 percent in the company, fueling speculation that he would push for a break-up.
Yet to take a metaphor from another of the company's three main business lines, analysts say the split will have more important consequences for investors: It will tee up the standalone companies for potential sales.
''We view this event as possibly only the first step in attaining the full underlying value of the [Fortune] portfolio by clearing most of the tax complexities involved with splitting the business into standalone entities,'' Jefferies noted on Wednesday.
The next step, the Jefferies analysts say, is ''sales of the standalone businesses to strategic buyers, particularly the spirits business, to perhaps one or more suitors.''
Because of its high margins, the spirits business is the most profitable one for Fortune and the most attractive to rivals.
While it is a giant in the United States, Fortune is a small player globally, with only a 4 percent of the market, according to research by Citigroup. Bigger rivals like Diageo and Bacardi have expressed interest in a spirits-only Fortune, according to people briefed on the matter.
Christine Farkas, an analyst with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, estimates an enterprise value for Fortune's spirits business at $9.5 billion, based on a multiple of 13 times Ebitda. She notes that takeout premiums for spirits have ranged from multiples of 12 times to 20 times Ebitda in recent years.
Under the plan approved in principle by its board, Fortune will spin off to shareholders its biggest business by revenue, the home and hardware lines, which include Moen faucets and Master locks. It will sell or spin off its gold brands, including Titleist. The spirits business will continue to operate under Fortune Brands.
Bruce Carbonari, Fortune's chief executive, said in a statement: ''While the breadth and balance of our portfolio have served shareholders very well, we see the potential for even greater value by separating our businesses into focused companies at a time when they have emerged from the economic downturn in such strong positions,''
The move won plaudits last night from Mr. Ackman.
''This is great news for the company and great news for the shareholders,'' he told DealBook in a telephone interview Tuesday night.
Fortune has held ''constructive'' conversations with the hedge fund manager, people briefed on the matter previously told DealBook. Still, during a presentation by Mr. Ackman to the company, the investor hinted that if Fortune dawdled, he could become more aggressive in pressing his case, including by waging a proxy fight.
Fortune is being advised by the investment banks Credit Suisse and Centerview Partners.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Europe Considers Prison Time for Financial Abuses

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Commission on Wednesday suggested mandatory prison terms for insider trading and other abuses as part of measures aimed at bolstering market confidence.
Many European Union countries have long resisted sending white-collar offenders to prison, as the United States does. But the Treaty of Lisbon, which took effect in December 2009, has widened the scope for Brussels to ask member nations to legislate on criminal matters.
''Traders and executives must realize that they won't get away with it and that the response will be tough,'' Michel Barnier, the European commissioner for financial services, said, referring to violations of financial services laws. 
Criminal sanctions could be applied ''to individuals responsible for violations,'' according to a European Union policy paper.
European governments would have to agree to Mr. Barnier's suggestion for jail terms if he includes it in his final proposals for ways to sanction market abuses, which is expected next year.
The suggestions to criminalize the most serious cases are part of a broader set of proposals intended to strengthen laws on banking, insurance and securities trading, where fines are considered too low, or penalties too weak, to deter wrongdoing.
Sony Kapoor, an adviser to a special European Parliament committee on the financial crisis, said Wednesday that raising ''the costs of financial malfeasance, including through mandatory prison terms, is necessary to counterbalance the astronomical rewards financial market actors can potentially reap by bending laws to the breaking point.''
European officials said there was a risk that weak enforcement in one of the bloc's 27 member states could undermine the stability and functioning of the financial system in another member, and that the severity of penalties and fines for market abuses varied widely across the bloc.
In the case of insider dealing, the maximum fines imposed by some countries, like Spain, Poland and Sweden are capped below 1 million euros, or $1.3 million, while only 12 countries impose sanctions corresponding to the amount earned from the violation, according to European officials.
Echoing Mr. Barnier's call for tougher treatment for market violators, Gunther Oettinger, the European commissioner for energy, made a separate proposal on Wednesday for more effective ways of detecting insider trading and other abuses aimed at gouging electricity and gas consumers.
Under those plans, monitors from the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, which starts operating next year, would have the authority to investigate whether, for example, power companies had taken bets on the prices of electricity and gas before letting other traders know that they planned to restrict supplies by shutting down plants for maintenance or other reasons.
But decisions on whether jail terms would apply to traders or employees rigging energy markets would be left to national governments, according to a spokeswoman for Mr. Oettinger.
Mr. Barnier's call for tougher action mirrors a similar debate in Europe over how best to stamp out cartels and price fixing.
Although some European countries have introduced criminal sanctions and prison terms for cartel offenses, enforcement has been patchy. Without the threat of jail terms in their arsenal, European Union regulators already are butting up against the maximum it can reasonably fine a company without driving it out of business.
Joaquin Almunia, the European competition commissioner, insisted Wednesday that cartel fines provided ''adequate deterrence.''
But Mr. Almunia added that he wanted to encourage civil litigation that could further penalize companies by enabling consumers and companies hurt by cartels to recover damages.
On Wednesday, Mr. Barnier also addressed so-called dark-pool trading, where the price of a deal is published only after it has happened. He said additional restrictions were required to improve transparency.
Describing as ''scandalous'' the speculation that had pushed up food prices, Mr. Barnier said regulators should be able to intervene in commodity markets to prevent undue volatility.
More rules also were needed, he said, on the number of orders that high-frequency securities traders can place.

HEADLINE: Budget Crisis Is Worse, California Legislators Are Told

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
SACRAMENTO -- After a month in which he kept a decidedly low profile, Jerry Brown, the governor-elect of California, emerged on Wednesday to preside over a glum two-hour conference with legislators devoted to making sure everyone realizes the severity of the state's fiscal crisis. By the end of the meeting -- an unrelenting barrage of gloom -- it was hard to figure out why Mr. Brown wanted this job in the first place.
The first thing he did was announce that things were even worse than everyone had said they were a week ago: the proposed change in the federal estate tax, in the deal worked out with President Obama and Congressional Republicans, has ramifications for the California estate tax, a $2.7 billion loss in revenue. That means the state now faces a $28.1 billion shortfall in revenue over the next 18 months. 
And as a cold rain fell outside the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium, the news -- delivered by state budget officials to an audience that included about 500 state and local legislators -- got progressively bleak. Unless something is done, California faces annual $20 billion deficits for at least the next five years. Unemployment will not return to pre-recession levels until 2015. And the title of one slide projected on the screen behind the panel? ''Worse next year than this year.''
Mr. Brown listened as state budget officials went through all the one-time budgetary maneuvers that have been exhausted in recent years to close previous gaps. ''That's why what we are looking at today is worse than it's ever been before,'' he said. ''And our opportunities to fix it are very limited.''
Mr. Brown seemed intent on using this forum to telegraph just how bad things are as he takes office, a common maneuver by an incoming chief executive that should give him some cover in the weeks ahead as he outlines what he has in mind to close the gap. This was a day more of explanation and amplification than, say, talking about what was to be done.
''Today we're not going to argue about solutions or do anything but try to get on the same page,'' he said. ''It's very hard to come to an agreement if there is no consensus on what the underlying problems are.''
For those looking for some insight into what kind of style Mr. Brown might bring to Sacramento in his return visit as governor, there were not many clues. He was, for the most part, as opaque as he had been in the campaign, other than pointing out just how bad things were.
The session over, he walked away from a crowd of reporters shouting questions. He steered clear when the Assembly speaker, John A. Perez, a Democrat, suggested that lawmakers needed to consider various measures to raise revenue -- that would be taxes -- to close the budget, drawing a quick rejoinder from Connie Conway, the Assembly Republican leader.
''I'm so glad we're not talking about solutions and raising taxes, because I know that's not what we are here for today,'' she said.
In the campaign, Mr. Brown had pledged that he would not raise taxes unless the idea was approved in a referendum by voters.
Still, with this budget summit, as Mr. Brown called it, there was a sense that a transition was finally at hand -- a transition that Mr. Brown, until now, had seemed in no rush to make before his swearing-in on Jan. 3.
And the sitting governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, has shown no sign of wanting to take a slide. In the past week, he led an emergency session of the Legislature, proposed a way to deal with part of the budget shortfall and made a dozen appointments. He also presided over the lighting of the Christmas tree outside the Capitol here.
Mr. Schwarzenegger's name was not heard in Wednesday's meeting.

HEADLINE: Mixing Drinks, Adding Class

BYLINE: By TIM MURPHY

 BODY:
HER studio apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is just shy of 400 square feet, barely enough room for an Ikea open-shelf bookcase, a chocolate-brown tufted couch, a full-size bed and her brindle-coated Shih Tzu, Charlie.
So when Claudia Argiro, 33, gave a holiday party last Saturday night, she pared down her guest list to about two dozen of her closest friends, hid the TV behind an industrial column wrapped with holiday lights and turned the media console into a bar.
But one thing she had to have was a bartender. ''I'm an adult now, living by myself, and this is my sh-bam, my moment,'' said Ms. Argiro, who runs a clothing boutique nearby called Charlie and Sam.
She called up Tealicious, a catering company in Queens, which sent over Eric Villani, a 33-year-old bartender, who was stationed in a two-foot-wide triangle in the middle of the room. For the next four hours, Mr. Villani stood there, not to make special cocktails, but to pour a vodka punch or a rum eggnog into clear plastic cups, trimmed with sugar-coated cherries and cinnamon sticks. 
His presence did not go unheralded in the apartment, in a new warehouse conversion along the Brooklyn waterfront, although the intimate cluster of guests could have easily served themselves. ''In my opinion, if you don't have a bartender at your party, you're a loser,'' said Dustin Terry, who lives a floor below Ms. Argiro and said his job was to get models and Saudi royalty into hot clubs. ''The bartender brings class and sophistication.''
''If you can't afford to hire a bartender,'' he added, ''you shouldn't be having a party.''
That seems to be the consensus of a growing crowd of 30-something New Yorkers who wish to signal they've graduated from post-collegiate squalor to young professional coming of age. No matter how small their abodes, they won't invite friends over for cocktails without the assistance of a bartender -- even if there's barely room for the bartender to stand.
Hired help telegraphs a new maturity and polish, said Marc Levine, who runs Premier Party Servers and Model Bartenders, which cater parties in New York and other cities. ''You're bringing your party to the next level, stepping away from the college kegger,'' he said, ''and actually entertaining in your New York City apartment.''
And there's a practical consideration. ''Hosts don't want to have to look after their guests' needs,'' said Matt Solan, a bartender who works many such small locations. ''But they also want a level of prestige.''
Mr. Levine estimates that the number of people calling him to book bartenders for extremely small apartments has gone up 20 percent in the last three years. ''With the recession, they don't want to rent an expensive loft space,'' he said. Instead, they are having house parties, he said, and hiring bartenders as a way to splurge within their means.
For four to five hours of work, as well as perhaps an hour of prep and cleanup, bartenders charge about $100 to $200. Bartenders can also expect a tip -- anywhere from 20 to 100 percent -- from the host, not the guests. (Putting out a tip jar, said Lyndsey Hamilton, a New York events planner, is a definite ''faux pas.'')
The job may also include helping the host clear tabletops throughout the night, answering the door and hanging up coats. Despite that, Mr. Solan said, ''People's expectations can be somewhat low,'' especially when the hosts are young and self-conscious about hiring help. ''They're happy when you just circulate, grabbing garbage,'' like dirty cups and cocktail napkins.
Such gigs can also carry minor humiliations that may not be so common at larger, more formal affairs. Mr. Solan once dressed up as a Roman king at a Halloween haunted-house party, where he periodically had to dodge a mechanized ax-murderer mannequin. David Shiovitz, who runs Columbia Bartending Agency, which sends out Columbia University undergraduates and graduate students, said that, were his bartenders asked, say, to strip or dance, ''They have the right to say, 'That's not in my contract,' '' he said.
There's also the challenge of making cocktails in a small, crowded space. Mr. Solan recalled a Halloween party with about 25 people in an 18-by-18-foot room. ''I was expected to work the room, based out of a little kitchen with a sink I filled with ice,'' he said.
Martin Mrowka, who owns Blue Bowtie, a small bartending company, had to work outside once. The West Village one-bedroom was so small that he had to serve drinks from a tiny balcony, under a tent, just in case it rained. (It didn't.)
In some ways, that claustrophobic feeling is inevitable for bartenders. ''Everyone is going to stand within a 10-foot-square radius of the liquor whether it's a 10,000-square-foot or 200-square-foot apartment,'' Mr. Levine said.
Luckily, things never became quite that crowded at Ms. Argiro's party. Her guests were an arty-chic crowd of D.J.s, stylists and publicists, as well as her brother, Marco, a Bushwick musician, and sister, Daniela. They munched on Ms. Argiro's homemade panko-crusted chicken bites and jalapeno poppers while dancing to tracks by the Cure, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Gorillaz.
At one point, Mr. Terry raided Ms. Argiro's private stash of tequila and entreated Mr. Villani to mix shots with fresh lime juice for him. Mr. Villani obliged. ''I'm a chameleon,'' said Mr. Villani, who has been bartending for 15 years. ''I can cater to Donald Trump or somebody in a rock band.''
The party cost Ms. Argiro about $600, of which $195 was for Mr. Villani's services. (Tealicious also supplied bar trimmings and an Italian holiday sponge cake filled with Nutella.) Mr. Villani was also given $80 in tips.
For Ms. Argiro, it was worth every penny. The bartender added what she called a chic, ''Mad Men'' vibe to the party. In fact, she said she'd just seen the movie, ''A Single Man,'' set in the mid-1960s, and had chosen her party dress -- a floaty, sleeveless black silk and chiffon minidress -- to channel Julianne Moore in that film.
Another guest, Eric Carson, 32, a stock trader who lives in nearby Greenpoint, agreed that the bartender added class. ''I feel very sophisticated at this party,'' he said. ''And I usually feel like a complete dirt bag.''
Correction: December 16, 2010, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Thursday about hiring bartenders for private parties misstated the name of an agency that sends out Columbia University undergraduates and graduate students as bartenders. It is the Columbia Bartending Agency, not Columbia Bartenders.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASE; Surviving Hitler and Stalin to Fight Poverty and Cancer

BYLINE: By EWA KERN-JEDRYCHOWSKA

 BODY:
For Larisa Shchetinina, now 72, the decision to leave Ukraine -- though not the act itself -- came suddenly. In 1992, she went to Kiev to say goodbye to her brother, who was moving to Israel. In the center of the country's capital she saw graffiti on a wall that read, in large letters: ''Let's drown Russians in Jewish blood.''
She and her husband, Victor, 73, survived Hitler and Stalin, tough postwar years and the challenges of perestroika. In the early 1990s, they faced the consequences of the Soviet Union's collapse and the birth of post-Soviet Ukraine.
''I'm Jewish, and my husband is Russian,'' Ms. Shchetinina said with a heavy accent, carefully choosing words from her rudimentary English vocabulary. ''We both felt unwanted.'' 
Their older son left for the United States first. When they arrived with the younger one as refugees in 2002, Ms. Shchetinina was 64, her husband 65. They spoke no English. But they hoped their life would improve. They settled in a one-bedroom apartment in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.
It turned out they had another hardship to beat: cancer. Last year Ms. Shchetinina had surgery for melanoma. In 2006, Mr. Shchetinin had prostate cancer and thought he had beaten it. But soon the disease took over his lungs, and it has recently spread to his bones. His prospects are dire, but he trusts the American health care system.
''In Ukraine, I would be dead long time ago,'' Mr. Shchetinin said.
Living on a fixed income is another challenge. After all their expenses, they have $30 left for the month. But they are used to poverty.
In 1941, when Ms. Shchetinina was 3, she was evacuated with her family from Lugansk in Ukraine to the Ural Mountains, where they stayed for four years. ''We slept in bunk beds, like in prison,'' she recalled. She remembered having only one toy in her childhood, a puppet her mother had sewn for her.
Mr. Shchetinin was born in 1937 in a political camp in Kazakhstan and lived there for eight years. His family had been taken there in a cattle train in 1930 after the Red Army confiscated their home. Dropped in the middle of a plain, they had to dig ditches to make a place to live. One of Mr. Shchetinin's two sisters died there.
The Shchetinins met in Lugansk, where they both studied mathematics at the Pedagogical Institute. They became math teachers, and Mr. Shchetinin later received a Ph.D. and worked as a professor at Lugansk University. Their life was very humble, they said, and the changes in the political system in the early 1990s brought further hardships. ''There were no jobs,'' Mr. Shchetinin recalled. ''Our children had no future.''
When they came to the United States, they brought many old documents and pictures, ''to keep memories alive.''
They remind them of their youth, but also of family tragedies. ''Here are my father's parents,'' Ms. Shchetinina said, pointing at one old photo, her voice trembling. ''The Nazis burned them in Babruysk in Belarus. They didn't have a chance to escape.''
The Shchetinins keep themselves busy. Their bookshelves are filled with English textbooks, tools for improving their language skills, and books for their four grandchildren. They help the younger ones with homework and take care of them when their parents cannot. Their eldest grandchild, 21-year-old Anna, is a student at Hunter College, Mr. Shchetinin noted with pride.
The Shchetinins' sons live close by and do their best to help financially. But the current economy makes it challenging.
As of now, both Shchetinins receive Supplemental Security Income; their combined monthly income is $1,115. (When they emigrated, they explained, they had to sign away the rights to their pensions for two lifetimes of work in the Soviet Union and Ukraine.) They also get $367 a month in food stamps. Their biggest expense is the rent: $872. When they became American citizens in 2007, the couple applied for a Section 8 housing subsidy. But they are still waiting for a decision.
In the meantime, they got help at the Edith and Carl Marks Jewish Community House of Bensonhurst, a beneficiary of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Between 2008 and early 2010 they received $50 a month from a fund for Holocaust survivors created by Dr. Robert Ivker after he read a Neediest Cases article in The Times about a caseworker who helped Nazi victims at the Marks J.C.H. In all, the Shchetinins received $1,450 from the fund, which they used for necessities, like food and vitamins to support Mr. Shchetinin's fight with cancer.
But the fund is now depleted, and the Shchetinins' financial situation has deteriorated. Nevertheless, they said, they felt blessed to be surrounded by their family and to have each other.
''I met her at a party at the Pedagogical Institute on December 16th, 1956,'' Mr. Shchetinin recalled. ''It was love from the first sight.''
Last year they celebrated their golden anniversary.
HOW TO HELP: Checks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund may be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Setbacks in Women's Health

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
More women are binge drinking, saying they downed five or more drinks at a single occasion in the past month, and fewer are being screened for cervical cancer. Over all, more women are obese, diabetic and hypertensive than just a few years ago, and more are testing positive for chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease linked to infertility.
The latest health report card for women, issued on Thursday by the National Women's Law Center and Oregon Health and Science University, paints a dismal picture, giving the United States an overall general grade of Unsatisfactory, with many F's on specific goals set by the government's Healthy People 2010 initiative. 
''The takeaway message is that we're really not where we should be,'' said Dr. Michelle Berlin, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Oregon Health and Science University School of Medicine and associate director of the university's Center for Women's Health. ''We've had 10 years of doing this report card, and you would hope the needle would have moved more than it has.''
While screening rates for colorectal cancer and high cholesterol have improved since the last report card was issued in 2007, and fewer women are smoking and dying of stroke or coronary heart disease, obesity continues to be a growing problem, with 26.4 percent of women considered obese, up from 24 percent in 2007. The objective of Healthy People 2010 is to reduce that rate to 15 percent.
''It's boring but it's true,'' Dr. Berlin said, noting that one-quarter of women are sedentary and get no leisure-time physical activity at all, and that the vast majority do not eat five fruits and vegetables a day.
The report card is the fifth issued since 2000, and it grades and ranks states and the District of Columbia on 26 health-status indicators, depending on how close they came to achieving goals set by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, with more general assessments on dozens of policy indicators, like whether state laws require insurance coverage of mammography or whether their Medicaid program covers smoking cessation.
Vermont and Massachusetts ranked highest on health status and were the only states to get the grade of Satisfactory Minus; Louisiana and Mississippi were 50th and 51st, respectively. New York ranked 22nd, and was among 37 states that drew an Unsatisfactory grade.
California and New Jersey ranked highest on state health policies; Idaho and South Dakota were at the bottom of the list.
Judy Waxman, vice president of health and reproductive rights at the National Women's Law Center, said the new health care overhaul law had the potential to sharply improve women's health through its myriad provisions, which expand Medicaid eligibility and bar gender rating on health insurance policies. The sharp increase in binge drinking, a behavior not commonly associated with women, was one of the report's surprises: More than one in 10 women reported having had five or more drinks on at least one occasion in the last month, up from 6.7 percent in the 2007 report.
''This is very concerning especially when we think about what other things can happen when people engage in binge drinking: there are more sexual-assault problems, they're more likely to acquire an S.T.D., and more likely to have accidents while driving,'' Dr. Berlin said, suggesting the increase might reflect poor mental health and depression resulting from economic insecurity or unemployment.
She was at a loss to explain the drop in cervical cancer screening: 78 percent of women ages 18 to 64 had a pap smear in the last three years, down from 84.8 percent in 2007. The Healthy People 2010 goal is 90 percent.
While the increase in chlamydia infections might simply reflect more women being tested, Dr. Berlin said the drop in cervical cancer screening was disconcerting and might reflect either loss of health coverage or confusion over changing guidelines and the new vaccine (women who have been vaccinated must continue to have pap tests).

HEADLINE: 2 Unions' Backing Helps Chances of Trade Pact With South Korea

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
An unusual split in the labor movement has developed over President Obama's proposed free-trade pact with South Korea, with two powerful unions backing the deal -- a development that experts say will make Congressional ratification far more likely.
The United Automobile Workers are pleased that the agreement will increase auto exports to Korea, and the United Food and Commercial Workers are encouraged that the pact will bolster meat exports to Korea. Both have embraced the deal, which is a modified version of an agreement that President George W. Bush first negotiated in 2007.
By supporting the agreement, the two unions are breaking with organized labor's traditional opposition to free-trade agreements as a threat to American jobs. The machinists' union has denounced the Korea deal, while two other powerful unions, the steelworkers and the communications workers, will announce their opposition on Thursday, union officials say.
Some trade experts say that the support of the autoworkers and the food and commercial workers is likely to sway enough Democrats in the House and Senate to ensure ratification. The agreement is also subject to approval by South Korea's National Assembly. 
''The ratification chances for the Korean agreement are extremely good because you now have a split in labor,'' said Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
Mr. Hufbauer said it was unusual for labor to be so divided over a trade agreement. Unified labor opposition has helped block ratification of trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and, until now, South Korea.
But facing pressure from the autoworkers and other unions, Mr. Obama pressed South Korea to renegotiate important provisions in the 2007 accord. The revised deal would reduce tariffs and other trade restrictions on American auto and beef exports and continue American tariffs on Korean cars and trucks for an extended period.
The U.A.W.'s president, Bob King, praised the agreement, saying it would significantly expand American auto exports to South Korea.
''I'm supporting this because I think it's in the best interests of our members and in the best interests of our country,'' he said in an interview on Wednesday. ''The most important thing for the economic well-being of the U.S. is to protect jobs and create jobs, and I think this agreement will do that.''
The autoworkers are pleased that the deal keeps a 2.5 percent American tariff on Korean autos for four years and a 25 percent tariff on Korean sport utility vehicles for six years rather than lifting them immediately, as the 2007 accord called for.
Korea, meanwhile, will immediately cut its tariff on American auto imports in half, to 4 percent, while allowing in 75,000 American cars each year that meet American safety standards, even if they do not meet Korean safety standards.
Mr. King said the Obama administration had taken labor's concerns into account more than any administration had in negotiating any previous trade agreement.
The United States had a $6.6 billion merchandise trade deficit with South Korea in the first nine months of this year, according to the Census Bureau, importing $35.5 billion in goods while exporting $28.9 billion worth. In a study, the U.A.W. said there was an $8.9 billion trade deficit in automobiles with Korea last year, representing 70 percent of the bilateral trade deficit.
Denunciation of the U.A.W. by other unions and antitrade activists has been unusually harsh.
Jane Hamsher, a prominent left-wing blogger who founded Firedoglake, wrote that the U.A.W. was ''a bunch of selfish pigs'' for embracing the agreement and was a ''Chinese-style union'' that was ''much closer to the interests of management and the government than those of its line workers.'' She asserted that the U.A.W. embraced the accord in part to thank President Obama for rescuing General Motors and Chrysler.
The nation's main labor federation, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., is usually quick to denounce trade agreements, but so far it has been silent about the Korean pact, apparently because of the disagreement among its member unions.
Several union officials said, however, that the A.F.L-C.I.O. would issue a statement early Thursday criticizing the Korean deal, in particular for not doing more to protect the rights of workers to unionize in both South Korea and the United States.
The Obama administration has hailed the agreement, which comes as the United States is showing support for South Korea after North Korea shelled a South Korean island, killing four people. The administration says the trade pact will further its goal of doubling exports within five years, while opening up South Korea's $560 billion services market.
The administration pointed to a study by the International Trade Commission that predicted that American merchandise exports to Korea would increase to around $11 billion a year as a result of the agreement, while merchandise imports from Korea would grow about $6.7 billion.
Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and a highly influential voice among Democrats on trade, praised the agreement, calling it ''a dramatic step toward changing from a one-way street to a two-way street for trade between the U.S. and South Korea.''
But some of the Democrats' traditional union allies are unconvinced.
Thomas Buffenbarger, president of the International Association of Machinists, voiced concern that the agreement would increase imports of aircraft components from Korea, endangering the jobs of his union's members. ''We see it as just a repeat of Nafta,'' he said, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement, ratified in 1993, which removed many trade barriers among the United States, Mexico and Canada.
Mr. Buffenbarger said that the Korea agreement, like Nafta, promoted free trade, but not fair trade, by increasing imports made by lower-paid workers in other countries. ''It helps corporations, but it really doesn't help workers,'' he said.
Some South Koreans are worried, too. Farmers there held a protest this week over the deal. The earlier version also drew opposition from Korean unions.
The Obama administration said the deal would help America's farmers and ranchers by, among other things, eliminating Korea's 40 percent tariff on beef imports.
The reduced tariffs on beef helped persuade the United Food and Commercial Workers to embrace the pact. ''Academics estimate that the Korean agreement will create over 20,000 jobs in the U.S. meat export-producing sectors that employ hundreds of thousands of U.F.C.W. members,'' the union said.
It also praised the deal for creating ''a more level playing field'' for the American auto industry.
Correction: December 11, 2010, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the backing of the United Automobile Workers and the United Food and Commercial Workers for a free-trade pact with South Korea misstated the amount of American exports to South Korea in the first nine months of this year. It was $28.9 billion, not million.

HEADLINE: In Tax Deal, Many Public Employees To Pay More

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
More bad news for government workers.
At a time when state and local governments across the country are imposing furloughs and layoffs, and President Obama has frozen pay for federal employees, it turns out that one of the few groups to face higher federal taxes next year may be public sector employees.
The proposal to extend the Bush-era tax breaks unveiled by Mr. Obama this week would offer a tax cut for most Americans. The deal would end the Making Work Pay credit, which gave a tax reduction of up to $400 to workers with low and middle incomes. That credit will be replaced by a 2 percentage point decrease in the payroll tax for Social Security for people of all incomes. 
But more than six million federal, state and local government employees do not pay into Social Security at all. Instead, they pay into public pension systems. So if the agreed proposal becomes law, such employees will lose the $400 credit and would not reap any benefit from the payroll tax cut.
According to the most recent statistics by the House Ways and Means Committee, more than 174 million workers paid into Social Security in 2007, but about 5.7 million state and local government employees paid into other pension systems. While the federal government has been moving its work force into Social Security in recent decades, there were still 600,000 employees excluded from it in 2007.
Some tax experts say that it is unfair for a $900 billion tax cut package to give a quarter of its benefits to the top 1 percent of wage earners while forcing public sector workers, who are largely middle class, to have to pay more.
''It makes so little sense that you have to hope that the people who negotiated this didn't think it through,'' said Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a public interest group aligned with unions. ''And when they do think it through, they'll realize it's not fair. It would be cruel not to do something about it.''
Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman, acknowledged that the current version of the plan could result in a higher tax bill in 2011 than 2010 for some government workers. But she stressed that the plan would nonetheless spare them, and all taxpayers, a much steeper increase that would have resulted if no deal had been struck and all the Bush tax cuts were allowed to expire on Dec. 31.
While Mr. Obama had proposed an extension of the Making Work Pay credit, the $120 billion payroll tax reduction worked out is twice as large and will offer a break of up to $2,136 each to millions of middle- and high-income taxpayers.
''The payroll tax cut would reduce taxes for over 155 million workers, providing effective tax relief that will create jobs and boost the economy,'' Ms. Brundage said.
While many Democrats have criticized Mr. Obama for abandoning a campaign pledge to let the cuts expire on the wealthiest 2 percent of wage earners, Ms. Brundage said that the president did so only after winning the extension of an assortment of credits for low-income Americans and a 13-month extension of unemployment benefits.
''The cumulative impact of these provisions will be good for America's working families and our economy,'' Ms. Brundage said.
Leaders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees were muted in their reaction to the prospect of more taxes for public employees.
The union spent $90 million to help elect Democrats during the last election cycle, when Mr. Obama promoted a plan to preserve tax cuts for all but the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. But Democratic leaders in Congress declined to vote on the measure before the elections and, after Republicans won control of the House, could not win approval for it during the lame duck session of Congress.
''We are aware of it,'' said Gregory King, a union spokesman, ''and we are discussing it with the appropriate leaders in Congress.''

HEADLINE: Strike May Be Watershed Event in Spain

BYLINE: By RAPHAEL MINDER; Nicola Clark contributed reporting from Paris, and Jad Mouawad from New York.

 BODY:
MADRID -- When Spanish air traffic controllers conducted a wildcat strike over the weekend that shut down airports across the country, they were hoping to force the government to back down from its plans to cut their pay, increase their regular working hours and put Spain's two largest airports under private management.
Instead, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero declared a state of alarm and forced the controllers back to work under military authority, and the controllers' union ended up apologizing for its actions. In a country with a strong labor movement that is usually tolerant of wildcat strikes, the confrontation has been hailed as a potential watershed event along the lines of President Ronald Reagan's firing of air traffic controllers in 1981. 
Whatever the historical fallout, it was immediately clear that the controllers' timing was poor. With Spain reeling under 20 percent unemployment and facing further austerity measures in response to the European debt crisis, very few Spaniards could gin up much sympathy for workers who were making, on average, $463,000 a year, with some making as much as $1.29 million.
The controllers' supporters noted that their counterparts throughout the world tend to earn high salaries. German controllers, for example, earn an average of about $200,000 a year, British controllers around $160,000. In the United States, the average annual salary was $109,218 in March 2009.
But even granting that, critics said, Spanish air traffic controllers are in a league of their own.
The fancy salaries stem from a 1999 collective-bargaining agreement, which limited regular working hours and richly rewarded additional shifts.
At the same time, the number of controllers had been held at about 2,400, even as the workload rose sharply as Spain expanded its network of airports during a decade-long construction boom. But around 500 controllers have taken early retirement or are on extended sick leave, reducing the work force to 1,900.
By comparison, France has about 4,000 controllers, monitoring less of the European airspace than their Spanish counterparts.
Controllers place blame for the low staffing levels on Aena, the state-controlled airport management authority.
''It has worked out cheaper for Aena to pay excess hours than to hire more people and also pay for two years of expensive training,'' said Daniel Zamit, a controller and former spokesman for the union. ''Those who earn a lot also work a lot, and if somebody can earn almost one million euros, it's not a sign of abuse but of an excessive and potentially dangerous work regime.''
Aena, in an e-mailed response to questions, insisted that ''the problem is not lack of staff but low productivity.'' Aena cited a study from Eurocontrol, the air traffic agency, showing that controllers' work productivity in other European nations rose 12.5 percent between 2003 and 2007 while falling 1 percent in Spain.
Critics of Spain's powerful unions say the difference between Spanish controllers and their counterparts elsewhere reflects a larger disparity in the power of organized labor.
''This should be an opportunity for a major overhaul that goes well beyond the dispute with controllers,'' said Sandalio Gomez, professor of labor relations at the IESE business school in Madrid.
In this instance, a previously beleaguered Mr. Zapatero seems to have won widespread support for his tough response. When he appears before Parliament on Thursday to defend his decision, he is not expected to face the criticism that such a move would have engendered in years past.

HEADLINE: Rule Makers Emerge From the Shadows

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Federal rule makers, long the neglected stepchildren of Washington bureaucrats, suddenly find themselves at the center of power as they scramble to work out details of hundreds of sweeping financial and health care regulations that will ultimately affect most Americans.
In Bethesda, Md., more than 200 health regulators working on complicated insurance rules have taken over three floors of a suburban office building, paying almost double the market rate for the space in their rush to get started.
Executives from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have been meeting almost daily with financial rule makers to air concerns about regulations they say threaten to curtail commerce.
And at the White House, senior officials receive several status reports a week on a process that all sides agree has vast implications for the country as a whole and for the Obama administration's political fortunes. 
The boom in rule-making -- the bureaucratic term for the nitty-gritty of drafting regulations -- is a result of the mega-bills approved by Congress this year at the urging of President Obama: the health care bill signed into law in March, and the financial overhaul law signed in July.
''There has never been a period like what we are going through now, in terms of the sheer volume and complexity of rule-making,'' said Paul Dennett, senior vice president of the American Benefits Council, a trade group for large employers.
And what was already shaping up as a rancorous lobbying battle over the rules is likely to become more contentious when Republicans take control of the House, having been swept to power on a pledge to influence health care and financial regulation.
At the very least, Republicans will be able to hold public hearings to spotlight financial regulations they see as too restrictive and health care rules they see as too disruptive, and they could pressure regulators to soften them.
The debate over federal spending has already slowed the development of financial rules, as hundreds of new rule-making positions have gone unfilled because of a lack of new financing.
Congress provided a road map for measures aimed broadly at getting more Americans covered by health insurance and providing more federal safeguards against risky financial practices. But the laws were so broad and complex that executive-branch regulators have wide leeway in determining what the rules should say and how they should be carried out.
In all, the bills call for drafting more than 300 separate rules on a rolling schedule by about 2014, plus dozens of other studies and periodic reports. That may be only the beginning. A recent report from the Congressional Research Service said the publication of rules under the health care law could stretch out for decades to come.
Regulators at various agencies are trying to answer questions like these:
How much should a credit-card company be able to charge a shopkeeper for administrative fees when you swipe your card for a purchase?
Which types of financial companies are so ''systemically important'' to the overall economy that they should be subject to greater federal oversight?
What services must be covered by all insurers as part of the ''essential health benefits'' package? And at what point would an increase in an insurer's premiums be considered so ''unreasonable'' that state and federal regulators could step in?
These and many other questions are now in the hands of government lawyers, doctors, bankers, accountants, actuaries and other regulatory specialists. With the rules spread across agencies, no one is certain how many employees are working on them, but the number is certainly in the hundreds or higher.
At the Federal Reserve, for instance, most of more than 50 lawyers in the legal division are now spending significant parts of their days on rule-making issues, like the question of how to carry out and enforce the so-called Volcker Rule, named for Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, restricting banks from making certain types of speculative investments.
No longer are these considered arcane questions that draw scrutiny only from the few Washingtonians who read the ''notices of proposed rule-making'' in the Federal Register.
These days, the rule makers are attracting attention from Congressional officials, industry advocates and lobbyists, with dozens of executives from firms like Goldman Sachs, Mastercard, JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse meeting with federal regulators recently to give input on specific rules and try to influence the outcome, according to public online postings by federal regulators on many of the meetings.
''I wake up in the morning thinking about this stuff, and I go to sleep at night thinking about it,'' said Tom Quaadman, a senior Chamber of Commerce executive who is leading a group of 10 staff members seeking to shape the financial rules.
The discussions are in the early stages.
But though all sides talk of finding consensus, conflicts have emerged.
The Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, made up of leading chief executives, are suing the Securities and Exchange Commission, arguing that a rule giving proxy access on corporate boards to small shareholders did not get a proper review and would undermine companies.
When these issues still rested with Congress this year, the chamber spent millions on glitzy advertisements opposing the health care and financial regulation. The chamber does not plan anything so showy as the debate shifts to the regulatory agencies, but is bracing for a long fight filled with low-key meetings and court filings.
''It's a substantial amount of resources we've brought to bear on this,'' Mr. Quaadman said. ''We've always seen this as being a marathon. This is a process that's going to take years, and this is the start of the race.''
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created by Congress as part of the financial overhaul, has been the target of particularly intense lobbying, with industry representatives and consumer advocates trying to shape the agency's structure and mission.
Questions about the agency's allegiances have already arisen, however, after it was disclosed that Elizabeth Warren, the White House aide chosen to start up the agency, had worked as a consultant on a lawsuit involving major banks and credit-card companies and that one of her senior aides had worked previously at a mortgage company with a spotty record.
So far, health care regulators have a head start on their financial counterparts. They not only started the process four months earlier when the health care bill passed Congress, but they also have the advantage of already securing start-up funds for rule-making personnel and office space.
In Bethesda, health care officials are leasing more than 70,000 square feet of space on three floors of an office building for about 230 employees to work on rule-making and other duties. The government agreed to pay $51.41 per usable square foot of space, compared with an average of $27 in Bethesda, because it wanted to get the operation running in July, officials said.
In contrast, financial regulators have been unable to get new financing for hundreds of additional rule makers because Congress has not yet passed a budget, and they are largely making do by reassigning existing staff members. Officials at agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is responsible for drafting more than 60 rules, are warning that there is an urgent need for the money.
Annette L. Nazareth, a former S.E.C. official who now represents financial clients before rule makers as a lawyer for the firm of Davis Polk, said short staffing and ''wildly unrealistic'' deadlines set by Congress threatened the entire process.
''These regulators are overwhelmed, and this stuff is being churned out on issues that are enormously complex,'' Ms. Nazareth said. ''It's very bad for the markets to do it this way, and it's bound to have an impact on how things come out.''

HEADLINE: Tax Deal Is Key to Avoid Recession, Obama Adviser Says

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- One of President Obama's top economic advisers warned on Wednesday that the nation could slip back into recession if Congress did not pass the administration's tax cut deal with Republicans, as the White House sought to press Democrats into backing the plan.
But Democrats in the House and Senate were still seething with anger -- both about the substance of the deal, which includes keeping the Bush-era rates even on the highest incomes, and the way they were iced out of the negotiations. It was unclear that the ominous economic forecast by the adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, would help. Senate Democrats said they were still pressing for changes to the plan, but Republicans and the White House showed no signs of flexibility. 
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who failed on Tuesday to persuade many of his old Senate colleagues to get behind the plan, met with House Democrats for more than an hour on Wednesday. Dozens of lawmakers lined up to voice their displeasure, and to ask if there was any chance of reworking the plan, especially a provision setting a generous tax emption for wealthy estates.
''There is a substantial amount of dissatisfaction with the deal that was cut,'' Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, said after the meeting. ''The Democratic caucus put itself on notice that it would not vote for tax cuts for the wealthy because we can't afford them and because they are not needed, and that's the point one Democrat after another is making.''
The continuing anger in Congress raised the likelihood that the tax deal would be approved largely with Republican votes. Enough Senate Democrats were expected to support the plan to surmount any filibuster. And in the House, given Republican support, it seemed possible for the tax plan to be adopted even with two-thirds or more of Democrats voting against it.
The deal would extend for two years the Bush-era tax cuts at all income levels, not just on income up to $250,000 per couple as President Obama had sought. In exchange, Republicans agreed to the administration's demands for a 13-month continuation of jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed, a one-year reduction in the payroll tax for nearly all workers, and other steps aimed at lifting the economy.
The plan also includes an agreement to reduce the estate tax, which lapsed completely this year but is set to return on Jan. 1 with an exemption of $1 million per person and a maximum rate of 55 percent. The deal will set the exemption, or unified credit, at $5 million per estate, and the maximum rate at 35 percent -- a higher exemption and lower tax than many Democrats want.
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, excoriated Democrats for trying to bring up several other issues, including an immigration bill and a Pentagon policy measure that includes authorization to repeal the military's ''don't ask, don't tell'' ban on open service by gay men and lesbians. Mr. McConnell urged the Democrats to bring the tax plan to the floor.
''Are we here to perform or to legislate?'' Mr. McConnell asked.
The majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, struggled on Wednesday to chart a path on several major items, including the tax proposal. Votes were tentatively scheduled for Thursday morning on the immigration measure, which would create a path to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants brought to the United States as young children, and on the military bill.
As attention focused mainly on the tax issue, House Democrats muscled through a stripped-down spending bill that would finance the federal government through Sept. 30 of next year, freezing the budgets of most agencies but including money for the war in Afghanistan.
The bill cuts nearly $46 billion from the president's requested budget, and includes provisions for a two-year pay freeze for non-military federal employees.
The vote was 212 to 206, with 35 Democrats and all 171 Republicans in opposition.
With the president on the defensive with his own party, the White House marshaled an offensive that included circulating dozens of private-sector economic analyses and endorsements from public officials.
But the big gun was the economic warning from Mr. Summers, the soon-departing director of the White House National Economic Council.
''Failure to pass this bill in the next couple weeks would materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out and we would have a double-dip'' recession, Mr. Summers told reporters at a briefing.
Mr. Obama, in a brief appearance with the president of Poland, rebutted a reporter's question alluding to Congressional Democrats' sense of betrayal.
''It is inaccurate to characterize Democrats writ large as feeling 'betrayed,' '' Mr. Obama said. ''I think Democrats are looking at this bill, and you've already had a whole bunch of them who said this makes sense. And I think the more they look at it, the more of them are going to say this makes sense.''
The fight over the Bush-era rates would resume in the coming two years, Mr. Obama said, adding that he would make the case for ''tax reform, that we've got to simplify the system.''

HEADLINE: David Stark on Washington Chic

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
Tucked away inside the sprawling Foggy Bottom complex in Washington that is the State Department are the Diplomatic Reception Rooms -- 42 rooms, used daily by everyone from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Obama to cabinet officials. This year, to celebrate the rooms' 50th anniversary, the State Department teamed up with Time Inc. and InStyle. Ariel Foxman, the editor of InStyle, brought in David Stark, a New York event producer, to decorate a few of the rooms on the eighth floor of the department -- those most frequently used for receptions and diplomacy, and the only ones open to the public -- for the holidays.
The rooms Mr. Stark decorated have already been the site of a dinner for the Kennedy Center Honors recipients. And on Dec. 14, they will be used for a celebration for the families of State Department employees who are serving unaccompanied tours and are away during the holiday season. One recent evening, Mr. Stark took a break from putting on a few finishing touches, and talked about the installation, which includes several miles of red ribbon, 5,000 ornaments and 400 wrapped ''gifts'' (for decoration only). 
Was this a difficult design challenge?
The rooms are so exceptional, and filled with $100 million worth of American heritage antiques. How often are you around things like that? Part of the design challenge is the rooms are so special and of such a certain period that you want to decorate them in ways that are simpatico and really elevate them.
Since this is the State Department, and events like the Middle East Summit are held here, were there any particular themes you tried to avoid, so as not to anger a world leader?
I don't believe there are any holiday decor items that would do that. I know from working all over the world that certain flowers are funerary flowers -- that certain flowers are not to be used for this reason or that -- but not in this particular case. The holidays are a good time for all.
We're still in a difficult economic time. How did you strike a balance between classy and over-the-top opulent?
A big factor in my thinking is always the materials that we use. So there are some things that are fun. I think there's four to five miles of ribbon that are used, but it doesn't look like it because the design is very pure and thought through. You don't look at it and say, ''That's 10,000 orchids.'' You look at it and say, ''Oh, that's ribbon.'' And it's beautiful and cool and feels right in this space, but it's not a material that's particularly expensive or opulent.
There's also a Christmas tree made entirely out of laser-cut mirror.
I'm excited about the tree because it's a great trick. We've never made anything like that before, but the idea of making the tree form out of mirror -- and it's a modern shape in a traditional form -- allows the room to be the star. So what we're seeing in it is the reflection of our surroundings, and it's there and it's not there and it's there all at the same time. And it almost looks as if the garland and ornaments float in midair.
What's your favorite part of the installation?
I like many things: I love the ribbon trees, I like this whole fireplace vignette, I like it all.
Tell me about the ribbon Christmas trees.
The really cool thing about this is that it's one continuous piece of ribbon, and it keeps going until one is finished. It looks really simple. I always try to think of it as a Matisse painting. You know how a Matisse painting looks like it came together in three minutes, but it actually took five years? So I like everything to look like it wasn't labored over, that it just kind of magically came together.
I know that you did a lot of research and spent time looking at the rooms before you started designing. Was there a particular sort of scene or event you envisioned taking place there?
I have to admit, one of the first times we came, there was a swearing-in ceremony or something. So my first impression of these rooms was, like, set up auditorium-style. I didn't really think of it as a party space, I thought of it as a swearing-in room.
What do you think of the adage that Washington is not very glamorous, that it's Hollywood for ugly people?
It's funny, because people love to slam Washington. And because we do so many events here, I have to say that some of the most chic people that I know live here, and I also have the best time at their parties. In Washington, people dance. And they love to go out and have a good time. So I actually think that my goal is to bring this chic-ness to the level that it should and could be.

HEADLINE: Cables Reveal Early Tensions Between U.S. and China on Nobel Winner

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES; Carlos H. Conde contributed reporting from Manila, and Seth Mydans from Bangkok. Li Bibo contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- It was just before Christmas 2009, and Ding Xiaowen was not happy.
The United States ambassador had just written China's foreign minister expressing concern for Liu Xiaobo, the Beijing intellectual imprisoned a year earlier for drafting a pro-democracy manifesto. Now Mr. Ding, a deputy in the ministry's American section, was reading the riot act to an American attache.
Mr. Ding said he would try to avoid ''becoming emotional,'' according to a readout on the meeting that was among thousands of leaked State Department cables released this month. Then he said that a ''strongly dissatisfied'' China firmly opposed the views of the American ambassador, Jon Huntsman, and that Washington must ''cease using human rights as an excuse to 'meddle' in China's internal affairs.''
On Friday, exactly one year after Mr. Huntsman wrote his protest, Mr. Liu, now serving an 11-year prison sentence for subversion, will receive the Nobel Peace Prize in a ceremony that he is unable to attend. And if anything is clear, it is that China no longer resists becoming emotional. 
In the two months since the Nobel committee honored Mr. Liu, China has waged an extraordinary and unprecedented campaign, domestically and internationally, to discredit the award and to dissuade other governments from endorsing it.
It sent diplomats to capitals worldwide, sometimes to two and three offices, to warn that attendance at the awards ceremony in Oslo would be a black mark on relations with China. It staged a briefing for its neighbors, the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to make clear its unhappiness with the award. It has punished Norway, the site of the ceremony, by suspending trade negotiations.
On the Chinese island of Hainan last month, State Councilor Dai Bingguo, China's most powerful foreign policy figure, bluntly told Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that his government regarded the Nobel award as an American conspiracy to embarrass Beijing.
Perhaps most strikingly, China's media and spokespeople have trained a stream of vitriol on the award and its sponsors. The prize is ''an anti-China farce'' and its sponsors are ''clowns,'' a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, said this week at a briefing. Honoring Mr. Liu is ''a crazy act,'' ''a political tool'' and ''a trick that a few radical people use to entertain themselves,'' the Communist Party tabloid Global Times reported Wednesday.
On Oct. 15, after the award was announced, the state-run news service Xinhua called the Nobel decision ''a desecration of the rule of law'' and Mr. Liu an opportunist who had ''tried his best to maintain the Western hegemony of his Western masters and make China a vassal of the West.''
And on Tuesday, a somewhat murky Beijing group announced a counter-Nobel, the Confucius Peace Prize, apparently in response to a Global Times commentary last month that called for an Eastern alternative to prizes based on values it said were Western.
At least 19 governments, most of them staunch China allies like Myanmar, North Korea and Russia, have decided to boycott the Nobel ceremony on Friday. But the list also includes the Philippines, whose president, Benigno S. Aquino III, has been an advocate of human rights in places like Myanmar, where China holds great influence.
Philippine press reports quoted diplomats on Wednesday as saying that Manila opted out of the ceremony because it did not want to annoy China, already angered over a bungled hostage rescue in August that left eight Hong Kong residents dead.
But a senior adviser to Mr. Aquino, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the matter, said that Foreign Secretary Alberto G. Romulo ''did it without telling us.'' The adviser called the move ''a clumsy attempt to balance the administration's more distant stance on China.''
''This administration will be a voice for human rights in this part of the world,'' the official said, ''and now, this.''
Why China's leaders have made Mr. Liu's award a foreign policy red line is far from clear. Political analysts and scholars variously suggested that Mr. Liu's manifesto, Charter 08, was too radical and represented a threat, that China's newfound global prominence had given it an oversize impression of its influence and that party leaders were toeing a hard nationalist position as jockeying began for a new leadership in 2012.
Dozens of leaked State Department cables made it apparent that American diplomats closely followed the travails of Mr. Liu and other activists and regularly pressed Chinese officials to honor international norms for basic freedoms, even as Washington muted its public position on Chinese behavior.
Embassy officials also met frequently with Mr. Liu's wife, Liu Xia, and friends to monitor his case and the increase in repression of political dissidents.
As early as two weeks after Mr. Liu was first detained, President George W. Bush's ambassador, Clark T. Randt Jr., ''urged the Chinese government to release him and stop harassing peaceful dissidents,'' a Dec. 29, 2008, cable stated.
The next June, as the Chinese government announced Mr. Liu's formal arrest on subversion charges, embassy officials expressed ''grave concern'' and again called for his release. On Dec. 9, 2009, shortly before Mr. Liu was convicted, Mr. Huntsman met with five Chinese human rights lawyers; he sent a letter to the foreign minister the next day calling on the government ''to respect those rights it had itself guaranteed in the PRC constitution and to protect internationally recognized freedoms for all Chinese citizens.''
That letter led to Mr. Ding's dressing-down of the attache 11 days later. According to the cable, Mr. Ding said then that Mr. Huntsman's letter contained ''inappropriate comments'' on Mr. Liu's case and that ''certain 'so-called' human rights lawyers and dissidents had sought to advance their 'selfish interests' '' by attacking the Beijing government.
''In a lengthy and disjointed digression,'' the cable added, Mr. Ding said that regardless of rights to speak and assemble freely, the most fundamental human rights were to food and shelter. And ''in this area it was 'a basic fact' that the PRC had made huge progress.''
The American attache's response, the cable stated, was that ''U.S. concerns over abuses of internationally recognized human rights norms remained.''

HEADLINE: On Economy, Bloomberg Says Washington Is Failing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloombergunleashed a withering critique on Wednesday of how Congress and the White House have managed the economic recovery, saying Democrats and Republicans had abdicated responsibility in favor of partisan bickering, vilified success in corporate America and left the country lagging behind the rest of the world.
In a stinging and blunt address that at times sounded like a campaign speech, Mr. Bloomberg described a point-by-point plan for reigniting entrepreneurship and growth, calling for tax cuts for businesses, an overhaul of regulations and investments in job training. 
He proposed few new concrete ideas, instead relying on familiar successes in New York City, which he argued could be applied on a national scale. But at a time when leaders of both parties are clashing over a stubbornly high unemployment inching toward 10 percent, it was Mr. Bloomberg's harsh assessment of Washington politics and his call for centrist problem-solving that was most striking.
''Last month, voters turned against Democrats in Washington for the same reason they turned against Republicans in 2006,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''Democrats now, and Republicans then, spent more time and energy conducting partisan warfare than forging centrist solutions to our toughest economic problems.''
''Put simply,'' he added, ''when it comes to creating jobs, government hasn't gotten the job done.''
The sweeping scope of the speech and its deliberate timing, just weeks after Mr. Bloomberg endorsed a flurry of moderate candidates in the midterm elections, instantly intensified speculation about his political ambitions. Next week, he is scheduled to speak at the formal unveiling of a national group called No Labels, which will seek to combat partisan gridlock with chapters in every Congressional district.
Mr. Bloomberg, 68, the nation's most prominent and wealthiest independent politician, has repeatedly ruled out running for president in 2012, claiming his chances of victory are too slim. His speech, however, suggested that he is determined to harness the news media spotlight and influence the political discourse in the run-up to that election.
In the hours after he spoke, the mayor's aides amplified his message in a series of television appearances: Deputy Mayor Robert K. Steel spoke on CNBC, and Deputy Mayor Howard Wolfson showed up on MSNBC. On Sunday, Mr. Bloomberg will be on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC.
Mr. Bloomberg delivered his remarks on Wednesday to a group of business leaders at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. There, he trumpeted signs of an economic rebound in New York, where, in contrast with the nation at large, unemployment is falling, and economic activity is accelerating.
In New York, he said, business is flourishing because people have confidence in the city's leadership -- the kind of faith, he seemed to suggest, that most Americans have lost in the federal government. Right now, he said, ''government solutions ooze ambiguity.''
He emphasized a set of relatively inexpensive solutions for the nation's economic problems, dismissing what he described as the flawed, overly simplified dogmas of the left and the right.
''Despite what ideologues on the left believe,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, ''government cannot tax and spend its way back to prosperity, especially when that spending is driven by pork barrel politics.
''Despite what ideologues on the right believe, government should not stand aside and wait for the business cycle to run its natural course. That would be intolerable.''
Congress and the Obama administration, Mr. Bloomberg said, need to pump money into job placement services like those the Bloomberg administration has opened across New York City, through which tens of thousands of residents have found work; promote foreign trade with emerging economies that, like India, want to invest in the American economy; and simplify a thicket of federal regulations, especially those surrounding derivatives, which he said have created uncertainty in the market and have made businesses reluctant to invest.
As he has in the past, the mayor defended corporations, and, implicitly, Wall Street, whose success, he said, has become a liability in the wake of the economic crisis of 2008, when the federal government offered emergency loans to big banks and the automobile industry.
''It's time to take a step back,'' he said, ''and ask ourselves, 'When did success become a bad word in America?' ''
But Mr. Bloomberg reserved his sharpest words for elected officials in Washington, who he said have indulged in partisanship rather than common sense when it comes to the economy.
''Both parties follow the mood of the moment -- instead of leading from the front,'' he said. ''They incite anger instead of addressing it -- for their own partisan interests. They tell the world about every real or imagined problem in America, and not what is right with America.
''Especially in these tough times, we need our leaders to inspire the whole country, not criticize half of it.''

HEADLINE: On Christmas Shopping Lists, No Credit Slips

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Christmas will no longer be on credit for many shoppers, despite tempting offers from retailers and credit card companies trying to coax the plastic out of consumers' wallets.
The lowest percentage of shoppers in the 27-year-history of a national survey said they used credit cards over the Thanksgiving weekend, while the use of general credit cards like Visa and MasterCard fell 11 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to the credit bureau TransUnion.
''Cash is the route I'm taking this year, from past experiences with credit cards and being in debt and trying to pay it off for so many years,'' said Liz Gonzalez, a community-college employee in Signal Hill, Calif. Her debt problems started two Christmases ago, when she charged the gifts that turned into the bills that sent her life into disarray. Ms. Gonzalez, 40, still owes $2,200 from that Christmas, and said her recent divorce had been caused in part by the stress of debt.
So this year, she is buying gifts only for her two children, and will use cash to stay on a $500 budget. 
''I was spending so much with them,'' she said of the credit cards. ''I lost control.''
Britt Beemer, chief executive of America's Research Group, a survey firm, said that was a common sentiment. ''The consumer really feels a lot of pressure from previous debts, and they just aren't going to dig themselves into that kind of hole,'' he said.
After the Thanksgiving shopping weekend, the group found that just about 17 percent were paying with credit -- just over half of last year's level and the lowest rate in the 27 years it has conducted a survey.
Some people are shunning credit cards for budgeting reasons, while others do not have a choice. More than 15 million Americans lost their cards because of strict credit-card regulations that were passed last year, or when issuers cut back on credit during the recession, said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a credit card industry newsletter.
If consumers like Ms. Gonzalez are trying to be careful this holiday, retailers, banks and credit card companies are hoping for a little less caution. The amount that consumers said they spent over Black Friday weekend, a crucial shopping period, was up more than 6 percent this year from last year, according to the National Retail Federation.
When people overspend, credit card issuers reap profit from consumers who pay only part of their bills. Shoppers using retailers' branded cards tend to spend more and visit stores more, said Robert S. Drbul, an analyst at Barclays Capital. So all are offering big incentives to get people to use plastic.
The Chase Freedom and Discover More cards, for instance, are offering$100 bonuses when new credit card customers spend a certain amount within the first three months, along with 5 percent cash back on holiday purchases at department stores and other categories.
Citibank is giving Dividend cardholders 5 percent back on spending at department, clothing and electronics stores through Dec. 31. Target is giving its cardholders a 5 percent discount on purchases, Neiman Marcus is advertising extra rewards points on most purchases on certain days this month, and Sears has been running a variety of no-payment, no-interest offers on its credit cards throughout the holidays.
''The credit card companies are falling all over themselves trying to make those rewards even better,'' Mr. Robertson said. But, with customers moving to cash or debit, the companies are ''simply less profitable,'' he said.
James Hansen has been avoiding credit cards for months. He began accumulating debt when he went on short-term disability leave from his job as a maintenance engineer about three years ago, just after getting married and having a second child.
''Half of my payments were interest,'' said Mr. Hansen, 34, who lives in Kihei, Hawaii. ''I'm still working on paying off the bills.''
This holiday season, he said, ''I'll buy a few gifts with cash if I can. It's not going to be easy.''
Even for people with steady income through the recession, like Ms. Gonzalez, credit is no longer attractive.
In 2008, with a new baby and a teenage son, plus a big extended family, she would go grocery shopping using her Sam's Club and Costco cards, and add Christmas gifts to her cart. ''It was so convenient,'' she said.
She knew she was charging a lot -- she also had Macy's and Kohl's cards, and a State Farm Visa that was carrying a balance from an earlier Costco card -- but she thought cash-back rewards programs would help.
''In the back of my mind, I was thinking, 'Well, I'll get extra cash at the end of the year,' '' she said. But on the Costco card, for instance, she got about $80 back -- a fraction of the $4,000 she had charged, or the $3,000 on her Sam's card. Mortgage and car payments piled on the debt.
''With the interest rates, it just seemed like I never paid it off,'' she said.
She had to face up to the debt when she and her husband began looking for a bigger house to accommodate their growing family. Ms. Gonzalez said she had been paying the bills, and the couple had not discussed their finances in detail until they began house-hunting around Christmas 2008.
''There was too much debt,'' she said. That stress, she said, helped lead to divorce.
''One of the main causes of the divorce -- I was married for 17 years -- other than miscommunication and growing apart, the money was a big one,'' she said.
Ms. Gonzalez had to account for how much she owed when she filed for divorce in 2009. She had hit the limit on the Costco and Sam's cards, and owed smaller amounts on the department store cards. Based on a segment she had seen on ''Oprah,'' she made a list of what she could pay, and began paying it off little by little.
She has now paid off the State Farm, Sam's and department store cards. She still owes $2,200 on the Costco card, where her interest rate went up after a few late payments. Ms. Gonzalez hopes to pay that off, finally, by the spring, so she can qualify for a home loan. (She moved in with her mother after the divorce).
To avoid the temptation to charge gifts again, she opened a savings account where she has put spare cash throughout the year -- $5 when she skips buying lunch, $10 when she is reimbursed for work expenses. The $500 will go to a camera for her son and clothes for her daughter.''I'm very strict right now,'' she said. ''I didn't have a choice.''

HEADLINE: Making Disability Work

BYLINE: By PETER ORSZAG. 
Peter Orszag, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget from 2009 to July 2010, is a distinguished visiting fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

 BODY:
I will begin a new job for Citigroup in January, so this is my last article as a contributing columnist for The Times. I hope to see you again from time to time on the Op-Ed page.
One of the gravest dangers posed by the weak economy is that the unemployed will become discouraged and give up looking for work, perhaps permanently as their skills atrophy. This would be harmful not only to the workers and their families, but also to the economy as a whole, as those people would no longer contribute to economic growth. The longer the labor market remains sluggish, the more pronounced this risk becomes.
Unfortunately, at this point more than six million people have been unemployed for six months or longer. More than one million have already given up looking for work because they believe no job is available. And a drastic rise in applications for disability insurance suggests we may be headed for more long-lasting trouble. The number of disability applications has reached more than 750,000 a quarter, according to the Social Security Administration, an increase of more than 50 percent from four years ago. 
The disability insurance program provides crucial support for people who can no longer work because of a disability. But once someone begins receiving benefits, the likelihood that he will re-enter the work force is almost nonexistent; recipients become permanently dependent on the program.
The result is not only lost economic productivity, but also a fiscal burden for the federal government: disability benefits now cost more than $120 billion a year, and Medicare benefits for those on disability add $70 billion.
The spike in disability insurance applications (and awards) does not reflect a less healthy population. The fraction of working-age adults who report a disability, about one in 10, has remained roughly constant for the past 20 years. (Indeed, it would be surprising if the number of workers with disabilities had risen by 50 percent over the past four years.) Rather, the weak labor market has driven more people to apply for disability benefits that they qualify for but wouldn't need if they could find work.
When Congress created the disability insurance program in 1956, it required that recipients be unable to ''engage in substantial gainful activity in the U.S. economy.'' In other words, they had to be unable to work. That was sensible at the time, when more jobs involved physical labor and technologies to assist people with disabilities were not widely available.
Today, however, many people with disabilities are able to engage in some form of work -- even if they can't admit that and still keep their insurance benefits. Cutting off access to the workplace in this way is both unfortunate and unnecessary -- and reinforces the threat that the current downturn could cause a long-term reduction in the share of people who work.
So what should be done?
First, macroeconomic policy. We need more stimulus immediately, and more deficit reduction enacted now to take effect in two or three years. The plan just proposed by the White House in a compromise with Congressional Republicans is encouraging in that it includes a new payroll tax holiday, a helpful stimulus. It does not reduce future deficits, but at least it avoids making the Bush tax cuts permanent, reserving the flexibility to address medium-term deficits down the road.
Even if this plan goes ahead, however, the unemployment rate is likely to remain high for some time. For it to fall by even one percentage point (from 9.5 percent to 8.5 percent) the economy needs to grow by about 4.5 percent a year.
Second, unemployment insurance should be extended, as President Obama's compromise plan also would do. Unemployment benefits are a form of stimulus: they spur spending and thereby help keep the economy afloat. Just as important, unemployment benefits keep many people from falling back on disability insurance -- and unlike disability insurance, which effectively prohibits beneficiaries from seeking work, unemployment insurance requires recipients to keep looking for a job and thus remain connected to the work force.
Finally, the disability insurance program itself must be reformed. Program administrators understand the need to encourage beneficiaries to return to work, and they have experimented with various incentives. Such initiatives have generally been ineffective, though, because they reach beneficiaries too late, after they have already become dependent on the program and lost their attachment to the work force.
A better approach has been suggested by David Autor of M.I.T. and Mark Duggan of the University of Maryland. In a paper released last week from the Center for American Progress and the Hamilton Project, these economists argue that employers should be required to offer their workers private disability insurance. Such coverage would provide people who have a work-limiting disability with vocational assistance, workplace accommodation and limited wage replacement. All of these benefits would kick in within 90 days of the onset of disability, to avoid the problems with delayed assistance that have plagued efforts to reform public disability insurance. Private employers would have an incentive to prevent their workers from having to file disability applications, because their insurance premiums would rise in response to higher disability rates.
Disabled workers could remain on this privately financed insurance for two years, and then be eligible for the existing public program. The goal would be to minimize long-term dependency, and re-orient the federal disability insurance program toward assisting those who are truly unable to work.
One concern is that this approach would burden firms with additional human resource costs when we need to encourage hiring. But the costs are projected to be modest -- roughly $250 per worker per year. And if they help to reduce the future payroll tax increases that would be needed to finance rapid growth in disability benefits, the pressure on overall labor costs would be even smaller.
Another concern is that private insurance firms would need to be given substantially expanded responsibility for evaluating workers' disabilities. Mr. Autor and Mr. Duggan propose to mitigate this potential problem by suggesting that workers be allowed to appeal any such evaluations to state government agencies.
The Netherlands has adopted a program like this, and the results so far are promising. In 1994, the Dutch government required all firms to finance the first six weeks of disability benefits. That period was later extended to one year and then to two years. In 2002, the program was broadened to require back-to-work plans, developed cooperatively by the disabled worker, his employer and a consulting doctor. The number of disability recipients in the Netherlands has since declined significantly.
None of these policy changes would be easy. But failing to act would result in millions of Americans needlessly dropping out of the work force. In our precarious economy, neither progressives nor conservatives should be willing to watch passively as the disability insurance rolls grow, and beneficiaries are locked out of the labor market.

HEADLINE: OBAMA WEIGHING BROAD OVERHAUL FOR INCOME TAX

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama is considering whether to push early next year for an overhaul of the income tax code to lower rates and raise revenues in what would be his first major effort to begin addressing the long-term growth of the national debt.
While administration officials cautioned on Thursday that no decisions have been made and that any debate in Congress could take years, Mr. Obama has directed his economic team and Treasury Department analysts to review options for closing loopholes and simplifying income taxes for corporations and individuals, though the study of the corporate tax system is farther along, officials said.
The objective is to rid the code of its complex buildup of deductions, credits and exemptions, thereby broadening the base of taxes collected and allowing for lower rates -- much like a bipartisan majority on Mr. Obama's debt-reduction commission recommended last week in its final blueprint for reducing the debt through 2020.
Doing so would offer not only an opportunity to begin confronting the growth in the national debt but also a way to address warnings by American business that corporate tax rates and the costs of complying with the tax code are cutting into their global competitiveness. 
Mr. Obama signaled his inclination in off-the-cuff remarks on Wednesday as he was defending the tax cuts deal negotiated with Congressional Republicans this week. ''We've got to have tax reform,'' he said.
Economic and political advisers say the process is in its early stages, and Mr. Obama ultimately could decide against such action, given the pitfalls, both political and substantive. In the past, any effort to alter the tax code has provoked powerful opposition among interest groups, and the picking of winners and losers.
Yet proponents within the administration and among some outside advisers say that Mr. Obama, by putting tax reform atop the national agenda, could seize an opportunity to take the offensive in dealing with the newly empowered Republicans in Congress, repair his strained relations with business and embrace a potentially powerful theme heading into his re-election campaign.
Democrats have long struggled to define battles over taxes on their terms. The revolt by many members of the president's party in Congress over his deal with Republicans, which would extend the Bush-era tax cuts for the rest of his term and create his own tax cuts for lower-income people and for businesses, has underscored anew the deep ideological divisions in Washington on the subject. Should that deal be enacted, it could add to pressure for simplifying the tax system because its mix of breaks for taxpayers of all incomes would further complicate the tax code, at least for the next year or two.
Administration officials and lawmakers in both parties also took note last week of the bipartisan show of support within the fiscal commission for changes of the type being considered by Mr. Obama. That suggested a potential break in the long-solid Republican wall of opposition to anything that smacked of a tax increase.
Rather than increase individual and corporate tax rates to raise more revenues, a majority of the panel proposed eliminating or reducing many of the popular tax breaks for businesses and individuals that cost $1 trillion annually and using the additional revenues to lower rates and reduce deficits. The majority included five Republicans, among them two of the Senate's most conservative members, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Michael D. Crapo of Idaho.
According to commission officials, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, expressed interest in the panel's approach. With tax breaks ended or restricted in return for lower rates, businesses and individual taxpayers would know that for each credit or deduction they wanted put back into the code, their marginal tax rates would go up by an amount sufficient to make up the revenues that would be lost.
Some Democrats argue that the White House should take the lead, before Republicans do. Even as administration officials deliberate over their course, a growing number of conservative economists and strategists are urging Congressional Republicans to quit fighting the decade-old fight over the Bush tax rates and take up the reform mantle.
''Declare Bush tax cuts, like the Bush administration itself, over,'' Kevin A. Hassett, the director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning research organization, wrote recently in a Bloomberg News column.
''The fact is,'' he added, ''if we extend the Bush tax cuts, it locks in the status quo. Earth to Washington: The status quo stinks. With the economy still limping forward, much more significant fiscal-policy medicine is in order.''
Mr. Obama, in his brief remarks on Wednesday during a meeting with the president of Poland, suggested that Republicans would still be defending the Bush tax rates for the next two years while he is looking forward to a new, better code.
''We're going to have a big debate about taxes and we're going to have a big debate about the budget and we're going to have a big debate about deficits,'' he said. ''And Republicans are going to have to explain to the American people over the next two years how making those tax cuts for the high end permanent squares with their stated desire to start reducing deficits and debt.''
''I'll have the opportunity,'' he added, ''to make the case that we've got to have tax reform, that we've got to simplify the system, that we do have to cut spending where it makes sense. But we're also going to have to make sure that we've got a tax code that is fair and that looks after the interest of middle-class Americans and continues to grow the economy.''
Next year will be the 25th anniversary of the previous overhaul of the income tax code that lowered rates and wiped away many tax breaks in return. As administration officials point out -- by way of lowering expectations for action soon -- the process leading to the 1986 act was begun nearly three years earlier, when President Ronald Reagan called for a fairer, simpler code in his 1984 State of the Union address. And the legislation several times seemed dead.
The earlier effort also involved a president of one party facing a Congress partly controlled by the opposition party.
While the overhaul of a quarter-century ago raised taxes for many corporations, the legislation was designed to be ''deficit neutral'' -- it neither increased nor reduced the government's tax collection over all. But people in both parties agree that the next tax-overhaul effort would almost certainly have to raise revenues to address the nation's growing fiscal problems.
''I think it is important to understand that that is not a process that will happen overnight,'' Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said Thursday. ''That will take -- as it did I think in the last major tax code revision in the mid '80s -- that will take some time.'' But, he added, Mr. Obama and his economic team ''certainly believe that it's good to start that long process.''

HEADLINE: Accounting For Public Pensions

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
A generation ago, when Ronald Reagan was president, the accounting rule makers forced American companies to come clean on the cost of the pension plans they were promising to employees. That decision, perhaps more than any other, heralded the eventual demise of defined-benefit pensions for employees of American companies.
Now something very similar may be in store for public sector employees, thanks in part to the Republican victories in last month's Congressional elections.
Forcing companies to account in a reasonable manner for their pensions was a contentious issue at one time. Companies feared it would slash reported profits, and they preferred a system where the only expense they had to count was the money the company actually put into the pension plan. Roger Smith, then the chairman of General Motors, came to a hearing of the Financial Accounting Standards Board to denounce the idea. G.M. argued that such accounting would violate its agreement with the United Automobile Workers union, an argument that seemed to perplex the accountants. 
The rule adopted was far from perfect, but it forced companies to estimate the cost of pension benefits being accrued each year. Companies were allowed to ''smooth'' the numbers by phasing in market changes in the values of pension fund assets, so there was reason to complain that the figures could be misleading. But the principle was established.
Today, not nearly as many companies offer defined-benefit plans to new employees. It is far more common to see a company that has stopped allowing workers to accumulate new benefits, even though companies are still liable for benefits earned before plans were changed or closed. The accountants forced companies to confront the risks they were taking -- in effect guaranteeing that pension fund investments would grow -- and the companies decided the risks were too great.
As a result, a part of the safety net that previous generations took for granted became far less secure. Workers now tend to have defined-contribution plans, like 401(k)'s, to which they and their employers contribute. The worker chooses the investments, and bears the consequences when they go up or down in value.
That fact almost certainly contributed to the severity of the 2007-9 recession and the slowness of the recovery that has followed. Far more Americans than ever before had a direct stake in the stock market, and the sharp fall in stocks meant that their retirement plans had to change. The number of people over 60 with jobs is up 10 percent over the last three years while the number of jobs held by people under 60 has fallen by 7 percent.
The stock market has regained most of the lost ground since then, but many 401(k) plans have not benefited. Many people reduced their stock market investments at precisely the wrong time. Mutual funds that invest primarily in American stocks have suffered net withdrawals of $90 billion since the stock market hit bottom.
As companies moved away from defined-benefit plans, most cities and states did not follow. One reason for that may have been that the Government Accounting Standards Board -- the public sector equivalent of FASB -- has done much less to force good disclosures, or comparable ones.
Having limited information available can obscure problems, but when concerns arise, a lack of good data can have the opposite effect; people assume the worst.
Estimates of unfunded pension liabilities can be breathtaking. Two economists, Robert Novy-Marx of the University of Rochester and Joshua Rauh of Northwestern, put the figures at $3 trillion for state governments and almost $600 billion for municipalities. Those figures are far greater than official government figures, and are highly dependent on interest rate levels, which can and do fluctuate. They may be too high, but there is no way to be sure of that.
Some people say the 1974 passage of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as Erisa, led to the demise of private pension plans because companies for the first time really had to honor pension promises. But the trend did not pick up steam until the accountants forced disclosure of real numbers. Most state constitutions have long barred cutting public pension benefits that have been earned, but that fact alone did not force change.
This week, three Republican members of Congress, led by Representative Devin Nunes of California, a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, proposed legislation to force states and cities to report pension fund liabilities on the same basis, and to force them to disclose market values of assets. The bill would not even allow smoothing, so the state of pension funding will seem volatile as markets rise and fall. Such volatility could be reduced by putting more pension money into bonds than stocks, but doing so would force governments to admit they were likely to earn less on investments, and thus need to put even more money into pension plans.
The congressmen would not like to have it said they are forcing anything. The bill gives local governments a choice: they can report the way the members want them to report, or they can give up the ability to issue tax-exempt bonds. That is, of course, no choice at all.
Introducing a bill is not the same as passing one, but this may be an idea whose time has come. There is rising concern over the state of local government finances, and governments may be forced to make better disclosures if they simply want to issue new bonds.
Disclosures are likely to lead to growing pressure to rein in pension costs, even though that will be resisted by public employee unions, which often have considerable political clout.
Even assuming legislatures want to act, doing so is not easy, in part because of state constitutional provisions. Governments could follow corporate precedents by treating new employees differently and by stopping existing employees from accumulating new benefits. But that may not be enough to stem the flood of red ink, particularly in cities and states where pension fund contributions have been deferred to avoid cuts in other spending.
Some abuses can be stopped, such as the practice of allowing retiring employees to work hundreds of hours of overtime in their final year, and then counting that pay in determining the pension payment, which is often based on a percentage of annual pay. It is not clear how many abuses there are, but the publicity given to some of those that do exist has damaged the image of, and public sympathy for, public employees. There is also a widespread suspicion that mayors and governors have agreed to excessive pension benefits, often as a substitute for pay increases, simply because the bill would be paid by some future administration.
Companies have the option of going bankrupt and getting the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a federal agency, to take over their obligations. The P.B.G.C. can then reduce payments on larger pensions. But it is not clear what will happen when cities go bankrupt, in part because there are not that many precedents, and states apparently cannot file for bankruptcy at all. Of course, the fact a state cannot file in bankruptcy court does not mean it cannot go broke.
There has been talk of shared sacrifice, in which employees accept lower benefits, taxpayers pay more and bondholders also take hits. You can argue that is what happened in New York City a quarter of a century ago, when some bondholders were forced to extend maturities. But widespread expectations that such a thing was possible could drive up borrowing costs for all localities, making their fiscal problems that much worse.
In the end, I suspect ways will be found to abrogate some pension promises. But even if that does not happen, the trend away from defined-benefit pensions is likely to affect most younger public employees, as it already has their counterparts in the private sector. The retirement safety net will thus become a little more frayed.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Delays Tougher Rules On Emissions

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
The Obama administration is retreating on long-delayed environmental regulations -- new rules governing smog and toxic emissions from industrial boilers -- as it adjusts to a changed political dynamic in Washington with a more muscular Republican opposition.
The move to delay the rules, announced this week by the Environmental Protection Agency, will leave in place policies set by President George W. Bush. President Obama ran for office promising tougher standards, and the new rules were set to take effect over the next several weeks. 
Now, the agency says, it needs until July 2011 to further analyze scientific and health studies of the smog rules and until April 2012 on the boiler regulation. Mr. Obama, having just cut a painful deal with Republicans intended to stimulate the economy, can ill afford to be seen as simultaneously throttling the fragile recovery by imposing a sheaf of expensive new environmental regulations that critics say will cost jobs.
The delays represent a marked departure from the first two years of the Obama presidency, when the E.P.A. moved quickly to reverse one Bush environmental policy after another. Administration officials now face the question of whether in their zeal to undo the Bush agenda they reached too far and provoked an unmanageable political backlash.
Environmental advocates are furious. They fear a similar delay on the approaching start of one of the most far-reaching regulatory programs in American environmental history, the effort to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
But in a striking turnabout, the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute -- which have been anything but friendly to Mr. Obama -- are praising his administration.
''Clearly, the agency has heard the calls from manufacturers,'' said Keith McCoy, vice president for energy and natural resources at the manufacturers' group. ''We hope this week's announcements signal that the E.P.A. is slowing down on overly burdensome and unnecessary rules that will crush economic growth and job creation.''
White House officials said that no plan was under way to retreat from the president's aggressive environmental agenda. And some Democratic policy analysts said the environmental agency was simply exercising its usual caution, albeit in a new political climate.
''The E.P.A. always operates under the caricature of environmental zealots, and the reality is that economic concerns and the ability for business to continue operating is always a significant consideration,'' said Joshua Freed, director of the clean energy program at Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. ''The administration's number one goal over the next two years is going to be expanding economic growth. The environmental regulatory process has always played out in that context, and that's not going to change.''
The delays come as the president is reaching out to a newly empowered Republican Party on tax policy, a move that is angering his own Democratic base. He must now decide whether to make similar efforts on environmental issues.
''Obama has already signaled that in his quest for re-election he's more than willing to turn against his base in order to make a compromise with his adversaries,'' Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch, an advocacy group, said in an e-mail, responding to the rules delay.
Mr. O'Donnell said the administration was clearly ''running scared'' from the incoming Congress and said he suspected that it was willing to moderate its stand on a variety of environmental regulations, including pending greenhouse gas rules aimed at reducing the pollutants that contribute to global warming.
The E.P.A. has said that it will begin regulating carbon emissions from power plants and other major stationary sources on Jan. 2, as a prelude to broader regulation of carbon dioxide in future years. Delaying that program would undercut much of what officials are trying to do in international negotiations like the United Nations climate talks now under way in Cancun, Mexico.
''Look, in January there will be appropriations battles and a whole lot of other tough fights,'' said Jeffrey Holmstead, head of the E.P.A.'s air quality office in the recent Bush administration and now a lobbyist for industry. ''The administration is going to be feeling a lot of pressure, and they would be better off to do some sort of a deal acceptable to the Republicans to delay this rather than having to threaten a veto.''
The delayed smog rule would lower the allowable concentration of airborne ozone to 60 to 70 parts per billion from the current level of 75 parts per billion, putting several hundred cities in violation of air pollution standards. The agency says that the new rule would save thousands of lives per year but cost businesses and municipalities as much as $90 billion annually.
The boiler rule would affect 200,000 industrial boilers, heaters and solid waste incinerators and is intended to cut emissions of mercury and other dangerous pollutants in half.
Lisa P. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, described the rules delay as a technical and tactical decision. She said she was delaying them for a matter of months merely to get ''further interpretation'' of scientific and health studies of their effects. An agency official said the delays were not a response to Congressional threats to curb the agency's power or cut its budget.
Still, the threats are looming. Representative Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who is in line to become the new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has made limiting E.P.A. authority one of his main objectives and has promised a steady round of hearings questioning the basis of agency actions.
Mr. Upton suggested recently that Ms. Jackson should be given her own parking place on Capitol Hill because she would be testifying so frequently in the coming year.
In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Upton called for the environmental agency to ''stand down altogether'' from the rules, which he said would ''send a devastating economic shockwave coast to coast.''
Mr. Upton and Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the highest-ranking Republican on the Senate panel that oversees the E.P.A., followed up Thursday evening with a letter to Ms. Jackson in which they said they were ''gravely concerned'' about the direction the agency is taking. They vowed to conduct a thorough oversight investigation of the new rules.

HEADLINE: Quebec Fans Take Quest for a Team to Long Island

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
An estimated 1,100 fans from Quebec are piling into chartered buses and heading to Nassau Coliseum for Saturday night's game between the Islanders and the Atlanta Thrashers, intent on sending a message to N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman: We want a team of our own.
''This is not a demonstration,'' said Vincent Cauchon, a radio sports show host and a founder of Nordiques Nation, the fan group that is organizing the trip. ''We just want to show the N.H.L. that Quebec needs a team and is a better market; maybe a third of the markets in the N.H.L. aren't doing so well right now.'' 
The Islanders and the Thrashers are in the midst of well-publicized attendance and financial problems. The Islanders, with the N.H.L.'s worst record, are 28th in attendance; the Thrashers are 29th, despite having a winning record.
''One reason we picked Nassau is because every time we watched an Islanders game on TV, there was no one in there,'' said Cauchon, who noted that the price for the trip, hotel and game ticket was $200 per person.
Still, it is the Thrashers, not the Islanders, who the Quebec fans have their eyes on, according to Cauchon.
''We have a lot of respect for the New York Islanders and what they accomplished in the past -- the N.H.L. needs the Islanders,'' Cauchon said. ''But it would be great, awesome, if the Thrashers moved. Atlanta is a great sports city, but it's not a hockey town. We're not going to New York to tell the N.H.L. they didn't do a good job going to Atlanta. We're going there to tell them in Quebec it would work.''
The Quebec fans, many of whom will be clad in the sweaters of the Nordiques, will take the 550-mile trip in 22 buses. They will cross the border at Champlain, N.Y., the organizers having sent each passenger's passport number ahead to speed the crossing through United States Customs.
They expect to arrive in New York early Saturday and disperse to six hotels in New Jersey and Long Island. They will reassemble and head to the Coliseum at 3 p.m. for the 7 p.m. game. They will sit together in two blocks, behind each net.
The Nordiques moved from Quebec to Denver in 1995 and became the Colorado Avalanche. But the mayor of Quebec, Regis Labeaume, is pushing to build a $400 million arena to lure an N.H.L. team back. The provincial government has pledged 45 percent of construction costs, but the Conservative-controlled federal government has not committed to public financing of the project.
On Oct. 2, Nordiques Nation, which says it has more than 70,000 members, organized what it called a Blue March to mobilize support for the Nordiques' return. It drew 50,000 fans and 16 former Nordiques.
''Quebec City has what most cities don't: extraordinary support from the fans, the excitement, the atmosphere,'' the former Nordiques star Peter Stastny told the crowd.
Despite repeated statements from Bettman and other N.H.L. officials that they do not want franchises to move, fans in Canada assert that some American teams lose so much money it is inevitable that one or two will move north.
The Islanders' owner, Charles Wang, is locked in a longstanding battle with local governments over his plans to overhaul the Coliseum as part of a large real estate development called the Lighthouse Project.
The Thrashers' president, Don Waddell, was candid earlier this week at the N.H.L. board of governors meeting in Palm Beach, Fla., about the need to find new investors for his money-losing team.
''Our owners are looking for partners, from very small to very large,'' Waddell said, adding that the constant talk of the Thrashers relocating ''does get frustrating.''
Despite the problems of the Thrashers and other Sun Belt teams like the Phoenix Coyotes, Florida Panthers and Dallas Stars, the N.H.L. has gone to great lengths to prevent franchise shifts over the last decade.
The league acted to keep the Ottawa Senators and the Buffalo Sabres in place when they went bankrupt early in the decade, and it bought the Coyotes out of bankruptcy and has operated them for a year and a half while pledging to keep them in the Phoenix area.
But in Canada there is still resentment over what is seen as Bettman's failure in the 1990s to prevent the Nordiques and the Winnipeg Jets from relocating to Denver and Phoenix.
The Coyotes' bankruptcy is seen as an example of a failed N.H.L. policy of Sun Belt expansion. Traditionalists argue that Canadian cities, now flush with a Canadian dollar at par with its American counterpart, make more cultural and economic sense as homes for N.H.L. teams.

BERLIN -- Germany is determined to defend the euro as a political project that glues Europe together, its foreign minister said Thursday, dismissing euro bonds or other devices as a way to shore up the common currency.
Europeans -- and not just Germans -- understand that only solid economies are able to support the currency, the foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, said.
The euro, he said, ''is more than just a currency made of paper and metal. It is a currency of peace, a political project that also strengthens us in a time of globalization in comparison with many of our competitors.'' 
That said, Mr. Westerwelle, 48, who leads the pro-business Free Democrats in the governing coalition, said Germany wished ''to keep its sovereignty over its public finances'' -- which is why Berlin opposed the euro bonds.
Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, who is also chairman of the euro zone group, this week criticized Germany for dismissing outright his suggestion for euro bonds to deter speculation against euro zone countries.
But Mr. Westerwelle said euro bonds would provide governments few incentives to save.
''We cannot accept a transfer union in which everybody would collectively be liable for all of the debt in Europe,'' he said. ''That would end any incentive for countries to exert budgetary discipline if it's clear that a handful of countries guarantee everything and are liable.''
Indeed, he implied, this would damage Germany by raising its borrowing costs, which at the moment are the lowest in the euro zone.
Mr. Westerwelle, who has been in office a little over a year, was most recently in the headlines over leaked diplomatic cables in which the United States ambassador, Philip D. Murphy, described him as ''incompetent, vain and critical of the United States.''
On Thursday, the minister, whose office summoned reporters from The International Herald Tribune and four European newspapers at short notice, exuded confidence. He eschewed his trademark rambling answers for short, concise replies to a barrage of questions and addressed the leaked cables briefly at the end of a 50-minute meeting.
''Trust is the handwork of diplomacy,'' he said. ''The leaks crossed the threshold.''
Most questions focused on the euro, whose existence has come under increasing question as Greece, then Ireland, faced fierce market pressure to deal with mounting government debt.
With Chancellor Angela Merkel's government of conservatives and Free Democrats apparently determined to reduce Germany's budget deficit, Mr. Westerwelle made clear that Berlin was in no mood for conciliatory or soft gestures to profligate spenders.
''There have to be incentives for every country to keep the discipline in its own public finances,'' Mr. Westerwelle said. ''That incentive is gone the second that somebody else takes responsibility for your own debt -- just as it is for private individuals.''
''We Germans are not just defending the interests of our own German taxpayers,'' he said. ''Our call for budgetary discipline and structural reforms serves the interests of all taxpayers in all of Europe.''
Other countries, including the United States, say Germany should support a much bigger rescue package beyond the 720 billion euros agreed to last May by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund to protect euro zone countries.
Acknowledging that there are at least two schools of thought about how to stimulate growth, Mr. Westerwelle indirectly criticized American monetary policy. ''There are two philosophies in Europe and regrettably in the whole world as well,'' he said. ''One thinks that it is possible to keep the bubble from bursting by injecting more air through more debt. We say it is only possible to keep one bubble from bursting by taking out air in a controlled way and returning to a consolidated budget.''
Germany's conviction that its policies are the right ones have already been vindicated by events in Greece, Mr. Westerwelle said.
Germany was criticized by other European Union countries for reacting too slowly to the prospect that Greece might actually default, then eventually agreeing to a rescue for Greece in May. Athens -- followed this week by Dublin -- had to introduce radical cuts and savings to bring deficits under control.
Mr. Westerwelle said tires were burned and shop windows were smashed in Athens when George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, pushed through the austerity package. But last month, his Pasok Party made big gains in local government elections.
''The success that Prime Minister Papandreou just had in local elections shows that Europe's peoples have completely understood that one cannot live on too much borrowed money for too long,'' Mr. Westerwelle said. ''Believe me, there is nothing that we propose for Europe that we don't do ourselves in Germany.''
Germany, for example, increased the pension age to 67 years -- ''not really popular,'' noted Mr. Westerwelle -- and introduced spending cuts of 80 billion euros through to 2013, when the next national elections are due.
''People used to think that it would be the next generation that would some day have to deal with the issue of public debts,'' he said. ''And now everybody is surprised that it doesn't take that long, that it hits us now in the shape of the ever increasing price of credits.''

HEADLINE: China's Trade Growth Stronger Than Expected

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's exports and imports grew much more firmly than expected last month, figures showed Friday, fanning expectations that Beijing will soon raise interest rates further to fight rising inflation. 
The strong trade figures are also likely to stoke a debate in Congress that China's currency is undervalued against the dollar, undermining American jobs and competitiveness.
Exports rose 35 percent from a year earlier, and imports rose nearly 38 percent, easily topping analyst forecasts for increases of about 24 percent on both fronts.
The figures, released Friday by the Chinese customs agency, showed that demand within China has remained surprisingly strong, despite efforts to rein in the blistering pace of growth and the inflation pressures that have built up as a result.
Analysts believe that inflation data for November, due Saturday, will show that price increases accelerated substantially from the 4.4 percent reading in October, and that inflation will remain higher than the authorities would like for some time.
Last Friday, Chinese leaders said that monetary policy next year would shift from ''relatively loose'' to ''prudent,'' an announcement that has been widely interpreted as heralding another rate increase.
The strong export growth revealed on Friday could also give Beijing the confidence that China's export sector could cope with any monetary tightening despite the slight appreciation of its currency, the renminbi, in recent months, analysts said.

HEADLINE: San Diego House Is Burned Down, for Safety's Sake

 BODY:
The authorities in San Diego County burned down a house filled with explosives on Thursday after determining that removal of the volatile clutter of chemicals, detonators and grenades would be too dangerous. 
Officials discovered the hazardous house in Escondido last month after a gardener stepped on a homemade bomb in the yard. When county sheriffs and F.B.I. agents tried to enter, they found so many explosive materials lying about, in containers and loose piles, that they abandoned their search.
Later, a bomb squad collected samples including PETN, which was used in 2001 when a man on an airplane tried to ignite a bomb in his shoe, and HMBT, which can explode when stepped on.
The house was rented by George D. Jakubec, 54, an unemployed software consultant. He has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of making explosives and robbing three banks with firearms. Prosecutors have declined to say why they think Mr. Jakubec assembled the jumbled arsenal, saying on Thursday that ''the investigation is ongoing.''
Officials determined that a quick, hot fire would neutralize the dangerous chemicals in the house, and on Thursday they closed Interstate 15 and evacuated neighbors.
As the embers smoldered the officials said that air-quality monitors in the neighborhood had not detected hazardous fumes. They said they did not plan to compensate the owner of the house for the loss.

HEADLINE: From Queens, Support For a Dissident

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It took Sharon K. Hom two and a half hours on Wednesday evening to get by hired car from her home in Bayside, Queens, to Newark Liberty International Airport, a distance of about 22 miles. Much of the time was spent crawling, and barely at that, through the Lincoln Tunnel. Ms. Hom began to worry that she might miss her flight to Oslo.
Being trapped seemingly forever in the Lincoln Tunnel is almost enough to make anyone think of herself as the victim of human-rights deprivation. Tempting as that feeling might have been, Ms. Hom was far too familiar with true rights abuses to succumb. 
She is executive director of Human Rights in China, an organization with offices in the Empire State Building that stands for exactly what the name says it does. She was on her way to Oslo having been invited to be present on Friday when the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize is formally awarded to the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo.
Mr. Liu, branded a criminal by the Chinese leadership, committed a terrible sin in a country that may be a modern economic titan but still harbors primitive attitudes in regard to free expression. He dared to think. Worse, he dared to speak. Worse yet, he dared to write. And because he thought and spoke and wrote about democracy and human rights, he was sentenced last December to 11 years behind bars.
Ms. Hom's group translated some of Mr. Liu's essays into English and published them, and it has worked to focus international attention on his confinement.
All sorts of individual rights are equal, the Hong Kong-born Ms. Hom said, but ''freedom of expression and the right to access information'' may be considered first among equals.
They form ''an enabling right that allows you to exercise all the others,'' she said.
Mr. Liu will obviously not be in Oslo on Friday. Nor will his wife, Liu Xia, who is under house arrest. For the first time since 1936, no one will be present in the Norwegian capital to accept the peace medal. But Mr. Liu will not lack for people speaking in his behalf.
In New York, Human Rights in China and other rights groups plan to rally on Friday at 9 a.m. across First Avenue from the United Nations. In the evening, a 1994 documentary called ''Moving the Mountain,'' about the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising, will be shown in TriBeCa under the aegis of the Culture Project.
That the Nobel Peace Prize amounts to a political statement is a given. Some country or another, some group or another, is left fuming almost every year. Many people are still scratching their heads over what the rookie American president, Barack Obama, did to deserve the 2009 medal.
But China's reaction has been over the top. Its bombastic language and its naked bullying would almost be laughable were the stakes not so high.
CHINA has suspended trade negotiations with Norway. It has leaned on other countries to boycott the Nobel ceremony. At least 17 countries -- including pillars of democracy like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Sudan and Cuba -- say they will not attend. China has denounced the Nobel committee as a bunch of ''clowns,'' and has gone so far as to concoct an alternate ''Confucius Peace Prize'' of its own.
''China's reaction is nothing new,'' Ms. Hom said. ''In one shot, it has shown its true face, which is that it's a bully and will not tolerate critical views. The tone is very much like the Cultural Revolution's Red Guards, and it's not an encouraging tone for an important member of the international community.''
''To call the Nobel committee clowns just shows they've gone overboard,'' she said. ''They really have lost all sense of proportion.''
If anything, she added, this ''absolutely politically tone-deaf'' reaction serves to ''vindicate the decision to give the prize to Liu Xiaobo, because it shows how there isn't any tolerance for different views.''
Though she cut it close, Ms. Hom did make her flight. On Thursday, she collected her credentials for the Nobel ceremony and related events. As she picked them up, she said by phone from Oslo, she felt ''totally overwhelmed.''
''It suddenly hit me how incredibly important this event is,'' she said. ''This is a moment that really recognizes the importance of what Liu Xiaobo stands for -- the price he's paying for exercising just fundamentally what human beings are about, which is to express themselves, to connect to other human beings.''

HEADLINE: Guys, Kiss Mom and Come Out Fighting

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
With the possible exception of the romantic comedy, no film genre is more strictly governed by conventions -- or enslaved by cliches, if you prefer -- than the boxing picture. Something similar might be said about reviews of boxing pictures, so here goes:
''The Fighter,'' directed by David O. Russell and based on the true story of the junior welterweight Micky Ward, is quick on its feet and packs a mighty punch. With solid bodywork, clever feints and tremendous heart, it scores at least a TKO, by which I mean both that it falls just short of overpowering greatness -- I can't quite exclaim, ''It's a knockout!'' -- and that the most impressive thing about it is technique. 
By the time this film -- which was written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson, and shepherded into existence by Mark Wahlberg, who plays Mr. Ward -- reaches its rousing and brutal final rounds, it may feel a bit familiar. Not necessarily because the story of Mr. Ward's career is so well known (his most famous bouts, in particular his three extraordinary meetings with Arturo Gatti in 2002 and 2003, do not fall within the movie's scope), but rather because the shape of the narrative recalls so many other fight movies. This is yet another tale of an underdog battling long odds and stubborn adversity in search of a shot at the big time.
It is also a love story, a family melodrama and the chronicle of a close and complicated fraternal relationship. The love of a good woman (the unaffectedly lovable Amy Adams), the rivalry and camaraderie between brothers, the battered face, bruised knuckles and wounded pride -- ''The Fighter'' has it all.
But the inevitable comparisons arise only in retrospect, when it settles down into the company of ''Rocky'' and ''Raging Bull'' and other very good (and Best Picture-nominated) boxing pictures. Mr. Russell, a restlessly -- sometimes recklessly -- inventive filmmaker, does not try to subvert the genre, but rather, as Clint Eastwood did in ''Million Dollar Baby,'' to refresh it, to find new insights and angles of vision within the parameters of the tried and true.
Sticking fairly closely to the facts of Mr. Ward's story, ''The Fighter'' also plants itself firmly in his native terrain of Lowell, Mass., immersing the viewer, especially in early scenes, in the sensorium of a hard-luck industrial town left to languish in the backwash of globalization. The voices of the citizens are angry, irreverent and profane. The light is flat and unlovely. You can almost smell the weariness and desperation rising off of the tar that Micky, in his day job as a road paver, spreads on streets lined with sagging three-decker houses and faded storefronts. A city with a distinguished place in American labor and literary history -- it was the birthplace of Jack Kerouac -- Lowell in the early 1990s, when ''The Fighter'' unfolds, is blighted by poverty, unemployment and the crack epidemic, which has claimed Micky's half brother, Dicky Eklund, as a casualty.
This last bit of information emerges piecemeal, through a scrim of family denial and addict dissembling, but as soon as we see Dicky, played by a gaunt and antic Christian Bale, we know something is wrong. His eyes dart, his mouth draws back into a nervous rictus, and his shuffling, splayed walk conveys neurological damage. Dicky is also amusing, sensitive and quick witted, a ball of comic charm able, just barely, to juggle his addiction with his commitment to his brother and their mother, Alice (Melissa Leo).
Mr. Bale's performance is astonishing, in part because he so completely conquers a daunting set of physical and psychological challenges. Dicky is not only an addict but also an athlete in his own right, a former boxer who clings to, and endlessly relives, a single moment of glory. He tells everyone who will listen that he once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard, and while the facts of the episode are in dispute, his pugilistic skill and intelligence are never in doubt.
In a crucial scene, having attempted a remarkably stupid caper, he finds himself fleeing the Lowell police, his long limbs flapping like a cartoon character's as he high-tails it down the street. Then, as Dicky stops and squares off to throw an ill-advised punch, he snaps suddenly from clown to gladiator. You see that his core of talent and discipline has not been completely destroyed by drugs, even if his judgment and self-respect have. You also see that this funny, exasperating character is really a walking, flailing tragedy, for himself and just about everyone around him.
It is this rhythm -- the light, syncopated footwork of comedy setting up stinging jabs of pathos -- that makes ''The Fighter'' so lively, so surprising and so moving. At least since ''Flirting With Disaster,'' his breakthrough comedy from 1996, Mr. Russell has exhibited a bracingly kinetic directing style, for better and for worse: ''Three Kings'' flies like a bullet aimed at the contradictions of American global power, while ''I Heart Huckabees'' spins manically like a hamster's wheel, blurring its provocative ideas into tiresome intellectual attitudes.
Mr. Russell came late to ''The Fighter,'' hired on after other directors had fallen through, and the project seems at once to have unleashed and reined in his extraordinary energies. He and the cast are confident enough to plunge into the richest contradictions and deepest complications of Micky Ward's life and milieu. (The Ward-Eklund family cooperated with the filmmakers, and one of their friends, Mickey O'Keefe, plays himself on screen.)
The American working class, in its Northern and Southern Caucasian manifestations, tends to be portrayed in movies either with glib mockery or with an equally condescending solemnity. Micky and Dicky and their clan -- seven sisters and that powerhouse of a mother -- are vulgar, vicious, loyal, hilarious and a hundred other things, that is, entirely and sometimes embarrassingly human. To say that this family is dysfunctional would be both to understate its troubles and to narrow the film's scope, which encompasses ethics, sociology and economics as well as psychology.
Alice, flanked by those seven Fury-like daughters -- and occasionally, weakly challenged by her husband (Jack McGee) -- stands out in an increasingly crowded field of monstrous movie matriarchs. (See also Mo'Nique in ''Precious,''Barbara Hershey in ''Black Swan'' and Mother Gothel, voiced by Donna Murphy, in ''Tangled.'') She and Dicky, her obvious favorite, are supposedly supporting and promoting Micky, but they always seem to undermine his chances for success, which may be their deeper intention. He can never be allowed to surpass his brother, or to think that he's better than the rest of the family.
And ''The Fighter,'' while it persuasively details Micky's travails in the ring, is more centrally about the fight between Alice and Charlene, his girlfriend, over control of his destiny. Ms. Leo, smoking and raging, as if preparing either to burn Lowell down or kick it to pieces, is a formidable presence, but she is matched by Ms. Adams, whose soft, sweet features disguise a will of steel. The best and hardest punch in a movie full of flying fists is thrown by her.
Mr. Wahlberg, for his part, leans back against the ropes and watches, underplaying so gracefully and with so little vanity that you almost forget that the movie is supposed to be about Micky. Everyone else seems to do a lot more fighting than the ostensible title character. But the brilliance of Mr. Wahlberg's quiet performance is that it so effectively mirrors the deep logic of the story, which is finally about the paradox of a man in a violent profession who is fundamentally passive and who must learn how to find some distance from the people who love and need him the most without abandoning them or betraying himself.
''The Fighter'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violent boxing sequences, drug use, obscenity and a bit of sex, though not enough to sap its strength.

HEADLINE: New York City Sues State Over the Cost of Housing Juveniles in Prisons

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Taking a contentious step intended to shake up the state's troubled juvenile prison system, New York City is suing the state, claiming it overcharged tens of millions of dollars a year for housing many of the city's young offenders in upstate jails.
The suit, which was filed last month in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, surprised and incensed state officials, who had been trying for months to hammer out an agreement on the issue with the Bloomberg administration. 
It is unusual, lawyers said, for the city to sue the state, especially over a budget dispute. But the suit reflects the severity of the impasse in an increasingly urgent debate over how to improve New York's system of juvenile prisons.
A state task force reported a year ago that young people battling addiction or mental illness were often grouped with violent offenders in substandard facilities where physical abuse is routine and counseling rare.
A suit brought by the Legal Aid Society in federal court last December contended that the Office of Children and Family Services, the state agency that runs the prisons, had failed to offer adequate mental health services. In July, the state agreed to place four of its most dangerous youth prisons under federal oversight.
What makes the city's lawsuit different is that it throws into public view an arcane but contentious budget process. The timing could not be more delicate, since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has made the issue of improving the juvenile justice system a high priority, as has the governor-elect, Andrew M. Cuomo.
Jeremy Travis, president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who is a member of the state task force, said the lawsuit brought the issue ''out of the twilight and into the spotlight.''
To city officials, the lawsuit is an unfortunate but necessary step to prod the state into acting more responsibly and to give Mr. Bloomberg more control over the city's juvenile offenders. The city would like the state to speed up its efforts to transfer more juveniles from remote state facilities to local programs that advocates for young offenders say are more effective in reducing recidivism.
''We don't particularly like leading this fight on a complaint about the cost,'' Deputy Mayor Linda I. Gibbs said. ''But we have to use every tool that we have, because the way that the current system works makes it impossible to say that you're using taxpayer money most effectively.
''Our frustration is over the state's reluctance to act and putting special interests before the best interests of the kids.''
In a statement, Susan Steele, a spokeswoman for the state's Office of Children and Family Services, said that since the city opted to sue, the state agency ''cannot comment or discuss specifics that could influence the outcome of the litigation.''
''We will let the legal process unfold and await the outcome,'' she continued.
Privately, though, state officials say that they were taken aback.
''We're very surprised that the city resorted to this, because a lawsuit is not the best vehicle to engage in conversation,'' said one high-ranking state official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the litigation. The official said the city's tactics seemed to be intended to force the state to bargain.
The state is expected to respond formally to the lawsuit by January.
State law requires the state to split the total costs of holding juvenile offenders with local governments. The state sets a per diem rate each year for services, like foster care, secure and less-restrictive residential services and community residential facilities for those offenders.
In the last decade, the number of youths sent to the state's juvenile centers has dropped to roughly 700 -- 400 of whom are from New York City -- from 2,300. Yet, according to the lawsuit, the per diem rates for services have more than tripled. As a result, the city is actually spending more money now -- $62 million -- than it did a decade ago, even though there are far fewer youths in the system. Part of what the city wants is a recalculation of those rates.
The suit claims that rate increases over the years ''divert city funds that would otherwise be available to expand and provide these services to pay instead for a costly idle system.''
The Bloomberg administration has become more interested in the state's youth prisons. In January, the mayor announced that the city's Department of Juvenile Justice would be folded into the Administration for Children's Services so the city could offer more community-based services to juveniles who did not pose a risk to public safety.
''The bottom line for us is we feel that we have demonstrated that local control works, because it preserves ties to family and education,'' said John Feinblatt, the mayor's chief adviser for policy and strategic planning.
The state does not disagree with those general goals. Gladys Carrion, the commissioner of the Office of Children and Family Services, has been praised by advocates for troubled youths for moving aggressively to close 16 youth prisons, reduce the number of youths in state custody and limit the use of force on those who remain.
Mr. Cuomo visited the Tryon Residential Center for Boys in Johnstown -- which has recently had significantly more staff than prisoners -- to call attention to what he views as wasteful spending.
But the state cannot close facilities rapidly because it must give a year's notice before juvenile detention centers or adult prisons can be shut down. Unions and upstate legislators have been resistant to such closings because the detention centers provide hundreds of jobs in economically distressed parts of the state.
Advocates for juveniles in the state system have mixed feelings about the lawsuit, but hope the city and the state can resolve their dispute quickly.
''What is fundamentally at stake in all juvenile justice reform transcends money,'' said Gabrielle Prisco, director of the Juvenile Justice Project at the Correctional Association of New York. ''Given what we know about the current problems in both the city and state facilities, any juvenile justice system, regardless of who runs it, must include independent external monitoring and increased diversion.
''The well-being of young people and the safety of the public hang in the balance.''

HEADLINE: America's High School Graduation Rate

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Report Finds Signs of Progress in Tackling School Dropout Rates'' (news article, Nov. 30) notes that America's high school graduation rate has increased to 75 percent in 2008 from 72 percent in 2001. 
While this is positive news, the fact remains that one-quarter of our teenagers are dropping out of school and setting themselves up for a lifetime of hardship and putting our nation at an educational and economic disadvantage in today's global economy. Put that way, I would not characterize the increase as ''turning a corner'' for the United States.
While this rate is one measure of success for our educational system, it should not be the only criterion. We must arm students with well-defined academic and career paths and ensure that they are truly college- and/or work force-ready, not simply with diploma in hand.
If we are to maintain our standing as a world leader and meet President Obama's 2020 Challenge, we must aim higher.

HEADLINE: Revised Fed Data Raises Doubt on Foreign Appetite for Build America Bonds

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Amid growing worries about state budget deficits and pension burdens, one bright spot in the municipal bond market has been data showing that foreign investment had climbed to record-setting levels.
The surge was widely credited to foreign interest in the taxable bonds that dozens of states have issued under the Build America Bond program. Enacted in early 2009, the program gives state and local issuers a federal subsidy that offsets the higher interest rates they would otherwise pay to issue taxable bonds.
On Thursday, with Congress still debating whether to extend the Build America Bond subsidy beyond the end of the year, the Federal Reserve released data for the third quarter on foreign holdings of municipal securities -- and revised all the quarterly numbers going back to mid-2009. 
The result? The evidence of growing foreign interest vanished.
The revised numbers show that foreign holdings of municipal securities have remained essentially flat since the end of 2008, as has the amount of new bonds purchased each quarter.
The new numbers muddle the picture of how the Build America Bond program is working just when clarity would be useful to the Congressional debate.
The Obama administration is allied with state treasurers and the Senate Democratic leadership in pushing for renewal, arguing that the program eases the state budget pinch by cutting borrowing costs and gets job-creating projects up and rolling in an anemic economy.
Critics like Senator Jon Kyl, the Arizona Republican who has emerged as an influential figure in the current Congressional tax negotiations, say the program's subsidy adds to the federal deficit and encourages states to borrow too much and take on more risk than they should.
When the program was originally adopted, as part of the financial stimulus plan in February 2009, one of its selling points was that it would increase investor demand -- and thereby cut borrowing costs -- by broadening the market for state debt issues to endowments, pension funds and foreign buyers.
Since those buyers do not pay federal income taxes, they are not interested in tax-exempt municipal bonds. The theory was that they might be interested in taxable municipal bonds, especially those maturing in 20 years or more -- rare in the corporate bond market.
And the Fed's quarterly numbers seemed to document that the program was delivering on that promise -- until Thursday.
A spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve said the explanation for the drastic revision is that the Fed ''reviewed and revised the methodology it had been using to estimate those numbers,'' and applied the new methodology retroactively to mid-2009.
Those new numbers show that foreign investors held $50.5 billion of municipal bonds in 2008, up from $45.1 billion in 2007. In the subsequent quarters, foreign holdings have fluctuated from $49.5 billion in the second quarter of 2009 to $52 billion, most recently.
But some people on Wall Street who actually sell municipal bonds are not buying the Fed's new calculations.
''The reason I know that foreign holdings are going up was never the Fed data,'' said one municipal bond banker in New York. ''The reason I know foreign holdings are going up is that I am selling more and more muni bonds to foreigner investors.''
And no wonder. Since the Build America program began, major banks have added municipal bond sales personnel in foreign offices, conducted tutorials for foreign institutional investors in London, increased travel budgets for their public finance teams and arranged video conference calls that allow foreign investors to quiz state officials about pending deals.
As a result, one bank said the number of foreign investors actively bidding on major taxable state bond deals has increased to as many as 200 in recent weeks, from a few dozen in 2008. Since more than a thousand foreign buyers regularly shop in America's taxable corporate bond market, Wall Street sees plenty of room to expand the taxable municipal audience -- unless, of course, Congress shuts down the show.

HEADLINE: In Lee Sweepstakes, Yanks Make Bid Count

BYLINE: By BEN SHPIGEL

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Brian Cashman spoke over the phone Thursday morning with Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees' managing general partner, and made a promise.
''I told him today that we were going to get a left-handed starter,'' Cashman said. The Yankees got their man, paying $50,000 to select Robert Fish in the Rule 5 draft. A bigger prize -- much bigger -- looms, and the Yankees on Thursday redoubled their efforts to make sure they get him, too.
Less than 24 hours after offering Cliff Lee a six-year contract worth about $140 million, the Yankees sweetened the deal by adding a guaranteed seventh year, a development that probably tilts the sweepstakes in their favor while putting pressure on the Texas Rangers, their primary competition, to evaluate their place in the escalating market. 
The Yankees had been insistent on capping their offer at six years, but that was before Carl Crawford eliminated any leverage they had in their negotiations with Lee by agreeing late Wednesday night to a seven-year, $142 million deal with the Boston Red Sox.
It was also before the Red Sox continued reloading, adding Crawford to a lineup that now includes first baseman Adrian Gonzalez and putting pressure on the Yankees to answer back.
Cashman, of course, tried to maintain that nothing had really changed, even though it had.
''Our desire is the same today as it was prior to that signing,'' he said, referring to Crawford. ''I don't think you can increase it any more. We have significant interest in Cliff Lee, and we've communicated that.''
Surrounded by reporters in a hotel hallway Thursday morning, Cashman congratulated Boston for a shrewd signing but was hardly flustered by it. All along, the 32-year-old Lee has been his focus. Even though Cashman has stressed the importance of signing him, he seemed relaxed talking about Lee, content to see how the story unfolds.
''I know what we're willing to do, and the player and his agent know what we're willing to do,'' Cashman said. ''I can't tell you if it's two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 years. We know, they know, that's all that matters.''
Jon Daniels, the Rangers' general manager, declined any detailed comment when asked whether the Yankees' improved offer affected Texas' plans, but then invited reporters to ''draw your own conclusions.''
That almost sounded as if he were resigned to finishing second in the Lee sweepstakes, but the Rangers were not giving up that easily. They quickly sent a contingent of club officials, including the team's chief executive officer, Chuck Greenberg, to meet with Lee and his agent, Darek Braunecker, in Arkansas.
It was the third visit Rangers officials have made to Lee in recent weeks, underlining their determination to compete with the Yankees.
In a conference call with reporters Thursday night, Greenberg said the visit lasted about 90 minutes and that the Rangers left feeling ''very good about the discussion.''
''We didn't press them,'' Greenberg said. ''We gave them a considerable amount of new information to reflect upon.''
And, Greenberg added, ''I believe we made an impression.''
One element in the Rangers' favor is the absence of a state income tax in Texas. Still, the Yankees' latest offer seemed to gnaw at Nolan Ryan, the Rangers' president, who told ESPN radio on Thursday morning that ''seven years is really stretching it out.''
''I don't know how you predict how anyone is performing six or seven years from now,'' he said, adding that deals reach a threshold where they no longer make economic sense.
Although the total value of the Yankees' revised proposal was not immediately known, Lee's six-year offer put him in line to receive more money annually -- $23.3 million -- than any other major league starter, including C. C. Sabathia, who makes $23 million a year over the length of his seven-year, $161 million pact.
When the Yankees gave Sabathia seven years in December 2008, they felt they had to do whatever was necessary to get back to the postseason.
The signings of A. J. Burnett and Mark Teixeira then followed, along with a World Series championship. Now the Red Sox have similar visions. In less than a week they have added two of the premier left-handed hitters in baseball and moved the majority of their offense from one side of the plate to the other.
Boston's new left-handed-heavy lineup -- Gonzalez, Crawford, David Ortiz, J. D. Drew, Jacoby Ellsbury -- mandates that the Yankees will have to counter. Ideally, their rotation in 2011 would have three left-handers in Sabathia, Andy Pettitte and Lee, pitchers who have held Crawford to just six extra-base hits in 133 at-bats.
Gonzalez has never faced Lee, but is 1 for 8 with five strikeouts against Sabathia and 1 for 8 with three strikeouts off Pettitte. The Yankees will also move to add at least one more left-hander in the bullpen to join Boone Logan. But Boston, which is rebuilding its bullpen, may be eyeing some of the same relievers the Yankees are. Both teams now also find themselves bidding for Russell Martin, the two-time All-Star catcher whom the Los Angeles Dodgers allowed to become a free agent.
The relievers won't cost a ton of money; nor will Martin, who is recovering from a hip fracture.
But Lee will, and the Yankees are hoping Texas can't match their offer. Unlike in 2008, when he visited Pettitte in Texas on his way home after the winter meetings, Cashman flew straight to New York on Thursday. He did so with a $50,000 left-hander in his possession, and with another left-hander -- the one he truly, desperately wants -- in reach.

HEADLINE: Will Losing Season Be Financial Loss For Longhorns?

BYLINE: By REEVE HAMILTON. 
rhamilton@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Since the Longhorns won college football's 2005 national championship, the University of Texas at Austin has topped the Collegiate Licensing Company's annual ranking of schools making the most off merchandise sales.
From 1998 to 2010, by following the marketing and branding lead of commercially vibrant entities like the Cowboys and Apple, the university increased its merchandising royalties from $600,000 to, most recently, a one-year haul of more than $10.1 million that was split between the athletics department and the president's office.
Not coincidentally, during that period the Longhorns excelled on the football field, winning at least nine games each season. This year, however, was different. The recently -- some might add prematurely -- completed 2010 season was the team's first losing record since 1997, ending without a bowl game. 
After enjoying the merchandising benefits of prolonged success, what will be the cost of failure?
''That's the big question I have,'' said Craig Westemeier, U.T.-Austin's director of trademark licensing.
Mr. Westemeier has been preparing for such an eventuality, confident that his university's brand is not reliant on athletic success. ''This will be a good challenge to see what we've been able to do, how we've been able to establish ourselves and what we can do overall as a program,'' he said.
A bigger question is this: How will the Longhorns' poor performance affect the university's $3 billion capital campaign?
University officials anxiously await the answer as they brace for state-mandated budget cuts. Early indications are that higher education will bear the brunt as legislators begin hacking chunks out of a budget that has an anticipated shortfall of at least $20 billion. In the fall, when state leaders asked for 5 percent to be trimmed from the current biennium's budget, more than 40 percent of those cuts came out of higher education.
The upshot is that all university operations will be increasingly reliant on private donations -- and that potentially ties back to sports, football in particular.
''There's no question that donors get more excited about winning, but I don't think this past season will have any effect on fund-raising,'' said Red McCombs, a billionaire and former owner of the Minnesota Vikings who is one of the Longhorns' biggest boosters. (Mr. McCombs is a $50,000 donor to The Texas Tribune.) Enough confidence remains in the program, he said, to allow it to weather what he assumes will be a brief trip to the bottom of the Big 12.
Of course, that could change, he said.
Discussing the generosity of donors like him who made possible the $176.5 million project that recently added more than 13,000 seats to Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, he asked, ''Would that have been the same if we had gone 3 and 8 the five years prior to that? Probably not.''
Mr. McCombs, who said he was far more concerned about the stature of the University of Texas business school named for him than that of the football team, said he believed that athletic success ''definitely translates'' to gifts to the university.
Others do not agree. ''Historically, we have not seen a correlation with a bad football season and the general giving to a capital campaign or the academic side to the university,'' said John McCall, U.T.-Austin's associate vice president for development.
In a 2009 report commissioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, Jonathan Orszag, an economist, came to a similar conclusion, finding no significant correlation between athletic success and giving to a university.
Still, universities throughout Texas view football as an ingredient of institutional improvement.
''I don't think you have to have an athletic program to be a national research university, but having a good one validates you in some way,'' said Diana Natalicio, president of the University of Texas at El Paso, which is currently in a seven-way race to be the state's next Tier One university.
Victor J. Boschini Jr., chancellor of Texas Christian University, currently the state's most successful football team, the Rose Bowl-bound Horned Frogs, agreed that the benefits of a strong athletic program were indirect.
''If presidents and boards were honest at every school,'' Mr. Boschini said, ''they would say you cannot go into athletics to make money. I just don't think, nowadays, that it's possible.''
But in good times, he said, the money comes back in many intangible ways like increased applications and private donations. ''My gut, from working at 11 schools, is that it makes a difference,'' Mr. Boschini said.
The Cardinals of Lamar University in Beaumont just finished their first season of gridiron play (5-6) since the team was dismantled in 1989 due to lack of interest. The enhancements that Lamar officials attribute to the sport's return include record enrollments and the growth of the music program to accommodate a marching band. The number of vendors licensed to produce Lamar merchandise has doubled, and sales of Lamar gear rose 550 percent in the last year. All of that money currently goes back into the athletics department.
''That may change once we start making more,'' said Larry Acker, Lamar's assistant director of public relations.
Or it may not. In August, the N.C.A.A. released a report on revenues and expenses in Division I programs around the country that found that athletic departments were increasingly reliant on university subsidies.
U.T.-Austin is the exception, with one of the few self-sustaining athletic departments in the nation. Anyway, Mr. McCall said, the sense among Longhorns is that ''people aren't jumping off the ship'' just yet, despite a disappointing season.
''This is a blip at this point,'' he said. ''It's not a trend.''

HEADLINE: 9/11 Health Bill Blocked in U.S. Senate, but Backers Hold Hope

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Republican senators blocked Democratic legislation on Thursday that sought to provide medical care to rescue workers and others who became ill as a result of breathing in toxic fumes, dust and smoke at the site of the World Trade Center attack in 2001.
The 9/11 health bill, a version of which was approved by the House of Representatives in September, was among several initiatives that Senate Democrats had hoped to approve before the close of the 111th Congress. Supporters believe this was their last real opportunity to have the bill passed. 
The action by the Senate created huge uncertainty over the bill's future. Its proponents were working on Thursday to salvage the legislation, with one possibility being to have it inserted into a large tax-cut bill that Republicans and Democrats are trying to pass before Congress ends its current session.
Such a move seemed unlikely, since it might complicate passage of the tax package, which includes a provision that President Obama sought in return for backing the continuation of tax cuts for all income levels that Republicans wanted: an extension of unemployment benefits.
In a vote largely along party lines, the Senate rejected a procedural move by Democrats to end debate on the 9/11 health bill and to bring it to a vote; 60 yes votes were needed, but the move received 57, with 42 votes against.
Republicans have been raising concerns about how to pay for the $7.4 billion measure, while Democrats, led by Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York, have argued that there was a moral obligation to assist those who put their lives at risk during rescue and cleanup operations at ground zero.
The bill is formally known as the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, named after a New York police detective who participated in the rescue efforts at ground zero. He later developed breathing complications that were common to first responders at the site, and he died in January 2006. The cause of his death became a source of debate after the city's medical examiner concluded that it was not directly related to the attacks.
After the vote, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, a chief sponsor of the bill in the House, argued that Democrats should include the 9/11 health bill in the larger tax-cut legislation and, in the process, dare Republicans to oppose it in that context. Ms. Maloney added that the tax bill was the one piece of legislation that ''Republicans won't leave this town without passing.''
As the day wore on, it appeared increasingly unlikely that the Senate would include a provision providing health care for ground zero workers in any tax package it brought to the floor, according to senior Capitol Hill officials. But supporters of the 9/11 legislation said there was a possibility they could persuade Democratic leaders in the House to include it in any tax-cut plan that the chamber approved and win Senate approval during negotiations over differences in measures passed by the two chambers.
The Senate action was a blow to sponsors of the bill, who mobilized a network of allies across the political spectrum to lobby on its behalf, including the New York City police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Ms. Gillibrand, the chief sponsor in the Senate, even reached out to former President George W. Bush. But her aides say Mr. Bush did not respond to her entreaties.
In a statement, the mayor chastised Senate Republicans for their ''wrongheaded political strategy'' and called on them to allow a floor vote on the bill. ''The attacks of 9/11 were attacks on America,'' he said, ''and we have a collective responsibility to care for the heroes, from all 50 states, who answered the call of duty, saved lives and helped our nation recover.''
The bill calls for providing $3.2 billion over the next eight years to monitor and treat injuries stemming from exposure to toxic dust and debris at ground zero. New York City would pay 10 percent of those health costs.
The bill would also set aside $4.2 billion to reopen the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund to provide payments for job and economic losses.
In addition, the bill includes a provision that would allow money from the Victim Compensation Fund to be paid to any eligible claimant who receives a payment under the settlement of lawsuits that 10,000 rescue and cleanup workers recently reached with the city.
Now, those who receive a settlement from the city are limited in how much compensation they can get from the fund, according to the bill's sponsors.
There are nearly 60,000 people enrolled in health monitoring and treatment programs related to the 9/11 attacks, according to the sponsors of the bill. The federal government provides the bulk of the money for those programs.
If the bill is not adopted by the current Congress, its supporters will have start over again next year. With Republicans set to take control of the House, passing the bill in that chamber will be extremely difficult, the bill's supporters say. That is a large part of the reason backers of the measure were pleading with Senate leaders to get it passed by this Congress.

HEADLINE: Warsaw Makes a Bid to Be Central Europe's Financial Hub

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
Adam Lach for The International Herald TribuneLudiwk Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
WARSAW - It may come as a surprise to some people that the upstart Warsaw Stock Exchange has surpassed the venerable Vienna exchange in trading volume, but to Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Polish bourse, this is old news indeed.
''The time has passed when we defined our position versus Vienna,'' Mr. Sobolewski said in an interview in his sleek office inside the exchange building in downtown Warsaw, where visitors wait to see him in a room decorated with a large tank of piranhas. 
Instead, Mr. Sobolewski, a 45-year-old lawyer, is already measuring his institution against European giants like the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt. With 32 initial public offerings in the third quarter of this year, he can already claim to have surpassed them in the number, if not the market value, of new listings.
In July, Warsaw signed a contract to use the NYSE Euronext trading platform, making it easier for American investors to trade shares from Poland and other countries in the region that are listed on the exchange. The agreement is part of Mr. Sobolewski's plan to make Warsaw the dominant exchange for Central Europe, with listings from countries like Romania and Ukraine and others as far south as the Balkans.
Mr. Sobolewski's ambitions reflect a shift in the economic center of gravity in Europe. As the only country in the European Union to escape recession during the financial crisis, Poland has become a magnet for foreign investment. While much of Europe is still climbing out of recession, Poland is expected to grow more than 4 percent next year, after 3.6 percent in 2010.
Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive and a co-founder of the Blackstone Group, has his eyes on the region. He told an audience in New York on Tuesday that an acquisition in Central Europe would be ''really neat'' if regional economies held up.
A government privatization wave has drawn investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, which have opened offices in Warsaw in the last year. One of the biggest privatizations was the Warsaw Stock Exchange itself, whose shares soared 18 percent promptly after an initial public offering on Nov. 9.
''Everyone wants to have a piece of Polish action,'' Artur Tomala, head of Goldman Sachs Poland, said last week at a conference sponsored in part by The International Herald Tribune.
Warsaw may be one of the few places left in Europe where investment banks are still welcomed warmly.
''I can't imagine having such a broad privatization program without cooperating with investment banks,'' Aleksander Grad, the Polish treasury minister, said in an interview.
Vienna, as the former capital of the Hapsburg dynasty, has a historical claim to be Central Europe's financial center. Austrian institutions like Erste Bank are deeply embedded in the region.
But the Austrian banks emerged bruised from the financial crisis, while Polish institutions escaped relatively unscathed because of their low exposure to troubled foreign assets.
Now, Warsaw is trying to sell itself as a capital that offers growth, without the overexuberance that ended in tears so many other places.
''For an effective financial center what we need above all is a stability culture,'' Jacek Rostowski, the Polish finance minister, said at the conference.
''We have not had the kind of excessively rapid growth that other countries have seen,'' said Mr. Rostowski, who promised that Poland would exercise tight supervision over its financial sector.
To be sure, the CEE Stock Exchange Group, an alliance of the exchanges in Vienna, Budapest, Prague and Ljuljana, Slovenia, still has more trading volume collectively than Warsaw.
Beatrix Exinger, a spokeswoman for the Vienna exchange, concedes that Warsaw has more initial public offerings. But she argues that the Vienna exchange, founded in 1771, is home to more blue-chip companies.
''We have less quantity but more quality,'' Ms. Exinger said.
While the Warsaw Stock Exchange had more new listings than any other European exchange from July through September, they were mostly small companies listed on the so-called NewConnect platform. The total value of the Warsaw I.P.O.'s was 60 million euros ($79.4 million), according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, compared with a total of 1.7 billion euros for the 20 new listings on the London Stock Exchange.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which promotes development in the former Soviet bloc countries, has expressed concern about the low level of liquidity in the Polish exchange, meaning that it can be difficult to find buyers or sellers for some shares.
Mr. Sobolewski agreed that ''liquidity is king,'' and outlined plans to attract listings from as far south as Bulgaria and Serbia. The exchange can already boast companies like Kernel Holdings, a maker of sunflower oil that is Ukraine's largest agricultural company. As Mr. Sobolewski pointed out, Warsaw still needs more of the professionals that are essential to a vibrant financial center, like auditors, lawyers, bank analysts and financial media.
''It is not ended, by far,'' he said. ''But the situation is better than a few years ago.''
There is also a risk that the Polish market, as one of the few growth stories in Europe, could become overheated from too much foreign investment. But no one in Warsaw seems to be worried about bubbles.
''It would be desirable to have more companies invested in Poland,'' Mr. Sobolewski said. ''We are still far from the point where it might be dangerous.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Trying Times, Sympathy Is a Tough Sell

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When the N.B.A. players union's proposed changes to the labor agreement that is scheduled to expire after the season became public on Wednesday, the news was met with the studied response reserved for an accountant's financial report.
The document obtained by The New York Times contained a number of nuggets. One eye-popping provision was that the union, which sold out 18-year-olds five years ago by agreeing to allow the N.B.A. to raise the age limit for players to 19, will now fight to lower it to 18. In 2005, the N.B.A. required incoming players to be at least 19 years old and one year removed from high school. Now the union is proposing that the N.B.A. adopt rules that ''incentivize high school and college athletes to attend school.'' 
There were other important provisions -- an offer to reduce the players' guarantee of 57 percent of revenue and one designed to free up player movement to make it easier for them to earn more money. Fans want to know how these proposals will affect their team. If a lockout occurs, then they pay attention to labor talks.
There was a time when professional athletes were depicted as the boys and girls next door. People who were ''just like us,'' except for their ability to run, throw, catch and hit. This perception has changed, and it's not clear that the athletes or the executives who head their unions understand the change.
Increasingly, professional athletes receive little sympathy from a fan base that has little patience with their so-called plight.
Earlier this week, the normally stoic Derek Jeter expressed irritation that his negotiations with the Yankees went public. Jeter was miffed that the Yankees said publicly that if the 36-year-old captain could get a better offer, he should take it.
''I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't angry about how some of this went,'' Jeter said.
Sure, it's the principle, not the money. Still, how miffed can you be? The Yankees forked over a three-year deal that will pay Jeter at least $51 million.
Then there is Albert Haynesworth, the Washington Redskins defensive lineman. On Wednesday, the Redskins suspended Haynesworth, the N.F.L.'s highest-paid defensive player, without pay for the final four games of the regular season for what they called conduct detrimental to the team. The suspension was the culmination of a nasty public war of words and deeds between Haynesworth and Coach Mike Shanahan.
As you listened to Haynesworth's comments during interviews, he seemed miffed that a large segment of the public cannot understand how he could sign a seven-year, $100 million contract and complain about his role. Again, it's the principle, not the money. Shanahan is not a players' favorite, and he has alienated parts of the locker room with his treatment of Donovan McNabb.
Still, in these fragile economic times when only the wealthy -- and that includes some athletes -- appear to be prospering, soliciting sympathy from the public is a hard sell for professional athletes. This is true even at the big-time college sports level.
At a time when many families struggle to send their children to college, the idea of athletes receiving so-called free rides only to major in basket weaving or have themselves expelled for disciplinary reasons creates a level of animosity that increases as times get harder and the sports spectacles become larger.
In the event of a lockout, N.F.L. and N.B.A. players may be surprised to discover that public sentiment rests, if not with owners, then certainly with the notion that players should be grateful for having the opportunity to play a game that most fans would play for free. There is a confusing contradiction at work. Listen to hours of talk radio and you would hear few, if any, fans ask owners ''how much is enough?'' or criticize their franchises for being overvalued. Yet there is a constant lament -- from the news media and the fans -- that players earn too much or are not worth what they earn.
This reflects the inherent ambivalence of many fans who see well-compensated athletes playing what appears to be children's games. Children's games, perhaps, but performed in multibillion-dollar industries.
As collective bargaining agreements expire, the heads of the players associations have to be more creative in presenting their cases to the public. They cannot equate cheers on the playing field with public support at the bargaining table.
Jeter may be justified in expressing his anger over negotiations gone public and Haynesworth may have a point about being misrepresented by the Redskins. The public, by and large, doesn't want to hear it. Millionaire players are not regarded as fellow workers. They are no longer seen as the boys and girls next door.

HEADLINE: Orszag, Former Budget Director, Joining Citi as a Vice Chairman

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
8:41 p.m. Updated Wall Street has long stacked its ranks with Washington types.
It is the elephant in the room of White House grand bargains: after building a reputation and Rolodex in politics, the wise man moves on - or in many cases, back - to the financial industry to make a killing.
A decade ago, a former Treasury secretary, Robert E. Rubin, left the Clinton administration to become a senior adviser and board member at Citigroup - collecting a $10 million a year paycheck with no management responsibility. 
On Thursday, Peter R. Orszag, President Obama's first budget director and a protege of Mr. Rubin, followed in his mentor's footsteps and joined Citi's investment banking group as a vice chairman.
Mr. Orszag, 41, is the second cabinet official to join Citi this month, and his appointment comes days after the Treasury Department's $10.5 billion stock offering helped further extricate the bailed out bank from Washington.
Last week, Carlos Gutierrez, a former commerce secretary under President George W. Bush, was named to a similar post.
Both men will become members of Citi's senior strategic advisory group, a counsel of political and financial hands that its bankers can bring into the most complex situations.
Mr. Orszag's actual duties are murky at best. He is expected to draw on his deep knowledge of public sector financial issues and his experience overseeing the federal budget to counsel Citi's clients on various policy actions. He is also expected to be something of a corporate rainmaker.
One client he cannot advise, however, is Uncle Sam. In keeping with federal ethics rules, Mr. Orszag is not allowed to have any contact with federal government officials.
Citigroup did not disclose Mr. Orszag's compensation. But being part of the inner circle of John Havens, the head of Citi's investment bank, he is likely to earn far more than he made as a member of the Obama cabinet.
Inside Citigroup, the guessing games have already begun about how many zeros will appear on his paycheck - as well as the requisite jokes about whether his package would pass muster with the federal pay czar. Such a job typically pays at least $2 million to $3 million, according to bankers.
Mr. Orszag's role is hardly unusual. Lehman Brothers famously hired Felix G. Rohatyn, the former Lazard banker who helped rescue New York City from bankruptcy. Arthur Levitt, the former S.E.C. chairman, and E. Gerald Corrigan, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, joined Goldman Sachs. JPMorgan Chase took in Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Britain, as a senior adviser and has a trophy case of global leaders on its international council.
Mr. Orszag was the youngest member of Mr. Obama's cabinet before resigning in July after a year and a half as budget director, a post in which he shaped the stimulus package and health care reform legislation. (His successor as budget director, Jacob J. Lew, is another former Citigroup executive.)
A graduate of Princeton and the London School of Economics, Mr. Orszag was an economic adviser in the Clinton administration, where he worked closely with Mr. Rubin.
After leaving the Clinton White House, Mr. Orszag became a fellow at the Brookings Institution, where he directed a research project that Mr. Rubin had helped found.
After Mr. Orszag left the administration in July, the two men were reunited when he secured an office at the Council on Foreign Relations, where Mr. Rubin became co-chairman when he left Citi in January 2009.
But Mr. Orszag also expressed an interest in becoming an investment banker and a desire to make money, according to people who know him. He had put feelers out to several financial institutions to test the waters.
At Citigroup, he approached Lewis B. Kaden, a vice chairman and longtime ally of Mr. Rubin, about a job, according to people briefed on the situation. But as talks intensified, Mr. Havens took over the discussions.
''I am pleased to be joining Citi, with its unmatched global platform and dedication to providing clients with service and advice,'' Mr. Orszag said in a statement.
Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Long Road for Lawyer Defending the Health Care Law

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Memo to the third floor at Justice Department headquarters: Ian Gershengorn will soon be pacing the corridors again.
When preparing for oral arguments in big cases, Mr. Gershengorn makes a habit of walking long laps around the building's rectangular core, first past the civil and antitrust divisions, then the Office of Professional Responsibility and the appellate branches, mumbling to himself while hunched over note cards. People try not to stare.
There has been a lot of pacing lately. Since March, it has fallen to Mr. Gershengorn, 43, a deputy assistant attorney general, to defend the Obama administration against nearly two dozen legal challenges to the president's health care overhaul. For the moment, the burden of defending the constitutionality of President Obama's signature legislative achievement falls squarely on Mr. Gershengorn and his team of more than a dozen litigators.
The health care cases have turned Mr. Gershengorn into something of a courthouse circuit-rider, traveling week after week to Virginia and then Florida and on to Michigan to repeat the same arguments. 
He faces perhaps his biggest test on Thursday when he returns to Pensacola, Fla., with the uphill task of turning around a federal district judge, Roger Vinson, whose preliminary rulings have been forthrightly antagonistic. The lawsuit was filed by governors and attorneys general from 20 states, all but one of them Republican.
The redundancy of the hearings has done little to ease Mr. Gershengorn's anxiety each time he prepares to represent the United States in a landmark case that will most likely be decided by the Supreme Court.
''It puts the fear of God in you a little bit,'' he said in an interview in his office. ''I start to get the feeling in the pit of my stomach. I start to pace around the building a little more, and become more irritable.'' Paraphrasing Samuel Johnson, he added: ''Nothing focuses the mind quite like an execution.''
For the time being, Mr. Gershengorn and his colleagues hold an unblemished record. In the only two cases where judges have ruled on the merits -- in Detroit and in Lynchburg, Va. -- the federal government has prevailed.
But a ruling is expected any day in Richmond, Va., where Judge Henry E. Hudson, like Judge Vinson, has expressed skepticism about the law's central provision, which requires most Americans to obtain insurance starting in 2014.
Mr. Gershengorn said he would not be surprised if district judges left the appellate courts to sort through a scramble of contradictory opinions.
''You try not to get too caught up in the ebb and flow of individual decisions,'' he said. ''I think we are right on the law and that ultimately we are going to prevail.''
As director of the Justice Department's Federal Programs Branch, Mr. Gershengorn oversees one of the most captivating dockets in American jurisprudence. It is his office's job to represent the government against constitutional challenges, and its caseload includes the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gay and bisexual members of the military, the rights of suspected terrorists held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and rules governing embryonic stem cell research.
''Every day,'' Mr. Gershengorn said, ''I deal with two or three cases of a lifetime.''
The Justice Department's top leadership handpicked Mr. Gershengorn to handle the health care cases in the lower courts, said Thomas J. Perrelli, an associate attorney general. Mr. Gershengorn has reviewed and approved the written briefs in every case, and has personally argued the administration's position in three courtrooms.
Shortly after Mr. Obama took office, Mr. Perrelli recruited Mr. Gershengorn to the Justice Department from the national litigation firm of Jenner & Block, where each worked in the Washington office. He took a substantial pay cut and now earns above $170,000 a year.
Mr. Gershengorn grew up outside Boston, where his father is a cardiologist and his mother a state court judge. Two sisters have also worked as Justice Department lawyers, as did Mr. Gershengorn's wife. The couple have three sons.
Mr. Gershengorn graduated from Harvard and Harvard Law, and clerked for both Judge Amalya L. Kearse on the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, and Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court. He then served as counsel to Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick in the Clinton administration.
Ms. Gorelick said she found Mr. Gershengorn to be honest, simultaneously soft-spoken and determined, and possessed of intelligence and humility beyond his years. ''He was a real star,'' she said, ''and it does not surprise me that he was picked for one of the toughest jobs for a lawyer in the Obama administration.''
Mr. Perrelli said Mr. Gershengorn excelled at Jenner & Block, where he specialized in both telecommunications law and Indian sovereignty disputes, mastering complex issues involving novel legal theories. That, Mr. Perrelli said, made him an ideal fit for the health care cases.
The attacks on the law have been various, but the central argument is that Congress exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution by passing a bill that will penalize Americans for not obtaining health insurance.
To do so, the plaintiffs argue, is to regulate inactivity, and if allowed would remove any reasonable limits on federal power.
Mr. Gershengorn responds that the insurance requirement falls within Supreme Court precedents allowing Congress to regulate ''activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.'' With each hearing, he has sought to perfect his argument that the act of not obtaining insurance is itself a consequential commercial decision.
''The appearance of inactivity is just an illusion,'' he told Judge Hudson in October. ''The consumption of medical services without paying for them, and then shifting those costs, has a devastating effect on the economy.''
Although he was not directly involved, Mr. Gershengorn was a clerk on the Supreme Court in 1995 when it ruled in United States v. Lopez, the first of two cases since the New Deal that have redefined the limits on Commerce Clause powers. He said he sensed then that ''we were at the beginning of a dialogue and not the end of it.''
In court, Mr. Gershengorn, who is 6-foot-2 and as lanky as Jimmy Stewart, bends slightly over the lectern as he braces for the judge's inevitable interruptions. He uses words like ''extraordinary'' and ''revolutionary'' to characterize the plaintiffs' claims, impressing upon judges that ''overturning an act of the democratically elected Congress is a major, major deal.''
Mr. Gershengorn favors an even-tempered approach, but his intensity can sometimes project him toward the edges of judicial deference.
When Judge Hudson, in questioning him during the October hearing, mischaracterized another judge's ruling, Mr. Gershengorn was perhaps too quick to pounce.
''No, no, your honor, that's not correct, absolutely not correct,'' he began, before catching himself. ''Excuse me, your honor. I didn't mean to offend.''
Judge Hudson seemed to brush it off. ''I stand corrected, then,'' he said.
Judge Hudson later complimented the lawyers on both sides, saying it had been one of the best-argued cases of his tenure.
Mr. Gershengorn is a Democrat and contributed to Mr. Obama's campaign, but does not consider himself particularly partisan. His only interaction with the president came during pickup basketball games in law school.
But Mr. Gershengorn does believe in the health care law, and is proud to defend it.
''I certainly know people who have illnesses and can't get insurance or are stuck at a job,'' he said. ''To have the chance to defend legislation that actually extends coverage to those people, I think is critically important. I'm honored to do that.''
Online Correction: December 9, 2010, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly at one point to a party in a lawsuit over the health law as the defendants in the suit.

HEADLINE: Wisconsin and Ohio Forfeit Federal Money for Rail Projects

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Ohio and Wisconsin's loss of $1.2 billion in federal stimulus money for rail projects will be California, Florida and 11 other states' gain.
Ohio and Wisconsin sought and won the stimulus money this year to build new rail lines to create jobs, ease traffic and help the environment. But both states elected new Republican governors last month who vowed to kill the train projects, arguing that they were boondoggles that would require annual state subsidies to operate. 
Now both states, which have been hit hard by the economic downturn, are losing the money. The federal Department of Transportation announced Thursday that it was rescinding the $810 million that had been awarded to Wisconsin to build a train line from Milwaukee to Madison, and the $385 million that was awarded to Ohio to build a train line linking Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland.
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said the money would be redistributed to 13 other states, with the biggest winners being California and Florida.
Neither of the newly elected governors expressed any regret at losing the money, or the construction jobs.
''Wisconsin taxpayers were victorious today in defeating this project,'' Scott Walker, the governor-elect of Wisconsin, said in a statement. ''The Madison-to-Milwaukee train line is dead.''
Mr. Walker had questioned who would pay to ride the train, noting that it would take roughly the same amount of time to make the trip as driving. And he worried that even though the federal government had agreed to pay to build the line, it would cost the state around $7.5 million a year to operate once it was open.
Exasperated train supporters complained that his position was analogous to turning down a free new car, simply because it would cost money for gas and insurance. But many voters supported him.
Both Mr. Walker and John Kasich, the governor-elect of Ohio, had sought permission to spend the money on highway construction or other infrastructure projects. But the money was part of $8 billion in the stimulus bill for train projects.
Mr. Kasich then asked for the money to be used to reduce the federal deficit if he could not use it for other projects. A spokesman for Mr. Kasich, Rob Nichols, said Thursday that ''He finds it tragic that instead of saving taxpayer money, they would simply waste it elsewhere.''
Neither state would have gotten true high-speed trains; their incoming governors said the proposed trains would have been too slow to attract many passengers. But most of their money is being redistributed to bullet-train projects.
California will receive $624 million of it, adding to the roughly $3 billion it has received so far toward the construction of a high-speed train from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Florida will get $342 million, adding to the roughly $2 billion it has received to build a high-speed train between Orlando and Tampa.
The rest will be divided among 11 other states for conventional train service, and Wisconsin will keep around $2 million for an existing train line.

HEADLINE: Senate Leaders Unveil Package of Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate leaders on Thursday evening formally unveiled the huge tax cut package worked out between the White House and Republicans and immediately began debating it, while House Democrats rebelled against President Obama and threatened to keep the measure from ever reaching the floor.
A procedural vote was scheduled in the Senate for Monday evening to overcome a filibuster by Democrats opposed to the plan. But in a first test on Thursday, the Senate voted 65 to 11 on a technical issue related to the bill, suggesting it would not be difficult to secure the 60 votes needed to defeat the filibuster. 
Despite the opposition in the House, Mr. Obama expressed confidence in an interview on National Public Radio that the package would be approved.
''Here's what I'm confident about,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That nobody, Democrat or Republican, wants to see people's paychecks smaller on Jan. 1 because Congress didn't act.''
While a detailed cost analysis was not immediately available, Senate aides said the package would cost $858 billion, with tax breaks accounting for $801 billion, making the proposal even more expensive than last year's economic stimulus.
The bill would extend all of the Bush-era tax cuts, even on high incomes; provide a generous tax exemption for wealthy estates; maintain lowered rates on capital gains and dividends; and prevent the alternative minimum tax from hitting up to 21 million more households, all for two years.
It would also keep jobless benefits flowing to the long-term unemployed for an additional 13 months and grant a one-year payroll tax cut for nearly all workers, and would extend other tax breaks for middle- and low-income workers and businesses aimed at revving up the still-struggling economy.
Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, and a fierce opponent of the plan, gave the first lengthy floor speech.
''What will the passage of this legislation mean for the future of our country?'' Mr. Sanders asked. ''If we pass this agreement as written, it says that we are going to the Bush policy of trickle-down economics for at least two more years. And to my mind, that is absurd because this is a policy, based on all of the evidence, that grotesquely failed.''
Democratic officials on Thursday also said they had secured some changes intended to widen support, adding a tax break for ethanol production and extending a grant program to promote alternative energy.
But with rank-and-file Democrats deeply unhappy about continuing the tax policies of President George W. Bush, senior party leaders said the energy items would not be enough to calm House Democrats who earlier on Thursday took an extraordinary internal vote rejecting the White House tax deal.
''We have taken a position that this is not an acceptable package,'' said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, the Oregon Democrat who urged the House Democratic Caucus to oppose the proposal. ''It's way too expensive to benefit a very few. We want something that is targeted to the people in need.''
The strongest opposition in the House was to the estate tax provision, which would set an exemption of $5 million per person and a top rate of 35 percent -- a higher exemption and lower rate than many Democrats want.
The estate tax lapsed entirely this year, but is set to return on Jan. 1 with an exemption of $1 million per estate and a maximum rate of 55 percent. House Democrats said the deal between the White House and Congressional Republicans would result in $68 billion in lost tax revenue compared with letting the tax reset to pre-2001 levels.
''The most egregious provision is the bonanza for the wealthiest estates in the country, '' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who represented House Democrats in the formal negotiations on the tax issue even as the White House was working directly with Republican leaders behind the scenes.
The caucus vote is not binding on the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. But after the vote she indicated she would not cross her rank-and-file. ''We will continue discussions with the president and our Democratic and Republican colleagues in the days ahead to improve the proposal before it comes to the House floor for a vote,'' she said.
House Democrats have little negotiating leverage. If they block the package, the White House could simply work with the incoming Republican majority to pass it in early January -- though Republicans would presumably be in a position to extract further concessions.
But House Democrats were said to be contemplating one strategy by which they would take the package after it was approved by the Senate and replace the estate tax language with a proposal they found more palatable -- an exemption of $3.5 million and maximum rate of 45 percent that were in place in 2009.
That would then test the willingness of Senate Republicans to vote down the plan simply to safeguard the better terms for wealthy estates.
The White House on Thursday continued an aggressive effort to sell the proposal to lawmakers and to the public, and continued to send out a barrage of e-mail announcing support among local and state officials, including Mayor Greg Goodnight of Kokomo, Ind., and Governor-elect Andrew M. Cuomo of New York.
The White House communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, and the deputy director of the National Economic Council held a conference call to describe the tax benefits for Americans in various economic circumstances. Mr. Pfeiffer said the deal reflected tough negotiations and concessions on all sides.
''There are parts of this deal that are very upsetting in our own party, including the extension of the upper-income tax cuts,'' he said. ''Those are things that the president also very much does not like. But that's the nature of compromises.''

HEADLINE: Dire Predictions And Muni Bonds

BYLINE: By AGNES CRANE and JEFFREY GOLDFARB

 BODY:
Armageddon makes for a sexy story. Volatility in the $2.8 trillion United States municipal bond market is real, but the scary tale being spun out of budget-busting states like California involves a lot of literary license.
The rockiness of the market lately is shown by the surge in the perceived riskiness of muni bonds. The highest-rated issuers' paper is trading at yields that are 0.5 to 0.8 percentage points higher than at the beginning of November. Meanwhile, investors in mutual funds that buy them withdrew $5.6 billion of their money in the five weeks to Dec. 1, the biggest withdrawal since the financial crisis.
The volatility seems to have been started by technical factors rather than rising worries about state and municipal defaults. Surging Treasury yields rattled this notoriously illiquid market; a flash flood of new supply didn't help; the future of the popular but temporary Build America Bond program is bound up in the Washington tax debate; and the related uncertainty over personal tax rates hardly fills investors in the tax-driven muni asset class with much confidence, either. 
Moreover, municipal securities have few natural buyers once any kind of exodus gets going. Their tax-exempt status makes them best suited for wealthy American investors who buy them to tuck away in portfolios. Retail investors hold more than two-thirds of outstanding muni debt, according to Federal Reserve data. That compares with Treasuries, where retail holders account for roughly 20 percent of the total.
That arguably leaves the municipal bond market especially vulnerable to perceptions. It's true that higher yields make it more expensive for small issuers like cities, sewage authorities or school districts to raise funds. That could make a municipal default more likely -- but only at the margin.
Meantime, the alarming-sounding deficits of some big states have attracted predictions of defaults from market seers. Yet while a state default isn't impossible, comparisons with, say, Greece or Italy are misleading. California's debt-to-gross state product ratio is just 5 percent -- minuscule compared with the Greek debt-to-G.D.P. level of 133 percent, as estimated by JPMorgan, or even the United States government's 88 percent.
The danger is that retail investors, in particular, read too much into the headlines and turn the perception of default risk into reality. The truth of the matter is they may be better off worrying about their ''risk-free'' holdings of Treasuries.
Banking on Bawdy
Bankers can only hope to be like Howard Stern. The radio host agreed to stay with the satellite broadcaster Sirius XM for another five years. Investors added more than $275 million to the company's value on the news. Traders and other financial deal makers like to think their presence has that kind of importance to their employers. After all, they often equate their pay to that of film and sports stars. Truth is, few of them matter nearly as much.
Competitive hiring of investment bankers contributes to the sometimes irrational market for their services. That mythology makes Mr. Stern's case all the more stark a comparison.
Sirius XM did face the possibility Mr. Stern would call it quits to lounge about with his younger wife, as the host frequently discussed on his show. Such talk led to some nervous moments for shareholders. But in reality, Mr. Stern's options were few. Returning to terrestrial radio or jumping to Apple's iTunes, as had been rumored, sounded implausible for the King of All Four-Letter Words.
Even without competitive tension, Mr. Stern's worth probably hasn't suffered much since Sirius first signed him in 2004, when the company paid him and his cohorts $500 million in cash and shares for five years -- though the terms of his new deal aren't disclosed. At the time, the fledgling satellite radio company had a mere $13 million of revenue and 600,000 subscribers. Since then, the company has merged with rival XM and swelled its subscriber base to 20 million. It should generate $3 billion of revenue in 2011.
Mr. Stern is responsible for about 10 percent of Sirius XM's subscribers, an analyst at Standard & Poor's reckons. However unlikely it is the company would have lost two million listeners had he defected, only a handful of bankers at best can realistically claim anything approaching such relevance -- and even at smaller firms, few if any can claim Mr. Stern's kind of impact on their employers' stock prices. The shock-jock's ego may be huge, but at least he's genuinely one of a kind.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Gains an Ally for a Looming Fight With the Public-Employee Unions

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Business and real estate executives intend to raise $10 million in the coming weeks in support of Governor-elect Andrew M. Cuomo's looming showdown with government employees' unions over wages and pensions.
And the business leaders, organizing as the Committee to Save New York, have found a surprising ally: one of the most powerful union officials in the state.
The official, Gary LaBarbera, is the president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, a 100,000-member federation of electricians, iron workers and operating engineers who work on large building sites around the region.
Their trades have suffered 20 percent unemployment in the economic downturn, and the union argues that healthier state finances and lower taxes will spur development and construction work. 
And while, on average, the construction workers earn more than their union brethren in the public sector, they have the rankling perception that government unions have not shared in their recent suffering.
''We're advocating for a fiscally sane economy in New York,'' Mr. LaBarbera said Thursday. ''This is not about bashing public-sector unions. But without a fiscally sound environment, we will not be able to attract new businesses to the city; we'll continue to lose business.''
He conceded that ''at times there will be competing interests between public- and private-sector unions.'' But he added that he had become involved in the committee, in part, to serve as a counterweight to those who would ''vilify working people.''
His participation was heatedly discussed during a recent meeting in Puerto Rico of the Public Employees Conference, a coalition of government employee unions in the state. And labor leaders say the top union official in the state, Denis M. Hughes, the president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O., is concerned about what could turn out to be a debilitating schism in the most unionized state in the country.
Joshua B. Freeman, a labor historian at the City University of New York and the author of ''Working-Class New York,'' said he was not surprised that there might be ''an open break'' within the labor movement.
''The construction trades have been hard hit by the economy,'' Professor Freeman said, ''and are hard pressed to provide leadership for a labor movement that is increasingly dominated by public-sector unions.''
Though there has long been friction between private- and public-sector unions, the construction trades have had reason to feel aggrieved with other unions as well. Last year, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union successfully defeated the $310 million Kingsbridge Armory project in the Bronx, which would have meant hundreds of jobs for construction workers, when the developer failed to agree to certain wage demands for employees who would work at the resulting retail mall.
But unions representing public workers have come under increasing pressure around the country. The Republican governor-elect in Wisconsin, for instance, has suggested that public employees should perhaps be stripped of collective-bargaining rights.
Still, Mr. Freeman said he would be ''amazed'' to see any unions join the business coalition if Mr. Cuomo turned his fiscal campaign into an open attack on unions.
Officially, Mr. Cuomo has no connection to the committee, but his ties are evident, and he has been fully apprised of the group's progress, executives said.
The committee's work will be run by Bill Cunningham, a managing director of DKC, a public relations firm started by Dan Klores, a close friend of Mr. Cuomo's. John Marino, a former state Democratic Party chairman who is close to Mr. Cuomo, also works at DKC and has been active in the effort, committee members said.
The addition of Mr. LaBarbera -- whom Mr. Cuomo named to his transition committee on transportation and infrastructure -- may provide the Committee to Save New York with some insulation from criticism that the elite is looking to solve the fiscal problems of the state on the backs of working people.
Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the business association Partnership for New York City, has been a key player in the formation of the committee. She said it was not trying to turn government workers into ''villains.''
''This is just a situation where we have not been realistic over the past decade about what New York could afford to spend and still remain a competitive and attractive place to live and do business,'' Ms. Wylde said.
Mr. Cuomo has made it clear that he plans to hold the line on property taxes, restructure Medicaid spending and take on the unions in a bid to resolve the state's $9 billion budget deficit.
And he has publicly asked business leaders to back him up.
One influential leader, Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said, ''I believe the business community needs to stand up and support a fiscally responsible budget.''
The committee, which includes the Real Estate Board and the Business Council of New York, has been asking executives and companies to pledge money, to finance a campaign of advertising and advocacy to counter the kind of advertising campaign that unions have used effectively to blunt previous cost-cutting attempts by governors.
One union, the Public Employees Federation, is already distributing stickers opposing layoffs and urging, ''Keep Vital Services.'' These are aimed at Gov. David A. Paterson, who has been threatening cuts in his final weeks in office.
Regardless of the involvement of the construction unions, Ed Ott, the former executive director of the New York City Central Labor Council, said the group's demand for government employees to sacrifice was ''too much of a one-way street.''
''It's all about what should working people give up,'' said Mr. Ott, now a lecturer on labor matters for CUNY.
''Let's put the stock transfer tax on the table,'' he added, referring to proposals to revive a state tax on stock sales, which Wall Street vehemently opposes.
Rob Speyer, co-chief executive of Tishman Speyer Properties, is expected to be named a co-chairman of the new committee, along with Richard D. Parsons, the chairman of Citigroup, and H. Carl McCall, a banking veteran and a former state comptroller.
The committee is soliciting pledges of financing. Tishman Speyer has said it will donate $1 million.
In recent years, efforts to curb state spending have been blunted by advertising campaigns by unions, notably 1199/S.E.I.U., the health care union.
Mr. Cuomo is intent on overhauling the Medicaid program, where state spending has tripled over the past 10 years while enrollment has more than doubled. Instead of slugging it out with 1199, however, Mr. Cuomo has quietly entered talks with George Gresham, president of the union. Mr. Gresham had early and loudly endorsed Mr. Cuomo's bid for governor, when many other unions sat out the race.

HEADLINE: The Little-Known Decision-Makers for Medicare Physicans Fees

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: It's time for the government to turn to a broad group of independent experts to set the fees that physicians receive from Medicare, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Have you ever heard of the RUC?
If not, you are not part of the small circle of cognoscenti who know what makes the world go 'round - at least in Medicare. To enter the circle, read on.
In my post last week, I described how Medicare pays physicians for the services they render Medicare beneficiaries. In a nutshell, for a particular service (e.g., a routine office revisit or an appendectomy or a heart transplant) that we shall call Z, Medicare pays a fee calculated with this formula:
FeeZ = (Work RVUZ x Work GPCI + PE RVUZ x PE GPCI + PLI RVUZ x PLI GPCI) x CV
FeeZ is the dollar amount of the fee paid for the service, Work RVUZ denotes the relative value units for the physicians' work going into the production of service Z, PEZ denotes the relative value units of the physician's practice expenses allocated to service Z and PLIZ denotes the relative value units for the professional liability insurance premium allocated to service Z.
Each of these three relative cost factors is adjusted for its own geographic price index, GPCI in the equation. Thus, there is one GPCI for the physician's work, one for practice expenses and a one for malpractice premiums.
The sum of these three RVU components, adjusted by their GPCIs, is multiplied by CV, the conversion factor. This is the dollar amount that Medicare pays for one overall RVU.
This conversion factor is updated annually in a vaguely amusing ritual of which I shall write in the future. It currently stands at $36.0846. (For a history of these conversion factors, click here.)
The fee for service Z might be further adjusted by multipliers that reward physicians for working in an area with a shortage of physicians and other factors. (For more detail, click here.)
In response to my previous post, some commentators asked for a numerical illustration -- so here it goes.
In "What Every Physician Should Know About the RUC," the American Academy of Family Physicians provides this example for a service defined as "level III established patient office visit," Code 99213:
Work RVUs: 0.92, Practice Expense RVU 0.72, Malpractice RVU 0.03. Assuming for simplicity that all geographic price indices - the GPCIs - are 1 for this hypothetical physician's location, the total RVUs for this service are 1.56. It would be slightly different if the GPCIs were not all equal to 1.
The RVUs in this illustration are for 2008. If they have not changed since that time, and at today's conversion factor of $36.0846, the physician would be paid a fee of $36.0846 x 1.56 = $56.29 for that service (Code 99213).
By contrast, the total RVUs for a "left heart catheterization" (code 93510) are 40.54, of which 33.61 are related to practice expenses. The fee for that procedure at today's conversion factor would be $1,462.87.
In this example from the American Academy of Family Physicians, the Work RVU for a "level III-established patient office visit" (Code 99213) in 2008 was not 0.92, but only 0.8806, because the 0.92 had been adjusted for "budget neutrality reasons." What is that?
Here is where the mysterious RUC (pronounced RUCK) comes in.
Think about the RVUs underlying the Medicare fee schedule. They are thought to reflect total relative practice costs, including the physician's own time, for each of the 7,000 distinct physician services in the schedule. These underlying relative cost estimates were developed from carefully described medical-case vignettes submitted to groups of physicians who were then asked to tell the surveyors how much "physician work" each vignette entailed relative to some base vignette (e.g., a routine office revisit). This established the physician-work RVUs.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, known within the health-care sector as the C.M.S., an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that administers Medicare, then adds physician expense and malpractice RVUs to these Work RVUs to arrive at the total RVUs for a service.
Even if we assume that at some point the 7,000 or so RVUs in Medicare's relative value scale accurately reflected the true total relative practice costs, it must be the case that these RVUs change over time, because of rapid advances in medical technology.
Operations that may have taken two hours and required hospitalization in 1995, for example, may now be performed by physicians in half the time and in an ambulatory-care setting. Furthermore, entirely new services have come on line that did not exist when the fee schedule was established.
Who makes the required adjustments in the RVUs?
De jure it is the C.M.S.
De facto, it is the American Medical Association's Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee, otherwise known as -- you guessed it -- the RUC.
The RUC is a group of 29 physicians drawn from a variety of medical specialties. It was established by the A.M.A. in 1991 to advise the C.M.S. on recalibrations of the relative value scale underlying the Medicare fee schedule.
In 1991, as a commissioner on the Physician Payment Review Commission of Congress, I thought the RUC was a useful institution. I continue to believe so.
There is, in my view, great merit in government's solicitation of the views of the profession whose economic affairs are being partially determined by the Medicare fee schedule. We should be thankful for the dedicated physicians who devote so much of their time to serving on the RUC Indeed, the C.M.S. recently wrote to the RUC, acknowledging its debt to these physicians.
As it happens, however, the C.M.S. tends to accept the RUC's recommendations on RVU changes more than 90 percent of the time, which effectively makes the RUC the final arbiter in these matters. I do not believe that slavish acceptance of the RUC's recommendations is a good thing, if only because the physicians on the RUC do labor under at least the appearance of a conflict of interest.
Medicare requires changes in the RVUs to be budget neutral overall, effectively forcing a zero-sum game on the RUC. This means that when the RUC recommends raising the RVU for some services, the RVUs of other services must be decreased. That adjustment has led to the "budget neutrality adjustment" in the American Academy of Family Physicians' numerical example shown above.
Primary physicians have long complained that they are outgunned by specialists on the RUC in this zero-sum game. They assert that the RUC has thus contributed to the relatively low pay of primary care physicians and to the shortage of primary care now being lamented all over the country.
To illustrate that these primary care physicians have a good case, consider a fascinating recent study of physician incomes produced for Medpac, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission of Congress. Shown below is one chart from that study. The figures shown in this display are net income after practice expenses but before income taxes.
Surely there is something absurd when a nation pays a primary care physician poorly relative to other specialists and then wrings its hands over a shortage of primary care physicians. Is it so hard to understand why young physicians, emerging as they do from long and arduous training, exhausted and deeply in debt, let expected future financial reward be a major factor in choosing their specialty?
In a highly critical article, The Wall Street Journal recently described the modus operandi of the RUC, as did the Center for Public Integrity. These are well worth reading, as is the American Medical Association's brisk response to the criticism (and again here).
So what are we to make of it all?
I would prefer that the C.M.S. declare "Independence Day" when it comes to recalibrating the RVUs.
To be sure, the C.M.S. should continue to seek input from the RUC. But I concur wholeheartedly with the Medpac's recent recommendation that a truly independent body of experts (including economists and third-party payers) render a second opinion on RUC recommendations.
Specifically, this independent body should focus on frequently billed codes that, in the light of current medical technology, may be relatively overpriced in Medicare's relative value scale. The C.M.S. has already asked the RUC to do this. That task should be delegated instead to the truly independent body.
All of which requires, of course, that Congress properly fund the C.M.S. administrative budget for all that agency is asked to do.

HEADLINE: Retail Gasoline Prices Climb to a 2-Year High

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Gasoline prices have hit a two-year high heading into the Christmas holiday, producing a strain for shoppers trying to stretch their dollars.
Retail gas prices have been rising briskly over the last month, tracking crude oil prices, which rose on surging imports by China and a weakening of the dollar.
The average national price of gas rose over the last week to $2.98 a gallon, up from $2.90, according to AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report. Although specialists say prices have probably peaked for the month, the price at the pump is now 35 cents a gallon higher than a year ago. 
The Oil Price Information Service has estimated that consumers will pay $34 billion this month for gasoline, up from about $27.6 billion in December 2009 -- money that might have been spent on holiday shopping.
Michael P. Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers, said that retailers did not yet appear to have been significantly hurt by higher gasoline prices. ''It doesn't seem to matter that much because we are getting accelerating economic activity, which is an offset,'' he said.
Mr. Niemira also noted that the top 20 percent of households with the most income accounted for nearly 40 percent of retail spending, and that group had benefited from a rising stock market over the last year.
But Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, said that rising gasoline prices could have a psychological impact, since consumers see them posted everywhere.
A 10 percent rise in crude oil prices in the last three weeks, to as much as $90, has been particularly onerous to a few regions of the country, such as parts of Long Island and New England, that still depend on heating oil. On Friday, oil prices fell by 58 cents, ending the day at $87.79.
Larry Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, an organization partly financed by the oil industry, said the rising prices would begin slowing the economic recovery by early next year.
''When the bills come in after the Christmas shopping, there will be less disposable income in people's pockets because of the increase in expenditures for oil, which they can't avoid,'' he said. He predicted that the oil price increases would shave at least a quarter of a percentage point from the gross domestic product next year.
Mr. Goldstein said the slower growth would be an ''unintended negative consequence'' of the Federal Reserve's recent quantitative easing, which resulted in a lowering in the value of the dollar and encouraged investors to put money into hard assets like oil. Because oil is priced in dollars, global traders tend to bid up its price as the dollar falls in value against other currencies.
Energy analysts said that oil and gasoline prices were probably close to their wintertime peak because Americans typically drive less in January and prices tend to fall. But when the weather warms up, they predict another surge.
''We will have a spring rally that will take us to between $3.10 and $3.50'' a gallon for gasoline at the pump, Mr. Kloza predicted.
Oil-producing nations and consuming nations like the United States have been fairly satisfied with oil prices the last few years because they have remained high enough to encourage investments but substantially lower than three summers ago, when crude reached $147 a barrel and Americans paid $4 a gallon.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meets in Quito, Ecuador, on Saturday, is not expected to change crude production quotas that were set two years ago. Saudi Arabian oil officials, who are the most powerful in the organization, say they are satisfied with an oil price of $70 to $90 a barrel.
The recent rise in oil and gasoline prices partly reflects the modest economic recovery.
The Energy Department has estimated that oil demand in 2010 rose 1.7 percent, or 320,000 barrels a day, from last year. The department expects that demand will increase an additional 0.9 percent, or 170,000 barrels a day, in 2011. The nation now consumes 19.1 million barrels a day.
''The resilience of U.S. gasoline demand has been a surprise in recent months,'' according to a report released Friday by the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based organization that advises the industrialized countries.
Most energy experts say that oil and gasoline prices will continue to rise, although it could take years before they approach the 2008 highs.
In Friday's report, the energy agency raised its global forecast for crude oil demand for 2011, but it still projects only a modest increase of 1.4 million barrels a day from 2010 levels, to 88.8 million barrels a day. That compares to an increase of 2.4 million barrels a day in 2010 over 2009.

HEADLINE: Nassau Caught In Fiscal Crisis Despite Wealth

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
MINEOLA, N.Y. -- Facing a huge budget deficit when he took office in January, Nassau County Executive Edward P. Mangano did not impose a hiring freeze. He did not stop borrowing to subsidize some of the richest school districts in the country. He did not eliminate the Police Department's beloved mounted unit.
Instead, Mr. Mangano, a Republican who won one of the first upsets of the Tea Party era, did what he had promised: He cut taxes, adding $40 million to the county's deficit, which has since reached nearly $350 million.
Now, with its bonds suddenly downgraded and a state oversight agency preparing to seize its checkbook and credit cards, Nassau is on the verge of a full-fledged fiscal crisis. 
That things could get so dire in this wealthy county, where property taxes are the second highest in the nation, offers a lesson in what happens when anti-tax fervor meets the realities of disappearing revenues and a punch-drunk economy. At heart, though, the situation -- like state budget crises in New York, New Jersey and Illinois -- illuminates the troubles long-prosperous governments, with established interest groups and residents accustomed to high levels of services, face in adapting to protracted lean times.
''It's the crisis of affluence,'' said E. J. McMahon, director of the Manhattan Institute's Empire Center for New York Policy. ''It's not just a problematic old inner city that can't get out of its old way of doing things,'' he said. ''What makes Nassau a microcosm of New York State is its high spending, high taxes, intransigent unions, a pronounced taste for debt, and a sense that too many people in both parties have a stake in keeping it all that way.''
Like Nassau, other localities across New York and elsewhere have suffered credit downgrades, as prolonged economic weakness has revealed deep structural problems, including unsustainable fiscal practices and looming pension obligations.
Here, though, many thought the bad habits had been corrected. Nassau's last fiscal meltdown came in 1999, after years of unchecked spending growth paid for with mounting debt and one-time revenues like sales of county land.
It led to a $200 million deficit and a credit rating just above junk. It triggered a Democratic takeover of what had long been a Republican bastion. And it ended with a $100 million state bailout in 2000 and the creation of a watchdog agency, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, to oversee the county's fiscal practices.
Under pressure from that authority, Mr. Mangano's Democratic predecessor, Thomas R. Suozzi, raised property taxes, shrank the county work force and reduced the county's reliance on borrowing to pay for operating costs.
But as the economy faltered in 2007, Mr. Suozzi, eyeing statewide office, began relying heavily on one-shot revenue generators.
He won short-term concessions from unions, like deferred salary increases, by extending a no-layoff guarantee through 2011. He resorted to borrowing to pay one of the county's always onerous bills: the refunds given to residents who appeal their property tax assessments. And last year, up for re-election, he sidestepped a property tax increase by imposing a 2.5 percent tax on home heating bills.
That handed Mr. Mangano a campaign issue, which he rode into office. If he had any mandate, it was to scrap the heating bill tax and, as he put it, restore confidence in county government.
As things turned out, though, ''Those two promises turned out to be at odds,'' said Lawrence Levy, an expert on suburban politics at Hofstra University.
Mr. Mangano got rid of the energy tax. But he never came up with offsetting spending cuts. That sets him apart from Republicans elected in New Jersey and in Westchester County last year, who have warred with unions and made painful cuts in services.
Indeed, while Mr. Mangano was a beneficiary of an anti-incumbent taxpayer revolt, he was something of an insider, with 14 years in the county legislature and friendly relations with union leaders.
When he offered an early retirement incentive plan that took more than 100 police officers and 400 others off the payroll, he drew criticism for allowing highly paid employees to take advantage of the buyouts; some walked away with as much as $600,000.
Mr. Mangano defended his approach, saying that he cut the work force to levels not seen since the 1950s, and bargained aggressively for more-flexible work rules.
''Everybody wants to gloss over the fact that real savings have occurred in this administration,'' he said in an interview. ''Undisputable ones.''
And, he boasted, he accomplished them without cutting services -- though the county is now threatening to cut off social-service agencies.
He also complained that his deep cuts in political appointments went unnoticed. But patronage, a fact of life since Nassau was carved out of Queens in 1899, has not been eradicated: after Mr. Mangano shrank the county attorney's office, it awarded a $250,000 contract to the law firm that employs Joseph N. Mondello, the Nassau Republican leader. And he appointed former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's daughter as his commissioner of aging.
Mr. Mangano did win praise from fiscal experts for tackling costly age-old inequities in how Nassau subsidizes local services like schools and sewers. One change will make school districts and towns pay their share of the refunds of property taxes for the first time since 1948.
School boards howled. So, too, did nonprofit groups and colleges like Hofstra, when Mr. Mangano insisted they begin paying for sewer service -- something taxpayers had previously provided them free.
Nassau is not alone in seeking to pass on costs for services to localities; states have imposed similar measures. Yet these changes will take years to deliver true savings.
For the fiscal year that begins Jan. 1, Mr. Mangano's budget appears to include as many prayers as plans. He penciled in $60 million in givebacks from labor -- surprising unions, who have contracts that run through 2015. Pressed on that point, Mr. Mangano said he would ''order'' union concessions, ignoring the idea's dubious constitutionality and drawing biting mockery.
The budget also called for borrowing an additional $100 million to pay tax refunds, and counted on more than $20 million in new help from the state.
Officials at the Nassau Interim Finance Authority questioned the seriousness of the plan.
''Mineola, we have a problem,'' Ronald A. Stack, the authority's chairman, said at a public board meeting in late September, as Mr. Mangano sat in the front row, listening.
Mr. Stack has brought in former Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye to advise the authority on whether to seize control of the county's finances, and if so, how. The law creating the authority says it ''shall'' take over if Nassau's shortfall exceeds 1 percent of its budget -- or about $26 million.
Mr. Mangano is pleading for more time, publicly saying he was personally negotiating with the unions for significant savings. Privately, he has been lobbying state lawmakers to let him raise the county's sales tax by a quarter of a percent, which would generate about $60 million. Getting the sales tax increase, union leaders said in interviews, was a precondition for them to make concessions.
Moody's, the bond-rating agency, is not waiting. On Nov. 4, it downgraded the county's debt, citing $158 million in risks and weakening liquidity, and warning that even Mr. Mangano's contingency plans required contingency plans.
This week, the situation grew more dire. Before heading to Disney World on Wednesday for a three-day golf outing and a fund-raiser, Mr. Mangano went to Albany, where he discovered what others said had been obvious: There would be no state assistance for Nassau now.
Mr. Mangano made the best of the setback, saying he would resume his quest for a sales tax and labor concession rescue package in the new year.
''January's only a couple weeks away,'' he said.
That is true. But the Nassau Interim Finance Authority is moving on its own, and has called its next meeting for Dec. 21.

HEADLINE: America's Most Vulnerable

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
As we begin inevitably wrangling over budget cuts and other austerity measures, we must not lose sight of the plight of the most vulnerable among us -- the ones who have little say and few choices: the nation's poorest children. 
The gap between those children and the rest of our children is already unacceptably wide, and it can't afford to get wider. In fact, a report entitled ''The Children Left Behind,'' released by Unicef last Friday, examined inequality in well-being on a wide range of measures among children in 24 of the world's richest countries. America's rankings were among the worst.
Parents play a large role in this inequality, but so do policies. As the report wisely asks, ''Is there a point beyond which falling behind is not inevitable but policy susceptible, not unavoidable but unacceptable, not inequality but inequity?''
I say absolutely.
I would hope that we could move to improve this situation. But at the very least, we mustn't make it worse.

HEADLINE: Secret Cable Discusses Pfizer's Actions in Nigeria Case

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON; Andrew W. Lehren contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Pfizer was accused of hiring investigators ''to uncover corruption links'' to Nigeria's former attorney general and apply pressure to drop lawsuits against the company over a controversial 1996 test of antibiotics on children with meningitis, according to a secret State Department cable that related a company official's account.
Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, denied the cable's allegation, which was contained in documents released by WikiLeaks. The cable indicated that the information alleging corruption on the part of the attorney general was spread through the media to publicly pressure him to drop the lawsuits. 
''Any notion that the company hired investigators in connection to the former attorney general is simply preposterous,'' Christopher Loder, a spokesman at Pfizer's New York headquarters, said on Friday.
The former attorney general, Michael K. Aondoakaa, told The Associated Press that he knew nothing of any Pfizer attempt to investigate him. ''If they were doing it behind my back, it's very unfortunate,'' he was quoted as saying.
Last fall, Mr. Aondoakaa dismissed a $6 billion lawsuit and criminal charges as part of a settlement agreement with Pfizer, after allegations that the drug maker's experiment with antibiotics resulted in the deaths of Nigerian children. Pfizer contested the cause of the children's deaths, but ultimately settled with the country for an undisclosed amount in one case, according to a Pfizer filing in November. Mr. Loder said the money was to pay Nigeria's lawyers in the case.
Last year, the Nigerian state of Kano, where the experiments occurred, accepted a $75 million settlement to drop criminal charges and a civil suit seeking more than $2 billion. Mr. Aondoakaa was not involved in the Kano settlement.
In the cable, dated April 20, 2009, United States officials described an April 9 meeting in Lagos with Enrico Liggeri, Pfizer's company manager in Nigeria.
''According to Liggeri,'' the cable says, ''Pfizer had hired investigators to uncover corruption links to federal attorney general Michael Aondoakaa to expose him and put pressure on him to drop the federal cases. He said Pfizer's investigators were passing this information to local media.''
The cable continued: ''A series of damaging articles detailing Aondoakaa's 'alleged' corruption ties were published in February and March. Liggeri contended that Pfizer had much more damaging information on Aondoakaa and that Aondoakaa's cronies were pressuring him to drop the suit for fear of further negative articles.''
In seeking comment, Pfizer would say only that Mr. Liggeri was still employed as a manager in Nigeria, but it would not say whether the company had talked with him since the cable became public. Mr. Aondoakaa was not charged with any offenses.
Another part of the cable covers discussions a week earlier with Mr. Liggeri and two Pfizer lawyers about the state settlement, which had been tentatively reached even as federal negotiations continued. That part of the cable appears to accurately reflect the details of the state settlement announced in July 2009. It included $35 million for the families, $30 million for state health care programs and $10 million in legal fees.
Pfizer was sued in Nigeria after reports that it had tested an experimental antibiotic called Trovan on 100 children during a 1996 meningitis epidemic. Another 100 children were given an approved antibiotic, ceftriaxone. Families later charged they had not been properly informed and that the standard antibiotic dose was too low. Some children died and others suffered brain damage, paralysis, deafness or blindness during the trial, first disclosed by The Washington Post.
Pfizer said its researchers acted ethically. The company said deaths and injuries were caused by the meningitis, an inflammation of membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.
Trovan was approved in Europe and the United States for adults in 1997 but banned in Europe and restricted in the United States in 1999 after reports of liver failure and deaths.
In the leaked cable, the embassy describes Mr. Liggeri and two Pfizer lawyers briefing the ambassador and an economics deputy about the state settlement. In a meeting, ''EconDep,'' who was not otherwise identified, met with Mr. Liggeri. In addition to referring to Mr. Aondoakaa, the cable says Mr. Liggeri complained the lawsuits were ''wholly political in nature.''.
Mr. Liggeri, contacted by e-mail early Saturday morning in Nigeria, declined to comment on the cable and referred questions to a spokesman at Pfizer headquarters.
The cable was first published Friday by the British newspaper The Guardian and the Spanish newspaper El Pais.
Correction: December 16, 2010, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about allegations in a State Department cable released by WikiLeaks over Pfizer's tactics in fighting lawsuits stemming from drug trials on Nigerian children overstated what is known about how Pfizer ultimately handled the dispute. While Pfizer did reach a financial settlement with Nigeria, the amount was not disclosed. It is not the case that the company paid $75 million. (An earlier settlement with the Nigerian state of Kano, where the trials occurred, was $75 million.)

HEADLINE: $19 BILLION SUIT ACCUSES BANKER IN MADOFF CASE

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES and PETER LATTMAN; Nelson D. Schwartz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
9:13 p.m. Updated A prominent Austrian banker who portrayed herself for two years as one of Bernard L. Madoff's biggest victims was accused on Friday of conspiring for 23 years to funnel more than $9 billion into his immense global Ponzi scheme.
The accusations were made in a civil lawsuit that sought damages of $19.6 billion - the sum of the cash lost in a fraud that wiped out nearly $65 billion in paper wealth and ruined thousands of investors on almost every rung of the economic ladder.
The central defendant in the complaint is Sonja Kohn, who was the hub of a complex network of European and Caribbean funds that channeled money to Mr. Madoff. A well-connected banker in her native Vienna, Ms. Kohn insisted she never suspected her trusted friend was running a global Ponzi scheme.
In reality, according to the complaint, she knowingly raised billions of dollars in cash to sustain Mr. Madoff's fraud in exchange for at least $62 million in secret kickbacks - payments she insisted be handed over face to face and never put in the mail. The lawsuit says that her collusion was so pivotal to the fraud that Mr. Madoff tried to destroy evidence of their connection before his arrest in 2008. 
The civil complaint against Ms. Kohn was part of a fusillade of litigation filed in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan during the last month by Irving H. Picard, the trustee trying to recover assets for victims who sustained cash losses in the fraud.
The trustee has until midnight Saturday - the second anniversary of Mr. Madoff's arrest - to file any lawsuits seeking to recover cash withdrawn from the Ponzi scheme before its collapse.
Mr. Picard has recently sued more than a dozen major banks, including UBS and HSBC, which served several hedge funds that invested with Mr. Madoff; Citibank and Nomura, among seven banks that sold derivatives linked to Madoff feeder funds; and JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Madoff's primary banker during the years of his fraud. The banks have denied any responsibility for the fraud.
Other near-deadline lawsuits were filed against the founders and corporate parents of the Tremont Group, a primary Madoff conduit for pension funds and individual investors, and individuals associated with Mr. Madoff's London affiliate, including members of Mr. Madoff's family.
On Monday, Mr. Picard filed a sealed complaint against business entities connected to Fred Wilpon, the owner of the New York Mets baseball team, but confirmed that settlement negotiations were under way in the case. In a statement, Sterling Equities said that the baseball team would have all the resources it needed to ''fully compete and win'' regardless of the outcome of the talks. .
Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against other investors who withdrew fictional profits from their Madoff accounts over the years, but Mr. Picard said on Friday that he intended to dismiss any complaints filed against investors who could qualify for a ''hardship'' exemption based on their financial circumstances.
All told, Mr. Picard has filed lawsuits seeking to recover more than $50 billion in cash - much more than the approximately $2 billion he has so far recovered. Many of these cases will be hard-fought courtroom battles that could last for years, but some defendants are known to be negotiating possible settlements.
While it is difficult to estimate how much of that $50 billion Mr. Picard may ultimately recover, even a final recovery of just $10 billion - which people familiar with the settlement talks say seems feasible - would provide 50 cents on the dollar to those with cash losses. That is considerably more than seemed possible in the weeks and months immediately after Mr. Madoff's arrest.
That will be little comfort for the thousands of investors who are not eligible for compensation because they withdrew more from their Madoff accounts than they had invested. Similarly, thousands of investors whose money was channeled to Mr. Madoff through feeder funds are still uncertain about their status in the bankruptcy case. That issue is one of many knotty questions that remain to be resolved in court.
But even in a crowded court docket, the civil complaint filed Friday against Ms. Kohn stands out - both for the size of its claim for damages and for its stark accusations of criminal behavior.
''In Sonja Kohn, Madoff found a criminal soul mate, whose greed and dishonest inventiveness equaled his own,'' said Mr. Picard, the trustee.
The complaint did not disclose where Ms. Kohn was currently residing, and her lawyers in Vienna did not respond to several requests for comment on Friday. But in previous statements, Ms. Kohn has denied all accusations that she was complicit in Mr. Madoff's fraud.
Both Bank Austria and its current owner, UniCredit, Italy's largest bank, are named as defendants in this lawsuit - which cites their ties to Ms. Kohn - and in the earlier complaint filed against HSBC, the global bank based in London.
UniCredit said in a statement on Friday that its policy was not to comment on litigation but that it intended to vigorously defend itself against the accusations made against it and its Bank Austria unit. The 157-page complaint claimed that about half the Ponzi scheme's stolen funds - $9.1 billion out of an estimated $19.6 billion - was directly attributable to Ms. Kohn, her family members and their elaborate portfolio of feeder funds.
The amount makes ''these actors arguably the single most critical building block - the 'sine qua non' - of the Ponzi scheme,'' said Timothy S. Pfeifer, a partner at Baker & Hostetler, the trustee's law firm.
The lawsuit is the first brought by Mr. Picard to include accusations that defendants violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal law originally enacted to combat organized crime. Better known as RICO, the statute is a powerful tool that provides a means for corralling far-flung but interconnected entities into a single lawsuit. It also permits the recovery of triple damages.
When the fraud was first uncovered, Ms. Kohn seemed to personify a certain elegant breed of the desolate species known as ''Madoff victims.''
A self-made woman, she was a well-connected banker in Vienna and a tireless navigator of the quiet oceans of wealth flowing through European society. With a bouffant red wig and a combative personality - and armed with fluency in four languages and a gilded Rolodex of socialites, industrialists and financiers - she stood out in the conservative world of European private banking.
''She characterized herself as 'Austria's woman on Wall Street' and the gateway to Madoff,'' the complaint said.
Ms. Kohn first met Mr. Madoff in 1985 when she was living in Monsey, N.Y., and working as a stock broker at Merrill Lynch. She was introduced to him through an executive at Cohmad Securities, a Madoff-related brokerage firm that has also been sued by Mr. Picard.
In 1993, Ms. Kohn left New York and returned to Austria to tap the rich vein of European wealth for Mr. Madoff.
The lawsuit asserts that Ms. Kohn knew from the beginning that Mr. Madoff was a fraud, and that she received secret kickbacks from him in exchange for feeding him cash from other investors. It contends that she had a secret agreement with Mr. Madoff in which he paid her a flat fee - usually more than $6.5 million annually - to solicit investors for him.
''No Ponzi scheme can survive without a constant influx of fresh capital'' and Ms. Kohn's enterprise ''provided a flood of cash for Madoff,'' the trustee asserted in the complaint.
In 1994, Ms. Kohn formed Bank Medici, an Austrian bank that the trustee contends was nothing more than a conduit set up for the sole purpose of funneling money to Mr. Madoff through several feeder funds, including Harley International, the Herald Fund and the Primeo Funds.
Bank Medici was 25 percent owned by Bank Austria, and the trustee claims in his complaint that it was effectively a ''de facto'' branch of the country's largest bank. The association with Bank Austria gave Ms. Kohn and Bank Medici an imprimatur of legitimacy when recruiting investors, the trustee asserted.
The complaint also claims that Mr. Madoff kept secret records of his dealings with Ms. Kohn, hiding them from other people at his firm and destroying them before his confession and arrest. Some former employees kept copies of the records, which listed the specific accounts that Mr. Madoff attributed to Ms. Kohn, it said.
According to the trustee, Ms. Kohn took great pains to distance herself and her family from the Ponzi scheme. Neither she nor her relatives ever established a direct account with Mr. Madoff, the complaint said.
As the Ponzi scheme neared collapse in the fall of 2008, the feeder funds controlled by Ms. Kohn began making large withdrawals from Mr. Madoff, the trustee said, including a single $423 million transfer just one month before federal agents arrested Mr. Madoff.
In the months before the fraud's collapse, Ms. Kohn and her husband planned to move to Switzerland with stolen proceeds, the complaint said.
For some years, Ms. Kohn had spent a considerable amount of time in Switzerland, a common hunting ground for private bankers. But she was also able to penetrate successfully another close-knit milieu there, newly rich Russian oligarchs. After she went into hiding following Mr. Madoff's fall, other bankers suggested it was because she feared retribution by her Russian clients.
The trustee's complaint asserts that Ms. Kohn has not traveled to New York since Mr. Madoff's arrest. Several members of her family, including her husband, her mother, a son, a daughter and two sons-in-law were also named as defendants in the lawsuit. According to the complaint, several of them invoked their Fifth Amendment rights more than 100 times during depositions with the trustee's lawyers last year.

HEADLINE: Ponzi Schemes Aplenty, And How to Avoid Them

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
PONZI schemes are in the news again. The Justice Department announced this week that it had brought criminal and civil cases against more than 500 people for fraud schemes that involved more than $10 billion in losses. At the same time, there has been a flurry of lawsuits from Irving H. Picard, the bankruptcy trustee in the Bernard L. Madoff case. Mr. Picard is hitting a deadline for filing lawsuits seeking to recover money for people swindled in Mr. Madoff's Ponzi scheme, which came crashing down two years ago today.
But the reality is that small-time Ponzi schemes have been coming to light with regularity since the financial crisis began and investors started asking for their money back. That's a big problem when an investment scheme is built on paying out old investors with money brought in from new ones. According to data compiled by Investment News, a trade publication, schemes involving $9.244 billion in losses have been revealed so far this year.
Just this week, a former Denver-area hedge fund manager, Sean Mueller, was convicted of running a scheme that bilked some 65 investors out of $71 million. One of those investors, John Elway, the former Denver Broncos quarterback, reportedly lost $15 million. 
Mr. Elway, presumably, has other money to live on. But small investors who handed over their life savings to Mr. Mueller or other swindlers, will, in all likelihood, not fare well; they will probably never see that money again.
So with no end in sight to Ponzi schemes, here is a look at what all investors should consider to keep their money safe.
WHAT TO LOOK FOR Sadly, the people who are most likely to involve you in a swindle are friends and relatives. It has become so common that it now has its own name: affinity fraud.
Thomas R. Ajamie, managing partner at Ajamie L.L.P., a Houston law firm that specializes in fraud litigation, and co-author of ''Financial Serial Killers: Inside the World of Wall Street Money Hustlers, Swindlers and Con Men,'' said he was baffled when television commentators asked, after Mr. Madoff's scheme collapsed, how a Jew could involve other Jews in his scam. ''That's how it always happens,'' he said. ''Mormons scam Mormons; Baptists scam Baptists. The reason is we trust people we think are like ourselves.''
He said one of the most egregious recent examples of this involved Imperia Invest IBC, whose assets were frozen by the Securities and Exchange Commission in October. According to the S.E.C., Imperia defrauded some 14,000 investors out of $7 million. About $4 million was collected primarily from the deaf.
''They found some deaf people who would ingratiate themselves into the deaf community,'' Mr. Ajamie said. ''It was really vicious, but it was very consistent.''
The other big risk is to associate Ponzi schemes with hedge funds. The reality is that Mr. Madoff and the others who have been caught were not running hedge funds; they were running swindles.
Leon A. LaRosa Jr., a partner at EisnerAmper, an accounting firm, said one of the biggest schemes he had investigated involved $400 million in fake real estate investments in Deal, N.J. The targets were all Syrian Orthodox Jews who met the schemer in their synagogue.
Mr. LaRosa said an even simpler example involved the Brandywine Polo Club in Kennett Square, Pa. A member persuaded his fellow equestrians to contribute a total of $50 million through a unit investment trust that purportedly invested in stocks and bonds.
''The common themes were one, I have a complex strategy that I cannot divulge,'' Mr. LaRosa said. ''And two, I have a strategy that supplies double-digit returns year after year.''
HOW NOT TO GET TAKEN The value of doing research before investing cannot be overstated. But few people take the time to really do it.
One of the first things Mr. Ajamie does when someone who has been conned walks into his office is a Google search of the accused schemer. ''It sounds so simple, but you'd never believe how many people have complaints against them,'' he said. ''I'll say, 'Did you even look the guy's name up?' They'll say, 'No, because this lady at church recommended him.' ''
So how should people go about researching an investment? Randy Shain, an executive vice president at First Advantage Investigative Services, had several suggestions. First, he said, an investor should ask the manager of the fund what institutions have invested with him. If the manager has been in the business for decades yet has not secured any institutional investments, that should be a warning sign, he said.
Second, people should consider the manager's pedigree and ask where he learned how to manage money. ''I don't want to hear, 'I've been trading my own account for 10 years,' '' he said. Related to that is knowing who the manager's bosses were at those places.
Mr. Shain admitted that such research might be difficult to do. He suggested that potential investors instead go through firms that do the vetting for them. ''People are going to say that funds of funds are expensive or consultants charge a fee,'' Mr. Shain said. ''The answer to that is, of course they do. But what do you care if you end up with more money at the end of the day than you would have had without them?''
Another approach is to make sure that all your investment eggs are not in one basket. Jim Kelly, a founder of HedgeServ and a 30-year veteran of the hedge fund industry, said one of the easiest things investors could do was insist that a hedge fund use different firms for the three main services it needs: a clearinghouse to buy and sell securities, a custodian to hold the money and an administrator to ensure that the value of the assets is correct. Having one firm do all three is a recipe for disaster.
''I've seen that Chinese walls don't work,'' he said. ''The way to make it work is to have independent service providers.''
WHAT IF YOU'RE A VICTIM? If you have been caught up in a Ponzi scheme, most of the time there are not a lot of great options.
The people who have the best chance of getting any money back are usually the biggest losers. John V. Donnelly III, a lawyer with Cozen O'Connor in Philadelphia, said he helped a client keep $1.3 million he had withdrawn from supposedly high-yielding certificates of deposit he had bought from a former Texas financier, R. Allen Stanford, accused of masterminding a $7 billion Ponzi scheme. The problem was that Mr. Donnelly's client had invested $3 million.
As for the so-called net winners -- people who withdrew more than they put in -- Mr. Donnelly said they would have to return the money unless they could prove they were destitute.
Often, the person who loses millions does not suffer as much as the small investor who loses $50,000. That small investor may not be able to afford the legal fees to recover anything, however devastating the losses are.
The reality is that most people will never get their money back. And that is why it is so important to do the research first.
''It's like if you don't hold your child's hand and he darts out into the middle of the road and gets hit,'' Mr. Ajamie said. ''What are you going to do? Hire a lawyer and sue the guy?''

HEADLINE: China's Tirades Are Partly Aimed at Home Audience

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting. Zhang Jing, Ashley Li and Benjamin Haas contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- As much of the world on Friday focused their eyes on the empty seat in Oslo that starkly represented the absence of the Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, a lone Chinese blogger posted the image of a chair on the country's most popular microblogging site.
Within minutes, it had been deleted by a censor's unseen hand. 
That small gesture of solidarity with Mr. Liu, who is serving an 11-year prison sentence for ''subversion of state power,'' is largely emblematic of China's sweeping effort to quash any expression of sympathy for a man whose plight has captivated the world.
All mentions of the pageantry at the award ceremony on Friday were scrubbed from the Chinese Internet, and the relatively small number of people who have access to overseas news outlets such as BBC and CNN saw their television screens go black in the days leading up the ceremony. On Friday night, the most discussed topics on Sina, the largest news portal, included plunging temperatures and flight delays at Beijing's airport.
To those outside China, the government's response to the Norwegian committee's decision to give Mr. Liu the Nobel Peace Prize was remarkable for its bombast and audacity.
Beijing dispatched its diplomats to warn countries against sending envoys to the ceremony, while the Foreign Ministry and state media issued a steady drumbeat of invective, describing the prize as a Western plot to hold back a rising China and branding the award's supporters as ''clowns.'' On Friday, Global Times, a populist tabloid affiliated with the party-owned People's Daily, called the event a ''political farce'' and Oslo a ''cult center.''
But while such outbursts may have provoked snickers around the world, the stern-faced men who run China's government may have the last laugh. Minxin Pei, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in California, said those who focus solely on the damage done to Beijing's global image are missing the point. In the end, he said, the only opinions that matter are those held by China's 1.3 billion citizens.
''After Tiananmen, China suffered three years of international isolation, but it recovered,'' he said, referring to the violent crackdown of pro-democracy protesters in 1989. ''The regime's approach to the Nobel was strategic. They know the world will come calling again because China and its economy cannot be ignored for long.''
After the prize was announced, China's censors promptly took measures to stymie the spread of the news via the Internet and text messaging, while police agents began detaining and harassing liberal colleagues and supporters.
But once they realized they could not control the debate beyond their nation's borders from seeping into China, Mr. Pei and other analysts say, senior leaders decided to tailor their message to the domestic audience. Although the Chinese government has become increasingly adept at controlling information available to its 440 million Internet users, several people with knowledge of the government's deliberations said the Nobel Prize presented propaganda officials with a daunting challenge: how to smear what many ordinary Chinese see as honor without fanning interest in Mr. Liu.
Within a few days of the announcement, China's Politburo met to complete a game plan: Mr. Liu would be painted as a traitor and the Nobel committee's decision would be officially labeled a ''plot by Western enemy forces, headed by the United States,'' according to a veteran journalist at a party-run media outlet who had knowledge of the deliberations.
Wielding rhetoric redolent of the Maoist era, a succession of commentaries soon appeared that played on nationalistic sentiment by highlighting Mr. Liu's affiliation with an American pro-democracy group. Others pulled quotes from an interview he gave to a Hong Kong magazine in 1988 in which he described colonialism as the antidote to China's problems. (Supporters say his remarks were incendiary to make a point about China's dysfunction.)
In every article about him, Mr. Liu was described as a criminal who had been tried and convicted by the nation's justice system.
At the same time, the censors assiduously removed information about Mr. Liu not approved by the propaganda ministry, including any mention at all of Charter 08, the pro-democracy manifesto that he helped shape and that led to his conviction.
The intense media controls appear to have had the desired effect. According to the veteran party journalist, an official survey of university students taken since the prize was awarded found that 85 percent said they knew nothing about Mr. Liu and Charter 08.
Although it is not clear exactly when the survey was taken, that figure was partly borne out Friday in conversations with more than three dozen people across the capital, many of them students at two of the country's top universities. One student said she thought the Nobel recipient was the Dalai Lama (he won in 1989) and another insisted that the award ceremony had long since taken place. Most said they had no idea who Mr. Liu was, but a handful quietly voiced support for him and his ideas.
Even if they did not know his name, those who were aware that a Chinese citizen was the recipient said they agreed with the government that his selection was a plot to embarrass China.
Xiao Feng, 27, said she thought the recipient had probably done something to harm the nation. ''I think this year's prize is a little bit unfair,'' she said. ''From what I can tell, its purpose is to humiliate China.''

HEADLINE: Indexes, Riding Positive Signs, End Week on Up Note

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Friday, helped by an encouraging report on the nation's balance of trade, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reaching its highest level since the week Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. 
Indexes closed near session highs, with the Nasdaq up for its eighth consecutive daily gain. The index posted a gain of 5.5 percent over the period and finished at its highest level since Dec. 31, 2007.
Industrial shares led the gainers, with General Electric up more than 3 percent after it raised its dividend for a second time this year. The S.& P. industrial sector index rose 1.03 percent.
Indicators followed by analysts who study technical factors, like trends on price charts, also encouraged buying.
Analysts said the S.& P. 500's ability to close above 1,228, which was considered a significant level on price charts, for a second straight session was a sign of strength.
''That met some significant resistance, so closing above there and staying above there is a pretty good sign,'' said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company in Boston.
The S.& P. 500 appeared headed toward 1,228 in April and in early November, with both attempts followed by steep declines.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.26 points, or 0.35 percent, to 11,410.32. The S.& P 500-stock index gained 7.40 points, or 0.60 percent, to 1,240.40. The Nasdaq rose 20.87 points, or 0.80 percent, to 2,637.54.
For the week, the indexes also posted gains. The Dow rose 0.2 percent, the S.& P. 500 was up 1.3 percent and the Nasdaq added 1.8 percent.
The Nasdaq was helped by a 2.3 percent gain in shares of Oracle, which closed at $29.94.
In the latest signs of improvement in the nation's economic recovery, data showed consumer sentiment rose more than expected in early December, according to the Thomson Reuters-University of Michigan survey, while import prices in November climbed at their fastest rate in a year.
Another positive signal came from the Commerce Department, which said the United States trade deficit narrowed more than expected in October.
Overseas news helped equities, after data showed China's imports and exports jumped in November, bank lending topped forecasts and property investment powered ahead. China increased reserve requirements for banks.
G.E. rose 3.4 percent to $17.72 after the company said quarterly payments to shareholders will increase by 2 cents to 14 cents a share.
Lifting the S.& P. health care index, Tenet Healthcare rose 55 percent to $6.65, easily surpassing the $6-per-share bid from Community Health Systems and most likely forcing Community to raise its bid. Community Health shares rose 13.4 percent to $35.89 and the S.& P. health care index was up 0.9 percent.
Shares of Netflix rose after Standard & Poor's said the company -- along with F5 Networks, Newfield Exploration and Cablevision Systems -- would be added to the S.& P. 500-stock index after trading closes next Friday.
Netflix added 1.9 percent to $194.63, Cablevision jumped 4.1 percent to $34.72, Newfield gained 3.3 percent to $72.37 and F5 Networks rose 3 percent to $143.09.

HEADLINE: U.S. Deficit In Trade Narrowed In October

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit narrowed in October to its lowest level since early this year, the government reported Friday, with exports to China hitting a high.
The Commerce Department said the trade gap was $38.7 billion in October, the smallest since January, when it was $34.8 billion. 
Imports declined 0.5 percent, to $197.4 billion, while exports rose 3.2 percent, to $158.7 billion, the highest level in more than a year.
Economists had forecast a deficit of $43.8 billion in October. The latest trade figures, including the smaller-than-expected deficit, could contribute to revisions to estimates for fourth-quarter economic growth in the United States.
''Today's report on the narrowing of the trade deficit is good news all the way around,'' Steven Blitz, a senior economist for ITG Investment Research, said. ''Building a recovery around export growth and the capital investment needed to bolster that sector is necessary for the U.S. economy to have a well-balanced and sustainable growth path.''
The trade deficit for September was revised to $44.6 billion, from $44 billion.
The October report suggested an ''upside risk'' to fourth-quarter estimates of 2.5 percent annualized growth in real gross domestic product, Goldman Sachs economists said.
The report would add 0.5 percent to fourth-quarter growth if sustained, Steven Ricchiuto, the chief economist for Mizuho Securities, said.
The increase in American exports in October reflected a rise in sales of a variety of goods abroad, mostly industrial supplies and materials; food, feed and beverages; and automotive vehicles, parts and engines, the department reported on Friday.
Exports swelled to record highs with two important United States trading partners. American exports to Mexico, including natural gas, fuel oil and soybeans, hit a high in October of $15.4 billion, but the deficit with Mexico was virtually unchanged at $5.8 billion, the figures showed.
And exports to China, primarily soybeans, reached $9.3 billion in October, the highest on record and shrinking the trade deficit with that Asian country to $25.5 billion in October, from $27.8 billion in September.
''The United States is always looking to balance the consumer goods that we import from Asia with commodities that we can export to them,'' Mr. Blitz said.
The value of total soybean exports has been climbing over the years, reaching $16.9 billion in 2009 from $6.6 billion in 2005, government figures show.

HEADLINE: Negotiators at Global Climate Talks Continue Past the Deadline for an Agreement

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; John Collins Rudolf contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
CANCUN, Mexico -- Negotiators blew past a self-imposed deadline for reaching an agreement at the United Nations conference on climate change here on Friday, working into the night to try to piece together a package acceptable to the nearly 200 participating countries.
It appeared that delegates had resolved many of the most difficult issues, among them how to keep the frayed 1997 Kyoto Protocol from falling apart and how to ensure that countries were making progress toward their goals of reducing emissions that contribute to global warming. The documents that negotiators were debating Friday evening added new details to the bare-bones Copenhagen Accord, reached a year ago at the end of a contentious conference and never formally adopted by the parties. 
The climate conference was concluding on the same day that NASA announced that the past 12 months had produced the highest land and ocean temperatures ever recorded. The data mean that 2010 is likely to pass 2005 as the warmest year since detailed records have been kept.
In this seaside resort, the complex texts produced by negotiators over the past two weeks still needed the approval of the delegates, a process expected to prolong the conference deep into the night. There was no certainty that they would win the consensus that the United Nations process requires.
As debate opened late Friday, Todd Stern, the American climate envoy, urged delegates to adopt the proposal, calling it a balanced package that lays the groundwork for future progress. ''So let's get this deal done and put the world on a path for a low-emissions and more sustainable future,'' he said.
Patricia Espinosa, the foreign secretary of Mexico and the chairwoman of the talks, had hoped to wrap up the negotiations by 6 p.m. But that deadline passed as the negotiators weighed new language that most of them did not see until late in the afternoon.
At stake was not just the success or failure of this conference, the 16th annual meeting under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Many delegates and analysts warned that failure to reach some sort of accord, even a modest, face-saving deal that pushes the tough questions off into the future, could doom the entire process.
''If we do not get things done here in Cancun, it's very difficult to see how you get from A to B,'' said Connie Hedegaard, the European Union's top climate negotiator. ''If we leave Cancun without getting anything out of this, I think multilateralism has a problem.''
China and the United States, the world's largest emitters of heat-trapping gases, appeared to have agreed Friday night on a formula for ensuring that all nations were adhering to their pledges to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. The accord sets standards for reporting actions each country is taking to cut its emissions, with requirements for detailed statements of data, economic assumptions and methodology. That seemed to satisfy American concerns that countries could manipulate the emissions and economic data they submitted for international review.
As technical experts worked on details and diplomatic language, many of the participants were asking broader questions about the future of the talks, which have yet to produce an effective and binding agreement.
''Climate change is a long-term problem that won't be addressed in one meeting or one agreement,'' said Robert N. Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at Harvard University and a longtime observer of the United Nations process. ''Countries are already taking actions on their own and moving toward international cooperation on these issues. That may be a more productive course than a single, stand-alone, top-down agreement.''
The climate itself was not waiting for the outcome of the talks. An analysis of average global temperatures released Friday by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies shows that 2010 has so far been the warmest year in its 130-year climate record. The record-breaking temperatures appeared due to a combination of man-made climate change and a natural warming pattern in the tropical Pacific Ocean earlier this year caused by El Nino, according to Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
The year was marked by extreme weather events, from a record-breaking heat wave in Russia in July to the dramatic floods in Pakistan. High sea temperatures were also blamed for a global bleaching of coral reefs.
A cold snap under way in Britain and northern Europe was unusual, but would do little to alter global average temperatures for the year, said James Hansen, director of the Goddard Institute. ''This regional cold spell has caused widespread commentary that global warming has ended,'' Dr. Hansen said. ''That is hardly the case.''

HEADLINE: The Economic Sweet Spot of Presidential Terms

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
THE American economy, and the American stock market, tend to do much better when a president's term is nearing an end than they do when the term is beginning. If that pattern continues, the news from both Wall Street and Main Street may get better over the next two years.
For the stock market, the sweet spot is usually the third year of a presidential term, which is 2011 for the Obama administration. The stock market often leads the economy, and that seems to be the case in presidential cycles. The fourth year, on average, has seen the most economic growth. 
The pattern is not perfect, of course. The stock market recorded only small gains in 2007, the third year of George W. Bush's second term as president, and there was no economic growth the following year, as a severe recession got under way.
Still, in the years from 1946 through 2009, 62 percent of the American economy's growth came during the final two years of presidential terms, compared with 38 percent in the first two years. A third of the growth came in the fourth years.
The stock market pattern was even more marked. An investor who owned stocks during the third years of terms, and stayed out of the market during the other years, would have earned profits more than twice as great as those that went to an investor following the opposite strategy, owning stocks in all but the third years.
Obviously many things that affect the economy are unrelated to presidential terms, and happen whether or not the government wants them to. Mr. Bush did not want the financial crisis to be the defining event of the last two years of his term, and Mr. Obama has been bitterly disappointed by how slow the recovery has been.
But presidents do have choices to make, and they do matter. One popular theory has been that presidents approaching re-election, or nearing the end of their second term and hoping to have their performance ratified by keeping the White House in the same party, are more likely to find ways to stimulate the economy and thus spur both growth and share prices. Tough economic policies can wait.
Until this week, it appeared that might not happen in 2011. Both parties were proclaiming a devotion to reducing budget deficits despite the weak recovery. But President Obama and Republican leaders reached an agreement that largely adopted tax cuts supported by both parties and added in the extended unemployment benefits favored by Democrats. The economic impact is likely to be stimulative.
The accompanying charts show performance of the stock market and the economy by years of presidential terms since World War II. The stock market figures show the total return of the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, adjusted for inflation. Investors suffered losses in only one third year, 1946. The median rise after inflation during third years was 18 percent. By contrast, the market has gone down more often than it has risen during second years of terms.
The economic figures are based on annual change in gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation. During the 64-year period, the compound average gain was 3.2 percent a year. But most years in the first half of terms fell short of that total, and just half of the third years went up by that much. But three-quarters of fourth years were above average.
The subpar fourth years were 1956, 1960, 1980 and 2008. In three of those years -- all except 1956 -- the incumbent party lost the White House.
There are other patterns evident in the data. Most years in the 1980s and 1990s saw better-than-average economic growth. But in only one of the 10 years from 2001 though 2010 -- 2004 -- was growth at least 3.2 percent. Over the same period, the stock market did not keep pace with inflation.

HEADLINE: In Italy, a Political Opera About Opera

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
MILAN -- La Scala opened this week with a new and in many respects outstanding production of Wagner's ''Walkure.'' No matter how much opera has declined as a popular pastime in this country, the start of the season here remains the grandest event on the Italian cultural calendar, attracting glitterati and heads of state who pay roughly the price of a used Alfa for a ticket and the chance to preen before paparazzi and television cameras.
It's more than a social event. It's a political and symbolic one too, and in the end countless Italians care, or profess to, about the quality of the music. The performance is big news. There's no equivalent elsewhere in Europe, or in America. 
As usual, Giorgio Napolitano, the president of Italy, occupied the royal box. Mr. Napolitano, a former Communist and, it turns out, devoted Wagnerite, is one of the few Italian politicians who still enjoys general respect here. By contrast, absent, also as usual, was Silvio Berlusconi, the country's beleaguered prime minister, who lately unburdened himself, yet again, of his view that culture doesn't matter much to him, a remark that might raise eyebrows in a nation so economically dependent on the arts. But by now almost nothing Mr. Berlusconi does raises eyebrows.
Almost nothing. Newspapers here and in Bulgaria have been reporting that he enlisted Sandro Bondi, his culture minister, to concoct some bogus award at the Venice Film Festival in September for a 39-year-old Bulgarian actress, Michelle Bonev, a supposed friend of Mr. Berlusconi's. Some $530,000 in state funds were said to have been spent to fly her and her entourage to the festival, and Rai Cinema, which oversees film for the Italian state broadcaster, was said to have been instructed to pay more than $1.3 million for the rights to screen a film that Ms. Bonev produced, directed and acted in.
Investigators from the Italian court of auditors are looking into all this. At the La Scala opening, for the second year in a row, Mr. Bondi was conspicuously absent, prompting detractors to say he was afraid to face protesters, including the hundreds massed outside the theater before the opera started, who clashed violently with the police over, among other things, cuts to the national arts budget by Mr. Berlusconi's government.
Inside, Daniel Barenboim, the company's chief guest conductor, delivered a short preperformance speech from the podium, also condemning the cuts. He read from Article 9 of the Italian Constitution, promising protection for ''the historical and artistic heritage of the nation.'' The crowd cheered. As proposed, cuts threaten to derail La Scala's 2011-12 season and could shut down landmark theaters elsewhere, including the historic one in Genoa, which, unlike La Scala, can't count on rich private patrons to make up for shortfalls.
For his part, Mr. Bondi brushed off the cowardice charge, telling the Italian news media that he had to be in Rome for a Senate vote on the new finance bill and adding that, anyway, he was inured to attacks by now, having endured a slew of them because of recent building collapses at Pompeii, the archaeological site. It was as if his mental health, as opposed to the bankruptcy of Italian leadership in caring for the nation's priceless heritage, were the point.
Mr. Berlusconi's contempt for culture and Mr. Bondi's excuses notwithstanding, what's striking to an outsider about all this is the extent to which the state of Italy's opera houses, and of the arts more broadly, remains central to public discourse, to national identity and Italian pride, even if most Italians today do not actually attend operas or visit museums. In Britain, where cuts made to many public programs have incited increasing protests, including an attack on a car carrying Prince Charles this week, the government bought the argument by arts leaders that culture acts as a public-relations boon and economic engine. Cuts to national arts institutions ended up being relatively modest as a result.
Here, though, proposed cuts could be crippling, and while it's true that, as in many other areas of Italian bureaucracy, the country's cultural institutions support an indecent number of do-nothing jobs and an entrenched union system that protects those jobs, safeguarding the cultural heritage, as a matter of economic and moral good sense, is, if anything, more urgent in Italy than in Britain. What happens at Pompeii and La Scala reflects on this nation and its global reputation more so than Britain's standing rests on Stonehenge and Covent Garden.
Maybe this accounts for why Italian headlines trumpeted ''Die Walkure'' on opening night and even gave a pass to the gloomy and inscrutable sets and to the opera's director, Guy Cassiers.
Give him credit. Unlike many other European directors, Mr. Cassiers at least respects music and text. But amid the spinning disco balls, glowing heat lamps, slow-motion videos of writhing dancers and spewing volcanoes, and the neon-red rods of light hung like vines above the stage for no ostensible reason, his endearing faith in the acting abilities of opera singers left them mugging helplessly and otherwise standing around, as if clueless about what to do. ''Walkure'' is an intimate opera, a suite of close encounters among characters who pour out their hearts at great length to one another, more often than they spill one another's guts. It requires from a director and cast extreme subtlety and strength, understatement and power.
Fortunately, Mr. Barenboim extracted them and more from the orchestra, propelling the music where required, letting the score breathe, giving it depth and tragedy and providing the singers space to whisper and soar.
It was only a pity that Simon O'Neill, the Siegmund, usually a splendid singer, was feeling ill, and that Vitalij Kowaljow, replacing an indisposed Rene Pape, delivered a solid and honorable but slightly wan performance as Wotan. Otherwise, John Tomlinson thundered as Hunding. Ekaterina Gubanova was a fantastically vindictive and fresh-voiced Fricka; and Waltraud Meier, not in tip-top shape, either, was nevertheless profound and moving as Sieglinde.
As for Brunnhilde, Nina Stemme sang gloriously. It's hard to recall anyone's sounding more commanding or at ease in the part, and that includes Kirsten Flagstad.
Flowers rained down on Ms. Stemme from the peanut gallery during curtain calls, as they did on Mr. Barenboim and the rest of the cast -- even on a beaming Mr. Cassiers. Italian papers the next morning gloated over the 14-minute ovation.
No wonder. Italy's government may be teetering. But for one night, the whole country had something to cheer about.

PERSON: James T. Lynn 

HEADLINE: James T. Lynn, 83, Former Budget Director

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
James T. Lynn, a housing secretary in the Nixon administration who cut government spending as President Gerald R. Ford's budget director died on Monday in Bethesda, Md. He was 83.
The cause was a heart attack, said his son, J. Peter Lynn.
Mr. Lynn served in the federal government for seven years under both President Richard M. Nixon and Mr. Ford. He was named chief executive of Aetna Life and Casualty, the giant insurance company, in 1984 and ran it until 1992. As chief, he slashed jobs to bolster profits. 
A Harvard-educated lawyer, Mr. Lynn joined the Nixon administration as the Commerce Department's general counsel in 1970. He became the department's under secretary the following year before being appointed secretary of housing and urban development in 1973, a post he held till 1975.
At the housing department, Mr. Lynn helped design and oversee a multibillion-dollar community development and housing program for low- and moderate-income families and worked with the White House on urban renewal initiatives and legislation outlawing racial and sexual discrimination in the way the federal financing was disbursed.
Mr. Lynn was appointed director of the Office of Management and Budget in 1975 and served in the post until 1977, at a time when the nation was grappling with higher deficits and a weak recovery.
Mr. Lynn clashed with government agencies and lobbyists as he sought to reduce spending. Adopting an orthodox view, he said in 1976 that a projected budget deficit estimated at $60 billion was ''very scary'' and would ''wreck'' the economy.
After Jimmy Carter defeated President Ford in 1976, Mr. Lynn left the government to join Aetna's board. He was picked to be the company's chairman and chief executive in 1984 after the sudden retirement of John H. Filer.
Mr. Lynn joined Aetna at a troubled time for the insurer, which was gripped by falling profits, poor morale and a failed strategy to diversify the business. Although he had never sold a policy or calculated a premium, his appointment was well received by Wall Street, where analysts were looking for someone to shake up the company.
In 1990, Mr. Lynn announced the layoff of 2,600 people -- about 6 percent of the total staff -- to help save the company $50 million.
James Thomas Lynn was born on Feb. 27, 1927, in Cleveland. He graduated from what is now Case Western Reserve University in 1948, then studied law at Harvard, where he graduated summa cum laude in 1951. He was hired by the law firm Jones Day in Washington, where he rapidly became its youngest managing director. At office functions, he sang in a quartet with another young lawyer, Antonin Scalia, who is now a Supreme Court justice.
Mr. Lynn's singing abilities were mentioned by The New York Times in an article about departing Ford administration officials in 1977. It said he was considering ''striking out as a Broadway librettist, testing a talent dormant since college days.''
One tune was running through his mind at the time, Mr. Lynn said: ''Is That All There Is?''
Besides his son, of San Diego, Mr. Lynn, who lived in Bethesda, is survived by his wife, Joan Miller Lynn, and two daughters, Marjorie Lynn Wilson of Bethesda and Sarah Lynn Hechler of North Potomac, Md.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 14, 2010

 CORRECTION:
A picture on Saturday with an obituary about James T. Lynn, the budget director for President Gerald R. Ford, was published in error. The photograph was of Paul O'Neill, Mr. Lynn's deputy, in 1975 -- not of Mr. Lynn. And the obituary misstated the amount of time Mr. Lynn spent in the Nixon and Ford administrations. It was seven years, not 17. (The combined presidencies of Richard M. Nixon and Mr. Ford lasted only eight years.)

HEADLINE: How Will History Judge Obama's Leadership?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''No Deficit of Courage,'' by Jon Meacham (Op-Ed, Dec. 9), makes the case that President Obama's recent political decisions showed courage and may win the good opinion of history. 
But what Mr. Obama calls the ''sanctimonious'' left is not so much angry at the compromises that are a part of any political process. Obama voters like me are apoplectic that the president does not seem to be steering the ship of state so much as he is making minor course corrections to the routes dictated by the minority party.
We don't want Mr. Obama ''falling on his sword,'' in the words of President George H. W. Bush -- we just want to see that he has one!
I never thought I would agree with anything Sarah Palin had to say, but she suggested that the country needed a leader, not a law professor. I'm afraid she's right -- ouch!
I believe that the legacy of Mr. Obama will be less like that of the first President Bush and more like that of the thoughtful and well-meaning but ultimately hapless Jimmy Carter.
You've got the bully pulpit, Mr. President -- please use it!
G. Steve Jordan Stone Ridge, N.Y., Dec. 9, 2010
To the Editor:
As a lifelong Democrat, I found Jon Meacham's comparison of President Obama to George H. W. Bush interesting, but I would draw a rather different conclusion from it.
In 1990, Mr. Bush broke his campaign promise and appropriately raised taxes. In 2010, Mr. Obama has cowered from doing what is clearly right for the country -- ending the George W. Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans -- thus violating his campaign rhetoric of support for middle- and working-class Americans, not to mention his commitment to change.
Mr. Obama's embrace of the Republican position on taxation won't be lauded someday as courageous because George H. W. Bush was right about something else: The trickle-down theory is ''voodoo economics.''

HEADLINE: Wrong Fix for British Universities

 BODY:
There can be no excuse for the behavior of a minority of student protestors in Britain, who battled police, smashed windows and attacked a car carrying Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, this week. The legislation they opposed, a tripling of university tuition fees, is bad public policy, both myopic and unfair. 
It only squeaked through Parliament after multiple defections from the government's junior coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats. Its support by the remaining Liberal Democrats, led by Nick Clegg, the party leader, cannot be easily justified.
Opposing these tuition increases was a central plank of the Liberal Democrats' election program last spring. Since joining the coalition government, Mr. Clegg has been far too willing to endorse the Conservative's harsh austerity program, which imposes five-year across-the-board spending cuts of nearly 20 percent.
It takes some of its cruelest bites out of higher education, an investment in future growth that should have been spared but wasn't. Funds for undergraduate teaching, for example, will be cut by 80 percent. Higher tuition fees will have to plug the gap.
The new legislation raises the cap on university tuition fees from $4,800 per year to $14,500 a year by 2012. While the fees may still look good to some Americans (they are about half the average level of American private universities but nearly double the average charged by public universities here), the increase is too much, too fast and would not be needed without the arbitrary spending cuts.
The law requires students to repay these fees only after they graduate, with payments calibrated to future earnings. That adds a progressive twist.
But educators warn that the poor and middle-class students who have finally gained access to British universities in recent decades will be squeezed out again by the prospect of decades of future indebtedness. Compounding the problem, government payments meant to allow students from poorer families to finish high school are also being phased out.
Britain's crisis-swollen budget deficits, like America's, need to be brought down as the economy recovers. The cutting must be done wisely, protecting investments in the economic future, like education. The sacrifices must be equitably shared. By any of those terms, this new policy is an utter failure.

HEADLINE: Harder Push To Stop Iran From Making Nuclear Fuel

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's chief nuclear adviser said Friday that the United States and its allies planned new sanctions in an effort to test ''Iran's pain threshold'' and force the country into suspending its production of nuclear fuel.
The adviser, Gary Samore, made his comments three days after talks with Iranian officials adjourned with no progress. 
By increasing the economic pressure, White House officials say, they hope to raise the cost to the Iranian leadership of letting the talks drag on. But it is possible, some concede, that the Iranians could react by pulling out of the discussions. The talks, held this week in Geneva, were the first in a year, and are supposed to be followed by more meetings next month, probably in Turkey.
Mr. Samore suggested that Iran may have decided to resume the talks with members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany ''because it believes it can manipulate the appearance of negotiations to weaken existing sanctions and avoid additional measures.''
''This ploy will not work,'' he said in a speech at a conference held Friday by the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. ''In the wake of the Geneva talks, we and our allies are determined to maintain and even increase pressure. We need to send the message to Iran that sanctions will only increase if Iran avoids serious negotiations and will not be lifted until our concerns are fully addressed.''
Mr. Samore was not specific about the sanctions being considered.
Washington's options are limited. Many European nations are reluctant to support the one step -- limiting Iran's oil exports -- that many believe would hurt the regime the most because a true embargo would ripple through the world economy. The White House has been reluctant to impose curbs on the delivery of refined petroleum to Iran, fearing that gasoline shortages would make Iranian civilians more angry at the West than at their own government.
The current sanctions, imposed by the Security Council in the spring and embellished by the United States, some European nations, Japan and Australia, are making it increasingly difficult for Iranian businesses and the government to conduct banking operations around the world, to get insurance for shipping lines and to refuel airliners at some airports in Europe.
But these sanctions have yet to persuade Iran's leadership to heed the Security Council's demands that the country stop enriching uranium and answer a series of questions from international nuclear inspectors.
Mr. Samore expressed optimism that the situation could be changed. ''I think what Iran is prepared to do will depend on their cost-benefit analysis,'' he said. ''If the costs and the risks are high enough, they will accept suspension.''
Some other Iran experts have disagreed, arguing that the country's senior leadership, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, are less likely to give in under pressure.
Mr. Samore has been coordinating the effort to delay and ultimately derail Iran's nuclear program. In recent weeks he has said that if Iran obtains a nuclear weapon, it could lead to proliferation in the Middle East and undermine Mr. Obama's efforts to nudge the world to reduce nuclear stockpiles.
Asked about the effects of the Stuxnet computer worm, which appears to have been directed at disrupting Iran's centrifuges, Mr. Samore was careful to avoid saying who might have been responsible for the attack.
But he added with a smile, ''I'm glad to hear they are having troubles with their centrifuge machines, and the U.S. and its allies are doing everything we can to make it more complicated.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and China Often Worked Closely on Myanmar, Documents Show

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

 BODY:
BANGKOK -- As the United States searches for new ways to nudge Myanmar toward democratic change, it may find an unexpected ally in China, according to secret diplomatic cables.
Internal State Department correspondence made public by WikiLeaks shows a much less adversarial relationship between the United States and China over Myanmar than the language of official statements or years of posturing at the United Nations might suggest.
Chinese officials acknowledge their differences with the United States but appear to share American frustrations at the junta's handling of the country's economy and at times show impatience at the slow pace of political change.
''The Chinese clearly are fed up with the footdragging by the Than Shwe regime,'' Shari Villarosa, the head of the United States mission in Myanmar, said in a confidential cable in January 2008 that referred to the country's aging dictator, Senior Gen. Than Shwe. 
''The Chinese share our desire to get them to the negotiating table,'' Ms. Villarosa said in a note to Washington after hosting the Chinese ambassador, Guan Mu, for lunch.
China and the United States both want the same thing in Myanmar, said an official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yang Jian, according to a separate January 2008 cable: ''stability, democracy and development.''
''Therefore, China and the United States should show unity, particularly in the U.N., in addressing the situation in Burma,'' the cable is quoted as saying.
Over the past two decades, politics in Myanmar have unfolded with a good-and-evil storyline fit for Hollywood: a brutal military government has persecuted a democratic opposition movement led by a pretty and charming freedom fighter, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize who until last month was under house arrest. When a landslide victory by Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi in 1990 was ignored by the generals, Western nations lined up behind her. China and other neighboring countries, by contrast, lined up to invest in natural gas ventures and buy timber and gems.
But what comes across in nearly 400 cables relating to Myanmar and sent by American diplomats over the past three years is a more nuanced picture. The diplomats report the tyrannical tendencies of the junta but also point out many problems with the ''sclerotic'' leadership of a democratic opposition and its undemocratic ways. Some American diplomats are privately convinced by the argument put forward by many Asian countries that sanctions do more harm than good, a view that runs contrary to official American policy.
One cable from 2008 describes the party of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi as very poorly managed -- ''not the last great hope for democracy and Burma,'' the cable says -- and dominated by its ''Uncles,'' the party elders.
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi remains ''popular and beloved,'' the cable says, but her party is ''strictly hierarchical, new ideas are not solicited or encouraged from younger members and the Uncles regularly expel members they believe are 'too active,' '' said the cable's author, Leslie Hayden, who was the head of the political and economic section in 2008. The same cable, which was described as a ''candid'' assessment of American policy after two years in the country, described sanctions as doing little good.
''While our economic sanctions give us the moral high-ground, they are largely ineffective because they are not comprehensive.'' Ms. Hayden wrote. ''Burma's biggest client states refuse to participate in them.''
The cables show Washington's determined support for pro-democracy groups and dissidents opposing the military government. Ms. Villarosa reported that the embassy made a point of inviting dissidents and democracy activists to its diplomatic functions as a way of demonstrating its ''commitment to promoting freedom and democracy.''
But diplomats also reported a deep skepticism toward some elements of the Burmese pro-democracy movement. A detailed cable from the embassy in Thailand in May 2008 sharply criticized some Burmese exile groups that were described as out of touch with reality in Myanmar and that had ''lost credibility.'' Thailand is home to a large number of Burmese pro-democracy activists.
''At present, it is unclear whether the principal leaders of the exile community in Thailand can act as credible agents for change in Burma,'' said Eric G. John, whose tour as the ambassador to Thailand ended this month.
The attitudes in the cables toward the Burmese government are predictably skeptical. But the tone changes according to the personality of the diplomats.
Ms. Villarosa is energetic and opinionated in her cables. ''Than Shwe is mad with power,'' she thundered in one note to Washington. ''The senior generals are terrified of losing control over Burma and determined to crush any sign of dissent.''
Larry M. Dinger, the head of mission who replaced her, sends more measured missives.
''These are career military men, most with combat experience in Burma's past internal conflicts, who value the unity and stability of the state as a top priority,'' he said in a secret memorandum last year. ''The senior generals assert, and seem genuinely to believe, that the military is the only guarantor of that unity and stability.'' He also called the generals ''xenophobic'' and ''craving respect.''
It emerges clearly in the cables that the United States and China do not agree on all issues related to Myanmar. They disagreed on the usefulness of visits by a United Nations envoy, and the Chinese repeatedly tell the Americans that the economic sanctions are counterproductive.
''The Chinese Embassy regularly rebuffs requests for meetings and information from the Rangoon-based diplomatic community,'' says the cable. The same cable described China's economic dominance in Myanmar: ''China's economic presence in Burma has increased dramatically over the last 10 years.''
The cables yielded a number of other items:
The United States sought in October 2008 to remove the United Nations special envoy for Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari, calling him ''unrealistically upbeat'' and unable to obtain access to the country's top leaders.
The Myanmar government appears to have initiated the re-engagement with the United States pursued by the Obama administration. In a February 2009 cable, Mr. Dinger wrote of ''repeated recent signals'' by the government to restart a dialogue. But Mr. Dinger wrote that the offer for closer ties appeared ''symbolic rather than substantive.''
Another cable recounts the ultimately unsuccessful efforts of Mr. Gambari to meet Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi during a visit in August 2008. He sent two assistants to the gates of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's villa. She snubbed him, as did most of the senior Burmese leadership during that visit, according to the cable.
Several cables in 2004 report possible but unconfirmed signs of the junta's developing a nuclear program with help from North Korea. But in a November 2009 cable Mr. Dinger described the possibility of a nuclear program as a ''very open question.''

HEADLINE: Estate Tax Cutoff Draws Special Fire in Congress

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House has worked aggressively to shift attention from the plan to continue the Bush-era tax cuts for high-income taxpayers and to focus instead on how its deal with Republicans will stimulate the economy. But many Congressional Democrats say one component in the package will stimulate nothing except their continuing fury: a generous tax exemption for wealthy estates that will benefit only a small number of super-rich Americans.
''These guys were outmaneuvered in the negotiation at the price of $25 billion on the national credit card, made payable to 6,600 families,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, who represented House Democrats in the formal negotiations on the tax issue, even as the White House was cutting a deal in secret talks with Republican leaders. ''The estate tax is the choking point for the great majority of our members,'' Mr. Van Hollen said. 
The Senate on Thursday opened its first full day of debate on the $858 billion tax package, and the one person who seemed to have a lot to say about it was its fiercest opponent: Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont. He spent more than eight hours on the floor railing against the plan to continue the tax policies of George W. Bush, as well as the estate tax proposal, which is more generous to wealthy estates than in any year of Mr. Bush's presidency.
''This nation has a record-breaking $13.8 trillion national debt at the same time as the middle class is collapsing and poverty is increasing,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''It seems to me to be unconscionable, unconscionable for my conservative friends and for everybody else in this country to be driving up this already too high national debt by giving tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires who don't need it.''
But Mr. Sanders, like many opponents of the tax plan in the House, directed particular venom at the estate tax provision. ''Ninety-nine point seven percent of American families will not pay one nickel in an estate tax,'' he said. ''This is not a tax on the rich. This is a tax on the very, very, very rich.''
In recent days, a number of Congressional Democrats have said they would get behind the tax cut plan, largely because of its potential to stimulate the economy by keeping jobless aid flowing to the long-term unemployed for an additional 13 months, and providing a one-year, two percentage-point cut in the Social Security payroll tax for nearly all workers.
But some Democrats said there was no excuse for allowing more generous tax treatment of the wealthiest estates.
''We need to focus on reducing that deficit, not adding to it by a ludicrous re-ordering of even the Bush response to the estate tax,'' said Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas. ''And that is to create a $68 billion, if you will, burden on the American people to give an unusual tax relief to an estate of a magnitude that only fits a small number of people -- some 39,000 people out of a 300 million person country.''
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, has scheduled a procedural vote for Monday afternoon, and the bill could be passed by Tuesday night. House Democrats, however, have refused to vote on the bill without further changes. There seems to be growing momentum for a plan to change the estate tax provision and send the bill back to the Senate, in a symbolic, if temporary, display of resistance. The House Democrats would most likely substitute the estate tax parameters that were in place in 2009, with an exemption of $3.5 million per person and a maximum rate of 45 percent.
The agreement between President Obama and the Republicans would set an estate tax exemption of $5 million per person, and a maximum rate of 35 percent, for two years. The estate tax lapsed this year, but is scheduled to return on Jan. 1 with an effective exclusion of $1 million, and a maximum rate of 55 percent.
The provision included in the deal with Republicans mirrors language in an estate tax proposal previously championed by Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican, and Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas.
Mr. Kyl was the lead negotiator for Senate Republicans in the formal tax cut negotiations. At the same time, he was also the lead Republican threatening to hold up the New Start arms control treaty with Russia, a top priority for the White House.
Many Democrats on Capitol Hill believe that Mr. Kyl was able to secure the agreement on the estate tax because of the leverage he held over the arms treaty. Republicans and the White House insist that the two issues were never connected. But Democrats said they did not believe that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who helped nail down the agreement with Republicans, made any effort to negotiate on the estate tax, suggesting the outcome was preordained.
Republicans who have long opposed the estate tax, deriding it as the ''death tax'' and complaining it amounted to double taxation, have said little publicly about it in recent days. Privately, however, many acknowledge that it is a far better deal than they ever expected.
The White House has made no effort to defend the estate tax provision or suggest that there is any economic merit to the proposal. Aides said that Mr. Obama had agreed to it only reluctantly to secure the overall deal.
''It's an imperfect compromise,'' the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said when asked about the unhappiness among many Democratic lawmakers.
Ms. Lincoln, who had previously pressed for a lower estate tax, issued a statement this week praising the agreement, claiming it would aid farmers and small-business owners. ''Uncertainty in the estate tax law has caused incredible difficulties for Arkansas's farmers, ranchers and small businesses,'' she said. ''For the next two years, these individuals will be assured of a reasonable rate and exemption that will allow them to invest.''
Tax analysts say there are very few farmers or small-business owners who would benefit from an exemption above the 2009 level of $3.5 million. But as the senator from Arkansas, Ms. Lincoln counts among her constituents members of the Walton family, which founded Wal-Mart and became very wealthy.

HEADLINE: China Raises Bank Reserve Limits Again

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BEIJING (Reuters) -- For the third time in about a month, China has ordered its banks to increase their reserves, another attempt to cool inflation and curb an increase in lending. 
But the decision to raise banks' required reserves, rather than raise interest rates, means that officials have opted for a milder form of monetary tightening for the time being, suggesting that they believe price pressures are still well within their ability to control.
The 50-basis-point increase, which takes effect on Dec. 20, lifts required reserve ratios to 19 percent for the country's biggest banks, a record high.
The People's Bank of China offered no explanation.
Lu Zhengwei, chief economist at Industrial Bank in Shanghai, said his bank had anticipated the increase, ''and I think it is perfectly timed to help manage excessive liquidity.''
''There is still much scope for the central bank to raise reserve ratios next year,'' he said. ''We expect several increases in the first quarter of next year and the ratio could reach as high as 23 percent in 2011.''
The move came just one week after China's top leaders announced a shift to a ''prudent'' monetary policy from the previous ''moderately loose'' stance.
Analysts said the change of wording could pave the way for more interest rate increases and lending controls.
Chinese stock markets have shed more than 10 percent over the past month on concerns that the government would ratchet up its monetary policy tightening in face of rising inflation.
Chinese consumer price inflation may have hit 5.1 percent in the year to November, a 28-month high, state media reported on Friday. The figure is due to be published on Saturday.
Along with playing a crucial role in the fight against inflation, policy tightening also signals the government's confidence that the world's second-largest economy is on solid ground, even as the United States and European recoveries remain fragile.

HEADLINE: A Tax Deal, and a President, Under Fire

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Obama Defends Tax Deal, but His Party Stays Hostile'' (front page, Dec. 8):
The backlash from Congressional Democrats and the blogosphere against President Obama's tax compromise is misplaced. It was Congressional Democrats who refused to vote on the Bush tax cuts before the November election, so as to promote their election chances.
And it was the Senate Democrats who failed to pass the law that would eliminate tax cuts for those earning over $250,000 and even $1 million per year. 
These Democrats boxed President Obama into a corner. In response, he cut a reasonable deal with Congressional Republicans that benefits the unemployed and middle-class wage-earners. That is much more than the Congressional Democrats accomplished.
In turn, the blogosphere's response has been hysterical, characterizing President Obama as weak and unwilling to fight. This ignores recent history. President Obama displayed his strength in obtaining the stimulus, in the successful automobile bailout and in his patience with Congress as it plodded through health care.
These achievements are directly attributable to the president's ability to identify and remedy our nation's problems. Yet those in the blogosphere would seemingly prefer for the president to make them feel good by calling Republicans names.
I, for one, am happy with a president who is seemingly the last adult in the room.
Christopher J. Pagan Cincinnati, Dec. 8, 2010
To the Editor:
President Obama defended his tax compromise by arguing that the Republicans were holding the American people hostage and he didn't want the people to be harmed.
The reason you don't negotiate with hostage-takers is not that your heart is cold to the plight of the hostages. It is that if you do, the hostage-takers will inevitably be encouraged to take more hostages.
Wait and see, Mr. Obama.
Ron Bonn San Diego, Dec. 8, 2010
To the Editor:
In your Dec. 7 editorial ''The Tax Cut Endgame,'' you criticize President Obama for striking a deal with the Republicans to extend tax cuts and unemployment benefits. You worry that tax cuts for the rich are not affordable and claim that Mr. Obama should have made that case now rather than wait for two years or so. I think you are mistaken on both counts.
The American economy still has a long way to go before it has recovered from the recent recession. So keeping taxes low for the middle class is imperative for now. If the cost of doing so in the face of Republican intransigence is low taxes for the wealthy for a few years, it is a cost well worth paying.
In two or three years -- when, one hopes, the economy is much closer to full strength -- Mr. Obama (or his successor) won't have to make the case that these tax cuts are too expensive to continue. He can simply let all the Bush tax cuts expire.
Eric S. Maskin Princeton, N.J., Dec. 7, 2010
The writer, a 2007 Nobel laureate in economics, is a professor of social science at the Institute for Advanced Study.
To the Editor:
Did anyone in the Obama administration even talk to those of us in the middle class? I want to let the tax cuts expire rather than keep them for people earning more than $250,000.
I make a little more than $47,000 a year as a tenured community college teacher. My salary and cost-of-living increases have been frozen for the last two years.
Please, let my taxes go up! Then put the blame squarely where it belongs: on the Republicans, who claim to support fiscal responsibility but are doing all they can to bankrupt our country.

HEADLINE: Why C.E.O.'s Should Stop At City Hall

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
This past Wednesday, Jim Gray, a wealthy construction executive from Lexington, Ky., flew to New York City for a whirlwind round of meetings. Mr. Gray, 57, is the chief executive of Gray Construction, a family-owned business that builds large industrial facilities for the likes of Toyota, Siemens, Caterpillar and other giant manufacturers. It has around $500 million in annual revenue.
In addition to running a successful company, Mr. Gray is Lexington's new mayor-elect, and it was in that capacity that he had come to New York. Although he had filled his day with various appointments, the real reason he was here was that Michael R. Bloomberg, New York's billionaire mayor, had agreed to grant him an audience. Thus one wealthy-businessman-turned-mayor was hoping to learn from another wealthy-businessman-turned-mayor, a little like a rookie learning from a wily veteran. 
''I want to see what his org chart looks like,'' Mr. Gray told me a few hours before the meeting, using business shorthand for organizational structure. ''I want to see the systems he uses for tracking performance.'' At Gray Construction, Mr. Gray and his brothers long ago instituted an ''open office'' concept, where everyone, from assistants to the chief executive, sat in one large, open room. That was the same model Mr. Bloomberg adopted when he got to city hall, and Mr. Gray couldn't wait to see it. His excitement was palpable.
By happy coincidence, Wednesday was a big day for Mr. Bloomberg as well. That morning, the mayor made a major speech at the Brooklyn Navy Yard -- a speech that promoted what Mr. Bloomberg described as New York's economic successes, and contrasted those successes with the failings of the federal government to revive the country's economy.
''The economic policies that we have pursued to drive this growth have been neither left nor right, liberal nor conservative,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. He criticized both Democrats and Republicans in Washington for putting ideological purity over pragmatism -- in effect, for not acting more like him. He laid out an agenda -- lower business taxes, ''smarter'' regulation, immigration reform, job-training programs, promotion of innovation -- that, he said, would help put people back to work. What the country needs, according to Mr. Bloomberg, is ''centrist solutions to our toughest economic problems.''
It was the kind of speech that politicians often make when they are laying the groundwork for a run at higher office. Back during the early stages of the last presidential campaign, there were rumblings that Mr. Bloomberg might throw his hat in the ring. After his speech on Wednesday, there was similar talk, which Mr. Bloomberg and his top aides were quick to dampen. The reason for his speech, they insisted, was that the mayor had become frustrated at Washington's inability to help get the country back on its feet. His immense wealth and prominence gave him a bully pulpit -- and this seemed like the right time to use it.
What I wound up wondering about, though, was whether Mr. Bloomberg's centrist, business-oriented approach could even work at the federal level. Or whether successful businessmen like him -- and Mr. Gray -- are, instead, ideally suited for only one job in politics. Namely, the job they have.
Mayors make miserable ideologues, and ideologues make miserable mayors. Though the story may be apocryphal, they say that during the Vietnam War, Richard J. Daley, the legendary mayor of Chicago, found himself seated at some event next to John V. Lindsay, who was then New York's mayor. Lindsay had become increasingly critical of America's involvement in the war. Daley leaned over to Lindsay and said, ''Your job is to pick up the garbage.''
And so it is. It is also to oversee the police, fire and school departments, and to make sure the potholes are filled, the snow is removed and the budget is balanced. An energetic mayor can create jobs far more directly than the federal government -- by helping lure new industry to town, or giving companies tax breaks to help them expand. He or she can push for new development -- and then, with any luck, preside over the ribbon-cutting when the development is complete. It is probably the most hands-on job you can have in government, and the one where you can most easily see the fruits of your labor.
Which is also why it appeals to businessmen like Mr. Gray and Mr. Bloomberg. It is a job that lends itself to the pragmatic cast of mind that allowed them to become successful in the first place. Take Mr. Gray, for instance. He was 19 when his father, who had founded Gray Construction after World War II, died of lung cancer in 1972. The company that Mr. Gray, his brothers and his mother inherited was small, with maybe $1 million in revenue, and the Grays floundered at first. (Mr. Gray came on full time when he graduated from college.) They righted the ship and set it on a new course, by shifting gears -- pragmatically -- taking advantage of a new trend in business.
They saw that Japanese companies had not only begun to compete successfully with their American counterparts, but were beginning to build factories in the United States. In 1979, Gray Construction built a Toshiba factory in Tennessee, but the company's real break came in the mid-1980s, when it was one of four companies hired by Toyota to build its first auto plant in America. Since then, Gray Construction has been one of the dominant companies in building factories for foreign automakers in the United States.
Jim Gray pushed for his company to go to an open office after he saw the concept in Japan. (''It's a competitive advantage,'' he said. ''It lowers the palace intrigue and allows everyone to know what is going on.'') And in shifting the company to this new customer base, Mr. Gray and his brothers learned a great deal about the importance of giving the customer what he wants.
''Half of our work now is with foreign companies,'' said Stephen Gray, Jim's younger brother, who will become chief executive when Mr. Gray moves into Lexington's city hall. ''The last thing they want to hear is, 'This is the way we do it here.' You have to listen, listen and then listen some more. It requires an extreme amount of patience,'' Stephen Gray added. ''But they are the customer.''
The election last month was Jim Gray's second run for mayor. The first time, a few years back, he lost. He was losing this time, too, until he hired a political consultant who turned the campaign around in part by stressing Mr. Gray's business acumen.
''A city is a business,'' said the consultant, Doc Sweitzer, who, as the co-founder of the Campaign Group, has managed a number of mayoral campaigns. ''I wanted to show that Jim's business skills and management abilities would result in better services and a better bottom line for the city.'' With Lexington facing the prospect of a $25 million budget shortfall -- around 8 percent of the budget -- that is precisely what voters wanted to hear. It turns out that voters are pretty nonideological when they are casting their ballots for mayor.
For his part, Mr. Bloomberg has been nothing if not a customer-focused mayor, striving for efficiencies at every turn. He has combined agencies when he thought that made sense. He put GPS systems in ambulances and in garbage trucks so that the city could track them -- and figure out whether the job could be done just as well or better with fewer of them. He had managed to reduce the number of police officers without causing crime to go up. Fire fatalities are down -- even though there are fewer firefighters.
And he measures everything, obsessively. He installed something called the Citywide Performance Reporting dashboard, an online database that allowed him -- and everyone else in city hall -- to monitor the city's various agencies. In that open city hall bullpen where he and his top aides sit, a large flat-screen TV looms overhead, flashing statistics showing real-time performance in areas that Mr. Bloomberg tracks. ''One of the key things we showed is that governments should be measured by their results and not how much they spend,'' said Edward Skyler, a former deputy mayor who is now an executive at Citigroup.
People who know Mr. Bloomberg well say that his management style has changed since he moved from Bloomberg, the company he built, to the mayor's office. He's become more willing to delegate, and understands that it takes much longer to get anything done in government than it does in business. He's also been lucky in that he has a weak City Council, and has largely been able to do what he wants, with little serious opposition.
Is Mr. Bloomberg's record perfect? Of course not. Early on, he agreed to union contracts that will swell the cost of pensions. He does not accept criticism easily. And his willingness to shove the city's term limits overboard so that he could run for a third term was nothing if not an act of hubris -- a trait he shares with many successful chief executives. Still, few would argue that New York has not improved in the time he has been mayor.
What you hear, if you put your ear to the ground, is that Mr. Bloomberg really believes he would be a good president -- and that the main reason he is saying he won't run is because everyone around him keeps telling him he can't win. They're almost surely right: however much Americans like pragmatic, business-oriented mayors, they also want presidents with a clear-cut ideology. Senators and congressmen would not roll over like the New York City Council, especially not to a centrist who commanded no loyalty from either party. In the end, Mr. Bloomberg's approach can fix a city much more readily than it can fix a country.
None of which bothers Jim Gray a whit. After he returned to Lexington, I called to ask how the visit had gone. Very well, he replied; they discussed a range of topics, like how to attract jobs, how to hire department heads and how instill confidence in a city. Mr. Gray had enjoyed watching Mr. Bloomberg hold sway in the city hall bullpen. ''It was inspiring,'' he said.
Next month, when Mr. Gray takes office, it will be the rookie's turn to show that he's learned the veteran's secrets.

HEADLINE: Navigating the Deals, Then Trails

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
GOOD news for skiers and snowboarders: ski resorts are rolling out some aggressive deals this season, and if you know where to look, you can cut the cost of a winter vacation by as much as 40 percent.
Travelocity.com, for instance, has hotel packages to Colorado and Canada for up to 30 percent off, with a $100 credit on top of those savings to travelers who book three-night vacations. Ski.com reports that bargains are even more plentiful than last season, and is offering budget-conscious travelers a wider choice, from Vermont to California. And Expedia.com has so many ski packages this season that it plans to extend its Ski Sale, which offers savings of up to 40 percent, through January.
It's a strategy that worked a year ago when resorts were faced with lower precipitation and a slumping economy. Despite those setbacks, hefty price cuts were responsible in part for resorts having their second-best season ever, with visits that totaled nearly 60 million, according to a survey by the National Ski Areas Association. 
This season the industry is hoping for a repeat.
''It is once again a skier's market,'' said Dan Sherman, director of marketing for Ski.com. While the offers are very similar to last season's with free nights, free lift tickets and free upgrades rather than outright discounts, there are more of them, he said. ''We have more for January, more for spring break, and even more for the December holidays than in recent memory.''
Holiday Savings (But Book Now) A recent search on Ski.com pulled up 99 deals over the New Year's holiday alone, including a seven-night vacation for four people staying in a two-bedroom condominium in Snowmass, Colo., for $1,375 a person, with lift tickets. That's a saving of roughly 25 percent. A five-night trip for four over Christmas and New Year's was $1,296 a person in a two-bedroom in Steamboat Springs, Colo. -- a total saving of $2,427.
Availability over the holiday week is rare and discounts are practically unheard of, but travel agents say skiers still have some options if they move quickly. ''I am seeing unbelievable rates for the Christmas holiday week in Beaver Creek and Jackson Hole,'' said Marrilee Foukal McLean, a Virtuoso travel agent in Montgomery, Ala. While many of the prime condominiums are nearly full this late in the game, she pointed to hotels like the Pines Lodge, a RockResort in Beaver Creek, Colo., which normally go for $215 at this time of year but have been offering rates as low as $160 in December.
''I am not sure why this is happening,'' Ms. McLean said. ''Could be that people assume the rates are out the roof and that they have waited too late, but they will find that they are wrong.''
Help From Hotels On Airfares Finding low airfares can be tricky, with carriers continuing to keep a tight rein on capacity in order to fill every last seat. But some resorts are picking up a portion of the ticket price to woo skiers and snowboarders. For trips between Dec. 16 and April 3, Crested Butte Mountain Resort in Colorado is offering an airfare credit of up to $400 a ticket for every third person staying at least four nights with a Friends and Family Fly Free promotion. Jackson Hole, Wyo. has a similar deal for every fourth airline ticket, up to $500. The promotion is limited to eight people per party and travelers must book by Jan. 31 and stay a minimum of five nights.
Another option for cutting airfare: Consider hub airports in cities like Denver and Salt Lake City where there are generally more flights to choose from and costs can be lower. From Denver, for example, you can drive to Keystone in about an hour and a half or Vail in about two hours. And visitors to Salt Lake have 11 resorts to choose from within a one-hour drive.
When Kids Stay, Or Ski, Free For families, there is no excuse for paying full price this season, as practically every resort is offering its own twist to children skiing, staying or renting free. For the second season in a row, Aspen/Snowmass has a Kids Ski and Stay Free deal when adults buy lodging and lift tickets for five nights or more. This year the offer has been extended to March and April for stays booked several weeks ahead. Reserve a four-night stay by Dec. 17 for trips Jan. 1 to Feb. 10 and get a fifth night free with the Perfect Storm package. (Book by Jan. 14 for stays from Feb. 11 to April 3.)
Sunday River in Newry, Me., offers free tickets, lessons, rentals, lodging and discounted day care for children with a three-night stay or more during the Children's Festival, which runs Jan. 9 to 14. And The Lodges at Deer Valley in Park City, Utah, has two free lift tickets for children for every two adult lift tickets.
Most ski resorts offer such deals for children 12 and under. But Mount Bachelor in Bend, Ore., extends its Kids Ski/Ride free deal to 18-year-olds. Buy an adult three out of five, or five out of seven, multi-day ticket, and receive one ticket for your accompanying child free.
Travel Agents Often Know Best Many of these sales are based on availability, allowing resorts to end discounts once sales begin to pick back up, so act quickly for the best rates.
Using a skilled travel agent can also pay off. Virtuoso, a major travel agent network, has a Double Dipping Deal that bundles one of Jackson Hole's several offers, like Ski4 Free at the Snake River Lodge (four nights' lodging and two three-day lift tickets) with a special amenities offer such as a bottle of wine, room upgrade or a $100 resort gift card.
Ms. McLean, the agent from Montgomery, knows how to work the system. She recently booked a family of 27 going to Crested Butte over the peak holiday week in several different groups instead of one reservation in order to take advantage of the resort's free airfare deal for every third person. That move enabled her to work around the fine print, which limits the deal to three free airline tickets per reservation. In the end she secured 10 free plane tickets for the family.
''All it took was just a little more paperwork,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Organ Donation: Let the Market Rule?

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER. 
E-mail: citycritic@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A year and a half ago, Angelica Nieves was doing fine, working as a housekeeper in a hotel and living on her own in Brooklyn. When she started experiencing a shortness of breath, her doctor said it was asthma.
Soon, she couldn't keep food down. Turns out it was congestive heart failure, the disease that had killed her mother when Ms. Nieves was a young girl. At 29, she recalled, ''I thought my life was over. I was actually making arrangements for my funeral with my family.''
After three months at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital, Ms. Nieves was released, with a machine in her chest to keep her blood flowing and a spot on the list for a heart transplant. 
In New York City, on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley, there are 7,800 people on similar lists, all hoping for the heart or liver or kidney that could save their lives. Last year, 682 people received organs. Some of the others went on to wait another year. Hundreds died.
To try to improve those numbers, New York City is starting a pilot programin which, for the next five months, an organ-recovery team will trail ambulances responding to 911 calls, ready to leap in if the patient dies and is a viable donor. It's a bold experiment: no other American city has even tried it. Yet officials have already warned that the program, financed with a $1.5 million grant, might not yield a single kidney.
Organ transplantation sometimes seems to defy the laws of supply and demand: thousands of New York bodies need organs they don't have, and thousands more have organs that, because of an untimely demise, they no longer need. But the path between those two groups crisscrosses people's religious beliefs, their feelings about death and bodily integrity and their ability to make their wishes known to their next of kin.
For some, it's a simple choice: when they die, they would like their organs to be used to save someone else's life. But New York State doesn't make it easy. People can sign up when they renew their drivers' licenses, though that's only once a decade, or they can go online and fill out an off-putting form, then print it out and walk it to a mailbox.
A mailbox?
The New York Organ Donor Network has decided it's not even worth rolling out its new education campaign until the state makes it easier for people to sign up. People on the waiting list, meanwhile, keep dying.
Some other countries take a more proactive approach: they regard everyone as a potential donor. If you don't want anyone shopping your kidney around when you die, you have to say so in advance. The burden, that is, falls on those who opt out of the system, rather than those who opt in.
Something like that would do a lot to save American lives.
And it would never happen here. Can you imagine how it would play on the evening news? The government cutting open defenseless people and stealing their tender parts.
Some economists have suggested adjusting the supply-and-demand problem through market incentives. Instead of asking people to donate their organs, why not just pay for them? The suggestion seems to outrage many people, who perhaps picture greedy zillionaires carving up poor working stiffs with a diamond-encrusted scalpel. But what if it worked like this: while you're healthy, you volunteer your kidneys. Then when you die, and the kidneys are removed, your family would be compensated for your funeral expenses. That doesn't seem quite so outrageous, does it?
Gary Becker, the Nobel laureate who teaches economics at the University of Chicago, has proposed something even more radical: paying people to part with their organs now, while they are still using them. You've got two kidneys but you can get by with one. You've got only one liver but you don't really need that meaty chunk at the end. How does $30,000 sound?
In an interview, he said the idea should not be that shocking. As long as exchanges were carefully regulated, no one would be forced into it. It would solve an otherwise intractable problem. And unlike the current system, in which friends and relatives are often guilted into becoming donors, a market-based approach would compensate families fairly for their discomfort and risk.
Elaine Berg, president of the New York Organ Donor Network, cites a very different kind of incentive. When people arrange for their dying family members to become organ donors, she said, ''it helps them through the grief process, and it's the final thing they can do for their relatives.''
I'm a member of one of those donor families. When my Aunt Sandy died 12 years ago, her organs went on to save three people's lives. I can't say it lessened the experience of her loss one little bit, but it did extend the generosity she had always shown.
I'm also in a recipient family. My more-or-less cousin Matt has been on and off the waiting list for a new heart for years. He doesn't condone paying for organs. ''Just doesn't pass the smell test,'' he says. A few years ago, Matt got the phone call he had been waiting for, which (along with his supportive family, he made me promise to add) saved his life. At age 37, he got a new heart. Counting the one he was born with, it is his fourth.
As for Angelica Nieves, she is still waiting for that call. Machines like the one that's keeping her alive tend to last about two years, of which 14 months have already passed.
''There's days I wake up crying, 'What if I don't get a heart?' I go to sleep crying,'' she admitted. ''But every day that goes by I thank God I made it another day.'' What else can she do?

 BODY:
Fiction
FREEDOM By Jonathan Franzen. Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $28.
The author of ''The Corrections'' is back, not quite a decade later, with an even richer and deeper work -- a vividly realized narrative set during the Bush years, when the creedal legacy of ''personal liberties'' assumed new and sometimes ominous proportions. Franzen captures this through the tribulations of a Midwestern family, the Berglunds, whose successes, failures and appetite for self-invention reflect the larger story of millennial America.
THE NEW YORKER STORIES By Ann Beattie. Scribner, $30. 
As these 48 stories published in The New Yorker from 1974 through 2006 demonstrate, Beattie, even as she chronicled and satirized her post-1960s generation, also became its defining voice. She punctures her characters' pretensions and jadedness with an economy and effortless dialogue that writers have been trying to emulate for three decades, though few, if any, have matched her seamless combination of biting wit and mordant humor, precise irony and consummate cool.
ROOM By Emma Donoghue. Little, Brown & Company, $24.99.
Donoghue has created one of the pure triumphs of recent fiction: an ebullient child narrator, held captive with his mother in an 11-by-11-foot room, through whom we encounter the blurry, often complicated space between closeness and autonomy. In a narrative at once delicate and vigorous -- rich in psychological, sociological and political meaning -- Donoghue reveals how joy and terror often dwell side by side.
SELECTED STORIES By William Trevor. Viking, $35.
Gathering work from Trevor's previous four collections, this volume shows why his deceptively spare fiction has haunted and moved readers for generations. Set mainly in Ireland and England, Trevor's tales are eloquent even in their silences, documenting the way the present is consumed by the past, the way ancient patterns shape the future. Neither modernist nor antique, his stories are timeless.
A VISIT FROM THE GOON SQUAD By Jennifer Egan. Alfred A. Knopf, $25.95.
Time is the ''goon squad'' in this virtuosic rock 'n' roll novel about a cynical record producer and the people who intersect his world. Ranging across some 40 years and inhabiting 13 different characters, each with his own story and perspective, Egan makes these disparate parts cohere into an artful whole, irradiated by a Proustian feel for loss, regret and the ravages of love.
Nonfiction
APOLLO'S ANGELS: A History of Ballet By Jennifer Homans. Random House, $35.
Here is the only truly definitive history of classical ballet. Spanning more than four centuries, from the French Renaissance to American and Soviet stages during the cold war, Homans shows how the art has been central to the social and cultural identity of nations. She meticulously reconstructs entire eras, describing the evolution of ballet technique while coaxing long-lost dances back to life. And she raises a crucial question: In the 21st century, can ballet survive?
CLEOPATRA: A Life By Stacy Schiff. Little, Brown & Company, $29.99.
With her signature blend of wit, intelligence and superb prose, Schiff strips away 2,000 years of prejudices and propaganda in her elegant reimagining of the Egyptian queen who, even in her own day, was mythologized and misrepresented.
THE EMPEROR OF ALL MALADIES: A Biography of Cancer By Siddhartha Mukherjee. Scribner, $30.
Mukherjee's magisterial ''biography'' of the most dreaded of modern afflictions. He excavates the deep history of the ''war'' on cancer, weaving haunting tales of his own clinical experience with sharp sketches of the sometimes heroic, sometimes misguided scientists who have preceded him in the fight.
FINISHING THE HAT: Collected Lyrics (1954-1981) With Attendant Comments, Principles, Heresies, Grudges, Whines and Anecdotes By Stephen Sondheim. Alfred A. Knopf, $39.95.
The theater's pre-eminent living songwriter offers a master class in how to write a musical, covering some of the greatest shows, from ''West Side Story'' to ''Sweeney Todd.'' Sondheim's analysis of his and others' lyrics is insightful and candid, and his anecdotes are telling and often very funny.
THE WARMTH OF OTHER SUNS: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration By Isabel Wilkerson. Random House, $30.
Wilkerson, a former national correspondent for The Times, has written a masterly and engrossing account of the Great Migration, in which six million African-Americans abandoned the South between 1915 and 1970. The book centers on the journeys of three black migrants, each representing a different decade and a different destination.

THE MASTER SWITCH
The Rise and Fall of Information Empires
By Tim Wu
366 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.95
Shortly after the United States developed the first atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer realized the country would need a new kind of weapons laboratory. This lab would maintain and improve the military's arsenal rather than create new weapons. It would be called Sandia National Laboratories and placed not far from Los Alamos.
Initially, the University of California ran the lab, but President Truman soon decided to transfer its operation to the entity he thought could best run it during the nascent cold war: AT&T. ''In my opinion,'' Truman wrote to an AT&T subsidiary in 1949, ''you have here an opportunity to render an exceptional service in the national interest.'' AT&T ended up running Sandia until the early 1990s. 
It was one of the more extraordinary instances of Ma Bell's involvement with Uncle Sam. The company owed its very existence to a favorable federal patent ruling in 1878, which saved it from an early death at the hands of Western Union, the dominant telegraph company then trying to crush its new rival. A little more than a century later, Washington broke up AT&T. But regulators soon allowed many of the company's parts to merge back together. This consolidation, Tim Wu argues in ''The Master Switch,'' probably allowed the Bush administration to conduct its wiretapping program in secret for so long.
AT&T is the star of Wu's book, an intellectually ambitious history of modern communications. The organizing principle -- only rarely overdrawn -- is what Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School, calls ''the cycle.'' ''History shows a typical progression of information technologies,'' he writes, ''from somebody's hobby to somebody's industry; from jury-rigged contraption to slick production marvel; from a freely accessible channel to one strictly controlled by a single corporation or cartel -- from open to closed system.'' Eventually, entrepreneurs or regulators smash apart the closed system, and the cycle begins anew.
The story covers the history of phones, radio, television, movies and, finally, the Internet. All of these businesses are susceptible to the cycle because all depend on networks, whether they're composed of cables in the ground or movie theaters around the country. Once a company starts building such a network or gaining control over one, it begins slouching toward monopoly. If the government is not already deeply involved in the business by then (and it usually is), it soon will be.
Wu argues that it has little choice. Not only are communications businesses particularly prone to consolidation, but the political effects are far greater than they would be in other industries. The book's title comes from a line by Fred Friendly, the longtime CBS News executive, in which he distinguished between free-speech laws and ''exclusive custody of the master switch.'' They are two different things, but either has the ability to shape the flow of information. The same cannot be said, Wu notes, ''of orange juice, heating oil, running shoes or dozens of other industries, no matter their size.''
Today may seem an odd time to be making this argument, given the online flowering of discourse, civil and otherwise. But Wu makes a good case that the Internet is vulnerable to the cycle. The world's computer network is ultimately a physical entity, onto which other forms of communication -- film, telephone, television, radio -- are starting to migrate. This is what media executives mean by ''convergence.'' It seems likely to help big companies get even bigger, and arguably offers the potential for even tighter control of information than existed in the past.
Wu's candidates for the AT&T of the future are Comcast (if its takeover of NBC-Universal succeeds), Google (if it decides to abandon its tradition of openness and instead tries to eliminate rivals) and some combination of AT&T itself and Apple. But he ponders this only briefly and acknowledges that it is too early to know. His most thought-provoking argument about the future may actually be the past.
The similarities between radio and the Internet are particularly striking. Radio in the early 20th century was a scattering of amateur stations, started not for profit, but so its hobbyists would have a platform for their views and interests. Lee De Forest, a pioneer who ran a station in the Bronx, urged young people to listen so that in ''the still night hours'' they could ''welcome friendly visitors from the whole wide world.'' Waldemar Kaempffert, the editor of Scientific American, proclaimed, ''All these disconnected communities and houses will be united through radio as they were never united by the telegraph and telephone.''
Soon, however, radio's heterogeneity began to fade. In 1922, WEAF in New York, AT&T's flagship station, broadcast the first advertisement, for a leafy housing development in Queens. By 1926, AT&T had teamed up with the Radio Corporation of America to form a new radio network, the National Broadcasting Company. The station, at 660 AM, would become known as WNBC (and later as WFAN, the country's first radio station devoted to sports).
AT&T and the radio manufacturers wanted radio to transform from hobby to big business, so they decided to fight back, publicly and in the courts, against a commerce secretary who had been protecting radio from what he called ''advertising chatter.'' That commerce secretary was Herbert Hoover. A federal court eventually ruled that Hoover had no authority to assign radio frequencies, and NBC's network mushroomed. The cycle was under way.
Wu wisely avoids magic-bullet solutions to the inevitable problems of the communications industry. Simply keeping government out of the business does not work, because the industry tends to form private monopolies if left alone. And having the government run the business, as England and other countries have tried, presents its own problems. The government itself is a monopolist and often behaves like one. Wu instead calls for constraining ''all power that derives from the control of information.'' He writes, ''If we believe in liberty, it must be freedom from both private and public coercion.''
In practice, this would mean that the Justice Department would have to adopt a broader definition of its antitrust powers, beyond its typical emphasis on competition's effect on prices. The longstanding Hollywood censorship code did not raise ticket prices, after all, but it did violate the country's ideals. Similarly, AT&T had the power to quash the answering machine, which, incredibly, a Bell Labs engineer invented in 1934. The ''government's only proper role,'' Wu concludes, ''is as a check on private power, never as an aid to it.'' It is a useful rule of thumb, even if not every choice breaks down quite so clearly.
Wu previously popularized the phrase ''net neutrality,'' an updated version of the old notion of ''common carriage'' in the telephone industry. The central idea, as with that of this book, is that market competition brings enormous benefits, but the market itself does not ensure competition -- or, more broadly, desirable outcomes.
This argument can be extended to the economic importance of communications, even if Wu's concern is more political. The businesses he describes have been some of the American economy's great global successes: Google, NBC, Paramount Pictures and many others. They were able to lead the way in part because they could take advantage of the fruits of this country's long tradition -- now somewhat diminished -- of government investment in basic scientific research that the private sector would never find profitable.
The Internet, to take one example, may now be the world's communications network. But it started as a Defense Department project. As ''The Master Switch'' artfully shows, the government often has a role that no company will play on its own.

HEADLINE: Jobless Aides Comb The Democratic Market

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Seemingly desperate times call for desperate measures, which explains why Jonathan Lipman found himself sitting in a hospital room in early November, his day-old son resting on his shoulder, thumbing his BlackBerry searching for a new job on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Lipman, 33, was the communications director for Representative Melissa Bean, Democrat of Illinois, whose election results from the previous week were still too close to call. But knowing the vote count was not likely to fall her way (it did not) and with a second child to support, Mr. Lipman e-mailed the chief of staff for Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, about a potential opening in her press office. 
He met with Ms. Shaheen and her top aides the day after his own boss conceded, and he started his new job as her communications director on Monday.
Mr. Lipman is one of several success stories -- a Democrat, newly out of work after the midterm elections, who has found a solid landing pad on Capitol Hill.
But for many others in the Democratic diaspora, whose bosses retired or were voted out of office, the search for employment furiously continues, as networking and job hunting merge into something of a second job. The mood, meanwhile, ranges from distressed to upbeat.
''I like to say I'm a full-time Congressional communications director, a full-time job seeker and a full-time mom,'' said Hillary Wicai Viers, the communications director for Representative Charlie Wilson, an Ohio Democrat who lost his re-election bid. Informal job e-mail lists are popping up. Speaker Nancy Pelosi's chief of staff, John Lawrence, sent an e-mail to a broad range of Democratic House aides offering Ms. Pelosi and her staff as ''a resource'' to, among other things, alert job seekers to Congressional offices wanting help. All manner of career fairs are de rigueur.
The Democratic Communicators Network, a group that helps legislators forge connections , put together a job fair on the Monday before Thanksgiving, bringing in political communications firms, off-the-Hill groups and even someone from the White House personnel office, who offered resume tips.
On Wednesday, the Center for Association Leadership sponsored a panel about ''career opportunities in the association world'' that tried to tailor its message to Congressional staff members. ''If you're wondering what's next after such an amazing experience, you're not alone,'' said Christopher Krese, a senior vice president at the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, who once worked on Capitol Hill as a press secretary.
Mr. Krese paid homage to the things that he said he had missed ''horribly'' at first -- near-constant political banter, colleagues tossing a Nerf football in the halls at day's end, group excursions after work to a Tex-Mex restaurant. But he also said, ''Working in an association feels a lot like being a Congressional staffer.''
Scott Schloegel, the chief of staff to Representative Bart Stupak, a Michigan Democrat who is retiring, has already found a job with the government's Export-Import Bank. But he said that when he recently had lunch with a friend -- an out-of-work Democrat -- the friend insisted on bringing rice and beans from home and heating his meal in the office microwave. (''He said he couldn't afford to spend money'' in the House cafeteria, Mr. Schloegel explained.)
''For some people, it's the first time they've been out in the job market for a long time, and there's obviously some anxiety that goes along with that,'' said Jennifer Crider, the deputy executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, whose office has fielded ''a lot of inquiries'' from Democrats looking for work.
. Networking and after-work drinking are unofficial pastimes of Congressional staff members, and they have taken on a decidedly jobs-oriented accent.
Several Democratic aides e-mailed an invitation for a ''Losers are winners, too!'' gathering, where the price of admission was a resume. ''We losers-winners merely hope to winnow the resume pool a bit and help us all stay connected after the final cubicle is packed and the last BlackBerry relinquished,'' the invitation said.
And the place to see and be seen, with resume in tow? ''In the hallways, in every coffee shop in D.C., with every phone call, with every meeting,'' Ms. Viers said. ''Where isn't networking taking place? Literally, every phone call I would take, whether it was a vendor or a friend of a friend, I'd say, 'Hey, can I shoot you my resume?' and everybody I know is doing the same thing.''
Ms. Viers's perseverance paid off, and she has been hired for a job that she would describe only as working for an agency in the Obama administration. Her future employer, she said, ''got my resume twice in the same day.''
''Let's just say I've been networking a lot,'' she added.
The cafeteria in the Longworth Building, one of the House office buildings, has also become a hub for occupational speed dating.
''It's crazy down there,'' Mr. Lipman said. ''You go in for a meeting and you look around, and everybody you know is meeting with everyone else. You look at two people having a meeting, and you think, 'Of those two people, I met with one of them yesterday, and I'm meeting with the other tomorrow.' ''
He added, ''It's not terribly different from trying to get a bill passed -- other than you're the bill.''
When staff members are not networking themselves, they are helping their unemployed colleagues. Those who have landed new jobs are using their contacts to promote their friends. One of Mr. Schloegel's friends jokingly refers to him as ''my agent.''
''In some ways, my job search hasn't stopped,'' Mr. Schloegel said. ''I'm just doing it for other people now.''

HEADLINE: Smarter Sensors for Tire Monitors

BYLINE: By STEPHEN WILLIAMS

 BODY:
LIFE is not easy for tires. Beyond the injuries meted out by potholes and the stress imposed by drivers who insist on squealing through curves, there is the indignity of underinflation.
Tires with insufficient air pressure -- a typical sign of owner indifference -- not only reduce a car's fuel economy and wear out faster, they are also at risk for blowouts. According to the Transportation Department, more than a quarter of all cars on American roads have at least one tire that is seriously low on air.
Since 2007, the federal government has required some form of tire pressure monitoring as a standard safety feature on new vehicles, and a phase-in of the systems will begin in Europe in a couple of years. The requirement was stipulated by Congress in 2000 as part of the Tread Act (the acronym stands for Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation) following a swarm of rollover accidents and fatalities involving Firestone tires on Ford Explorers and similar trucks. 
The adoption of pressure monitors has not been trouble-free, with false warnings a common irritant to drivers of new models. Carmakers and tire companies are working to advance the art of the sensor and its supporting electronics, making the system less susceptible to the effects of the environment and the perils of the road -- and making it more trustworthy for drivers.
The monitoring systems measure inflation either indirectly, using data from the vehicle's wheel-speed sensors, or directly, relying on pressure readings from a battery-powered sensor mounted on the inner surface of the wheel rim. The system relays an alert, using a radio-frequency signal, to flash a warning light or digital readout on the dashboard when air pressure is low. The systems are set to alert the driver when a tire's pressure falls 25 percent or more below the carmaker's recommended inflation level.
Engineers trying to establish a threshold for the warnings encounter some vexing challenges.
''It's a matter of physics,'' said Ward Randall, sales manager of body and security products for Continental, the tire maker and electronics supplier. ''Tire pressure is a function of temperature, and when the temperature varies, the pressure will vary.''
Some alarms are not false alarms, said Mike Wischhusen, director for industry standards at Michelin North America, ''Once the tire warms up, the alarm will go away -- usually,'' he said.
Besides the occasional glitchy reading, there are other annoyances related to the systems. Most sensors are tailored to specific vehicles, though universal models are being developed. For manufacturers, Mr. Wischhusen said, the sensor is another part number in inventory, another piece to be damaged in the mounting process. ''And that's aggravating for the consumer as well,'' he said.
If the wheels are changed, the sensors must be removed from the old wheels and transferred to the new ones, or new sensors must be purchased. Because the sensors are paired to accelerometers -- so that the battery drain is minimal when the car is parked -- battery life is long, but they do die after seven to 10 years.
Continental's solution, still two or three years away, involves putting the sensor on the inner surface of the tire instead of on the wheel. It is part of what the company calls the I.T.S., for intelligent tire monitoring system.
In this design, the tire sensor would also communicate with the car's control computer and could govern the vehicle's top speed until the tire reaches a proper temperature and pressure level. ''There's been a lot of debate about whether people really care about this stuff,'' Mr. Randall said. ''Because of the I.T.S., because of enhanced data, we will be able to provide the vehicle with more information. If we're talking about improving handling and drivability, this is something the driver can perceive.''
Besides performance enhancements, other automotive economies enter into the equation, he said. The sensors used in the I.T.S. are cheaper and more accurate than current models, strong attractions for carmakers.
Continental also proposes a so-called ready sensor, which Mr. Randall refers to as a filling assistant, that could tell the vehicle's computer which tire needs air and would alert the person with the air hose when the correct pressure has been reached by honking the car's horn. Smartphone applications to read pressure and other tire data using a more sophisticated sensor are in the offing as well.
Mr. Wischhusen of Michelin is less specific about his company's plans. ''When it makes sense to put that kind of technology in the tire, we'll do it,'' he said. ''The shift will move in that direction, but it doesn't happen overnight.''
Michelin, he said, makes tires, not integrated circuits. ''So we're watching what the suppliers can do -- a tire is not a hospitable environment for an integrated circuit, and now you've got to worry about the integrity of the tire.''

HEADLINE: Profit Potential Outweighs Risk in Juarez Factories

BYLINE: By JULIAN AGUILAR. 
jaguilar@texastribune.org

 BODY:
In 2009, more than $42 billion in trade value moved through the ports that Ciudad Juarez shares with El Paso, representing 15 percent of the total trade between the United States and Mexico. That number is estimated to be even higher in 2010.
Since June 2009, more than 24,000 manufacturing jobs have been added in Juarez, on the Texas-Mexico border, and the amount of tractor-trailer traffic hauling goods through the region increased by 22 percent from January to June of 2010 compared with the first six months of last year. 
At the same time, there were more than 2,600 killings in Juarez in 2009, the byproduct of a battle between the rival Sinaloa and Juarez drug cartels, and the city is on pace to exceed 3,000 homicides in 2010.
So much for the deadening economic impact of headline-making violence. The psychological impact, however, is something different.
While the killings and threats of extortion have forced thousands of retail businesses in Juarez to close and tens of thousands of residents to flee their homes for the safety of Texas, border business experts say the vibrancy of the city's manufacturing industry is due to what is and has always been the bottom line: money. Not even an unshakeable fear instilled in most of the 1.3 million Juarez residents can curb the success of the factories, or maquiladoras, where assembly-line workers earn, on average, $1.60 to $2 hourly.
''Juarez is open for business,'' said Toby M. Spoon, the executive vice president of Tecma, an outsourcing company based in El Paso that will celebrate 25 years in business next year.
A shelter operation that provides factory space, employees and legal expertise to businesses with a manufacturing presence in Mexico, Tecma had one of its best years in 2009, Mr. Spoon said. The company signed five new clients and netted an estimated $45 million in profits.
''I have discovered maybe an unsavory part of human nature: If we can make money, and it's not just too bad, then we are going to go for it,'' Mr. Spoon said.
Yet it is not business as usual in Juarez. The jobs added in the last year and a half are only a quarter of what was lost during the height of the recession, said Bob Cook, the president of the El Paso Regional Economic Development Corporation. But Mr. Cook echoed his fellow business leaders in arguing that drug-related violence posed no real threat to commerce.
The job loss ''is in the manufacturing and distribution side,'' Mr. Cook said. ''You absolutely see a complete tie-in with the economy and not with the violence.''
All of the development corporation's clients are concerned about the violence, Mr. Cook said, and all are conducting ''due diligence.'' Yet 15 companies have notified the corporation of their intent to expand or move their operations to Juarez since 2008. Only one potential newcomer opted out of setting up shop in the area, and two have chosen El Paso instead. The trend, Mr. Cook said, will help restore the region to prerecession levels, when more than 50,000 jobs in El Paso, in retail or manufacturing, were the result of Juarez's manufacturing industry.
Companies in the United States realized they had very thin inventories, ''and so producers began to arrive to Mexico's maquila plants very fast, and the well turned around very strongly,'' said Roberto Coronado, an economist in the El Paso branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. ''That happened in the summer of last year. The maquilas grew very strong in the first few months, and what we're seeing is that they're still growing but at a much slower pace.''
As of August, there were 338 maquiladoras in Juarez, up from 336 in December 2009.
The violence has had some effect on the way business leaders conduct their daily affairs. Mr. Spoon said he tried not to take the same route to Tecma's Juarez factories from one day to the next. Traveling in an armored vehicle or with an entourage, he said, would be too flashy and would only draw the attention of people who might wish him ill, so instead, he simply does not share his schedule with anyone, even his colleagues. If someone called Mr. Spoon's Juarez office and asked what time he would arrive for work, he said, the receptionist would be telling the truth if she said she did not know.
''The more fuzzy you can make the details, the better,'' he said.
The government-mandated aguinaldo -- the lump-sum savings deducted from maquila workers' paychecks and then distributed during the holiday season -- has also been affected. Mr. Spoon said there were discussions about disbursing the money quarterly after criminals were rumored to have threatened factory supervisors into handing over the savings or face retribution.
''It used to be given on a certain day -- now we don't announce it,'' he said of distributing the savings, which equal about 15 days of wages.
Despite the precautions, Tecma's employees have suffered the consequences of the chaos in Juarez. Some of their relatives have died, and others have been extorted. Mr. Cook and his colleagues at the development corporation have a 49-slide presentation, called ''Conducting Business in the Current Security Environment in Ciudad Juarez,'' that highlights the retail gains, commercial movement, real estate occupancy and migration issues, as well as the territories for which the cartels in Mexico are vying -- and killing one another.
''It's not our job to convince a company that it's safe to operate there,'' Mr. Cook said. ''Our job is to make sure that if a company is evaluating the potential of locating in the City of Juarez, they have all the information they need to make an informed decision.''
Inside the gates of the maquilas, the precautions, the analysis and the concerns are hidden from the majority of the factory workers -- if not forever, then at least for the duration of their shifts, said Blanca Estela Prieto, a supervisor at Portage Electronic Products.
''We live in a different world here,'' she said. ''The violence exists outside for us. I feel the fear when I leave, but inside, no.''

HEADLINE: Guarding a Planet's Air: Brazil

 BODY:
THE POLITICAL ISSUE What one country can do in the interests of all
RESOURCES AT PLAY Rain forests, wetlands, habitable areas, arable land; pharmaceuticals and minerals; the world's supply of oxygen 
Even as periodic international conferences fail to achieve consensus on how to address global warming, one modest success story points to a different path: a single nation, acting in the common interest, can accomplish a lot. Research analysts in Washington agree with State Department assessments that such progress is evident in Brazil.
The Amazon is Earth's largest oxygen-replenishing rain forest, a source of pharmaceuticals and strategic minerals that is rich in biodiversity. But well into the 1980s, deforestation, to exploit timber and expand farming, was proceeding at an alarming rate. Then Brazil's politics shifted enough to allow new environmental laws and policies. Even in a society with huge disparities of wealth and poverty, Brazil had advantages that gave it flexibility to act: a stable democracy, vigorous development, offshore oil resources, and no external enemies.
Since 2004, deforestation has slowed dramatically, and now global experts give Brazil's leaders high marks for environmental stewardship.
''Brazil is a major emerging economic powerhouse, which is going to give it all kinds of influence,'' said Sarah O. Ladislaw at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''It is producing more food, but using less acreage. It wraps managing natural resources into the elements of managing the country.''

HEADLINE: Latest Data From China Raises Fears Of Inflation

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- The booming Chinese economy is showing signs of overheating, according to a raft of new data, and that could spell trouble for this nation's growth early next year.
On Saturday, the government said China's consumer price index -- its broadest gauge of inflation -- rose 5.1 percent in November, the biggest jump in 28 months. Food prices soared and retail sales and property construction both rose sharply, as well.
A few days earlier, the government released trade data showing that imports and exports had jumped far more than expected in November. This is happening even as the country's two leading trade partners -- the European Union and the United States -- struggle with concerns over mounting debt and slower growth. 
Analysts say the new data is likely to put more pressure on China to appreciate its currency, the renminbi, which has been kept low against the United States dollar, and also to find new weapons to fight inflation and the threat of a property bubble.
Raising the value of the currency would make China's imports of oil, cotton, grain and other commodities less expensive, alleviating some pricing pressures. But China worries that a stronger currency could hurt struggling factories in the coastal provinces because they operate on thin margins and export goods based on contracts denominated in dollars.
A stimulus package from Beijing drove growth last year and much of this year by pressing banks to engage in aggressive lending and encouraging local governments to begin an investment binge and initiate huge infrastructure projects.
Also, the Chinese money supply has continued to balloon at a time when wages are rising and bad weather is affecting food supplies. The government said Friday that food prices jumped in November. Many analysts expect wages to rise sharply next year -- exacerbating inflationary pressure.
''By far the biggest challenge is inflation,'' said Andy Xie, an economist in Shanghai who formerly worked for Morgan Stanley. ''Every social turmoil is related to inflation because it wipes out peoples' earnings.''
Beijing says it is now determined to restrain growth and fight inflation. The government moved Friday to raise the reserve ratio requirement for state-run banks for the sixth time in a year in the hopes of controlling what is now seen as overly aggressive bank lending.
Earlier this year, Beijing raised interest rates for the first time in nearly three years. And more recently, the authorities in Beijing said they would tighten monetary policies. Housing prices are soaring as well, which is adding to the tensions.
Government pressure on state-run banks has had some results. Growth has moderated in recent months, but wages continue to climb and food prices seem to be rising even faster.
The reasons for Beijing's concerns are clear: Inflation could overheat the economy but also create troubles as the value of workers' earnings plummets. That could set off social unrest, one of the chief fears of the ruling Communist Party.
Beijing is worried that untamed growth will also create new strains on the nation's banking system, particularly if government policies force state-run companies to pay higher interest rates on their loans.
The banking system is still dominated by a handful of state banks and financial institutions.
In its report Saturday, after the release of new data that showed strong growth in industrial production, retail sales and fixed asset investments, Goldman Sachs analysts said some areas might be growing even faster than the government is reporting, because of efforts to hide growth from experts.
''Inflation has become more widespread, highlighting it is more driven by fundamental forces, especially overly rapid aggregate demand growth, instead of random events such as bad weather, which pushed up food prices,'' Yu Song and Helen Qiao, analysts for Goldman Sachs, said in a report released Saturday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Health Care and the Deficit

 BODY:
Here is a basic truth about the deficit: In the long run, it cannot be fixed, without reining in spending on Medicare and Medicaid.
This year, Medicare, Medicaid and a related children's health insurance program will account for more than 20 percent of all federal spending -- higher than Social Security or defense. Unless there are big changes, by 2035 federal health care spending -- driven by rising medical costs and an aging population -- is projected to account for almost 40 percent of the budget.
Two bipartisan commissions have issued recommendations to sharply reduce annual deficits, in part through bold changes -- some sound, others dubious -- in the way health care is paid for. Here are some of the issues that Congress will need to evaluate: 
COST-SHIFTING The most disturbing element of both reports is that, in their efforts to show quick savings, they shift much of the burden from the federal budget to individuals or, in some cases, to states. That may make the federal deficit look better, but it is a shell game that produces no real reduction in the cost of health care.
Both commissions would save the government significant money by forcing all but the poorest Medicare beneficiaries to pay higher premiums and co-insurance.
The White House commission, headed by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, proposes to wring nearly $400 billion from health care spending between 2012 and 2020, of which the biggest single element -- $110 billion -- would come from increased cost-sharing by Medicare beneficiaries. The second commission, an independent panel headed by Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin, seeks to save $137 billion from Medicare cost-sharing.
Forcing beneficiaries to pay more is a reasonable way to get them to think twice before undergoing an expensive test that may not be critically necessary. But there is a big risk that people on modest incomes might forgo needed care. Beneficiaries might have to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars more out of pocket.
It would make sense to require wealthier older people to pick up more of the cost of their own health care. But almost half of all Medicare beneficiaries live on low incomes -- below $21,000 a year for an individual and $28,000 for a couple. Cost-shifting must not be allowed to undermine the health or financial security of elderly or disabled Americans of modest means.
END OF A TAX BREAK The Domenici-Rivlin panel, the more aggressive on health care, would also phase out the exclusion that exempts workers from paying taxes for employer-subsidized insurance, a benefit that also encourages excessive use of medical care. The long-term gain in tax revenue could be huge -- more than $3 trillion between 2012 and 2030 and almost $10 trillion by 2040.
The health care reform law already limits the tax exclusion for the most costly employer plans, and eliminating it entirely sounds like a good idea in principle. But it would increase the financial burden on middle- and lower-income employees. That is why they would need to have access to competitive insurance exchanges that will open in 2014 and, depending on their need, federal subsidies. Such subsidies could amount to roughly half of the tax revenues gained by eliminating the exclusion, but the net reduction of the deficit would still be large.
VOUCHERS FOR MEDICARE The Domenici-Rivlin panel has a far-reaching proposal to give Medicare enrollees vouchers to buy coverage from Medicare or a competing private plan offered on a Medicare exchange. The voucher would increase in value at roughly half the likely rate of medical inflation. If the cost of coverage rose faster than that, the beneficiary would have to pay an extra premium to cover the difference or seek a cheaper plan.
The commission believes that competition on the exchanges will cause insurance plans to find ways to lower premiums. It also believes beneficiaries will restrain their own spending. The panel projects savings from premium support and its near-term cuts and cost-shifting could be huge -- more than $2 trillion through 2030 and more than $7 trillion through 2040.
We see considerable merit in having traditional Medicare and private plans compete for business, but only if the competition is fair. There would have to be tight regulation to require plans to accept all comers, to set limits to cost-sharing.
SPENDING CAPS The health care reform law already seeks to cap the growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary to roughly half the rate it has been increasing in recent decades. It empowers a new board to find savings should the target be breached, subject to Congressional veto. The Bowles-Simpson commission would expand that approach by placing a cap on total federal spending for health care -- not just Medicare and Medicaid but the subsidies on new exchanges and tax exemptions. But the commission punts on what to do should the growth cap be exceeded, as many experts deem likely.
FIXING THE SYSTEM The best way to lower health care spending is to reform the dysfunctional health care system whose costs seem unrelated to the quality of care delivered. The reform law makes a good start, sponsoring research to determine which treatments are effective and which are not, starting pilot projects to change the way care is delivered and paid for, and setting up new organizations to rush successful approaches into wide use in Medicare and ultimately the private sector.
Neither commission goes much further, probably because reformers had already scooped up most of the plausible approaches. The White House commission wants to speed up the adoption rate for reforms shown to work in pilot projects, an idea we heartily endorse.
Lawmakers from both parties need to take a serious look at the commission's recommendations. So far, we have not heard much more than the usual posturing from either side of the aisle. Meanwhile the Republicans are still vowing to repeal the new health care reform law or block its implementation. That is yet one more reason why their claims to fiscal rectitude are so unbelievable.

HEADLINE: HOUSE ADVANTAGE; A Secretive Banking Elite Rules Derivatives Trading

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
On the third Wednesday of every month, the nine members of an elite Wall Street society gather in Midtown Manhattan.
The men share a common goal: to protect the interests of big banks in the vast market for derivatives, one of the most profitable -- and controversial -- fields in finance. They also share a common secret: The details of their meetings, even their identities, have been strictly confidential.
Drawn from giants like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the bankers form a powerful committee that helps oversee trading in derivatives, instruments which, like insurance, are used to hedge risk.
In theory, this group exists to safeguard the integrity of the multitrillion-dollar market. In practice, it also defends the dominance of the big banks. 
The banks in this group, which is affiliated with a new derivatives clearinghouse, have fought to block other banks from entering the market, and they are also trying to thwart efforts to make full information on prices and fees freely available.
Banks' influence over this market, and over clearinghouses like the one this select group advises, has costly implications for businesses large and small, like Dan Singer's home heating-oil company in Westchester County, north of New York City.
This fall, many of Mr. Singer's customers purchased fixed-rate plans to lock in winter heating oil at around $3 a gallon. While that price was above the prevailing $2.80 a gallon then, the contracts will protect homeowners if bitterly cold weather pushes the price higher.
But Mr. Singer wonders if his company, Robison Oil, should be getting a better deal. He uses derivatives like swaps and options to create his fixed plans. But he has no idea how much lower his prices -- and his customers' prices -- could be, he says, because banks don't disclose fees associated with the derivatives.
''At the end of the day, I don't know if I got a fair price, or what they're charging me,'' Mr. Singer said.
Derivatives shift risk from one party to another, and they offer many benefits, like enabling Mr. Singer to sell his fixed plans without having to bear all the risk that oil prices could suddenly rise. Derivatives are also big business on Wall Street. Banks collect many billions of dollars annually in undisclosed fees associated with these instruments -- an amount that almost certainly would be lower if there were more competition and transparent prices.
Just how much derivatives trading costs ordinary Americans is uncertain. The size and reach of this market has grown rapidly over the past two decades. Pension funds today use derivatives to hedge investments. States and cities use them to try to hold down borrowing costs. Airlines use them to secure steady fuel prices. Food companies use them to lock in prices of commodities like wheat or beef.
The marketplace as it functions now ''adds up to higher costs to all Americans,'' said Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates most derivatives. More oversight of the banks in this market is needed, he said.
But big banks influence the rules governing derivatives through a variety of industry groups. The banks' latest point of influence are clearinghouses like ICE Trust, which holds the monthly meetings with the nine bankers in New York.
Under the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, many derivatives will be traded via such clearinghouses. Mr. Gensler wants to lessen banks' control over these new institutions. But Republican lawmakers, many of whom received large campaign contributions from bankers who want to influence how the derivatives rules are written, say they plan to push back against much of the coming reform. On Thursday, the commission canceled a vote over a proposal to make prices more transparent, raising speculation that Mr. Gensler did not have enough support from his fellow commissioners.
The Department of Justice is looking into derivatives, too. The department's antitrust unit is actively investigating ''the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries,'' according to a department spokeswoman.
Indeed, the derivatives market today reminds some experts of the Nasdaq stock market in the 1990s. Back then, the Justice Department discovered that Nasdaq market makers were secretly colluding to protect their own profits. Following that scandal, reforms and electronic trading systems cut Nasdaq stock trading costs to 1/20th of their former level -- an enormous savings for investors.
''When you limit participation in the governance of an entity to a few like-minded institutions or individuals who have an interest in keeping competitors out, you have the potential for bad things to happen. It's antitrust 101,'' said Robert E. Litan, who helped oversee the Justice Department's Nasdaq investigation as deputy assistant attorney general and is now a fellow at the Kauffman Foundation. ''The history of derivatives trading is it has grown up as a very concentrated industry, and old habits are hard to break.''
Representatives from the nine banks that dominate the market declined to comment on the Department of Justice investigation.
Clearing involves keeping track of trades and providing a central repository for money backing those wagers. A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, which is among the most influential of the group, said this system will reduce the risks in the market. She said that Deutsche is focused on ensuring this process is put in place without disrupting the marketplace.
The Deutsche spokeswoman also said the banks' role in this process has been a success, saying in a statement that the effort ''is one of the best examples of public-private partnerships.''
Established, But Can't Get In
The Bank of New York Mellon's origins go back to 1784, when it was founded by Alexander Hamilton. Today, it provides administrative services on more than $23 trillion of institutional money.
Recently, the bank has been seeking to enter the inner circle of the derivatives market, but so far, it has been rebuffed.
Bank of New York officials say they have been thwarted by competitors who control important committees at the new clearinghouses, which were set up in the wake of the financial crisis.
Bank of New York Mellon has been trying to become a so-called clearing member since early this year. But three of the four main clearinghouses told the bank that its derivatives operation has too little capital, and thus potentially poses too much risk to the overall market.
The bank dismisses that explanation as absurd. ''We are not a nobody,'' said Sanjay Kannambadi, chief executive of BNY Mellon Clearing, a subsidiary created to get into the business. ''But we don't qualify. We certainly think that's kind of crazy.''
The real reason the bank is being shut out, he said, is that rivals want to preserve their profit margins, and they are the ones who helped write the membership rules.
Mr. Kannambadi said Bank of New York's clients asked it to enter the derivatives business because they believe they are being charged too much by big banks. Its entry could lower fees. Others that have yet to gain full entry to the derivatives trading club are the State Street Corporation, and small brokerage firms like MF Global and Newedge.
The criteria seem arbitrary, said Marcus Katz, a senior vice president at Newedge, which is owned by two big French banks.
''It appears that the membership criteria were set so that a certain group of market participants could meet that, and everyone else would have to jump through hoops,'' Mr. Katz said.
The one new derivatives clearinghouse that has welcomed Newedge, Bank of New York and the others -- Nasdaq -- has been avoided by the big derivatives banks.
Only the Insiders Know
How did big banks come to have such influence that they can decide who can compete with them?
Ironically, this development grew in part out of worries during the height of the financial crisis in 2008. A major concern during the meltdown was that no one -- not even government regulators -- fully understood the size and interconnections of the derivatives market, especially the market in credit default swaps, which insure against defaults of companies or mortgages bonds. The panic led to the need to bail out the American International Group, for instance, which had C.D.S. contracts with many large banks.
In the midst of the turmoil, regulators ordered banks to speed up plans -- long in the making -- to set up a clearinghouse to handle derivatives trading. The intent was to reduce risk and increase stability in the market.
Two established exchanges that trade commodities and futures, the InterContinentalExchange, or ICE, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, set up clearinghouses, and, so did Nasdaq.
Each of these new clearinghouses had to persuade big banks to join their efforts, and they doled out membership on their risk committees, which is where trading rules are written, as an incentive.
None of the three clearinghouses would divulge the members of their risk committees when asked by a reporter. But two people with direct knowledge of ICE's committee said the bank members are: Thomas J. Benison of JPMorgan Chase & Company; James J. Hill of Morgan Stanley; Athanassios Diplas of Deutsche Bank; Paul Hamill of UBS; Paul Mitrokostas of Barclays; Andy Hubbard of Credit Suisse; Oliver Frankel of Goldman Sachs; Ali Balali of Bank of America; and Biswarup Chatterjee of Citigroup.
Through representatives, these bankers declined to discuss the committee or the derivatives market. Some of the spokesmen noted that the bankers have expertise that helps the clearinghouse.
Many of these same people hold influential positions at other clearinghouses, or on committees at the powerful International Swaps and Derivatives Association, which helps govern the market.
Critics have called these banks the ''derivatives dealers club,'' and they warn that the club is unlikely to give up ground easily.
''The revenue these dealers make on derivatives is very large and so the incentive they have to protect those revenues is extremely large,'' said Darrell Duffie, a professor at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, who studied the derivatives market earlier this year with Federal Reserve researchers. ''It will be hard for the dealers to keep their market share if everybody who can prove their creditworthiness is allowed into the clearinghouses. So they are making arguments that others shouldn't be allowed in.''
Perhaps no business in finance is as profitable today as derivatives. Not making loans. Not offering credit cards. Not advising on mergers and acquisitions. Not managing money for the wealthy.
The precise amount that banks make trading derivatives isn't known, but there is anecdotal evidence of their profitability. Former bank traders who spoke on condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements with their former employers said their banks typically earned $25,000 for providing $25 million of insurance against the risk that a corporation might default on its debt via the swaps market. These traders turn over millions of dollars in these trades every day, and credit default swaps are just one of many kinds of derivatives.
The secrecy surrounding derivatives trading is a key factor enabling banks to make such large profits.
If an investor trades shares of Google or Coca-Cola or any other company on a stock exchange, the price -- and the commission, or fee -- are known. Electronic trading has made this information available to anyone with a computer, while also increasing competition -- and sharply lowering the cost of trading. Even corporate bonds have become more transparent recently. Trading costs dropped there almost immediately after prices became more visible in 2002.
Not so with derivatives. For many, there is no central exchange, like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, where the prices of derivatives are listed. Instead, when a company or an investor wants to buy a derivative contract for, say, oil or wheat or securitized mortgages, an order is placed with a trader at a bank. The trader matches that order with someone selling the same type of derivative.
Banks explain that many derivatives trades have to work this way because they are often customized, unlike shares of stock. One share of Google is the same as any other. But the terms of an oil derivatives contract can vary greatly.
And the profits on most derivatives are masked. In most cases, buyers are told only what they have to pay for the derivative contract, say $25 million. That amount is more than the seller gets, but how much more -- $5,000, $25,000 or $50,000 more -- is unknown. That's because the seller also is told only the amount he will receive. The difference between the two is the bank's fee and profit. So, the bigger the difference, the better for the bank -- and the worse for the customers.
It would be like a real estate agent selling a house, but the buyer knowing only what he paid and the seller knowing only what he received. The agent would pocket the difference as his fee, rather than disclose it. Moreover, only the real estate agent -- and neither buyer nor seller -- would have easy access to the prices paid recently for other homes on the same block.
An Electronic Exchange?
Two years ago, Kenneth C. Griffin, owner of the giant hedge fund Citadel Group, which is based in Chicago, proposed open pricing for commonly traded derivatives, by quoting their prices electronically. Citadel oversees $11 billion in assets, so saving even a few percentage points in costs on each trade could add up to tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
But Mr. Griffin's proposal for an electronic exchange quickly ran into opposition, and what happened is a window into how banks have fiercely fought competition and open pricing. To get a transparent exchange going, Citadel offered the use of its technological prowess for a joint venture with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is best-known as a trading outpost for contracts on commodities like coffee and cotton. The goal was to set up a clearinghouse as well as an electronic trading system that would display prices for credit default swaps.
Big banks that handle most derivatives trades, including Citadel's, didn't like Citadel's idea. Electronic trading might connect customers directly with each other, cutting out the banks as middlemen.
So the banks responded in the fall of 2008 by pairing with ICE, one of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's rivals, which was setting up its own clearinghouse. The banks attached a number of conditions on that partnership, which came in the form of a merger between ICE's clearinghouse and a nascent clearinghouse that the banks were establishing. These conditions gave the banks significant power at ICE's clearinghouse, according to two people with knowledge of the deal. For instance, the banks insisted that ICE install the chief executive of their effort as the head of the joint effort. That executive, Dirk Pruis, left after about a year and now works at Goldman Sachs. Through a spokesman, he declined to comment.
The banks also refused to allow the deal with ICE to close until the clearinghouse's rulebook was established, with provisions in the banks' favor. Key among those were the membership rules, which required members to hold large amounts of capital in derivatives units, a condition that was prohibitive even for some large banks like the Bank of New York.
The banks also required ICE to provide market data exclusively to Markit, a little-known company that plays a pivotal role in derivatives. Backed by Goldman, JPMorgan and several other banks, Markit provides crucial information about derivatives, like prices.
Kevin Gould, who is the president of Markit and was involved in the clearinghouse merger, said the banks were simply being prudent and wanted rules that protected the market and themselves.
''The one thing I know the banks are concerned about is their risk capital,'' he said. ''You really are going to get some comfort that the way the entity operates isn't going to put you at undue risk.''
Even though the banks were working with ICE, Citadel and the C.M.E. continued to move forward with their exchange. They, too, needed to work with Markit, because it owns the rights to certain derivatives indexes. But Markit put them in a tough spot by basically insisting that every trade involve at least one bank, since the banks are the main parties that have licenses with Markit.
This demand from Markit effectively secured a permanent role for the big derivatives banks since Citadel and the C.M.E. could not move forward without Markit's agreement. And so, essentially boxed in, they agreed to the terms, according to the two people with knowledge of the matter. (A spokesman for C.M.E. said last week that the exchange did not cave to Markit's terms.)
Still, even after that deal was complete, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange soon had second thoughts about working with Citadel and about introducing electronic screens at all. The C.M.E. backed out of the deal in mid-2009, ending Mr. Griffin's dream of a new, electronic trading system.
With Citadel out of the picture, the banks agreed to join the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's clearinghouse effort. The exchange set up a risk committee that, like ICE's committee, was mainly populated by bankers.
It remains unclear why the C.M.E. ended its electronic trading initiative. Two people with knowledge of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's clearinghouse said the banks refused to get involved unless the exchange dropped Citadel and the entire plan for electronic trading.
Kim Taylor, the president of Chicago Mercantile Exchange's clearing division, said ''the market'' simply wasn't interested in Mr. Griffin's idea.
Critics now say the banks have an edge because they have had early control of the new clearinghouses' risk committees. Ms. Taylor at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said the people on those committees are supposed to look out for the interest of the broad market, rather than their own narrow interests. She likened the banks' role to that of Washington lawmakers who look out for the interests of the nation, not just their constituencies.
''It's not like the sort of representation where if I'm elected to be the representative from the state of Illinois, I go there to represent the state of Illinois,'' Ms. Taylor said in an interview.
Officials at ICE, meantime, said they solicit views from customers through a committee that is separate from the bank-dominated risk committee.
''We spent and we still continue to spend a lot of time on thinking about governance,'' said Peter Barsoom, the chief operating officer of ICE Trust. ''We want to be sure that we have all the right stakeholders appropriately represented.''
Mr. Griffin said last week that customers have so far paid the price for not yet having electronic trading. He puts the toll, by a rough estimate, in the tens of billions of dollars, saying that electronic trading would remove much of this ''economic rent the dealers enjoy from a market that is so opaque.''
''It's a stunning amount of money,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''The key players today in the derivatives market are very apprehensive about whether or not they will be winners or losers as we move towards more transparent, fairer markets, and since they're not sure if they'll be winners or losers, their basic instinct is to resist change.''
In, Out and Around Henhouse
The result of the maneuvering of the past couple years is that big banks dominate the risk committees of not one, but two of the most prominent new clearinghouses in the United States.
That puts them in a pivotal position to determine how derivatives are traded.
Under the Dodd-Frank bill, the clearinghouses were given broad authority. The risk committees there will help decide what prices will be charged for clearing trades, on top of fees banks collect for matching buyers and sellers, and how much money customers must put up as collateral to cover potential losses.
Perhaps more important, the risk committees will recommend which derivatives should be handled through clearinghouses, and which should be exempt.
Regulators will have the final say. But banks, which lobbied heavily to limit derivatives regulation in the Dodd-Frank bill, are likely to argue that few types of derivatives should have to go through clearinghouses. Critics contend that the bankers will try to keep many types of derivatives away from the clearinghouses, since clearinghouses represent a step towards broad electronic trading that could decimate profits.
The banks already have a head start. Even a newly proposed rule to limit the banks' influence over clearing allows them to retain majorities on risk committees. It remains unclear whether regulators creating the new rules -- on topics like transparency and possible electronic trading -- will drastically change derivatives trading, or leave the bankers with great control.
One former regulator warned against deferring to the banks. Theo Lubke, who until this fall oversaw the derivatives reforms at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said banks do not always think of the market as a whole as they help write rules.
''Fundamentally, the banks are not good at self-regulation,'' Mr. Lubke said in a panel last March at Columbia University. ''That's not their expertise, that's not their primary interest.''

HEADLINE: One Corner of Stocks That Fared Just Fine

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AFTER a four-month stock market rally, some investors are starting to wonder if equities could be on the verge of finally outshining bonds.
That is a valid question if you are focusing on large-cap stocks. Yet throughout this so-called lost decade for equities, another category of equity never really took a back seat to bonds: shares of fast-growing small companies.
This year, the Standard & Poor's 600 index of small-company stocks has gained 25 percent. That is nearly double what the S.& P. 500 index of large stocks has returned year to date. Even more impressive is that small-cap stocks are up around 8 percent annually over the last decade, a period in which blue chip stocks have gone nowhere, with an annual return of 0.8 percent. 
At first blush, this may seem like yet more bad news for blue chips, which have been out of favor since the Internet stock bubble burst in March 2000. But many market strategists argue that the recent surge for small-cap stocks might turn out to be a good omen for shares of large domestic companies.
For starters, the spectacular outperformance by small stocks has come at a time when bonds -- the market's most popular asset class by a wide margin since the global financial crisis struck in 2007 -- are showing signs of stumbling.
As interest rates have risen recently, the average long-term government bond fund, for example, has lost more than 9 percent in the last three months. Many municipal bond funds and some corporate fixed income portfolios also have had losses recently.
The stunning small-stock performance could push fearful bond investors back into stock funds, which have had net outflows of more than $40 billion since the start of 2009. And that could provide a boost for the blue chips down the road.
''When mom-and-pop Americans decide they're going to buy stocks again, they won't be buying small companies that they've never heard of,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer. ''They're going to invest in big stocks that they know.''
The performance of small stocks could also be viewed as a sign of confidence that the global economy is on the road to recovery. And that means the bull market in equities that began in March 2009 could live on to a third year -- which is another potentially positive development for blue chips.
Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for Standard & Poor's, studied the performance of large and small stocks in bull markets going back to 1949. He found that typically, small stocks outperform blue chips by a wide margin in the first 12 months of a new bull market. Small-company stocks also maintain a slim lead in the next 12 months.
But. he said, ''in the third year of a bull market, investors prefer larger boats, as they expect the seas to become a bit more treacherous.''
James B. Stack, editor of the InvesTech Market Analyst newsletter and a market historian, agrees. ''Historically speaking, as bull markets age, investors tend to grow more conservative,'' he said. ''I'll be surprised if we don't see the S.& P. 500 perform as well or better than small caps in 2011.''
The odds of that happening should grow if the economic recovery gains strength next year -- to the point where interest rates start to climb consistently. Smaller companies tend to rely more on bank financing, so a jump in rates often affects their profits more sharply than those of larger and more financially stable businesses, market strategists say.
That is what occurred at the end of the downturn in the early 1990s.
As yields on 10-year Treasury securities fell from 1991 through 1993, small stocks gained more than twice as much as the S.& P. 500 did. But when those yields spiked from around 5 percent to more than 8 percent from late 1993 to mid 1994, the market shifted and blue chip stocks began leading the way -- and kept winning throughout the rest of the decade.
Small-cap dominance could be ending if central banks around the world start signaling that they are confident enough in the recovery to start hiking short-term interest rates, said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management. ''You're seeing some of that already in places like China,'' he said, but added the Federal Reserve Board and central banks in Europe are far from making such a determination.
THE recent surge in small-cap stock prices has made large caps attractive in another way: their valuations are cheaper. After the recent rally, the S.& P. 600's price/earnings ratio stands at 27. That's a 75 percent premium to the P/E ratio for large stocks.
In recent decades, small stocks have traded at a slight premium to the broad market, but since 1995 that premium has averaged only 15 percent.
''Frankly, I find valuations on large caps much more compelling than for small,'' said Thomas H. Forester, manager of the Forester Value Fund.
He adds that he also likes blue chips because they have been out of fashion for so long, ''From the standpoint of a contrarian investor, when you see something happen for 10 years, you shouldn't expect it to continue to outperform over next 10 years.''

HEADLINE: Reality Check

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Maureen Dowd is off today.

 BODY:
The failed attempt by the U.S. to bribe Israel with a $3 billion security assistance package, diplomatic cover and advanced F-35 fighter aircraft -- if Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu would simply agree to a 90-day settlements freeze to resume talks with the Palestinians -- has been enormously clarifying. It demonstrates just how disconnected from reality both the Israeli and the Palestinian leaderships have become.
Oil is to Saudi Arabia what unconditional American aid and affection are to Israel -- and what unconditional Arab and European aid and affection are to the Palestinians: a hallucinogenic drug that enables them each to think they can defy the laws of history, geography and demography. It is long past time that we stop being their crack dealers. At a time of nearly 10 percent unemployment in America, we have the Israelis and the Palestinians sitting over there with their arms folded, waiting for more U.S. assurances or money to persuade them to do what is manifestly in their own interest: negotiate a two-state deal. Shame on them, and shame us. You can't want peace more than the parties themselves, and that is exactly where America is today. The people running Israel and Palestine have other priorities. It is time we left them alone to pursue them -- and to live with the consequences. 
They just don't get it: we're not their grandfather's America anymore. We have bigger problems. Israeli and Palestinian negotiators should take a minute and put the following five words into Google: ''budget cuts and fire departments.'' Here's what they'll find: American city after city -- Phoenix, Cincinnati, Austin, Washington, Jacksonville, Sacramento, Philadelphia -- all having to cut their fire departments. Then put in these four words: ''schools and budget cuts.'' One of the top stories listed is from The Christian Science Monitor: ''As state and local governments slash spending and federal stimulus dries up, school budget cuts for the next academic year could be the worst in a generation.''
I guarantee you, if someone came to these cities and said, ''We have $3 billion we'd like to give to your schools and fire departments if you'll just do what is manifestly in your own interest,'' their only answer would be: ''Where do we sign?'' And so it should have been with Israel.
Israel, when America, a country that has lavished billions on you over the last 50 years and taken up your defense in countless international forums, asks you to halt settlements for three months to get peace talks going, there is only one right answer, and it is not ''How much?'' It is: ''Yes, whatever you want, because you're our only true friend in the world.''
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, what are you thinking? Ehud Olmert, the former Israeli prime minister, offered you a great two-state deal, including East Jerusalem -- and you let it fritter away. Now, instead of chasing after Obama and telling him you'll show up for negotiations anywhere under any conditions that the president asks, you're also setting your own terms. Here's some free advice: When America goes weak, if you think the Chinese will deliver Israel for you, you're wrong. I know China well. It will sell you out for a boatload of Israeli software, drones and microchips so fast that your head will spin.
I understand the problem: Israeli and Palestinian leaders cannot end the conflict between each other without having a civil war within their respective communities. Netanyahu would have to take on the settlers and Abbas would have to take on Hamas and the Fatah radicals. Both men have silent majorities that would back them if they did, but neither man feels so uncomfortable with his present situation to risk that civil war inside to make peace outside. There are no Abe Lincolns out there.
What this means, argues the Hebrew University philosopher Moshe Halbertal, is that the window for a two-state solution is rapidly closing. Israel will end up permanently occupying the West Bank with its 2.5 million Palestinians. We will have a one-state solution. Israel will have inside its belly 2.5 million Palestinians without the rights of citizenship, along with 1.5 million Israeli Arabs. ''Then the only question will be what will be the nature of this one state -- it will either be apartheid or Lebanon,'' said Halbertal. ''We will be confronted by two horrors.''
The most valuable thing that President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton could do now is just get out of the picture -- so both leaders and both peoples have an unimpeded view of their horrible future together in one state, if they can't separate. We must not give them any more excuses, like: ''Here comes the secretary of state again. Be patient. Something is happening. We're working on a deal. We're close. If only the Americans weren't so naive, we were just about to compromise. ... Be patient.''
It's all a fraud. America must get out of the way so Israelis and Palestinians can see clearly, without any obstructions, what reckless choices their leaders are making. Make no mistake, I am for the most active U.S. mediation effort possible to promote peace, but the initiative has to come from them. The Middle East only puts a smile on your face when it starts with them.

HEADLINE: Following the Money, Doctors Ration Care

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
UNEQUAL access to health care is hardly a new phenomenon in the United States, but the country is moving toward rationing on a scale that is unprecedented here. Wealthy people will always be able to buy most of what they want. But for everyone else, if we stay on the current course, the lines are likely to get longer and longer.
The underlying problem is that doctors are reimbursed at different rates, depending on whether they see a patient with private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid. As demand increases relative to supply, many doctors are likely to turn away patients whose coverage would pay the lower rates. 
Let's see how this works. Medicare is the major federal health program for the elderly, who vote at high rates and are politically influential, and so it is relatively well financed. Medicaid, which serves poorer people, is paid for partly by state governments, and the poor have less political clout than the elderly, so it is less well financed. Depending on the state and on the malady, it is common for Medicaid to reimburse at only 40 percent to 80 percent the rate of Medicare. Private insurance pays more than either.
A result is that physicians often make Medicaid patients wait or refuse to see them altogether. Medicare patients are also beginning to face lines, as doctors increasingly prefer patients with private insurance.
Access to health care will become problematic, and not only because the population is aging and demand is rising. Unfortunately, the new health care legislation is likely to speed this process. Under the new law, tens of millions of additional Americans will receive coverage, through Medicaid or private insurance. The new recipients of private insurance will gain the most, but people previously covered through Medicaid will lose.
Ideally, higher demand for medical care would prompt increases in supply, which in turn would lower prices and expand access. But the health care sector does not always work this way.
Doctors are highly regulated and in that manner restricted in supply. The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that the United States could face a shortage of 150,000 doctors in the next 15 years. To its credit, the new health care bill does improve incentives for general practitioners, but still, supply probably will not keep up with the crush of demand.
We could go further by giving greater scope to nurse practitioners, admitting more immigrant doctors, reforming malpractice law and allowing cheap, retail ''Wal-Mart style'' medical care, all to increase access and affordability. Yet these changes do not seem to be in the offing, so access is likely to decline.
The health care bill will further privilege private insurance coverage by offering many individuals new subsidies for its purchase. That will create incentives for employers to game the system, dropping or discouraging coverage and sending their workers to buy health insurance on the more expensive federally subsidized exchanges. That will strain the federal health care budget. This problem is outlined by Amy Monahan and Daniel Schwarcz, law professors at the University of Minnesota, in their new paper ''Will Employers Undermine Health Care Reform by Dumping Sick Employees?''
There is also the danger that a few governors with tight budgets will shirk their Medicaid responsibilities, with an eye toward sending potential recipients to the federally subsidized insurance exchanges. In both cases, the quest for a better deal will strain the federal budget.
The American system of federalism, with its checks and balances and slow policy evolution, has many strengths, but it has also helped create this crazy quilt of health care reimbursement rates. The more demand-side pressure is placed on medical supply, the more Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements rates will determine who and what is rationed.
One option is to simply allow budget pressures to dominate, forcing down even private insurance reimbursements. Most people would end up with low, Medicaid-like reimbursement rates, and would endure long waits and low-quality service. But wealthier people could jump the line by paying more. Think of ''Medicaid for everyone'' but the rich.
An alternative is giving most people means-tested vouchers for a fixed amount of insurance coverage -- which can run out or face up-front caps -- making Medicaid and Medicare less of a blank check. The cost explosion would be checked by shifting more of the burden onto consumers. We would have better incentives for consumer-oriented care, and cost control, but we would be making an explicit public decision, at some point or another, to let some people do without medical care.
Recently the Arizona state government restricted transplant coverage for Medicaid patients, but it remains to be seen whether such measures can be applied to Medicare recipients. President Obama already has reversed some of the planned, budget-saving cuts to Medicare.
AN entirely different approach is suggested by the system in Singapore, where the government requires savings (say 10 percent to 12 percent of income), patients pay for medical care from those savings, and the government takes care of additional catastrophic expenses. That system has a good record for cost control and access, but would Americans accept so much required saving?
The default course is to maintain or extend Medicare reimbursement rates, raise taxes considerably and accept that Medicaid recipients will face worsening health care access. If you hear of a new solution to the health care puzzle, put aside the politics and instead think through the endgame. Ask not about the rhetoric, but rather about the reimbursement rates.

HEADLINE: HOT SPOTS: Why We Might Fight, 2011 Edition

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
RARE minerals. Food and water. Arable soil. Air-cleansing forests.
In the intellectual heart of the American military and policy-making world, these are emerging not just as environmental issues, but as the potential stuff of conflict in the 21st century.
In some ways, the role of resources in shaping conflict is nothing new. Much as the Spanish conquistadors sought gold, Saddam Hussein fought for Kuwait's oil. And downstream lands have long worried that neighbors will limit water flowing in the Nile, Euphrates and Jordan. 
Now a new field of systematic study is opening within research centers, the Pentagon and intelligence institutions. It assumes that the 21st century will be shaped not just by competitive economic growth, but also by potentially disruptive scarcities -- depletion of minerals; desertification of land; pollution or overuse of water; weather changes that kill fish and farms.
National security experts have begun to label such factors threats to ''natural security'' and to study them, often alongside environmental or advocacy groups. A basic question frames their thinking: What are the new relationships among resources, diplomacy, crisis and conflict?
One hint of the complexity can be seen along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. A war against terrorists seems, at first, to have little to do with resources. But look again: This fall, outraged Pakistani gangs at the border were torching fuel trucks that carry supplies vital to allied troops. And at the end of that supply line, American planning was a small step ahead -- a few Marines were trying out new-tech solar collectors, to cut their dependence on diesel fuel.
Strategists also knew that there were other stakes in the outcome. Afghanistan has been seen for decades as a potential route for pipelines carrying Central Asian gas -- but only if there is peace. And underground lie huge deposits of riches like lithium, which is crucial to batteries for electronic devices. China in particular has a large interest in those.
The National Intelligence Council has a major effort under way to analyze threats from water and food shortages related to climate change and other environmental causes, one senior American intelligence official said.
National security officials are careful to say that resources are only one factor in the development of conflicts. How politics and diplomacy shape relationships is, in the end, decisive. ''But these can be a trigger of instability,'' said one senior American intelligence official, whose job forbids him to speak for attribution. ''They cause the magnification of other issues.''
Last summer, for example, flooding that uprooted millions of Pakistanis stirred fear in Washington that militant movements might prove more adept than Pakistan's weak government at delivering aid. Last month, the advocacy group Refugees International reported that the Pakistani Army did respond effectively, but that civilian authorities struggled and American and international agencies should be better prepared for climate-related calamities.
Senior military and intelligence officials who focus on ''natural security'' issues say the Obama administration has shown a greater understanding of the subtleties than its predecessor, in part because it does not challenge basic assumptions about the harmful impact of climate change.
''But the issues are so complex, the number of actors and the uncertainties are high,'' the senior American intelligence officer said. ''So the analysis is still speculative. It makes planning much harder and preventive action much harder.''
The natural security risks take many forms. Here are five scenarios, current or anticipated.

In her analysis of the factors hindering a recovery (''It's the Big Questions That Slow Growth,'' Economic View, Dec. 5), Christina D. Romer does not mention one critical source of uncertainty. That is the crushing state and local obligations that can be met only through crushing increases in property and income taxes. 
Washington's unwillingness to make hard budget decisions pales compared with state and local governments'. The Illinois legislature just passed a bill that would compel local entities to pay their share of pension obligations. Chicago's chief financial officer warned that if the governor signed the bill, the city could be forced to raise property taxes 60 percent. And Gov. Pat Quinn, with the support of dozens of legislators, is pushing for an income tax increase.
There are three claims on future income: consumption, debt service and taxes. Businesses and individuals can control only two of the three.

HEADLINE: Batting Cleanup at Bank of America

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Charlotte, N.C.
BRIAN MOYNIHAN isn't one to look back. And as the chief executive of Bank of America, he has plenty of reasons not to.
His company is staggering under the weight of his predecessors' decisions, and each day seems to bring more bad news. More than 1.3 million of the bank's customers are behind on their home loans, all 50 state attorneys general are investigating the industry's foreclosure practices and Bank of America has become a leading symbol of the mortgage mess.
When the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, bragged late last month that his group was about to ''take down'' an American bank with a mother lode of damaging insider documents, the scuttlebutt on Wall Street quickly turned to Bank of America, sending its shares down more than 3 percent in a day.
But don't bother feeling sorry for Mr. Moynihan. As far as he's concerned, things are just fine. 
''It's been a great year and we've learned a lot,'' he says during an interview in his office here, 58 floors above downtown Charlotte. ''There's not a better job in the world.''
However improbable that may sound, his damn-the-torpedoes stance has helped him stabilize a company that was in such desperate straits that it required two federal bailouts that totaled $45 billion. He's even returned the bank to profitability -- after a little help from that sizable taxpayer-supported cushion, of course.
But since he was named to the position a year ago this week, Mr. Moynihan's strategy has failed to convince investors, analysts, and some customers that Bank of America is headed in the right direction. The bank's shares have fallen 18 percent during his tenure.
''Many investors are trying to put their arms around Bank of America's problems and have been left fluttering in the wind,'' says Mike Mayo, a bank analyst with Credit Agricole in New York. ''The company hasn't given investors much assurance or confidence. It's like they're in the twilight zone.''
As the chief executive of the largest bank in the country, Mr. Moynihan is under increasing pressure from Wall Street to raise his profile and rebuild his company's battered image. ''Given some of the problems the company has had, he's got to show shareholders that he's standing up for Bank of America,'' said Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst with Credit Suisse.
Unfortunately, that doesn't come easily to Mr. Moynihan. Unlike Jamie Dimon, who has become a media darling as the head of the nation's second-largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, and has sidestepped some of the withering criticisms aimed at Bank of America, Mr. Moynihan isn't fond of the spotlight.
''Jamie is visible, he's a brand, and he gets much more of the benefit of the doubt than Brian,'' says Christopher Whalen, managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics. ''Brian still has to prove that he can ride the tiger at Bank of America.''
EVEN as his company was battered by one bad headline after another over the last 12 months, Mr. Moynihan rarely wavered from his script, sticking to his calls for better ''execution'' and a ''customer focus.'' The problem is that lengthy accounts of robo-signers, lost documents and other foreclosure imbroglios hardly sound like smart execution to furious customers.
''He's got to get out there and become an equally large public figure as Jamie and articulate the bank's position,'' says D. Anthony Plath, an associate professor of finance at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. ''He's a hard worker and he's well liked inside the bank. But the way they are handling it now just won't work.''
Within the company, Mr. Moynihan gets credit for prying open Bank of America's rigid and top-down corporate culture and pressing the flesh with clients. Still, that side of Mr. Moynihan, a lawyer by training, doesn't always come through in public settings. His detractors compare him to Charles O. Prince III, the general counsel at Citigroup who proved unable to adequately manage that sprawling juggernaut after he was promoted to chief executive in 2003.
That's not a fair comparison, says Laurence D. Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, a money-management giant that was partially owned by Bank of America until last month, when Mr. Moynihan sold off most of that stake in an effort to raise capital and focus on the company's core banking business.
''There's always skepticism hiring a lawyer as C.E.O.,'' Mr. Fink says. ''He's facing enormous headwinds, but in the first year Brian has surprised a lot of those skeptics.''
Mr. Moynihan has, indeed, put out a series of fires -- settling a Securities and Exchange Commission suit against the company, mending ties with regulators and hinting last week that a dividend increase is coming soon.
He has also eliminated much-maligned overdraft fees on debit cards, strengthened the bank's balance sheet and sold off $16 billion worth of businesses that didn't serve core customers. On Wall Street, the combined Bank of America and Merrill Lynch has emerged as a global powerhouse, helping the company earn $9.4 billion so far this year.
But if Mr. Moynihan can't get a handle on the foreclosure furor and restore the company's reputation as a fair-minded lender, his wins will continue to be drowned out, according to interviews with analysts, industry experts and former Bank of America executives.
The problem facing Bank of America is stunning, both on an economic and on a human scale. Among its 14 million mortgage customers, nearly 1 in 10 is past due. Another 190,000 have not been able to make a payment in at least two years, and one-third of the homes facing foreclosure are vacant, making them harder to maintain and sell. Dealing with customer service, many homeowners say, is frequently infuriating.
A report that the Moody's Corporation issued on Thursday found that, when it comes to resolving delinquent subprime loans, Bank of America had taken longer than the other six major servicers examined.
''Bank of America has a lot more to clean up than any other servicer or lender,'' says Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. ''And customers find themselves facing a bureaucracy where it's hard to get answers, hard to understand what they're telling you and certainly hard to get solutions.''
Nor has the company signaled its path out, experts say. ''If this is truly the biggest bank, they should be a leader, out in front,'' says Mark Williams, executive-in-residence at Boston University and a former bank examiner for the Federal Reserve. ''But they're still in defense mode.''
Mr. Moynihan's predecessors, Hugh McColl and Ken Lewis, were classic empire builders who, during banking's boom years, transformed a sleepy North Carolina financial institution, NCNB, into the nation's largest bank through a never-ending series of deals. But in the end, Bank of America had swallowed much more than it could digest, leaving it stuffed with an unwieldy collection of assets and dangerously exposed to any economic downturns.
Mr. Lewis's final acquisition, Merrill Lynch, fulfilled his longstanding dream of becoming a banker to Wall Street and Main Street, and promised to prove to the elite banks in New York that a bunch of bankers from Charlotte could be every bit as successful as they were. Yet all he ended up showing, most analysts concur, was that he was every bit as poor at risk management as most of the Manhattan bankers.
The Merrill deal proved to be Mr. Lewis's undoing, saddling Bank of America with tens of billions in losses even as the red ink began to flow from another of his errant purchases: the mortgage lending giant Countrywide Financial. By the time Mr. Lewis resigned in 2009, several outside executives had made it clear they didn't want his job, and it fell to Mr. Moynihan to impose some kind of strategy on the sprawling empire.
Today, Bank of America's customers range from millions of subprime borrowers barely hanging on to their homes to the swells who bank with U.S. Trust, where the minimum deposit required to open an account is $3 million. Its 300,000-strong work force includes the ''thundering herd'' of some 15,000 brokers from Merrill, and 55,000 mortgage workers who help service one in five American home loans.
''This is a behemoth,'' Mr. Williams says. ''But I have no idea where Bank of America is going.''
MR. MOYNIHAN appears to be scarcely aware that his anniversary is upon him. ''We are working that day, right?'' he points out. ''I don't have any special things planned. My mother asked me what day it was, and I couldn't remember whether it was the 16th or 17th.'' (It's the 16th.)
Then again, it might just be an uncomfortable reminder of the selection process that led to his appointment in the fall of 2009, when the bank was rudderless for two and a half months after Mr. Lewis resigned and the board mulled over different candidates. Initially, directors looked at an outside choice, Robert P. Kelly, chief executive of Bank of New York Mellon, but that foundered after it became clear that it would be expensive to lure him away.
Ken Lewis had poked fun at Mr. Prince, says one former executive who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, and joked that he would never turn the company over to a lawyer. But Mr. Lewis, who declined to comment for this article, had not groomed a successor.
Mr. Moynihan's internal rivals had troubles of their own. One of them, Greg Curl, then the chief risk officer, was a strategist behind the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide, both of which had turned into money pits.
Mr. Moynihan, on the other hand, didn't carry much baggage. An Ohio native and former rugby player who graduated from Brown University and Notre Dame Law School, he initially made his mark in New England in the 1990s, quickly working his way up from associate general counsel at Fleet bank to run corporate strategy.
At Fleet, Mr. Moynihan was a leading member of the so-called Nifty 50, a group of young executives who had been identified as up and comers, recalls Bill Mutterperl, who served as Fleet's general counsel and was Mr. Moynihan's first boss. ''He's indefatigable in terms of being a hard worker, putting in incredible hours, focusing and never losing attention,'' Mr. Mutterperl says.
He also played a central role in Fleet's own expansion. ''On many deals he knew how to find the bodies that were buried and really do the due diligence,'' Mr. Mutterperl says. ''He is a real fixer.''
Mr. Moynihan was one of the few Fleet executives to survive when Bank of America acquired it in 2004, becoming president of the combined company's global wealth and investment management business. He stabilized that unit, in which mutual fund managers had run afoul of regulators over trading practices, and then switched over to run Bank of America's global corporate and investment bank in 2007.
Mr. Moynihan remained based in Boston, however, raising his three children in the suburbs and making it a point to be there for soccer games and birthday parties. His distance from Charlotte would actually turn out to be crucial when the top job opened up.
Amid the tumult caused by the merger with Merrill, Mr. Moynihan managed to hang on, cycling through four top jobs in 2008 and 2009, stepping in as other executives quit or were fired. He served for less than two months as general counsel, moving on to run corporate and investment banking and wealth management in January 2009, only to shift to running the consumer bank in August 2009. By December, he was chief executive.
''The good news was that he'd seen a lot of the businesses,'' says Mr. Mayo, the analyst at Credit Agricole. ''The downside is that he wasn't in any position for that long, making it much harder to evaluate his track record.''
Charles O. Holliday Jr., Bank of America's chairman, admits that ''nobody likes to move an executive after four months. But this guy was a proven quantity who could hit the ground running and produce results quickly.''
Others say Mr. Moynihan gets the job done without complaining or spending too much time analyzing the unforgiving messes he has frequently had to clean up.
''It's really interesting how we got here, but it's completely unimportant to where we go next,'' Mr. Moynihan says. ''You got to sit there and say, 'Do I want to be part of the team? Yes.' Then go do your job.''
IF Mr. Moynihan didn't have time to settle into the myriad jobs he had before becoming chief executive, it also meant he avoided blame for the losses piling up at Merrill and for the controversial decision to hand out billions in bonuses to Merrill's employees shortly before the deal closed in the beginning of 2009.
Unlike Countrywide, Merrill is now paying off for the company. In the first nine months of the year, Bank of America's investment bank, wealth management and capital markets units earned $6.7 billion, or well over half the company's overall profits. In businesses like leveraged finance, equity underwriting and investment banking, the combination of two middle-tier players has created a powerhouse.
''It took a long while for people to agree with us,'' Mr. Moynihan says about Merrill. ''You're seeing the power of the franchise come through. It was a terrific transaction.''
David Darnell, the head of commercial banking, says his unit has received 10,000 leads from the former Merrill. ''This is working,'' he says. ''Merrill is a game-changer in my business.''
But what about Countrywide?
''A decision was made; I wasn't running the company,'' Mr. Moynihan says, although he was obviously a top bank official at the time. ''Our company bought it and we'll stand up; we'll clean it up.''
Countrywide has already cost Bank of America more than $5 billion in write-offs. But Mr. Moynihan might be the last man standing when it comes to defending the merits of the deal.
''When we get through the work on the management side, people will come to the same conclusion that this is a great thing for customers and a great thing for the bank,'' he says. ''Right now, we're still absorbing the body blows.''
There's no sign that those body blows will stop anytime soon. Nearly all of Bank of America's subprime mortgage portfolio was inherited from Countrywide, whose risky lending typified the giddy years before the housing bubble burst.
Countrywide also saddled Bank of America with many more homeowners in default than its system could possibly handle. The overload contributed heavily to the consumer abuses and dubious legal practices that led it to halt foreclosures across the country in October, after the news media, courts and regulators began questioning the bank's operations.
Mr. Moynihan remains reluctant to yield much ground on Bank of America's foreclosure practices, however.
''At the end of the day, we could have done better. I'll take constructive criticism,'' he says, especially on delays as the caseload exploded. Still, with the number of workers focusing on defaults set to hit 30,000 by early next year -- triple what the bank had two years ago -- he says he's ''satisfied that we are doing everything we can and that we've caught up and are working through the backlog.''
''This is a very, very difficult process,'' he adds. ''People want to pay us their debt, but they're sick, they've lost their job, they've lost their income. It's a very tough scenario to have a good outcome for anybody.''
In-house mortgage modifications, the process in which the terms of a loan are eased so homeowners have a chance to catch up, have been a source of contention between the banking industry and its critics.
Mr. Moynihan points out that the scale of Bank of America's modification efforts far exceeds those of his competitors -- 725,000 modifications since January 2008 -- and is expanding fast. He says the rate of monthly modifications jumped to 22,400 in November from 12,700 in September.
''I feel proud of what we've done,'' he says. ''You never want to have a customer feel something wasn't done right.''
But with more than 1.3 million of its customers still behind on their mortgage payments, even tens of thousand of modifications a month still represents a small portion of the loans.
Other numbers also tell a less rosy story. For homeowners who failed to get a permanent modification under the federal government's Home Affordable Modification Program, only 14 percent managed to get an alternative in-house modification at Bank of America, compared with 31 percent at JPMorgan Chase, 27 percent at Citibank and 40 percent at Wells Fargo.
And of the 425,000 homeowners serviced by Bank of America estimated to be eligible for the program at the end of September, only 0.7 percent began trial modifications in October, according to federal data. That compares with 2.4 percent at JPMorgan Chase, 1 percent at Citibank and 1.6 percent at Wells Fargo.
''Bank of America has just had a culture of being more reluctant to make concessions as part of the modification process,'' said Alan White, associate professor of law at Valparaiso University in Indiana. ''It's improving slowly, but they continue to lag their peers.''
Bank of America says that the government's modification program is a limited benchmark for measuring its progress, and its overall record on modifications is hampered by Countrywide's subprime-heavy portfolio.
While the bank may be making progress, the overall picture Mr. Moynihan paints still doesn't reflect reality, says Rachel Bloch, a foreclosure prevention advocate at Empowering and Strengthening Ohio's People, a Cleveland community organization that helps borrowers with troubled mortgages stay in their homes.
''I've been working with Bank of America for three years now, and it's been a really hard process,'' she says. ''I have homeowners waiting for a year just to get an update, let alone a resolution.'' Over and over again, she said, the paperwork sent in by borrowers is lost, causing further delays, while fees and penalties accumulate.
It's a problem cited by other consumer advocates and homeowners like Dorothy Robinson of San Jose, Calif. Ms. Robinson, 66, has been trying to get a modification from Bank of America on her $476,000 mortgage for the last two years, ever since her husband lost his job.
But dealing with customer service has been incredibly frustrating, she says, with one bank representative telling her she'd been denied, another saying the modification had been approved, and both of them repeatedly asking for documents she'd already sent in. And when Ms. Robinson withdrew money from her retirement account to try to get caught up, it took months for Bank of America to even record the payment, she says.
''I have to get this resolved. I need a roof over my head,'' says Ms. Robinson. ''I don't know what's happening.''
Bank of America says Ms. Robinson has been conditionally approved for a modification under the government program, including a principal reduction. More information is still needed from Ms. Robinson to confirm final eligibility for the modification, the bank says, while denying that there is any systematic problem causing documents to be lost.
BAD as the foreclosure mess has been for Bank of America's reputation, Wall Street analysts say a bigger financial threat is looming: what if Bank of America and other giants are forced to buy back a portion of the hundreds of billions in mortgages gone bad?
A growing number of investors are arguing that because the mortgages may have been originated fraudulently, or sliced into mortgage-backed securities without adequate due diligence, the banks are obligated to buy them back under the original terms of the securities -- a process known as a putback.
Legal barriers to putbacks are high, but the sheer amount of mortgages originated, securitized and sold to all investors by Bank of America and Countrywide is staggering -- $2.1 trillion from 2004 to 2008.
So even if only a small portion are put back, some analysts argue, the losses for banks could run into the tens of billions. This is one issue on which Mr. Moynihan and Charles H. Noski, the chief financial officer, have made a more forceful case that the risk is ''manageable,'' promising ''hand-to-hand combat'' in the courts on a loan-by-loan basis if putbacks start cascading in.
But analysts like Mr. Mayo cite fear of putbacks as one reason Bank of America's stock has lagged behind its main rivals. ''People are worried about a $35 billion hit,'' Mr. Mayo says. ''That may be wrong, but they haven't convinced people otherwise.''
Mr. Moynihan is unbowed. ''We signed up for the task, and we'll clean it up,'' he says. ''We're working our tails off.''

HEADLINE: For Local Hiring Law to Succeed, Plenty of Cooperation Is Required

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEBER. 
Jonathan Weber is the editor in chief of The Bay Citizen. jweber@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Jonathan Weber writes a regular column for The Bay Citizen.
With ''buy local'' becoming a mantra among those who think about improving their communities' well-being, it's no surprise that ''hire local'' efforts would be gaining steam as well.
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors gave initial approval last week to legislation that will eventually require 50 percent of all work on city-financed construction projects to go to San Francisco residents -- the strongest such law in the country. It seems like a straightforward step to boost the city's economy, but the thicket of political, social, financial and philosophical issues surrounding the measure is dense, indeed. 
Its author, Supervisor John Avalos, has gotten high marks for nuance and for building broad support, but the implementation will take a lot of care if the policy is to succeed.
From a strictly economic view, tying jobs to residency makes little sense, especially in a place like San Francisco. Such requirements make the labor market less flexible -- never a good thing from the perspective of mainstream economists -- and San Francisco is a relatively small city that's the hub of a very large labor market.
Any job that goes to a San Francisco resident does not go to a resident of a neighboring Bay Area community, and thus is a wash for the regional economy. To look at it another way, if every city in the region had such a law, the positive economic impact for any individual municipality would be nil, but the inefficiencies in the market would raise costs for everyone. A reciprocity provision in the San Francisco law would treat workers from other jurisdictions with local-hire rules as locals. But if such laws were universal, they would have no impact.
It's also the case that these requirements cost money. The original version of the San Francisco legislation would have increased expenditures by $9.3 million annually, according to a city analysis, because contractors might have to pay more if they're drawing their workers from a smaller pool, or pay penalties if they don't hit the local hiring targets. (The administrative costs add up as well.) Changes to the legislation have brought that number down, though it's not clear by how much.
Perhaps the most complicated dimension of all this is that construction jobs on city projects in a union town are not entirely controlled by the contractors. The unions also have a lot of say, and they will bear much of the burden of finding qualified city-dwelling workers. Not surprisingly, the unions have tended to support or oppose the legislation depending on how much of their membership lives in town.
And that brings us to the nub of the issue. The initiative is not really about local hiring; it's about creating opportunities for unemployed people from low-income neighborhoods. The legislation mandates that half the local hires be ''disadvantaged workers.''
A group called Aboriginal Blackmen United has had some success in demanding jobs for residents of the economically depressed neighborhoods where some of the largest city projects are being developed -- notably Bayview-Hunters Point. In doing so, it has at times run head-on into unions, protesting at construction sites to demand jobs.
Ken Jacobs, chairman of the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Berkeley, said the key to local-hire efforts is to have a pathway for the people whom they are really supposed to help. The San Francisco law requires that half of all building trade apprenticeships go to local residents as of next month; the full 50 percent local-hire rule will be phased in over seven years. For that to happen, the unions will need to play ball.
With the city planning to directly spend about $10 billion on public works over the next decade, there is a baseline logic in trying to use that spending to help those who have been hurt most by the recession.
But the local-hiring mandate will work only if everyone -- the city, the unions, the contractors and the aspiring workers -- gets behind the idea of using construction projects as a tool of social policy. Ideally, hundreds of low-income San Franciscans will get stable, middle-class jobs in the construction trades. But safety-valve provisions in the legislation could invite mischief, and leave city taxpayers with higher bills and not much more.

HEADLINE: Lessons for a Modern City Found in Success Stories From Abroad

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
If Chicago's mayoral candidates had made it to the sprightly U.I.C. Forum last week, they would have found simple insights for the future amid the 36-foot-tall moveable partitions that hang from 124-foot trusses on the otherwise bleak concrete campus.
Scurrying about were hundreds of public officials, planners, philanthropists, educators and businessmen from around the world at a Global Metro Summit convened by the London School of Economics, Washington's Brookings Institution and the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank. 
The two-day gathering was as important as it was uncovered by the news media. At a minimum, it was an affirmation of Chicago's underappreciated ascension into the upper ranks of world cities, with Mayor Richard M. Daley treated like a star athlete on a farewell tour. ''For all of us, he's the standard,'' said Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa of Los Angeles.
But the event's real importance was as a primer on modern cities, a cautionary note about how we're losing our standing and mojo. It also offered a lesson on soaring successes like Barcelona, Munich, Seoul and Turin, which have melded long-term vision with regional cooperation we seem incapable of matching.
An estimated 70 percent of the world's population will live in cities by 2050. The fittest to survive, the consensus goes, are those metropolitan areas -- not just cities -- that can combine talent, capital, innovation and cooperation in plotting organic strategies for growth, and not just steal businesses from elsewhere.
Bruce Katz, a Brookings vice president and an intellectual catalyst for the metro-centered thesis, opened by citing a visit to the damaged south suburban towns of Riverdale, Harvey, Blue Island and Crestwood, where he glimpsed ''a microcosm of a failed economy and failed economic policy.''
Speculation and financial chicanery had triumphed, said Mr. Katz, a brainy and theatrical former government official who resembles a chunkier Woody Allen. ''The devastation I saw will not change until we change the course of our economy'' to emphasize exports and production, innovation and low carbon emissions, or ''green'' technology.
A new ranking of metropolitan economies, based on employment and per-capita income growth, shows American cities plummeting as Asian and Latin American cities rise. In the past year, only one American city, Austin, Tex., was in the top 35, with Chicago ranking 82nd among 150 metro economies worldwide and trailing 30 cities in the United States.
Panels exploring the revivals of Barcelona, Munich, Seoul and Turin underscored that success involved a determination to work with local, state and federal governments; to internationalize economies; to innovate to revitalize traditional industries; to upgrade workers' skills with technical training; and to shift to a green economy while boosting investment in high-speed rail.
Munich, for example, was down in the dumps in the early 1990s, creamed by recession, a declining demand for its defense and aerospace industries at the Cold War's end, and German reunification, which threatened a shift of population.
With help from the state government, Munich raised huge sums from investors and spent the money on infrastructure and eight polytechnic colleges. It helped 450 high-tech start-ups, all supported by collaboration among researchers, companies and venture capital. The ''Munich Mix'' of industry and companies like Siemens and BMW is envied. And it's a neat place to live.
Dozens of cases were shared and debated, with doses of cold reality offered by the likes of Ronald J. Daniels, president of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He found Mr. Katz's prescriptions bracing, but not fully sensitive to his city's bedeviling underclass, which is characterized by what he termed ''malaise and despair.''
Still, most American participants envied the international tales, while worrying that our elected officials are often tragically, if unavoidably, lost in the weeds. Too often, they become re-election-obsessed tactical minimalists focused on budget messes with no overarching strategy of where their regions must go beyond their tenures in office.
Emily J. Harris, program director for Chicago Metropolis 2020, found the big takeaway from the conference was that economic development strategy must depend on innovation ''and not trying to attract firms from elsewhere.'' Growth must come from within, the strategy used in Turin, Italy's Detroit, which parlayed a declining auto sector's technical savvy into powerhouse design and aerospace centers.
Mark Muro, a Brookings planning expert, said that in the absence of government investment, like that made in Europe and Asia, smart American metro areas, like Seattle, have designed regional transformation plans with impressive private and nonprofit collegiality, ''rather than simply beg for aid through the usual siloed channels.''
Can the next Chicago mayor think big, beyond the city's borders? Like Mr. Daley, the next mayor would be smart to get out of town sometimes to find inspiration.

HEADLINE: On the Billionaires' Flyway

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
Miami Beach
AFTER the last multimillion-dollar Yves Klein painting was crated for shipping, the last private Cessna Citation Ultra had lifted off from Opa-locka Executive Airport, the last glasses from the last dinner party at the W Hotel had been cleared and the last of the 46,000 or more people that descended on a convention center on this glorified sand spit for one highly specialized event had departed, one question remained.
What is Art Basel Miami Beach precisely? Is it merely an art-world trade fair, one of scores now scheduled in succession across the planet? Is it, like much else in Miami Beach, just another over-hyped cross-platform marketing opportunity? Is it a pre-Christmas break for global billionaires?
If, as Silvia Venturini Fendi, the Fendi designer, remarked one afternoon at the Standard hotel here, contemporary art collecting is the ''new shopping,'' then is it not possible that art fairs like Art Basel Miami Beach are in some sense the new malls? As at malls, there are boutique dealers at Art Basel Miami Beach and key anchor tenants and also a food court, albeit one that sells flutes of Champagne. There is an ambient aura of humming prosperity that masks, but just barely, the giddy excitement sparked when people in an acquisitive frame of mind move in packs. 
Art fairs emerged in the last decade as an irresistible phenomenon, said Ms. Fendi, who annually sponsors a booth and a design project at Design Miami, an applied-arts fair that piggybacks on Art Basel Miami Beach, ''because everybody wants to be a follower, to have the same collection, and to follow the trends.''
Collecting vogues are certainly on view at Art Basel Miami Beach ''I tell all my collectors to look at Baselitz again,'' Kim Heirston Evans, a prominent art adviser, remarked at a dinner hosted at the Soho Beach House by Stefano Tonchi, the editor of ''W'' magazine. Ms. Evans was referring to the German neo-expressionist whose cachet, which crested in the late 1980s, is on the rise again, if one can judge from the prominence afforded Baselitz pictures at booths like that of the dealer Michael Werner, where an abstract by the painter, offered for $750,000, was sold for an undisclosed but purportedly much higher sum.
Perhaps more important, though, the fair provides a viewing platform for observing the evolving folkways of that restricted, migratory species that has increasingly come to dominate wealth around the world.
Over the course of the near-decade since the Miami fair made its debut -- one year after a planned inaugural edition was scuttled by the 9/11 attacks -- this local version of a storied but sober contemporary-arts trade fair held since 1970 in Basel, Switzerland, has offered the opportunity to observe the rampant growth of a once-rarefied activity that just three decades ago was dominated by a small group of collectors and dealers as though it were their own club.
''Everybody knew each other,'' said the dealer Angela Westwater, referring to the long-ago 1970s, when she entered the art world on the ground floor, working at the John Weber gallery in a fabled SoHo gallery building at 420 West Broadway. ''Not only was it a smaller, more cohesive scene then, but it mixed artists, dancers, sculptors, painters,'' Ms. Westwater said. ''It wasn't a fancy scene.''
NOW, in keeping with the altered rules of the game, Ms. Westwater's Sperone Westwater gallery operates from an eight-story building on the Bowery designed by Norman Foster to her precise specifications. And now, her competition is no longer derived from a select group of downtown familiars but from an almost bewildering roster of players operating on an international stage.
Over 260 dealers took booths at this year's Art Basel Miami Beach, nearly 40 percent more than were on the roster in the first year of the fair. The most tabloid-famous among them is undoubtedly Larry Gagosian, a gargantuan persona whose big bets and global aspirations have elicited references to him as a ''super dealer.''
Yet the droves that descend on Miami Beach the week of the fair carrying suitcases of euros, pounds and yuan are not destined only for Mr. Gagosian's booth. And they are not limited to home-grown billionaires like the hedge-fund investor Steven A. Cohen, whose budget for art acquisition sometimes seems to rival the G.D.P. of certain small nations. (And whose SAC Capital Advisors recently was served with a broad subpoena from federal authorities investigating insider trading on Wall Street.)
A generation of the new rich from countries like India, Russia, China and Brazil have also gotten in on an activity once pursued largely by wealthy American collectors so discreet that their names seldom appeared in art business journals, let alone gossip columns -- people like Burton and Emily Tremaine, Virginia and Bagley Wright or Victor and Sally Ganz, whose collection, quietly amassed over a half-century and for under $2 million, was sold at auction by Christie's at the end of 1997 for $206.5 million, at the time the largest sum ever realized for a single-owner sale of modern art.
That was pre-crash, of course, and yet one of the startling aspects of Art Basel Miami Beach is how resilient the market has proved, how irresistible it remains as a game for those who treat collecting contemporary art as a kind of varsity sport.
''In the past, rich people never talked about what they bought,'' Aby Rosen, the German-born real estate tycoon, said at an Art Basel Miami Beach dinner that he and his wife, the psychiatrist Samantha Boardman, hosted for their art world friends at the Solea restaurant in the W hotel. ''Now it's totally different,'' Mr. Rosen said.
The Old World custom of hushed consultations in the back rooms of a gallery seems as dated and Jamesian as to be quaint. At fairs like Art Basel Miami Beach, Mr. Rosen suggested, with no excess of modesty, ''the three most important worlds in the culture right now -- fashion, real estate and art -- are pulled together.''
NOT incidentally, the convergence provides for people like him, whose fortunes are derived from real estate, fashion and art, a pretext and a regular occasion to convene. ''It gives them a reason to use the jet,'' Sam Orlofsky, a director at the Gagosian Gallery, said at a dinner Mr. Gagosian and his fellow hosts, Wendi Murdoch, the wife of the media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and Dasha Zhukova, daughter and partner of Russian oligarchs, held for 220 close friends at Mr. Chow, a restaurant in the W hotel on Collins Avenue.
At Art Basel Miami Beach, the super-rich ''can socialize with people at their same level,'' Mr. Rosen added. It may be unnecessary to add that the level Mr. Rosen was alluding to is one so stratospheric as to hover far above hoi polloi, with their mundane worries about jobs or paying the mortgage or preserving niceties of middle class existence like Social Security.
The rich at Art Basel Miami Beach attend the fair, among other reasons, because it is there that they can guiltlessly converse with friends whose annual purchasing budgets for art may be set at $30 million -- as is the case for one Latin American heiress -- or else apparently without any ceiling, as with Mr. Cohen, the hedge fund mogul, who once reportedly paid $137.5 million for a single seminal Willem de Kooning piece, ''Woman III.''
''Only a tiny percentage of people at the fair are actually doing most of the buying,'' Louise Neri, a critic and curator, said at a party whose host was Nadja Swarovksi, the crystals magnate, and that was held on the rooftop terrace of the Soho Beach House. ''Probably 99 percent of the people here do not buy art.''
The remaining 1 percent can openly preen about newly acquired treasures at Art Basel Miami Beach, as Mr. Orlofsky of the Gagosian Gallery noted. ''They can buy and brag about'' works acquired as early as 11 last Wednesday morning when, just after the show opened to holders of V.I.P. cards granting early admission, collectors sprinted to booths run by galleries like Lehmann Maupin and spent over $300,000 there on works by artists including Tony Oursler, Tracey Emin, Adriana Varejao, Mickalene Thomas and Angel Otero
Business art, Andy Warhol once wrote, is the best art. What Warhol, whose works never fetched anywhere near their current market prices during his lifetime, could not have anticipated is exactly what good business ''business art'' can be.
''Art has tremendous asset potential,'' said Mr. Rosen, the real estate mogul. ''All the other luxuries depreciate, and art is one thing that has the potential to appreciate.''
At Art Basel Miami Beach, collectors not only have unusually ready access to the pulse of the market but the freedom to go trophy-hunting in public, an ineffable pleasure often lost when art business is conducted in the privacy of a gallery office or by telephone.
Mathias Rastorfer, a director of the Zurich-based Galerie Gmurzynska, said that a fairgoer bought a sponge and synthetic resin Yves Klein work from 1960 called ''SE 250.'' The Galerie Gmurzynska booth, designed by Zaha Hadid, had pride of place, right at the entrance to the fair, and bragging rights on particularly big-ticket sales. ''We also sold the Yves Klein 'IKB 93,' blue pigment and synthetic resin laid on panel,'' Mr. Rastorfer added later in an e-mail. The asking price for that particular painting was $4.5 million, he said.
''Where else would you put your money, if you are still solvent and you are still buying?'' asked Beth Rudin DeWoody, a collector, philanthropist and regular at the fair. Yes, there are those who continue to collect art quietly and privately, Ms. DeWoody added. But the emergence of art collecting as communal activity for the ultra-rich comes with benefits that extend beyond the intimate pleasures to be derived from owning and contemplating a work of art.
''It's like if you're Jewish,'' said Ms. DeWoody, who is Jewish, referring to the migratory confraternity one encounters at Art Basel Miami Beach and other art fairs and biennales. ''Anywhere in the world you go,'' she said, ''you're always welcomed,'' by those who recognize you as a member of this particular jet-set tribe.
On opening day of the fair, Becca Cason Thrash -- a Texas socialite and art collector who, before marrying an heir to a natural-gas storage business, was a publicist for a high-end boutique called Tootsies -- darted from booth to booth, keeping an eye out for art and also for pals like Maria Asuncion Aramburuzabala Garza, one of the richest women in Mexico, who was at Art Basel Miami Beach hunting down works to hang in a new multistory penthouse she owns in Miami Beach.
''It's like a private club,'' Ms. Thrash said. ''We all collect art. We all love to travel. We all love being together on the circuit. You see your friends and it's like, 'Same time, next fair.' ''

HEADLINE: Staffs Worry About Shifts In County Health System

BYLINE: By KARI LYDERSEN. 
Kari.lydersen@gmail.com

 BODY:
As Tia Speat strode through the quiet halls of Oak Forest Hospital last week passing out fliers about the nurses union's contract negotiations with Cook County officials, angry nurses accosted her with questions and complaints about proposed cuts in service and staff.
As the county health system shifts strategy to deliver care with leaner resources, many who provide medical services say they are approaching a breaking point. An analysis by the nurses union predicted that the county health system's 2011 budget would cut about 1,000 jobs, including 114 nurses and 19 doctors, to help close a $487 million countywide budget gap.
After the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved staff reductions and closed eight clinics in 2007, an independent board was appointed to oversee the health system. Toni Preckwinkle, the newly elected County Board president, said ''the system was hacked with an ax'' during that round of cuts, and she has been an outspoken supporter of the independent board, which recently submitted its budget to her. 
The budget is based on a plan called Vision 2015, which the independent board adopted last summer. The plan is designed to shape budgets and operations over the next five years, shifting the focus of the health system to primary-care service from inpatient care. Because the new plan sets out an overall strategy, Ms. Preckwinkle has said, the pending staff reductions will be more in line with long-range goals and less painful.
Lucio Guerrero, a spokesman for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, said: ''We're cutting superexpensive services that are underutilized and adding services that are needed in the communities. This isn't just an exercise in the bottom line; this is a medical model that makes sense for the next five years.''
''I don't blame people for not really trusting us,'' Mr. Guerrero added. ''Maybe in the past they didn't have a reason to. With the independent board, it's a different day.''
Under Vision 2015, emergency and inpatient services at Oak Forest Hospital will be eliminated, and at Provident Hospital in Bronzeville inpatient care will be greatly scaled back, meaning that many of the sickest patients from the South Side and south suburbs will have to travel to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County on the West Side. The cuts would be offset by increases in primary care and outpatient services at Oak Forest, Provident and Stroger and county clinics.
Many nurses are not convinced that the plan is workable. The layoffs will most likely be heaviest at Oak Forest, where nurses said staffing levels had been winnowed to bare-bones levels. They are already hard-pressed to give adequate attention to patients, the nurses said.
If county officials are going to close inpatient units, ''they should just do it, instead of expecting us to work miracles in a horrible situation,'' said Kathy McKinney, a registered nurse. ''I'm just tired. I still love my career, but I dread coming to work at this place.''
The County Board's finance committee will begin deliberations on the budget Tuesday.
The health system, like all county departments, was ordered to trim 21 percent from last year's budget, even as federal aid was being reduced. Doctors and nurses say the budget squeeze could not come at a worse time, with rising unemployment producing an influx of newly uninsured patients.
On Dec. 22, the National Nurses Organizing Committee, which represents 1,300 registered nurses in the county health system, will tally the results of a mail-in vote that would authorize union leaders to call a strike to protest the staffing cuts and other concerns. Administrators at Stroger Hospital, the largest institution in the health system, have prepared a contingency plan that would include early release or transfer of patients to other hospitals, cancellation of elective surgery, mandatory 12-hour shifts and other measures.
The Service Employees International Union's Doctors Council, which represents 500 county doctors, is also in the midst of contract negotiations. In a recent report, it described the county system as ''cut to the bone.''
Despite bureaucratic obstacles and long emergency room waits for patients -- some reportedly as long as 14 hours at Stroger -- the county's health care system has long been known for its top-notch specialists and services. ''You'll die waiting at county, but then they'll bring you back to life,'' goes a popular saying.
Quentin Young, chairman of Cook County's Department of Medicine from 1972 to 1981, called Stroger ''a spectacular place that has provided care for millions.'' Now, Mr. Young and other experts say, the system's challenge is to cut costs while maintaining a high standard of care.
Mr. Young supports the independent board's plan to cut emergency and inpatient services in favor of expanded primary and outpatient care. ''Any kind of cut is painful,'' he said. ''They're trying to choose between the lesser of two evils.''
Doctors and nurses say they fear that the sickest, most vulnerable South Side and suburban patients who had relied on Provident and Oak Forest will fall through the cracks in an efficiency-driven corporate model. They say they are being pressured to increase the numbers of patients they see, which gives them less time to spend with each one.
''There is a business mentality that exists on the board now,'' said Dr. Fred Martin, a family medicine residency supervisor. ''They don't have a good feel for what's happening on the front lines. The only measure of productivity that we have is numbers of patients seen. The consultants have not been taking into consideration that a doctor might see a 62-year-old diabetic with thyroid disease, hypertension -- and, oh, his back hurts, also. We need to spend time with people like that. He's not just a number.''
At Stroger Hospital, nurses say they worry about the expected increase in seriously ill patients after changes in inpatient and emergency services at Provident and Oak Forest. Dennis Kosuth, an emergency room nurse at Stroger, said administrators had demanded that nurses provide better customer service, even though they were taking care of up to nine patients at a time -- 18 when their partners are on breaks.
''The best customer service attitude in the world doesn't help when you just have too many patients,'' Mr. Kosuth said. ''We give the best care we can with the resources we have, but an overcrowded emergency room where people are waiting 12 hours is a disaster waiting to happen.''
An analysis by David Goldberg, a Stroger doctor and president of the executive medical staff, said previous cuts in service had been financially self-defeating. With each dollar of services cut in 2007, the study showed, revenue -- from fewer potential patients -- dropped by $1.62 in 2008. Dr. Goldberg said many patients might have given up on the county system after the 2007 cuts and gone without care or found other options, causing a drop in reimbursement from Medicaid and health insurers.
County officials and taxpayers should be willing to spend more on the health system, he said.
''We're doing our part to support the work force and the residents of Cook County by caring for all these people,'' Dr. Goldberg said. ''We need a county who stands behind us. If everyone's going to walk away from us, that's not a society I'm proud of.''

HEADLINE: Hoop Dreams of His Own Design

BYLINE: By DOROTHY SPEARS

 BODY:
Los Angeles
OF the opportunities once facing Mark Bradford, who is 6 foot 8, hoop dreams were probably among the more viable ones.
In the mid-1970s Mr. Bradford, then a teenager, shocked everyone -- including himself -- by growing 10 inches in a single summer. Strangers on the streets here in his hometown kept badgering him with unsolicited suggestions. ''They would say, 'If I were your height, I would be a basketball player and make a million dollars,' '' Mr. Bradford said in an interview in September at his studio.
Instead he became an apprentice in his mother's beauty shop. ''It was my first defiant act,'' he said. 
Now 49, Mr. Bradford has the physical stature and refined, fluid movements of an athlete. But the endpapers he once used for curling hair have since found their way into his abstract collages, with titles referring to musicians like Tupac Shakur and Smokey Robinson. These, along with his political, spoofy videos (in one he's in a Lakers-inspired purple-and-gold hoop skirt, attempting to dunk a basketball), and mammoth paintings made from layers of glued-together posters torn from the fences of abandoned lots near his studio, have earned Mr. Bradford a 2009 MacArthur grant. And a 10-year survey of his paintings, sculptures and video installations, organized by the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, has recently opened at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, where it will remain through March 13.
Yet even with the art world more or less at his feet, Mr. Bradford continues to challenge himself, changing the direction of his work almost as soon as a new idea gains traction because, as he explained, ''the stereotype is always following you, like a monkey on your back.'' And for every turn his work takes, he returns to this studio, where he finds the inspiration and the meditative equilibrium to dig even deeper.
Mr. Bradford's studio is in Leimert Park, in South Central, and includes two massive spaces -- a former bar and a former nightclub -- bisected by a deep, corridorlike area that once accommodated his mother's salon. Up front, beyond the shop's waiting area, was where Mr. Bradford once kept vigil. ''My mother thought it was important that, if someone came to the door and they were a little bit aggressive, they would see a man here,'' he said. He re-enacted his stock response to such situations, pretending to stick a hot curler in a stove. ''She used to say, it was kind of like letting them know, O.K., I've got a weapon.''
In one corner is a patch of peeling linoleum whose gridlike chipped layers echo the excavated surfaces of Mr. Bradford's paintings, a fusion of abstract patterns and fliers posted by local businesses offering cash for houses and hair, DNA testing and lawyers specializing in paternity suits.
On a wall decorative dabs evoking a spray of flowers reveal Mr. Bradford's untutored handiwork. ''My mother said the ladies getting their hair washed needed to have something nice to look at,'' he explained, adding that the flowers adorned an area of wall where he would repeatedly attempt to print the names of hair treatments and their prices in neat, even rows. ''I didn't have the ability to make it perfect,'' he said. His printing would always get smaller as he ran out of room.
This desire for compositional perfection, combined with his acceptance of inevitable human failure, continues to inform works like ''Pinocchio Is on Fire'' (2010), an installation now at the Institute of Contemporary Art, where Mr. Bradford has papered a gallery's walls with rows of black paper that run off course and overlap.
In the studio's main space the din of staple guns and table saws attested to the interest in Mr. Bradford's artwork. A shipment of paintings had just left for a solo gallery show in London; another monumental painting had recently been shipped to a biennial in Seoul, South Korea.
A small show, ''Alphabet,'' featuring 26 of his works, was soon opening at the Studio Museum in Harlem. (It is on view through March 13.) And his assistants were building a crate for a work in a group show, ''The Artist's Museum,'' at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art through Jan. 31. (The museum is to host a solo show of Mr. Bradford's new work in 2013.)
The museum director, Jeffrey Deitch, said by e-mail that Mr. Bradford's work ''is not just art about art; it is art about life.''
He brings ''the daily struggles of people left behind by the American economy into his paintings,'' Mr. Deitch said.
Mr. Bradford was raised by his mother, Janice Bradford, who now lives in Atlanta; he never met his father. From age 11, he remembers sitting in the back of the shop, styling wigs and going on deli runs for customers. At 13 he began apprenticing there. After high school, he said, his mother told him, ''I don't know what you're doing with your life, but while you're figuring that out, I could use a little help.''
In his late 20s, he began taking art classes at a junior college in Santa Monica California Institute of the Arts, in Valencia. Although he continued to work at the salon, he said, ''I thought I had something else in me.'' At 31 and taking Foundation 1, however, he said he was painfully aware that ''everyone else was 18.''
''And I was so much older, and so much taller,'' he said.
During the five years it took to complete his bachelor's and master's degrees at CalArts (he finished in 1997) the art world shifted. He said graduates were more focused on a market that favored their youth. ''Hot young 22-year-olds were settling in the artsy parts of town -- Silver Lake and Echo Park,'' Mr. Bradford said.
Meanwhile, he said, he was attracted to the paintings of Jackson Pollock and writings by the Abstract Expressionist guru Clement Greenberg, both out of fashion. ''I found myself wanting to be a part of the history of Abstract Expressionism,'' he said, ''and then at the same time rejecting a lot of what it stands for.''
For two years, Mr. Bradford spent five days a week making art and two days at the salon. Eventually he laid endpapers side by side onto his paintings. Works like ''Enter and Exit the New Negro'' (2000), combining the look of Agnes Martin's abstractions with materials relating to his mother's merchant background, earned him the respect of local art insiders, who tipped off Thelma Golden, the newly appointed director of the Studio Museum in Harlem. She included Mr. Bradford's collages in her 2001 show, ''Freestyle,'' spotlighting emerging artists. ''Mark's work is significant,'' she said, ''because it defines art practice in relation to himself and his history, and also in relation to aesthetics.''
Christopher Bedford, the organizer of Mr. Bradford's traveling survey and a chief curator for the Wexner, agreed. ''By investing in the cultural history of the area he lived in, Mark has elbowed his way into the conversation about midcentury abstract painting, without ever sacrificing its expressive quality,'' he said.
Mr. Bradford has since moved to using billboards, album covers and shredded paper. (He says paper is ''a metaphor for skin.'') Large-scale paintings like ''Method Man'' and ''James Brown is Dead'' continue to affirm his fascination with African-American commerce.
Still, during a tour of his show at the Wexner, Mr. Bradford appeared restless. Was all this waxing about torn-down posters reminding him of those dreaded stereotypes? And haven't stereotypes about race driven his art from the beginning?
They have, he agreed. After all, ''something black comes in the door,'' he said. ''Then something my height comes in the door. Then, finally, Mark is like, 'Hey, I'm here too.' ''

 BODY:
THE POLITICAL ISSUE As rising nations industrialize, they compete for resources, or use resource exports as bargaining chips in disputes. China does both 
RESOURCES IN PLAY Oil, rare earth minerals, fisheries, ocean zones for trade and seabed exploration
China is buying mineral concessions across Asia, Africa and Latin America; it has harassed foreign aircraft and ships to assert sovereignty beyond the accepted 12-mile limit in the South China Sea, whose bed is thought to be rich in rare metals.
China has risen, in less than 40 years, from a symbol of underdevelopment to the world's No. 2 economy, and the transformation has left a vast gulf between rich and poor. Its leaders' greatest fear is political instability, and so it seeks rapid growth to spread the benefits of the new wealth. But its voracious appetite for minerals has at times set it at odds with the West over policies toward countries like Sudan and Iran, whose oil it buys. China also has longstanding unresolved claims to islands nearby, and recently it hinted at withholding exports of rare earth minerals to get Japan to release a Chinese fishing captain who had been captured in disputed waters.
''The Chinese look at the most important thing to keep that growth going, and it is natural resources,'' said Vice Adm. Doug Crowder, a former commander of Navy forces in the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean.

HEADLINE: Burmese Couple Build Life in the Bronx

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MASCIA

 BODY:
Bae Reh and his wife, Moo Pro, were raised on a five-mile-long patch of land they were not permitted to leave, except to gather leaves to fortify the bamboo huts in which they slept. The couple had no knowledge of the outside world. They had never heard of America and certainly could not find it on a map. There were no newspapers, just a magazine and a television station, both operating under strict political control.
It sounds a little like a scene from North Korea. But Mr. Bae Reh and Ms. Moo Pro, both 27, did not grow up there. They are refugees from Myanmar whose parents fled to a camp in Thailand to escape a government that drafted citizens at random and forced them to commit atrocities against their own ethnic tribes. 
''We were told to fight, or to pay not to fight,'' Mr. Bae Reh said through an interpreter.
He does not remember life before Mae La, the largest of nine camps along the border in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Ms. Moo Pro arrived with her family when she was 12.
Although they were out of reach of the oppressive military regime, their life was not ideal. The Thai government did not allow refugees to work outside the camps. The United Nations provided sugar, beans, rice noodles, charcoal for cooking -- and, once a month, a protein, usually chicken.
Unable to study beyond high school or to work in any other capacity, Mr. Bae Reh and Ms. Moo Pro were drawn to teaching and lead a United Nations classroom housed in a tent. Ms. Moo Pro taught kindergarten, and it was there, presiding over 20 5-year-olds, that her future husband fell in love with her.
''She was so patient,'' he said, stealing a glance at his wife. They both giggled. They had two children at Mae La: Khem, 1, and Sukanya, 5.
In 2007, the American government began admitting some of the refugees. After a two-year investigation ensured that Mr. Bae Reh and Ms. Moo Pro had no health problems or messy political entanglements, they arrived in New York in March.
Freedom brought its challenges. They had never paid a bill or made a bed.
''They didn't even know where to put stuff,'' said Onita Misa , the family's case manager at Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven beneficiaries of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. ''They put food in the cabinet with detergent,'' she said. ''I had to start with the A B C's: 'Here is the toothbrush, here is the toothpaste.' ''
The organization was enlisted to help after being alerted to the family's plight by the State Department's Reception and Placement Program. Ms. Misa found an apartment for them in the West Farms section of the Bronx; it is below street level at the end of a dank outdoor hallway. The Neediest Cases Fund provided $900, which paid for their first month's rent. Ms. Misa filled out the rental paperwork and bought the essentials.
''It was amazing for them, compared to the camps,'' she said of the modest apartment, where the two children sleep in the only bedroom and their parents sleep on the couch. The couple's wedding photo dominates a wall in the living room: In it, Mr. Bae Reh is wearing blue jeans and a sports jacket over an untucked shirt, and Ms. Moo Pro has a youthful smile.
The only clothes they wear now are donated or bought for them from thrift stores. They have never been to Manhattan.
Ms. Moo Pro said she wanted to see the Statue of Liberty. ''But how can I go there?'' she said through an interpreter. ''I don't even know how to get there.''
Until she learns English, she is essentially unemployable. Mr. Bae Reh travels only to his job in Brooklyn -- he makes $7.25 an hour as a packer at the 4C Foods Corporation in East New York.
Money is extremely tight, but they are happy to be here. ''If they go back home, they will go to jail,'' their interpreter, the Rev. Anastasio Tarsio, said. A refugee himself, Father Tarsio said that though they were better off in New York, they yearn for Myanmar. ''All the refugees, they want to go back if Burma gets democracy,'' he said.

HEADLINE: No Jobs? Young Graduates Make Their Own

BYLINE: By HANNAH SELIGSON

 BODY:
FIVE years ago, after graduating from New York University with a film degree and thousands of dollars in student loans, Scott Gerber moved back in with his parents on Staten Island. He then took out more loans to start a new-media and technology company, but he didn't have a clear market in mind; the company went belly up in 2006.
''It made me feel demoralized and humiliated,'' he says. ''I wondered if this was really what post-collegiate life was supposed to be like. Did I do something wrong? The answers weren't apparent to me.''
Still in debt, Mr. Gerber considered his career options. His mother kept encouraging him to get a ''real'' job, the kind that comes with an office and a boss. But, using the last $700 in his bank account, he decided to start another company instead. 
With the new company, called Sizzle It, Mr. Gerber vowed to find a niche, reduce overhead and generally be more frugal. The company, which specializes in short promotional videos, was profitable the first year, he says.
Mr. Gerber, now 27, isn't a millionaire, but he's paid off his loans and doesn't have to live with his parents (he rents an apartment in Hoboken, N.J.). And he thinks his experience can help other young people who face a daunting unemployment rate.
In October, Mr. Gerber started the Young Entrepreneur Council ''to create a shift from a resume-driven society to one where people create their own jobs,'' he says. ''The jobs are going to come from the entrepreneurial level.''
The council consists of 80-plus business owners across the country, ages 17 to 33. Members include Scott Becker, 23, co-founder of Invite Media, an advertising technology firm recently acquired by a Google unit; Lauren Berger, 26, founder of the Intern Queen, a site that connects college students with internships; Aaron Patzer, the 30-year-old who sold Mint.com to Intuit for $170 million; and Josh Weinstein, 24, who started CollegeOnly.com, a social networking site that is backed by a PayPal founder.
The council, which has applied for nonprofit status, serves as a help desk and mentoring hotline for individual entrepreneurs. People can also submit questions on subjects like marketing, publicity and technology, and each month a group of council members will answer 30 to 40 of them in business publications like The Wall Street Journal and American Express Open Forum, and on dozens of small business Web sites.
Council members assert that young people can start businesses even if they have little or no money or experience. But whether those start-ups last is another matter. Roughly half of all new businesses fail within the first five years, according to federal data. And the entrepreneurial life is notoriously filled with risks, stresses and sacrifices.
But then again, unemployment is 9.8 percent; Mr. Gerber's in-box is flooded with e-mails from young people who have sent out hundreds of resumes for corporate jobs and come up empty. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, only 24.4 percent of 2010 graduates who applied for a job had one waiting for them after graduation (up from 19.7 percent in 2009). What do some people have to lose?
THE lesson may be that entrepreneurship can be a viable career path, not a renegade choice -- especially since the promise of ''Go to college, get good grades and then get a job,'' isn't working the way it once did. The new reality has forced a whole generation to redefine what a stable job is.
''I've seen all these people go to Wall Street, and those were supposed to be the good jobs. Now they are out of work,'' says Windsor Hanger, 22, who turned down a marketing position at Bloomingdale's to work on HerCampus.com, an online magazine. ''It's not a pure dichotomy anymore that entrepreneurship is risky and other jobs are safe, so why not do what I love?''
Mr. Gerber argues that the tools to become an entrepreneur are more accessible than they've ever been. Thanks to the Internet, there are fewer upfront costs. A business owner can build a Web site, host conference calls, create slide presentations online through a browser, and host live meetings and Web seminars -- all on a shoestring.
Can't afford a Madison Avenue address? Try borrowing one instead. That is what Mr. Gerber did, for $300 a year, from ManhattanVirtualOffice.com, which forwards mail from a recognizable address. He says it saved him $100,000 in rent and gave Sizzle It the credibility it needed to start attracting clients that now include Procter & Gamble and the Gap. He does most of his actual work at home and in coffee shops and shared work spaces.
''If this were the 1980s, I'd need a corner office,'' says Shama Kabani, 25, a Y.E.C. member and founder of Marketing Zen, a digital marketing firm in Dallas, with yearly revenue in the seven figures. ''All you need today is a laptop, patience and willingness,'' she says. Ms. Kabani hired all of her 24 employees virtually; 15 are in the Philippines. ''I've never met any of them,'' she says.
Open-source software can reduce or eliminate the need for consultants and tech support. When Annie Wang, 21, co-founder of HerCampus.com, wanted the articles on the site to rotate in a slide show, she didn't hire a Web designer. She found a free online resource and spent a day teaching herself how to create the slide show.
Being a young entrepreneur means coming up with creative ways to fill your knowledge gaps, says Eric Bahn, 29, a council member and founder of BeatTheGMAT.com, an M.B.A. applicant community that generates close to seven figures in revenue. Mr. Bahn, who does not have a technical background, found a free resource on the Web and taught himself HTML to build his site.
Most of the business owners who belong to the council did not need much physical space to start their companies. For the person who wants to start a restaurant, a bakery, an exercise studio -- or any other business that requires renting or owning property -- the barriers and expenses are still high. Mr. Gerber warns that anyone starting a brick-and-mortar business still faces the same cost barriers they always have -- including high rent. He advises young people to start a business that does not require expensive space.
BUT start-ups do need some financing. So Mr. Gerber is also starting the Gen Y Fund, from which young entrepreneurs can seek funding. Council members will have the option of investing in the fund starting next year.
Could it be that the council and separate fund are mainly a way for Mr. Gerber to identify new investing opportunities? He emphatically says no, adding that helping young people succeed as entrepreneurs through the council is his passion.
As far as the fund is concerned, ''We are looking to spearhead a major shift in how resources are allocated to our generation, because no one from above is going to do it,'' he says.
The goal of the fund is not to find the next Facebook or sexy Web start-up, Mr. Gerber says; instead, it will look for practicable and marketable business ideas. In fact, a favorite phrase of his is ''boring is better.'' He'll be looking for businesses that are incubated outside of Silicon Valley.
The council and fund do add visibility to Mr. Gerber's entrepreneurial empire. In addition to running Sizzle It, Mr. Gerber writes a widely syndicated column for young entrepreneurs, and he recently published a book called ''Never Get a 'Real' Job: How to Dump Your Boss, Build a Business, and Not Go Broke.'' He also runs Gerber Enterprises, his personal investing fund, and is an investor in a restaurant group.
Mr. Gerber has never taken a business or economics class; he says he took a lot of people out to lunch to learn about the nuts and bolts of the business world. ''I didn't go to my third-tier upper-management boss,'' he says. ''I e-mailed people in my circle and figured who knew what I needed to know.''
Lack of experience can actually be an asset to young business owners. When Ms. Kabani first started Marketing Zen, she tried to hide her age through a combination of wardrobe choices and trying to sound ''older.'' ''I thought I was fooling all these people, but then one of my clients told me he hired me because I was 23. He wanted someone who spoke digital as a first language, not a second. It was a mind-blowing moment for me.''
Ms. Hanger, co-founder of HerCampus.com along with Ms. Wang and Stephanie Kaplan, 22, says being young helps attract advertisers like New Balance and Juicy Couture to the site. ''They like that I am my readership. I was in college six months ago,'' she says. The site recently started turning a profit.
MANY of the council members aren't bankrolled by their parents. Only a third of them received outside funding to start their businesses. In fact, Mr. Gerber's message to young entrepreneurs is ''No one will give you money'' and ''Start on a shoestring budget,'' something many of them did.
For many of these entrepreneurs, success didn't happen overnight. Mr. Bahn started BeatTheGMAT.com in 2005 as a blog that developed a following over the course of a few years. It was three years before he quit his day job in a general management program at Intuit to work on the site full time.
Even if these 20-somethings pulled it off, the reality is a vast majority of entrepreneurs, of any age, don't succeed. ''The first business is probably going to fail,'' says Arel Moodie, 27, a Y.E.C. member and co-owner of the Extreme Entrepreneurship Tour, which educates college students on starting a business. Mr. Moodie's first two businesses -- a calendar company and a protein drink company -- flopped and put him $30,000 in debt. (He has paid it off.)
Ben Brinckerhoff, 28, who is not a member of the council, started Devver.net, an online tool to test computer software in 2008. The company folded last spring.
Mr. Brinckerhoff was formerly a software developer at Microsoft. ''There are very real cons to starting a company. It can hurt your ego, and financially it's a big hit. If I had stayed at my old job at Microsoft, I would have been better off financially,'' he says.
The silver lining, however, was that Mr. Brinckerhoff got inquiries from 10 companies about working for them after they read on the Web or heard through word of mouth that his company had failed.
''Employers like the entrepreneurial skill set,'' he says. ''They want to hire people who are risk-takers and can make quick decisions.'' He is now working as a freelance Web and technology consultant in Boulder, Colo., and hopes to start another company.
When deciding whether to start a business, ''You have to really want to do it,'' says Maia Josebachvili, 27, a council member and founder of Urban Escapes, which organizes outdoor trips. She quit her job as a derivatives trader on Wall Street to start her company, which grew to 45 employees and was recently acquired by LivingSocial, a consumer site.
''It takes a lot of discipline. I didn't eat out for the first six months, and I lived on my friend's couch,'' Ms. Josebachvili says. ''Unless you are independently wealthy, it's a lifestyle adjustment.''

Here's a sampling of readers' responses to Chuck Klosterman's essay about the television show ''Walking Dead'' and the current popularity of zombie culture:
''With all of the bad economic news I keep reading about -- and seeing in my own life -- I'm starting to feel like a zombie myself. It's no wonder 'Walking Dead' is so popular. The show is a metaphor for what is happening to the American worker right now. Think of the undead as the unemployed, and you'll see what I mean.''
JIM KELLY of Haines City, Fla. 
''Zombies are not the most interesting thing in zombie movies. What people really secretly love is the idea of surviving in a world where humanity has been reduced to a few people, but where all of the gadgets remain. What isn't great about taking over a small town, collecting massive firepower along the way, and 'surviving'? It's like camping, only more dangerous, more thrilling -- and permanent.''
ANDY HASSELWANDER of Bethesda, Md.
''Every time I'm driving down a highway, and suddenly there are tons of cars coming from the other direction but no cars on my side of the highway, I have a brief, fearful moment that I'm driving into a zombie apocalypse that everyone knows about -- and is escaping -- but me. This is why it's best not to make long car trips alone.''
SARAH MORAN of Columbia, S.C.
''I like to think that my many years of video-game playing has prepared me for the zombie apocalypse (or alien invasion, take your pick). In those games you usually get a weapon with unlimited ammo. I imagine the real challenge to survival is to not run out of bullets.''
DANIEL DOESCHNER of New York
''As a New York resident, zombie entertainment resonates with me in the nightly killing sprees I conduct on the roaches in my kitchen. I feel a kinship with the beleaguered characters on 'Walking Dead,' battling back a tide that never seems to wane.''
MIKE ANGELL of New York
''The zombie revival (heh) started with Max Brooks's 'Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead,' which skewered the Bush administration's constant warnings of terrorist danger (color-coded warning levels, directions to stock up on duct tape and pre-cut plastic sheeting, etc.) with parallel explanations of how to be prepared for a zombie outbreak.''
JON WEBB of Pittsburgh
''I see in zombies a great metaphor for the hyper-consumption of society of today. These hordes of zombies are brain dead and only seeking fresh flesh. When I saw video of people rushing into stores on Black Friday, the parallel became obvious.''
CHRISTIAN R. BERGERON of Montreal
''Our interest in zombies has less to do with our fear of being 'consumed' by modern-day ennui and more to do with our interest in our own capacity for horror and our fear of one another. 'The Walking Dead' has succeeded because it showcases that in a world filled with the undead, people are the real monsters.''
MARISSA MILLER of Seattle
''Zombies reflect the dystopian nightmare of planetwide overcrowding and the cementing over of the earth. Mr. Klosterman shotgunned the zombie on the head when he tagged them as 'collective and brainless.' That's what's waiting for us in the future: a swarming, collective mass of stupid consumers.''
TULLA BRENDINGULLO of Heidelberg, Germany

HEADLINE: Tinsel Town

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
NEW YORKERS are notoriously opinionated. But who knew that holiday decor could be even more contentious than Yankees versus Mets or who around town makes the best bagel?
Small revolutions have been mounted when an apartment building's lobby has gone without a Christmas tree and a menorah during the holiday season, or when a renegade Christmas tree has suddenly appeared in a building that has never had one.
In a city where people live in small spaces and close quarters, many see the lobby as an extension of home, and consequently can be very particular about how it is decorated. And being New Yorkers, they aren't bashful about making their feelings known.
Gideon Stein, the board president at the Ariel West, a condo on the Upper West Side, said he oversaw ''a very heated debate'' over holiday decorations two years ago. 
The building was new and had a tree and a menorah, but few were entirely satisfied. The discussion revolved around religious equality. Some people didn't want a Christmas tree, others then said there shouldn't be a menorah, and to be fully inclusive, there was talk of Kwanzaa, even though no one in the building seemed to celebrate it.
''It started off religious and quickly became an issue about what was tasteful,'' Mr. Stein said. ''That's when I learned to never again open anything up for debate with 65 other people, because it very quickly gets out of hand.''
Last year, in hopes of avoiding controversy, Mr. Stein took the $250 usually spent on decorations and instead bought a water buffalo for a village in the Philippines through Heifer International. But the charitable buffalo fell flat. Complaints flowed in, and one resident said the treeless lobby had ruined his son's Christmas.
That's when Bruce Littlefield, a resident of Ariel West and the author of ''Merry Christmas, America!'' (Collins Design, 2007), stepped in. He quickly lined a lobby wall with packages wrapped in silver, only to have one resident ask why there weren't any blue packages and another why there weren't any red ones. He promptly produced a few of each.
''What an amalgam New York is! And making everyone happy is quite the challenge,'' the ever-cheerful Mr. Littlefield said.
''The water buffalo was a good deed,'' he said. ''But we have a building with 108 kids, and that wasn't something they could see and feel.''
This year Mr. Littlefield is the head of the decorating committee. Now, the lobby is enlivened by a resident-donated Christmas tree decorated with 108 silver ornaments. There are also silver pine cones; white lights; a pewter menorah; and silver (silver only) packages, including a jumbo one for a building's coat drive for the needy. As he applied the finishing touches one day recently, a neighbor breezed by and shouted, ''Look how festive this looks -- and so nonsectarian!''
Holiday decorations can easily become controversial because Christmas is both a national and a religious holiday, and anything that refers to Christmas can feel like ''an alien symbol being forced upon a non-Christian population,'' said Jack Santino, a professor in the department of popular culture at Bowling Green State University.
''People feel very strongly, pro and con, about all of this,'' he said in an e-mail. ''These are, after all, religious and cultural symbols, wrapped up in questions of identity, faith, lifelong memories and experiences. They are personal, even while being general.''
To be sure, the vast majority of apartment buildings in the city have entirely uncontroversial trees and menorahs in their lobbies, and many don't even eschew traditional Christmas red, as long as it's balanced with Hanukkah blue. Some go further and put out fresh poinsettias and wreaths. The few that pull out all the stops might have Santa Claus or even a nativity scene.
The double-height lobby at the Grand Sutton, a 1980s apartment tower on East 59th Street, turns into what looks like a grand parlor in an English manor house ''that's been done up to the nines,'' said Fern Hammond, a senior vice president of Halstead Property who has sold several apartments in the building.
The spectacular display changes annually, and this year, in addition to a 10-foot tree and a 6-foot-high menorah, swags of pine garland wrapped with crimson ribbon and pine cones hang from the woodwork, along with six-foot-long icicles. The space is transformed every December by the superintendent, Charles Mallon, and his merry elves, among whom are the building's florist, Bill Ricci, and several building employees.
Mr. Mallon adheres to a tight budget, replacing tired ribbon or other accents when the need arises, and also trading decorations with the managers of other buildings. ''That way I freshen up my lobby each year and they do, too,'' he said. His goal, he said, is to have residents' eyes light up as soon as they enter the foyer.
''I want to remind them that their house begins right here and their community is a family,'' Mr. Mallon declared.
Natalie Berkowitz, who celebrates Hanukkah and whose husband is the president of the Grand Sutton's board, said there had never been any complaints. ''People appreciate that Charlie does it with so much grace and enthusiasm,'' she said. ''And anybody who is 'bah! humbug!' about it just stays away from the holiday party.''
Buildings that do nothing to recognize the holidays are the exception, said Paul J. Herman, the president for residential management of Brown Harris Stevens, which manages about 150 buildings. ''There are very few buildings that don't do anything at all,'' he said. ''We sometimes get complaints that it's gaudy or it's not enough, but not that there's something there.''
The cost of decking a building's halls varies tremendously. The New York City Fire Department discourages the use of cut trees in lobbies, for fire safety reasons, and the expense of a fake tree and decorations can range from a few hundred dollars to as much as $15,000, Mr. Herman said, but that could be a one-time expense.
In rental buildings, the landlord makes the call on decor, but in co-ops and condos, boards are the arbiters. ''A board can decide how over-the-top it wants to be or how minimal it wants to be,'' said Paul Gottsegen, the president of the Halstead Management Company. ''And things can change from year to year, depending on who on the board is in charge.''
It is typically when a building is new or when a new board president takes over that holiday decorations become an issue. But at a stately prewar building at Riverside Drive and 90th Street that had long observed the holidays with a simple lobby display of poinsettias and a few white lights on the bushes out front, decorations became a flashpoint a few years ago when someone set up a Christmas tree in the lobby without board approval. The unauthorized tree was promptly removed.
This fall, a decorations survey went out to residents. ''Everyone apparently was quite opinionated,'' said Michaela Gold, an agent at Halstead Property who lives in the building. ''But the feeling was, if you start with a menorah and a Christmas tree, what do you do about Kwanzaa or Russian Christmas or other religions, and where does it stop?''
She said this year there had been significant demand to step things up. So now the building has big wreaths made out of pine cones, and a much larger assortment of poinsettias and lights. ''They wanted to be more festive,'' Ms. Gold said, ''but also understated.''
In the still-sagging economy, some buildings have scaled back their holiday decorations.
LeFrak City, a 20-building rental complex in Corona, Queens, has had an eye-catching outdoor light display, visible from cars zooming by on the Long Island Expressway, ever since it opened in the 1960s. The colorful spectacle has included strings of lights to create a tree; Santa waving from his sleigh; a giant menorah; and the words: ''Season's Greetings from LeFrak City,'' ''Happy Hanukkah'' and ''Peace on Earth.''
But this year, ''the former holiday decorations at LeFrak City have been retired,'' said Ed Cortese, a senior vice president of the LeFrak Organization. New L.E.D. lights now outline parts of the buildings, using only 10 percent of the wattage of the previous display.
Dan Wurtzel, the president of Cooper Square Realty, which manages about 400 buildings, said some buildings had retrenched on holiday decorations ''to save a few dollars, and even though it may not have impacted the budget much, it psychologically felt better to do less.''
At 15 Broad Street, which Cooper Square manages, building staff members used to reinvent the iconic 1,900-piece Louis XV chandelier in the lobby by replacing the scores of white light bulbs with red ones. ''But they're not doing it this year because of the expense,'' Mr. Wurtzel said. ''It's very labor-intensive to rebulb that chandelier.''
Some buildings use the holidays as a time to nurture a sense of community.
At Schwab House, a 600-unit co-op at Riverside Drive and 73rd Street, lobby decorations are limited to a tree and a small menorah, but the board organizes a menorah-lighting party on the first night of Hanukkah and also gives a catered holiday party that usually draws several hundred residents.
The building is so large that it is its own voting district, said Keith Marder, a co-op board member and a Halstead agent. ''You can be as anonymous as you want or as active as you want,'' he said. At the recent menorah lighting, 9-year-old Avi Blitzer led about 50 residents in prayer, and the Schwab House singing group led them in song.
''We don't go crazy with decorations,'' Mr. Marder said. ''But the holidays are very festive at the Schwab House, and people feel like they really belong to something.''
The residents of Rose Tallis's 52-unit building on East 69th Street gather at a potluck holiday party each year. But what really sets the place apart is the Christmas tree, decorated entirely with ornaments handmade by the children of the building at annual tree-trimming parties.
Ms. Tallis, a vice president of Halstead who served on the building's board and oversaw holiday decor for many years, said the tree ''really gives you the character of the building, and every ornament has a memory.''
Over the years, the building has switched from front-door wreaths to large red bows to save money, and from white lights on its outdoor trees to red lights and back again to white. ''Some people thought the red lights were a little too adventurous,'' she said.
The tree, though, has not drawn any criticism.
''It's become a very rich tree with all of our children's ornaments,'' said Vera Danovitch, who has overseen the tree-trimming for several years and whose two daughters, now teenagers, have made many contributions. ''The ornaments are a touchstone of their childhoods and of our lives, too.''
Correction: December 19, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about holiday decorations in building lobbies misstated New York City's policy on the use of cut trees. The New York City Fire Department discourages but does not prohibit them.

HEADLINE: Imposing Stricter Rules on For-Profit Colleges

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Dec. 7 editorial ''Rules for Gainful Education'' should have been titled ''Rules for Guaranteeing Unemployment.'' The Department of Education's misguided attempt to nationalize and centralize education planning for the most at-risk students can have only one outcome if the ''gainful employment'' rule is adopted: fewer minority students will get any postsecondary education and will be restricted to low-paying, low-skilled, no-future jobs -- if they can get any job at all. 
Your editorial states that the department has held up the gainful employment rule to ''make sure that it does no harm to well-run for-profits.'' If there are bad actors in the career-oriented college business, then go after the bad actors; it is senseless to promulgate a rule that has the strong potential to do harm to every for-profit college.
The Department of Education has the tools right now to protect students against predatory practices. Imposing a sweeping new rule on the vast majority of career-oriented colleges that are providing good, needed, well-guided educational opportunities to those students who need it most is senseless.
Harry Alford Chief Executive, National Black Chamber of Commerce Washington, Dec. 7, 2010
To the Editor:
With recent college graduates suffering through the worst economy since the Great Depression, the Obama administration's gainful employment rules will affect far more than just 5 percent of the country's proprietary colleges.
While we strongly support efforts to weed out the bad actors in higher education, the proposed rules -- with their narrow focus on loan repayment rates -- would shutter even some of the country's best colleges.
Most institutions in New York, one of the nation's best-regulated proprietary sectors, with higher graduation and job placement rates than many of the state's nonprofit and state universities, would be negatively affected.
Additionally, the singular focus on proprietary institutions is misguided. There are colleges across the higher education spectrum whose students have substandard debt-to-income ratios.
If the administration is truly interested in ensuring that college leads to gainful employment, then it should be looking at outcomes across the system and pursue a broader policy to improve accountability.
Stephen Jerome Bronx, Dec. 7, 2010
The writer, president of Monroe College, is president of the Association of Proprietary Colleges.

HEADLINE: A Madoff Son Hangs Himself On Father's Arrest Anniversary

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES and AL BAKER; Peter Lattman, Liz Robbins and Tim Stelloh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mark Madoff, the older of Bernard L. Madoff's two sons, hanged himself in his Manhattan apartment on Saturday, the second anniversary of his father's arrest for running a gigantic Ponzi scheme that shattered thousands of lives around the world.
''Mark Madoff took his own life today,'' Martin Flumenbaum, Mark Madoff's lawyer, said in a statement. ''This is a terrible and unnecessary tragedy.'' He called his client ''an innocent victim of his father's monstrous crime who succumbed to two years of unrelenting pressure from false accusations and innuendo.''
According to Deputy Police Commissioner Paul J. Browne, officers responded to a 911 call made just before 7:30 Saturday morning from Mr. Madoff's apartment building at 158 Mercer Street. Mr. Browne said Mr. Madoff's body was found hanging from a black dog leash attached to a metal beam on the living room ceiling. He said there was no evidence of foul play.
Mr. Madoff's 2-year-old son was asleep in an adjoining bedroom, Mr. Browne said. 
Law enforcement officials said Mr. Madoff had sent e-mails to his wife in Florida sometime after 4 a.m. Saturday. ''It was more than one,'' said an official, who added: ''He basically tells his wife he loves her and he wants someone to check on the child.''
Mr. Browne said the body was discovered by Martin London, a prominent New York lawyer who is the stepfather of Mark Madoff's wife, Stephanie. Mr. London apparently had gone to the apartment in response to the message to check on the child. Reached by phone, Mr. London declined to comment.
A person in close contact with the family who had spoken with Mark Madoff frequently in the last few weeks said he had been in ''an increasingly fragile state of mind'' as the anniversary of his father's arrest approached. The person said Mr. Madoff had expressed both continuing bitterness toward his father and anxiety about a series of lawsuits that were filed against him, his brother Andrew and other family members.
Just last week, Mr. Madoff, 46, was among the directors and officers of a Madoff affiliate in London who were sued by the trustee seeking assets for victims of the scheme.
It was the second lawsuit filed against him by the trustee, Irving H. Picard, who had initially sued him last year seeking to recover approximately $200 million that the family had received in salaries, bonuses, expense-account payments and gains in their own investment accounts at the Madoff firm.
Mr. Madoff was particularly upset that the trustee had named his young children as defendants in a lawsuit filed in late November seeking the recovery of money Bernard Madoff had paid out to his extended family over the years, according to the person who recently spoke with him, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on behalf of the family.
The person said Mr. Madoff had also been upset at some recent news coverage speculating that criminal charges against him and his brother were still likely.
Charges have not been filed against any of the immediate family members, and their lawyer has said publicly that neither Mark Madoff nor his brother has ever been notified by prosecutors that they were the subjects of a criminal investigation.
Nevertheless, there has been speculation that members of the Madoff family were vulnerable to being prosecuted for tax-law violations, given the variety of low-cost loans and generous expense-account payments that were part of the office culture at the Madoff brokerage firm.
The person who had recently spoken with Mr. Madoff said that there was also growing discouragement about finding a job. ''He had concluded he was unemployable,'' the person said.
Ira Lee Sorkin, a lawyer for Bernard Madoff, said he had not been able to contact his client at the North Carolina prison where he is serving a 150-year sentence for his crimes.
''But I'm very sure he has been informed,'' Mr. Sorkin said, adding, ''This is a great tragedy on many, many levels.''
A spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Traci Billingsley, said, ''Any time there is a death of a family member, and the agency is notified, we immediately notify the inmate.''
Inmates may request to attend funerals, she said, and those requests are considered case by case.
Peter Chavkin, a lawyer for Ruth Madoff, Mark's mother, said simply: ''Ruth is heartbroken.''
Mark Madoff had been a licensed broker at his father's firm since June 1987. A number of Mark's oldest childhood friends from Roslyn, N.Y., invested with the Madoff firm and lost their savings in the fraud, said another person who was close to the family. This destroyed those relationships and caused Mr. Madoff great pain, the person said..
And on the advice of his lawyer, Mark Madoff has had no contact with his parents since the day before his father's arrest two years ago.
The steps that led to that arrest began when he and his brother, Andrew, confronted their father over his plans to distribute hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses to employees months ahead of schedule.
According to documents filed by the F.B.I. at the time of the arrest, that meeting led to a private conversation on Dec. 10, 2008, in which Bernard Madoff told his sons that all the wealth and success the family seemed to possess were based on a lie -- an immense Ponzi scheme that was crumbling under the pressures of the financial crisis.
Mark and his brother immediately consulted a lawyer and were advised they had to report their father's confession to law enforcement. They did so, and the following morning their father was arrested at his Manhattan penthouse.
The public fury over the stunning crime -- Bernard Madoff estimated the losses at $50 billion -- was not limited to its mastermind. Mark Madoff, his mother and his brother were all the subject of constant media speculation. Many articles speculated that they had been involved in their father's crime, or at least were aware of it.
The lawsuits that are pending against Mr. Madoff will not necessarily be derailed by his death. Typically, the litigation would continue against the estate of any deceased defendant.
The autopsy on Mr. Madoff is scheduled to be conducted on Sunday, said Ellen S. Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city's chief medical examiner, Charles S. Hirsch. She said that the results should be available ''by early afternoon'' on Sunday.
Mr. Madoff's body was removed on a stretcher from his building on the edge of SoHo shortly after noon Saturday. Police blocked off the street for a while as a crowd of reporters and camera crews mixed with a growing number of people stopping to watch. The building is also home to the performer Jon Bon Jovi.
Gregarious and handsome, Mark was the more outgoing of Mr. Madoff's two sons. At the University of Michigan, his social circle included students largely from other well-to-do East Coast families.
He graduated in 1986 and moved to New York to join his father's firm. Most of his friends rented crammed studios, but Mark lived in an apartment his father had bought for him in Sterling Plaza, a luxury high-rise on Manhattan's East Side developed by Sterling Equities. Sterling is controlled by Fred Wilpon, the owner of the New York Mets, whose family was friendly with the Madoffs and whose businesses had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the Ponzi scheme.
Mark Madoff married his college girlfriend, Susan, and moved to Greenwich, Conn., where they raised two children. They divorced in the 1990s and Mark eventually moved back to Manhattan. He was remarried, to Stephanie Mikesell, and had two more children with her.
His brother Andrew was considered more cerebral and reserved than Mark, and served as co-director of trading with his brother. He, too, joined his father's firm after earning an undergraduate business degree from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
The civil lawsuit Mr. Picard filed last year said Bernard Madoff's firm ''operated as if it were the family piggy bank.'' It said Mark received at least $66.9 million of improper proceeds, including approximately $30 million in compensation since 2001, from his father's firm.
Mark and his relatives were ''completely derelict'' in carrying out their roles at the firm, the suit said.
At the time, Mr. Flumenbaum, Mark's lawyer, said in a statement that his client ''strongly disagreed with the trustee's baseless claims.''

HEADLINE: Losing A Job, Mourning A Lifestyle

BYLINE: By SUSAN WINSTON. 
E-mail: preoccupations@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AS a therapist in private practice and a volunteer at a free mental health clinic in Los Angeles, I have become aware of a new group of severely depressed people: those who have lost their jobs in the entertainment industry. Their skills have become dispensable in this economy, and their sense of self-worth has plummeted along with their bank accounts.
Beverly Hills is an industry town, home to movie-making and television production. This community is used to a life of creative fulfillment and a sense of everyday well-being. The people who have been cut off from this world are having a hard time finding their way. The phrase ''Down and Out in Beverly Hills'' -- the title of a 1986 Hollywood farce -- has become a widespread reality. 
California's unemployment rate is more than 12 percent -- much higher than the national average. Entertainment companies -- including Disney, Warner Brothers and Paramount -- have been among those that have cut jobs.
The number of theatrical films produced in the United States has dropped sharply in the last several years. The number of television pilots has declined as well.
Consider the trickle-down effect. Fewer movies and TV pilots means less work for actors, writers, directors, producers, technicians, public relations specialists, agents, lawyers, composers and many others.
It may be hard to feel much sympathy for these people. The assumption is that they can sit back and take it easy -- maybe even follow their dreams a la ''Eat Pray Love'' the best seller and Hollywood movie in which a woman follows her expensive dreams in search of self.
Many of the newly jobless in Hollywood do have savings and severance, but others do not. Some have been living beyond their means and must face a frightening new financial reality. These people cannot ramble around the world to find themselves when the financial ground is crumbling beneath them.
So many of the newly unemployed were fortunate to live ''the dream'': they had nice homes, cars and clothes, ate at expensive restaurants and went on vacation at least once a year. They spoiled their children with computers and iPods.
With unemployment so high, these people often struggle to find a similar job, or any job -- especially if they are over 50. The harsh reality is that when entertainment companies do hire, they often choose to forgo the value of age and experience in favor of younger, cheaper neophytes.
As a result, the jobless may find themselves unable to pay their mortgages and fear losing their homes. They may need to downsize and sell their possessions to a degree that is almost paralyzing. I treat one former executive who has lived in his car on a Santa Monica street (the city has become very liberal in allowing the homeless to park without penalty).
All too often, as financial resources dwindle, family life and other relationships suffer, too -- which can lead to isolation and even suicidal thoughts. But here comes the next problem: The newly unemployed have often lost their health coverage as well as their jobs.
A $200-an-hour session with a therapist might have been possible in an earlier life, but it is out of the question now. Free clinics like the one where I work are now inundated with requests for mental health care.
But just as demand is rising, resources are drying up. Recently, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger cut $133 million for mental health care from the California state budget.
Seeking my own hedge against the employment peril, I returned to school several years ago and obtained my master's degree in counseling. I am also a television producer who has worked, not worked, worked again, and been a victim of economic downturns. I know how the loss of a job can affect an artist.
My job is to give these people back their dignity, their self-esteem and their lives and to help turn years of well-honed skills into new opportunities. The movers and shakers of yesterday are needed to pave the way today. They just have to learn to take a different road.
The Hollywood creative community represents a vibrant group of leaders and thinkers and doers. They have a whole history of experience and a wealth of ideas.
These are not people who want to live off the system and collect welfare or unemployment. They want to continue being valued members of society. But some of them need affordable mental health care and follow-up to achieve that.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths DI VALMARANA, MARIO.

 BODY:
di VALMARANA--Mario.,of Charlottesville, Virginia, and Venice, Italy, a talented architect, outstanding educator, leader in historic preservation and devoted father and husband, died on October 13 at his home in Venice. He was 81. His distinguished 52-year career was remarkable for its breadth. It encompassed 14 years of professional practice with architectural firms in New York City and Washington, D.C. on a wide range of urban projects. 
He taught in the School of Architecture at the University of Virginia for 28 years, where he served as Director of the Historic Preservation Program and founded the School's first international study programs, in Vicenza and Venice, which remain an essential part of the curriculum. As author of a number of influential works on the theory and ethics of historic preservation he redefined and expanded the scope of the field and the values informing its practice. Mario di Valmarana was born on August 16, 1929, in Venice, Italy. After earning his architecture degree from the Istituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice in 1955, he moved the following year to New York City, where he practiced architecture and attended graduate courses in Columbia University's School of Architecture. In 1963 he married Betty Baker Supplee in Philadelphia. During the 1960s he practiced architecture as an associate in a variety of firms, including Alfred E. Poor, Architects, New York; Giuliani Associates Architects, Washington, D.C., and Corning, Moore, Elmore & Fischer, Washington, D.C. In 1972 he was recruited to teach in the University of Virginia's School of Architecture, which remained his academic home until his retirement in 2000. He was a legendary professor who combined a profound grasp of the history of architecture, studio instruction, and historic preservation with enthusiasm, eloquence, and a sense of humor. A strong advocate for historic preservation, both nationally and internationally, he chaired the Advisory Committee for the restoration of Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater and supervised the preservation of Andrea Palladio's Villa Almerico Capra "La Rotonda", which is owned by the Valmarana family. He also founded the Center for Palladian Studies in America and received numerous awards for his work in preservation, including an Honorary Citizenship from the city of New Orleans and a Knighthood from the Italian government. He is survived by his wife, Betty, and two sons, Francesco and Alessandro, two brothers, Lodovico and Alberto, and two sisters, Lodovica Grimani and Maria Catalano Gonzaga, as well as three grandchildren. He will be remembered for his love of family and friends, his generosity and boundless energy, and his grace, kindness, and eloquence. He loved life's beauty and bounty, whether in the form of good wine, delicious food, rare books, fine art, or outstanding architecture. He imparted that spirit to those who knew him, and they have never forgotten it. He was a deeply cultivated man. The family requests that, if desired, any contributions be made through the UVa School of Architecture Foundation to safeguard the funding for the Venetan Programs that Professor di Valmarana founded 35 years ago. Please direct your contribution to the Mario di Valmarana Memorial Fund payable to the UVa School of Architecture Foundation, P.O. Box 400122, Charlottesville, Virginia 22901.

HEADLINE: A Connection Missed

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

 BODY:
HAMPTON, Ga. -- Keith Fitzhugh, America's most celebrated train conductor, rose for work at 4:30 on Friday morning. He drove roughly 120 miles north to Dalton, punched in at Norfolk Southern and donned his bright yellow safety vest and the orange hat that signified his trainee status.
The three previous days felt like a dream. He held interviews with ABC's Diane Sawyer, CNN and ESPN; took a congratulatory phone call from his company's president; received an inquiry from a game show; and experienced several firsts, including wearing makeup, for the cameras.
Late Thursday night, his living room here was a testament to the power of his story and the 24-hour news cycle. Tripods had left imprints on the blue carpet. Couches and chairs were pushed against the walls. 
All this stemmed from what Fitzhugh, 24, did not do: accept an offer to rejoin the Jets for an undetermined time. Because of the way he had conducted himself, choosing family over football, he became an overnight sensation, an example, in this economy, of values and virtue and, corny as it sounds, doing the right thing.
''I had no idea any of this was coming,'' Fitzhugh said. ''I'm just a normal guy. I work on the railroad.''
That was the point, right? Fitzhugh is a normal guy, a former safety with typical problems, struggles and a job in transportation. He lives with his parents: Keith Sr., a former truck driver who had two hip replacements and now uses a cane to get around the house, and Meltonia, an office supervisor for a freight company, the family rock.
Fitzhugh loves trains. Really, really loves trains, so much so that in college, he paid a few hundred dollars to install a train horn in his Dodge Magnum.
When the Jets called, Fitzhugh had about 30 minutes to decide. N.F.L. teams keep shortlists of available players in case of injury, but the summoned must leave immediately or teams move on. There is no sleeping on it. Later, Fitzhugh found out Norfolk Southern would have granted him a leave. Had he known that, he would have taken it. But he did not.
Heart thumping, mind racing, Fitzhugh thought about the money, $5,200 a week on the practice squad, less expenses, taxed at a higher rate. He thought about the N.F.L. puppy mill that had discarded him three times. Mostly, he thought about his family.
Thanks, but no thanks, he told the Jets. To the outside world, this was unusual. But to Fitzhugh's fifth-grade teacher, it was simply Keith.
''Didn't surprise me one bit,'' Diane Cameron, his former teacher, said. ''That kid would be a success story if he was living on the street.''
In school, Cameron continued, Fitzhugh challenged even teachers to footraces, excelled at math and declared he would play professional football. He also rambled on often about trains.
His parents met in high school, and when Meltonia moved to Florida, Keith Sr. chased her, showed up unannounced and proposed. Thirty-four years later, they have raised three children on the tenets of faith and family. They had rules. Come home. Clean house. Do homework. Eat dinner, together, every night.
Their youngest, Brittany, died at 14 from complications of the West Nile virus or another illness. The Fitzhughs are not sure. If the family was strong before her death, it was impenetrable afterward.
Less than a mile from the family home, Norfolk Southern's freight trains rumbled parallel to Tara Boulevard. Fitzhugh watched them while he ate at restaurants or sat at stoplights. Each time, he felt a familiar longing, a hope for conductors to blow the horn. If they did, he could hear it even at home.
Early on, he played with train sets, the tracks snaking around the living room. Fitzhugh took his first passenger train trip from New York to Atlanta as a child. He sat for hours, silent, staring out the window, entranced by the animals and changing scenery. The feeling hooked him. Freedom is the best way he can describe it.
Before the Jets re-signed and released him in August, Fitzhugh applied to several railroads, including the most familiar, Norfolk Southern. He entered the company's training program in September, just as his N.F.L. money was running out.
Fitzhugh works at least 40 hours a week, sometimes in 12-hour shifts, sometimes on trains, sometimes in the yard. He has helped transport a variety of shipments -- he declined to say what -- as far as from Atlanta to Chattanooga, Tenn.
But nothing beats the engine room, with its two seats and hundreds of switches and dials, which transport him back to childhood.
''There's no feeling like it,'' he said, his voice filled with excitement. ''You're in total control.''
Fitzhugh finds parallels between his passions. A former safety, he lists safety as his most important job description. He takes copious notes on operations instead of game plans. He listens to the veterans, conductors of all ethnicities, some with more than 30 years' experience, as they tell stories and discuss how much trains have changed.
He works in tandem with an engineer, a relationship not unlike that of cornerback and safety. They receive instructions from dispatchers, who are like coaches.
Families sometimes line the tracks, waving as trains pass like football fans, hoping, as Fitzhugh hoped, that the horn will blow. And when he receives the call to drive, he feels the same as when coaches sent him onto the field.
''Just like in the N.F.L., when the coach calls you, you have to be ready to go in and do your job,'' he said. ''You know what you're supposed to do when each play is called. You have to execute.''
Growing up, Fitzhugh idolized Denver safety Brian Dawkins so much that he lifted weights a certain way to sculpture the same body type. But he always looked beyond football, too, graduating early from Mississippi State, with honors.
That helped the times that the Jets and Baltimore released him. Linebacker Bart Scott used to tease Fitzhugh each time he returned. ''Fitz, you just don't die,'' Scott would say. Problem was, he did not stick, either.
Fitzhugh said the most common question he had received since Tuesday was, ''What were you thinking?'' But he believes that those who asked misunderstood N.F.L. economics.
Much as he wanted, he was not a star. He was the player who fetched fried chicken for defensive backs on Saturdays, who helped buy the cheeseburgers consumed during an infamous August scrimmage that incensed Coach Rex Ryan on HBO's ''Hard Knocks.''
When Fitzhugh sees the railroad as long term, he means for life. Same with family loyalty. His probation period will end early in 2011, and eventually, he hopes to become an engineer. But knowing what he knows now, if another team calls, if the Jets call again, he will give football another shot.
His agent, Daniel Rose, recently gave Fitzhugh the following quotation: To get something you've always wanted, you have to do something you've never done. The events of the past week certainly qualify. Even his pastor, Michael Gray, said he would use Fitzhugh's story on Sunday as his congregation's inspiration.
''I always wanted to be that star,'' Fitzhugh said. ''I was humbled, but God helped me reach people in the most unlikely way. I'm not doing this for fun or publicity or any other reason. I'm doing this because this is who I am.''
Speaking of humbled, America's most famous train conductor wrapped up his final Thursday interview around 10:30 p.m. His mother instructed him to rest for work the next morning. But first, as his father reminded him, Fitzhugh had a living room to clean.

HEADLINE: Hoop Dreams of His Own Design

BYLINE: By DOROTHY SPEARS

 BODY:
Los Angeles
OF the opportunities once facing Mark Bradford, who is 6 foot 8, hoop dreams were probably among the more viable ones.
In the mid-1970s Mr. Bradford, then a teenager, shocked everyone -- including himself -- by growing 10 inches in a single summer. Strangers on the streets here in his hometown kept badgering him with unsolicited suggestions. ''They would say, 'If I were your height, I would be a basketball player and make a million dollars,' '' Mr. Bradford said in an interview in September at his studio.
Instead he became an apprentice in his mother's beauty shop. ''It was my first defiant act,'' he said. 
Now 49, Mr. Bradford has the physical stature and refined, fluid movements of an athlete. But the endpapers he once used for curling hair have since found their way into his abstract collages, with titles referring to musicians like Tupac Shakur and Smokey Robinson. These, along with his political, spoofy videos (in one he's in a Lakers-inspired purple-and-gold hoop skirt, attempting to dunk a basketball), and mammoth paintings made from layers of glued-together posters torn from the fences of abandoned lots near his studio, have earned Mr. Bradford a 2009 MacArthur grant. And a 10-year survey of his paintings, sculptures and video installations, organized by the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, has recently opened at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, where it will remain through March 13.
Yet even with the art world more or less at his feet, Mr. Bradford continues to challenge himself, changing the direction of his work almost as soon as a new idea gains traction because, as he explained, ''the stereotype is always following you, like a monkey on your back.'' And for every turn his work takes, he returns to this studio, where he finds the inspiration and the meditative equilibrium to dig even deeper.
Mr. Bradford's studio is in Leimert Park, in South Central, and includes two massive spaces -- a former bar and a former nightclub -- bisected by a deep, corridorlike area that once accommodated his mother's salon. Up front, beyond the shop's waiting area, was where Mr. Bradford once kept vigil. ''My mother thought it was important that, if someone came to the door and they were a little bit aggressive, they would see a man here,'' he said. He re-enacted his stock response to such situations, pretending to stick a hot curler in a stove. ''She used to say, it was kind of like letting them know, O.K., I've got a weapon.''
In one corner is a patch of peeling linoleum whose gridlike chipped layers echo the excavated surfaces of Mr. Bradford's paintings, a fusion of abstract patterns and fliers posted by local businesses offering cash for houses and hair, DNA testing and lawyers specializing in paternity suits.
On a wall decorative dabs evoking a spray of flowers reveal Mr. Bradford's untutored handiwork. ''My mother said the ladies getting their hair washed needed to have something nice to look at,'' he explained, adding that the flowers adorned an area of wall where he would repeatedly attempt to print the names of hair treatments and their prices in neat, even rows. ''I didn't have the ability to make it perfect,'' he said. His printing would always get smaller as he ran out of room.
This desire for compositional perfection, combined with his acceptance of inevitable human failure, continues to inform works like ''Pinocchio Is on Fire'' (2010), an installation now at the Institute of Contemporary Art, where Mr. Bradford has papered a gallery's walls with rows of black paper that run off course and overlap.
In the studio's main space the din of staple guns and table saws attested to the interest in Mr. Bradford's artwork. A shipment of paintings had just left for a solo gallery show in London; another monumental painting had recently been shipped to a biennial in Seoul, South Korea.
A small show, ''Alphabet,'' featuring 26 of his works, was soon opening at the Studio Museum in Harlem. (It is on view through March 13.) And his assistants were building a crate for a work in a group show, ''The Artist's Museum,'' at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art through Jan. 31. (The museum is to host a solo show of Mr. Bradford's new work in 2013.)
The museum director, Jeffrey Deitch, said by e-mail that Mr. Bradford's work ''is not just art about art; it is art about life.''
He brings ''the daily struggles of people left behind by the American economy into his paintings,'' Mr. Deitch said.
Mr. Bradford was raised by his mother, Janice Bradford, who now lives in Atlanta; he never met his father. From age 11, he remembers sitting in the back of the shop, styling wigs and going on deli runs for customers. At 13 he began apprenticing there. After high school, he said, his mother told him, ''I don't know what you're doing with your life, but while you're figuring that out, I could use a little help.''
In his late 20s, he began taking art classes at a junior college in Santa Monica California Institute of the Arts, in Valencia. Although he continued to work at the salon, he said, ''I thought I had something else in me.'' At 31 and taking Foundation 1, however, he said he was painfully aware that ''everyone else was 18.''
''And I was so much older, and so much taller,'' he said.
During the five years it took to complete his bachelor's and master's degrees at CalArts (he finished in 1997) the art world shifted. He said graduates were more focused on a market that favored their youth. ''Hot young 22-year-olds were settling in the artsy parts of town -- Silver Lake and Echo Park,'' Mr. Bradford said.
Meanwhile, he said, he was attracted to the paintings of Jackson Pollock and writings by the Abstract Expressionist guru Clement Greenberg, both out of fashion. ''I found myself wanting to be a part of the history of Abstract Expressionism,'' he said, ''and then at the same time rejecting a lot of what it stands for.''
For two years, Mr. Bradford spent five days a week making art and two days at the salon. Eventually he laid endpapers side by side onto his paintings. Works like ''Enter and Exit the New Negro'' (2000), combining the look of Agnes Martin's abstractions with materials relating to his mother's merchant background, earned him the respect of local art insiders, who tipped off Thelma Golden, the newly appointed director of the Studio Museum in Harlem. She included Mr. Bradford's collages in her 2001 show, ''Freestyle,'' spotlighting emerging artists. ''Mark's work is significant,'' she said, ''because it defines art practice in relation to himself and his history, and also in relation to aesthetics.''
Christopher Bedford, the organizer of Mr. Bradford's traveling survey and a chief curator for the Wexner, agreed. ''By investing in the cultural history of the area he lived in, Mark has elbowed his way into the conversation about midcentury abstract painting, without ever sacrificing its expressive quality,'' he said.
Mr. Bradford has since moved to using billboards, album covers and shredded paper. (He says paper is ''a metaphor for skin.'') Large-scale paintings like ''Method Man'' and ''James Brown is Dead'' continue to affirm his fascination with African-American commerce.
Still, during a tour of his show at the Wexner, Mr. Bradford appeared restless. Was all this waxing about torn-down posters reminding him of those dreaded stereotypes? And haven't stereotypes about race driven his art from the beginning?
They have, he agreed. After all, ''something black comes in the door,'' he said. ''Then something my height comes in the door. Then, finally, Mark is like, 'Hey, I'm here too.' ''

HEADLINE: A Friend's Mistake, An Understudy's Chance

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Hempstead, N.Y.
Mo Cassara was down to his last $350. As far as he could see, he was going back upstate to tend bar at his father's restaurant and was going to need his old room.
''I was living in the graduate dorm,'' Cassara said. ''I'm an early bird. I would go down the hall to take a shower, run into students just getting back after being out all night, my room key around my neck.''
This was in the spring, when Tim Welsh, his friend, his mentor and the coach who had brought him to Hofstra University, was arrested for drunken driving and resigned.
''I've got nowhere to go,'' Cassara thought. 
Then, in the most bizarre turnaround, Cassara was hired as the head coach at Hofstra. His team has a 5-4 record after a 63-59 loss to Florida Atlantic on Saturday. Welsh is working full time for SNY network.
''I'm thankful, nobody got killed,'' Welsh said Friday.
They go back a long way, to summer camp at that basketball hotbed in Potsdam, N.Y. -- ''hockey country,'' Cassara said of the region just below the Canadian border. Yet coaches thrived there: Jerry Welsh, Tim's father, who won two Division III championships at Potsdam State; Richard Cassara, Mo's father, a former coach at St. Lawrence; Rick Carlisle, now coaching the Dallas Mavericks; Tim Welsh, the former Iona and Providence coach; and Mo Cassara.
''Tim was my counselor at camp,'' Cassara said.
Cassara, 37, was an assistant at Washington and Lee, then the Citadel; head coach at Worcester Academy; assistant at Dayton; head coach at Clark University in Division III; assistant to Al Skinner for four years at Boston College. But Skinner was fired, and Cassara hooked up with Welsh, who had gained the Hofstra job when Tom Pecora went to Fordham. Musical chairs, with human lives.
Then early one Friday in April, Welsh was discovered in his car, in the road, his alcohol level above the legal limit. Cassara had not gotten around to signing his contract at Hofstra and had been spending his money on recruiting trips. He knew he would be reimbursed, but as far as he could tell, he was unemployed.
On Saturday, he drove to Boston to close out a rented house, picked up his dogs and drove upstate. On Sunday morning, he left his dogs, stashed his belongings in his old room (''with my old foul-shooting trophies'') and told his parents, ''I'm going to be back,'' then drove to Long Island.
On Monday, Cassara and Steve DeMeo, Welsh's designated assistant head coach, and Allen Griffin, another assistant, tried to hold the squad together after a few players had already left in Pecora's wake. People noticed the effort by the coaches.
The university president, Stuart Rabinowitz, had recently closed down the hallowed football program, which was losing $4.5 million a year. Now he had more troubles.
''I talked with the seniors,'' Rabinowitz said. ''I told them I could go out and hire somebody who had been a head coach in Division I. They told me they were in love with the current staff.''
The star, Charles Jenkins, and the athletic director, Jack Hayes, kept mentioning Cassara.
On Tuesday, Hayes told Cassara to put on a suit and go meet the president. Cassara assumed he was there to assure Rabinowitz that the core of the team had not bolted.
''I had never met him,'' Cassara said. ''He turned in his chair and said, 'Tell me about yourself.' I must have talked for an hour. When I got outside, I said to Jack, 'I think that was a job interview.' I had never been interviewed for a job before.''
That night, at a booster dinner, Cassara met Jay Pomerantz, a local businessman, who later told Hayes, ''I think you've got your coach right here in this room.'' Hayes told him to put it in writing, but Rabinowitz had pretty much made his judgment.
The next day, Hofstra hired Cassara, who called his father and said he was not coming home to tend bar but was instead the new head coach of the Pride. They both cried. In fact, as Cassara told the story last week in a diner, he had tears in his eyes.
To fill out his staff, Cassara hired Gary Reynolds, a longtime college coach who had been his father's first captain at St. Lawrence. (Mo's full name is Richard Morgan Cassara, but the middle name is more a reference to his mother's maiden name, he noted.)
The new coach is wired, firing off messages at all hours with a flick of his thumb. I can envision Butch van Breda Kolff, the larger-than-life Hofstra coach of earlier times, guffawing at the concept of a coach communicating 24/7 with his players. But Butch would recognize Mo's intensity.
The whole squad works the Internet, inviting people to the games, wandering into the cafeteria, passing out tickets. Attendance is up by 600 a game, Rabinowitz said. And the next recruiting class includes Malik Nichols from Boys and Girls High in Brooklyn, a major catch.
Tim Welsh, now 50, has watched Hofstra games on television, thrilled that his friends are employed. ''It shows how classy Hofstra is,'' he said.
Asked about the arrest last April, he said: ''I regret it every day. It was an error in judgment.'' His case was resolved with a plea ''to take quick full responsibility for my mistake,'' he said. In August, Curt Gowdy Jr., an executive at SNY, signed him to work college games and in the studio; sometimes, Welsh also fills in on the Celtics shows on Comcast. Welsh and his wife, Meghan, held on to their home in East Greenwich, R.I., near the water. Their first child, a boy named Griffin, was born in August.
''Someday, it will be a teachable moment,'' Welsh said.
Welsh said he was in touch with his friends at Hofstra; Cassara seemed a little subdued when asked about the friendship.
''In some ways, I wish this had never happened,'' Cassara said. ''On one level, I wish Tim was coaching here.''
Cassara has been reunited with his dogs, is renting a house in Point Lookout, down by the ocean. When he wants a shower, he does not have to wander down the hall in the dorm, a key around his neck. He has a Division I job. His mentor is working in the business. Everybody lived.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Sports of The Times column last Sunday, about the new men's basketball coach at Hofstra University, misstated the amount of money that the Hofstra football program was losing each year before it was discontinued. It was $4.5 million, not $1 million.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Sports of The Times column on Dec. 12, about Mo Cassara, Hofstra's first-year men's basketball coach, misidentified the first captain of the team coached by Cassara's father at St. Lawrence University. The captain was Gary Reynolds -- not Wayne Morgan, a later captain who is now on Cassara's coaching staff at Hofstra. A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail on Dec. 13; this correction was delayed because The Times failed to follow up on the complaint.

HEADLINE: Full Wallets, but Using Health Program for Poor

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
AFTER immigrating to New York City from China in the 1970s, Z. Y. Tung and his wife worked hard -- he as a bank manager, she as a public school secretary -- lived frugally and saved every penny they could for the next generation.
Until five years ago, when his wife, Wen Mei Hu, racked by bone-marrow cancer, had to be put in a nursing home, where the bills ran past $100,000 a year, threatening to quickly drain the couple's life savings of $500,000. The nursing home told him not to worry: If he signed a document essentially refusing to support his wife of several decades, Medicaid, the federal insurance program for the indigent, would pick up the bill.
''What about me, because I am responsible?'' Mr. Tung inquired. He was told that only millionaires had to pay such high costs, and reluctantly, seeing no other choice, he agreed. 
Last year, more than 1,200 people in New York City officially turned their backs on their husbands and wives to qualify for Medicaid, triple the number of people five years ago. The practice, known as ''spousal refusal,'' is becoming more common as the population ages and the cost of nursing care rises -- and it is coming under increasing attack by government officials looking to curb ballooning Medicaid expenses.
In a recent report, Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitchwarned that spousal refusal could be abused as ''an entitlement for the less needy'' and urged state officials to rethink it, noting that long-term care accounts for nearly half the state's Medicaid spending.
Lawyers for the elderly argue the tactic of spousal refusal is legal nationwide, and it is most commonly used in New York and Florida, where 136 people refused to support a sick spouse last year.
Without the option of spousal refusal, lawyers say, American health care is like a ghoulish lottery. Those who need doctors' care for illnesses like cancer or heart disease are covered by Medicare, the insurance program for the elderly, while those who need more custodial care for Alzheimer's or stroke must pay for it themselves or dispose of their assets to qualify for Medicaid.
The federal government allows a healthy spouse to keep a house, a car, up to about $2,700 a month in income and up to about $110,000 in other resources. Anything above that must be spent on nursing care before Medicaid kicks in.
Nursing home care cost an average of $123,000 a year in New York City and $135,000 a year on Long Island in 2008, according to the latest available state data, or twice as much as the yearly cost of the most prestigious colleges and more than the income of all but the top 20 percent of American households.
Howard Krooks, a lawyer who practices in Boca Raton, Fla., and Rye Brook, N.Y., said spousal refusal was becoming more popular with bad economic times. ''There's no question it's playing a pivotal role in people's ability to finance long-term care,'' he said. ''They need help.''
The way it works: the healthy spouse refuses to share the marital assets, and the sick spouse assigns his or her ''right of support'' to the state. The state will then pick up the cost of nursing home care, or in New York, home health care, as well. But there is a catch: the state, through the local governments that help administer Medicaid, can sue the healthy spouse to recover the cost of the care.
That's what happened to Mr. Tung.
In April, he received a letter from the city asking him to disclose his resources so that he might ''contribute'' to the care of his wife. Mr. Tung, who is now 79 and lives in Midwood, Brooklyn, readily submitted all of his financial information, he said, because he thought that the amount of the contribution would be voluntary and he was more than willing to pay, say, $10,000 a year or so.
''I am an honest person,'' he said. ''I am willing to pay something for my wife.''
His monthly income, $2,817, was low enough. But his assets, mostly mutual funds and stocks carefully socked away over the years, came to $550,000 -- $440,000 over the limit. The city asked that he pay $270,000, the bill for five years of home care. (His wife left the nursing home after a short time.) His lawyer, Pauline Yeung-Ha, negotiated a settlement of $150,000, which Mr. Tung has paid.
If he had known this would happen, he said, he would have lived a less abstemious life. ''If I know before, long ago, I spend all the money,'' he said. ''It's very easy, very easy. Just buy a common house. It's comic, you know.''
Lawyers generally advise that even with the potential of being sued, spousal refusal makes sense because Medicaid pays less for nursing home care than private clients do.
One of Mr. Krooks's clients, an 86-year-old semiretired accountant who lives in Miami Beach, put his wife, who has Alzheimer's, in a nursing home after she became aggressive.
He had a long-term care insurance policy, but it did not cover his expenses, so he resorted to spousal refusal.
Without it, ''I would be bankrupt pretty soon,'' he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of facing a lawsuit to recover the money.
While many state and local governments do not openly acknowledge the spousal refusal option, New York City actually provides a form letter for it.
''When families come in and I reveal they could use spousal refusal, it's as if I've just lifted 10 pounds off their shoulders,'' said Judith Grimaldi, Ms. Yeung-Ha's partner in the Brooklyn law firm Grimaldi and Yeung.
Although some politicians, like Thomas R. Suozzi, a former Nassau County executive, who attacked spousal refusal as a Democratic primary candidate for governor in 2006, have charged that the tactic is abused by ''millionaires,'' New York City officials say that is seldom the case.
Almost every time a New Yorker exercises the option of spousal refusal, lawyers from the Human Resources Administration review the applications and seek to recover money when appropriate, said Carmen Boon, a spokeswoman for the agency.
In 2005, the city worked on 394 cases and collected $1.5 million; in 2009, there were 1,258 cases, and the city collected $3.7 million.
''The number of cases the city pursued was a good reflection of the number filed each year,'' Ms. Boon said. ''But the city recovered from only a fraction of those, because in most cases the spouse does not have the financial means to allow any significant contribution.''
Mr. Ravitch said in an interview that he favored stricter review of spousal refusal cases, with some discretion built into the system to account, for instance, for cases in which the healthy spouse ''has a very long life expectancy and didn't have the resources to take care of their own health for the remainder of their lives.''
Governor-elect Andrew M. Cuomo, whose support would be needed for any changes, declined to comment.
Lawyers within the New York State Bar Association who represent the elderly have proposed a compromise system. It would allow people to negotiate a payment plan with the state, in which they would pledge to pay a ''fair share'' of their spouses' nursing home costs -- perhaps half their assets -- while keeping enough for their own living expenses, Mr. Krooks said. There are plans to try out a version of this system upstate.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about people who officially refuse to support their spouses in order to qualify for Medicaid gave an imprecise comparison of the cost of nursing home care and college tuition. While nursing home care in the New York area is indeed twice as much as the yearly cost of the most prestigious colleges, the cost of the colleges includes room and board, not just tuition.

HEADLINE: Propping Up a Drug Lord, Then Arresting Him

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Hajji Juma Khan was arrested and transported to New York to face charges under a new American narco-terrorism law in 2008, federal prosecutors described him as perhaps the biggest and most dangerous drug lord in Afghanistan, a shadowy figure who had helped keep the Taliban in business with a steady stream of money and weapons.
But what the government did not say was that Mr. Juma Khan was also a longtime American informer, who provided information about the Taliban, Afghan corruption and other drug traffickers. Central Intelligence Agency officers and Drug Enforcement Administration agents relied on him as a valued source for years, even as he was building one of Afghanistan's biggest drug operations after the United States-led invasion of the country, according to current and former American officials. Along the way, he was also paid a large amount of cash by the United States.
At the height of his power, Mr. Juma Khan was secretly flown to Washington for a series of clandestine meetings with C.I.A. and D.E.A. officials in 2006. Even then, the United States was receiving reports that he was on his way to becoming Afghanistan's most important narcotics trafficker by taking over the drug operations of his rivals and paying off Taliban leaders and corrupt politicians in President Hamid Karzai's government. 
In a series of videotaped meetings in Washington hotels, Mr. Juma Khan offered tantalizing leads to the C.I.A. and D.E.A., in return for what he hoped would be protected status as an American asset, according to American officials. And then, before he left the United States, he took a side trip to New York to see the sights and do some shopping, according to two people briefed on the case.
The relationship between the United States government and Mr. Juma Khan is another illustration of how the war on drugs and the war on terrorism have sometimes collided, particularly in Afghanistan, where drug dealing, the insurgency and the government often overlap.
To be sure, American intelligence has worked closely with figures other than Mr. Juma Khan suspected of drug trade ties, including Ahmed Wali Karzai, the president's half brother, and Hajji Bashir Noorzai, who was arrested in 2005. Mr. Karzai has denied being involved in the drug trade.
A Shifting Policy
Afghan drug lords have often been useful sources of information about the Taliban. But relying on them has also put the United States in the position of looking the other way as these informers ply their trade in a country that by many accounts has become a narco-state.
The case of Mr. Juma Khan also shows how counternarcotics policy has repeatedly shifted during the nine-year American occupation of Afghanistan, getting caught between the conflicting priorities of counterterrorism and nation building, so much so that Mr. Juma Khan was never sure which way to jump, according to officials who spoke on the condition that they not be identified.
When asked about Mr. Juma Khan's relationship with the C.I.A., a spokesman for the spy agency said that the ''C.I.A. does not, as a rule, comment on matters pending before U.S. courts.'' A D.E.A. spokesman also declined to comment on his agency's relationship with Mr. Juma Khan.
His New York lawyer, Steven Zissou, denied that Mr. Juma Khan had ever supported the Taliban or worked for the C.I.A.
''There have been many things said about Hajji Juma Khan,'' Mr. Zissou said, ''and most of what has been said, including that he worked for the C.I.A., is false. What is true is that H. J. K. has never been an enemy of the United States and has never supported the Taliban or any other group that threatens Americans.''
A spokeswoman for the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which is handling Mr. Juma Khan's prosecution, declined to comment.
However, defending the relationship, one American official said, ''You're not going to get intelligence in a war zone from Ward Cleaver or Florence Nightingale.''
At first, Mr. Juma Khan, an illiterate trafficker in his mid-50s from Afghanistan's remote Nimroz Province, in the border region where southwestern Afghanistan meets both Iran and Pakistan, was a big winner from the American-led invasion. He had been a provincial drug smuggler in southwestern Afghanistan in the 1990s, when the Taliban governed the country. But it was not until after the Taliban's ouster that he rose to national prominence, taking advantage of a record surge in opium production in Afghanistan after the invasion.
Briefly detained by American forces after the 2001 fall of the Taliban, he was quickly released, even though American officials knew at the time that he was involved in narcotics trafficking, according to several current and former American officials. During the first few years of its occupation of Afghanistan, the United States was focused entirely on capturing or killing leaders of Al Qaeda, and it ignored drug trafficking, because American military commanders believed that policing drugs got in the way of their core counterterrorism mission.
Opium and heroin production soared, and the narcotics trade came to account for nearly half of the Afghan economy.
Concerns, but No Action
By 2004, Mr. Juma Khan had gained control over routes from southern Afghanistan to Pakistan's Makran Coast, where heroin is loaded onto freighters for the trip to the Middle East, as well as overland routes through western Afghanistan to Iran and Turkey. To keep his routes open and the drugs flowing, he lavished bribes on all the warring factions, from the Taliban to the Pakistani intelligence service to the Karzai government, according to current and former American officials.
The scale of his drug organization grew to stunning levels, according to the federal indictment against him. It was in both the wholesale and the retail drug businesses, providing raw materials for other drug organizations while also processing finished drugs on its own.
Bush administration officials first began to talk about him publicly in 2004, when Robert B. Charles, then the assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement, told Time magazine that Mr. Juma Khan was a drug lord ''obviously very tightly tied to the Taliban.''
Such high-level concern did not lead to any action against Mr. Juma Khan. But Mr. Noorzai, one of his rivals, was lured to New York and arrested in 2005, which allowed Mr. Juma Khan to expand his empire.
In a 2006 confidential report to the drug agency reviewed by The New York Times, an Afghan informer stated that Mr. Juma Khan was working with Ahmed Wali Karzai, the political boss of southern Afghanistan, to take control of the drug trafficking operations left behind by Mr. Noorzai. Some current and former American counternarcotics officials say they believe that Mr. Karzai provided security and protection for Mr. Juma Khan's operations.
Mr. Karzai denied any involvement with the drug trade and said that he had never met Mr. Juma Khan. ''I have never even seen his face,'' he said through a spokesman. He denied having any business or security arrangement with him. ''Ask them for proof instead of lies,'' he added.
Mr. Juma Khan's reported efforts to take over from Mr. Noorzai came just as he went to Washington to meet with the C.I.A. and the drug agency, former American officials say. By then, Mr. Juma Khan had been working as an informer for both agencies for several years, officials said. He had met repeatedly with C.I.A. officers in Afghanistan beginning in 2001 or 2002, and had also developed a relationship with the drug agency's country attache in Kabul, former American officials say.
He had been paid large amounts of cash by the United States, according to people with knowledge of the case. Along with other tribal leaders in his region, he was given a share of as much as $2 million in payments to help oppose the Taliban. The payments are said to have been made by either the C.I.A. or the United States military.
The 2006 Washington meetings were an opportunity for both sides to determine, in face-to-face talks, whether they could take their relationship to a new level of even longer-term cooperation.
''I think this was an opportunity to drill down and see what he would be able to provide,'' one former American official said. ''I think it was kind of like saying, 'O.K., what have you got?' ''
Business, Not Ideology
While the C.I.A. wanted information about the Taliban, the drug agency had its own agenda for the Washington meetings -- information about other Afghan traffickers Mr. Juma Khan worked with, as well as contacts on the supply lines through Turkey and Europe.
One reason the Americans could justify bringing Mr. Juma Khan to Washington was that they claimed to have no solid evidence that he was smuggling drugs into the United States, and there were no criminal charges pending against him in this country.
It is not clear how much intelligence Mr. Juma Khan provided on other drug traffickers or on the Taliban leadership. But the relationship between the C.I.A. and the D.E.A. and Mr. Juma Khan continued for some time after the Washington sessions, officials say.
In fact, when the drug agency contacted him again in October 2008 to invite him to another meeting, he went willingly, believing that the Americans wanted to continue the discussions they had with him in Washington. He even paid his own way to Jakarta, Indonesia, to meet with the agency, current and former officials said.
But this time, instead of enjoying fancy hotels and friendly talks, Mr. Juma Khan was arrested and flown to New York, and this time he was not allowed to go shopping.
It is unclear why the government decided to go after Mr. Juma Khan. Some officials suggest that he never came through with breakthrough intelligence. Others say that he became so big that he was hard to ignore, and that the United States shifted its priorities to make pursuing drug dealers a higher priority.
The Justice Department has used a 2006 narco-terrorism law against Mr. Juma Khan, one that makes it easier for American prosecutors to go after foreign drug traffickers who are not smuggling directly into the United States if the government can show they have ties to terrorist organizations.
The federal indictment shows that the drug agency eventually got a cooperating informer who could provide evidence that Mr. Juma Khan was making payoffs to the Taliban to keep his drug operation going, something intelligence operatives had known for years.
The federal indictment against Mr. Juma Khan said the payments were ''in exchange for protection for the organization's drug trafficking operations.'' The alleged payoffs were what linked him to the Taliban and permitted the government to make its case.
But even some current and former American counternarcotics officials are skeptical of the government's claims that Mr. Juma Khan was a strong supporter of the Taliban.
''He was not ideological,'' one former official said. ''He made payments to them. He made payments to government officials. It was part of the business.''
Now, plea negotiations are quietly under way. A plea bargain might keep many of the details of his relationship to the United States out of the public record.

HEADLINE: If Bill Clinton Was President

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- By the end of last week, it certainly looked as if Barack Obama had outsourced his presidency to Bill Clinton. First, he cut a Clintonian-style deal with Republicans on tax cuts and then he literally turned over the White House lectern to his predecessor.
Equally riveting and astonishing, Mr. Clinton's blast-from-the-past performance in the White House briefing room on Friday afternoon reinforced the impression of political deja vu, the sense that once again a Democratic president humbled by midterm elections was pivoting to the center at the expense of his own supporters.
But as no less an authority than Mr. Clinton reminded us, the comparison is incomplete and imperfect. ''The story line is how well we worked with the Republicans and all that,'' he said during his brief West Wing comeback. ''But you know, we played political kabuki for a year.'' 
Indeed, the real history of his response to the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 was more complicated than the reductionist version. And so far, Mr. Obama's response to the November elections has been more complicated as well. The current president's uncomfortable tax compromise with Republicans harked back to only one aspect of Mr. Clinton's recovery strategy in 1995 and 1996, although the howls of protest from the left must have sounded familiar to the visiting former chief executive. Mr. Clinton's approach involved as much confrontation as conciliation, and most of all, improvisation.
Even in the few weeks since the Republican election victory, Mr. Obama has already sampled from the full menu of options. On the tax cuts, he concluded that he had little choice but to cut a deal with Republicans, conceding to them one of their core priorities and angering his own supporters even as he squeezed out of the opposition as many concessions as he could to balance the agreement.
But faced with Republican resistance to his New Start arms control treaty, Mr. Obama took a different tack, refusing to back down and wait until next year. Instead, he organized a sustained, high-profile campaign to pressure Republican senators into approving the pact before year's end and now appears to have the votes if the Senate can schedule enough time to debate.
''Sometimes you're going to tack this way or that way,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director. ''Sometimes that means that the best way to get to that North Star is working with the other party and looking for compromise, and other times it's going to require confrontation.''
It's worth remembering that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama are strikingly different figures. Mr. Clinton was a Southern governor who had defined his political identity in part as an apostle of moving his party to the political middle, while Mr. Obama is from the urban north and came to office presenting himself as a pragmatist, but not necessarily a centrist, and has ushered in the most sweeping liberal policy initiatives in years.
Their circumstances were different as well -- the 1990s ultimately were a decade of relative peace and prosperity, while so far Mr. Obama's tenure has been marked by two persistent wars and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The Republican sweep in 1994 was more of a shock to Democrats, who had held the House for 40 years. Mr. Obama saw this year's defeat coming and appears less off balance than did Mr. Clinton. And Newt Gingrich was the driving force behind the successful Republican insurgency, while today's Congressional leaders are mainly the beneficiaries of it.
After the 1994 election, Mr. Clinton flailed for months, secretly bringing in the Republican adviser, Dick Morris, without telling his current advisers as he searched for a way forward.
''He was lost, he was completely lost,'' recalled Robert Reich, a longtime Clinton friend who served as labor secretary. ''He just didn't know what to do. It was a real crisis.''
Douglas B. Sosnik, who was Mr. Clinton's White House political director, said the first phase of recovery was mainly about dealing with shock. ''It took us six months to regain our internal footing,'' he said.
Mr. Clinton's lowest postelection moment arguably came less than 24 hours before he began his comeback. In April 1995, he was reduced to arguing at a news conference that ''the president is relevant.'' The next day, bombers blew up an Oklahoma City federal building, and Mr. Clinton's steady, reassuring and empathetic response made him more of a national leader.
Mr. Sosnik identified two other phases that followed. Phase 2, he said, was spent ''getting our theory of the case on how we were going to deal with this new reality,'' and really started when Mr. Clinton proposed balancing the budget in hopes of outflanking the Republicans. Phase 3, he said, came in the fall of 1995, when Mr. Clinton engaged Republicans over the role of government, ultimately refusing to agree to deeper spending cuts and winning the spin battle over who was responsible for government shutdowns.
Mr. Clinton had coopted Republican issues but on his own terms, picking selective fights that left them looking extreme. Even one of his most memorable compromises with Republicans, legislation overhauling the welfare system, came only after he vetoed the first two versions, saying they went too far.
The shorthand more than a decade later boils this down to ''triangulation,'' Mr. Morris's term for separating from the ideological wings of both parties to recapture the middle. That left a bad taste among Democrats that persists to this day, helping to explain the visceral outrage over the tax cut deal.
Mr. Obama's advisers insist that that is not what he is up to. ''A lot of people say, 'Aha, he's triangulating,' which is absolutely not what he's doing,'' said Mr. Pfeiffer. ''There's a lot to learn from what the Clinton White House did in 1994 forward with a similar situation. But it's also important to understand we're not in the exact same situation.''
Still, it's a measure of Mr. Obama's uncertainty in this moment of peril that he would summon not only the spirit but also the person of Mr. Clinton, whom he disparaged during the 2008 campaign for small-ball politics that made him less of a transformational president than Ronald Reagan. Lately, Mr. Obama has been reading accounts of Mr. Clinton's presidency.
In applying the lessons, Mr. Obama might find areas for cooperation and conflict. The president and Congressional Republicans could find common ground on issues like education reform and alternative energy. They could clash on spending, environmental regulation and any attempt to repeal Mr. Obama's health care program.
Whether he can turn that into a formula for political resurrection in an era of 9.8 percent unemployment is unclear. Mr. Pfeiffer speculated on what it would be like to find in his West Wing desk George Stephanopoulos's old playbook. ''It would be a mistake to take it out and run all the same plays,'' Mr. Pfeiffer said. ''It would also be a mistake to throw it away.''

HEADLINE: What Progressives Don't Understand About Obama

BYLINE: By ISHMAEL REED. 
Ishmael Reed is the author of the forthcoming novel ''Juice.''

 BODY:
Oakland, Calif.
NOT all of my white teachers viewed me as a discipline problem. To the annoyance of my fellow students, one teacher selected me regularly to lead assembly programs. A high school teacher insisted that I learn about the theater. She was an America-firster who supplied me with right-wing pamphlets and magazines that I'd read at breakfast and she didn't seem bothered by my returning them with some of the pages stuck together with syrup.
But most of them did see me as an annoyance, and gave me the grades to prove it. 
I've been thinking recently of all those D's for deportment on my report cards. I thought of them, for instance, when I read a response to an essay I had written about Mark Twain that appeared in ''A New Literary History of America.'' One of the country's leading critics, who writes for a prominent progressive blog, called the essay ''rowdy,'' which I interpreted to mean ''lack of deportment.'' Perhaps this was because I cited ''Huckleberry Finn'' to show that some white women managed household slaves, a departure from the revisionist theory that sees Scarlett O'Hara as some kind of feminist martyr.
I thought of them when I pointed out to a leading progressive that the Tea Party included neo-Nazis and Holocaust deniers -- and he called me a ''bully.'' He believes that the Tea Party is a grass-roots uprising against Wall Street, a curious reading since the movement gained its impetus from a rant against the president delivered by a television personality on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
And I've thought about them as I've listened in the last week to progressives criticize President Obama for keeping his cool.
Progressives have been urging the president to ''man up'' in the face of the Republicans. Some want him to be like John Wayne. On horseback. Slapping people left and right.
One progressive commentator played an excerpt from a Harry Truman speech during which Truman screamed about the Republican Party to great applause. He recommended this style to Mr. Obama. If President Obama behaved that way, he'd be dismissed as an angry black militant with a deep hatred of white people. His grade would go from a B- to a D.
What the progressives forget is that black intellectuals have been called ''paranoid,'' ''bitter,'' ''rowdy,'' ''angry,'' ''bullies,'' and accused of tirades and diatribes for more than 100 years. Very few of them would have been given a grade above D from most of my teachers.
When these progressives refer to themselves as Mr. Obama's base, all they see is themselves. They ignore polls showing steadfast support for the president among blacks and Latinos. And now they are whispering about a primary challenge against the president. Brilliant! The kind of suicidal gesture that destroyed Jimmy Carter -- and a way to lose the black vote forever.
Unlike white progressives, blacks and Latinos are not used to getting it all. They know how it feels to be unemployed and unable to buy your children Christmas presents. They know when not to shout. The president, the coolest man in the room, who worked among the unemployed in Chicago, knows too.

HEADLINE: The Nerve To Say No

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
DECIDING what to do with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the taxpayer-owned mortgage giants that helped set the financial crisis in motion, will be a huge job for Congress next year.
The man in the middle of that melee is likely to be Joseph A. Smith Jr., the commissioner of banks for North Carolina since 2002. In November, the Obama administration nominated him to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Fannie and Freddie's regulator.
Last Thursday, Mr. Smith's confirmation hearing took place. Beyond prepared remarks, Mr. Smith said little at the brief and sparsely attended hearing. Richard Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, questioned Mr. Smith about his plans for the agency and asked him to reply in writing. On Tuesday, the committee will consider the nomination.
Mr. Smith's bona fides are many. He has both industry and regulatory experience: before he became commissioner, he was a lawyer in private practice and a general counsel for Centura Banks, now a unit of RBC Bank. 
When he has testified before Congress in recent years, he has shown a keen interest in saving taxpayers from institutions that are too large and interconnected to be allowed to fail.
In March 2009 for example, he told the Senate Banking Committee: ''As we work through a federal response to this financial crisis, we need to carry forward a renewed understanding that the concentration of financial power and a lack of transparency are not in the long-term interests of our financial system, our economic system or our democracy.''
Amen.
If this Mr. Smith goes to Washington as head of F.H.F.A., he will face a monumental challenge at a crucial time: how to protect taxpayers from even greater losses incurred by Fannie and Freddie as Congress considers what to do with the companies. Since they collapsed into conservatorship in September 2008, Fannie and Freddie have received $151 billion in taxpayer assistance. More will almost certainly be needed.
Because subsidizing housing through Fannie and Freddie is a time-honored tradition in Washington, Mr. Smith is sure to encounter enormous political interference as he walks the tightrope of overseeing the mortgage giants and working with Congress to determine their fate.
Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Smith declined to comment last week on his plans for the two companies because the confirmation process is still going on.
This year, Edward J. DeMarco, the acting director of F.H.F.A. and a career public servant, has done an admirable job of trying to minimize taxpayer losses generated by the companies. He has been forceful in demanding that banks buy back dubious loans they sold to Fannie and Freddie during the mortgage mania.
Mr. DeMarco's agency also issued subpoenas last July to institutions that packaged mortgages into securities that were sold to Fannie and Freddie. Although the materials received through those subpoenas have not been disclosed, the subpoenas themselves made it clear that Mr. DeMarco was eager to go after anybody who might have offloaded sketchy loans onto taxpayers.
Mr. DeMarco is staying on at the agency as its chief operating officer after the new director arrives. And if Mr. Smith becomes the director, it is imperative that he also keep applying Mr. DeMarco's buyback pressure on the banks.
MR. SMITH would also do well to follow another of Mr. DeMarco's leads: pushing back against the growing chorus of groups arguing for an explicit government guarantee of all mortgages going forward. After what we have been through, isn't it incredible that anyone could argue for government guarantees of all mortgages? Yet that's just one of the many perverse ''solutions'' that have been floated in the aftermath of the crisis.
''The proposals are all similar,'' said Edward Pinto, former chief credit officer at Fannie Mae in the late 1980s and a real estate finance consultant and resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. ''They say the private mortgage market cannot exist without some type of explicit guarantee, that the government will be the catastrophic backstop and that it will be well-capitalized. But the problem with guarantees is the private sector ends up benefiting from the gains while sticking taxpayers with the losses.''
In addition to shielding taxpayers from having to backstop an ever-expanding financial safety net for errant bankers, we also need protection from ballooning losses at Fannie and Freddie. This will require the F.H.F.A. to take other crucial steps.
Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance, a consulting firm in Chicago, has provided a to-do list for officials at F.H.F.A.
In a presentation to the agency's supervision summit meeting last Wednesday in Washington, Ms. Tavakoli said that if the agency hoped to determine the credit risk lurking inside Fannie and Freddie, it needed to ascertain two things: the probability of default on those loans and the loss rates when probable defaults actually occur.
''They have to do their own statistical sampling of their portfolios to get a realistic idea of what those numbers are,'' Ms. Tavakoli said in an interview. ''And it has to be rigorous because we don't know what kinds of impairments to expect from risky new mortgage products combined with a damaged economy and housing market.''
The F.H.F.A. cannot rely on estimates from the credit ratings agencies about the extent of those losses, Ms. Tavakoli said. ''The whole idea of relying on third parties has not worked,'' she said. ''Once you feel better about the quality of your information, you'll feel more confident about making your next decision.''
She also advised the F.H.F.A. to conduct a thorough fraud audit on the portfolios held by Fannie and Freddie to identify any improprieties that may have been involved in the loans the companies purchased.
''Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have inherited a system that is hostile toward them fixing this mess,'' Ms. Tavakoli said. ''They need to stand up to the pressure they are going to get from Congress to give imprudent loans to people to provide a fake stimulus to the economy. But it didn't work before and it won't work now.''
In an interview Friday, Mr. DeMarco said: ''I recognize that the policy discussion about the future of housing finance will be difficult and may take a while. If there were easy answers, we would have put them out there by now. But the key job for F.H.F.A. is to ensure that the functioning of the enterprises in conservatorship continues and that new business they take on is safe and sound while this takes place.''
IT could not be clearer that should Mr. Smith win the leadership of the F.H.F.A., he'll have to stand up for the taxpayer. That also means he will have to stand against increasingly powerful banks that -- despite the magnitude of the crisis -- have managed to avoid, circumvent or co-opt policy makers, law enforcement officials and regulators.

HEADLINE: The Fed? He's Not a Fan.

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has been attacked for failing to foresee the financial crisis, for bailing out Wall Street, and, most recently, for injecting an additional $600 billion into the banking system to give the slow recovery a boost.
But Mr. Bernanke will face even more scrutiny in the months to come. On Thursday, House Republican leaders announced that Representative Ron Paul of Texas, the outspoken Republican libertarian who ran for president in 2008, will become the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees the Fed. His position on the central bank is captured in the title of his 2009 book, ''End the Fed'' (Grand Central Publishing). 
Here's some of what he wrote:
The Beginning of the End
''The day the Fed came into being in 1913 may have been the beginning of the end, but the powers it obtained and the mischief it caused took a long time to become a serious issue and a concern for average Americans.''
The Gold Standard
''Whenever I talk of a gold standard, there are always people ready to accuse me of having some obsession or fixation. Fetish is a word thrown around. In fact, I'm only observing reality: the idea of sound money in most of human history has been bound up with gold money.''
A Full-Time Counterfeiting Operation
On Mr. Bernanke: ''There is something fishy about the head of the world's most powerful government bureaucracy, one that is involved in a full-time counterfeiting operation to sustain monopolistic financial cartels, and the world's most powerful central planner, who sets the price of money worldwide, proclaiming the glories of capitalism.''
New Money Out of Thin Air
''Only the Federal Reserve can inflate the currency, creating new money and credit out of thin air, in secrecy, without oversight or supervision. Inflation facilitates deficits, needless wars and excessive welfare spending.''
Fed Chairmen He Has Known
''Being in Congress in the late 1970s and early 1980s and serving on the House Banking Committee, I met and got to question several Federal Reserve chairmen: Arthur Burns, G. William Miller and Paul Volcker. Of the three, I had the most interaction with Volcker. He was more personable and smarter than the others, including the more recent board chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke.''
Low Interest Rates
''Artificially low interest rates are achieved by inflating the money supply, and they penalize the thrifty and cheat those who save. They promote consumption and borrowing over savings and investing. Manipulating interest rates is an immoral act. It's economically destructive.''
The Bailouts
''Today, there is no principled opposition to the corporate bailouts and the Fed's trillions of dollars of new credit and the takeover of insurance, mortgages, medical care, banks and the auto industry. The arguments have only been over amounts, financial vehicles, and which political group gets to wield the economic power. If there is no moral argument against the economic takeover of America, there will be no resistance to the dictator who rules over our lives with an iron fist.''
The Obama Legacy
''For the same reason a disease cannot be cured by more of the germ that caused it, the inflation and debt accumulation of the Obama years will not inflate our way out of it. This depression will likely last and last.''
Correction: December 19, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about Representative Ron Paul, a Texas Republican who is in line to become head of the subcommittee that oversees the Federal Reserve, transposed two of the digits in one of the decades in which he served on the House Banking Committee. It was during the early 1980s, not the 1908s.

HEADLINE: One Billionaire Bows Out Of the Next America's Cup

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 BODY:
Ten months after Larry Ellison and his BMW Oracle Racing team, lawyers included, celebrated victory over Alinghi in the America's Cup, it remains uncertain where BMW Oracle will defend its very expensive prize.
What is clear is that wherever the competition lands in 2013 -- whether in San Francisco or some other city -- the Alinghi owner, Ernesto Bertarelli, will not be renewing his acrimonious rivalry with Ellison.
Last month, Bertarelli, a Swiss billionaire, announced that Alinghi would not take part in the next America's Cup. Last week, in a telephone interview from Switzerland, he spoke publicly for the first time about his reasons.
''The conditions set by BMW Oracle just make it impossible for us to be competitive,'' he said. ''In any sport, if you don't have at least a small chance of winning, there's no point in participating. That's my philosophy.'' 
Alinghi, representing the Swiss yacht club Societe Nautique de Geneve, or SNG, won the Cup on its first attempt in 2003 in New Zealand after hiring several of New Zealand's best sailors, including the skipper Russell Coutts, the leading helmsman of the Cup's modern era. Though Coutts later left Alinghi after a dispute with Bertarelli, Alinghi successfully defended the Cup in 2007 in Valencia, Spain.
But after Bertarelli picked a fledgling Spanish yacht club as an official challenger and issued a controversial set of rules for the next Cup, Ellison, with Coutts now in his employ, started a series of legal counterattacks that forced Alinghi to accept BMW Oracle, which represents San Francisco's Golden Gate Yacht Club, as its challenger of record.
After the teams failed to agree on terms for a conventional multiple-challenger regatta, Alinghi and BMW Oracle faced off in a one-on-one Cup in huge multihulls in Valencia in February. Ellison's team, racing in the 90-by-90-foot trimaran USA-17, swept the series, in part because of the power boost provided by its innovative 223-foot wing sail, complete with adjustable flaps like an airplane wing. It gave USA-17 an edge over the soft sails of Alinghi's catamaran.
BMW Oracle has since decided that the 2013 Cup, the 34th, will be contested in a new class of 72-foot catamarans with wing sails, putting an end -- for now -- to the Cup's monohull era. A deadline of Dec. 31 is in place to choose a site, with San Francisco still the prime candidate. But it is far from a sure thing because of governmental divisions over the potential costs. Golden Gate Yacht Club is applying pressure on the city to reach an agreement by the end of this week or risk losing the Cup to another site, potentially Newport, R.I., or Italy, home to the primary challenger Mascalzone Latino.
Challengers have until the end of March to enter, and three teams have been confirmed publicly: Mascalzone Latino, Artemis Racing of Sweden and the syndicate Aleph-Equipe de France. Iain Murray, the regatta director for the Cup, said a fourth challenger had been ''entered and validated'' for over a month without announcing itself. Others are expected to enter once the site is confirmed.
There were 11 challengers at the last full-scale Cup in 2007, and Bertarelli said the relatively low number of entries so far was an indictment of BMW Oracle's approach to this Cup; he said adding more teams now would not change the equation.
''How can anyone be competitive with so little time left and no experience whatsoever on wings?'' he said. ''It's not possible. It's like if you say, 'Wait until March and I'll show you the big party I'm going to organize at the bottom of Everest' and see how many people I can get together. The question is who is going to get to the top of the mountain? I've been on the top. I know how hard it is to get there.''
Coutts has suggested that the decision to use a smaller one-design catamaran with a wing for preliminary America's Cup competitions in 2011 was an attempt to help challengers bridge the gap. But some prominent teams have declined to take the bait. Team New Zealand, which contested the 2007 Cup match against Alinghi, is struggling to find financing. Team Origin, a British syndicate formed after the 2007 Cup, remained intact through the legal wrangling only to announce it would disband after the terms of the 2013 Cup were declared.
Bertarelli, an experienced multihull sailor, said his issue was not with multihulls but with the wing and the terms of engagement, which he said could allow Ellison, whose billions exceed his, to spend whatever was required to ensure victory.
''The use of a wing instead of a traditional sail plan,'' Bertarelli said, ''is going to make it very difficult from a design standpoint, very impractical from a logistics standpoint and, more importantly, very, very expensive for any team to participate.''
He said he was convinced that recreational sailors would not make use of wing sails in their own yachts. ''I think it's the wrong choice, and it's a choice they made on their own mainly for one reason: to be guaranteed a lead advantage and to make it as difficult as they can for anyone else to win,'' Bertarelli said of Ellison's team.
BMW Oracle declined to comment on Bertarelli's claims, saying the team had ''no interest'' in dredging up past disputes.
But Coutts has said there was consultation with potential challengers and designers before the decision to use multihulls was made. Murray said the wing sail has been a consistent hit with sailors who have raced with it in different events, including the 1988 America's Cup.
''Every one of those crew that has been involved in those projects, it was sort of like someone turning the lights on,'' said Murray, who praised the maneuverability the wing provides.
He conceded that wing sails might not become part of cruising yachts. ''But who's to say they are not going to become a vital, green eco part of adding another dimension to commercial shipping?'' he said.
Murray is also the chief executive of America's Cup Race Management, the ostensibly independent organization created to stage the Cup and the preliminary regattas scheduled for 2011 and 2012.
But Bertarelli said that after a careful reading of the protocol for the next Cup, he was convinced that real control lay with BMW Oracle. The same type of criticism was leveled against Bertarelli in 2007 after SNG released its initial protocol -- Ellison said he thought it was ''a joke'' when it was first e-mailed to him.
That was not Bertarelli's reaction to this set of rules. ''It is a very smart piece of legal work which had a lot of words that were there only for communication purposes,'' he said. ''There are a lot of pages about how fantastic and fair the event will be, but if you actually dissect the document and take all the nice words away, it's a very clever legal engineering whereby they have total control over the event and the competition.''
Murray disagreed. ''America's Cup Race Management, which has control over all the racing and many aspects of the whole event, is independent as independent can be,'' he said.
Bertarelli said he estimated that to mount a competitive campaign in this cup over three years would require a budget of more than $100 million. He said he spent roughly that much in 2007 but was able to finance about 80 percent through sponsorship.
''It's a design project more than a sailing race,'' he said of the 2013 Cup. ''And in today's economy, it's ludicrous to be spending this kind of money on a sport without the sponsorship revenues that we could have had some years ago. I think the commercial equation is just not there, and that's one of the reasons I'm pulling out also, besides the advantage they have retained.''

HEADLINE: LENDERS RETURN TO BIG MAILINGS ON CREDIT CARDS

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Credit card offers are surging again after a three-year slowdown, as banks seek to revive a business that brought them huge profits before the financial crisis wrecked the credit scores of so many Americans.
The rise is striking because it includes offers to riskier borrowers who were shunned as recently as six months ago. But this time, in contrast to the boom years, when banks ''preapproved'' seemingly everyone, lenders are choosing their prospects more carefully and setting stricter terms to guard against another wave of losses.
For consumers, the resurgence of card offers, however cautious, provides an opportunity to repair damaged credit and regain the convenience of paying with plastic. But there is a catch: the new cards have higher interest rates and annual fees.
Lenders are ''tiptoeing their way back into the higher-risk pool of customers,'' said John Ulzheimer, president of consumer education at SmartCredit.com. 
In extending credit again to riskier borrowers, lenders are looking beyond standard credit scores, on the theory that some people who may seem to be equivalent credit risks on the surface may show differences in spending or other behavior -- like registering on a job Web site -- that suggest variations in their ability to keep up with payments.
Industry consultants, in their attempt to feed the demand for finer classifications of borrowers, have coined new labels to describe different borrowers with similar credit scores.
One is ''strategic defaulters,'' whose credit scores were damaged because they walked away from a home when its value dropped below what was owed on the mortgage. These borrowers made a bad bet on real estate but may otherwise be prudent risks because they make a good living.
Similarly, ''first-time defaulters'' once had a strong credit record but ran into financial trouble during the recession. Typically, these borrowers fell behind on some sort of loan payment after losing a job, not from taking on too much debt.
By contrast, there are ''sloppy payers,'' who pay only some bills on time; ''abusers,'' who are defiant about paying; and ''distressed borrowers,'' who simply do not have the means to pay.
The goal is to weed out the latter groups to identify consumers whose credit scores are blemished but who still have the money to pay their bills.
''Lenders want to prove to themselves that it is worth taking a higher risk,'' said Brad Jolson, an executive of the decision management company FICO, who has helped several card companies analyze their customer base.
This new approach to assessing default risk is emblematic of the challenge faced by the many banks that were hobbled by the financial crisis: They desperately want to grow again, but the memory of a near-death experience makes them wary about taking outsize risks.
Lenders have taken $189 billion in credit card losses since 2007, according to Oliver Wyman Group, a financial consultancy. That was a significant part of the $2 trillion or so that banks are estimated to have lost since the crisis began, and a contributor to the government bailout of the banking system.
To stem losses, lenders halted new card offers to all but their most affluent customers. At the same time, more than eight million consumers stopped using their credit cards, in a sign of the nationwide belt-tightening, according to TransUnion, the credit bureau. Millions more borrowers who still have cards have been compelled to pay down their balances, or are more often choosing to use cash.
That has had a big impact on lenders' bottom lines. Credit cards once gave the banking industry as much as a quarter of its profits; today those profits have all but vanished and lenders are seeking ways to replace them.
Now that the losses have stabilized, lenders have set out to revive their card businesses, and mail offers to riskier borrowers are roaring back.
HSBC mailed more than 16 million card offers to this group in the third quarter of this year, Citigroup 14 million and Discover 10 million, all roughly tenfold increases over the same period last year, according to Synovate Mail Monitor, a market research firm. Capital One's rate rose fiftyfold, to 22 million.
Many of the new lower-end cards start with high interest rates and annual fees, because new federal rules limit the ability of lenders to change the terms after payments are missed. Capital One, for example, is offering low-end cards that carry interest rates of 18 percent or higher and annual fees of up to $50.
In all, lenders will send about 2.5 billion credit card offers by the end of the year, Synovate estimates, compared with more than six billion in 2005, the peak year. The bulk of this year's mailings are still going to affluent people, with just 17 percent going to borrowers with blemished credit. That compares with about 39 percent in 2007 and a low of 7 percent in late 2009.
The response to the card campaigns has been strong, with roughly 4 percent of these riskier borrowers submitting applications. That is about 10 times the typical response rate for the group, though that may be partly explained by the absence of offers over the last two years.
After racking up more than $17,000 in credit card charges, Sue Talkington, 69, a retired saw mill worker living in Modesto, Calif., started working with a credit counselor in September to start paying down her debt.
Then, last month, right after she had cut up three credit cards, she received an application for a new Capital One card, the second pre-approved mail offer she has received recently.
She says she was stunned. ''I'm trying to get out of debt, so why would I want a credit card to get into more debt?'' Ms. Talkington asked.
''It really shows me how much greed there is out there,'' she added. Card issuers ''aren't interested in helping me get back on track with a credit card,'' she said. ''They just want my money.''
Since the mass marketing of credit cards began decades ago, lenders have waited for years to extend credit to borrowers like Ms. Talkington who have fallen on hard times -- a process sometimes called ''rehabilitating the customer.'' But these days, rehab is happening faster because the lenders cannot afford to wait.
Citigroup is testing a credit card with training wheels, known as CitiMax, devised for customers whose credit was damaged by the recession. Borrowers are required to link their credit card account to a checking, savings or brokerage account so that Citi can withdraw money if a payment is missed.
Branch workers for Bank of America and Wells Fargo are steering more customers denied a traditional credit card toward ''secured'' cards, backed by a deposit that the owner is not permitted to touch.
Wells says that more than a third of secured cardholders receive a traditional credit card after 12 months.
''I graduated, as they call it, to the unsecured,'' said Joshua Hoglan, 26, a college student from Las Vegas who says he became a more responsible borrower after making timely payments on a Wells secured credit card he applied for in early 2008. He called graduation ''a great relief.''

HEADLINE: As China Rolls Ahead, Fear Follows

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI
For nearly two years, China's turbocharged economy has raced ahead with the aid of a huge government stimulus program and aggressive lending by state-run banks.
But a growing number of economists now worry that China -- the world's fastest growing economy and a pillar of strength during the global financial crisis -- could be stalled next year by soaring inflation, mounting government debt and asset bubbles.
Two credit ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch Ratings, say China is still poised for growth, yet they have also recently warned about hidden risks in its banking system. Fitch even hinted at the possibility of another wave of nonperforming loans tied to the property market.
In the late 1990s and early this decade, the Chinese government was forced to bail out and recapitalize these same state-run banks because a soaring number of bad loans had left them nearly insolvent. 
Those banks are much stronger now, after a series of record public stock offerings in recent years that have raised billions of dollars from global investors.
But last week, an analyst at the Royal Bank of Scotland advised clients to hedge against the risk that a flood of cash into China, coupled with soaring inflation, could result in a ''day of reckoning.''
A sharp slowdown in China, which is growing at an annual rate of about 10 percent, would be a serious blow to the global economy since China's voracious demand for natural resources is helping to prop up growth in Asia and South America, even as the United States and the European Union struggle.
And because China is a major holder of United States Treasury debt and a major destination for American investment in recent years, any slowdown would also hurt American companies.
Aware of the risks, Beijing has moved recently to tame its domestic growth and rein in soaring food and housing prices by raising interest rates, tightening regulations on property sales and restricting lending.
At the end of the Central Economic Work Conference, a high-level annual economic policy meeting that concluded on Sunday, Beijing promised to combat inflation and stabilize the economy. Those pledges came just days after the central bank ordered banks to set aside larger capital reserves in a bid to slow lending, the sixth time it has done so this year. And the government reported on Saturday that the consumer price index had climbed 5.1 percent in November, the sharpest rise in nearly three years.
Analysts say more tightening measures are expected in the coming months but that the challenges are mounting.
''There are so many moving pieces,'' said Qu Hongbin, the chief China economist for HSBC in Hong Kong. ''It wouldn't be honest to say things aren't complicated.''
Optimists say China has been adept at steering the right economic course over the last decade, ramping up growth when needed and tamping it down when things get too hot.
But this time, Beijing is not just struggling with inflation, it is also trying to restructure its economy away from dependence on exports and toward domestic consumption in the hopes of creating more balanced and sustainable growth, analysts say.
China is also facing mounting international pressure to let its currency, the renminbi, rise in value. Some trading partners insist China is keeping its currency artificially low to give Chinese exporters a competitive advantage.
Beijing contends that raising the value of its currency would hurt coastal factories that operate on thin profit margins, forcing them to lay off millions of workers.
The most immediate challenge appears to be inflation, which some analysts say may be even more serious than the new figures suggest. Housing prices have skyrocketed. And prices for milk, vegetables and other foods have soared this year.
''The money supply is too large,'' said Andy Xie, an economist based in Shanghai who formerly worked at Morgan Stanley. ''They increased the money supply to stimulate the economy. Now land prices have jumped 20 times in some places, 100 times in others. Inflation is broad-based. Go into a supermarket. Milk is more expensive in China than it is in the U.S.''
In Shanghai, where the average monthly wage is about $350, a gallon of milk now costs about $5.50.
Wages have also risen sharply this year in coastal provinces amid reports of labor shortages and worker demands for higher pay. Many analysts expect more wage increases next year.
That may be good for workers, analysts say, but it will also change the dynamics of the Chinese economy and its export sector while contributing to higher inflation.
Beijing is now under pressure to mop up excess liquidity after state banks went on a lending binge during the stimulus program that got under way in early 2009. Analysts say a large portion of that lending was diverted to speculate in the property market.
In addition to restricting lending at the big state banks, Beijing recently moved to close hundreds of underground banks and attempted to restrain local governments from borrowing to build huge infrastructure projects, some of which may be wasteful, according to analysts.
Some economists say the real solution is for Beijing to privatize more industries and let the market play a bigger role. After the financial crisis hit, the state assumed more control over the economy.
Now, state banks and big state-owned companies are reluctant to surrender control over industries where they have monopoly power, analysts say.
''Inflation is not the most serious problem,'' says Xu Xiaonian, a professor of economics at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. ''The most fundamental problem we have to resolve is structural. We need more opening up and reform policies. Look at the state monopolies in education, health care, telecom and entertainment. We need to break those up. We need to create more jobs and make the economy more innovative.''
Zhiwu Chen, a professor of finance at Yale, agrees.
''The state economy and the local governments will be where the future problems occur,'' Professor Chen said in an e-mail response to questions on Sunday. ''They will be the sources of real troubles for the banks and the financial system.''
Though no economist is forecasting the end to China's decades-long bull run, many have turned more cautious. And Fitch Ratings recently released a study it conducted with the forecasting consultancy Oxford Economics that examined the effect a slowdown in China would have on the rest of the world.
Fitch expects China's economy to grow at an annual rate of 8.6 percent next year, down from about 9.7 percent this year. But the report, which was released a few weeks ago, said that if growth slowed to 5 percent, the economies of many other Asian nations would suffer seriously. Steel, energy and manufacturing industries around the world would also be hard hit, it said.
Fitch analysts are careful not to forecast a sharp slowdown in China. But if one comes, they say, it is ''most likely to stem from a combination of property crash and banking crisis.''

HEADLINE: Preying on Veterans

 BODY:
The for-profit education industry has been pushing back hard against new Education Department rules that will make it easier to rein in predatory schools that strip students of financial aid, saddle them with crushing debt and give them nothing in return. But the evidence is mounting that the new rules might not be enough to prevent some of the worst abuses. 
The Times's Eric Lipton recently described how some unscrupulous for-profit schools are preying on service members and veterans.
In 2008 Congress approved enhanced tuition aid for veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars; active-duty personnel are eligible for free tuition. The program has set off a feeding frenzy among for-profit schools, which consumed 36 percent of the tuition aid paid out in the first year -- even though the sector educates only about 9 percent of the general student population.
That would be fine if veterans were getting the education they needed. But former and current recruiters in the for-profit sector told The Times that employers had pressured them to enroll as many service members as possible, even if they were likely to fail or drop out.
Earlier this year, Robert Songer, a retired Marine colonel who serves as the lead education adviser at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, warned Congress about this problem: schools hounded service members into enrolling, put them in classes of dubious value and had them take out high-interest loans to cover extra costs. The men and women were ''easy targets,'' he said, because many came from families in which no one had gone to college.
Americans who risk their lives for this country deserve better. Congress needs to ensure that predatory schools with weak offerings and high dropout rates are booted from the tuition program and that only legitimate schools remain.

HEADLINE: Ron Paul, G.O.P. Loner, Comes In From Cold

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As virtually all of Washington was declaring WikiLeaks's disclosures of secret diplomatic cables an act of treason, Representative Ron Paul was applauding the organization for exposing the United States' ''delusional foreign policy.''
For this, the conservative blog RedState dubbed him ''Al Qaeda's favorite member of Congress.''
It was hardly the first time that Mr. Paul had marched to his own beat. During his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, he was best remembered for declaring in a debate that the 9/11 attacks were the Muslim world's response to American military intervention around the globe. A fellow candidate, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, interrupted and demanded that he take back the words -- a request that Mr. Paul refused.
During his 20 years in Congress, Mr. Paul has staked out the lonely end of 434-to-1 votes against legislation that he considers unconstitutional, even on issues as ceremonial as granting Mother Teresa a Congressional Gold Medal. His colleagues have dubbed him ''Dr. No,'' but his wife will insist that they have the spelling wrong: he is really Dr. Know. 
Now it appears others are beginning to credit him with some wisdom -- or at least acknowledging his passionate following.
After years of blocking him from a leadership position, Mr. Paul's fellow Republicans have named him chairman of the House subcommittee on domestic monetary policy, which oversees the Federal Reserve as well as the currency and the valuation of the dollar.
Mr. Paul has strong views on those issues. He has written a book called ''End the Fed''; he embraces Austrian economic thought, which holds that the government has no role in regulating the economy; and he advocates a return to the gold standard.
Many of the new Republicans in the next Congress campaigned on precisely the issues that Mr. Paul has been talking about for 40 years: forbidding Congress from any action not explicitly authorized in the Constitution, eliminating entire federal departments as unconstitutional and checking the power of the Fed.
He has been called the ''intellectual godfather of the Tea Party,'' but he also is the real father of the Tea Party movement's most high-profile winner, Senator-elect Rand Paul of Kentucky. (The two will be roommates in Ron Paul's Virginia condominium. ''I told him as long as he didn't expect me to cook,'' the elder Mr. Paul said. ''I'm not going to take care of him the way his mother did.'')
Republicans had blocked Mr. Paul from leading the monetary policy panel once before, and banking executives reportedly urged them to do so again. But Republicans on Capitol Hill increasingly recognize that Mr. Paul has a following -- among his supporters from 2008 and within the Tea Party, which helped the Republicans recapture the House majority by picking up Mr. Paul's longstanding and highly vocal opposition to the federal debt.
Aides, supporters and television interviewers now use words like ''vindicated'' to describe him -- a term Mr. Paul, a 75-year-old obstetrician with the manner of a country doctor, brushes off.
''I don't think it's very personal,'' he said in an interview in his office on the Hill, where he has represented the 14th District of Texas on and off since 1976. ''People are really worried about what's happening, so they're searching, and I think they see that we've been offering answers.''
If there is vindication here, Mr. Paul says, it is for Austrian economic theory -- an anti-Keynesian model that many mainstream economists consider radical and dismiss as magical thinking.
The theory argues that markets operate properly only when they are unfettered by government regulation and intervention. It holds that the government should not have a central bank or dictate economic or monetary policy. Once the government begins any economic planning, such thinking goes, it ends up making all the economic decisions for its citizens, essentially enslaving them.
The walls of Mr. Paul's Congressional office are devoid of the usual pictures with presidents and other dignitaries. Instead, there are portraits of Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard, titans of the Austrian school. For years, Mr. Paul would talk about their ideas and eyes would glaze over. But during his presidential campaign, he said he began to notice a glimmer of recognition among those who attended his events, particularly on college campuses.
Mr. Paul now views his exchange with Mr. Giuliani in 2008 as a crucial moment in his drive for more supporters. ''A lot of them said, 'I'd never heard of you, and I liked what you said and I went and checked your voting record and you'd actually voted that way,' '' he said. ''They'd see that the thing that everybody on the House floor considered a liability for 20 years, my single 'no' votes, they'd say, 'He did that himself; he really must believe this.' ''
His campaign that year attracted a coalition that even he recognizes does not always stand together: young people who liked his advocacy of greater civil liberties and the decriminalization of marijuana; conservatives who nodded at his antidebt message; and others who agreed with his opposition to the Iraq war.
During George W. Bush's presidency, he was out of favor with the reigning neoconservatives who were alarmed at his anti-interventionism. He still gives many conservatives fits with comments like his praise for WikiLeaks.
And many of those who follow the Fed closely say his ideas are ''very strange indeed,'' in the words of Lyle E. Gramley, a former governor of the Fed who is now a senior economic adviser at the Potomac Research Group. ''I don't think he understands what central banking is all about,'' Mr. Gramley said.
Putting such a critic of the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in such a prominent role, he added, could damage economic confidence.
''The public doesn't understand how serious the problem was and why the Fed had to take the action it did,'' Mr. Gramley said. ''Having someone in Congress taking shots at the Fed makes the situation uneasy.''
Still, Mr. Paul says, his colleagues respect his following outside Washington. ''I was on the House floor today,'' he said, ''and somebody I don't know real well, another Republican, he was talking to two other members, and he knew I was listening. He pointed at me and said, 'That guy has more bumper stickers in my district than I do!' ''
Interview requests are so common that Mr. Paul has set up a camera and studio backdrop in his district office to save him the hour's drive to television stations in Houston.
His bill demanding a full audit of the Fed, which he had unsuccessfully pushed for years, attracted 320 co-sponsors in the House this year.
And the lunches that he has held in his office every Thursday, where lawmakers can meet intellectuals and policymakers who embrace Austrian economics, have become more crowded, drawing Tea Party celebrities like Congresswoman Michele Bachmann of Minnesota.
''For a long time, a lot of people in Congress on both sides of the aisle agreed with Ron a lot of the time but felt it wasn't safe to go there,'' said Jesse Benton, a longtime Ron Paul aide who ran Rand Paul's Senate campaign.
The father is about to gain even greater visibility. He says he will use his new chairmanship to renew his push for a full audit of the Fed and to hold a series of hearings on monetary policy.
On Web sites for Ron Paul fans, there are urgent pleas for a father-son (or son-father) ''Paul/Paul 2012'' ticket. But in an interview, the senior Mr. Paul seemed taken by surprise by the suggestion of teaming up. While he is bursting-proud of his son, he is not necessarily ready to yield the spotlight: He is pondering another presidential run on his own.
''I'd say it's at least 50-50 that I'll run again,'' he said, adding that he would look at where the economy is. (Aides add that it would depend a lot on what his wife, Carol, says.)
But for all the ways the Tea Party echoes Mr. Paul on fiscal issues, it is not clear such support would carry over into a presidential campaign. The last time he ran, he won less than 2 percent of the vote, though that was before the Tea Party became a force in politics.
Even many Tea Party conservatives are not on board with Mr. Paul's beliefs about scaling back the United States military worldwide. And Paul supporters look on the Tea Party with some disdain.
Mr. Paul acknowledged the sometimes competing interests among Tea Party supporters and his fans. ''What brings them together is this acceptance that there's something really wrong, that we've spent too much money and government's too big,'' he said.
That, he added, was why he had to work at keeping up his influence, particularly in spreading the word about the cost of foreign interventions.
Still, he noted: ''We're further along than I would have expected in getting our message out in front. I thought I'd be long gone from Congress before anybody would pay much attention.''

HEADLINE: Block Those Metaphors

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Like it or not -- and I don't -- the Obama-McConnell tax-cut deal, with its mixture of very bad stuff and sort-of-kind-of good stuff, is likely to pass Congress. Then what?
The deal will, without question, give the economy a short-term boost. The prevailing view, as far as I can tell -- and that includes within the Obama administration -- is that this short-term boost is all we need. The deal, we're told, will jump-start the economy; it will give a fragile recovery time to strengthen. 
I say, block those metaphors. America's economy isn't a stalled car, nor is it an invalid who will soon return to health if he gets a bit more rest. Our problems are longer-term than either metaphor implies.
And bad metaphors make for bad policy. The idea that the economic engine is going to catch or the patient rise from his sickbed any day now encourages policy makers to settle for sloppy, short-term measures when the economy really needs well-designed, sustained support.
The root of our current troubles lies in the debt American families ran up during the Bush-era housing bubble. Twenty years ago, the average American household's debt was 83 percent of its income; by a decade ago, that had crept up to 92 percent; but by late 2007, debts were 130 percent of income.
All this borrowing took place both because banks had abandoned any notion of sound lending and because everyone assumed that house prices would never fall. And then the bubble burst.
What we've been dealing with ever since is a painful process of ''deleveraging'': highly indebted Americans not only can't spend the way they used to, they're having to pay down the debts they ran up in the bubble years. This would be fine if someone else were taking up the slack. But what's actually happening is that some people are spending much less while nobody is spending more -- and this translates into a depressed economy and high unemployment.
What the government should be doing in this situation is spending more while the private sector is spending less, supporting employment while those debts are paid down. And this government spending needs to be sustained: we're not talking about a brief burst of aid; we're talking about spending that lasts long enough for households to get their debts back under control. The original Obama stimulus wasn't just too small; it was also much too short-lived, with much of the positive effect already gone.
It's true that we're making progress on deleveraging. Household debt is down to 118 percent of income, and a strong recovery would bring that number down further. But we're still at least several years from the point at which households will be in good enough shape that the economy no longer needs government support.
But wouldn't it be expensive to have the government support the economy for years to come? Yes, it would -- which is why the stimulus should be done well, getting as much bang for the buck as possible.
Which brings me back to the Obama-McConnell deal. I'm often asked how I can oppose that deal given my consistent position in favor of more stimulus. The answer is that yes, I believe that stimulus can have major benefits in our current situation -- but these benefits have to be weighed against the costs. And the tax-cut deal is likely to deliver relatively small benefits in return for very large costs.
The point is that while the deal will cost a lot -- adding more to federal debt than the original Obama stimulus -- it's likely to get very little bang for the buck. Tax cuts for the wealthy will barely be spent at all; even middle-class tax cuts won't add much to spending. And the business tax break will, I believe, do hardly anything to spur investment given the excess capacity businesses already have.
The actual stimulus in the plan comes from the other measures, mainly unemployment benefits and the payroll tax break. And these measures (a) won't make more than a modest dent in unemployment and (b) will fade out quickly, with the good stuff going away at the end of 2011.
The question, then, is whether a year of modestly better performance is worth $850 billion in additional debt, plus a significantly raised probability that those tax cuts for the rich will become permanent. And I say no.
The Obama team obviously disagrees. As I understand it, the administration believes that all it needs is a little more time and money, that any day now the economic engine will catch and we'll be on the road back to prosperity. I hope it's right, but I don't think it is.
What I expect, instead, is that we'll be having this same conversation all over again in 2012, with unemployment still high and the economy suffering as the good parts of the current deal go away. The White House may think it has struck a good bargain, but I believe it's in for a rude shock.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Tries Again For New York City Store

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
The New York City Council was supposed to hold a hearing this Tuesday about a renewed campaign by Wal-Mart to open its stores in the city.
But it had to be rescheduled, for January.
''We needed a bigger room,'' the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said. ''We heard from unions all across the city, small business leaders from across the city. It's a growing list of people.''
Wal-Mart, an inescapable part of the retail landscape just about everywhere except in New York City, twice retreated on efforts to open stores in the city after fierce community opposition.
Now it is back, and mounting an aggressive campaign to crack the country's largest urban market. Wal-Mart is looking at properties in each of the five boroughs and has hired Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's former campaign manager, Bradley Tusk, to help coordinate its lobbying efforts. 
Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate, predicted, ''They're not going to find it easy to get serious public support.''
''As you reap,'' Mr. de Blasio added, ''so shall you sow, and they've had a really bad history. You can talk to people across the spectrum and they've all heard something about the problems of Wal-Mart.''
The renewed push by Wal-Mart comes five years after the retailer tried to open stores in Queens and Staten Island but faced furious opposition from community leaders and elected officials. But the retailer and its supporters, and even its opponents, say that the dynamics have changed and that the city has become more receptive to so-called big-box stores, like Target and Ikea.
But perhaps the greatest difference is the economy. With the city's unemployment rate hovering around 9 percent, any project that promises jobs might find appeal.
''This is a time when the economy is bad and a lot of my constituents are looking for jobs,'' said Darryl C. Towns, a state assemblyman whose Brooklyn district includes East New York, one area Wal-Mart is considering. ''We have to begin to think out of the box and look at some different opportunities.''
Wal-Mart is the country's largest private employer, with 1.4 million workers, but it has been a constant target for labor groups who say its wages are too low and its benefits insufficient. The United States Supreme Court recently agreed to hear the nation's biggest employment discrimination suit, which claims that Wal-Mart has discriminated against female employees in pay and promotion.
''There are some people who say, 'Well, if Wal-Mart comes in, that means jobs,' '' said Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which supported the efforts to stop Wal-Mart the last time it tried to open stores in New York. ''But what it does is, it replaces good jobs with jobs that keep people in poverty.''
Other big-box stores that have gained a foothold in New York, like Costco, provide far better compensation than Wal-Mart, some labor leaders said.
And critics say Wal-Mart would also spell doom for nearby small businesses that could never compete with the giant retailer on price and selection. But some Wal-Mart supporters say protecting businesses that charge higher prices is unfair to consumers, especially when so many New Yorkers are worried about their finances.
''Competition means people have to step up and compete or it's not going to work out,'' said Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York. ''I don't think government should say that we're going to make sure people have to pay more or travel farther because we want to protect certain types of establishments.''
This time, Wal-Mart is using different tactics to make stores more palatable to neighbors.
Steven Restivo, a spokesman for Wal-Mart, said the retailer was looking at sites of all sizes, including land parcels that would accommodate stores that -- by its standards -- are quite small, under 30,000 square feet. Many Wal-Marts are five times that size. The company is working with a commercial real estate broker to talk to property owners.
''There is a business case to be made for our growth in large cities across the country,'' Mr. Restivo said. ''We know we have customers there, and we know we want to make access to our brand more convenient.''
Wal-Mart might also look to build stores in New York that are small enough to require only a willing landlord and a lease, bypassing the City Council, which must give special zoning approval to projects over 10,000 square feet in some manufacturing districts. About a year ago, the Council defeated a plan, which had been supported by the mayor, to redevelop the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx into a major commercial complex.
This year, Wal-Mart has also expanded its pitch, promoting itself as a solution to problems beyond unemployment. Mr. Restivo said that in its hunt for real estate, the company was focusing on areas that were ''underserved'' both economically and in their access to fresh food. Providing more fruits and vegetables to these so-called food deserts is a crucial issue for both Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Quinn, the council speaker.
And in an effort that is likely to anger other labor groups, Wal-Mart is working to win the support of one powerful union group, the Building and Construction Trades Council, and is negotiating a deal that would guarantee that stores would be built and renovated by union workers.
But there is still enormous opposition, from unions, community groups and elected leaders, to the idea of a Wal-Mart rising in any city neighborhood.
One union official, Pat Purcell, an aide to the president of the UFCW Local 1500, which represents supermarket workers, said, ''This is not a battle, this is a war.''
Mr. Bloomberg, who invested major political capital in trying to win support for the Kingsbridge Armory proposal, told reporters recently that he ''would love to see Wal-Mart open here,'' noting that many New Yorkers travel to Nassau County or New Jersey to shop at Wal-Mart.
''You're not going to stop, and nor should you stop, people from having the opportunity to shop where they want to shop,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''The city should not be in the business of picking and choosing who is there.''
Correction: December 15, 2010, Wednesday
An article on Monday about Wal-Mart's latest efforts to open a store in New York City described incorrectly a deal being discussed between Wal-Mart and the Building and Construction Trades Council. Under the deal, union workers would be used for construction and renovation of all Wal-Mart stores in New York City, not just some of them. The article also described the City Council's zoning powers imprecisely. While it must approve retail stores over 10,000 square feet, that is the case only in some manufacturing districts, not anywhere in the city.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Seeking to Shed Reputation for Homelessness

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- It was just past dusk in the upscale enclave of Brentwood as a homeless man, wrapped in a tattered gray blanket, stepped into a doorway to escape a light rain, watching the flow of people on their way to the high-end restaurants that lined the street.
Across town in Hollywood the next morning, homeless people were wandering up and down Sunset Boulevard, pushing shopping carts and slumped at bus stops. More homeless men and women could be found shuffling along the boardwalks of Venice and Santa Monica, while a few others were spotted near the heart of Beverly Hills, the very symbol of Los Angeles wealth.
And, as always, San Julian Street, the infamous center of Skid Row on the south edge of downtown Los Angeles, was teeming: a small city of people were making the street their home in a warm December sun, waiting for one of the many missions there to serve a meal. 
At a time when cities across the country have made significant progress over the past decade in reducing the number of homeless, in no small part by building permanent housing, the problem seems intractable in the County of Los Angeles.
It has become a subject of acute embarrassment to some civic leaders, upset over the county's faltering efforts, the glaring contrast of street poverty and mansion wealth, and any perception of a hardhearted Los Angeles unmoved by a problem that has motivated action in so many other cities.
For national organizations trying to eradicate homelessness, Los Angeles -- with its 48,000 people living on the streets, including 6,000 veterans, according to one count -- stands as a stubborn anomaly, an outlier at a time when there has been progress, albeit modest and at times fitful, in so many cities.
Its designation as the homeless capital of America, a title that people here dislike but do not contest, seems increasingly indisputable.
''If we want to end homelessness in this country, we have to do something about L.A.; it is the biggest nut,'' said Nan Roman, the president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. ''It has more homeless people than anyplace else.''
Neil J. Donovan, the executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, said he believed that, after years of decline, there had been a slight rise in the number of homeless nationally this year because of the economic downturn, and that Los Angeles had led the way.
''Los Angeles's homeless problem is growing faster than the overall national problem,'' he said, ''trending upwards in every demographic, dashing every hope of progress anywhere.''
In a reflection of the growing concern here, a task force created by the Chamber of Commerce and the United Way of Greater Los Angeles has stepped in with a plan, called Home for Good, to end homelessness here in five years. The idea is to, among other things, build housing for 12,000 of the chronically unemployed and provide food, maintenance and other services at a cost of $235 million a year.
The proposal, based on the task force's study of what other cities had done, was embraced by political and civic leaders even as it served as a reminder of how many of these plans have failed over the years.
''This is not rocket science,'' said Zev Yaroslavsky of the County Board of Supervisors. ''It's been done in New York, it's been done in Atlanta, and it's been done in San Francisco.''
Part of the impetus for this most recent flurry of attention is concern in the business and political communities that the epidemic is threatening to tarnish Los Angeles's national image and undercut a campaign to promote tourism, particularly in downtown, which has been in the midst of a transformation of sorts, with a boom of museums, concert halls, restaurants, boutiques, parks and lofts.
The gentrification has pushed many of the homeless people south, but they can still be seen settled on benches and patches of grass in the center of downtown.
''If you have a homeless problem, then your sense of security is diminished, and that makes people not want to come,'' said Jerry Neuman, a co-chairman of the task force. ''It's a problem that diminishes us in many ways: the way we view ourselves and the way other people view us.''
Fittingly enough, it was even the subject of a movie last year, ''The Soloist,'' which portrayed the relationship between a Los Angeles Times columnist, Steve Lopez, who has written extensively about the homeless, and a musician living on the streets.
The obstacles seem particularly great in this part of the country. The warm climate has always been a draw for homeless people. And the fact that people sleeping outside rarely die of exposure means there is less pressure on civic leaders to act. (In New York City, when a homeless woman known only as ''Mama'' was found dead at Grand Central Terminal on a frigid Christmas in 1985, it was front-page news that inspired a campaign to deal with the epidemic.)
The governmental structure here, of a county that includes 88 cities and a maze of conflicting jurisdictions, responsibilities and boundaries, has defused responsibility and made it nearly impossible for any one organization or person to take charge.
And Los Angeles is a place where people drive almost everywhere, so there are fewer of the reminders of homelessness -- walking around a sleeping person on a sidewalk, responding to requests for money at the corner -- that are common in concentrated cities like New York.
''It's easy to get up in the morning, go to work, drive home and never encounter someone who is homeless,'' said Wendy Greuel, the Los Angeles city controller. ''I don't think it's seeped into the public's consciousness that homelessness is a problem.''
The homelessness task force offered its plan at a conference that attracted some of the top elected officials here, including Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa and three of the five members of the Board of Supervisors, a notable show of political support.
''We believe that with the release of this plan, we now have a blueprint to end chronic homelessness and veteran homelessness,'' said Christine Marge, director of housing for the United Way of Greater Los Angeles.
Yet in a time of severe budget retrenchment, the five-year goal seems daunting. Even though the drafters of the plan say that no new money will be needed to finance it -- Los Angeles is already spending more than $235 million a year on hospital, overnight housing and police costs dealing with the homeless -- government financing of all social services has come under assault.
''I don't for a minute think it's not going to require a tremendous amount of political will to make it happen,'' said Richard Bloom, the mayor of Santa Monica. ''Do I think it can happen? Yes, because I've seen what happens in other cities, like New York City, Denver and Boston.''
Still, Mr. Bloom, who said he regularly attended conferences involving officials from other communities, added: ''Our numbers are way out of whack with those numbers I hear elsewhere. It's just so much more enormous and daunting here.''

HEADLINE: The Topic Is Big-City Attractions, but the Star Is Buick

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
IN an episode of ''Re: Discover,'' a new Web-only travel series on MSN that promises to give an insider perspective on American cities, John Papsidera, a casting director and restaurateur who lives in Los Angeles, is chatting in a lounge with three other Angelenos when he hesitates before recommending a bar.
''I'm not sure I even want to give up secrets, but how about the Cozy Inn?'' Mr. Papsidera says, as the other participants -- an artist, food stylist and fashion designer -- trade puzzled expressions. ''The Cozy Inn is in Culver City, and it's a fantastic old-school bar. It has a shuffleboard table, a great jukebox -- it's a fantastic hidden gem.'' 
While it resembles conventional travel shows, the series turns out to be a vehicle for, appropriately enough, a vehicle. ''Re: Discover'' is underwritten by Buick, a division of General Motors, and the MSN microsite (rediscover.msn.com/) makes clear that it is ''presented by Buick,'' as does an opening credit for each video.
Produced by FremantleMedia, which also produces television shows including ''American Idol'' and ''America's Got Talent,'' episodes from the new series about Chicago, Miami and New York were uploaded on Dec. 7. During the next six months, an additional eight cities will be featured, with all 12 destinations being the subject of five episodes that are about four minutes long.
The series features what it calls insiders, often designers, chefs, musicians, journalists and community organizers. Some New York episodes, for example, feature Karen Washington, a community activist who has been instrumental in the urban farming effort to turn empty lots into community gardens.
Buick models, particularly the Regal, appear only incidentally in the videos, as in product placement deals in television shows or movies. Specifically, participants drive from one establishment or attraction to another in Buicks, but never mention the brand.
''The vehicles are woven into the content, but not in such a way where you say, 'All I see is Buick,'' said John Casmon, advertising manager at Buick. ''Fremantle did a phenomenal job of ensuring the cars were in the storytelling.''
Like other branded entertainment projects, rather than highlighting, say, ample legroom, the series is aiming for something more subtle: instilling in viewers an affinity for Buick.
''Buick is enabling the entire experience, and you don't need to force Buicks into the videos,'' said Russ Axelrod, senior brand strategist for the branded entertainment group within Microsoft Advertising. ''If I'm a consumer coming to the site, the underlying message is that Buick gets me, that they understand what I like on a content basis, and if they understand what I like on a content basis maybe they'll understand me on a vehicle basis.''
While the sales pitch is not explicit in the travel videos, it is elsewhere on the microsite, which features television ads for Buick, by the Detroit office of Leo Burnett, part of the Publicis Groupe.
''It's time to take a different look at luxury,'' says a voiceover in one ad. ''It's not luxury the way it was. It's luxury the way it should be.''
It is no coincidence that the brand is, through the series, encouraging a fresh look at cities at the same time its ads encourage a fresh look at its cars.
''Buick is sort of trying to reinvent itself in the eyes of the consumer,'' said Mr. Axelrod. ''All the cities profiled have been around for more than 100 years, just like Buick has been around a long time, too. Cities are reinvigorating themselves and being discovered in a new way, whether it's Miami or L.A. or New York, and that's what Buick is trying to get across as well.''
MSN, among the most popular sites on the Internet, drew 124.7 million unique users in October, according to comScore.
Buick, which declined to say how much it is spending on ''Re: Discover,'' spent $179.5 million on advertising in 2009, compared with $99.2 million in 2008, an increase of 81 percent, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP. Over that time Buick increased spending on Internet advertising even more strikingly, to $16.4 million from $6.6 million, an increase of 148 percent.
While General Motors is encouraging domestic travel in the series, the economic downturn has been no vacation for the automaker, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 and borrowed $49.5 billion from the federal government. G.M. discontinued three brands -- Pontiac, Saturn and Hummer -- and sold a fourth, Saab, to a Dutch company.
This year, though, has been better, with G.M. out of bankruptcy and earning $2 billion for the third quarter, its largest quarterly profit in 11 years. Buick has been the company's fastest growing brand, with year-to-date sales through November of 11,725 vehicles, which represents a 54 percent increase over the first 11 months of 2009, according to the company.
One city absent from the 12 featured in the travel series is the one where Buick has its headquarters: Detroit.
''We talked about Detroit, and we love Detroit, but it's not in the original batch of cities because we do quite well there as it is,'' said Mr. Casmon of Buick. ''Los Angeles, Miami, New York -- in some of those markets we don't have as strong a position, and we're hoping to reintroduce the Buick brand to that audience, especially those who drive imports who are not familiar with Buick right now.''

HEADLINE: Struggling in the Downturn, A.&P. Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
10:03 p.m. Updated The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, the troubled supermarket operator, filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday to reorganize its finances after suffering under its big debt load and from stiff competition.
A.&P., whose stores include Pathmark and the Food Emporium in addition to its eponymous chain, is among the biggest Chapter 11 cases of the year, amid a relative dearth of major bankruptcy filings.
In documents filed in bankruptcy court in the Southern District of New York, A.&P. listed $2.5 billion in assets and $3.2 billion in debt as of Sept. 11. 
A.&P. has run losses for several consecutive quarters, including a $153.7 million loss for the three months ended Sept. 11.
Among the company's more pressing problems, according to another court filing: It faced $13.4 million in interest payments due on Wednesday, and it had been unable to reach an agreement with C&S Wholesale Grocers, which supplies about 70 percent of A.&P.'s inventory.
''We have taken this difficult but necessary step to enable A&P to fully implement our comprehensive financial and operational restructuring,'' Sam Martin, the company's chief executive, said in a statement.
Sunday's filing marks a low point for A.&P., once the nation's dominant supermarket company. Founded in 1859 in New York City as a tea seller, A.&P. spread rapidly through the nation, operating as many as 16,000 stores.
But beginning in the 1970s, it began running into tougher competition, from regional chains to big-box retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and Costco, forcing a retrenchment. As of this year, it operated 395 stores along the East Coast. The company also suffered from the recession, which helped spur consumers to seek lower-priced groceries elsewhere.
The company, based in Montvale, N.J., has struggled in recent years, notably after buying Pathmark in 2007 for $679 million, a deal that left A.&P. with significant debt.
Other supermarket chains, including Bi-Lo, have filed for bankruptcy in recent years.
A.&P.'s filing came as little surprise, as the company's prolonged financial difficulties prompted speculation about a potential bankruptcy filing. Shares in the company plunged 67 percent on Friday, to 93 cents, before trading in the stock was halted.
The company has secured an $800 million debtor-in-possession loan from JPMorgan Chase to keep operating under bankruptcy. It also named Frederic F. Brace, who helped run United Airlines' bankruptcy filing, as its chief restructuring officer.
Among A.&P.'s biggest shareholders is Aletheia Research & Management, a money manager based in California that owns 27 percent of the company's stock (and has recently come under regulatory scrutiny over its bookkeeping practices).
Aletheia gained notoriety for its tendency to invest alongside the supermarket mogul Ronald W. Burkle -- who as Pathmark's largest shareholder helped engineer its sale to A.&P.
Barnes & Noble, in its effort to defend itself against a proxy challenge by Mr. Burkle, accused the billionaire of secretly teaming up with Aletheia to take control of the bookseller without paying a premium. Mr. Burkle and Aletheia denied the charge.
Mr. Burkle's investment vehicle, the Yucaipa Companies, owns a 4 percent stake in A.&P.'s common stock, according to a bankruptcy court filing. Yucaipa also owns a significant amount of preferred shares, having invested in A.&P. last year.
A.&P.'s major shareholders supported the company's decision to file for bankruptcy, the retailer said in its statement.
The company's largest unsecured creditor is Wilmington Trust, which is representing several classes of investors owning nearly $677 million in bonds.
Unlike many other big debtors in recent years, A.&P. did not announce what is known as a ''pre-arranged'' or ''prepackaged'' bankruptcy filing, in which a company reaches some agreement with its creditors over a reorganization plan. Such filings tend to be shorter in duration, sparing companies time and potential legal headaches.
A.&P. is being advised by Lazard and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. A.&P.'s Bankruptcy Filing A.&P. Affidavit in Support of Its Bankruptcy Filing

HEADLINE: Laying Out Economic Cities, Saudis See Window to Modernity

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
JIDDA, Saudi Arabia -- Just off a desert road about an hour's drive from this port city, an enormous arched gate capped by three domes rises out of the sand like the set for a 1920s silent film fantasy. It is, instead, a fantasy of contemporary urban planning, the site of what one day will be King Abdullah Economic City, a 65-square-mile development at the edge of the Red Sea. With a projected population of two million, the city is a Middle Eastern version of the ''special economic zones'' that have flourished in places like China.
The city is one of four being laid out on empty desert around this country, all scheduled for completion by 2030. They follow on the heels of the country's first coeducational university, which opened last year next to the King Abdullah site, and a financial district nearly the size of Lower Manhattan that is rising on the outskirts of the capital, Riyadh. 
Architecturally they couldn't be more dreary and conventional -- bloated glass towers encircled by quaint town houses and suburban villas decorated in ersatz historical styles. Their gargantuan scale and tabula rasa approach conjure old-style Modernist planning efforts like the creation of Brasilia in the 1950s or the colossal Soviet urban experiments of the 1930s, but these are driven by anxiety over the future, not utopian idealism.
With more than 13 million Saudis -- half the population -- under 20, the 86-year-old Saudi ruler, King Abdullah, is trying to create more than a million new jobs and 4 million homes within 10 to 15 years. He and his royal clan envision an economy less dependent on oil, run by a new class of doctors, engineers and businessmen who can function in a global marketplace.
To accomplish this feat the Saudi government says it needs to crack the door open to some sort of Western-style modernity -- or at least a softer version of the Islam practiced here, with its strictly enforced separation of the sexes, its severe restrictions on the public lives of women and the ever watchful eye of the religious police.
The idea is to create islands from which change would seep out, drop by drop, without antagonizing powerful conservative forces within the country.
If the plan works, at best it would transform Saudi Arabia into a technologically advanced society controlled by a slightly more tolerant religious autocracy. Or it could provoke militant violence and government crackdowns.
''What they are trying to do is very difficult,'' said Bernard Haykel, a professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University who has written extensively on Saudi Arabia. ''Someone telling you to go pray -- that in-your-face religion -- that's not going to be permitted in these cities. It's a more ecumenical Islam. But it's a slippery slope. Once you start, you've basically opened up the door to a certain degree of diversity and tolerance.''
Urban Fortresses
In many ways Saudi Arabia looks like a modern country. Riyadh was laid out on a rationalist urban grid in the 1960s by Constantinos Doxiadis, a postwar Modernist planner. King Fahd Road, its main axis, is a multilane highway that cuts the city in two and is dotted with recognizable landmarks: Kingdom Center, a skyscraper known as ''the bottle opener'' because of a triangular hole at the top, designed by the American firm Ellerbe Becket; Norman Foster's pointy Al Faisaliah tower; and the headquarters of the Interior Ministry, a menacing upside-down concrete pyramid that looms just off the main strip.
Underneath the modern gloss, however, the city's architecture reflects the strictures of the Saudis' severe Wahhabi brand of Islam. Public parks -- where men and women might mingle -- are few; restaurants have separate dining areas for men and women; banks have separate entrances; and cinemas are banned. Many windows are covered by modern versions of mashrabiyas, traditional latticework screens, to ensure privacy. Men and women avoid riding elevators together. The most open public spaces are hotel lobbies, where women sometimes show their faces.
When I visited recently, the steel frames of the financial district's first towers could be seen rising at the city's northern edge, just beyond a ring road. According to the government, this will one day be the financial center of the entire Middle East, and the design blends elements of Wall Street, La Defense in Paris, and Canary Wharf in London into a kind of generic financial theme park.
At the heart of the plan is Financial Plaza, a sterile limestone square framed by a stock exchange and several bank towers. (One of the tallest is named the World Trade Center.) These will be surrounded by more corporate towers, nearly 50 in all, that will stand at irregular angles to one another and rise out of a two-story retail base linked by skywalks. A monorail will loop through the site, with stops at a planned children's museum, a science exhibition center and the country's first aquarium.
The public spaces are closer in spirit to Las Vegas than to Riyadh. An elaborate pedestrian promenade will zigzag through the site, flanked by a narrow reflecting pool intended to conjure a traditional wadi, the mostly dry riverbed that runs through desert valleys. Branches of the ''wadi'' will connect to small public squares that the architects envision as social meeting places.
Even more striking is that the design guidelines say nothing about the separation of the sexes. Jacob Kurek, a partner at Henning Larsen, architects of the master plan, showed me apartment layouts no different from those in a standard residential high rise in New York or London. Many have floor-to-ceiling windows, allowing people to stare directly into them.
Meanwhile the seven mosques that were part of the original master plan have been reduced by more than half, and most of the daily worship will take place in public prayer rooms tucked into buildings.
''None of the religious issues came into the design in any way,'' Mr. Kurek said. ''They want to attract a bit of both Westerners and young Saudis who have traveled abroad, in order to integrate them.''
But this integration stops at the district's edge. Highways surround the site, isolating it within rivers of traffic. Many of the meandering streets created by the wadi dead-end in cul-de-sacs, adding to the feeling of disconnection from the street grid of Riyadh. Most people will enter by car, parking on one of four underground levels and riding elevators to street level. Once inside they will walk among buildings through more than two miles of air-conditioned skywalks, a vision that seems to have been airlifted from cold-war-era Houston.
In part the district's isolation stems from the Saudis' security concerns. The master plan lays out the advantages of an ''island site'' that would allow authorities to restrict comings and goings as well as to shut down the entire district if there is a security alert. (A similar plan is being designed for ground zero in Manhattan.)
As important, however, is that the isolation of the site will keep its vision of modernity from close contact with Riyadh's strictly monitored society, at least too soon. When it is completed, sometime in 2012, the Financial District will be its own world. Over the next decade, as the city grows around it, and the country continues to modernize, the two would become more closely integrated. Eventually, they expect, it will be linked to central Riyadh by a tram system.
A Test for Integration
King Abdullah Economic City -- KAEC (pronounced ''cake''), as the Saudi government calls it -- is envisioned as another island of relative liberalism within Saudi Arabia. For now, just beyond the gate, a roadway flanked by shrubs, palm trees and the occasional billboard of King Abdullah extends through miles of empty desert. At its far end the first stages of development rise: some tinted glass corporate office buildings, a long row of town houses and a pedestrian boardwalk overlooking the turquoise waters of the Red Sea.
According to the agency in charge of developing the economic cities, this cluster of buildings will blossom into a walled city with 400,000 apartments, town houses and villas; a central business district; an industrial zone; a 250-acre university campus; and one of the world's largest and most technologically advanced ports.
''The whole objective is job creation,'' said Amr al-Dabbagh, the agency's governor. ''The biggest oil refinery produces at most 1,500 jobs. We will produce a million.''
Despite the occasional Islamic-style embellishments -- a villa with an arched entryway, a trellised porch -- the developments bring to mind the camps built here by Aramco, the American oil conglomerate, for its executives and workers in the 1950s and '60s. Like this new city those camps were sealed enclaves, re-creations of American-style subdivisions complete with front lawns, backyard barbecues and baseball diamonds. And they followed what were known as ''Aramco rules'': women were allowed to walk around unveiled, drive cars and mingle with men.
But KAEC is Aramco with a twist. Conceived on a larger scale, economically and socially more diverse, it aims to draw a range of Western corporations and their employees, as well as their expertise, to create a social mixing chamber. The core of the city will be a business district much like the one on the outskirts of Riyadh. Residential areas will be interlaced with the kind of open public spaces -- parks, plazas and the waterfront promenades -- that are generic in large Western-style developments but almost impossible to find in Saudi Arabia.
Artists' renderings of the project show couples happily strolling around the city dressed in an ambiguous mix of Islamic and Western styles. A video of the future university has women, their heads covered but otherwise in Western-looking dress, mingling with men on campus. To encourage more foreign companies and their employees to come here, the government will allow foreign ownership for the first time. And officials say the city will have a streamlined bureaucracy, so that unlike in other Saudi cities, where delays can make even the simplest transactions stretch out for days, action on visas or customs documents will take just an hour.
Ahmed Osilan, Mr. Dabbagh's chief of staff, explained the difference between King Abdullah Economic City and the old Aramco camps this way: It is ''not an Aramco town -- it will have a mix of foreigners and nationals -- but Aramco rules.'' He added, ''The coeducation, the mixing -- they're tools for bringing about various changes the king wants.''
Eventually KAEC is supposed to be joined by three other cities: Knowledge Economic City on the outskirts of Medina, the burial place of Muhammad and one of the Arab world's holiest cities; Prince Abdulaziz bin Mousaed Economic City, 450 miles north of Riyadh, which will focus on agribusiness; and Jazan Economic City, intended to provide industrial jobs to Saudis living near the border of Yemen, a stronghold of Al Qaeda that has become one of the most volatile areas in the Middle East.
''The economic cities are unique,'' Mr. Osilan said, explaining the government's thinking. ''They are contained developments. Should they succeed they will be contagious to the neighboring region. Should they fail it is still contained.''
A Fine Line
But that kind of containment may be difficult in the age of Facebook and Twitter. Only a year ago the king attended the opening of Saudi Arabia's first coeducational graduate school, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, a 10-minute drive from the King Abdullah site. From the desert outside, the campus looks like a military encampment: 800 acres surrounded by a ring road and a concrete and steel wall.
Inside, I was told, the development is organized around a town square that links the university buildings to a residential area for up to 25,000 people. There are no strict religious dress codes -- women can walk around in shorts if they choose -- and anyone can drive. Aramco rules.
Yet soon after the campus opened, a two-minute video showing men and women dancing in the school's cafeteria made its way to YouTube, outraging religious hard-liners. When a member of the Saudi Council of Senior Scholars, Sheik Saad al-Shathry, openly criticized the university, calling it evil, the king promptly fired him. Security was beefed up, and people involved in the project were forbidden to speak to the news media about ''social issues'' regarding the university -- meaning women. Trying to visit, I drove through an obstacle course of security bollards before being turned away at the front gate.
The clampdown underscores the delicate game the government is playing. ''There has been resistance since the 1960s to any innovations that are deemed too Western -- to television, to girls' education,'' said F. Gregory Gause III, a specialist in Middle Eastern politics at the University of Vermont. ''But that hasn't stopped them from happening. Even the most conservative sheik drives an S.U.V. and has a nice house. He's not living in the desert in a tent.'' At the same time, he went on to say, a thirst for the material luxuries that the modern world can provide can't be equated with demands for political rights -- something that he doesn't see happening here soon.
''Even lots of women are afraid of change,'' said Eman al-Najaf, a 31-year-old Saudi who blogs about women's issues here. ''Women who have been educated have been educated to stay the same. They've been brainwashed and prefer to live in their comfort zone.''
Several people here expressed outrage that the government was pouring billions of dollars into the creation of entire new cities while large areas of existing ones had deteriorated into slums. Jidda, for example, already has a port in desperate need of upgrading. Its historic center is a medieval slum inhabited by foreign laborers. The city has no sewer system, only septic tanks that regularly spill into the streets. And people who live there will have to continue living by the old rules.
''Here you have a long historical pattern of settlement,'' said a local architect, Tariq Alireza, expressing a frustration I encountered again and again here. ''There is an inordinate amount of vacant land. Why not solve our problems? Why not fix the port in Jidda? We're not Saudi Arabia? What law will apply here?''
If the government's vision fails -- if it cannot manage the forces of liberalism within its planned developments -- it could set off more intense clashes with militant forces that could ripple across the Middle East and the West. A more likely outcome is that, as resistance from the country's conservative religious establishment grows, the government will ratchet up its mechanisms of oppression.
But an even bigger danger, some say, may be that the government won't move forward at all.
''You're looking at decades,'' Mr. Haykel said. ''If these cities don't work, and they can't produce jobs and, say, the price of oil drops, you could have masses of people mobilizing against the government, and it could take the form of religious extremism. But in the long run if they don't produce an economy that's not dependent on oil, the country itself becomes unviable. I don't know how they would be able to sustain life there. It's an end-of-the-world scenario.''

HEADLINE: How Can a Tongue-Tied America Be a Global Leader?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Budget-Cutting Colleges Bid Some Languages Adieu'' (news article, Dec. 5):
Thinking in another language allows one to see the world through another's eyes -- a lesson most Americans would do well to learn. 
If universities cut the number of languages offered, they will enforce the idea that Americans are insular and self-serving. We must see America as others see us. Then we will understand our place in the global community.
Mary-Kay McHugh River Edge, N.J., Dec. 5, 2010
The writer teaches French in the Park Ridge School District.
To the Editor:
So at the same time that the Obama administration is providing additional financing to community colleges nationwide, in an effort to increase the number of college graduates, many universities are cutting back their foreign language programs.
The movement to cut languages and financing at universities (especially public institutions) is nothing less than a national disgrace.
The United States, the world's center of higher education, is on the verge of losing its status as a leader in education.
Perhaps the country needs to look into the bleeding of funds in the endless wars abroad and start reinvesting in endeavors that ennoble its citizens, particularly those who seek to change themselves and the world through higher education.
The vast wealth acquired by an infinitesimally small segment of the population over the last 30 years needs to be made available through an equitable tax base in order to properly and completely finance the institutions that helped to make the system of higher education in the United States the envy of the rest of the world.
Howard Lisnoff Great Barrington, Mass., Dec. 5, 2010
To the Editor:
How short-sighted can you get?
French is spoken or is the official language in dozens of countries. Russian is important in a dozen. Portuguese is important because of Brazil and other former colonies where it is still the language of education and politics.
German and Japanese (like French and Russian) are also important because of economics, literature and the large volume of current scientific research in those languages. Latin and Greek are important because of their connection to ancient literature and thought, their use as lingua francas in certain fields, and their being the roots of many Indo-European tongues.
Arabic and Mandarin are now appropriately recognized for their geopolitical significance, but that does not reduce the significance of any of the above mentioned languages.

HEADLINE: Advertisers Embrace a Market Stuck in the Back of a Cab

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Take a taxi through the East Village this week, and there is a good chance that a commercial for the Blue Man Group -- playing nearby on Astor Place -- will pop up on the miniature television facing the back seat.
It would not be a coincidence: the theater troupe is one of the advertisers using the GPS devices in cabs to pinpoint when and where its commercials should play. 
Once dismissed as a moving billboard dominated by advertising for strip clubs and beer, the yellow cab (and its backseat screen) is emerging as an unlikely vehicle for marketing techniques more common to the Internet than to a beat-up Crown Victoria.
The number of advertisers -- including national brands like AOL, Citibank and Sprint -- has doubled since last year, with cabs featuring everything from commercials for Broadway shows to a political advocacy campaign by Human Rights Watch.
The advantages for marketers are clear: captive viewers, affluent consumers and 13,000 locations across New York City -- although it may be hard to find one outside Manhattan.
Still, many passengers profess to hate the screens, deeming them squawking irritants. But the impulse to hit the off button may be a myth: the televisions stay on 85 percent of the time that cabs have passengers inside, according to data that the screens' operators have provided to the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
Such statistics have helped persuade skeptical businesses to embrace a medium that got its start in 2007, when New York became the first major city to require that cabs have televisions.
''When they first approached me, I said, 'You have got to be kidding me,' '' said Joe Barron, the owner of Definitions, a high-end Manhattan fitness chain that has advertised in taxis since last winter. Mr. Barron assumed that passengers would simply shut off the screens or ignore them, until he ran a test campaign and found his phone ringing with clients.
He has renewed his account six times since then, he said, and he is prepared to spend half a million dollars next year on taxi commercials, at the expense of advertising on the Internet or in magazines.
''Even if they are not watching the entire ad, they see our name up there,'' Mr. Barron said. ''They see our brand. They know we're out there.''
Agencies are looking to expand taxi advertising into markets like Boston, Chicago and Miami.
In New York, taxi passengers are shown a mix of news, weather and light cultural fare on a single channel provided by either WABC or WNBC. Next year, the city plans to add a second channel of government-produced programming, including shows like ''$9.99'' and ''NYC4Free,'' which point viewers to inexpensive goings-on in the city.
The second channel is intended to provide passengers with a greater range of entertainment options, city officials said. ''With two channels, there's a better chance for content you're happy with,'' said David S. Yassky, the taxi and limousine commissioner.
But the new channel will not add to the city's coffers: New York receives none of the advertising revenue from taxicabs. The profits are split between the sales agency and the channels that provide programming. In some cases, cab owners receive a cut, although drivers almost invariably do not.
It remains difficult to track sales of taxi-screen advertising. The agencies that oversee the sales would not release specific revenue figures, and industry observers like the Nielsen Company do not keep detailed statistics on the emerging field.
But VeriFone Media Solutions, which handles advertising sales for about 12,000 yellow cabs -- nearly the entire fleet -- said its revenue was up 60 percent in the past year. In November, the company had 105 active campaigns, compared with 67 a year ago. About two-thirds of its sales are from national brands, with a heavy concentration in financial services, fashion and retail companies, and tie-ins to films and television shows.
''Like anything, people had to get used to it,'' said Chris Polos, the company's vice president of sales and marketing.
To lure advertisers, agencies promote taxis as a closed, uncluttered environment that allows for direct engagement with an audience.
''Taxi riders are young, educated and upscale,'' reads a promotional pamphlet sent to potential clients by WABC, which provides programming for about half of the city's taxicabs.
The pamphlet claims that taxi passengers skew slightly female and that nearly half earn more than $100,000 a year. A 30-second advertisement running in half of the city's taxi fleet could be seen more than 200,000 times a day -- at a weekly cost of about $20,000.
The city is finalizing a two-year contract extension with Creative Mobile Technologies and VeriFone Systems, the vendors that install and operate the screens, and the revenue arrangement is not expected to change. (VeriFone Systems is the corporate parent of VeriFone Media Solutions.)
Taxicab owners must pay fees to the vendors in exchange for providing the screens, which also allow passengers to pay by credit card. Since owners must enter into individual contracts with the vendors, some have arranged for a cut of the advertising revenue, although this is not common across the industry.
Mr. Yassky, the taxi commissioner, said the televisions improved the quality of the taxi experience for passengers. There have been other benefits, too: the ability to pay by credit card, for example, has been credited with a rise in ridership despite the recession.
Mr. Yassky said that in lieu of demanding advertising revenue, the city hoped that the additional income for vendors might encourage them to lower the fees they charge to cab owners, which could in turn reduce the pressure to increase fares.
''I don't think advertising is so much an opportunity for city revenue,'' he said, ''so much as an opportunity to keep fares down.''

HEADLINE: In a New Albany, Cuomo Plans A Push to Cap Property Taxes

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Governor-elect Andrew M. Cuomo has a full plate awaiting him when he is inaugurated next month, including a gaping budget deficit. But Mr. Cuomo is already making clear to legislative leaders that one of his priorities is to cap local property taxes, which would have large consequences statewide for homeowners and school districts.
Three New York governors have tried, and failed, to limit local taxes, which are among the highest in the nation and a primary reason suburbanites and upstate residents say the state has become unaffordable.
But with the Senate all but certain to be controlled by the Republicans and voters in a tax-rebellion mood, Mr. Cuomo may be facing a more favorable political climate for a cap. 
''When this issue first came up, most people saw it as an arrow in the quiver of conservative Republicans,'' said Thomas R. Suozzi, a Democrat who is a former Nassau County executive and who headed the New York State Commission on Property Tax Relief in 2008. ''Now it has a broader base of support among Republicans and Democrats, with the deteriorating economic situation and rising property taxes.''
Mr. Cuomo is proposing a limit on the total amount of property tax dollars that can be collected annually by a school district, municipality or special district by capping the increase in the local tax levy at 2 percent or the rate of inflation, whichever is less, according to his campaign literature. Schools traditionally receive the largest share of property taxes. Over all, the amount that New York's schools have raised in property taxes -- their tax levy -- has climbed an average of 6.9 percent annually in the past decade, to a total of $29.1 billion in 2009, according to the state comptroller's office.
The proposal is tougher than tax cap efforts in some other states, allowing only ''narrow, limited exemptions'' to the cap, like for large legal settlements and extraordinary capital expenditures. It could, however, be overridden by local communities with a 60 percent vote.
School districts say a cap would have a devastating effect on their budgets, prompting layoffs, school closings and program cuts. The Democratic-controlled State Assembly and the powerful state teachers' union have opposed attempts to impose caps.
But in recent weeks, Mr. Cuomo and his staff have started promoting the cap in meetings and conversations with the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver; the Senate Democratic and Republican leaders, John L. Sampson and Dean G. Skelos; and New York State United Teachers. The talks have not focused on specifics, but all parties involved have told Mr. Cuomo or his aides that they are ''committed to finding common ground,'' according to legislative aides and union leaders.
By broaching the subject even before he picks his full cabinet or explains how he expects to close the state's budget gap, Mr. Cuomo is signaling the importance he places on a property tax cap.
''The property tax cap is a centerpiece of the governor-elect's agenda,'' said Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo. ''And he will move aggressively to see it implemented upon taking office so New Yorkers can finally receive relief from skyrocketing property taxes that are driving them from their homes and out of the state.'' Mr. Vlasto declined to elaborate on how the cap would work.
A cap would not directly affect New York City, where property taxes are relatively low because of revenue from the city's personal income tax, and where the schools are financed through the general city budget. But outside the city, New York is among the most heavily taxed states in the country. A 2010 report by the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group in Washington, found that the median property tax in New York was $3,755, compared with $1,917 in the United States.
Broken down into counties nationwide, Westchester and Nassau topped the list with $9,044 and $8,940, respectively, while Rockland was fifth with $8,542.
But Mr. Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan, said last week that his members, many of whom represent New York City, recognized the tax burden faced by homeowners. ''While this is a complex issue,'' Mr. Silver said in a statement, ''I believe that we'll be able to come to a meaningful agreement with Governor-elect Cuomo.''
Advocates for reining in the state's property taxes say that a cap would force school districts to spend less and bring long-term tax relief to homeowners. But opponents contend that a cap would squeeze school budgets in a year that already promises to be the toughest financially in recent years, and would force the most drastic cuts in programs and services in two decades.
They also say that it would take away local control of school finances, and only deepen inequities between middle- or low-income districts and affluent districts, where residents are more likely to override the cap.
In recent years, taxpayers throughout the state have been pressuring school and municipal officials to trim costs and consolidate services to stifle the rate of property tax increases. Similar developments have occurred in New Jersey, where the property tax burden also ranks high.
As such, Mr. Cuomo's cap would hit suburban schools at a time when many districts have already shed attractive offerings like Advanced Placement courses and art and music electives. Many districts have also laid off staff members, tapped into reserves and used up federal stimulus money, which had helped them avoid further cuts in the face of fast-rising pension, health care, utilities and special education costs.
Edmund J. McMahon, a frequent critic of New York's tax structure and a senior fellow at the Empire Center for New York State Policy in Albany, conceded that a cap would force districts to cut programs and services, but he said that would then pressure the State Legislature to undertake ''sweeping mandate relief.''
''School districts are past pros at crying wolf,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''But I think in this case they really would have to make significant cuts because they're locked into these costs, and because their state aid is probably also going to be cut.''
Mr. Cuomo has pledged to review all current state mandates and propose a ''sunset'' bill requiring that ''all unnecessary unfunded mandates'' be re-evaluated and eliminated unless affirmatively renewed.
A tax cap proposal surfaced as early as 1997 as part of Gov. George E. Pataki's School Tax Relief, or STAR, program, but it was dropped after opposition by legislators. It was later backed by Govs. Eliot Spitzer and David A. Paterson, who supports a 4 percent cap. This year, the Senate, which was narrowly controlled by Democrats, passed legislation for a 4 percent cap, but it has stalled in the Assembly.
Some fiscal experts say property tax caps simply shift the burden of paying for schools to other sources: income tax, sales tax, school fees and private fund-raising.
Critics have also noted that a cap would not lower taxes, only slow the rate of increase. ''Look, I'm a Long Islander who pays property taxes, so I understand what everyone is looking for,'' said Richard C. Iannuzzi, president of New York State United Teachers. ''It's just that they're looking at something that doesn't provide real property tax relief.''
The teachers' union and Assembly Democrats have instead advocated a so-called circuit-breaker, a state-financed program that would give tax breaks to people based on need. The Assembly even passed a bill in 2008. But, given the state's fiscal condition, some critics say it is unrealistic to expect more state financing for schools.
Frank Gerace, a Long Island financial adviser who pays $10,000 in property taxes on his 1970s-era four-bedroom house on a half-acre, said school districts could not keep asking for more from homeowners. Mr. Gerace was a founder of a citizens group, SchoolWatch, in 2006 that helped defeat a nearly 13 percent tax rate increase in the East Islip district.
''It will wake up districts and let them know they have a limited amount of funds they can work with,'' Mr. Gerace said. ''Right now some of them are run like country clubs.''

PAYING FOR IT: State rebates kept property tax increases low in the early part of the decade. When they stopped rising, homeowners faced big tax increases.

DAY OF RECKONING: Stimulus money is gone, and state aid is expected to decrease next year. But personnel costs continue to balloon, and that means big tax increases or large layoffs.

HEADLINE: Bankers in Energy Are in Short Supply

BYLINE: By ROB COX

 BODY:
Bankers in the oil and gas business know a thing or two about the laws of supply and demand. But they're not accustomed to being the commodity in question. Some of the world's cities may be overrun with financial types, but with energy sector activity rising, they're scarce in swampy, sprawling Houston. Bankers there may benefit accordingly in 2011.
As when rationalizing the price of crude, reasons for the popularity of energy specialists are easy to find. There are more buyers than ever for their talents, and there is a limited supply of professionals with both financial skills and those of a petroleum engineer or geophysicist. 
First, the demand side of the equation. By one recruiter's count, there are some two dozen managing director positions open in Houston at firms ranging from the advisory house Lazard to the Canadian powerhouse Bank of Montreal. Their hope is to grab a bigger slice of one of the few corporate finance fee pools that's expected to grow nicely in 2011. So far this year, energy deals worth $462 billion accounted for 21 percent of worldwide M.& A. -- the highest percentage on record, according to Thomson Reuters data. In the United States, the share was even higher, at 29 percent, making it the most active sector for deal making.
Wall Street's top banks are trying to retain their positions as consiglieres to titans like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. But at the same time, they're struggling to keep pace with the growing spectrum of equipment makers, seismic technologists, nimble drillers and pipeline operators whose valuations have been lifted by robust prices for crude, emerging markets' thirst for resources and in the United States, a boom natural gas activity.
Meantime, the global competition for hydrocarbons has brought new players into the business. Banks from Canada, Asia and Europe and are trying to keep up with the rapidly expanding horizons of once-domestically focused oil groups, like the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or Cnooc, and India's Reliance. That requires on-the-ground expertise not just in Houston, but in other centers of energy expertise like Calgary, Rio de Janeiro and Toronto.
Now, what about supply? As far as Houston is concerned, a Gulf of Mexico posting may sound like hardship next to Paris. But it's not just that Hermes-tied bankers don't fancy the blue-flamed landscape of Texas City's refineries at twilight.
To be a credible adviser in the oil patch, it also helps to have a background in the business -- for example, as a former petroleum engineer. Some gray hair and a Texas drawl can also make locally based clients feel more at home. Since many banks opened sizable outposts in Houston only over the past decade, the selection of qualified talent isn't that big.
That explains the case of Stephen M. Trauber. The former head of UBS's energy practice, along with a gaggle of colleagues, defected to Citigroup this year for a pay package that news reports pegged at $30 million. Because Citi already had a strong energy group -- it actually placed ahead of UBS in the corporate finance rankings -- Mr. Trauber was named one of three co-heads.
Remarkably, Citi has thus far managed to retain the bulk of its existing team. The end result is that despite the movement of the UBS team, no new supply has been put into the market. UBS has simply joined the list of banks trying to beef up their presence.
There are ways to shortcut the Houston talent gap. Some banks say they might dispatch troops from cities where energy corporate finance activity, and the ability to generate juicy fees, has slowed of late, including London and Dubai.
The other option is to buy one of Houston's smaller boutiques. That's what Merrill Lynch did in 2006 with the purchase of Petrie Parkman. At the time, Merrill was struggling to rebuild its energy business after a scandal involving Nigerian barges and Enron. Independent firms like Simmons & Company and Tudor, Pickering, Holt say they're not interested in selling, as they're too busy making lots of money.
But the founder of Simmons, focused on the oil field service and equipment industry, died this year. And three-year-old Tudor, Pickering is about to embark on global expansion. Economic logic would suggest that one of the many banks hoping to satisfy demand for a Houston buildup with limited supply will soon be sniffing around.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Rules Out Bid For White House in 2012

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Despite renewed speculation about his presidential aspirations, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Sunday categorically ruled out running for the White House in 2012 in an appearance on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. 
Mr. Bloomberg said that he was ''not looking at the possibility of running,'' and that he would not change his mind even if his advisers believed he could win.
''No way, no how?'' the show's host, David Gregory, asked.
''No way, no how,'' Mr. Bloomberg repeated.
The mayor said he was urging his supporters to ''cease and desist'' in stirring up talk about his interest in a candidacy, adding, ''But most of this is just because the press wants to have something to write about.''
''I want to go out having a reputation as a very good, maybe the greatest mayor ever,'' he said.
The speculation about Mr. Bloomberg's ambitions for a White House bid flared anew last week when the mayor, speaking in Brooklyn, disparaged Congress and President Obama for their management of the economy. While his speech on Wednesday sounded campaignlike, Mr. Bloomberg has ruled out a 2012 run many times in the past.
''I'm not going to run for president,'' he said on Sunday, adding, ''I've got a great job. I'm going to finish out my 1,100 and whatever number of days it is left to go, and I'll leave the politics to the experts.''
At several points in the interview, the mayor praised Mr. Obama, saying he deserved more credit, support and patience -- countering remarks from his speech in Brooklyn and from a recent issue of GQ magazine, in which Mr. Bloomberg suggested that Mr. Obama ''needs some better advisers.''
He added, ''He campaigns, 'I'm going to do A,' then he doesn't do it.''
On Sunday, the mayor elaborated on those comments, saying that the president needed advisers with business experience who could tell him ''what the real world is about.''
One of those potential advisers was Roger C. Altman, a prominent Wall Street investment banker and Treasury deputy secretary in the Clinton administration, who could become the next director of Mr. Obama's National Economic Council.
Mr. Bloomberg said Mr. Altman would ''be perfect.''
The mayor said that Mr. Obama deserved praise for working out a deal with Republican leaders to retain Bush-era tax cuts for two years and extend unemployment benefits.
''Both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue have finally come together to do something in a bipartisan way,'' he said.

HEADLINE: And the Oscar for Teaching Goes to ...

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Teacher Ratings Get New Look, Pushed by a Very Rich Observer'' (front page, Dec. 4), about the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's project to expand the use of video to rate teachers:
It is naive to think that a ''cottage industry,'' in which ''retired principals, or even expert teachers'' score thousands of hours of teacher videos, will improve teaching. 
The real problem is the lack of collaboration between novice and expert teachers. For example, we don't expect coaches to work at a distance, rating their athletes. There is a relationship between coach and athlete, and trust that the feedback will improve the athlete's performance.
Why would anyone think that scoring a teacher's performance in isolation would be sufficient for improvement?
Susan C. Styer Aurora, Ill., Dec. 4, 2010
The writer is the curriculum and assessment leader for science at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy.
To the Editor:
In 1972, at the University of Buffalo, I was fortunate to be part of a select group of young women who spent their entire senior year teaching kindergarten through sixth grade. We then analyzed videos of our lessons with a Ph.D. candidate. It was a profound and enlightening experience that proved invaluable in shaping my career.
Now, 38 years later, Bill Gates has reinvented the wheel.
Jane Lombardi Hempstead, N.Y., Dec. 4, 2010
To the Editor:
Have the big brains or big money investing millions of dollars to develop new measurements of classroom results thought about investing the same amounts to reduce class size? We already know that lower class size results in more effective teaching and improved learning. Rating teachers who have oversized classes is fruitless.

To the Editor:
New methods of rating teachers and the finding that most teachers are scoring better than was expected are not news to many in the education field. The recording of lessons by new teachers, with critiques by experienced subject matter teachers from other districts, was standard practice in Connecticut when I was teaching in the 1990s.
This process was primarily intended to help young instructors improve their techniques, but also to offer school districts information before granting tenure.
That this method is now being fostered by Bill Gates's foundation satisfies the longstanding demand of professionals -- new and experienced -- to have access to peer review, in order to improve their teaching in a way that is supportive rather than threatening.

To the Editor:
Teaching is an important job, but so is being a surgeon or a lawyer or a chief executive on Wall Street. Can you imagine those professionals having their every move monitored by video cameras and evaluated by strangers using some arcane point system? It would seem shockingly invasive and demeaning.
I wonder if Bill Gates would ever consider treating them with such disrespect.
Despite the presumed good intentions, Mr. Gates's program reveals the kind of prejudice about teachers that pervades almost every conversation on the topic. We have come to diminish the stature of teachers while simultaneously believing that they have the most important jobs in the world.
Teachers deserve to be evaluated by people who understand and can observe firsthand the complex, subtle messiness of classroom interactions. Good teachers have the interpersonal magic that excites and elevates the human spirit of their students in a way that cannot be reduced to points.
Dehumanizing teaching, as this program will most certainly do, is not the way to improve education.

To the Editor:
I was disappointed that your article about teacher evaluations gave little attention to how classroom videos will be scored and who will score them.
Thomas J. Kane, the Harvard economist leading the video project, envisions videos being taken in millions of classrooms. Does he really think there will be enough ''retired principals, or even expert teachers'' out there who are willing to score them?
Catherine A. McClellan, a director for the Educational Testing Service working on the Gates project, said she plans to train hundreds of educators to score video lessons.
Yet E.T.S. and other test-scoring companies have been known to label the low-paid, poorly trained temporary workers whom they hire to score standardized tests as ''professionals.''
I spent the last three years scoring tests, and I have seen the process at work. I think a healthy dose of suspicion is necessary, to say the least.

HEADLINE: On Drilling, Pleasing Both Sides

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
On the surface, it looked as if Gov. David A. Paterson threaded the needle over the weekend when he addressed one of the most far-reaching environmental and economic issues facing New York: the future of natural gas drilling upstate.
On Saturday, Mr. Paterson vetoed legislation that would have placed a moratorium on drilling that uses a technique called hydraulic fracturing, which involves injecting millions of gallons of chemically treated water underground to crush shale and release the gas inside. Instead, he issued an executive order instituting a longer moratorium that extended until July 1, 2011, but that more narrowly defined the types of drilling to be restricted. 
In apparent contradiction of the laws of physics, both the gas industry and the environmentalists seemed pleased.
''IOGA of N.Y. praises Governor David Paterson for courageous veto of moratorium bill,'' began the statement from the Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York.
''We're hopeful that the governor's veto today will set the stage for a more reasoned and rational public discussion about these issues going forward,'' said the group's executive director, Brad Gill.
The environmental group Catskill Mountainkeeper called the same action a ''historic victory for the citizens of New York State.'' Kate Sinding, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said it was the first time a state imposed a moratorium on the industry. ''I think it sets the tone for the next administration that New York is not going to get rolled like other states have been,'' she said.
Beneath the surface, things were not so balmy. The industry deems any moratorium unnecessary and misguided. Environmentalists were almost as hyperbolic about what they did not like -- allowing vertical rather than the more obtrusive horizontal hydrofracking in emerging gas fields upstate -- as they were about what they did.
Still, the basic dynamic showed two things: the future of gas drilling in New York remains up for grabs, and the issue has now been tossed into the lap of the incoming governor, Andrew M. Cuomo.
To noncombatants, gas drilling remains an impenetrable and distant issue, an inherent my-eyes-glaze-over topic. But increasingly, for the industry, upstate landowners, farmers, environmentalists, for people concerned with water, food and the state's economy, it is becoming inescapable. When New York's oil and gas industry emerges from decades of total obscurity and the Park Slope Food Co-op feels obligated to weigh in with its policy statement on hydrofracking, you can assume the issue is reaching critical mass.
NEW YORK has already taken steps to bring down the temperature of the debate by limiting (but not eliminating) the opportunity to drill in the New York City Watershed. Yet the economic and environmental stakes remain enormous. And to many, natural gas remains a more palatable option than other available energy sources.
Still, it's not at all clear how much long-term economic activity gas exploration would bring.
Susan Christopherson, an economic geographer at Cornell, said that almost 70 percent of the economic gains would go to upstate landowners and that most of the industry jobs and long-term economic gains would go elsewhere.
''The oil and gas industry is much more like financial services than manufacturing,'' she said. ''You don't have continuous jobs and long-term production. What you usually get is a boom and bust cycle.''
Economic and environmental doubts are unlikely to derail drilling in the Marcellus Shale, the rich gas fields in New York, Pennsylvania and nearby states. But industry critics say they are an argument for going slow and ensuring best practices in drilling to avoid some of the environmental degradation experienced across the border in Pennsylvania.
The next big issues will be the future of the environmental review process that has produced a draft policy environmentalists would like to scrap, and calls for extending the moratorium pending a federal review that could take two years. Both seem like uphill battles in a state desperate for more economic activity and tax revenue.
Mr. Paterson on his way out the door found an issue in which he was able to split the difference and make everyone happy. Mr. Cuomo should be so lucky.

HEADLINE: A Fight for the 2012 Democratic Convention

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Not many Democrats rushed last week to support President Obama's compromise tax package. But among the first was Anthony Foxx, the mayor of this gleaming city of the New South.
And little wonder. Charlotte is competing with three other finalists -- Cleveland, Minneapolis and St. Louis -- to host the Democratic National Convention in 2012. Right on cue, the mayors of those three cities (and others) quickly followed suit, also signaling their support for the president.
At this stage, anything might tip the scales in one city's favor, so the four cities are eager to please.
The Republicans announced months ago that they would hold their 2012 convention in Tampa, Fla., and the Democrats had expected to announce their decision by the end of this month. 
They still could, of course, but Mr. Obama may not have a chance until early next year to focus on where he wants to stage his all-but-certain presidential nomination.
Despite the challenges of accommodating tens of thousands of conventioneers, cities vying to be the host expect to benefit from an injection of millions of dollars into their local economies and a blast of free publicity.
Democratic officials say their main criteria are logistical. And generally, they say, cities do not make it to the finals unless they meet certain basic requirements, like providing enough hotel rooms. They also consider the size of the airport and local transportation systems. An ability to raise about $40 million from private sources before the convention, scheduled for early September 2012, is another plus.
Whatever city Mr. Obama picks -- in the end, it is his decision -- he is not guaranteed of carrying the state where the convention is held. In fact, as often as not, the Democratic nominee has lost the host state, according to a new study from the University of Minnesota.
Since the first Democratic convention, held in Baltimore in 1832, the study found, the nominee has lost the host state 23 times and won it 22 times.
So, bearing in mind that there is no automatic convention ''bounce'' in the polls, here is a look at the pros and cons of the four finalists.
Charlotte A Southern Surprise
Pick It:
Of all the states Mr. Obama won in 2008, North Car-
olina was among the biggest surprises, breaking the
Republicans' firm grip on the South. Charlotte's slo-
gan for the convention is ''Reaching for Tomorrow.''
Having Mr. Obama here for the convention would
acknowledge the state's importance and could inspire
students and blacks, who voted heavily for him in
2008, to go to the polls again.
A compact downtown would make the convention
pedestrian friendly. Entertainment venues include
the Charlotte Motor Speedway and the Nascar Hall of
Fame (welcome, Reagan Democrats), and the Na-
tional Whitewater Center, with its artificial river. Va-
cationing families have the choice of mountains to the
west or ocean to the east.
Skip It:
Capturing North Carolina again or picking
up another Southern state may be a long
shot, so perhaps another city is a better bet.
The last time Democrats convened in the
South, in 1988 in Atlanta, they lost the entire
region (and most of the country).
Some Democrats may be uncomfortable
with Charlotte's image as the nation's sec-
ond-biggest banking center, after New York,
and its banks were major recipients of bail-
out money. North Carolina is a right-to-work
state, and Charlotte has no union hotels.
Is the downtown too compact for tens of
thousands of conventioneers? Will the
weather be too hot and humid?
St. Louis A Familiar Destination
Pick It:
St. Louis has hosted four national conventions for Demo-
crats and one for Republicans, making it the most practiced
city of the bunch, though the last time Democrats met here
was in 1916. Still, there is little doubt about the city's ability to
handle a major convention.
Missouri, a swing state, is centrally located. And in its quest
for the convention, it boasts the support of neighboring Illinois,
the home state of the man who will decide which city wins.
St. Louis, along with Minneapolis, was recommended by
Unite Here, the hotel workers' union, for having the most un-
ionized facilities.
The city held a concert this year with Chuck Berry and Nelly
to whip up grass-roots excitement for the convention. St. Louis
is also the only city of the four that can claim an iconic symbol,
the Gateway Arch.
Skip It:
Missouri has been a disappoint-
ment to Democrats in recent years
Mr. Obama narrowly lost the state
in 2008; this year, the Democratic
Senate candidate lost in a landslid
St. Louis is an older city and
might have a harder time projectin
a message that suggests somethin
new about the party.
Its population growth has been
slow, and Missouri could lose an
electoral vote after redistricting.
Cleveland A Battleground Contender
Pick It:
Ohio is a true battleground state, and, along with
Florida, has been the big prize in the last few elections.
Democrats cannot win without it. The fact that Demo-
crats did so badly here in the midterm elections should
be all the more reason for the party to plant the flag
with its convention. And Ohio has more electoral votes,
20, than any other state vying for the convention.
Cleveland officials argue that the city would be the
most affordable of the four choices, with lower hotel
rates and less-expensive dining options.
Other venues in the city include the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame, the renowned Cleveland Orchestra and
Playhouse Square, and the Cleveland Museum of Art.
Skip It:
Can Cleveland raise expectations for con-
ventioneers about visiting a Rust Belt city
that does not exactly scream excitement?
Can the city raise the necessary cash?
National Democratic officials were deeply
disappointed this fall when Cleveland only
half-filled a university arena for an Obama
rally just two days before the midterm elec-
tions.
Several Cuyahoga County Democrats are
under corruption investigations. And Cleve-
land's main convention center is smaller
than those in the other cities.
Minneapolis A Repeat Competitor
Pick It:
The Republican National Convention was
successfully staged in this neck of the woods
in 2008. Minneapolis's confidence is reflected
in its convention slogan: ''Resourceful. Reli-
able. Ready.''
The union that represents thousands of ho-
tel workers is urging the Democrats to hold
the convention here or in St. Louis because
they have so many unionized facilities.
The city's mayor, R. T. Rybak, was the first
such official in the country to endorse Barack
Obama for president and has been extremely
supportive of his administration.
Skip It:
The Republicans just held their convention in the
twin city St. Paul in 2008. Why do a replay so soon?
Also, if Mr. Obama cannot win the reliably Democratic
Minnesota, he has probably lost the 2012 election any-
way.
The roof of the Metrodome, the likely venue for the
convention, deflated Sunday under two feet of snow.
This has happened a few times in the past, providing a
publicity challenge for convention organizers.
Various progressives and activists are working
against a Minneapolis bid, saying they do not want a
repeat of what they said were civil liberties violations
during the 2008 convention, including mass arrests.

HEADLINE: More Benefits For the Middle In Tax Details

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the Senate poised to hold a key vote on Monday on the tax cut deal between President Obama and Republicans, the political jousting has focused on what the agreement does for the wealthy by extending all of the Bush-era tax rates, and for the unemployed, by continuing jobless aid.
But a hefty portion of the $858 billion tax package will benefit middle- and upper-middle-income Americans -- precisely the demographic that felt neglected the last two years as the White House and Congress focused on the major health care law and on helping the unemployed and people facing foreclosure. 
These new tax breaks are in addition to the cuts Mr. Obama had always planned to maintain on all but the highest incomes, and they could pay big political dividends to Mr. Obama and other Democrats in 2012 -- a point that the president and some senior advisers are counting on, and one reason that they were willing to give in to Republican demands to extend all Bush-era tax rates.
Austan Goolsbee, the chairman the White House Council of Economic Advisers, appearing Sunday on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC, said Mr. Obama was still convinced there was no economic benefit to continuing lower tax rates for the highest earners.
''That's a bitter pill to have to deal with,'' Mr. Goolsbee said. ''But it's a compromise, and by giving that one piece we were able to get a series of things that I think make a big difference to the middle class and working families.''
The full scope of those goodies is fully discernible only by poring over the bill and its head-spinning array of provisions
The single most expensive component of the package -- other than the continuation of all of the marginal rates -- is a two-year adjustment of the alternative minimum tax, to prevent it from hitting millions more households. This would exempt couples' income up to $72,450 in 2010 and $74,450 in 2011 at a cost of $137 billion, according to a detailed cost analysis by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.
Middle- and upper-middle-income Americans will also benefit most from the one-year payroll tax cut, which will reduce the Social Security tax on income up to $106,800 to 4.2 percent from 6.2 percent. For couples with two incomes, each above the maximum, the tax savings will be $4,272. That provision will cost $112 billion.
The extension of jobless benefits, by contrast, will cost just under $57 billion, according to the joint tax committee.
And other provisions that benefit the middle class have gotten virtually no attention, including a temporary repeal of a limit on itemized deductions and repeal of the phaseout for personal exemptions. Together, those tax breaks will cost nearly $21 billion.
Mr. Goolsbee said the White House was betting that after a two-year extension of tax policies of President George W. Bush, it would be far harder for Republicans to defend the tax cuts for the wealthy in 2012, when the economy is expected to be stronger, thereby weakening their argument that allowing tax rates to rise for the rich would hamper the recovery.
''In 2012, I believe they will have to stand up and defend, on their own merits, that they think these high-income tax cuts work,'' he said. ''And they will not be able to do that because they don't.''
While the full political ramifications will not be known for months or longer, it was increasingly clear on Sunday that the tax deal would move forward.
Reluctant House Democrats predicted that the package would be approved before Congress adjourns this year, as days of rage and frustration began giving way to resignation and acceptance.
Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who represented House Democrats in the formal negotiations during the tax debate, said his caucus would still push to change the tax plan, particularly a provision granting a generous tax exclusion to wealthy estates. But he conceded that Democrats were not prepared to stop the entire package.
''We're not going to hold this thing up at the end of the day,'' Mr. Van Hollen said in an interview on ''Fox News Sunday.'' Still, he said House Democrats were intent on testing Republicans' willingness to insist on keeping the estate tax provision, with its exemption of $5 million per person and maximum rate of 35 percent, for the next two years.
But Republicans have said they would not accept any major adjustment to the deal negotiated with the White House. Appearing on the same show, Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said he viewed Mr. Van Hollen's remarks as a flag of surrender.
Mr. Van Hollen, in a telephone interview later on Sunday, said he had not intended to signal any change in strategy or position. ''In its current form it is not acceptable to the Democratic caucus,'' he said.
And he would not predict what would happen if House Democrats changed the provision. ''That's a question for another day,'' he said
But he added, ''We do want to get this resolved by the end of the year.''
The Senate was set to hold a procedural vote on Monday and was likely to give final approval on Tuesday. And Mr. Van Hollen's remarks suggested that the entire package could be approved by the end of this week.
In the Senate, Democrats were quicker to accept that Mr. Obama's tradeoff could help reverse the party's political misfortune, in which important swing voters, especially independents and women, turned toward the Republicans.
Some Senate Democrats, particularly those who, like Mr. Obama, are up for re-election in 2012, have called for a laserlike focus on the middle class in the months ahead. And while some will undoubtedly vote against the tax plan, others like Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, have quickly become vociferous supporters. Mr. Webb, who is up for re-election in 2012, has called the package ''the ultimate stimulus plan.''
Online Correction: December 13, 2010, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version misstated the income levels that would be exempt from the alternative minimum tax.

HEADLINE: Detroit's Monsters Thrive On a Diet of Cheap Gas

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Maria Eugenia Diaz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela -- Ascending the narrow streets that wind through this city's hillside slums, the graffiti steadily gets more radical and anti-American, repeatedly proclaiming ''Yankees go home!'' amid murals denouncing President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
But at the same time, the cars get bigger -- as in '70s-style, gas-guzzling, Starsky-and-Hutch, Ford-Gran-Torino big -- and American. 
''We like our cars to be like tanks in this country, meaning they should be huge, comfortable and preferably manufactured in the United States,'' said Miguel Delgado, 52, a mechanic in Los Frailes, a slum on this city's western fringe, where he was working on a 1976 Dodge Coronet and a 1979 Chevrolet Impala.
The survival here of so many retro-chic American gas hogs, from Plymouth Valiants to Dodge Aspens and Chrysler New Yorkers, owes partly to the vagaries of Venezuela's recent history and partly to its oil wealth. Motorists say that they drive these cars simply because they can. They smile when they hear that gasoline prices in the United States average about $3 a gallon, and much higher in parts of Europe.
Venezuela provides what might be the most generous fuel subsidy anywhere. Gasoline, currently less than 10 cents a gallon, is the cheapest in the world, undercutting even Saudi Arabia and Iran, other top oil-exporting nations, according to a study of global fuel prices by the German aid agency GTZ.
While Venezuela is a major oil producer, the subsidy still costs the government more than $9 billion a year. For all his populism, President Hugo Chavez has lamented its drain on public finances, calling gasoline prices ''disgusting.''
But he has not touched the subsidy, which many Venezuelans consider a birthright. An increase in fuel prices in 1989 helped set off riots in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, were killed.
Today filling the tank of a 1974 Lincoln Continental, a 19-foot-long monster with a V-8 engine and mileage in the low teens, costs about $1, including a small tip for the gas-station attendant. ''It's a super-economical car,'' said Jose Pereira, 41, the proud owner of one such model.
Many of the vintage land yachts tooling around Caracas today were imported during the heyday of ''Venezuela Saudita,'' Saudi Venezuela, in the early 1970s, when oil prices quadrupled and this developing nation became flush with petrodollars.
A sort of proto-Chavez populist president, Carlos Andres Perez, nationalized the oil industry, sent aid to Bolivia and tried to turn Venezuela into a player in the developing world. A Concorde flight linked Caracas to Paris. So many Venezuelan shoppers flocked to Miami that they were called ''dame dos,'' Spanish for ''give me two.''
''My car reminds me of the era when Venezuela was the envy of Latin America,'' said Jesus Regalado, 68, a taxi driver who still cruises the city in his 1975 Dodge Dart, which he bought new thanks to a government financing program.
Much has changed since then. Oil prices plunged in the 1980s, and in the ensuing tumult, Mr. Chavez, then an obscure military officer, led an unsuccessful 1992 coup attempt against Mr. Perez. After his release from prison, Mr. Chavez had better luck with electoral politics, winning the presidency in 1998 and turning Venezuela from a country where the United States wielded considerable influence to a thorn in Washington's side.
His new political alliances and another roaring oil boom, which ended abruptly in 2008, lined the roads with newer cars. An Iranian venture now manufactures a four-door sedan here called the Turpial. Officials have begun importing thousands of Russian Ladas.
In the capital's wealthier districts, S.U.V.'s like Jeep Cherokees, Ford Expeditions, even the occasional Hummer, vie for space in clogged thoroughfares with smaller Toyotas, Daewoos, Hondas and Hyundais. Thousands of motorbike couriers weave through the gridlock, adding to the chaos.
Despite the newer cars, the low growl of American guzzlers still cuts through the din of traffic, evoking in some ways the love affair that people in Cuba, Venezuela's top ally, have with pre-1960 American automobiles.
Some motorists say they buy the cars because spare parts are easily available. Others buy them to hedge against Venezuela's high inflation. Used cars hold their value remarkably well here: a 1979 Ford LTD Landau, for instance, sells for about $5,200 here compared with about $1,500 in the United States.
Still, the eight-cylinder workhorses remain cheaper than newer models, explaining their prevalence in some poor districts of Caracas and other cities. But the affection for the aging American giants that saves so many of them from the crushers cannot be explained by economics alone.
''I love my Fairlane precisely because it is American,'' said Freddy Gomez, 54, a deliveryman in this city's gritty Boleita district who drives a red 1974 Ford Fairlane. Grinning with a hint of mischief, he pointed to a decal on the Fairlane's rear window, which showed a mathematical equation involving the Ford logo plus a bottle of spirits plus a female figure. The sum: a couple in an amorous embrace.
''When people see me driving my Fairlane, they know I'm a man of style,'' he said. ''This car is the F-16 of the highways, friend,'' he added, referring to the American warplanes, acquired before diplomatic relations soured with Washington and still flown by Venezuela's Air Force.
But many of the aging American fleet seem more like rusting turboprops than sleek fighter jets.
A 1975 Chevrolet Nova parked in the Pedregal slum had its hood tied down with string and Yosemite Sam mats on the floor. Its paint job, in hues of brown, looked like the work of a would-be Mark Rothko, punctured with dings and dents.
''Yeah, my Nova has about 30 of them,'' said its owner, Marcelino Rojas, 50, a house painter.
The rubber-burning days of some of these cars might be nearing an end. News reaching here from Detroit these days speaks of exotic new electric cars like the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf. The announcement that General Motors was pulling the plug on Pontiac, the 84-year-old brand whose sales peaked in 1973, drew gasps among some Venezuelans.
''I find it hard to believe that the Americans would let Pontiac expire like that,'' said Oswaldo Valdes, 21, a university student who owns a 1970 Pontiac Grand Prix. ''In this country, this great automobile has decades of life ahead of it.''

HEADLINE: THE CAUCUS; Democrats Adjust To a Downswing

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Until now, the Congressional career of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been a story of ascent.
First elected in 2004, the Florida Democrat became a prodigious fund-raiser who helped her party recapture the House two years later, and later received a coveted Appropriations subcommittee chairmanship. Since last month's elections, in which Ms. Wasserman Schultz was re-elected but Republicans snatched back the majority, she has discovered downward mobility.
Today, Ms. Wasserman Schultz is scrambling to keep her membership on Appropriations, and protect the staff aides whose jobs are at risk. ''It's the shrinking pains of serving in the minority,'' she said. ''There's a lot of angst.'' 
In the lame-duck session of Congress, that angst fuels the rebellion by House Democrats against the tax-cut compromise President Obama struck with Republican leaders. Their resistance reflects ideological opposition to tax cuts for affluent Americans, but also status anxiety as their four years of majority control draw to a close.
Republicans who experienced the same thing in 2006 know it will not get easier soon.
''I think they're having a much harder time coming to grips with it even than we did,'' said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. ''If they're this disappointed now when they're still in the majority, wait until January.''
Shifting to the Left
An earlier generation of Democrats felt the reversal more acutely. When Republicans led by Newt Gingrich won the House in 1994, they ended 40 years of Democratic control.
''It's painful and very hard to accept,'' said former Representative Vic Fazio of California, then a member of the Democratic leadership. Now a Washington lobbyist, he has been fielding calls from defeated Democratic members asking, ''What do I do?''
In the mid-1990s, House Democrats bridled at President Bill Clinton's compromise with Republicans on overhauling the welfare system. After working closely with Democrats in his first two years, Mr. Clinton redoubled his efforts thereafter to avoid full-scale defections as he governed from the center.
What complicated Mr. Clinton's task, as it does for Mr. Obama now, was the leftward shift in the Democratic caucus resulting from the defeat of moderates representing swing districts. That shift increased the influence of members from liberal-leaning districts whose greatest vulnerability lay in primary challenges rather than general elections.
So it is no surprise that the incumbent brought in his Democratic predecessor last week to help quell the intraparty revolt over extending President George W. Bush's tax cuts.
''A lot of them are hurting now, and I get it,'' Mr. Clinton said at the White House. But he urged Democrats to accept ''the best bipartisan agreement we can reach'' for helping the middle class and the economy over all.
Considering the shifting dynamics in the capital, a Democratic revolt was ''probably unavoidable,'' Mr. Fazio said. And it will preserve suspense for the floor vote, though he echoed predictions from White House officials and leadership aides that enough Democrats will back the compromise to enable it to pass.
''A lot of Democrats would not want it to go down, but don't want to vote for it,'' Mr. Fazio said. ''It will be a close vote for that reason.''
Battling the Leader
Having ended Republicans' 12-year reign in 2006, House Democrats know their minority status need not be permanent. But they face immediate obstacles, including Mr. Obama's focus on his own re-election, a shift of donations toward the new majority, and the temptation for some Democratic veterans to retire rather than wage a comeback fight.
What aggravates them all the more is the belief that Mr. Obama's administration is partly responsible for their predicament. Republicans felt the same way about President Bush after their 2006 defeat, which stemmed largely from public unhappiness over the Iraq war.
Still, ''we hung tight with the president'' and supported the troop increase, Mr. Cole recalled. The policy merits aside, he added, Republicans concluded that ''it doesn't help for us to fight with the president.''
Once the lame-duck session gives way to a new Congress in 2011, Democrats who keep battling Mr. Obama risk undermining the top of their own 2012 ticket. ''If the president is not successful,'' Mr. Cole observed, ''they will not be back in the majority.''
Ms. Wasserman Schultz said she had not decided how to vote on the tax-cut compromise. But she praised Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for making ''a good case'' for it at a party caucus -- and she urged the White House to recognize that Democrats at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue need one another.
''We want to make sure we're not going to be left out of this equation,'' she noted. ''That's what's being expressed through this frustration over the tax deal -- that we aren't just an afterthought.''

HEADLINE: The Ideal Ballerina

BYLINE: TARA PARKER-POPE


HIGHLIGHT: A ballerina, criticized for her weight, argues that that skilled ballerinas come in all shapes and sizes. 

 BODY:
In a now infamous review, the New York Times dance critic Alastair Macaulay criticized the body of dancer Jenifer Ringer, who is cast as the Sugar Plum Fairy in "George Balanchine's The Nutcracker" at the New York City Ballet. The dancer, Mr. Macaulay wrote, "looked as if she'd eaten one sugarplum too many." 
The comment triggered a storm of protest among readers and on the Internet. Mr. Macaulay defended his remarks with a thoughtful essay entitled "Judging the Bodies in Ballet.''
While I understand the general point made by Mr. Macaulay about the role of criticism, I am still searching for the extra pounds he spotted on Ms. Ringer, who clearly isn't overweight by any standard. More important, I'm troubled by the suggestion that an emaciated dancer is somehow more pleasing to watch. To my eye, Ms. Ringer, who has talked openly about struggling with disordered eating, looks like the ideal ballerina -- an athletic, graceful woman who dances with strength. 
In an appearance on NBC's "Today" show, Ms. Ringer said that she was initially hurt by the criticism, but she also notes that an ultra thin ballerina isn't necessarily the ideal.
It's a physical profession. We're dancing all day long.... But if you're too thin, you can't do the job. That's where people run into trouble. When I went through my eating disorders, I went through anorexia; when you're weak, you can't do the job, and you can't perform it well.
As a dancer, I do put myself out there to be criticized, and my body is part of my art form. At the same time, I'm not overweight. I do have, I guess, a more womanly body type than the stereotypical ballerina, but that's one of the wonderful things about the New York City Ballet. We have every body type you can imagine. We have tall, we have petite, we have athletic, we have womanly, we have waif-like. We have every body type out there. They can all dance like crazy. They are all gorgeous, and I think dance should be more of a celebration of that -- seeing these beautiful women with these different bodies all dancing to this gorgeous music, and that's what should be celebrated.

HEADLINE: Ben Franklin's Nation

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
After you read this column, go to YouTube and search ''Hans Rosling and 200 countries.'' You'll see a Swedish professor describe the growth of global wealth and well-being over the past 200 years.
He presents an animated time-lapse chart. It starts in 1810, when the nations of the world were clumped on the bottom left-hand side of the chart because they had low income and low life expectancy. Then the industrial revolution kicks in and the nations of the West surge upward and to the right as they get richer and healthier. By 1948, it's like a race, with the United States out front and the other nations of the world stretched in a long tail behind. 
Then, over the last few decades, the social structure of the world changes. The Asian and Latin American countries begin to catch up. With the exception of the African nations, living standards start to converge. Now most countries are clumped toward the top end of the chart, thanks to the incredible reductions in global poverty and improvements in health.
This convergence is great news, but the change in the global social structure has created a psychological crisis in the U.S. Since World War II, we've built our national identity on our rank among the nations -- at the front with everybody else trailing behind. But in this age of convergence, the world doesn't have much of a tail anymore.
Some people interpret this loss of lead-dog status as a sign of national decline.
Other people think we are losing our exceptionalism. But, the truth is, there's just been a change in the shape of the world community. In a world of relative equals, the U.S. will have to learn to define itself not by its rank, but by its values. It will be important to have the right story to tell, the right purpose and the right aura. It will be more important to know who you are.
Americans seem uncertain about how to answer that question. But one answer is contained in Rosling's chart. What is the core feature of the converging world? It is the rise of a gigantic global middle class.
In 2000, the World Bank classified 430 million people as middle class. By 2030, there will be about 1.5 billion. In India alone, the ranks of the middle class will swell from 50 million to 583 million.
To be middle class is to have money to spend on non-necessities. But it also involves a shift in values. Middle-class parents have fewer kids but spend more time and money cultivating each one. They often adopt the bourgeois values -- emphasizing industry, prudence, ambition, neatness, order, moderation and continual self-improvement. They teach their children to lead different lives from their own, and as Karl Marx was among the first to observe, unleash a relentless spirit of improvement and openness that alters every ancient institution.
Last year, the Pew Research Center surveyed the global middle class and found that middle-class people are more likely than their poorer countrymen to value democracy, free speech and an objective judiciary. They were more likely to embrace religious pluralism and say that you don't have to believe in God to be good.
Over the next few decades, a lot of people are going to get rich selling education, self-help and mobility tools to the surging global bourgeoisie. The United States has a distinct role to play in this world.
American culture was built on the notion of bourgeois dignity. We've always been lacking in aristocratic grace and we've never had much proletarian consciousness, but America did produce Ben Franklin, one of the original spokesmen of middle-class values. It did produce Horatio Alger, who told stories about poor boys and girls who rose to middle-class respectability. It does produce a nonstop flow of self-help leaders, from Dale Carnegie to Oprah Winfrey. It did produce the suburbs and a new sort of middle-class dream.
Americans could well become the champions of the gospel of middle-class dignity. The U.S. could become the crossroads nation for those who aspire to join the middle and upper-middle class, attracting students, immigrants and entrepreneurs.
To do this, we'd have to do a better job of celebrating and defining middle-class values. We'd have to do a better job of nurturing our own middle class. We'd have to have the American business class doing what it does best: catering to every nook and cranny of the middle-class lifestyle. And we'd have to emphasize that capitalism didn't create the American bourgeoisie. It was the social context undergirding capitalism -- the community clubs, the professional societies, the religious charities and Little Leagues.
For centuries, people have ridiculed American culture for being tepid, materialistic and middle class. But Ben Franklin's ideas won in the end. The middle-class century could be another American century.

HEADLINE: What Ike Got Right

BYLINE: By JAMES LEDBETTER. 
James Ledbetter is the author of the forthcoming ''Unwarranted Influence: Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Military-Industrial Complex.''

 BODY:
LAST week the National Archives released a trove of drafts and notes that shed new light on President Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell address, in which he warned America about the ''military-industrial complex.''
The release comes just in time for the speech's 50th anniversary next month. And so while scholars and historians use these documents to scrutinize the evolution of the speech's famous phrase, it's worth asking a broader question: does America still have a military-industrial complex, and should we be as worried about it as Eisenhower was? 
By one measure, the answer to the first question is yes. Over the past 50 years there have been very few years in which the United States has spent less on the military than it did the year before.
This has remained true whether the country is actively fighting a war, whether it has an obvious and well-armed enemy or whether Democrats or Republicans run the White House and Congress. Despite regular expectations that the United States will enjoy a peace dividend, we continue to spend more on the military than the countries with the next 15 largest military budgets combined.
Such perpetual growth seems to confirm Eisenhower's concern about the size and influence of the military. It used to be, he said, that armies should grow and shrink as needed; in the Biblical metaphor of the speech, he observed that ''American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well.''
But World War II and the early cold war changed that dynamic, creating what Eisenhower called ''a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions.'' It is not a stretch to believe that this armaments industry -- which profits not only from domestic sales but also from tens of billions of dollars in annual exports -- manipulates public policy to perpetuate itself.
But Eisenhower was concerned about more than just the military's size; he also worried about its relationship to the American economy and society, and that the economy risked becoming a subsidiary of the military. His alarm was understandable: at the time the military represented over half of all government spending and more than 10 percent of America's gross domestic product.
Today those figures are not quite as troubling. While military spending as a percentage of gross domestic product has been going up as a result of 9/11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the overall trend since 1961 is substantially down, thanks to the tremendous growth in America's nonmilitary economy and the shift in government spending to nonmilitary expenditures.
Yet spending numbers do not tell the whole story. Eisenhower warned that the influence of the military-industrial complex was ''economic, political, even spiritual'' and that it was ''felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government.'' He exhorted Americans to break away from our reliance on military might as a guarantor of liberty and ''use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.''
On this score, Eisenhower may well have seen today's America as losing the battle against the darker aspects of the military-industrial complex. He was no pacifist, but he was a lifelong opponent of what he called a ''garrison state,'' in which policy and rights are defined by the shadowy needs of an all-powerful military elite.
The United States isn't quite a garrison state today. But Eisenhower would likely have been deeply troubled, in the past decade, by the torture at Abu Ghraib, the use of martial authority to wiretap Americans without warrants and the multiyear detention of suspects at Guantanamo Bay without due process.
Finally, even if the economy can bear the immediate costs of the military, Eisenhower would be shocked at its mounting long-term costs. Most of the Iraq war expenses were paid for by borrowing, and Americans will shoulder those costs, plus interest, for many years to come.
A strong believer in a balanced budget, Eisenhower in his farewell address also told Americans to ''avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow.'' Too many of today's so-called fiscal conservatives conveniently overlook the budgetary consequences of military spending.
Eisenhower's worst fears have not yet come to pass. But his warning against the ''unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex'' is as urgent today as ever.

HEADLINE: College, Jobs and Inequality

 BODY:
Searching for solace in bleak unemployment numbers, policy makers and commentators often cite the relatively low joblessness among college graduates, which is currently 5.1 percent compared with 10 percent for high school graduates and an overall jobless rate of 9.8 percent. Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, cited the data recently on ''60 Minutes'' to make the point that ''educational differences'' are a root cause of income inequality.
A college education is better than no college education and correlates with higher pay. But as a cure for unemployment or as a way to narrow the chasm between the rich and everyone else, ''more college'' is a too-easy answer. Over the past year, for example, the unemployment rate for college grads under age 25 has averaged 9.2 percent, up from 8.8 percent a year earlier and 5.8 percent in the first year of the recession that began in December 2007. That means recent grads have about the same level of unemployment as the general population. It also suggests that many employed recent grads may be doing work that doesn't require a college degree. 
Even more disturbing, there is no guarantee that unemployed or underemployed college grads will move into much better jobs as conditions improve. Early bouts of joblessness, or starting in a lower-level job with lower pay, can mean lower levels of career attainment and earnings over a lifetime.Graduates who have been out of work or underemployed in the downturn may also find themselves at a competitive disadvantage with freshly minted college graduates as the economy improves.
When it comes to income inequality, college-educated workers make more than noncollege-educated ones. But higher pay for college grads cannot explain the profound inequality in the United States. The latest installment of the groundbreaking work on income inequality by the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez shows that the richest 1 percent of American households -- those making more than $370,000 a year -- received 21 percent of total income in 2008. That was slightly below the highs of the bubble years but still among the highest percentages since the Roaring Twenties.
The top 10 percent -- those making more than $110,000 -- received 48 percent of total income, leaving 52 percent for the bottom 90 percent. Where are college-educated workers? Their median pay has basically stagnated for the past 10 years, at roughly $72,000 a year for men and $52,000 a year for women.
A big reason for the huge gains at the top is the outsize pay of executives, bankers and traders. Lower on the income ladder, workers have not fared well, in part because health care has consumed an ever-larger share of compensation and bargaining power has diminished with the decline in labor unions.
College is still the path to higher-paying professions. But without a concerted effort to develop new industries, the weakened economy will be hard pressed to create enough better-paid positions to absorb all graduates.
And to combat inequality, the drive for more college and more jobs must coincide with efforts to preserve and improve the policies, programs and institutions that have fostered shared prosperity and broad opportunity -- Social Security, Medicare, public schools, progressive taxation, unions, affirmative action, regulation of financial markets and enforcement of labor laws.
College is not a cure-all, but it will certainly take the best and brightest minds to confront those challenges.

HEADLINE: U.S. Afghan Role Questioned As Relief Worker Deaths Soar

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- At least 100 relief workers in Afghanistan have been killed so far this year, far more than in any previous year, prompting a debate within humanitarian organizations about whether American military strategy is putting them and the Afghans they serve at unnecessary risk.
Most of the victims worked for aid contractors employed by NATO countries, with fewer victims among traditional nonprofit aid groups.
The difference in the body counts of the two groups is at the heart of a question troubling the aid community: Has American counterinsurgency strategy militarized the delivery of aid?
That doctrine calls for making civilian development aid a major adjunct to the military push. To do that there are Provincial Reconstruction Teams in 33 of 34 provinces, staffed by civilians from coalition countries to deliver aid projects. The effort is enormous, dominated by the Americans; the United States Agency for International Development alone is spending $4 billion this year, most of it through the teams. 
The so-called P.R.T.'s work from heavily guarded military compounds and are generally escorted by troops from the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.
Traditional aid workers worry that the P.R.T.'s and the development companies working for them are compromising their neutrality. Oxfam and 28 other charitable groups signed a report last month, ''Nowhere to Turn,'' that denounces the practice, saying it puts civilians at greater risk.
''In many instances, where P.R.T. projects have been implemented in insecure areas in an effort to win 'hearts and minds,' they put individuals and communities at risk,'' the Oxfam report said.
Michiel Hofman, the head of Doctors Without Borders in Afghanistan, said, ''This assistance forces the beneficiaries to choose sides, and many people in the disputed areas do not want to choose sides.''
The military and its NATO civilian partners disagree. Earl Gast, the mission director for U.S.A.I.D. in Afghanistan, said the United Nations and the International Security Assistance Force had agreed on a clear distinction and clear rules regarding humanitarian aid -- ''that it can't be militarized and it can't be politicized.''
''Those are rules that we follow,'' Mr. Gast said.
Part of the problem is the definition of humanitarian aid. Traditionally it means life-saving emergency assistance, but the distinction is often unclear. Providing medical care for disaster victims, for instance, is clearly humanitarian, but building a medical clinic for war victims could be considered either humanitarian or developmental aid, properly within the scope of the civil-military effort.
Further complicating matters, many traditional relief groups have expanded their efforts into development work, although they take pains to ensure that their projects are not connected to the government or the military.
But the military and its supporters say traditional aid groups have neither the capacity nor the willingness to bring large-scale aid programs to conflict areas. This has resulted in a reliance on private development companies, most of them profit-making, to deliver the aid programs paid for by NATO countries.
''Someone has to go into the areas where the war is being fought,'' Mr. Gast said. ''We recognize that some N.G.O.'s don't have the capacity and some of them don't want to, but there are other willing partners who can go,'' he said, using the abbreviation for nongovernmental organizations.
A Dec. 1 report by Refugees International was highly critical. ''U.S.A.I.D.'s use of development contractors and frequent embeds with the military have dangerously blurred humanitarian principles by associating such programs with a party to the conflict,'' the group wrote.
Among the contracted aid groups working for coalition government programs, which nearly always employ armed guards and work in fortified compounds or from military bases, the body count has been particularly severe. Eighty aid contractors employed by the United States Agency for International Development were killed and 220 wounded from January through early November of this year. (In the same period, 410 American soldiers and Marines died.)
The aid contractors were attacked on average 55 times a month -- a sevenfold increase over 2009, Mr. Gast said. By contrast, 20 people employed by charitable and humanitarian groups, which refuse to use armed guards or work with the military, were killed during the first nine months of this year.
Sixty-four charitable aid workers were kidnapped by insurgents this year. All were released unharmed, usually after negotiations involving local community leaders who vouched for them, according to the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office.
One U.S.A.I.D. contractor who was kidnapped, Linda Norgrove, was killed during a botched rescue attempt by American Special Forces troops.
The military and its supporters say the difference in body counts only reflects the fact that the aid contractors work in dangerous areas where many nongovernmental organizations are unwilling to operate.
Nongovernmental organizations vigorously disagree. ''We are in 26 provinces,'' said Ashley Jackson of Oxfam, ''and in Arghandab there are four N.G.O.'s working on health care and education.'' Arghandab is one of the most dangerous areas in Kandahar, with a district-level team from the Provincial Reconstruction Team running more than 50 aid projects. ''The P.R.T.'s' presence makes it more dangerous to work there,'' Ms. Jackson said.
NATO officials contend that insurgents do not distinguish between aid workers. ''Insurgents have made clear both in their rhetoric and their actions that they target N.G.O.'s and aid workers,'' said Mark Jacobson, the deputy senior civilian representative of NATO in Afghanistan.
But aid officials counter that the very difference in casualties between private contractors and charitable ones shows that the Taliban do make a distinction.
''It's quite easy,'' said Mr. Hofman of Doctors Without Borders. ''We don't use armed guards, we don't have barbed wire on our gates, there's a clear logo on our cars, and we are not associated with any program strengthening government. The government is just one of many warring parties.''
Doctors Without Borders has offices in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province, where it runs a hospital. Those offices have never been attacked, while a private development company, International Relief and Development, just down the same street, has a fortified compound that has been attacked by insurgents. In Kunduz, his group has not been attacked, but the company DAI has been.
Many of the traditional aid groups are particularly critical of the United Nations, which they accuse of failing in its responsibility to make sure aid efforts are not militarized. The United Nations recognizes the Afghan government and is politically committed to it, but many of its agencies, including Unicef and the World Food Program, are expected to deliver humanitarian aid.
The conflict inherent in those two roles is typified by Robert Watson, who is both the deputy special representative of the secretary general, a political role, and the head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Kabul.
Mr. Watson agrees that the lines are often blurred. ''It makes it difficult for us in the humanitarian community to demonstrate to those on the other side of the conflict that we strive to be neutral intermediaries,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Room Is Booked, Until the Hotel Says It Isn't

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When is a confirmed hotel reservation not confirmed? When the hotel has sold your room to someone else, as Linda and Michael Morgan learned over the Thanksgiving holiday.
The hotel, in this case, was the Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan, and according to Mrs. Morgan and some other would-be guests who were turned away over Thanksgiving, the ''someone else'' was a contingent of Saudi princes and officials who accompanied King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. The king, who is 86 years old, was in town for surgery at New York Presbyterian Hospital on Nov. 24.
The Morgans had planned for a festive family gathering in New York, making their reservations last summer for four rooms, including three suites, starting two days before Thanksgiving, on Nov. 23. Mrs. Morgan, who lives in Seattle, said that she and her husband learned only by chance that the rooms were not available when her husband called to make a last-minute change. 
''My husband called to cancel one room after my mother decided not to travel. That was when he was told that none of the rooms was available,'' she said. ''If he hadn't called, we would have all shown up at the Waldorf and effectively gotten kicked out.''
Reluctantly, the Morgans accepted the Waldorf's offer of alternate accommodations, including a free night's stay, at the nearby Hilton New York. But the world-famous Waldorf was supposed to be the highlight of the trip, she said. ''They assured us the Hilton was just as nice, but come on, there were people in the elevators at the Hilton carrying pizza boxes.''
Though the Waldorf's parent company, Hilton Worldwide, won't confirm or deny the arrival of a large number of Saudi guests, the Morgans and others who complained all said they had been told that the Waldorf turned away more than 100 guests because a Saudi contingent unexpectedly claimed a large number of rooms.
The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Park Avenue, which opened in 1931, has long been favored by visiting celebrities and political dignitaries, including foreign parties -- partly because it offers excellent physical security.
King Abdullah arrived in New York on Nov. 23. The New York Post reported that the king and his large entourage had flown to New York in three chartered airliners, and drove into Manhattan from the airport in a convoy of 40 vehicles. The Post reported that the king's staff then ''commandeered'' the V.I.P. floor at the hospital.
In news releases, the Saudi government named seven Saudi princes who accompanied King Abdullah on his visit, each of whom would have traveled with personal entourages and security staff. Other Saudi officials came along, too. Evidently, the Waldorf-Astoria did not fully anticipate the size of the contingent.
Hilton Worldwide, citing policies on guest privacy, declined to answer my questions. Instead, in a brief statement, Hilton said, ''On those occasions when a guest relocation occurs, it is always our intention and goal to ensure that the affected individual is totally satisfied'' and offered ''comparable accommodations'' at another hotel.
The practice of providing alternative accommodations when a hotel is overbooked is called ''walking'' in the hotel industry.
Mrs. Morgan and several others who were ''walked'' to the Hilton on Thanksgiving week posted complaints about their treatment on the hotel reviews section of TripAdvisor.com.
Popular hotels often overbook, on the assumption that a certain number of reservations will be canceled at the last minute. And overbooking is likely to become more of an issue as the travel industry rebounds from the slump brought on by the recession. Smith Travel Research recently estimated that overall hotel demand in the United States was higher than it had earlier forecast, and would rise 7.4 percent this year over 2009.
In New York, famous hotels like the Waldorf are always heavily booked during holidays. Given a sudden demand for rooms from prominent customers like a valued foreign delegation, a hotel like the Waldorf can face a tough choice: accommodate individual guests who may have booked at discount rates that were widely available last summer (as the Morgans did), or accommodate the last-minute, high-yield group that will pay a premium that, in the case of the Waldorf, can account for what one industry expert estimated at $80,000 to $100,000 in daily revenue.
While the situation at the Waldorf was unusual, research by TripAdvisor indicates that 30 percent of travelers have been bumped from a hotel at some point, despite having confirmed reservations, Brooke Ferencsik, a spokesman, said.
So what to do if you're one of the unlucky ones? ''The best advice is to routinely call a hotel before you arrive, just to double-check,'' Mr. Ferencsik said.
Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, said that a phone call to confirm was prudent in cities like New York during peak seasons. If you're told that your reservation has been canceled, make an ''unemotional'' appeal, citing matters like a crucial breakfast meeting scheduled at the hotel, he said. And if appeals to the desk clerk fail, he said, ''escalate and ask to see the front-office manager or general manager.''
Mrs. Morgan sent me copies of the family's reservation confirmations and subsequent correspondence with hotel management. She was the only person who posted complaints on TripAdvisor whom I could reach by phone.
But other would-be Waldorf guests offered similar stories. A woman from Oregon wrote: ''When we got to the Waldorf-Astoria we were informed that our room was not available due to a large party that extended their stay. We were not informed of this prior to arriving.''
Mrs. Morgan said she and her husband were unhappy with how the Waldorf handled things. ''We've stayed at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York every November for about 30 years'' on both business and leisure trips, she said. ''In fact, we'd stayed there earlier in November, less than two weeks before they turned us away. Is that any way to reward loyalty?''

HEADLINE: A Contrarian at the Fed

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- All year, Thomas M. Hoenig has been saying no.
As the lone dissenter on the Federal Reserve committee that sets interest rates, Mr. Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, has been a persistent skeptic of just about everything the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has done to try to stimulate the flagging recovery.
Mr. Hoenig's latest, loudest objections, aimed at the Fed's risky $600 billion infusion into the markets to reinvigorate the economy, have made him a champion of the Fed's critics in Congress, on Wall Street and among business leaders, who, like Mr. Hoenig, fear that the central bank is risking runaway inflation, asset bubbles and a weakened dollar.
At 64, Mr. Hoenig has witnessed jolts in the nation's economic history that make him deeply skeptical of short-term fixes. He says he believes the Fed's tools for fixing the economy in the short run are limited and the potential for things to go disastrously wrong is very high. 
If it were up to him, he would keep interest rates very low, but would not promise to keep them at essentially zero for ''an extended period,'' as the Fed has announced. He says he thinks that trying to lower long-term rates, as the Fed is doing by buying bonds, is a mistake. The recovery, however slow and painful, he says, cannot be hurried.
As the longest-serving regional Fed president, his views are shaped by the uncontrolled inflation of the 1970s, the spike in land prices that followed and the ensuing banking and thrift crises.
To him, Mr. Bernanke's plan is ''a dangerous gamble'' and ''a bargain with the devil,'' strong words that have rankled some officials of the Fed, where dissent is tolerated but not celebrated.
In an interview on Dec. 6 in his office here, he did not appear to relish going against the grain, but lately he has not been running from the spotlight. ''It's never easy to disagree against a majority,'' he said. ''It's hard. It's not something that I take lightly.
''Some people think I should be more part of the group,'' Mr. Hoenig said. ''I'm not a group person.''
A month after the Fed announced its intentions to buy bonds and push down interest rates, investors have done the opposite by driving up long-term rates, hardly a help to a sputtering recovery.
Mr. Hoenig, who is likely to vote no again on Tuesday when the committee meets for the last time this year, said it was too early to say whether the market reaction and the uncertainty had vindicated his position.
''I don't want to say that I'm right and someone else is wrong,'' he said. ''Only time will tell whether I'm correct.''
The son of a Midwestern plumbing contractor, Mr. Hoenig (pronounced ''HAWN-ig'') spent his career at the Kansas City Fed. He is cautious, courtly and hardly a partisan, though he recently addressed Congressional Republicans at their invitation. In his unwavering dissents, seven this year, and in his wariness of Wall Street, his views seem rooted in the agrarian and populist tradition that is mistrustful of concentrations of power.
He has called for breaking up giant Wall Street banks and severely restricting their trading activities, a stance that has endeared him to some liberals. He is commonly characterized as an inflation hawk, a label Mr. Hoenig rejects as overly simplistic. If he is hawkish on anything, he says, it is financial stability.
''I don't like having unemployment at 9.8 percent,'' he added. ''It's just unacceptable.'' He concedes, however, there is not much the Fed can do about it.
As a young economist, he witnessed the rampant inflation of the 1970s, which was curbed only after Paul A. Volcker became Fed chairman in 1979 and promptly raised interest rates to double-digit levels, setting off two painful recessions. The strong medicine worked; inflation has been largely under control since 1982.
During the 1980s, Mr. Hoenig worked in bank supervision and regulation at the Kansas City Fed, where an agricultural crisis and land bubble prompted a string of bank failures. Those included the collapse of Penn Square Bank in Oklahoma City in 1982, Mr. Hoenig's first experience managing a crisis, and later the Continental Illinois insolvency, then the nation's largest bank failure.
Mr. Hoenig said he believed the Fed had not always learned from its mistakes. By keeping interest rates too low for too long, in his view, the Fed contributed to the dot-com bubble that burst in 2001 and the even bigger housing bubble that popped in 2007. (Before this year, Mr. Hoenig had dissented four times, in July 1995, May and December 2001 and October 2007, all in opposition to lowering short-term interest rates.)
''It is my concern that, by understandably wanting to see things move more quickly, we create the conditions for repeating the mistakes of the past,'' he said.
Mr. Hoenig's mantra is that monetary policy works with ''long and variable lags,'' meaning that the consequences of today's policies may not be felt until much later. By keeping short-term interest rates near zero, as the Fed has done since December 2008 -- and which he supports but not indefinitely -- the central bank is increasing the risk of inflation and instability down the road, he says.
But most Fed officials say they believe that Mr. Hoenig's worries are exaggerated. In a televised interview this month, Mr. Bernanke said he was ''100 percent'' confident of the Fed's ability to tighten monetary policy and raise interest rates when the time came, and called fears of inflation ''way overstated.''
Other economists say Mr. Hoenig's viewpoint has seemed inflexible.
''I find it hard to understand why Hoenig is still worried about inflation when the obvious trend is downward, toward lower inflation with a risk of deflation,'' said Joseph E. Gagnon, a former Fed economist who is at the Peterson Institution for International Economics in Washington.
Mr. Hoenig's contrarian disposition partly reflects his Midwest upbringing, far from the Wall Street-Washington axis of influence.
The second of seven children, Mr. Hoenig grew up in Fort Madison, Iowa. He attended a small college in Kansas, was drafted into the Army and served a year in an artillery unit in Vietnam, then received a Ph.D. in economics at Iowa State. He joined the Kansas City Fed in 1973 and became president in 1991.
Lu M. Cordova, the chairwoman of the Kansas City Fed's board, said Mr. Hoenig did not seek attention. Indeed, he sought the board's guidance before he delivered a March 2009 speech, ''Too Big Has Failed,'' which received widespread notice. ''He really agonized about whether to speak out or not,'' she said.
Even critics of Mr. Hoenig acknowledge he has been prescient.
In a speech in 1999, shortly after Congress repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that separated investment banking from commercial banking, he warned that ''in a world dominated by mega-financial institutions, governments could be reluctant to close those that become troubled for fear of systemic effects on the financial system.''
Sure enough, in 2008, the Fed helped sell Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase, rescued the American International Group and, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, bailed out the financial system.
The crisis has only made the biggest banks even bigger. ''They have enormous power,'' Mr. Hoenig said. ''Just look at their lobbying expenses. I use the word -- and it's a fairly flammable word -- oligarchy. These things are huge and powerful, and that's where the money is. This country through its history has abhorred concentration of financial power, and for good reason.''
Tuesday's Fed vote will be Mr. Hoenig's last, because the presidents of the Fed's regional banks, other than New York, share votes under a rotation system. Mr. Hoenig does not have a vote next year, and he must retire after he turns 65 in September. As for his future, Mr. Hoenig, a train enthusiast who reads biography and history in his spare time, is certain that he will not follow other Fed veterans who have gone to work on Wall Street. ''I can tell you one thing,'' he said. ''I'll never work for a too-big-to-fail bank.''

HEADLINE: Tax Breaks Bring Hope For Hiring

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
To many manufacturing companies, the tax cut proposal now being considered in Washington may be just enough to spur additional spending and hiring.
At Yushin America, a Rhode Island company that makes and maintains robotic manufacturing equipment, executives say that the business tax breaks would allow them to invest in new machinery, new employees and even a new roof.
''It's a chance for us to put it back in the business and grow,'' said Michael Greenhalgh, operations manager of the company in Cranston, which employs 60 people and has annual sales of about $21 million. 
Tax cuts intended for businesses are a relatively small part of the $858 billion tax bill scheduled for a final vote in the Senate as early as Tuesday.
The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that about $75 billion of the tax breaks in the plan were aimed at businesses, including $13 billion for a two-year extension of the coveted research and development credit, which helps cover the cost of wages for employees involved in research. The proposal also commits $22 billion for accelerated depreciation, which in 2011 would allow businesses to write off 100 percent of their capital expenditures immediately instead of over several years.
Many economists are skeptical of the tax breaks' potential to stoke the economy in any meaningful way. Businesses are sitting on more than a trillion in cash, but are reluctant to invest because of lagging demand, a problem that tax incentives are not devised to address.
''The research and development credit is a good thing, with a limited effect, and the accelerated depreciation will get people to move forward with investment that they probably would have done anyway,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's. ''But when you look at the amount of money involved, you're not getting a lot of bang for your buck.''
But the Obama administration says it believes that the measure will help the economy gather strength and the recovery grow more robust. The president has asked a group of top business executives to meet with him on Wednesday, when he hopes to rally their support for the tax proposal and to formulate a new strategy for creating jobs and reviving the economy.
''Based on past experience with similar tax incentive programs, the Treasury estimates that the 100 percent expensing provision in the bill could support $50 billion in new investment, while other outside estimates have projected an even larger impact,'' said Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman.
Through much of the summer and fall, Republicans warned that President Obama's call to let the Bush-era tax cuts expire for the top 2 percent of earners -- individuals with incomes above $200,000 and families making more than $250,000 -- would harm small businesses. The income of many business owners is taxed at individual rates. Democrats countered that only 3 percent of all businesses made enough to be affected, but Mr. Obama conceded.
In addition, Congress has added more than $50 billion to extend an assortment of business tax breaks to benefit a variety of industries -- including the renewable energy, ethanol, computer and publishing companies and oil drillers.
Some businesses say that the tax breaks are little more than a giveaway, intended to win support of Republicans in Congress and salve the president's strained relations with business leaders. Dennis Mehiel, chairman of U.S. Corrugated Inc., was one of dozens of millionaires who wrote to Mr. Obama asking that he raise the top tax rates on the wealthy. While Mr. Mehiel says he thinks that the research and development and depreciation breaks will help some businesses, he fears that the overall package is a poor use of public money.
''I have no belief that hiring, business expansion decisions, investment decisions will be materially impacted by maintaining the somewhat lower tax rates,'' said Mr. Mehiel, whose company employs 2,500 people at 20 package manufacturing facilities.
To many manufacturing companies, however, the tax deal has the effect of both reducing their own burdens and increasing orders from other businesses that will have incentive to buy equipment and supplies.
''These are catalysts for job creation,'' said Monica McGuire, a policy analyst at the National Association of Manufacturers.
At Yushin, company officials say the various tax provisions will allow the robotics company to hire at least four engineers, in addition to spending $95,000 to fix a leaky roof and $90,000 more to replace outdated air-conditioning units.
Company officials at Bison Gear and Engineering, a manufacturer of electric motors in the Chicago area, said the tax savings would help them expand their payroll.
Because Bison is organized as a subchapter S corporation, and its income is taxed at its owners' individual rate, it will benefit if Congress extends the tax break for the wealthy. The company, which has $50 million in sales and 225 employees, will also reap tax savings from the changes in depreciation and research policies.
Ron Bullock, company chairman, said three positions in the research and development staff had been vacant for months as he tried to gauge the strength of the economic recovery and the prospects of a double-dip recession. With the tax savings, Mr. Bullock said, he expects to hire as well as replace aging equipment.
''Other businesses will use their tax incentives to order products from us, which will allow us to hire and, hopefully, expand,'' he said. ''That's the way you turn an economy around, and allay the fears people have about whether this economy is a good place to invest.''

PERSON: Richard C. Holbrooke 

HEADLINE: Strong American Voice in Diplomacy and Crisis

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN; David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan since 2009 and a diplomatic troubleshooter who worked for every Democratic president since the late 1960s and oversaw the negotiations that ended the war in Bosnia, died Monday evening in Washington. He was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
His death was confirmed by an Obama administration official.
Mr. Holbrooke was hospitalized on Friday afternoon after becoming ill while meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in her Washington office. Doctors found a tear to his aorta, and he underwent a 21-hour operation. Mr. Holbrooke had additional surgery on Sunday and remained in very critical condition until his death. 
Mr. Holbrooke's signal accomplishment in a distinguished career that involved diplomacy in Asia, Europe and the Middle East was his role as chief architect of the 1995 Dayton peace accords, which ended the war in Bosnia. It was a coup preceded and followed by his peacekeeping missions to the tinderbox of ethnic, religious and regional conflicts that was formerly Yugoslavia.
More recently, Mr. Holbrooke wrestled with the stunning complexity of Afghanistan and Pakistan: how to bring stability to the region while fighting a resurgent Taliban and coping with corrupt governments, rigged elections, fragile economies, a rampant narcotics trade, nuclear weapons in Pakistan, and the presence of Al Qaeda, and presumably Osama bin Laden, in the wild tribal borderlands.
One of his main tasks was to press President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan to take responsibility for security in his country and to confront the corruption that imperils the American mission there. At times, Mr. Karzai refused to see him, but Mr. Holbrooke was undeterred.
''He's an enormously tough customer,'' Mr. Holbrooke said during one of the periodic breakfasts he had with reporters who covered his diplomatic exploits. ''As you've heard,'' he added with a smile, ''so am I.''
He helped his boss, Mrs. Clinton, whom he had supported in her presidential bid, to persuade President Obama to send more troops to Afghanistan, while pressing for more aid and development projects to improve the United States' image there. But he died before anyone knew if the experiment would succeed.
A brilliant, sometimes abrasive infighter, he used a formidable arsenal of facts, bluffs, whispers, implied threats and, when necessary, pyrotechnic fits of anger to press his positions. Mr. Obama, who praised Mr. Holbrooke on Monday afternoon at the State Department as ''simply one of the giants of American foreign policy,'' was sometimes driven to distraction by his lectures.
But Mr. Holbrooke dazzled and often intimidated opponents and colleagues around a negotiating table. Some called him a bully, and he looked the part: the big chin thrust out, the broad shoulders, the tight smile that might mean anything. To admirers, however, including generations of State Department proteges and the presidents he served, his peacemaking efforts were extraordinary.
When he named Mr. Holbrooke to represent the United States at the United Nations, President Bill Clinton said, ''His remarkable diplomacy in Bosnia helped to stop the bloodshed, and at the talks in Dayton the force of his determination was the key to securing peace, restoring hope and saving lives.'' Others said his work in Bosnia deserved the Nobel Peace Prize.
Few diplomats could boast of his career accomplishments. Early on, Mr. Holbrooke devoted six years to the Vietnam War: first in the Mekong Delta with the United States Agency for International Development, seeking the allegiance of the civilian population; then at the embassy in Saigon as an aide to Ambassadors Maxwell Taylor and Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.; and finally in the American delegation to the 1968-69 Paris peace talks led by W. Averell Harriman and Cyrus R. Vance.
Mr. Holbrooke was the author of one volume of the Pentagon Papers, the secret Defense Department history of the Vietnam War that cataloged years of American duplicity in Southeast Asia. The papers were first brought to public attention by The New York Times in 1971.
As assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs in the Carter administration, Mr. Holbrooke played a crucial role in establishing full diplomatic relations with China in 1979, a move that finessed America's continuing commitment to China's thorn in the side Taiwan and followed up on the historic breakthrough of President Richard M. Nixon's 1972 visit to China.
During the Clinton presidency, Mr. Holbrooke served as ambassador to Germany in 1993-94, when he helped enlarge the North Atlantic alliance; achieved his diplomatic breakthroughs in Bosnia as assistant secretary of state for European affairs in 1994-95; and was chief representative to the United Nations, a cabinet post, for 17 months from 1999 to 2001.
At the United Nations, he forged close ties to Secretary General Kofi Annan, negotiated a settlement of America's longstanding dues dispute, highlighted conflicts and health crises in Africa and Indonesia, and called for more peacekeeping forces. After fighting erupted in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1999, he led a Security Council delegation on a mission to Africa. He also backed sanctions against Angolan rebels in 2000.
While he achieved prominence as a cabinet official and envoy to many of the world's most troubled arenas, Mr. Holbrooke was frustrated in his ambition to be secretary of state; he was the runner-up to Madeleine K. Albright, Mr. Clinton's choice in 1997, and a contender when Mr. Obama installed Mrs. Clinton in the post in 2009.
Foreign policy was his life. Even during Republican administrations, when he was not in government, he was deeply engaged, undertaking missions as a private citizen traveling through the war-weary Balkans and the backwaters of Africa and Asia to see firsthand the damage and devastating human costs of genocide, civil wars, and H.I.V. and AIDS epidemics.
And his voice on the outside remained influential -- as an editor of Foreign Policy magazine from 1972 to 1977, as a writer of columns for The Washington Post and analytical articles for many other publications, and as the author of two books. He collaborated with Clark Clifford, a presidential adviser, on a best-selling Clifford memoir, ''Counsel to the President'' (1991), and wrote his own widely acclaimed memoir, ''To End a War'' (1998), about his Bosnia service.
Mr. Holbrooke also made millions as an investment banker on Wall Street. In the early 1980s, he was a co-founder of a Washington consulting firm, Public Strategies, which was later sold to Lehman Brothers. At various times he was a managing director of Lehman Brothers, vice chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston and a director of the American International Group.
Richard Charles Albert Holbrooke was born in Manhattan on April 24, 1941, to Dr. Dan Holbrooke, a physician, and the former Trudi Moos. He attended Scarsdale High School, where his best friend was David Rusk, son of Dean Rusk, the future secretary of state. Richard's father died when he was 15, and he drew closer to the Rusk family.
At Brown University, he majored in history and was editor of the student newspaper. He intended to become a journalist, but after graduating in 1962 he was turned down by The Times and joined the State Department as a foreign service officer.
In 1964, Mr. Holbrooke married the first of his three wives, Larrine Sullivan, a lawyer. The couple had two sons, David and Anthony, and were divorced. His marriage to Blythe Babyak, a television producer, also ended in divorce. In 1995, he married Kati Marton, an author, journalist and human rights advocate who had been married to the ABC anchorman Peter Jennings until their divorce in 1993. He is survived by Ms. Marton; his two sons; his brother, Andrew; and two stepchildren, Christopher and Elizabeth Jennings.
After language training, he spent three years working in Vietnam. In 1966, he joined President Lyndon B. Johnson's White House staff, and two years later became a junior member of the delegation at the Paris peace talks. The talks achieved no breakthrough, but the experience taught him much about the arts of negotiation.
In 1970, after a year as a fellow at Princeton, he became director of the Peace Corps in Morocco. He quit government service in 1972 and over the next five years edited the quarterly journal Foreign Policy. He was also a contributing editor of Newsweek International and a consultant on reorganizing the government's foreign policy apparatus.
He worked on Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign in 1976, and was rewarded with the post of assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs. When Ronald Reagan and the Republicans took over the White House in 1981, Mr. Holbrooke left the government and for more than a decade focused on writing and investment banking.
When President Clinton took office in 1993, Mr. Holbrooke was named ambassador to Germany. He helped found the American Academy in Berlin as a cultural exchange center.
He returned to Washington in 1994 as assistant secretary of state for European affairs. His top priority soon became the horrendous civil war in the former Yugoslavia, a conflict precipitated by the secession of Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia and Bosnia. Massacres, mass rapes and displaced populations, among other atrocities, were part of campaigns of ''ethnic cleansing'' against Muslims.
After months of shuttle diplomacy, Mr. Holbrooke in 1995 achieved a breakthrough cease-fire and a framework for dividing Bosnia into two entities, one of Bosnian Serbs and another of Croatians and Muslims. The endgame negotiations, involving the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, unfolded in Dayton, Ohio, where a peace agreement was reached after months of hard bargaining led by Mr. Holbrooke.
It was the high-water mark of a career punctuated with awards, honorary degrees and prestigious seats on the boards of the Asia Society, the American Museum of Natural History, the National Endowment for Democracy, the Council on Foreign Relations, Refugees International and other organizations. He was 59 when he left the United Nations as the Clinton administration drew to a close.
But there was to be one more task. As Mr. Obama assumed office and attention shifted to Afghanistan, Mr. Holbrooke took on his last assignment. He began by trying to lower expectations, moving away from the grand, transformative goals of President George W. Bush toward something more readily achievable.
But his boss and old friend, Mrs. Clinton, expressed absolute confidence in him. ''Richard represents the kind of robust, persistent, determined diplomacy the president intends to pursue,'' she said. ''I admire deeply his ability to shoulder the most vexing and difficult challenges.''

HEADLINE: The Latest Health Care Decision

 BODY:
It was no great surprise that a federal district judge in Virginia, nominated by President George W. Bush, declared a provision of the health care reform law unconstitutional. Yet his decision offers at least some hope for health care reform because it bends over backward to limit the scope of his ruling in two important respects. 
The core of his ruling is that a requirement in the law that people buy health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty is unconstitutional because it exceeds Congressional powers to regulate interstate commerce or to impose taxes for the general welfare. Two other district court judges nominated by President Bill Clinton -- in Michigan and in another part of Virginia -- have ruled the mandate constitutional.
Judge Henry Hudson concluded that Congress can't regulate ''economic inactivity,'' the failure to buy health insurance, as if it were ''economic activity'' that affected interstate commerce. Yet it seems clear that decisions not to buy insurance will, in the aggregate, affect costs in the broader health care markets. We hope higher courts will find that a decision to forgo insurance simply shifts much of the cost for subsequent illness to hospitals, doctors and insured individuals. Taxpayers' costs would rise to pay for billions of dollars in uncompensated care given to individuals who can't pay for it.
Judge Hudson also ruled that the penalties for failing to buy insurance, though administered through the Internal Revenue Service, were really a penalty not a tax and thus can't be justified by Congress's authority to raise taxes for the general welfare. Yet there are precedents that seem to suggest that penalties can be considered taxes if they raise some revenue.
Virginia's attorney general had asked the judge to invalidate the entire law if he found the mandate to buy insurance unconstitutional, but Judge Hudson invalidated only the mandate. He said he was following a time-honored rule to ''sever with circumspection'' by removing only problematic parts of a law.
The attorney general had also asked the judge to stop implementation of the law until a higher court rules on its constitutionality. Judge Hudson sensibly denied that request in part because the crucial provisions of the mandate, the only issue he was addressing, don't take effect until 2013. Preparatory steps are not irreversible and states should not hang back while this case is being appealed and likely decided by the Supreme Court.

HEADLINE: CORE OF HEALTH CARE LAW IS REJECTED BY A U.S. JUDGE

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
A federal judge in Virginia ruled on Monday that the keystone provision in the Obama health care law is unconstitutional, becoming the first judge to invalidate any part of the sprawling act and ensuring that appellate courts will receive contradictory opinions from below.
The judge, Henry E. Hudson of Federal District Court in Richmond, said the law's requirement that most Americans obtain insurance exceeded the regulatory authority granted to Congress under the Commerce Clause.
Judge Hudson, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, declined the plaintiff's request to suspend the act's implementation pending appeal, meaning there should be no immediate effect on its rollout.
But the ruling seemed likely to create confusion among the public and to further destabilize political support for a law that is under fierce attack from Republicans in Congress and in many statehouses. Party leaders, including the incoming House speaker, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, quickly used the opinion to reiterate their call for repealing the law. 
In a 42-page opinion, Judge Hudson wrote: ''Neither the Supreme Court nor any federal circuit court of appeals has extended Commerce Clause powers to compel an individual to involuntarily enter the stream of commerce by purchasing a commodity in the private market.''
Allowing Congress to exert such authority, he said, ''would invite unbridled exercise of federal police powers.''
Compelling vehicle owners to carry accident insurance, as states do, is considered a different matter because the Constitution gives the states broad police powers that have been interpreted to encompass that. Furthermore, there is no statutory requirement that people possess cars, only a requirement that they have insurance as a condition of doing so. By contrast, the plaintiffs in the health care case argue that the new law requires people to obtain health insurance simply because they exist.
The insurance mandate is central to the law's mission of covering more than 30 million people who are uninsured. Insurers argue that only by requiring healthy people to have policies can they afford to pay for those with expensive conditions. But Judge Hudson ruled that many of the law's other provisions could be severed legally and would survive even if the mandate is invalidated.
Judge Hudson is the third district court judge to reach a determination on the merits in one of the two dozen lawsuits challenging the health care law. The other judges, in Detroit and Lynchburg, Va., have upheld the law. Lawyers say the appellate process could last another two years before the Supreme Court settles the dispute.
The opinion by Judge Hudson, who has a long history in Republican politics in Northern Virginia, continued a partisan pattern in the health care cases. Thus far, judges appointed by Republican presidents have ruled consistently against the Obama administration, while Democratic appointees have found for it.
That has reinforced the notion -- fueled by the White House -- that the lawsuits are as much a political assault as a constitutional one. The Richmond case was filed by Virginia's attorney general, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, a Republican, and all but one of the 20 attorneys general and governors who filed a similar case in Pensacola, Fla., are Republicans.
The two cases previously decided by district courts are already before the midlevel courts of appeal, with the Detroit case in the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati and the Lynchburg case in the Fourth Circuit in Richmond.
The Justice Department, which is defending the statute, is considering whether to appeal Judge Hudson's ruling to the Fourth Circuit, which hears cases from Virginia and four other states. That would leave that court to consider opposite rulings handed down over two weeks in courthouses situated only 116 miles apart.
Administration officials emphasized that Judge Hudson's opinion was just one among several and said they were pleased he had not stopped the law from going into effect.
''We are disappointed in today's ruling,'' said Tracy Schmaler, a Justice Department spokeswoman, ''but continue to believe -- as other federal courts in Virginia and Michigan have found -- that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional.''
Ms. Schmaler added, ''We are confident that we will ultimately prevail.''
The administration acknowledges that if the insurance requirement falls before taking effect in 2014, related changes would necessarily collapse with it, most notably provisions that would prevent insurers from denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions or charging them discriminatory rates.
But officials said other innovations, including a vast expansion of Medicaid eligibility and the sale of subsidized insurance policies through state-based exchanges, would withstand even a Supreme Court ruling against the insurance mandate.
Some state officials said Monday's ruling would reinforce calls by many Republican governors and lawmakers to slow down its implementation.
''I think you might see some air taken out of the balloon nationwide,'' said Jason A. Helgerson, the Medicaid director in Wisconsin, where Republicans are about to take control of both the executive and legislative branches.
Judge Hudson, who was previously best known for sentencing the N.F.L. quarterback Michael Vick to 23 months for his involvement in a dog fighting ring, had telegraphed his leanings in a series of hearings and preliminary opinions. But the ruling was nonetheless striking given that only nine months ago, prominent law professors were dismissing the constitutional claims as just north of frivolous.
The case centers on whether Congress can use its powers under the Commerce Clause to compel citizens to buy a commercial product -- namely health insurance -- for the purpose of regulating an interstate economic market. Absent that authority, the administration argued, Congress could use the taxation powers granted by the Constitution to justify the insurance requirement, because the fine for not obtaining coverage will be assessed as an income tax penalty.
While commending Congress's ''laudable intentions,'' Judge Hudson shot down both arguments.
''At its core,'' he wrote, ''this dispute is not simply about regulating the business of insurance -- or crafting a scheme of universal health insurance coverage -- it's about an individual's right to choose to participate.''
The ruling is a political score for Mr. Cuccinelli, who filed the lawsuit on his own rather than joining the Pensacola case. It upstages a major hearing in Florida scheduled for Thursday.
''This case is not about health insurance, it is not about health care,'' Mr. Cuccinelli said at a news conference in Richmond. ''It is about liberty.''
Mr. Cuccinelli, who was elected in 2009, said he had filed on his own because Virginia passed a law this year aimed at nullifying the federal insurance requirement, giving the commonwealth a distinct constitutional claim. Others attribute the strategy to political ambition, suggesting that Mr. Cuccinelli did not want to share the spotlight and knew he could exploit the accelerated pace of judging in Richmond's so-called ''rocket docket'' to raise his profile.
Mr. Cuccinelli filed the lawsuit minutes after President Obama signed the law on March 23 and has been discussing the case on cable television ever since. By late afternoon Monday, he had already posted campaign fund-raising advertisements online that cited his victory.
Even before Monday's ruling, Mr. Cuccinelli and Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, also a Republican, were seeking an agreement with the Justice Department to bypass the United States Circuit Court of Appeals and file for expedited review by the Supreme Court. That would have the effect of further marginalizing the Pensacola case. The Supreme Court rarely takes such requests, and the Justice Department has not publicly expressed an opinion.

HEADLINE: DEALBOOK ONLINE; DAUNTING TASK

BYLINE: By PETER J. HENNING

 BODY:
Recent columns on DealBook by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Jesse Eisinger asked why federal prosecutors have not brought any significant cases against senior corporate executives related to the financial meltdown. A partial answer to the question can be found in a decision issued on Friday by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that reversed the conviction of a financial executive accused of accounting fraud for lack of evidence of any intent to defraud or mislead.
It is easy to assert that there ought to be prosecutions of corporate chieftains -- ''show trials'' like the Soviet Union used to stage -- because of the enormous losses sustained from the meltdown. Actually proving criminal charges is much more difficult, however, if the government has only sketchy evidence of an executive's involvement in questionable decisions and the applicable legal standards are vague, at best.
The appeals court overturned the conviction of Prabhat Goyal, the former chief financial officer of Network Associates, on 15 counts of securities fraud, making false filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and making false statements to the company's auditors. The court concluded that the government simply failed to produce evidence to back up its claims that he intentionally inflated revenue and misled the accountants. 
When an appellate court reverses a conviction, it usually allows the government an opportunity to retry the case, like when the problem is a faulty jury instruction as occurred in the trial of Enron's former chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, or there were prosecutorial misstatements about the evidence like the prosecution of Brocade Communications' former chief executive, Gregory L. Reyes. In Mr. Goyal's case, the appeals court ordered the entry of a judgment of acquittal because it concluded no rational jury could have convicted him based on the evidence presented, a fairly uncommon outcome.
The prosecution revolved around the recognition of revenue from Network Associates' sales of computer security products to a distributor through what is called ''sell-in'' accounting rather than the ''sell-through'' method. Leaving aside the accounting minutiae, prosecutors asserted that Mr. Goyal chose ''sell-in'' accounting as a means to overstate revenue from the sales and did not disclose complete information to the company's auditors about agreements with the distributor that could affect the amount of revenue generated from the transactions.
The line between aggressive accounting and fraud is a thin one, involving the application of unclear rules that require judgment calls that may turn out to be incorrect in hindsight. While Mr. Goyal was responsible as the chief financial officer for adopting an accounting method that likely enhanced Network Associates' revenue, the problem with the securities fraud theory was that prosecutors did not introduce evidence that the ''sell-in'' method was improper under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. And even if it was, the court pointed out lack of evidence that that this accounting method had a ''material'' impact on Network Associates' revenue, which must be shown to prove fraud.
A more significant problem for prosecutors was the absence of concrete proof that Mr. Goyal intended to defraud or that he sought to mislead the auditors. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that the ''government's failure to offer any evidence supporting even an inference of willful and knowing deception undermines its case.''
The court rejected the proposition that an executive's knowledge of accounting and desire to meet corporate revenue targets can be sufficient to establish the intent to commit a crime. The court stated, ''If simply understanding accounting rules or optimizing a company's performance were enough to establish scienter, then any action by a company's chief financial officer that a juror could conclude in hindsight was false or misleading could subject him to fraud liability without regard to intent to deceive. That cannot be.''
The court further explained that an executive's compensation tied to the company's performance does not prove fraud, stating that such ''a general financial incentive merely reinforces Goyal's preexisting duty to maximize NAI's performance, and his seeking to meet expectations cannot be inherently probative of fraud.''
Don't be surprised to see the court's statements about the limitations on corporate expertise and financial incentives as proof of intent quoted with regularity by defense lawyers for corporate executives being investigated for their conduct related to the financial meltdown. The opinion makes the point that just being at the scene of financial problems alone is not enough to show criminal intent.
If the Justice Department decides to try to hold senior corporate executives responsible for suspected financial chicanery or misleading statements that contributed to the financial meltdown, the charges are likely to be similar to those brought against Mr. Goyal, requiring proof of intent to defraud and to mislead investors, auditors, or the S.E.C.
The intent element of the crime is usually a matter of piecing together different tidbits of evidence, such as e-mails, internal memorandums, public statements and the recollection of participants who attended meetings. Connecting all those dots is not an easy task, as prosecutors learned in the case against two former Bear Stearns hedge fund managers when e-mails proved to be at best equivocal evidence of their intent to mislead investors, resulting in an acquittal on all counts. The collapse of Lehman Brothers raises issues about whether prosecutors could show criminal conduct by its executives. The bankruptcy examiner's report highlighted the firm's use of the so-called ''Repo 105'' transactions to make its balance sheet look healthier than it was each quarter, which could be the basis for criminal charges. But the appeals court opinion highlights how great the challenge would be to establish a Lehman executive's knowledge of improper accounting or the falsity of statements because just arguing that a chief executive or chief financial officer had to be aware of the impact of the transactions would not be enough to prove the case.
The same problems with proving a criminal case apply to other companies brought down during the financial crisis, like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and American International Group. Many of the decisions that led to these companies' downfall were at least arguably judgment calls made with no intent to defraud, short-sighted as they might have been. Disclosures to regulators and auditors, and public statements to shareholders, are rarely couched in definitive terms, so proving that a statement was in fact false can be difficult, and then showing knowledge of its falsity even more daunting.
In a concurring opinion in the Goyal case, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski bemoaned the use of the criminal law for this type of conduct, stating that this prosecution was ''one of a string of recent cases in which courts have found that federal prosecutors overreached by trying to stretch criminal law beyond its proper bounds.''
Despite the public's desire to see some corporate executives sent to jail for their role in the financial meltdown, the courts will hold the government to the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and not simply allow the cry for retribution to lead to convictions based on high compensation and presiding over a company that sustained significant losses.

HEADLINE: From the Delta to Winter's Deep Blues

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
CREEDE, Colo. -- Mary Jean Wallace has a stockpile of wood and a caulking gun to patch the drafty walls in the barely winterized cabin that she will be living in through her first winter in the Rocky Mountains. The wardrobe of her old life in Louisiana was tossed aside this fall -- linen giving way to flannel, flip-flops to fleece.
But here is her real secret weapon against the dark and cold and loneliness in a mountain town infamous for all three since the first pickax struck silver here in the late 1800s: books.
As low temperatures and snow have descended on many parts of the nation in recent days, from Minnesota to Florida, Ms. Wallace's plan to burrow in here in south-central Colorado with an author's voice in her ear might seem less practical than, say, an extra pair of dry wool socks. 
But most big journeys in life -- a move to a new place, a new job, a first winter, all three of which apply in Ms. Wallace's case -- require in their own ways, a search for sanctuary. Books, she said, are as good as a psychic shelter as any, and better than some.
''I plan to read my way through,'' said Ms. Wallace, 29, who is finishing a master's degree in history at the University of New Orleans. She moved here to Creede, elevation 8,852 feet, in October, joining a younger sister, Sarah, who came last spring.
Both Wallace women spent summers here in an old family cabin built by their grandfather, a Southern Baptist minister named Emory Wallace who began preaching to the silver miners around here in the early 1960s. And both felt a powerful draw this year in particular, for personal and economic reasons, to make an effort at a permanent toehold.
Sarah, 26, who got a job last spring as one of seven year-round employees at the Creede Repertory Theater, a converted opera house, said she had been warned to have a coat and gloves in her office for when the worst cold came.
''People have told me you have to accept it as a process you have to go through,'' said Ms. Wallace, who does marketing and volunteer coordination for the theater. ''There will be moments when you go stir-crazy and it's dark at 3 p.m., but you take it and you roll with it and know that it will end.''
Heading toward the winter solstice, high canyon walls at the west end of Creede's Main Street bring nightfall early. Deep snows pile up from storms that surge from the south and smash against the stony face of the mountains. For four consecutive weeks last winter, the temperature never broke zero.
''You have to do a personal inventory,'' said Jennifer J. Inge, who came here as a 23-year-old artist in the mid-1970s, bought a 500-square-foot miner's shack and has been expanding it, and making art, ever since.
The real threat of winter, Ms. Inge said, is not the superficial stuff -- the cold and snow and isolation. ''It's not the physical that gets you, it's the emotional and spiritual -- it's how cold the emotional environment can get,'' she said.
Creede's population, which surges to 1,000 or more in summer, crashes to perhaps 250 to 300 this time of year, and the economy goes south with it. If it is after 5:30 p.m. and you want to buy as much as a stick of gum, you are out of luck, and the nearest town, not much bigger, is 20 miles down a treacherous canyon road.
''Creede is not quite the end of the world, but you can see it from here,'' said Richard Brown, 63, who was born and raised here and worked 26 years in the silver mine until it closed in the mid-1980s.
In an odd way, winters got more pronounced here after the mine closed, longtime residents like Mr. Brown said. The day-to-day rhythm of the shift change whistle gave way to a seasonal roller-coaster of feast and famine.
People say they cling to one another through these hunkered-down months and set up buddy systems in case someone has not been heard from or seems to be drinking too much.
''About half the businesses close, and every business that stays open questions whether they'll make it,'' said Bethney Coleman, 21, who grew up here -- one of 11 seniors in the 2008 graduating class at Creede Junior and Senior High School -- and now works as a waitress at MJ's Cafe, a year-round employer.
Mary Jean Wallace will still be working, at least part time, through the winter at Rare Things Gallery, a shop on Main owned by Ms. Inge, which stays open about four hours a day. Ms. Wallace said her boss had become one of a handful of ''mountain mamas,'' as she called them, who had more or less adopted the Wallace women, helping in their transition.
''They say it's three winters and you're in -- anything bad that can happen will have happened by the third winter,'' said Ms. Wallace, who had hoped for a job in a cultural or historical museum in New Orleans but found everyone there cutting budgets. She is committed now to Creede, she said, and hopes to use her education in public history here, though she is not sure how.
But that is a question for another day. For now she watches her pile of books grow -- Isak Dinesen's memoir, ''Out of Africa,'' is near the top, along with a history of botanic gardens, and for page-turning moments, a nice thick stack of Stephen King and Dean Koontz.
And she continues patching cracks in the cabin, which her parents built in the 1980s next door to her grandfather's old place, which is preserved more or less as Mr. Wallace left it when he died in the mid-1990s. Even his table for tying fishing flies -- a skill he insisted that his granddaughters learn as well, just in case -- remains intact, covered carefully with a cloth.
One thing Mr. Wallace was never able to teach his family about, though, since their visits were always in summer, was how to deal with the cold.
''I wave my hand back and forth and try to feel a breeze,'' Ms. Wallace said of her caulking work. ''But I feel like I'm a big faker. I really don't know what I'm doing.''
But she has a place to think it all through as the cold winds howl. She has positioned a big orange chair near the cast-iron wood-burning stove and a reading lamp that will carve out and nourish a small circle of light in the darkest day or night.

HEADLINE: Development Costs Imperil San Francisco's Cup Bid

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The organizers of the next America's Cup said they would accelerate negotiations with other potential hosts for the next event if San Francisco's board of supervisors does not amend its proposal, which will be voted on Tuesday.
The threat came after a flurry of proposals and counterproposals during the past week that call broadly for the Cup organizers to spend tens of millions of dollars to repair part of the San Francisco waterfront in return for development rights there after the event concludes in 2013. 
The organizers and the city, though, are in a dispute about how much should be spent on the repairs and by whom, what property the developers can develop, and other matters.
As the holders of the Cup, the BMW Oracle Racing team has the right to choose the site of the next race. The team, which is led by Larry Ellison, the billionaire founder of Oracle, is based in San Francisco and, along with the America's Cup Event Authority, has been negotiating with the city for months.
To begin the long and complex preparation of the event, the organizers want to announce a host city by the end of the year. To give themselves enough time to pursue talks with other potential host locations, including Rome and Rhode Island, the organizers have told the officials in San Francisco that they can wait no later than Friday to reach an agreement.
On Tuesday, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors is expected to approve an alternative plan that was developed by the supervisors and the Port of San Francisco. A representative for the event organizers claims that plan is insufficient.
''I will talk with the city, but I've also told them the clock is ticking,'' said Stephen Barclay, the chief operating officer of BMW Oracle Racing and a member of the America's Cup Committee. ''If the board goes through with the agreement, then a train wreck will not be avoided.''
Mayor Gavin Newsom has said he wants to win the America's Cup bid before he becomes lieutenant governor next year. He expects the event to generate about $1.4 billion in economic benefits during its two-year run, including tens of millions of dollars spent to improve many piers along the city's northern waterfront. The event would draw thousands of racers and their families to the city for months at a time, as well as tens of thousands of spectators and more than 1,000 members of the news media for races.
But San Francisco expects to run a $380 million deficit in the fiscal year that begins next July, and the State of California has even larger financial problems, so paying the America's Cup organizers a fee to secure the event was deemed impossible. In its place, the city offered building rights along a scenic stretch of waterfront that others had tried and failed to develop.
''From the beginning, we've said we're not in a position to offer hundreds of millions in subsidies,'' said Tony Winnicker, a spokesman for Newsom. ''Instead, we're offering the opportunity to share in the upside of developing San Francisco's iconic waterfront. It's a great deal for the team, but also consistent with the city's goals.''
Even if it is approved by the Board of Supervisors, the plan could be amended to satisfy the race organizers, who complain that the city has reneged on an earlier agreement, and that other locations would pay far more money upfront to host the race. On Monday, a committee of supervisors made additions to their plan that they said would please the race organizers.
Despite the tug of war between the city and the Cup organizers, San Francisco remains a logical place to host the event, which has not been held in the United States since San Diego hosted the races in the mid-1990s.
San Francisco Bay is a windy location, and there are many vantage points for spectators. Parts of the shoreline will need to be dredged, but there is already an infrastructure in place to accommodate large sailboats.
Still, the event organizers would be spending about $300 million to host the race, so they would need to be sure they could recoup their investment.
''We're not in a buoyant time, and there's no one on the horizon looking to develop the piers,'' Barclay said. ''But we won't put the race at risk.''
