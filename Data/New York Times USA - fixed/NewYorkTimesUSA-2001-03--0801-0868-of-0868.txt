HEADLINE: Seattle Soldiers On 

BYLINE:  By David Guterson; David Guterson is author of "Snow Falling on Cedars" and "East of the Mountains."

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
Much trumpeted of late are Seattle's woes earthquake, pandemonium in the streets, assorted cataclysmic economic disasters including the flight of Boeing's chieftains -- a series of vaguely biblical tribulations that have fallen like February rain.
 Such travails might occasion hand-wringing or a long hard look in the mirror. Yet here in Seattle the sum of these events does not seem particularly telling. There is such a thing as a bad luck streak, and we seem to be having one. The recent accumulation of afflictions seems less a harbinger of the city's future than a set of troubling coincidences. Life goes on as usual. The mayor, Paul Schell, makes dismayed pronouncements, sounding, as always, like Eeyore. 
 Elsewhere in the country there is perhaps some satisfaction that Seattle is getting its comeuppance. It's fair to say that the city's new emblems -- the double tall latte, Chairman Bill's earnest face, twenty-something zillionaires accoutered for kayaking in expensive gear -- elicit the kind of hostility long reserved for Los Angeles.
La-La Land and Latte Land now seem to be equal targets of ridicule: to the south the tawdry celluloid behemoth dispensing lowbrow entertainments; to the north the capital of the new economy with its undeserving nouveaux riches and mellow backpackers in Birkenstocks. Here in the Northwest cul-de-sac of the country is now discovered, so it seems, a new city with millennial delusions of grandeur, galling in its self-importance and joined to its left coast cousin to the south by a shared susceptibility to earthquakes.
Astonishing to natives like me is the recent rapid ascent of Seattle as an object of some envy and derision. That our troubles should be met with any interest by those beyond the pale of our rain is unfamiliar and strange. One never gloats, after all, at provincial woes, so perhaps this spate of gloating means something. A national attentiveness to our recent disasters is, for us, more interesting than the disasters, which by comparison seem only like news.
Seattle was once a company town. Boeing dictated the prevailing culture -- sober, analytical, repressed, cheerless, and utterly Northern European. There were engineers at every bus stop who carried their lunches and umbrellas to work and voted for conservative Democrats. There was the smell of fish, and not just for tourists. There were failed poets in the taverns. Our native gloom was ideally suited to repel condescension from outside. But now, faced with envy, we're baffled.
What happened? The indigenous response to the presence of envy is to look at oneself for signs of pretension; and in Seattle the first sign of pretension was the Space Needle, built for the 1962 World's Fair. The second was the ascendance of Kurt Cobain, concurrent with increased flannel shirt sales in the heartland. The third was the anointing of Bill Gates as Caesar, with Redmond, a Seattle suburb, as his Rome. The fourth was the appearance in 1996 of Michael Kinsley on the cover of Newsweek, costumed in yellow sou'wester rain gear, under the headline "Swimming to Seattle." This last was perhaps the moment of our zenith.
The years since then, in retrospect, were something like the tag end of the Roaring Twenties -- and now arrives our current nadir, about which there is little moaning in the streets, teeth-gnashing or tears. In the global economy, everyone is jaded, even out here. That Boeing is leaving should come as no surprise to a town that knows as well as any what globalization and the World Trade Organization portend -- namely, the death of local loyalties and the birth of a new order in which Boeing will be everywhere and nowhere simultaneously, elusive and illusory as Big Brother. 
Seattle, once simply Nowheresville, is now inextricably part of a world in which everywhere is somewhere and nowhere at once; all disturbingly the same. Boeing's Jet City is a thing of the past -- what remains are vestiges, like summer's perennial Seafair celebration with its antiquated roaring hydroplanes, of late under fire from the environmentally correct for their blue-collar noise pollution. And of course, Mount Rainier, which is ever beautiful and indifferent.
The stolid Jet City has become the Emerald City, full of faceted, reflective surfaces. We console ourselves with perpetual rain, which causes everything made by human hands -- O.K., not webzines or America Online -- to decay with a graphic rapidity. This local truth of nature is intractable and reassuring. Rain is our constant. We think.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Legal reform is what the old Soviet bloc needs to put it on the path to growth.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; This column appears here every Thursday. Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu

DATELINE: PRAGUE 

 BODY:
THE transition from Communism to a free-market economy is like changing the engine on an airplane while it is still flying," Gerard Roland of the University of California at Berkeley explained at a conference here. The challenge is to feed, clothe and house people -- and maintain their support for reform -- while overhauling the system of production and distribution.
 The most striking lesson of transition has been that all the former Soviet bloc countries took a steep nose dive after gaining political and economic freedom around 1989; only now are the more successful ones surpassing the meager level of output they had at the twilight of Communism. Economists at the Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education conference chalked up the slow progress primarily to underdevelopment and inadequate enforcement of commercial laws, and lack of encouragement of private start-up companies. 
 In the Czech Republic, for example, which embraced free-market reforms as vigorously as any country did, gross national product was down 13 percent four years after the Velvet Revolution. Just as the country dug its way out of this depression, it was hit by a recession, from which it has only recently recovered. Russia, the basket case of transition, had a protracted 45 percent fall in output.
Even the bright lights, Poland and Hungary, have yet to begin to narrow the gap with the West. The gross domestic product per capita in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic is still less than a quarter of that in Western Europe.
The downturn in Central and Eastern Europe that followed the introduction of markets and privatization of state-owned businesses took economists by surprise. Permitting free markets to allocate goods and services was supposed to improve the efficiency of production, not cause a depression.
Moreover, West Germany and Japan enjoyed rapid and sustained growth after their capital stocks were destroyed in World War II. Economists attributed their success to a well-educated and highly motivated work force. Because Central Europe has relatively well-educated populations who historically had a strong work ethic, many economists -- myself included -- predicted in the early 1990's that the region would quickly narrow the gap with Western Europe.
So what went wrong?
One possibility is that the data are misleading. Under Communism, output was overreported to exaggerate growth; under capitalism it is underreported to avoid taxes. Additionally, official inflation figures -- which showed rapid price inflation when prices were liberalized -- may overstate the true rise in the cost of living because new goods became available and quality improved. Although these factors undoubtedly have merit, they cannot explain the slow growth since the early 1990's.
Perhaps most important, the public believes that the transition has moved slowly. Opinion surveys show that Central and Eastern Europeans increasingly believe the economic transformation has gone badly. Interviews with workers and shoppers at Staromestska Trznice, a middle-scale grocery store in central Prague, reinforced this view. Typical of many people we interviewed, Kveta Vlckova, 45, a co-owner of a small novelty shop, said that 10 years ago she expected the Czech Republic to be like Germany or Britain by now, but it is not close to any country in Western Europe yet.
Jan Svejnar of the University of Michigan says the high-profile debate over whether former Soviet bloc countries should pursue a "big bang" or gradual approach to reform turned out to be a distraction. All countries moved quickly to liberalize prices, stabilize the macroeconomy and privatize state-owned enterprises. But Professor Svejnar says most countries moved too slowly to overhaul legal and regulatory institutions.
"The overall experience suggests that rapid mass privatization, in the absence of a strong legal system, has negative effects on performance," he said, "while the absence of rapid privatization may not detract from growth if the countries expose the state-owned enterprises to relatively hard budget constraints and world competition, and if they create new private firms."
Privatization alone is insufficient. The legal system must protect property rights and allow them to be transferred with minimal transaction costs. Central and Eastern European governments have failed to establish a well-functioning, modern legal system. Instead, many adopted portions of their pre-Communist civil law codes.
In the Czech Republic, for example, until recently borrowers had the right to control a bank's disposition of their collateral if they defaulted. Banks subsidized failing companies. Not surprisingly, many banks failed when the state stopped bailing them out. Foreign banks now own most Czech banks. A similar situation arose in Poland, Hungary and the Baltic States.
Fortunately, the prospect of joining the European Union is inducing Central European governments to reform their legal and regulatory systems, which may explain why their performance has been much better than that of the former Soviet states.
Some economists argue that it was necessary to privatize state assets rapidly before beginning legal and institutional reforms to make the reform process irreversible and prevent the Communists from seizing power again. This argument would be more persuasive had some countries come closer to returning to central planning. Furthermore, quick privatization often led to a class of inside managers who stripped assets and blocked reforms.
In retrospect, Hungary's sequencing of reforms has worked well: it privatized a small number of companies to establish their value and raise revenue, encouraged new entrants who could absorb workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and established a viable legal system before embarking on mass privatization.
The Hungarian economist Janos Kornai has argued that the transition will end when the Communist Party has lost its power, the private sector accounts for most of G.D.P. and the free market coordinates economic activity. By this definition, transition ended in Central Europe about five years ago.
Professor Svejnar, on the other hand, says transition will end when countries establish a functioning market system that generates rapid, sustained growth that enables them to interact with the West without major protection.
Kveta Vlckova had a simpler definition in mind. "It will take decades for transition to end and the Czech Republic to catch up to Western Europe," she said. But she hastened to add, "I think we will get there."

HEADLINE: Misjudgments by an Acting Governor 

 BODY:
As the replacement for New Jersey's former governor, Christie Whitman, who joined the Bush administration two months ago, Donald DiFrancesco has rocketed from the relative obscurity of the New Jersey Legislature to political prominence. The question is whether he is ready for it. After Mr. DiFrancesco, the State Senate president, took on the high-profile job of acting governor in addition to his Senate duties, several lapses in judgment have been brought to light. These include two questionable financial transactions in which he participated and a mystifying blindness to the ethical missteps of his initial nominee for state treasurer. 
 In the latter case, the acting governor failed to respond properly this week to concerns raised about Isabel Miranda, his first choice for state treasurer. Mr. DiFrancesco tried to railroad her nomination through his old Senate colleagues, who wisely delayed their vote on Monday because of accusations -- which she disputes -- that she was fired from Citibank after misusing her expense account for personal trips. Even more troubling, the governor and Ms. Miranda overlooked a clear conflict of interest posed by her decision to take only an unpaid leave from her present job at U.S. Trust Company of New Jersey, a subsidiary of Charles Schwab, instead of resigning completely to take the state job. The state treasurer oversees billions of dollars in investments of potential interest to U.S. Trust and Schwab. 
 Ms. Miranda yesterday decided to step down, thus removing the conflict of interest problem. But Mr. DiFrancesco showed an alarming indifference to the requirements for holding public office.
Earlier, within weeks after becoming acting governor, Mr. DiFrancesco, a Republican, was forced to defend two questionable transactions in which he received financial help from friends or companies doing business with the state while he was in a position to help them as Senate president. Mr. DiFrancesco has denied any personal wrongdoing, saying the financial assistance helped him bail out his relatives in several real estate ventures. But in one case, he borrowed $575,000 from an uncle and close friends at a below-market interest rate of 5 percent. Two of the friends have been longtime appointees to state commissions, and one of these two friends was also later awarded a subcontract for state auto inspections valued at more than $3 million.
Another transaction involved a $225,000 payment Mr. DiFrancesco received from the state's largest homebuilder, whose projects often require legislative or regulatory approval. Mr. DiFrancesco has said there was nothing improper and that the money was an advance on his relatives' real estate project that was lost when the property was foreclosed for failure to pay property taxes. Both transactions, at the very least, display bad judgment for a public official who has held the most powerful job in the State Senate since 1992.

HEADLINE: Met Life in Talks to Move Manhattan Workers to Queens 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, once a giant force in Manhattan as both an employer and a real estate developer, is negotiating to move most of its Manhattan employees to a onetime automobile factory in Long Island City, according to real estate executives and state and city officials.
 The company, second only to Prudential as the largest life insurer in the country, is negotiating for tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives to move about 1,200 employees to the six-story brick building, at 27-01 Bridge Plaza North, in Queens, the officials and executives said. The workers would come from Met Life's longtime headquarters on Madison Avenue and several other locations. 
 Developers and state and city officials are hoping that the company's move to the low-slung neighborhood at Queens Plaza will help anchor a new business district with low-cost office space and stem the flow of white-collar jobs to New Jersey from Manhattan. The city, which is rezoning the area to encourage commercial development, recently began offering special tax breaks and incentives to companies that move there from Manhattan. 
"Snoopy is moving to Long Island City," said City Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, in a reference to the "Peanuts" cartoon character that is the insurer's chief advertising symbol. "This is a solid realization of the potential for commercial development in Long Island City."
But Met Life's relocation to Queens would also mark the shrinking presence in New York of a company that was born in Manhattan 133 years ago and counted 17,000 employees during the 1960's, most of them at the company's two-towered headquarters at Madison Avenue and 24th Street. Before World War II, the company sponsored the tree-shaded Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town complexes on the East River in Manhattan, as well as vast housing projects in Brooklyn and the Bronx. It still owns lots of real estate, but Met Life has only 2,860 employees in New York City today.
The 58-story tower straddling Park Avenue at 45th Street that bears the Met Life name in 18-foot letters is still owned by the insurance company, but very few of its employees actually work there.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said he had been working with the insurance company since late last year, when Met Life announced it was leasing much of its headquarters at 1 Madison Avenue. Met Life, which has to move most of its employees by Nov. 1, has explored a number of locations, including White Plains, Jersey City, Newark and Long Island.
A deal in Queens, where its costs would be half what they would be getting for its space in Manhattan, would net Met Life millions of dollars each year. 
Kevin Foley, a spokesman for Met Life, said that the company was looking at Long Island City but that "we continue to look at other sites."
But state officials and real estate executives who have been briefed on the negotiations said that Met Life was now focused on the building in Long Island City.
David A. Brause, vice president of Brause Realty, which owns the site, a brick factory where workers once built Rolls-Royce automobiles and later single-prop fighter planes, would not comment.
Mr. Gargano said that the state would provide $10 million to $50 million in tax benefits and other incentives if the company moved to Long Island City. The company could move about 1,200 employees to the brick factory building and send 500 more to other locations in New York. But Met Life would maintain its executive offices and about 500 employees at 1 Madison Avenue.
The company is also negotiating with the city's Economic Development Corporation for additional tax breaks.
"We think the benefits are very attractive," Mr. Gargano said. "We hope that we'll close the deal."
Mr. Gargano, city officials and the Long Island City Business Development Corporation have wanted to develop the neighborhood as a secondary office market. The city is reviewing a zoning proposal for a 37-block area near Queens Plaza that would encourage office construction. When Citicorp built a 48-story tower in 1989 nearby, at Jackson Avenue and 45th Avenue, it did not spark a construction boom. At the same time, officials said, they do not want to displace the estimated 15,000 manufacturing jobs in the area.
Officials are hoping that if Met Life moves to Long Island City, other companies will follow, convinced that it is a good location, with eight subway lines linking the area to Manhattan. They are keenly aware that in recent years, companies like J.P. Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Charles Schwab and Wiley & Sons have moved some or all of their employees to Jersey City to escape skyrocketing rents in Manhattan.
"It's the most obvious place to create an alternative location for tenants now looking at Jersey City," said Barry Gosin, chief executive of Newmark & Company, a real estate company. 
But in an odd twist to Met Life's relocation plans, the company is not moving simply because it cannot afford office space in Manhattan. Met Life has found it much more profitable to rent the buildings it owns on Madison Avenue to an investment bank than to occupy it. 
In 1995, the company leased its 29-story Art Deco tower at 11 Madison Avenue to Credit Suisse First Boston. And last year, the company also signed a deal to lease most of its 50-story clock tower and headquarters at 1 Madison Avenue to First Boston, which had acquired Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and needed more space. Now the insurer is asking for hefty tax breaks to move to less expensive space.

HEADLINE: Albany Remains Faithful to Its Traditions: The State Budget Will Be Late Yet Again 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 28 

 BODY:
Admitting that they would miss the April 1 deadline for passing a budget, state lawmakers today passed emergency spending bills to keep the state government running for three more weeks.
 Budget talks between Gov. George E. Pataki and the leaders of the Senate and the Assembly have become deadlocked in recent days. The governor has accused the Legislature of proposing a "spending binge" and has insisted that state spending be kept to $83.6 billion, a 5.3 percent increase over last year. He argues it would be imprudent to raise spending further with the national economy skidding. 
 The Republicans who control the Senate have proposed increasing the governor's spending plan to about $84.1 billion, with much of the extra money going to tax cuts and a modest increase in education financing.
The Democrats who control the Assembly, however, believe revenues will be at least $2.1 billion more than the governor has predicted, and they are pushing for big increases in spending on education, transportation and Medicaid reimbursements to nursing homes. Their plan would cost $85.9 billion.
All sides are predicting the budget battle could take months to resolve. The Legislature last delivered a budget on time in 1985, but in 1998, an election year, they hammered out a deal in April.
"I am not optimistic about this year's budget," Mr. Pataki said yesterday. "We can't afford to just let spending go out beyond what I have proposed."
The Senate and the Assembly both passed legislation this evening that would disburse $4.6 billion to keep government agencies operating for three weeks and continue state aid to cities and counties. Under a 1997 law, lawmakers will not receive their paychecks until a budget is passed. 
They also passed bills extending for three months several programs that were set to expire at the end of the month, among them the Quick Draw lottery game, a program that provides health insurance to indigent children, and the Loft Law, which makes it legal for people to live in old commercial lofts. 
The emergency bill passed the Assembly by a 133-to-14 vote after a vigorous debate during which several Republican members argued unsuccessfully for changes that would put more pressure on the Legislature to meet its budget deadlines. Democrats countered that the annual game of delaying the budget was necessary to extract concessions from the Republican governor on Democratic priorities.
"People in the Assembly and the Senate are standing up for some important things and it takes time to get an agreement from the governor on those important things," said Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried of Manhattan. 
In the Senate, partisan bickering has slowed proceedings to a snail's pace. The debate on the emergency appropriations bill went on until 8 p.m., with Democrats questioning nearly every plank and lamenting the late budget. In the end, the Senate majority voted to end debate after two hours. The final vote was 52-3.
Underlying the budget deadlock is a fundamental disagreement about how much money the state will have to spend. So far, legislative leaders and the governor are still far apart on revenue estimates.
The governor, who is facing re-election next year, has little incentive to pass a budget early. A late budget means more savings because spending in the interim remains at this year's level. The governor also has every incentive to keep spending down in the new budget, so he will have more money to spend in the election year.
The Senate has proposed negotiating with the Assembly without the governor's blessing, but the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, has been leery of that approach since 1997, when Mr. Pataki vetoed several Democratic initiatives after the Legislature passed its own budget.
"Nothing is going on," said John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno. "There has been no serious negotiation."

 NEW JERSEY

IRVINGTON: FIRE DESTROYS TWO BUILDINGS -- A fast-moving six-alarm fire destroyed two apartment buildings yesterday morning and left dozens of people homeless. Although heavy flames and smoke could be seen as far away as Middlesex County, only one injury was reported, to a firefighter who suffered smoke inhalation and a hand wound. He was treated at Irvington General Hospital and released. Fire Chief Don Huber praised a passing five-member crew from Public Service Electric and Gas, who noticed the fire at 937 Clinton Avenue and ran inside, banging on doors and leading tenants to safety.

NEWARK: FOOT-AND-MOUTH WARNING -- Federal agriculture officials have warned the state's livestock producers to watch for signs of foot-and-mouth disease, which is devastating livestock in Britain but has not been detected in the United States. In a letter sent to farmers and veterinarians last week, the United States Department of Agriculture said that the state's huge shipping industry and the large number of overseas travelers at Newark International Airport made New Jersey especially susceptible. Although livestock is a small part of the state's economy, a task force is to meet today to devise plans in case of an outbreak. Andrew Jacobs (NYT)

EDISON: RECORD FUND-RAISER REPORTED -- The Democratic State Committee raised $8.1 million at its fund-raising dinner Tuesday night, more than doubling the previous record, party officials said yesterday. The dinner featured Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and James E. McGreevey, mayor of Woodbridge and the party's likely nominee this fall for governor of New Jersey. The money is intended for voter-registration drives, advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts, and contributions to Democrats running for the Legislature and other elective positions, party officials said. The previous record, set in June, was $3.2 million. Robert Hanley (NYT)

ELIZABETH: MURDER SUSPECT ARRESTED -- A Newark man who the authorities said had robbed and killed a store owner in Hillside was arrested yesterday after he got off a bus in Clarksville, Tenn. The police, acting on a tip, sent a plainclothes officer on the bus trip. The man, Gregory Tillman, 21, was charged with robbing fatally shooting Joseph Licciardello, owner of the Roofing Outlet. A security camera taped the shooting of Mr. Licciardello, 55, and of his son Gregory, 28, the authorities said. The younger Mr. Licciardello survived. Steve Strunsky (NYT)

NEW YORK

QUEENS: PARKING-PERMIT ABUSE CHARGED -- Nine people who work at Kennedy International Airport have been charged with illegally using parking permits to get spaces close to the airline terminals, the authorities said yesterday. Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said the permits were for use only by disabled drivers. Among the nine Kennedy employees arrested were three ramp-service workers, a travel agent, an elevator mechanic and three construction workers, the authorities said. By using the permits, they avoided the trip to a distant employee parking lot and paid a discounted parking rate meant for disabled drivers, Mr. Brown said. Dean E. Murphy NYT)

ROCHESTER: CENTURY-OLD HOSPITAL TO CLOSE -- The board of Genesee Hospital, a 112-year-old institution, has voted to shut it down, citing financial problems. The 425-bed hospital, a subsidiary of ViaHealth, a health care holding company, has suffered increasing losses, which last year were $21.7 million. Executives cited rising drug costs and reduced payments from Medicare as major reasons for the financial troubles, as well as the loss of several large doctors' groups in recent months. ViaHealth said it would try to relocate many of the 2,250 Genesee employees across its system. Jennifer Steinhauer (NYT)

MANHATTAN: COUNCIL OVERRIDES VETO -- The City Council voted yesterday to override Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's veto of a bill requiring the Health and Hospitals Corporation to retain the union security guards at public hospitals. The corporation had wanted to hire nonunion guards at lower wages. The Council originally passed the law intended to protect the jobs of 837 unionized employees on Feb. 7; the mayor vetoed it a month later. The hospital officers are not members of the New York City Police Department and do not carry guns, but as sworn peace officers are authorized to make arrests and perform other police functions. Diane Cardwell (NYT)

MANHATTAN: CUNY FACULTY PROTESTS CUTS -- The faculty and staff union at the City University of New York conducted a day of teach-ins yesterday to rally support for the university and its own contract demands. Barbara Bowen, the union president, said that two decades of budget cuts had greatly eroded CUNY's budget and its faculty, and that reinvestment by the city and state was necessary to improve salaries, working conditions and the education that students receive. She said that all CUNY campuses participated, and that as many as 300 people had attended teach-ins. Karen W. Arenson (NYT)

NEWBURGH: THREE HEARINGS ON DREDGING -- The United States Environmental Protection Agency, after conducting eight public hearings, has scheduled three additional sessions for discussion of the dredging of the Hudson River. E.P.A. representatives will answer questions about the agency's plan to dredge PCB-contaminated sediment from the river and to require General Electric to pay the $460 million cost. The hearings, all at 7 p.m., are scheduled for April 2 at the Newburgh Free Academy, April 4 at Queensbury High School and April 5 at Doyle Middle School, Troy. (AP)

CONNECTICUT

TORRINGTON: THIRD GRADER ARRESTED -- A 9-year-old boy who threatened to shoot and kill some of his fellow third graders at Torringford School was arrested on Monday, the authorities said. The boy, whose name is being withheld because of his age, said he would shoot fellow classmates with a handgun in his pocket, but the police could not find a weapon on the boy or among his belongings. He is being charged with breach of peace. Among the possible penalties are detention, foster care and simple counseling, said Todd D. Fernow, a law professor at the University of Connecticut.

HEADLINE: As Seattle's Economy Slows, Many Like the Change of Pace 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 28 

 BODY:
After the Boeing Company offered some stunning news to its hometown last week, many here took it as the latest bit in a string of misfortune stretching back to the turmoil in the streets when Seattle was the host to world trade talks. 
 Microsoft is fighting an antitrust battle. The go-go dot-com economy is sagging, with the stock of Amazon .com, RealNetworks and other Seattle Internet companies in steep decline. There has been an earthquake and a drought. And now Boeing, the biggest employer in the region, plans to move its headquarters somewhere else. 
 But ask people on the street about Boeing and a surprising theme emerges. Here, where a 19-straight-year economic expansion has brought crippling traffic jams, soaring real-estate prices and angst about the changing character of what had been a famously livable place, many residents feel that a slowdown in the economy would not be so terrible. 
"Part of my reaction was, Yes! Go! Get out of here!" declared Joel Monteith, 38, a business systems analyst at Adobe Systems Inc., the graphics software maker. "That'll be a thousand less cars on the road." 
Maria Zazycki, a dance-company manager who worries about getting squeezed out of her Capitol Hill apartment, had a similar response.
"Honestly, the first thing I thought of was, lower rents," she said.
Census figures show that the Puget Sound region grew by more than half a million people in the last decade, to 3.3 million, and a million more are expected in the next 25 years or so. While people here are not actively hoping for a recession, there is a sense that Seattle needs to slow down. There is also a sense that the city has damaged its blue-collar roots.
"I don't think it's a place that's comfortable anymore for the average working-class person, and that's a shame," said Caro Torgessen, a 44-year-old fisherwoman whose boat is based at the Port of Seattle's Fishermen's Terminal. "You don't feel like it's O.K. to walk around here anymore if you're a person with grease under your fingers." 
Fishermen's Terminal, which the local author Jonathan Raban calls the city's "last bastion of old-fashioned work, with its nets, crab pots, paintbrushes and carpentering," is convulsed by a debate: Should the port open the terminal to yachts and pleasure boaters? The idea strikes many who work on the docks and in the boats as blasphemy. 
Some Seattleites who have felt the ravages of the Internet economy seem to feel ambivalent about the city's downturn. "The place changed; it's like it got greedier," said Anne Buckley, who was recently laid off as a design director when her employer, onhealth.com, was acquired by another company.
Now, Ms. Buckley's stock options are, in industry lingo, underwater, or worthless. That is worrisome, especially since she has a 6 1/2-month-old daughter, Maureen, to care for. Yet Ms. Buckley, who was grocery shopping the other day in the Fremont neighborhood, said she saw a silver lining in the downturn. 
"It gives the Seattle area some breathing room," she said. "It's got to figure out a way to grow a little more intelligently." 
Boeing, by far the biggest employer in the region, says it plans to move only about 1,000 of about 80,000 jobs here out of the area, with its mammoth commercial aircraft unit staying put. 
But if, as some civic leaders fear, the company shifts more operations away, the results could be felt everywhere from the local market to hospitals to cultural and philanthropic circles. Nearly 18 percent of the recent $82.5 million campaign for the United Way of King County came from Boeing and its employees. 
One attraction of Seattle is its spectacular proximity to nature; as former Mayor Norm Rice once put it, this was a place where schoolchildren could "feel their linkages to water and weather, to sense the unfathomable power of salmon returning to spawn after years at sea, to have mountains and the forests as anchors in their souls." 
But now there is a constant fret about how that connection has been eroded. 
"There's a lot less nature and a lot more junk," said Al Kropotkin, a blues musician and Seattle native who lives in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. "There are ugly buildings popping up all over town like mushrooms after a spring rain." 
In many ways, the debate about Seattle's changing character is not new. This is where a movement called Lesser Seattle Inc. arose several years ago against the "greaterism" that some felt the civic boosters were foisting on the city. At times, residents have voted to halt freeway construction or cap the number and height of skyscrapers. 
Then there is this lament, echoed in various ways today: "I remembered Seattle as a town sitting on hills beside a matchless harborage," said one observer of the place known as the Emerald City. But "it is no longer so," he said. "This Seattle had no relation to the one I remembered. The traffic rushed with murderous intensity."
That was John Steinbeck, writing in "Travels with Charley" in 1961. 
Moreover, only in the last few years did the city exceed its peak population of 1960. (It has 563,374 people, the 2000 census says.) It is the region that has grown more. 
Nonetheless, Seattle felt "like this little corner on the map that no one really knew much about," said Linda Bloomer, who works in the banquet department of a hotel and who moved here from Indiana 13 years ago. While the city once struck her back then as affordable, she says housing prices are now outrageous. A house near her apartment in the Queen Anne neighborhood sold for $125,000 when she moved here; it was recently divided into three units selling for $450,000 apiece. 
There are plenty of good things about the way Seattle has changed, said Sigrid Asmus, a freelance editor who moved from New York 30 years ago.
"Culturally, there's a lot more going on," Ms. Asmus said. "In many ways it's a more interesting place."
Asked if she approved of the city's transformation, she paused and said, "I'd say, 70 percent approve and 30 percent violently opposed." 
That answer reflected an ambivalence apparent in the reaction to raucous street demonstrations in late 1999 during the World Trade Organization meeting, an event that city boosters had hoped would show off Seattle as a trade-friendly city. 
"There was some guilty pleasure in the whole thing," said Walt Crowley, who directs historylink.org, a Web site packed with Seattle history. "The feeling was 'Yeah, we're a union town, we care about the environment, we're a little bit suspicious of all this globalism stuff.' So now we're an eponym for anti-globalization. And we shouldn't be too terribly shocked when Boeing says, 'Well, we've got to get out of Dodge.' "

HEADLINE: A Strong Vote Against Soft Money 

 BODY:
There were harrowing moments yesterday when the fractious bipartisan coalition of senators supporting the McCain-Feingold campaign reform bill seemed in danger of blowing apart. Then in a dramatic turnaround, a compromise was reached raising regular campaign donation limits in the bill and swiftly approved by a lopsided vote of 84 to 16. It was nothing less than a historic vote for cleaning up the American election system. The higher contribution limits are less than ideal but modest and far better than the current system. We urge all supporters of campaign reform to protect the bill from being nullified if any part of it is deemed unconstitutional and to vote for its final passage. Rarely has there been the kind of day that unfolded in the Senate yesterday. The arguments were impassioned because the senators were really talking about dismantling a discredited system of campaign finance and moving to something new, unknown and healthy. 
 The core McCain-Feingold bill would ban unlimited "soft money" donations to political parties by corporations, unions and wealthy individuals. The compromise -- worked out by Senators Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican, and Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat -- would increase from $1,000 to $2,000 the amount of "hard money" that individuals may contribute directly to parties and candidates. The cumulative total of an individual's political contributions in a given year went from $25,000 to $37,500. Donation limits to national party committees would be raised from $20,000 to $25,000 a year. All these would be indexed for inflation. 
 By any measure, these are modest increases. They will end the gigantic six-figure contributions by individuals and reimpose the ban on corporate and union contributions enacted decades ago but circumvented by the insidious soft-money loophole. Every Senate Republican voted for the compromise, but many of them are unlikely to vote for final passage of the bill. The votes of all Senate Democrats are needed for that vote. We urge the 16 Democratic senators who voted against the Thompson-Feinstein compromise, many of them sincerely objecting to the new higher campaign limits, to nonetheless support final passage of the bill.
The remaining hurdle for reform is a big one. Many Democrats still want to approve a so-called non-severability measure that would throw out the entire bill if one part of it that would limit fund-raising and advertising by independent advocacy groups is deemed unconstitutional. The vote on that measure is a test of who is for and who is against reform. Among the wavering Senate Democrats are three running for re-election next year. Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Max Baucus of Montana and Tom Harkin of Iowa should not blow the best chance for reforming the system in decades by voting for non-severability or against final passage on grounds that its limits are too high. Senators Patty Murray of Washington and Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, who have had fund-raising responsibility for the Democrats, should also line up against non-severability and for final passage.
Another skirmish yesterday involved a complicated amendment from Senator Charles Schumer of New York. It aims to close a loophole that could be opened if the United States Supreme Court throws out the existing limits on spending by parties in a candidate's behalf. Mr. Schumer's constructive amendment passed by a smaller vote of 52 to 48, over the objections of the Republican leadership. We urge Republican supporters of reform to stick with the bill and its new amendment.
Yesterday looked like a great day for the war on soft money. Today's votes on non-severability and perhaps final Senate passage will determine whether it will be a great week.

HEADLINE: For Bush, an Early Report Card 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "The President on the Economy" (editorial, March 28): 
 You astutely observe that the president's presentation "shows an alarming lack of appreciation for the role that the prudent management of public finances played in the past decade's economic expansion." 
Our president appears to wish to govern as a businessman. By his educational training, he seems well suited to lead in that manner. However, I am aware of no prudent businessman who would dare insist upon a 10-year course of action based on an immediate, emergent need. 
Long-term strategy should be well thought out and debated by the board of directors (Congress) and the shareholders (the voters). Executive management carries out emergent measures. The short run should never drive the long-term strategy.

HEADLINE: Old Rum Distillery Buried As Ground Shifts on Its Fate 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA ROWE 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 28 

 BODY:
Nearly every time a shovel breaks ground for downtown development here, it strikes something from the deep past: In recent years, archaeologists hired to do pre-construction surveys have found Dutch cemeteries, American Indian artifacts and, most recently, an 18th-century rum distillery.
 And just as often, the shovel keeps on going: All of those discoveries have been unceremoniously reburied. Just last Friday, the city dumped backfill over the distillery's vine-tied wooden fermentation vats to make way for a six-story parking garage. 
 Today, however, Mayor Gerald D. Jennings, who has been pilloried in the local press as lacking foresight and an appreciation of his city's history, announced that he had hired a professor from the State University at Albany to coordinate "our archaeological issues" and create a formal plan for preserving future discoveries. 
In addition, the president and chairman of First Albany Corporation, Alan Goldberg and George McNamee, respectively, pledged $40,000 to extricate and preserve some of the distillery -- which now will have to be unearthed again.
Mr. McNamee says he was inspired to make the donation after taking his 6-year-old son to see the distillery, which was discovered on Quackenbush Square in December and has been drawing crowds for the last month.
The distillery, which operated from 1750 to 1810, includes 18 vats connected with an intricate system of wooden pipes, a still, a fireplace, a privy and the foundation of the manager's house.
"We're making personal gifts to underwrite the project because we'd like to see as much attention given to preserving the city's antiquities as possible," Mr. Goldberg said. "These are outstanding examples of life 300 years ago -- apparently there was a lot of rum drunk here -- and we're hoping the city will find some additional money to preserve more of it."
Perhaps the 4,000 visitors who crammed the distillery site before last week's burial, packing restaurants and clearing gift shop shelves at the nearby Albany Visitors Center, convinced Mayor Jennings that it might be worthwhile to make more of his city's 375-year history, especially in light of his efforts to revitalize the downtown. But he said this had always been his intention.
"It's not a change of heart on my part," he said. "We've undergone a billion dollars' worth of growth and development in the last six years, and for a city that was dormant for so long, we had to prioritize."
Assemblyman John J. McEneny, who represents the district where the distillery stands and has written a book on Albany history, said the mayor -- with whom he often disagrees -- should be commended for responding to a public outcry.
"It's a step in the right direction," he said. "When you find the visible remains of the 17th or 18th century, the first reaction should be 'Wow! This is tremendous.' But too often it's 'Oh no, this is going to delay everything.' I've had literally dozens of calls and e-mails asking to save this site. And I believe there can be compromise."
To that end, Mr. McEneny has suggested enclosing the distillery in glass and building the parking garage around it -- in the same way, he said, that a subway station in Mexico City displays Aztec ruins. That suggestion has been scoffed at by the chairman of the Albany Parking Authority, who says people will not visit a historic exhibit in a garage.
Preserving the vats in a museum would be the assemblyman's second choice. But others want the distillery to remain where it is.
"To remove a vat and stick it on a museum shelf does not for me hold as much resonance looking at it in its context," said Dennis Holzman, an antiques dealer who brought his 12-year-old daughter, Martha, to see the distillery on Saturday and left angry that all she could see were backhoes and bulldozers.
There is no consensus yet on where the rescued vats -- eight feet wide, five feet high -- will finally rest, and many may stay buried under the garage.
But their unexpected debut in the 21st century has already made a lasting impression.
A. Nancy Avakian, a retired university administrator who works at the Visitors Center, was shocked to learn that Albany-made rum had been part of the slave trade between Europe, Africa and the New World. 
"They certainly didn't teach us anything about that in fourth grade," she said. 
But Dr. Avakian takes the long view. "A hundred years from now somebody will take down that parking garage and plow over it to build something else," she said. "That's how things are. It's sad or it's progress, depending on how you look at it."

HEADLINE: A Rebuilder In the Bronx Scales Back 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
More than two decades ago, a resilient group of South Bronx residents united to rehabilitate abandoned buildings in their deteriorating neighborhood. Their grass-roots group, which they called Banana Kelly for the curved street where it was born, helped spawn an era of activism in the Bronx and became a much-studied model for neighborhood redevelopment.
 But in recent years, the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association has been more a model of disarray; its buildings and finances are poorly maintained, troubling questions have been raised about its oversight and management practices, and several investigations of the organization appear to be under way. 
 So there was relief, but also a certain poignancy, when the Rev. Louis R. Gigante announced yesterday that his nonprofit group, the Southeast Bronx Community Organization, or Sebco, was taking over management of the last 25 occupied buildings under Banana Kelly's control. The five-year management agreement ends, for the time being, Banana Kelly's role as a developer and manager of housing, and closes a chapter in the South Bronx's history. 
The agreement, which took effect on March 7, means that Banana Kelly will exist, for now, solely as the provider of social services like rental assistance and mental health programs. Fourteen other buildings that Banana Kelly had owned in partnership with the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a national nonprofit group, were taken back by the corporation and turned over to an outside manager. 
Father Gigante spoke about the agreement at a meeting last night of Community Board 2, saying, "My interest with Banana Kelly was, 'If you're in trouble, I'm in trouble. If your buildings sink, it's like an infection that touches my buildings.' "
He added, "I'm not going to see this neighborhood fail." Taking over the management of the buildings was also a good business proposition for Sebco, he said. 
A receptionist at Banana Kelly said yesterday that the organization's chairwoman, Yolanda Rivera, was on vacation. But in a written statement released by Sebco, Ms. Rivera said: "I am pleased that Sebco is taking on the management responsibilities for our buildings. They have a longtime demonstrated ability to operate affordable housing efficiently, and Banana Kelly buildings are sure to improve under their leadership."
Father Gigante, a Roman Catholic priest, founded Sebco in 1968 to address ills like poor housing and drugs that were fraying the Hunts Point neighborhood that included his parish, St. Athanasius. He went on to run successfully for the City Council, but then returned to full-time community work.
In the years since, Sebco has built or rehabilitated about 5,000 apartments, houses, condominiums and co-ops for low- and moderate-income residents in the South Bronx. Its management arm, Building Management Associates Inc., manages about 85 buildings, as well as 70 properties owned by the New York City Housing Authority.
Among Father Gigante's protegees many years ago was Ms. Rivera, who had grown up in his church and worked for Sebco in the 1980's. Ms. Rivera "was one of my girls, one of my kids," he said last night. He has "great regard for her," he said.
Ms. Rivera assumed control of Banana Kelly's day-to-day operations in 1991, and the organization seemed to flounder under her leadership. Its buildings have deteriorated; tenants complained of no heat, of rats, of repairs not done. Its board, which is supposed to provide financial oversight, has been weakened. Its reserves have shrunk, its debts have grown and its finances have become chaotic. Some board members and former employees have raised questions about how government money was used and about the form in which Ms. Rivera is compensated.
The state attorney general has subpoenaed the group's financial records back to 1995 to see whether civil or criminal charges are warranted against any agency officials. One former employee was recently interviewed by F.B.I. agents and by the city's Department of Investigation, according to the former employee, although neither agency will confirm investigations in progress.
In January, Ms. Rivera reached an agreement with Promesa, another Bronx nonprofit group, to manage its buildings. But soon afterward, Banana Kelly pulled out of the agreement, and Ms. Rivera approached Father Gigante. 
" 'I've got my back to the wall. I don't know what to do,' " he said she had told him. 
The new agreement will not solve all of Banana Kelly's problems. Sebco is taking over neither 866 Beck Street, a building so badly deteriorated that it had to be vacated, nor a former synagogue nearby on Fox Street that is also empty. 
Sebco faces challenges of its own. Philip Foglia, the organization's executive vice president, said it was clear that some of the buildings it was taking over need major repairs. Banana Kelly also owes hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes and water and sewer fees. Mr. Foglia said Sebco would begin meeting with regulatory agencies to see how the debt burden could be relieved, and seek loans if necessary.
"We want the people who live in the buildings to feel good about living there," Mr. Foglia said.

The Dispute Within the Verizon-Vodafone Dispute

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
A recent skirmish between Verizon and its wireless partner, Vodafone Group, over technological standards is really just a sideshow to a bigger battle: Vodafone wants to take control of Verizon's wireless unit, according to executives close to the company.
 When Verizon announced last week that it planned to employ a different standard than Vodafone for its next generation of high-speed networks, executives blanched at Vodafone's headquarters in Newbury, England. Their concern was not about customer difficulties. True, Vodafone customers would need special, expensive cellular telephones that have yet to be developed when traveling in the United States, as would Verizon customers traveling in Europe. 
 But the problem was much worse: Vodafone's chairman, Chris Gent, had set his sights on taking over Verizon Wireless within nine months on the way to a seamless worldwide network, according to executives close to Vodafone. And he has no interest in owning a network that is not directly compatible with his. Vodafone already owns 45 percent of Verizon Wireless.
In the wireless industry, scale is everything. Companies like Vodafone rely on price breaks by buying hundreds of thousands of the same thing. Cellular handsets, transmitters, cables, servers and software come at a discount only when bought in bulk.
And Verizon's plan to use a standard called CDMA2000 instead of Vodafone's UMTS means those bulk discounts would be far smaller. An executive close to Vodafone even insisted that Verizon's intention to use an incompatible standard was meant to make it a less attractive takeover target to Vodafone. 
Though executives of the companies talk regularly -- they are partners after all and Vodafone owns 45 percent of Verizon Wireless -- Mr. Gent has yet to initiate takeover discussions, the executives said. But Mr. Gent and his team have begun laying the groundwork for such a move, the executives said, putting together books that demonstrate the strategic and economic reasons for such a deal.
Now Verizon, the nation's largest wireless carrier, may be backing down from its plan to put in force the new technological standard. Vodafone said today that it was negotiating with Verizon over which standard would be used and Verizon said there was no riff between the two companies.
Whatever the final choice, it will still take several years to roll out the new technology.
For Vodafone, the world's largest wireless company, the idea of buying out its partners, even under hostile circumstances, is not new. Back in 1999 Vodafone acquired AirTouch, itself a minority shareholder in one of Vodafone's other partners, Mannesmann of Germany. When Mannesmann invaded Vodafone's home territory by announcing in 1999 that it would buy the British mobile phone network Orange for $33 billion, Mr. Gent decided that Vodafone had to take over its partner turned rival. He made a $183 billion hostile bid and won the company.
Now he wants a larger piece of the American market. Vodafone is taking its time in part because it is still sorting out several acquisitions and its own financial condition. Vodafone participated in a bevy of costly auctions for wireless spectrum in Europe, taking on billions in unexpected debt. The company, like so many other telecommunication concerns, has suffered from a sagging stock price, a currency that Mr. Gent has used to buy out his rivals in the past.
Buying the rest of Verizon Wireless should not be hard. For control, Vodafone needs only an additional 6 percent stake in the unit, which pulled the plug on an initial public offering last year because of the stormy conditions on Wall Street.
It is unclear how much Verizon Wireless would fetch in this volatile market. Yesterday, Verizon's shares fell $2.92, or 5.83 percent, to $47.19. Vodafone shares fell 9 pence, or 4.2 percent, to 204 pence. 
Whether Verizon would be willing to give up control of the wireless unit is unclear. When Verizon was created from the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, the company decided to create one brand for both its fixed line and wireless businesses. The wireless unit was created from the merger of Bell Atlantic, Vodafone AirTouch and GTE's wireless businesses.
But Verizon could just as easily dump control of its wireless business to focus on its local and long-distance strategy and still keep a stake in the growing wireless company, analysts said. Last year, Verizon Wireless added 3.7 million customers, raising its total to 27.5 million, a 16 percent jump over its increase the year before.

Bcom3 Postpones Initial Public Offering

BYLINE:  By Allison Fass 

 BODY:
In another sign of the effect of the slowing economy on Madison Avenue, the Bcom3 Group, the privately held agency company that owns shops like Leo Burnett Worldwide, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Starcom MediaVest, said yesterday that its board had decided against an initial public offering this year.
 In a letter to employees, Roger Haupt, chief executive at Bcom3 in Chicago, said the decision was "based on market conditions." 
 When Bcom3 was formed in January 2000, Mr. Haupt and other top executives said they would favor an initial public offering within 12 to 18 months. "I'm sure you would agree that today's picture is very different from that of a year ago," Mr. Haupt wrote. "Market conditions are volatile and the business environment has changed dramatically."
Because "these conditions are likely to persist for some time," he added, the board "has concluded that it would be unwise for us to launch a new public company in this calendar year."
However, Mr. Haupt said, "The company remains committed to doing an I.P.O." Elizabeth Krupnick, a spokeswoman for Bcom3, said Mr. Haupt was traveling and unavailable to elaborate on the decision.
Bcom3 was formed by the merger of two large privately held agency companies, the Leo Group in Chicago and the MacManus Group in New York, which sold a stake of approximately 20 percent to Dentsu Inc. in Tokyo. Dentsu, also privately held, plans an initial public offering of its stock this year.
Several companies outside of advertising have also recently postponed initial public offerings, citing the volatility of the stock markets and the faltering national economy.

HEADLINE: Zapatista Leaders Make Their Case to Mexico's Congress 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON and TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 28 

 BODY:
In an act of political theater that brought Mexico's fledgling civil rights movement center stage, masked commanders of the rebel Zapatistas took the floor of Congress today to defend a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing new rights for the country's 10 million Indians.
 For nearly two hours, rebel leaders delivered a series of passionate speeches, their identities obscured by the black woolen ski masks they say symbolize the facelessness of indigenous people in Mexico. 
 They urged a half-full chamber -- many lawmakers chose to boycott the session -- to deliver the two-thirds majority vote required to pass an Indian rights bill known as the San Andres Accords.
Rebel leaders said the session, broadcast live on two national television networks, formally marked the end of the Zapatistas' existence as an armed guerrilla movement confined to the jungles of the southern state of Chiapas, and their emergence as an open political force. 
Underlining that point, the group's mysterious and media-savvy spokesman, Subcommander Marcos, was conspicuously absent. The 23-member delegation was led by a Mayan woman who uses the name Commander Esther.
She explained that as the Zapatistas' chief military strategist, Marcos had no place in their peaceful presentation before Congress.
Dressed in an embroidered blouse and sandals, Commander Esther called herself the head of a "legitimate and honest" civilian movement. She said the Zapatistas were prepared to open talks with President Vicente Fox, whom she praised for complying with their demands for the withdrawal of troops from seven bases near rebel strongholds.
But she said two more demands must be met before the rebels would agree to restart formal negotiations -- suspended in 1996 -- to end their seven-year-old conflict.
"In this way, we make clear our disposition toward dialogue, toward the building of agreements and toward achieving peace," Commander Esther said.
The rebels have demanded the release of all Zapatista prisoners. More than 80 have been freed, but the Zapatistas have said others remain in jails in the states of Tabasco, Veracruz and Queretaro.
The rebels have also demanded the adoption of the indigenous rights measures, agreed to in negotiations between the rebels and the government in 1996. President Ernesto Zedillo reneged on his promise to send the bill to Congress, and it was shelved until Mr. Fox submitted it after he took office in December.
The rebels' appearance today was the culmination of weeks of drama surrounding their journey from the wilderness in Chiapas to the boulevards of Mexico City, and their struggle to win a hearing in Congress. It also marked the beginning of a fight to pass the rights bill, which aims to address the historic mistreatment of Mexico's Indian population, the largest in Latin America.
Suffering the legacy of conquest and slavery, Mexico's Indians endure disproportionate rates of illiteracy, malnutrition, infant mortality and unemployment.
President Fox lobbied Congress to accept the rebel delegation and pass the rights bill, saying Mexico's Indians had been "exploited, humiliated, robbed and discriminated against." But his efforts were scorned by many members of his own National Action Party. All but a handful of the party's legislators boycotted the Zapatistas' speeches today, demonstrating that winning passage of the law will be difficult, at best.
Lawmakers and political analysts -- left, right and center -- have raised questions about the bill, which would amend the Constitution to give indigenous communities the power of "free determination" and "autonomy as part of the Mexican state."
The bill would allow local communities to administer justice in accordance with their traditions, while demanding respect for human rights. It would let indigenous people choose their own form of local government, give them greater legal control over their land, take measures to preserve their languages and cultures and run their own media.
Opponents say that traditional councils of elders could suppress individual rights, and that the freedoms granted by the bill could fragment the nation into fiefs.
"We have to be very careful on the one hand not to alter the political structure of the Mexican nation and on the other not to create a situation that marginalizes and and segregates the indigenous," said Enrique Jackson, a Senate leader of the former governing party.
Felipe Calderon Hinojosa, a leader of Mr. Fox's party in the lower house, said he did not want to follow the example of "the United States, which banished the Indians to reservations far off in the mountains and the deserts, isolated and separated them."
But supporters of the bill say the stakes are larger than a struggle for political advantage.
Xochitl Galvez, Mr. Fox's minister for Indian affairs, said Mexico had long seen its Indians "as inferior human beings, and thought maybe if they disappeared, the problems they presented would be solved."
"You could see this as indifference, or you could see it as ethnocide," Ms. Galvez said.
The Zapatistas, she said, have made these people visible and worthy of constitutional protections.
"The indigenous people have already said they don't want to become independent from this country," she said. "The only thing they want is that we recognize that they have rights: the right to be different, the right to speak their language, to be educated in their language, to preserve their culture, to have some control over the land they live on, not to cede it to the local political bosses."
Commander Esther, in her speech to the legislators today, also responded to those who oppose the bill.
"There are those who say that this proposal will create Indian reservations, but they forget that Indians already live separated from other Mexicans and that we are at risk of extinction," she said. "They say that this law will promote a backward legal system, but they forget that the current laws only promote confrontation, punish the poor, give impunity for the rich, condemn the color of our skin and make our language a crime."
After the rebels' appearance in Congress, Subcommander Marcos joined the delegation for a celebratory rally where he announced that the commanders had accomplished the political objectives of their journey and would begin packing on Thursday for their return to Chiapas.
"We are not going with empty hands," he said, adding that they would carry back the support of "those who rose up against the stubbornness of the few who attempted to close the doors of dialogue."

HEADLINE: U.S. Going Empty-Handed to Meeting on Global Warming 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28 

 BODY:
With an international meeting of environment officials scheduled to begin on Thursday, the United States will be in the position of having no policy on global warming, which will be the main issue at the gathering.
 The Bush administration reconfirmed today that it opposed the Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty to fight global warming, and would not submit it for Senate ratification. 
 "The president has been unequivocal," the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said. "He does not support the Kyoto treaty. It is not in the United States' economic best interest." 
Mr. Fleischer, who was asked at a White House briefing to clarify the administration's stance, said the administration was developing other strategies to deal with change in the world's climate.
The meeting of the Western Hemisphere's environment ministers will be the first such gathering since the Bush administration announced earlier this month that it would not seek to regulate power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, a decision that amounted to effective abandonment of the Kyoto accord. 
"We're going into the lion's den unarmed," said a senior administration official who expressed deep frustration that a new policy had not yet been formulated.
The American delegate to Thursday's meeting will be Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who had advised against the decision on power plant emissions but was overruled by the White House. At a news conference on Tuesday, Mrs. Whitman repeated the White House's position that it had "no interest" in carrying out the treaty negotiated in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan.
Administration officials sympathetic to Ms. Whitman's position said she had tried in vain to obtain clear instructions about how to answer questions from United States allies concerned about the carbon dioxide policy. The administration's new stance reverses a campaign pledge made by President Bush and was at odds with the position that Ms. Whitman outlined to other environment ministers just four weeks ago at an international conference on global warming in Italy.
"She's essentially not been given anything to say," one senior official said of the two-day meeting in Montreal, adding that the only thing Ms. Whitman would be able to state authoritatively about the administration's position on global warming was that it was the subject of a cabinet-level review.
Several foreign leaders, including the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, have been outspoken in their criticism of the administration for its opposition to the Kyoto accord. Mr. Schroder is to meet with President Bush at the White House on Thursday, and global warming is expected to be high on their agenda.
A senior official who defended the White House position said foreign governments should not be surprised either by Mr. Bush's opposition to the Kyoto accord, which he has criticized since early in the presidential campaign, or by the lack of a policy so early in a new administration.
"Diplomatically, we're hearing a lot of criticism from a lot of countries, and I suppose at every meeting we go to we'll hear more," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "At the same time, it's been no secret what the president's position on the treaty has been." 
The murmurs of dissent within the administration reflected a view attributed to Ms. Whitman that the White House had been unwise to declare its opposition to the Kyoto pact before it could point to an alternative.
In a memorandum to Mr. Bush earlier this month, before the decision on carbon dioxide emissions, Ms. Whitman warned that most other industrialized nations regarded the Kyoto accord as "the only game in town." 
"There's a real fear in the international community that if the U.S. is not willing to discuss the issue within the framework of Kyoto, the whole thing will fall apart," Ms. Whitman wrote in the memorandum, whose contents were first reported in The Washington Post.
"Mr. President, this is a credibility issue (global warming) for the U.S. in the international community," she wrote. "It is also an issue that is resonating here at home. We need to appear engaged and shift the discussion from the focus on the K-word to action, but we have to build some bonafides first."
The Kyoto accord would require the United States and other industrialized countries to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases by an average of 5.2 percent by 2012 compared with their 1990 levels. The United States and more than 100 other countries signed the treaty, but no industrial country has yet ratified it. An effort by the Clinton administration to win its ratification by the Senate was defeated 95 to 0.
In the United States, most industry representatives have strongly opposed the accord, warning that it would impose enormous costs on the American economy.
An official of the Global Climate Coalition, which reflects industry views, said today that the Bush administration had a right to sever any association with the Kyoto treaty's specific guidelines for emissions reductions.
"There's a fundamentally more effective way of dealing with climate change, which is one based on technological development, and that's the one we support," the official, Glenn Kelly, said.
But a former Clinton administration official, David B. Sandalow, who helped to negotiate the 1997 accord, said the stance would undercut American credibility.
"It's a textbook case of unilateral diplomacy, which rarely works and always brings resentment," Mr. Sandalow said.
An environmental group, Friends of the Earth, called the American stance "environmental isolationism." 
The meeting of environment ministers that begins in Montreal on Thursday will include representatives of Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and other countries from the Western Hemisphere in advance of a meeting of heads of state in May that will be known as the Summit of the Americas.
In terms of global warming, a more important gathering will take place in July, when heads of state have been invited to Bonn under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Global Warming, which President George Bush signed in 1992. That meeting had initially been scheduled for May, but was postponed at the request of the current administration. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 31, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the international treaty on global warming referred incorrectly to a 1997 Senate vote of 95 to 0. The vote registered opposition to some provisions. It was not a rejection of the treaty, which has never been submitted for ratification.

HEADLINE: Schroder Visits Bush Today, Bearing Europe's New Concerns 

BYLINE:  By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, March 28 

 BODY:
A little more than a decade ago, George W. Bush's father played a decisive role in uniting Germany. On Thursday, the president will come face to face with the consequences of that act as he meets a buoyant German chancellor carrying firm, sometimes confrontational, messages from Europe.
 Gone is the Germany that existed during the cold war, sovereign in name but rather less so in reality. Gone is the Germany that knew its interests but seldom dared speak them aloud. In their place is a more confident, assertive nation whose new ambitions Chancellor Gerhard Schroder has come to embody. 
 "The president's father was dealing with a not fully sovereign Germany, the legacy, if you like, of 20th-century history," said Michael Steiner, Mr. Schroder's chief diplomatic adviser. "Now Germany is a partner without restrictions and what we want to address is not the leftovers of the last century, but the future of this one."
Viewing that future, Germany places a priority on the environment, on controlling global warming, on the development of the European Union as a strategic power with its own military component, on conciliation with Russia, and on ascertaining whether "rogue" threats are also real threats before building missile defense shields against them.
All these positions will strain Mr. Schroder's first meeting with President Bush. But the chancellor has come to have a reasonable claim to be Europe's most successful politician precisely because he is a conciliator -- "the man of reason, the peacemaker," as the Frankfurter Allgemeine recently put it. So no fireworks are likely.
After a shaky start, Mr. Schroder, a Social Democrat, has astutely positioned his party as a modernizing force for the economy and captured the repressed yearnings of many Germans by speaking of himself as "a patriot." He has also deftly co-opted opponents and exploited the opposition Christian Democrats' divisions to emerge as a figure with the authority to tell Mr. Bush what is on Europeans' minds.
The concerns include the food they eat, the air they breathe, and the peaceful coming-together of a long-divided continent. Frank Walter Steinmayer, the chancellor's chief of staff, said President Bush's decision to expel 50 Russian diplomats had prompted "surprise and deep concern." So, too, did Mr. Bush's decision to go back on his campaign pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 
Germany, like most European countries, is committed to the carbon dioxide emission standards set at a 1997 international conference -- standards that President Bush now appears ready to ignore.
"We are very concerned about the environment, where we see different values," Mr. Steiner said. "And about food, where the attachment to quality and opposition to genetically modified products is very strong in Europe." 
He compared the situation in Britain, where over 400,000 pigs, sheep and cows have been slaughtered in recent weeks to fight foot-and-mouth disease, to "Armageddon," suggesting this was an illustration that "nature, if it is not respected, strikes back."
Such views may raise eyebrows in the Bush administration, but Mr. Schroder will put them forcefully. The 1990's were years of profound transformation in Europe, propelled by the hot wars of the Balkans and the cold war's end, and there is a feeling in Berlin that the Republicans have not yet grasped Europe's coming of age.

HEADLINE: For Bush, an Early Report Card 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "The Hostage Economy" (column, March 28): 
 I agree with Paul Krugman. If President Bush's tax cut is so good for the country and the economy, why has he been flying around in Air Force One for weeks on end, at taxpayer expense, trying to "sell" it to the American people? Good ideas sell themselves. 
They don't require an expensive and wasteful ad campaign. 
Mr. Bush's time would be better spent in Washington dealing with the California energy crisis. He preaches daily that the American people deserve a break. But what good is a tax cut to California residents if we have to spend it all on our electricity bill?

HEADLINE: Senate Acts to Lift $1,000 Limit On Political Gifts by Individuals 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28 

 BODY:
A day after showing support for a ban on the unrestricted, large-dollar donations that have been flowing into the political system, the Senate voted overwhelmingly today to raise the post-Watergate limits on smaller contributions to candidates and political parties.
 The vote, 84 to 16, came after hours of intensive behind-the-scenes negotiations by supporters of Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin. The Senate's action left few remaining hurdles to the two senators' push for a comprehensive overhaul of the campaign finance law. 
 Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said this evening that he wanted a final vote on the campaign law on Thursday night.
A compromise was reached on how much to raise the contribution limits and it averted a split in the coalition of Democrats and Republicans supporting change. All 16 Senators who voted against the increase in contribution limits were Democrats. But many of them were expected to vote nonetheless for the overall McCain-Feingold bill. 
And Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, put his support behind the increase in limits, saying, "We are now within reach of a bill that can pass the Senate." 
The sponsors of the contribution increase, Senators Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, and Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said they thought they had increased support for the overall bill. President Bush himself had called for an increase in contribution limits.
"Everybody's rolling the dice one way or another," Mr. Thompson said. "My hope is and my opinion is that it probably will benefit the bill." 
Ms. Feinstein said, "There is a basis now where both sides can come together and back this bill."
Under the amendment approved by the Senate, individuals would be able to give up to $2,000 per election to a federal candidate and a cumulative total of $37,500 a year to all federal candidates and political parties. Those figures would be adjusted for inflation by the Federal Election Commission every election cycle. The current limits are $1,000 per candidate per election and $25,000 overall per calendar year.
Political action committees would continue to be held to a $5,000 per candidate contribution limit per election. And the contribution limit to national party committees would raise slightly, to $25,000 per year from $20,000 per year. 
The biggest battle remaining now, after 10 days of debate, is over the question of whether the McCain-Feingold bill will include an all-or-nothing provision that would result in the entire measure being thrown out if the Supreme Court rules against any of its individual provisions.
President Bush and many other Republicans say such language is necessary to ensure that any legislation is balanced and does not have unintended consequences if only parts of it are found constitutional. Mr. McCain and Mr. Feingold call such a measure a "poison pill" designed to overturn the ban on big donations at the heart of their bill, since most of the constitutional questions concern other provisions, such as the bill's effort to rein in issue advertising. Many senators say the issue-ad provisions violate the First Amendment. 
The importance of this fight, expected on Thursday, was underscored when Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is the bill's chief foe in the Senate, promised today to challenge the measure's constitutionality in court should it become law. The Southeastern Legal Foundation also announced that it would challenge the bill if it becomes law.
The centerpiece of the McCain-Feingold bill is a ban on the unrestricted donations to political parties that have steadily escalated over the past decade, undercutting the 1974 limits on contributions. Such donations to the national political party committees -- known as soft money -- reached a record of nearly $500 million in the 2000 election. 
But many lawmakers are equally concerned with the $1,000 limit on individual contributions, which they said forces them to dial constantly for dollars in order to raise enough money for the television-era campaign. Such donations are called hard money.
Mr. Thompson argued that the average cost of winning a Senate seat had risen to $4.5 million in 1998 from $600,000 in 1976, and that now was the time to make a change.
"A lot of blood has been spilled on the Senate floor just to get here and get this debate," he said. "It may be another 25 years before we have another debate such as this. Let's come up with some reasonable amount, index it for inflation, so we don't have to go through this again, because in fact we probably won't go through this again."
But Democratic critics were leery of raising the limits too high. "It would be a great tragedy in our view to finally close the door on soft money and then open up the barn door on the other side to a flood of hard money," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. Mr. Dodd ultimately voted for the compromise.
Adding to the concerns of the Democrats was the fact that their party has caught up with the Republicans on high-dollar soft money fund-raising, but is well behind Republicans in bringing in smaller contributions.
In a sign of the difficulty lawmakers were having striking an agreement this morning, the Senate, in essence, backed two competing proposals. By a 54-to-46 vote, it kept alive an amendment proposed by Mr. Thompson that would have raised the current $1,000 per candidate per election donation limit to $2,500 and the aggregate donation limit to $100,000 to candidates and parties across two years.
The Senate also, by an identical 54-to-46 vote, kept alive a competing proposal by Ms. Feinstein. Her amendment would have raised the individual limit to $2,000 and the two-year aggregate limit to $65,000.
The Senate then went into hours of suspended animation so that all sides could try to negotiate a compromise. At midmorning, Mr. Daschle, who has been working alongside Mr. McCain and Mr. Feingold for the past 10 days, insisted he would agree to nothing higher than the figures contained in Ms. Feinstein's proposal. He said her proposal, when all its parts were added up, would allow couples to contribute a total of $130,000 per campaign.
"That $130,000 a couple ought to be enough for anybody in a campaign," Mr. Daschle said. He added that Mr. Thompson's amendment would allow a couple to spend $200,000 a cycle. "That isn't reform," Mr. Daschle said. "That's a mockery of reform proposals."
But he eventually agreed to the compromise, even approving some final provisions on the Senate floor minutes before the proposal was presented to the full Senate. 
"I support this compromise reluctantly because it is necessary to keep us moving forward," he said, adding, "The real victory here is that the reform coalition has passed another critical test."
Should the Senate approve the McCain-Feingold bill, the battle will move to the House, which has twice passed similar legislation by comfortable margins. But with President Bush telling Republicans that they should not count on him to veto a bill, Representative Tom DeLay, the House Majority whip from Texas, has vowed to do everything he can to stop the bill.
The Senate also voted tonight, 52 to 48, to approve an amendment sponsored by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, designed to give political parties an incentive to observe current limits on spending on behalf of candidates even if the Supreme Court throws out such limits. His amendment would require the parties to observe the limits in order to qualify for discounted television rates for advertisements.

Viacom to Keep Blockbuster Unit
Stock in Blockbuster, the home video retailer, rose slightly on news that its parent, Viacom, was so pleased with the unit's performance that it had decided not to spin off its 82 percent stake.

HEADLINE: Z3 in South Carolina: Just Visiting 

BYLINE:  New York Times Regional Newspapers 

DATELINE: GREER, S.C. 

 BODY:
SHROUDED for secrecy, a prototype of the next Z3 roadster recently made its way here from Germany to BMW's only American assembly plant.
 Employees of the BMW Manufacturing Corporation said that only those on a short list of factory personnel were allowed to view the car before it was trucked back to an airplane and flown home to Germany. 
Bunny Richardson, coordinator of corporate communications, would not confirm or deny the visit. "I didn't see it," she said. 
 "BMW has not talked, or even teased, about its new models until it's ready to show the customers; it's the same thing we did with the X5," Ms. Richardson said, referring to the company's sport utility vehicle, which is made at the plant along with the current Z3. "We're not prepared to talk about the timing or models of new vehicles."
Ms. Richardson said the plant was doing everything it could to prepare for future models, whatever they might be. While a Z3 replacement is on the list of possibilities, so are new sport utilities. Even before the X5 went on sale a year ago, there were discussions of smaller and larger models.
Susan Jacobs, an auto industry analyst in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., said preparation for a new Z3 was especially important amid an economic slowdown and stiff competition among sporty two-seaters. "The market for roadsters for the next few years may not be that good," she said.

HEADLINE: Irish G.D.P. Seen Rising 7.5% 

BYLINE:  By BRIAN LAVERY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, March 29 

 BODY:
Ireland, the hottest economy in Europe, will not be quite so torrid this year, but it will still far outrun its trading partners in Europe and North America, according to forecasts from the country's central bank released this week.
 The bank said the economy could readily weather both a possible recession in the United States and Europe's intensifying problems with livestock diseases. 
 Annual growth in gross domestic product will not match the record pace of nearly 11 percent set in 2000, the bank said; 7.5 percent is more likely. A national outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease -- only one case has been detected here so far -- might shave two percentage points off the figure, because it would crimp tourism as well as agriculture. 
The worldwide high-technology slump poses a more serious threat, the bank said, especially to exports, which will grow only 11.5 percent this year, down from 20 percent in 2000.
In an economy expanding so rapidly for so long, price pressures are hard to avoid, and Irish inflation reached 5.6 percent last year, the highest in Europe. The underlying causes may be more serious than that figure shows, according to the assistant director general of the bank, Michael Casey. Traditional measures of inflation, like a consumer price index adjusted to be comparable across Europe, "tend to flatter us a bit," he said. 
Double-digit growth has also left the Irish public with high expectations that may be damaging the economy from within. Wages in Ireland are increasing at four times the European Union average.
"Earnings growth per capita of 10 percent a year has to be seen with some concern," Mr. Casey said. "It may be time for a reality check."
Government employees are tied into a national wage agreement that promises annual salary increases of about 7 percent. But unions have grown increasingly frustrated with the deal as pay in the private sector skyrockets. Labor strife, particularly for transportation companies, has become commonplace.

HEADLINE: Once Again, the City Beckons 

BYLINE:  By Kenneth T. Jackson; Kenneth T. Jackson, a history professor at Columbia, is the author of "Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States" and editor in chief of "The Encyclopedia of New York City."

 BODY:
Americans don't like cities. Never have. Never will. Nonetheless, we have built big buildings and big places. A century ago, for example, New York and Chicago were already home to most of the planet's skyscrapers and places like Milwaukee, San Francisco and Memphis, which had not even been dots on a map in 1800, could each count hundreds of thousands of residents.
 Yet Americans apparently did not like the cities they had built, for they began to escape them as soon as possible, not for the life of the yeoman farmer, as Thomas Jefferson would have preferred, but for the pleasures of suburban living. The process began about 1825, when the developer Hezekiah Pierrepont sold residential lots in Brooklyn Heights to South Street merchants who preferred to live near their businesses in crowded lower Manhattan. Brooklyn Heights offered less congestion, better views, cheaper real estate and purer air, not to mention a quick commute by ferry across the East River. 
 As the century progressed, New York's suburban edge moved outward. By 1898, more than 100,000 people a day were commuting into Grand Central Terminal and equally large numbers were entering the city from the south, the east and the west.
With minor variations, a similar process occurred around every American city, and in the 20th century suburbia became the quintessential feature of American life. The results are everywhere visible. Bulldozers north of Atlanta, south of Denver, east of Memphis and southwest of Kansas City are at work constantly, flattening the land and clearing the trees to make room for new subdivisions and ever more chain stores. In the 21 million person New York metropolitan area, the fastest growing suburbs are in Pennsylvania, at least two hours by car from the George Washington Bridge. In Los Angeles, demographers consider the urbanized region to stretch over 14,000 square miles, a space more than twice the size of Connecticut.
At the same time, older American cities are decaying and forlorn. Those that have been unable to expand their boundaries in the 20th century have experienced sharp declines in population. Thus, St. Louis, Buffalo, Pittsburgh and Detroit have lost more than a quarter of their populations since 1950. The cities avoiding this fate, like Dallas, Houston, Phoenix and San Diego, have each added dozens, even hundreds, of square miles to their municipal jurisdictions since World War II. But their densities have decreased because their space has expanded faster than their populations.
Will the emptying of American cities continue? Will the great metropolises of our time, like conquered Carthage, be plowed with salt? Many futurists have answered affirmatively, suggesting that a new science of telecommunications would make personal human interaction unnecessary. 
Such predictions will prove to be wrong. The 2000 census found a record 8,008,278 residents in New York City, not including tens of thousands of illegal immigrants who avoid any government enumeration, and not including celebrities, captains of industry and empty nesters who maintain Manhattan apartments but, for tax reasons, avoid making New York their legal residence.
Eight million is a big number with big implications. Gotham is growing faster than New York State and faster even than its suburbs. It is too early to know whether this is a statistical blip. But the 2000 census may mark a major demographic reversal of a suburban pattern that is now almost two centuries old. New York City, after all, is not unique. San Francisco has also increased its population density since 1950, and Chicago and Boston have been doing so since 1990. Even Los Angeles, long the poster child of the suburban trend, has recently become more like Eastern cities, complete with a subway and higher density. Indeed, in the past 20 years, about 40 percent of Los Angeles regional growth has come in older areas that have virtually no "raw" land.
Such inner-city revitalization is being fueled by immigrants, who are flocking to American cities. New York has always been the quintessential immigrant metropolis, a place of dreams and magic, opportunity and hardship. And everywhere we look, newcomers are giving life to neighborhoods that otherwise would be in decline. Twenty years ago, the South Bronx was full of abandoned buildings; today, it is thriving. Similarly, since 1975 the borough of Queens has become the most ethnically diverse place in the world.
The urban renaissance is also fueled by young childless professionals who find Gotham's catalytic mixing of people, its narrow streets and its hectic pace to be a turn-on. After growing up amid spacious lawns and ubiquitous shopping malls, they now prefer an urban, even an urbane, lifestyle and are willing to swap the usual trappings of middle-class success -- a car and a house -- for bustling sidewalks, outdoor restaurants and funky galleries. For them, density is preferable to isolation.
Why did the city become popular in the 1990's? One typical response is the booming American economy. But in the United States, good years for the economy have usually meant good years for suburbanization and bad years for cities. Rather, the single greatest catalyst to inner-city revitalization has been a sharp decline in crime. Across the nation, homicide and automobile theft rates have been plummeting, especially in the biggest and most crowded cities. 
New York City, in fact, is now one of the safest places in America to live, partly because of a low homicide rate, but mostly because of a low motor-vehicle death rate, made possible by densities that encourage walking rather than driving.
Unfortunately, immigrants without options and yuppies without children cannot by themselves revitalize our cities. Only ordinary families with ordinary incomes can do that. If New York -- or Boston or San Francisco or Chicago -- is to return to the glory of its past, then average men and women must choose to remain in the city after they have children. At present, many families move to the suburbs for the presumed superiority of the schools there. Our challenge then is to improve the inner-city schools so that contemporary families will once again know, as immigrants knew a century ago, that the public schools represent an avenue for opportunity and learning. Until we have that, the reconstruction of our cities will be only a sham.
Great cities are necessary for great civilizations. American cities are still where people of different bents and pursuits come together and where new ideas are born. As Charles E. Merriam, a University of Chicago professor, told the United States Conference of Mayors in 1934: "The trouble with Lot's wife was that she looked backward and saw Sodom and Gomorrah. If she had looked forward, she would have seen that heaven is also pictured as a city."

HEADLINE: The Olympics Can Help Reform 

BYLINE:  By Zhang Liang; Zhang Liang is the pseudonym for the compiler of "The Tiananmen Papers."

 BODY:
I belong to a group of reformers in the Chinese Communist Party who are urging the party to acknowledge its mistakes in the bloody crackdown on Beijing demonstrators in 1989. Despite this, we reformers also urge the International Olympic Committee to grant the city of Beijing the right to be host of the Olympics in 2008.
 Some may find our attitude contradictory. Some human rights advocates in the United States have urged the I.O.C. to deny Beijing the Olympics on the grounds of China's poor human rights record and the treatment of religious dissidents and demonstrators. Others warn that Beijing's rulers may exploit the Games to cement their rule, as Adolf Hitler did in 1936. 
 We respectfully disagree. Although we are as concerned as anyone about China's human rights record, we believe that granting the Games will do nothing to damage human rights and will do something to improve them.
The key to our position is that the Games, if awarded to Beijing, would take place in 2008. By that time, the Chinese leadership will have undergone two shifts of personnel. The current group headed by Jiang Zemin is scheduled to leave the stage in 2002-2003. Their successors will undergo a second turnover five years later, in 2007-2008. We are working to make this change as complete as possible.
That is why we have published "The Tiananmen Papers," a record of the party's decision to crack down on pro-democracy demonstrators in June 1989, and why in April an even fuller record of how the leaders reached that decision will be issued in Chinese. Although the book is banned in China, the Chinese edition is sure to find its way home through the Internet and in smuggled copies.
The party today is deeply split. The reformist group to which I belong believes that the publication of "The Tiananmen Papers" and other actions undertaken by us and by others will help end the grip of the current group of autocrats. The granting of the Games would help this process by committing China more firmly to an open door and providing a focal point for further struggles for the rule of law and human rights.
The vast majority of Chinese people clearly support the granting of the Olympics to Beijing. To be sure, their reasons for this are quite different from those of officials. While the government wants to land the Olympics in order to gain prestige to help consolidate its faltering legitimacy, the people's thinking is more straightforward: Why shouldn't the nation with the largest population in the world finally have its chance to hold the world games? A rejection of China's bid for the Games would allow conservative leaders in China to exploit anti-Western sentiments and enhance their legitimacy in a way that would hamper rather than help our efforts.
The policy of isolating China is neither effective nor necessary. Economic freedom is increasing, and party control over people's lives is declining. The power of these trends was demonstrated by the nationwide scope and vast social base of the 1989 people's movement. Politburo Standing Committee minutes of the time show that a three-man majority of that top body was willing to enter into dialogue with autonomous student organizations. Only the constitutionally irregular intervention of Deng Xiaoping and seven elderly colleagues handed victory to the hard-liners and put a temporary halt to China's movement for political change.
Symbols matter. Just as the Tiananmen tragedy must be acknowledged in order to free China to resume its interrupted evolution toward democracy, so, too, the grant of the Olympics would promote China's commitment to human rights and international cooperation.
Although little known to outsiders, the issue of financing the Beijing Olympics has become a matter of sharp controversy among Chinese leaders. Millions of Chinese live in dire poverty, and government budgets at all levels are stretched to the breaking point. As reformers and democrats, we believe in this matter of principle: While supporting the Beijing Olympics, we are opposed to any grant from the national treasury to pay for the municipality's costs in holding them.

HEADLINE: Drug Research Inadequate, White House Panel Finds 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
The quality of data and research on what works to reduce the supply and demand for drugs is so poor that no accurate assessments can be made, a report commissioned by the Clinton White House and released yesterday has concluded.
 The report, by 15 economists, criminologists and psychiatrists assembled by the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, took no position in the heated debate on whether to give more attention to drug enforcement or drug treatment. 
 But the experts recommended a series of steps to increase government financing for research into drug control policies and for better ways to gather accurate data. 
Otherwise, Charles F. Manski, the chairman of the committee and a professor of economics at Northwestern University, said in an interview, "We are concerned that 10 to 20 years from now we will still be in the same position, still having these same fruitless debates forever."
Professor Manski added, "The bottom line message is, we simply don't know enough to know the effects of current enforcement policy."
The study was financed by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and commissioned in 1998. 
In a statement yesterday, the acting director of the Bush White House drug control office, Edward H. Jurith, said, "We will pay close attention to the report's findings, particularly the need for improved data and research in the area of law enforcement." 
But Mr. Jurith added that drug control "is not a perfect science." In fact, he said, "significant progress has been made in drug research in recent years," citing with approval several studies that the committee criticized as flawed. 
The experts found that even what might seem the simplest measures of success in the battle against illegal drugs are unreliable.
For example, it has long been widely accepted that successful programs to reduce the supply of heroin or cocaine from abroad, along with tougher law enforcement on the streets, tend to drive up the price of the drugs.
But the committee found that the data used to measure drug prices, obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration when it makes arrests, vary enormously from place to place and year to year.
Similarly, the report said, studies of whether drug treatment works and whether it is more cost-effective than enforcement are flawed because they do not use the scientific method of comparing randomized groups -- for example, comparing one group of prison inmates who have participated in a treatment program with another group of inmates who have not. 
The report noted that the $30 billion spent in 1999 by federal, state and local governments to combat illegal drugs was twice the American cost of the Persian Gulf war of 1991.
The report also said that the number of people arrested in drug offenses in 1998, 1.6 million, was three times greater than in 1980, and the number of people incarcerated in state prisons on drug charges in 1998, 289,000, was 12 times the number in 1980.

HEADLINE: A Hawk's Candidacy Gains in Besieged Colombia 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: NEIVA, Colombia 

 BODY:
When Alvaro Uribe Velez, a presidential candidate, arrived here in southern Colombia on a recent campaign swing, he found an eager audience.
 A university auditorium was filled, business leaders showered him with praise and the local news media scrambled for interviews. The fact that the election is not until May 2002 hardly seemed to matter. 
 The reason for the enthusiasm is that Mr. Uribe -- 48 years old, a former governor and Oxford scholar, a landowner and an expert horseman -- is proposing a major expansion of security forces to combat rampant crime and loosen the hold of two rebel groups on the countryside. 
If elected, he says, he will double the national police force to 200,000, and increase the number of career soldiers to 60,000 from 40,000. He would also arm a million civilians as reinforcements. 
"What we need is to put a stop -- radically put a stop -- to the kidnappings and the murders," Mr. Uribe told supporters at Neiva's tiny airport. "Here in Colombia we can either make more room for the violent ones, or we can help the people." 
For Neiva -- a city where rebels have for years kidnapped ranchers, extorted money from business leaders, operated roadblocks and exchanged gunfire with soldiers -- Mr. Uribe's hard-line prescription was just what many wanted to hear. 
But his candidacy has alarmed rights groups and some Colombian officials. They say he would promote paramilitary violence and intensify an already brutal conflict. "We see his stance as a sign of the strongman, militarized solution to Colombia, which won't resolve anything but will just prolong the conflict," said Winifred Tate, a Colombia expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, which lobbies on rights issues. 
Mr. Uribe's rising fortunes are also significant because Colombia has in the recent past been a centrist nation, rejecting right-wing and left-wing candidates, especially those who, like Mr. Uribe, run outside the two-party system.
But there is a growing sense here that an authoritative leader is needed and Mr. Uribe is fast gaining support, particularly among the middle class and the wealthy, underscoring the country's shift to the right as a recession continues and President Andres Pastrana's peace efforts with the rebels falter.
"There's a hardening of Colombian public opinion that is playing into a draconian approach," said Bruce Bagley, a Colombia expert at the University of Miami. "What I am hearing is a polarization of the far left and the military right, with Uribe as the candidate emerging from all of this." 
In Neiva, supporters say Mr. Uribe is the one politician who might be able to end Colombia's 37-year-old conflict, most likely through dogged negotiations from a position of strength. Supporters also like his tough talk about ending corruption and slashing government spending.
"We like the politics that he expounds because it's the politics of order, the politics of complying with the law," said Diego Dario, president of the Chamber of Commerce in Neiva.
Many of his staunchest supporters, the wealthy elite and landowners, can relate to an educated, successful man who comes from the countryside and has suffered at the hands of the rebels. Mr. Uribe says his father was killed by guerrillas.
"Alvaro Uribe has felt the weight of violence," said Jorge Visbal of Fedegan, the Colombian cattle ranchers' association, whose members overwhelmingly support Mr. Uribe. "He felt it in his family. He's known it because it has hurt him."
Detractors, however, see a demagogue in sheep's clothing, a politician who is "looking for national office, so he has modified his rhetoric somewhat," as Mr. Bagley put it.
Critics note that when Mr. Uribe was governor of the economically important province of Antioquia, from 1995 to 1997, right-wing paramilitary groups there grew rapidly. Although these groups have killed villagers they suspect of being sympathetic to the rebels, the provincial government did little to stop them. 
Mr. Uribe also promoted and fostered organizations called Convivirs, which were ostensibly to provide intelligence about rebels to security forces, and he said they helped cut crime and violence sharply.
But Human Rights Watch and the United Nations high commissioner for human rights said the groups had also committed homicides and threatened villagers. Mr. Pastrana, who won the presidency in 1998, stripped the groups of their power, and government officials say they no longer legally exist.
Mr. Uribe also staunchly defends two generals who were retired by Mr. Pastrana in 1999 after allegations surfaced that they had ties to these paramilitary units.
Mr. Uribe says the military is unfairly criticized for rights abuses. And he says that had the Convivirs been allowed to continue operating, they would have significantly reduced the rebel presence in Antioquia. 
"What did happen after I left office in my state?" he said. "The government debilitated the support for the armed forces. The government abandoned the community organizations. Kidnappings increased again. Roadblocks appeared again, and homicides went up."
Mr. Uribe, who is trim and bookish and speaks an elegant and purposeful Spanish, said he does not mind being cast as a hard-liner when it comes to rebels. He said that if elected, he would closely monitor the militias he proposes, to prevent them from becoming paramilitary groups.
He also said his government would continue the peace talks started by Mr. Pastrana. But the rebels, he said, would have to agree to a cease-fire and international monitors in the region that they now control with government approval. If they refused, he said, his security forces would start an offensive.
As governor and, before that, a senator, Mr. Uribe was a member of the Liberal Party, one of Colombia's two main parties. With the Liberal Party supporting another candidate for the presidency, however, he formed his own movement, Colombia First.
In polls, Mr. Uribe remains third behind Horacio Serpa, the Liberal candidate, and Noemi Sanin, a Conservative Party politician with extensive government experience. But Mr. Uribe's support is growing. In a Gallup poll in December, 17 percent of those polled supported him, compared with 5 percent in August. Mr. Uribe faces an uphill battle but political experts say he is doing well for someone without national name recognition. With 14 months to go before the election, they say Mr. Uribe could gain support if President Pastrana's peace efforts falter.
"If things go well for Pastrana, Alvaro Uribe's poll numbers will go down," said Eduardo Barajas, a political scientist in Bogota. "If Pastrana's efforts go down, Alvaro Uribe's poll numbers will go up. For him to win, the peace process would have to not advance very much."
Still, Mr. Uribe, who studied conflict resolution at Harvard and Latin America's troubled history at Oxford, understands that for millions of Colombians, security and conflict are not the only concerns. There are concerns about unemployment, the dire prospects for agriculture and the fact that education is woefully underfinanced and inadequate.
So on the campaign trail, he talks about his accomplishments as governor. He points out that he established 103,000 places for schoolchildren in three years. (Only 54,000 had been opened in the previous 10 years.) And he talks about how he hammered away at corruption, cut the state work force to 5,000 from 15,000 and built 650 miles of roads.
Sweeping through a farmers market in Neiva, he stopped to chat with poor farmers and vendors, chomping on fruit as he conversed about the economy and unemployment.
Spotting a small boy in a torn shirt, Mr. Uribe asked him why he was not in school. The boy simply shrugged, embarrassed by the attention. 
Mr. Uribe turned and said: "This is one of my big concerns. Three million children who are outside of the school system. We have to do something."

HEADLINE: Business on Internet Time; 
The Ups Are Fast. The Downs Could Be Even Faster.

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
As one of the brightest lights of the Internet revolution, Cisco Systems has long been looked to as the company that not only supplies the equipment that holds the Web together but also understands how information technology makes business work smarter.
 So when Cisco announced earlier this month that orders for its products had unexpectedly plunged and that revenue would decline for the first time in its 11 years as a publicly traded company, it did not just send shudders through the company itself and its own suppliers. It also raised profound questions about the role of the Internet in the current slowdown. 
 The Internet, with its myriad online connections, speeds the transmission of ideas, good and bad, and amplifies their reach. It has allowed business managers to peek into every link of the supply chain that feeds their manufacturing processes, and to change direction with a nimbleness that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. 
Yet power incites hubris -- a Porsche fairly demands to be driven at breathtaking speed. The result for the economy can be jarring.
"The supply chain looks a lot more like the stock market," said Andrew B. Whinston, director of the Center for Research in Electronic Commerce at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas. "It becomes much more volatile."
And that could help to explain why the economic downturn seems to be happening on Internet time.
Since last summer, the economy has gone from a racetrack annual pace of almost 6 percent to barely 1 percent. Business executives in one industry after another have described being stunned by the abruptness of the drop in orders. Caught by surprise, manufacturing companies have watched their inventories soar.
With all the information supposedly at their fingertips, why were executives so out of touch?
There appear to be several related reasons. As in past business cycles, companies caught up in the boom expanded capacity and output to meet expectations of continued strong growth that simply was not sustainable by all of them together. But added on top of that, it seems, was a sense of complacency that the new management-information tools would provide plenty of advance warning of troubles ahead. That may have been asking too much of them.
"It's important to understand that the Internet cannot change what is going on in the marketplace," said Susan L. Bostrom, senior vice president of Cisco's Internet business solutions group. "You can manage those variables that you can control, but what makes business fun," she said with a nervous laugh, "is that there are always variables that you can't control."
Finally, with so many companies farming out actual production to contract manufacturers, some clearly lost touch with the overall market environment.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, normally one of the Internet's biggest boosters, has started to warn that speed has its risks -- and that it complicates his job as well.
Many companies "were caught with their pants down," said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Economy .com, a consulting firm based in West Chester, Pa. "Maybe the technology isn't as good as we thought it was in terms of inventory management." On the other hand, he said, "Maybe it's good, but it's only good if you believe it."
Some of the boosters of the new technologies of manufacturing and inventory management doubt that much of a downside exists. "I'm not quite sure of the problem we're creating by having this good information out there," said Steven Y. Gold, a managing director of the consulting giant KPMG.
Yet other experts say it is no surprise that the technologies that speed up business decision-making and operations can be a double-edged sword. Peter G. Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI International who has studied technological risk for decades, sees it as even more complicated than that.
"Many of the swords have more than two edges," he said, "sort of a Swiss Army Knife with blades in upside down, so that you keep cutting yourself on some of the implements whenever you try to take one out."
The new speed of business is also less forgiving than before, says Allen J. Delattre, an expert in connecting electronics manufacturers and suppliers for the consulting company Accenture. He compares the pace of business just five years ago to driving in city traffic at 20 miles an hour.
"If somebody slams on the brakes," he said, "everybody can slow down." But today, "when we're running stock cars at 200 miles an hour, a slight misstep can cause a pileup with great carnage."
When discussing the downturn in recent weeks, Mr. Greenspan has been going out of his way to lay some of the responsibility for the unexpected force of the current swings to the Internet and tools he has long lauded as helping to reshape the economy.
During the headiest days of the 10-year economic expansion, some commentators insisted that the Internet and other information technologies were powering a new economy that would effectively eliminate the boom-and-bust business cycle.
As things began to wobble, that view has given way to a counter-argument that the dot-com bust could drag the rest of the economy down with it, creating what the economist and journalist Michael Mandel calls an "Internet depression."
But what the Fed chairman is suggesting is a middle interpretation, one that acknowledges the overall benefits of Internet-based technologies in business, but which also warns of the risks.
"The faster adjustment process does raise some warning flags," Mr. Greenspan testified last month. Business managers, he said, have access to more information, but everyone often gets similar signals. "As a consequence, firms appear to be acting in far closer alignment with one another than in decades past. The result is not only a faster adjustment, but one that is potentially more synchronized, compressing changes into an even shorter time frame."
With these factors at work, Mr. Greenspan added, the Fed has actually had to work faster and more forcefully to match the new, faster economy. "The Federal Reserve has seen the need to respond more aggressively than had been our wont in earlier decades," he said.
This kind of volatility is showing up on warehouse shelves across the country. And much of it appears to be due to a combination of a widespread bout of "irrational exuberance," with the rise of supposedly turn-on-a-dime businesses that maintain a vast supply chain of other companies that do much of the manufacturing that goes out under the corporate brand.
Cisco is a leader in relying on many less well-known companies to actually manufacture much of the hardware that it sells. Its own plunge in sales has caused havoc for companies like Solectron, the world's largest contract manufacturer of electronics equipment.
Last week, Solectron said that the sharply slowing sales for its customers would force the company, based in Milpitas, Calif., to lower its own profit estimates and to cut 8,000 jobs, about 10 percent of its work force.
Solectron's chief financial officer, Susan S. Wang, said that to a large extent she and other Solectron executives could see the problems coming. After companies had trouble getting the parts they needed in early 2000, those customers ordered far more goods than they could realistically sell, perhaps expecting that even if the market were glutted their own products would beat the competition.
Looking at the orders from each original equipment manufacturer, or O.E.M., and comparing it with those companies' share of the market, Ms. Wang said, Solectron's executives realized: "Gee, if each one of the O.E.M.'s thinks they're going to gain share, we're going to have more than 100 percent share. That doesn't make sense."
Solectron, however, was in a bind. Even though her company tried to warn its customers a year ago that their manufacturing orders were unrealistically optimistic, they did not want to hear bad news.
"If we had said no, they would have told us, 'You're not a good partner for me -- we'll find somebody else,' " she said. "Our only responsible reply was, 'Yes, of course, we'll try.' "
Thus, Ms. Wang said, the effect of a new technology often hinges on the difference between having a powerful tool and the wisdom to use it well. "It's analogous to a child saying, 'I want to learn how to cut down this little tree here.' And you say, 'That's wonderful, I'm going to give you this power saw. It's the best tool.' "
Ultimately, Mr. Greenspan contends, the aspects of new business technology that helped lift productivity and bring about the boom will also help the economy to bounce back more quickly.
That remains to be seen.
Still, even as hopes fade for a V-shaped line on economic charts showing a quick, sharp recovery, supply-chain gurus say that when the recovery finally does begin, the best-networked companies will recover the fastest.
The answer to avoiding a repetition of the current inventory bulge, they insist, is to continue to improve the technologies so that companies can get a better look along their supply chains and eliminate remaining inefficiencies.
That process cannot be complete until manufacturing and delivery come closer to matching the speed at which data zips around the network. But there are inherent limits to how far that can go.
When a manufacturer like Cisco tells its suppliers to stop or slow production, said Jim Sacherman, a vice president at Flextronics, the second-largest contract manufacturer, "it's not that someone didn't get the message to turn it off." The problem is that "those parts had to move around the world for eight weeks, and they're moving."
Ms. Wang of Solectron offers a similar warning. The companies that demand instant response "think we are back-country yokels who are not 'with it.' " But, she added, "in fact, we are the realists who know what is there and what is not there."
In the future, she said she hoped that "our counsel will be better received."
Still, to Ms. Bostrom of Cisco, the silver lining in the current economic clouds is the recognition that in both good times and bad, "the Internet allows the fast to beat the slow."

As a result, they have built up large stocks of unsold goods recently, adding to the overall rise in inventories versus monthly sales.

HEADLINE: U.S. Growth In 4th Quarter Is Cut to 1% 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29 

 BODY:
The economy grew in the fourth quarter at the slowest pace in five and a half years and profits fell for the first time since 1998, revised Commerce Department figures showed today. 
 The gross domestic product expanded at a 1 percent annual pace in the final three months of last year, after a 2.2 percent pace in the third quarter, the report said. 
 A slower buildup in inventories, a decline in auto production and weaker consumer spending led to the slowdown. Business spending on software and equipment fell for the first time in almost 10 years. 
Growth in the first quarter of 2001, now ending, probably slowed to a 0.7 percent rate, according to a preliminary survey of economists. If that forecast turns out to be accurate, growth over the last two quarters will have been the slowest since the 0.1 percent pace in the first half of 1991.
Today's report showed that fourth-quarter growth was slower than the previously estimated 1.1 percent annual pace, mostly because inventories rose less than originally calculated.
The slowing economy has prompted businesses to lay off workers. Still, with unemployment at 4.2 percent, difficulty in finding skilled employees has made some companies reluctant to eliminate too many jobs. That is one reason that first-time claims for unemployment benefits are not rising faster. The Labor Department reported today that first-time claims fell by 20,000 last week, to 362,000, the lowest level in a month. The four-week average for claims, considered a more reliable gauge, fell 3,000, to 374,750.
"This is good news," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at Standard & Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass. Although jobless claims are higher than they were earlier in the year, she said, "the labor market is still pretty good."
The report on the gross domestic product reinforced the view that automakers and other companies have been accumulating inventories at a slowed pace. Business inventories increased at an annual $55.7 billion in the fourth quarter, down from a $72.5 billion pace in the third quarter. Consumer spending grew at a 2.8 percent pace, the slowest since the second quarter of 1997. Spending on durable goods like cars and home appliances fell.
Inflation was little changed. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a gauge watched by Federal Reserve policy makers, rose at a 1.9 percent pace after a 1.8 percent increase in the third quarter.
For all of 2000, according to the revised figures, the economy grew 5 percent, the strongest since 7.3 percent growth in 1984. That followed growth of 4.2 percent in 1999 and 4.4 percent in both 1998 and 1997.

HEADLINE: Triple-Feature to Hong Kong; 
Longest Flight Takes Extra Care (and 3 Tons of Food)

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
When United Airlines Flight 821 rises above the runway at Kennedy International Airport this Sunday morning, it will begin the longest daily nonstop flight in the world, from one side of the globe to the other, New York to Hong Kong.
 The flight is planned at 8,439 miles, edging out the next longest contender, Continental's flight to Hong Kong from Newark, at a mere 8,437 miles. (In fairness, Continental did beat United to the punch, starting its flights on March 1.) 
 To get a United jet weighing 418,000 pounds (and that's when it's empty) all the way from New York to Hong Kong without its touching the ground anywhere in between entails many unusual requirements. Among the most important are these: 
The flight attendants must wear very, very comfortable shoes.
The jet must be the largest one in commercial service -- a 747-400 model -- and it must fly almost directly over the roof of planet Earth, passing close enough to the North Pole to see the elves.
The plane's gas tanks must be topped off, with more than 57,000 gallons of jet fuel, weighing almost as much as the plane itself, about 389,000 pounds. (When it gets to Hong Kong, it is supposed to have only about 5,000 gallons left.)
Fuel must be tested to determine the exact freezing point of the load for each flight. (A typical freezing point, at which the fuel becomes like wax, is about 44 degrees below zero. Near the North Pole, temperatures can drop to 70 below.) The pilots keep an eye on the fuel temperature using an electronic readout in the cockpit. If the plane is approaching what weather forecasters call domes of supercold air, the pilots can speed up the jet to increase the air friction against the fuselage, which prevents the fuel temperature from dropping as fast.
"We literally go blowing right through those domes," said Capt. Bob Whitman, who will be the pilot on Sunday's flight. Chuck Smith, the co-pilot, added, "We don't hang around and enjoy the weather."
United must determine how many passengers and how much cargo it can probably take on each flight, using computers and complex weather forecast models that tell how heavy the plane can be and still make it. United officials expect the passenger load to be somewhere between 270 and 340. "We are the extreme end of the service capacity of these airplanes," said Eugene Cameron, a long-haul flight expert for United. A good thing about the polar routes, which were only recently opened up for commercial flights, is that there are virtually no headwinds near the pole, and turbulence is rare.
Before leaving, the airline must pack in about 7,000 pounds of food and drinks (or 11,000 pounds if meal carts, silverware, plates and other service equipment is included). It must include 2,500 pounds of other amenities, like blankets, pillows and magazines. And 2,700 pounds of water. (Annie Chin-Corio, a flight attendant who will work on the Hong Kong flights, said the airline would probably not need to pack more alcohol than on other long-haul flights because Asian passengers, who will make up a large portion of those taking the flight, usually drink less than Americans and Europeans.)
As the plane approaches the North Pole, the pilots must switch off the automatic pilot and take the controls. This is an extra precaution because even sophisticated navigation gyros must work harder to pinpoint a plane's location near the pole, as longitude and latitude lines converge and all directions become south. 
The planes will not fly directly over the pole, Mr. Cameron said. If they did, he said, "the gyros for a second would say, 'Whoa, where am I?' " United does not want that to happen. As Captain Whitman puts it, "We don't want the plane flying up its own tail."
The airline must pay Russia about $8,000 per flight -- about the price of one and a half one-way first-class tickets, at $5,608 per ticket -- for crossing over Russian airspace.
On most of United's long-haul flights, two movies are shown in economy class. There will be time enough (15 hours, 40 minutes, give or take) for three movies to be shown on the way to Hong Kong. For the first flight on Sunday, which gets into Hong Kong at 2:30 p.m. Monday, the sleepless can watch "Red Planet" with Val Kilmer, "Vertical Limit" with Chris O'Donnell and "102 Dalmatians," with Glenn Close reprising her role as Cruella De Vil.
The pilots and flight attendants must bunk down for the "night" -- actually, the sun will probably dip behind the horizon for only about 45 minutes, depending on the time of year. There will be four pilots, two of whom will spell Captain Whitman and Captain Smith, the first officer, when they duck into a two-bunk dormitory behind the cockpit to get some sleep. Then, the two relief pilots will sleep -- or become what the crew calls "bunkies" -- when Captain Whitman and Captain Smith take over again.
The 18 flight attendants will take turns sleeping in their own dormitory, above the aft galley, where there are six small bunks. The flight attendants must change sheets for the next sleeper. They can bring pajamas if they want to. 
"I sleep like a baby," said Patricia Suhoza, who will work on the Hong Kong route. "It's very cozy."
En route, the pilots must rely on 11 flight charts, the most that Captain Whitman and Captain Smith have ever used. On flights from New York to Tokyo, for example, they generally use four. In the cockpit of a 747-400 the other day, they unfolded one North Pole map to show the route they would take Sunday. They had to point off the map to show where New York and Hong Kong would be.
Because of contractual rules, the pilots who fly the route will end up working only 12 days a month. They will fly from New York to Hong Kong, then from Hong Kong to Singapore, back to Hong Kong and then back to New York, with rest stops between each flight. They will do this route once again and then not fly again until the next month.
Captain Smith stressed that this only sounded like a comfy life. "Boy, when you get back home, you have to hang upside down in the garage for a couple of days before you're normal again," he said. "You don't operate any heavy machinery."
Some things won't change. Captain Whitman and Captain Smith will still be carrying their plastic coke-bottle-lens gag glasses, the ones that make them look like Jerry Lewis in "The Nutty Professor." For a laugh, they like to pull them out of their jackets, put them on and say, "These are our landing glasses."

HEADLINE: Investors Flee U.S. Stock Funds 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29 

 BODY:
Investors pulled $3.07 billion out of United States stock mutual funds in February as stocks sank to two-year lows on a stream of disappointing corporate news, a mutual fund trade group said today. 
 It was the first monthly outflow from stock mutual funds since August 1998, when investors, worried by a financial crisis in Russia, pulled a net $12 billion from stock funds, the trade group, the Investment Company Institute, said. 
 The outlook for March was also gloomy. Stock funds were on track for outflows of as much as $20.9 billion in March, based on activity through March 27, according to an estimate from TrimTabs.com, an investment research Web site. 
A spokeswoman for the mutual fund company Fidelity Investments said outflows from stock funds continued in March. 
If the money continued flowing out of stock funds in March, it will be the industry's worst two-month period since 1990. 
Individual investors also poured more cash into money market funds as they searched for havens amid the stock market turmoil. 
The outflow in February was in contrast to a revised inflow in January of $25.06 billion as the markets rebounded and investors gained a brief sense of optimism. 
In February 2000, before the markets started to decline, investors put a record $53.68 billion into stock funds. 
Stock mutual funds have had positive flows in most months since the summer of 1989. The only exceptions were August 1998 and two months in 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait. 
Money markets stayed in favor in February this year, taking in a net $54.88 billion, down from $103.02 billion in January, with more than half coming from institutional investors.

HEADLINE: FILM IN REVIEW; 
'Butterfly'

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Directed by Doug Wolens
Not rated; 80 minutes
 Is she spiritual kin to Gandhi? Brave sister to Rosa Parks? Or is she simply a rebellious, self-righteous post-adolescent reveling in an outpouring of attention? 
 The 20-something woman in question is Julia Hill, whose Warholian 15 minutes of fame derived from the more than two years she lived in a 6-by-8-foot platform 180 feet high in a Northern California redwood to save the 1,000-year-old tree she called Luna from Pacific Lumber Company loggers.
Like Joan of Arc, she says she hears voices. The tree, she says, speaks to her. Her prayers are answered. Giddy in her rapport with Mother Nature, she is impelled to poetry, and her guitar-plucking supporters celebrate her in folk songs.
Ms. Hill, who acquired the middle name Butterfly, is the subject of Doug Wolens's provocative documentary "Butterfly," which opens today at Cinema Village (22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village). Ms. Hill, whose stubborn crusade inspired vigils, demonstrations and hostility, is not an unalloyed joy.
Even the environmentalists of Earth First, who have long viewed Pacific Lumber's logging practices with a jaundiced eye, regard her as a mixed blessing, valuable for the world of publicity she attracts yet, as she readily admits, beyond the organization's control.
When not focused on Ms. Hill's conducting cell phone interviews, reciting her poetry ("glorious golden sun" and "milk-white mist" are among its descriptions) or prescribing "love, love, love" as the curative for the world's woes, Mr. Wolens's camera visits her supporters and her father, a former Christian evangelical minister. He also trains it on forestry experts, state officials, Pacific Lumber's spokeswoman and some of Humboldt County's homeowners, loggers (some of them unemployed), police officers and townspeople.
Among them are one woman who says of Ms. Hill and her vigil: "It has nothing to do with reality, of living here and what's going on with the lives of people. To hear her talk, she speaks in cosmos speak."
On Dec. 18, 1999, after more than two years in the tree, Ms. Hill and Pacific Lumber reached an agreement establishing a 200-foot buffer zone around Luna to preserve it.
Mr. Wolens's film sheds no light on how this agreement was reached.
While instructive on environmental concerns about the impact of logging, "Butterfly" does not reward those who seek dispassionate psychological insight into the zealous Ms. Hill or lessons that might be applied to mediating and solving some of the world's other prolonged conflicts.

HEADLINE: Europe Central Bank Leaves Rates Unchanged 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 29 

 BODY:
After sending out some of the most muddled signals in its two-year existence, the European Central Bank decided not to reduce interest rates today, and that decision promptly sent Europe's faltering currency back to its lowest level in more than three months.
 The decision by the bank, which sets monetary policy for the 12 nations that have adopted the euro as a common currency, runs counter to moves to lower rates by many other central banks, including the Federal Reserve, in the last few months. 
 Despite clear signs of slowing growth in Europe, especially in Germany, the European Central Bank decided to leave rates where they are for at least the next two weeks. 
The decision did not surprise most economists, who had predicted that the bank would not open the monetary spigot just yet.
Uncertainty about growth and about the central bank's policy has undermined the euro's value against the dollar, even though American economic growth has nearly ground to a halt, while Europe is still expanding at a modest rate.
The euro fell 0.5 percent, to 88.2 cents today, its lowest level since mid-December. Though many analysts expected it to climb this year, it has lost 6 percent of its value since New Year's Day.
Contradictory signals from officials of the bank added to the uncertainty.
Otmar Issing, the bank's chief economist, startled many investors late last week when he said Europe's economy had "significantly clouded over" and would probably not achieve the central bank's forecast of 3 percent annual growth. And Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the Bank of France and widely expected to become the European Central Bank's next president, said the central bank was much less worried about inflation than it had been a few months ago.
Together, these remarks hinted at a change in thinking at the bank, whose officials had been insisting that European growth would remain "robust" and was not in need of any extra support from easier money.
But almost as soon as Mr. Issing and Mr. Trichet had spoken, other central bankers began sending out a decidedly more hawkish message. Ernst Welteke, president of the Bundesbank in Germany and a governor of the European Central Bank, said last Friday that it was "not the time to speculate about changes" and warned against making any hasty decisions.
Because the European Central Bank is governed by central bankers from each of the euro countries, cacophony has been a problem before. And the bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, has been criticized for making confusing statements that seemed to cut in different directions at the same time.
But economists say the bank also faces an unusually puzzling environment. The two biggest national economies, the United States and Japan, have both stalled badly, which will inevitably act as a brake on European growth. But many European countries are still expanding at a respectable rate, and inflation is still running above the central bank's self-imposed ceiling of 2 percent a year.
Private economists predict that over all, Europe will grow about 2 percent or a little more this year, a much slower pace than in 2000 but faster than what is expected in the United States.
Economists now predict that the European Central Bank will reduce rates at its next meeting, scheduled for April 13.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
And When He Was Bad, He Certainly Was Busy

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
"Neil Jenney: The Bad Years, 1969-70," at the Gagosian Gallery uptown, is an outstanding exhibition whose title invites a snappy retort: Both of them? Still, in those two years Mr. Jenney helped put representational painting on a new course and established precedents for the art of the 1970's, 80's and 90's in ways that have yet to be fully recognized.
 This show may change that. It brings together more of his "bad" paintings than ever before, including several that have never been exhibited. It is his first New York gallery show in a dozen years. 
 Its title almost reads as a deflationary dig at art-show pretension, a joke made on purpose. After all, the paintings are jokes that work really well, which means that they have their own kind of depth.
Who is or was Neil Jenney? A precocious, largely self-taught abstract painter, he arrived in New York from Boston in December 1966 and rapidly developed into one of the art world's most independent and reclusive stars, known for playing hardball during his off hours (in a city league) and for refusing gallery representation.
In the late 1960's and 70's Mr. Jenney became a kind of artistic pace car, a little ahead of the pack but also outside the action in a lane of his own. By 1967, when he was just 22, he was making soft Process Art sculptures and appearing in some of the first exhibitions of the related tendencies -- Process, Conceptual and Body Art -- that came to be called Post-Minimalism. These included "Earth Art" at Cornell University, "When Attitude Becomes Form" at the Kunsthaus in Zurich and "Anti-Illusion: Procedures/Materials" at the Whitney Museum of American Art, all in 1969. 
Yet by then Mr. Jenney had moved on, and he revealed where in his first appearance in a Whitney Biennial, also in 1969: to vaguely representational paintings notable for their haphazard execution and deadpan plays on words and images. Buster Keaton could not have been more droll.
"Fish and Pole," Mr. Jenney's contribution to the 1969 Whitney Biennial, is the first painting at Gagosian, followed by no fewer than 20 like-minded works. The canvas shows a large sketchily painted fish and a broken fishing rod lying in a field of slurred green brush strokes that read as grass. Its title is painted like a punch line in plain white letters across the bottom of its plain black frame. Its buzzy closed circuit of language and image, object and painting can still make you laugh, and then think twice. 
The painting's title pulls apart a familiar phrase: not fishing pole but fish and pole. The resulting two objects evoke an age-old conflict between man and nature in which neither completely wins. We glimpse this inner tension and then glide back to the once-over-lightly surface where paint, image, frame and concept all have an equal weight, one that is light and built for speed.
In the subsequent paintings the light and speed become a bit monotonous, a well-executed schtick. But the best works bounce the viewer back and forth between surface and depth. The subdivided cliches of their titles frame the seemingly banal images with hints of dark thoughts and irreconcilable differences: conflicts between world powers, men and women, art and society, humans and nature.
"Them and Us" shows two jets, one with the insignia of the United States, the other with that of the Soviet Union, flying side by side on a surface of drippy blue. "Brushed and Broomed" compares the results of a freshly wielded paintbrush and broom: contrasting a pile of dust with some red brush strokes on the wall, not intended to overjoy whoever is cleaning up. "Here and There," a widely reproduced work, is nothing but a crisp white fence, a worldly descendant of the Minimalist grid, dividing the greensward in half. "Trees and Lumber" shows several rows of a pine forest; the trees on the left are standing, and those on the right are identical to them except that they have been cut down.
Made at a time when most young artists were avoiding either representation or painting, Mr. Jenney embraced both and put them together in a new way. It was immediately identifiable as post-Pop; today it also looks Post-Conceptual, and ahead of its time. In the thick of the Conceptualist moment, he pronounced painting not only viable but also capable of absorbing all the non- or anti-painting strategies around it.
He wasn't alone. Joe Zucker, Chuck Close and Jennifer Bartlett had a similar process-oriented approach, which broke down painted images into their component parts and procedures. Some of Ree Morton's work had a similar objectness. And William Wegman was combining words and image with flat-footed American humor. 
But in doing all these things at once, Mr. Jenney may have been unmatched. In 1978 Marcia Tucker, who had organized the Whitney's "Anti-Illusion" exhibition, built a show called " 'Bad' Painting" around his 1969-70 paintings, along with the work of Joan Brown, William N. Copley and Mr. Wegman, at the fledgling New Museum of Contemporary Art. The same year Richard Marshall included them in "New Image Painting," a largely forgotten trendlet that preceded American Neo-Expressionism. 
By then Mr. Jenney was otherwise engaged. In 1971 he began developing a painstaking hyperrealism that both built on and contradicted his "bad" paintings. The Gagosian show finishes with three of these works as well as some fairly lame canvases silk-screened with aphorisms, which are best taken as oblique artist's statements. "Style Is Technique Plus Symbolism," begins the most pertinent. 
The paintings' titled black frames, now thickened and elaborately customized to the point of seeming bunkerlike, persist. Not surprisingly, nature is a dominant theme. "Atmosphere" (1984-92) and "Morning" (1996) are gorgeous skylike monochromes, modernist additions to Hudson River School painting.
The most interesting work, and a new one, is "North America Divided" (1992-99), which shows the sheared surface of a large tree stump seen through the top of a rickety split-rail gate and a bit of corroded electric fence. In it Mr. Jenney seems to retrieve some of his "bad" painting's surface weirdness and inner tensions. The realism is almost northern European in its perfection, but the forms are all carefully textured, minutely sculptural, oddly American.
In front of this dour yet exquisite painting, the Civil War, manifest destiny and the cost of human progress flicker across the brain. So does the question of how long it will be before Mr. Jenney shows new work again.
"Neil Jenney: The 'Bad' Years, 1969-70" is at the Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, through April 13.

HEADLINE: Bush and Brazil Chief Have Politics, if Not Trade, to Discuss 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 29 

 BODY:
With Brazil and the United States at odds as always on trade issues but increasingly driven together by growing political instability in South America, President Bush and his Brazilian counterpart, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, will meet for the first time on Friday in Washington. 
 The meeting is clearly more than just a get-acquainted session between the presidents of the Western Hemisphere's most populous nations. It will find "the two major figures in any free trade area of the Americas trying to put their heads together in advance" of a 35-country summit of hemispheric heads of state, said Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. The summit is to be held in Quebec April 20-22. 
 A hemispheric free-trade agreement was proposed by President Clinton in December 1994 but languished when Congress would not grant him the full negotiating authority he wanted. There has been a burst of activity in recent months, including American suggestions that the deadline for an accord be moved up to 2003 from 2005, but in a recent interview Mr. Cardoso made it clear that Brazil, the key to the talks, would not be stampeded.
"The problem is not the date, it's the content of the negotiations," he said. "Let's be clear," he went on: "The big market for the United States is Brazil, and we know that. The big market for us is the United States, and they know that. So we have more problems and themes to negotiate" than smaller countries. 
For a Republican administration with close ties to business groups hungry for new international markets, the stakes are especially high. As noted in a study published last month by the Council on Foreign Relations, "Brazil's economy is more than twice as large as Russia's, almost as large as China's, and twice India's." 
Since Mr. Bush took office, the Brazilian press has been full of concerns that his years as governor of Texas and his lack of experience in foreign affairs would lead him to value relations with Mexico at Brazil's expense. The fact that the United States has had an ambassador here only 13 of the past 32 months has been interpreted as proof that Washington does not regard this nation of 170 million people as serious or important. 
Mr. Cardoso minimized his countrymen's concerns about the United States' southern neighbor, saying "I don't see Mexico as a threat or a rival" in gaining Washington's ear. But his government clearly wants the new team in the White House "to begin paying attention to this monster country," as Kenneth Maxwell, director of the Brazil project at the Council on Foreign Relations, put it.
The policy memorandum written by the Council on Foreign Relations task force urged the Bush administration to move swiftly to establish a "strategic dialogue" with the Cardoso government. 
"Brazil is the fulcrum" of all of Latin America, the study maintained, not just because of its importance in the trade talks but also because "around Brazil, much is coming unglued." 
The document, prepared by a group of academic and business leaders, noted that "both the United States and Brazil face an escalating crisis in Colombia, instability in the Andean region, and an increasingly complicated relationship with Venezuela" and its tempestuous leftist president, Hugo Chavez. In that sense, Washington has begun looking to Brazil as both a moderating force and a potential ally in the region.
But Brazilians were concerned when Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, during his confirmation hearings, suggested that he favored more of a regional effort to contain the Colombian conflict. 
Mr. Cardoso said Brazil supports the Colombian president Andres Pastrana's Plan Colombia, including the American military aid that has been criticized by European powers and some of Colombia's other neighbors. "The Colombian state is in crisis and needs to be reinforced," Mr. Cardoso said.
But he expressed reservations about any deeper American involvement in the Colombian conflict. "It depends on the form the growth would take, and its purpose," he said. "I think it would be a mistake" for the United States to send troops, he said, adding that "I think that the American people should be more worried about that than me."
Mr. Cardoso, a sociologist who has written many books and speaks four languages, developed a close relationship with Mr. Clinton. But he said he does not expect his background as a left-leaning intellectual to impede his getting along with Mr. Bush. 
"He has a certain simplicity that I think is good," Mr. Cardoso said. "He talks easily to people and isn't formal, and that helps create a sensibility that goes beyond ideological experiences."

HEADLINE: Vallone Battles Critics Over His Budget Proposal 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone took hits from all sides yesterday, as one of his Democratic rivals in the mayor's race, the Giuliani administration and a budget watchdog group criticized his $39.2 billion city budget plan, saying it relied on dangerously optimistic revenue projections.
 The chorus of criticism reflected both the intensifying political campaign and the lingering doubts about the capacity of the New York City economy to sustain itself as a slowdown takes hold across much of the nation. 
 Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, who in his seven years in office has rarely commented on the Council's budget plan, started off the pile-on yesterday, saying the 2002 fiscal year proposal that Mr. Vallone unveiled on Wednesday was "egregious." 
"It presents an unreasonably rosy picture," said Mr. Hevesi, one of four Democrats running for mayor.
Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota described the Council's budget as appearing to come from some "mythological world," in which the city somehow generates $556 million in extra tax revenues in 2002 above what Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani projected in January.
Mr. Vallone issued a statement defending his proposal against the criticism, which one of his aides described as purely political.
"For the last 10 years, the Council's budget plan has been fiscally prudent and responsible, and this year it is exceptionally so," Mr. Vallone said.
The Council budget package serves as an alternative to the plan introduced in January by Mr. Giuliani. The Council plan proposes restoring $155 million in cuts Mr. Giuliani advocated for libraries, parks, cultural institutions and other programs, and includes $548 million more for schools and $119 million in other new spending. The extra spending is possible, according to Mr. Vallone's plan, because of higher projected revenues, as well as some cuts in the mayor's budget, among other changes.
So disturbed was Mr. Vallone's staff about the criticism that late yesterday his aides toured Room 9, where the City Hall reporters work, showing them old budget estimates by Mr. Hevesi that had proved to be excessively pessimistic. "The sky is falling, the sky is falling," one aide said, mocking the comptroller.
Mr. Hevesi repeatedly asserted that his criticism of the Council budget -- he did not call it Mr. Vallone's budget -- was not politically motivated. And he said that even though the Council's revenue estimates may have proved accurate in the 1990's, that might not be the case during an economic downturn.
Officials from the Citizens Budget Commission took the comptroller's side. "The Vallone proposal is increasing spending at a time when we are encouraging more prudence," said Charles Brecher, research director at the commission.

HEADLINE: A More Assertive Europe 

 BODY:
Yesterday was a timely moment for President Bush to meet with Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder. Only a day earlier, the White House announced its ill-advised rejection of the Kyoto treaty on global warming, upsetting Germany and other European countries where climate change is a passionate political issue. Mr. Schroder urged Mr. Bush to cooperate with countries that want to work within the treaty at a conference to be held in Bonn later this year. 
 Germany and many of its European Union partners have gained a new sense of confidence on the world stage, built on Europe's improving economy and its growing political and commercial integration. Mr. Schroder epitomizes this new independence.
 Europe may seem like familiar territory to Bush administration officials, many of whom dealt with the continent during the cold war years when European leaders were more deferential to Washington's wishes than they are now. Administration policy makers must adjust their thinking to Europe's new mood or risk conflicts over the environment, arms control, NATO and trade.
The Kyoto treaty, which calls for sharp reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide by 2012, is a good example. While the treaty is imperfect, and the Senate has been opposed to ratification, the issue is far too important for Washington simply to walk off in a huff. The Bush administration should try to improve the treaty, not kill it. America is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Mr. Bush should heed Mr. Schroder's pleas for faster emissions cuts.
Europe is also concerned that the administration's missile defense plans could overturn arms control agreements and unnecessarily increase tensions with Russia. Germany, in particular, wants to prevent a return to a cold war atmosphere in Europe. With Washington's antimissile plans still evolving, it was possible to defer open disagreement this week. But the administration should respond to European concerns by engaging in active diplomacy with Russia, and China, on this issue in the months ahead. 
Europe's new assertiveness can help advance American policy goals, as demonstrated by this week's constructive mission to Macedonia by Europe's top foreign policy official, Javier Solana. But careful diplomatic coordination will be needed to keep trans-Atlantic relations on track.

HEADLINE: At Iraq's Backdoor, Turkey Flouts Sanctions 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: HABUR, Turkey 

 BODY:
Deep in the dusty southeastern corner of Turkey, closer to Baghdad than to Istanbul, a line of 200 aging tanker trucks stretches for half a mile along the highway as drivers wait to unload Iraqi diesel fuel at a depot run by the Turkish government.
 The trucks are returning from Iraq with full tanks on the last leg of a journey that openly flouts the United Nations economic embargo against Baghdad. It is sanctions-busting smuggling regulated and taxed by the Turkish government and tolerated by the United Nations and the United States. 
 Estimates on the volume of Iraqi oil and diesel fuel passing through Habur Gate, the only legal crossing between Iraq and Turkey, range from $300 million to $600 million a year. Western diplomats calculate that the illicit business puts $120 million a year in the pocket of President Saddam Hussein. 
"This trade is outside the sanctions system," said a senior Turkish government official, who spoke on the condition his name not be used. "But I would say it is indispensable for Turkey, and we are sensitive not to allow it to help Iraq acquire weapons of mass destruction."
There is, however, no way to monitor what Iraq does with the revenue.
Western diplomats say the trade has increased as oil prices have climbed. They justify turning a blind eye because the money helps the battered economy in this volatile region of Turkey, an important American ally. The trade also is the chief source of income for northern Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party, which opposes Mr. Hussein.
Because of the political considerations, the smuggling continues and underscores a quandary confronting the Bush administration as it shapes its sanctions policy.
The United States and Britain have been under pressure from other members of the United Nations Security Council to ease the sanctions. One contention is that the borders are porous anyway; experts say illegal goods and oil flow overland from Jordan and Syria and by boats in the Persian Gulf. Another argument is that the sanctions have inflicted the most damage on the Iraqi people and neighboring countries. 
Turkey has been hard hit by the embargo. Iraq was not only a major trading partner, but also a conduit for getting Turkish agricultural products into the Middle East. Turkish officials say the embargo has cost the economy $35 billion to $40 billion, and the country's current economic crisis has increased pressure to expand trade with Iraq.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is trying to develop sanctions that will allow more consumer goods into Iraq and tighten the rein on Mr. Hussein's ability to buy weapons. But any attempt to loosen controls is likely to face opposition from hard-liners at the Pentagon and conservative Republicans in Congress.
Edward S. Walker Jr., assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs, traveled to Ankara this month to assure Turkish officials that the administration is studying ways to reduce the impact of sanctions on Iraq's neighbors. "It's going to mean that we're going to have to change the way we deal with the border," Mr. Walker said.
Iraq is allowed to sell oil under United Nations supervision only through a pipeline to Ceyhan on Turkey's Mediterranean coast, and by ship through Mina al Bakr, a Persian Gulf port. Proceeds go into an account administered by the United Nations to buy food, medicine and other goods and pay war reparations.
To gain more control over its oil revenues, Iraq has been sending oil through an unauthorized pipeline to Syria. It also increased sales of low-grade fuel oil and diesel fuel to the truckers who ply their trade through Habur Gate.
Turkish and Western government officials as well as truckers said the oil and diesel fuel were sold by Iraq to the Kurdistan Peoples Party, despite its opposition to Baghdad. The party is an independent force that controls the border on the Iraqi side.
Masoud Barzani, the head of the Kurdish party, marks up the price, adds a tax and resells it to truckers. The revenue helps Mr. Barzani cement his control over the border area and makes it relatively prosperous, diplomats said.
A 31-year-old Turkish truck driver said he paid 14 cents a liter for diesel fuel in Iraq, including a 2-cent tax. He said he often waited at least three days to load because the lines were so long. 
Once loaded, truckers said, 2,000 or more trucks are often lined up at the border because Turkey allows only 450 tankers a day back into the country. Turkish officials said the limit was necessary so trucks can be inspected for other smuggling.
The volume of tankers remains far below pre-embargo levels, and the landscape is dotted with thousands of rusting tankers, described by an official as "martyrs to the embargo." Officials estimate that 40,000 to 50,000 trucks now haul oil and diesel fuel from Iraq into Turkey. 
By 1999, the illegal trade accounted for a quarter of Turkey's diesel fuel consumption, and that was when the government stepped in to institutionalize the smuggling with new regulations. Truckers who had made at least a trip a month were limited to one every three months. Instead of selling diesel fuel on the open market, they were required to unload at the government depot in nearby Silopi and pay taxes.
The government profited two ways -- by taxing the fuel and reselling it to distributors at a higher price. The depot collected $74 million in taxes in its first four months in late 1999, but officials said more recent figures were not available.
Customs inspections were also toughened. The diesel fuel or oil is weighed and tested and matched against a computerized list to make sure that the driver has not exceeded the allotted number of trips. Empty tankers and trucks hauling goods to Iraq also are inspected to make sure any Iraq-bound material complies with the sanctions.
"With our controls, it is almost impossible to get anything through," Abdullah Erin, the deputy governor who runs the customs gate, said as he strolled through a lot filled with trucks awaiting examination.
Mr. Erin and Huseyin Baskaya, the provincial governor, insisted that the trade operated within United Nations sanctions. Mr. Baskaya even said he was establishing a company to take part in the business, with profits earmarked for civic projects.
It is fiction. A senior Turkish official in Ankara acknowledged that the trade was outside the sanctions, though he defended its economic necessity.
The truckers chafe at the restrictions and taxes. They can earn $2,000 to $3,000 a year, a good income in the southeast, but it often must support several large families.
Any relaxation of sanctions would be welcomed in the region, where unemployment exceeds 60 percent. After years of civil war between the Turkish government and Kurdish separatists and the effects of the embargo, the biggest hope many see is opening the border, something unlikely to happen in the near future.
"Turkey is a loyal friend of the United States, and absolutely the embargo should be lifted so we can begin to make a living," said Kutbettin Arzu, an official with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Diyarbakir, the regional capital. 
In the meantime, the line of trucks continues to run from Iraq to the Turkish depot in Silopi.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 9, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on March 30 about the smuggling of oil from Iraq to Turkey in violation of United Nations sanctions referred incorrectly in one passage to the Kurdish political party in Iraq, headed by Masoud Barzani, which resells oil and fuel that it buys from the Iraqi government. As noted elsewhere in the article, it is the Kurdistan Democratic Party, not the Kurdistan Peoples Party.

HEADLINE: SENATE CLEARS LAST HURDLE FOR BILL ON SOFT-MONEY BAN; FINAL VOTE SET FOR MONDAY 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29 

 BODY:
The Senate today defeated the last major challenge to the effort to ban unrestricted contributions to the political parties, clearing the way for passage of comprehensive campaign finance legislation.
 The outcome of the two-week debate became clear this afternoon when the Senate, by a vote of 57 to 43, rebuffed an effort that would have undermined much of the bill if the Supreme Court struck down any part of it. 
 Even after fighting back challenge after challenge, Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, had called this amendment the most serious threat to their effort to limit money in politics. They said it was intended to sabotage the centerpiece of their bill, the ban on the donations known as soft money that reached a record of nearly $500 million in the last election.
"Have no doubt about what this vote is really about," Mr. McCain said minutes before the vote. "If you vote for this amendment, you are voting for soft money. That is really what this vote is all about." 
Mr. McCain, who has been fighting his party leaders for years on this issue, started to smile midway through the roll call. Many Democrats who had been said to be wavering were voting with him, and he was picking up unexpected Republican votes. Thirteen Republicans joined 44 Democrats to defeat the amendment. 
Senate debate was to continue on Friday on minor amendments, and a final vote on the bill was put off until Monday, in part because a delegation of senators concerned with energy policy had a trip planned to Alaska. But the bill's passage was now considered assured. Even Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who has been fighting such legislation for more than a decade, conceded defeat. 
"There's nobody to come to the rescue," Mr. McConnell said. "This train is moving down the track." He said he would concentrate on putting together a court challenge, in case the bill passed the House and was signed into law. 
Senator Thad Cochran, a Mississippi Republican who joined forces with Mr. McCain this year, said, "I'm confident that we are on the way to victory." 
At the White House earlier in the day, President Bush, who had criticized Mr. McCain's plan in their Republican primary battle last year, declined to say whether he would sign a bill that banned soft money.
"This is a bill in progress," Mr. Bush said. "It's a bill that continues to change. And I'll take a look at it when it makes my desk. And if it improves the system, I'll sign it. I look forward to signing a good piece of legislation."
He added, "I appreciate the hard work that's being done on the legislation." Mr. Bush had called for a ban on such donations by unions and corporations but not by individuals.
The bill under consideration by the Senate would amount to the most comprehensive change to the campaign finance law since the Watergate era. It would ban the unregulated donations by unions, corporations and individuals to the political parties known as soft money.
The bill would also restrict issue advertising by unions, corporations and many single issue groups in the 60 days before a general election and the 30 days before a primary.
And for the first time since 1974, it would raise the limits on regulated contributions to candidates and parties. Individuals would be allowed to give $2,000 to a candidate per election and a cumulative total of $37,500 a year to all federal candidates and parties. The numbers would rise with inflation. Candidates running against millionaires putting their own wealth into their campaigns would be given more leeway.
For five years, the effort to ban soft money has died in Republican-led Senate filibusters. But Senators said that the politics had changed for several reasons. In part, they said the McCain-Feingold bill was being propelled forward because Democrats, who have long provided the most votes for it, picked up seats, leaving the Senate divided 50-50. They also credited Mr. McCain with giving the issue new prominence during his presidential campaign.
Moreover in the 2000 election the parties broke nearly even in soft money fund-raising, making some Republicans willing to take a second look at the system. And Senator Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican who was a supporter of Mr. McCain, said Mr. Bush's position in favor of some soft money donations but not others, also helped Mr. McCain pick up support. "People asked themselves, am I going to storm the Bastille over protecting individual soft money?" Mr. Thompson said.
Senators also credited Senator Tom Daschle, the minority leader from South Dakota, with working hard to keep most members of his party supporting a bill they had long voted for when they had been certain the Republicans would kill it. "I have done everything I know how to do to work with my caucus," Mr. Daschle said in midmorning, still uncertain how many Democrats would vote for the amendment tying the bill's major provisions together for court scrutiny.
This afternoon's debate on that provision was as pointed as any on the issue in the last two weeks. Lawmakers sparred over judicial restraint and the balance of powers, and quoted everyone from Alexander Hamilton to Mark Twain to Justice John Paul Stevens when he wrote a stinging dissent in the case that ended the ppresidential standoff in Florida last year.
The supporters of the provision -- including several Democrats who broke publicly with their party -- said the need for it was amply demonstrated by what happened when Congress approved the last comprehensive campaign finance law in 1974 only to see the Supreme Court strike down many of its components.
The result was that the law's limits on campaign spending were overthrown -- allowing campaign costs to escalate -- but its $1,000 limits on contributions to candidates remained in place.
"Here's the most remarkable thing about the campaign finance system in the United States," Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, said. "No one ever proposed it. No one ever wrote it and no one ever voted for it. Because the Supreme Court wrote it."
He said that the Senate in the last two weeks had unexpectedly created a comprehensive measure -- amendment by amendment -- covering parties, candidates and outside groups that should rise and fall together. "These are a series of overriding reforms inextricably dependent on each other," Mr. Torricelli said. "If one or more are removed the nation will have a radically different campaign finance system."
Mr. Thompson reminded the Senate that Congress had been reacting to revelations of campaign finance abuses in 1974 and suggested it would still have enacted strict contribution limits even if it had foreseen that the court would strike down its spending limits.
"Would they have raised the ceiling on contributions?" Mr. Thompson asked. "I don't think so. What they were doing was in response to Watergate."
He called such provisions highly unusual, saying that only one bill that had passed Congress in the last 12 years had contained such a clause.
Senator Bill Frist, the Tennessee Republican who proposed the amendment, said he feared a situation in which the bill's issue advertisement restriction on outside groups would be struck down by the court as an infringement of free speech rights leaving them free to run advertisements against candidates, while the political parties would still be banned from raising soft money.
He called the parts of the bill "complementary," adding, "They're intertwined."
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, insisted that the amendment had one purpose, "It is aimed at the soft money ban, which is the heart and soul of this bill."

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Raising His Megaphone, Bush Says, I'm in Charge

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29 

 BODY:
At his White House news conference today, the president put forward the persona of the jocular Bush, ribbing a television news reporter for a salary that was undoubtedly in "the top 1 percent." He presented the self-deprecating Bush, making fun of his own tendency to mispronounce words.
 But perhaps most important, he promoted the image of the engaged Bush, who was not merely a detached witness to the campaign finance debate in the Senate or the bloodshed in the Middle East, but rather a leader with a role in these events, opinions about them and a lot more on his mind and his plate. 
 After several weeks in which President Bush was at times an almost peripheral figure in the news of the day, which veered in directions different than his administration desired, he seemed to be trying to take both center stage and control. Some political analysts said that the news conference was interestingly timed. 
"John McCain has dominated the news for two full weeks," noted Scott Reed, a Republican strategist here, referring to campaign finance, an issue that was not one of the administration's priorities. "The economy has slowed down. Next week is a big week in the Senate with the budget resolution. Now's when you have to have all 12 cylinders pumping."
Kenneth M. Duberstein, the former chief of staff in the Reagan White House, offered a similar assessment.
"Bush is staying focused on the economy and tax cuts on a day when the Senate is considering campaign finance reform," Mr. Duberstein said, noting that the president's "megaphone is bigger than anybody else's -- including 100 senators."
But Mr. Bush is not always quick to use it, and just as his first news conference followed a period of time when another politician, former President Clinton, was getting more coverage than he was, this White House news conference -- Mr. Bush's second -- followed a period of dominance by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. 
Mr. Bush's news conference also came at a time of growing apprehensions about the economy, reflected in several recent polls by Republican officials and independent organizations that showed either signs of jitters in the electorate or possible seeds of doubt about Mr. Bush.
Administration officials said that they and Mr. Bush had started talking late last week about having a news conference late this week, and that it fit within their general goal of having at least one every month.
"The president wants to be accessible to the press, and there are a lot of issues right now that the press had not had a chance to talk to the president about," said Karen P. Hughes, the counselor to the president.
Those included campaign finance, the Middle East, carbon dioxide emissions and reports of tension with Mr. McCain, and as Mr. Bush took an array of questions about these predictable topics, it seemed as if he was trying to quiet all the extraneous noise, so that Americans would better hear his pitch for his tax cut.
It was telling that he opened his news conference by drawing attention to a House vote on Wednesday in favor of his budget resolution, a development that was crucial to the passage of his tax plan, but that was given only limited attention.
"He's used his megaphone very well to sell his tax cut on the road," said Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist who talks frequently with administration officials. "It's helpful, when he's back here in town, to use it here as well."
And so he did, in a merry-cum-mischievous manner that may not be conventionally presidential but is quintessentially Bush, a part of the upbeat, unfussy, informal aura he relishes. As he did last month, he held the news conference not in the gilded East Room but in the press briefing room, a less stilted setting.
And he cracked jokes. "Those who think that they can say, 'We're only going to have a stimulus package, but let's forget tax relief,' misunderestimate -- or excuse me -- underestimate," Mr. Bush said.
"Just making sure you were paying attention," he laughed.
(Mr. Bush continued his recent habit of poking such generous fun at himself at a dinner tonight for television and radio correspondents, where he read aloud from a book that catalogued his most ridiculous and comical misstatements.)
During the press conference, he told a reporter with a raised hand that of the remaining two people who would get to ask questions before the end, the reporter would be "next to next. Let me rephrase that -- you're last."
And when a beeper went off, he did not repeat his reaction last week when the ringing of a reporter's cell phone interrupted his remarks and he gently chastised an aide for failing to patrol the situation. (Mr. Bush abhors such aural intrusions.)
He simply said, with a smile: "Don't worry about the beeper violation. It's a new approach."
Today's news conference was all about adjustments -- in what reporters were focusing on, in what people were perceiving or misperceiving about the president's intentions, positions or degrees of involvement. Mr. Bush was fine-tuning, and he was trying to be nimble about it.

HEADLINE: Delta Pilots Reject Offer Of Arbitration 

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The union representing the pilots at Delta Air Lines rejected an offer of arbitration from federal mediators yesterday, setting in motion the 30-day cooling-off period required before a strike.
 Unless the two sides reach a tentative agreement or the White House intervenes, Delta's 9,800 pilots will be free to walk off the job at 12:01 a.m. on April 29, grounding the airline. 
 The escalating threat of a strike comes after 1,350 pilots at Comair, which is a commuter airline owned by Delta, walked out on Monday, shutting down that airline.
Both the pilots union and Delta management looked to the White House yesterday to see what action President Bush might take. Earlier this month, Mr. Bush issued an executive order delaying a strike by mechanics at Northwest Airlines and said that he would take the necessary steps to prevent any airline strike this year. 
But last week White House officials said that the president could intervene only if he received a request from the National Mediation Board, which governs labor relations in the airline and rail industries.
Magdalena G. Jacobsen, the board member in charge of the Delta negotiations, said in an interview yesterday that the board had advised the White House of developments in the negotiations but did not request a presidential emergency board, which would delay a strike by 60 days.
"Once you move the process along to where the pressure is building, you don't really want to vent it until the right time," Ms. Jacobsen said. "We want to allow the parties to come to an agreement themselves."
In a statement yesterday, the mediation board asked both the union and Delta to meet on April 16 to resume negotiations.
A White House spokeswoman said that Mr. Bush had urged the parties to work constructively to resolve their differences. Under the Railway Labor Act, the president can appoint an emergency board if a strike threatens to disrupt the economy of any part of the country. If the White House acts, a strike is delayed by 60 days while the board holds hearings and makes a settlement recommendation. If neither side accepts the recommendation, the union can strike or Congress can step in to impose a resolution. 
Mr. Bush's appointment of an emergency board in Northwest's negotiations with its mechanics was only the second time since 1966 that such a step had been taken. President Bill Clinton appointed an emergency board in 1997 after pilots at American Airlines went on strike. But he did not step in when pilots at Northwest walked out the following year.
Both the leader of the Air Line Pilots Association and Delta management expressed optimism that a new contact could be reached before the strike deadline. Last week, Delta had accepted the mediation board's offer of arbitration.
"While we are disappointed A.L.P.A. did not accept arbitration," said Thomas J. Slocum, Delta's senior vice president for corporate communications, "we are committed to working toward a settlement."
The two sides have been negotiating for 19 months and remain divided on several critical issues, including pay, retirement and job security. 
Delta's pilots accepted pay and work rule concessions in their current contract, which was signed in 1996, a time when the airline industry was beginning to recover from one of the worst downturns in its history. Since then, many airlines, including Delta, have earned record profits. 
Now the industry is facing tougher times again as economic growth slows and corporations trim travel budgets, but the pilots are determined to receive the pay and benefits they feel they have earned over the last five years.
Delta managers have said that they are willing to make the pilots the highest paid in the industry but they want to link any pay increases to gains in productivity.
Delta is probably losing $1 million to $1.5 million in after-tax earnings each day because of the Comair strike, Michael Linenberg, an airline analyst at Merrill Lynch, told Reuters yesterday.
The Cincinnati-based Comair, which normally flies 25,000 passengers a day under the name Delta Connection, has managed to rebook many of its customers on other airlines, including Delta. A walkout by Delta's pilots would be much more costly and strand thousands of passengers in the Southeast, where Delta is by far the dominant airline. 
On Wednesday, Comair canceled all its flights through next Thursday morning to allow its passengers an opportunity to make alternate plans. Yesterday, the airline appealed to its pilots to agree to arbitration in a bid to settle the strike. But the pilots rejected the offer, saying they would rather settle their differences through negotiations.

HEADLINE: French Insurer Seeks German Bank Partner 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
AXA, the big French insurer, is in talks with Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, on a far-reaching alliance under which the bank would sell AXA's insurance and mutual fund offerings at its branches throughout Europe, the chief executive of AXA said yesterday.
 Such an alliance would match the strategy, if not the form, of the proposed purchase by Allianz, AXA's chief European rival, of Dresdner Bank, the third-largest in Germany. Allianz confirmed yesterday that it was in talks with Dresdner. 
 Insurance analysts in Europe and the United States said that the Allianz-Dresdner combination threatened to put intense pressure on AXA to find an equivalent sales network in Germany, a vital market. But Henri de Castries, the youthful chief executive of AXA, said the company had no interest in buying a bank outright, as Allianz plans to do.
"We don't think we need to own a bank," he said in an interview at the New York headquarters of AXA Financial, where he was attending a meeting. "We would like to have agreements with banks to distribute each other's products."
Mr. de Castries, who has been running AXA for nearly a year, said it was far from certain that AXA and Deutsche Bank would strike a deal. But he spoke glowingly of Deutsche Bank's "wonderful strength" and "potential to be a good partner."
The AXA-Deutsche Bank talks began recently, but Mr. de Castries would not say just when. 
Mr. de Castries said AXA, with $451 billion in assets, is probably not going to make any acquisitions in the next year or so; instead, it will concentrate on consolidating and improving what it bought in the last few years. Still, he said, if the right insurance company or brokerage house or group of financial planners became available in the United States -- or elsewhere -- at the right price, AXA would jump at it, he said.
Despite strongly negative reaction from investors to the most recent cross-border deal involving an American financial company -- the agreement by Prudential P.L.C. of Britain to buy American General of Houston -- Mr. de Castries said big European insurers were not likely to be discouraged from seeking such deals.
For starters, high valuations in Europe make American insurers look cheap, he said. Moreover, he said, "if you want to be a global player, you have to have a significant presence in the U.S. market."
One difficulty with deals like Prudential-American General or AXA's purchase of Sanford C. Bernstein last June is that some American institutional investors are prohibited from holding foreign stocks, and many others simply do not want them; they tend to sell immediately when a deal is announced. 
Mr. de Castries said "short-term turbulence" in the United States might inhibit some potential buyers, but that in the long run, "the way American financial services operate is attractive; the margins are good and the growth prospects are good."
Even an economic downturn could be good news for sellers of mutual funds, annuities and financial advice like AXA, Mr. de Castries said. "People will understand better the necessity of being well advised," he said. "And if people feel less rich, they will have a tendency to save more."

 BODY:
House Approves Elements Of Bush's Tax-Cut Proposal
Despite uncertain prospects in the Senate, the House of Representatives approved two more elements of President Bush's tax-cut plan and took the first tentative step toward eventually abolishing the estate tax.
 The House passed a bill that would lower income taxes for married couples and double the tax credit available to families with children. After the vote, the members of the Ways and Means Committee approved a bill that would repeal the estate tax, but it would not become effective until 2011. Page A1. 

Warnaco Loss Wider Than Forecast
Citing a difficult retail environment and the recently concluded litigation with the designer Calvin Klein, Warnaco Group reported a fourth-quarter loss larger than had been expected and warned that it would probably not be profitable in 2001. The loss amounted to nearly $195 million for the quarter ended in March and $338 million for the year. Before Warnaco announced its results, its shares rose 30 cents, to $1.60. Earlier in the week, they lost nearly 70 percent of their value when the company issued a profit warning. C4.

British Retailer Announces Cuts
The ailing icon of British retailing, Marks & Spencer, announced a restructuring plan that would cut 4,390 jobs, sell many of its businesses outside Britain, including the Brooks Brothers clothing chain and Kings Supermarkets in the United States, and abandon its expansion in Europe. World Business, Section W.

Dow Edges Up as Most Stocks Fall
Earnings worries sent most stocks lower for a second consecutive session. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.71 points, to 9,799.06.

Allianz Bid Could Touch Off Deals
If Allianz of Germany, the insurance conglomerate, completes its deal to buy Dresdner Bank, the company will become an all-purpose financial conglomerate comparable in breadth and scale to Citigroup. The deal would also increase the likelihood that the other German banks would start looking outside the country for partners. In fact, AXA, the giant French insurer, is talking with Deutsche Bank about a possible alliance. World Business, Section W.

HEADLINE: Facing Obstacles on Plan for Drilling for Arctic Oil, Bush Says He'll Look Elsewhere 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29 

 BODY:
Faced with strong opposition in Congress to his plans for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, President Bush said today that he was prepared to exploit oil and gas resources elsewhere in the nation on land that was not federally protected.
 And Mr. Bush said that if he could not wring enough fuel out of the United States, he would look to Canada and Mexico to address current domestic shortages. 
 "It doesn't matter to me where the gas comes from, in the long run, just so long as we get gas moving into the country," he said. 
It was the first time the president had suggested that he might not soon achieve his goal of extracting oil from the Arctic refuge in Alaska, although the oil and gas industry is lobbying Congress intensely for the right to drill there.
In a half-hour news conference in the White House briefing room, punctuated by easy banter with reporters, Mr. Bush took an assertive pro-business stand on a variety of domestic policy issues, including energy, the environment, taxes and regulation. 
"We will not do anything that harms our economy," the president declared in a blunt defense of his recent environmental actions, including his decision not to seek lower power-plant emissions of carbon dioxide, his withdrawal of President Bill Clinton's stricter limits on arsenic in drinking water and his refusal to participate in an international agreement on climate change. 
Mr. Bush said his administration would tighten the arsenic limits after a review of water standards. And he defended his administration's first steps to overrule Clinton administration orders, saying his actions were consistent with his bedrock belief that the economic health of American companies would take priority during his tenure. 
"Because, first things first, are the people who live in America," Mr. Bush said, explaining his desire to fire up the American economy, even if it meant disappointing other nations seeking a commitment to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases that many scientists believe lead to global warming.
"We'll be working with Germany; we'll be working with our allies to reduce greenhouse gases," he said. "But I will not accept a plan that will harm our economy and hurt American workers."
His approach so far, he suggested, provides a clear signal of how he will govern.
"People are beginning to learn what my administration is like," he said.
Mr. Bush said that world leaders were getting to know him, too -- and would be reassured in the process.
"I'm sure there were some concerns initially, because they didn't know me," he said, just before sitting down with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany to discuss, among other things, global warming. "And they heard all kinds of rumors about what our administration would be about. And now I have the chance to sit down and talk to them, face to face. I'm a pretty straightforward fellow."
True to his word, he said later in front of Mr. Schroder that the global warming treaty "makes no economic sense."
For much of his news conference, the second of his fledgling administration, Mr. Bush displayed a firm set of views on energy policy and the economy, and he seemed most determined to convey his desire to increase the nation's gas and oil supplies. Using language that has built in a steady crescendo from the final days of his presidential campaign, Mr. Bush declared the nation today to be in the throes of an energy crisis.
"Circumstances have changed since the campaign," he said. "We are now in an energy crisis. And that's why I decided to not have mandatory caps on CO2 , because in order to meet those caps, our nation would have had to have had, you know, a lot of natural gas immediately flow into the system, which is impossible. We don't have the infrastructure able to move natural gas."
Mr. Bush later amended his declaration of an energy crisis, holding it chiefly to California, where the state's program to deregulate the power industry has led to rolling blackouts.
"And we need a full affront on an energy crisis that is real in California and looms for other parts of our country if we don't move quickly," Mr. Bush said.
The notion that the nation is in the grip of an energy crisis is not universally accepted. The United States consumes a quarter of the world's energy but still pays among the lowest prices, leading some critics to suggest that Mr. Bush's eagerness for aggressive oil and gas exploration is rooted in his ties to the industry and its millions in campaign contributions.
Mr. Bush's warnings of a critical energy shortage did not include any recommendation that Americans adopt measures to conserve energy.
Mr. Bush has long advocated oil drilling in the Alaska Arctic refuge, which environmentalists consider a jewel of federally protected lands. But over the last few weeks, Congress has begun to squelch this plan through its budget resolutions.
Those who favor the drilling had estimated that finding gas there could yield $1.2 billion in energy revenues next year. But both the House and Senate omitted this figure from their budgets, signaling that they do not expect such revenues to materialize because they do not expect the drilling to be approved.
Mr. Bush said that if plans to drill in the Arctic refuge were stymied, he would look for oil sources in Canada's adjacent Northwest Territories.
Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said that Mr. Bush's remarks today reflected his realization that there was too much political opposition in Congress to allow the drilling.
"He recognizes that A.N.W.R. isn't going to pass," Mr. Reid said, using the initials for the refuge. "The American people don't want it."
Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said that Mr. Bush was not conceding defeat on the Alaska drilling. Mr. Fleischer acknowledged that achieving the goal through the budget looked like a dead end, but that the president would look for other vehicles.
But Mr. Bush seemed to sense the enormous political obstacles to drilling in Alaska. "There's a lot of other areas we can explore," he said. "There's gas in our hemisphere, and the fundamental question is, where's it going to come from? I'd like it to be American gas."
But the president remained firm in his larger goal.
"I'm interested in getting more energy supply, so that businesses can grow and people can heat their homes," he said. "We've got a shortage of energy in America."

 CORRECTION:
Excerpts from President Bush's news conference yesterday rendered a word incorrectly in some editions in a comment by Mr. Bush on his reason for opposing limits on the emission of carbon dioxide. Referring to an energy crisis, he said, "And that's why I decided to not have mandatory caps on CO2 ." He did not say "to now have mandatory caps on CO2 ."

HEADLINE: HOUSE PASSES BILL FOR 2 MORE PIECES OF BUSH'S TAX CUT 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29 

 BODY:
Forging ahead despite uncertain prospects in the Senate, the House of Representatives today approved two more elements of President Bush's tax-cut plan and took the first tentative step toward eventual repeal of the estate tax.
 By a vote of 282 to 144, the House passed a bill that would lower income taxes for married couples and double the tax credit available to families with children. The measure is somewhat more favorable than the Mr. Bush's proposal to low-income families and less beneficial to the wealthy. 
 Unlike the vote Wednesday on the outline of the president's budget and the one three weeks ago on the core of his tax plan -- an across-the-board cut in income-tax rates -- the vote today had some flavor of bipartisanship. Sixty-four Democrats joined the Republicans in supporting the bill. Opposing it were 143 Democrats and an independent, Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont.
Immediately after that vote, the members of the House Ways and Means Committee met and approved a bill that would abolish the estate tax. The repeal would not become fully effective until 2011, which has the effect of concealing its eventual cost. 
Before passing the bill with tax breaks for couples and families with children, the House rejected a Democratic measure to give taxpayers a $50 billion rebate this year. 
Republicans said that the rebate, which was meant to stimulate the economy quickly, should be considered as part of the permanent tax-reduction plan the president wants.
"We want to do all this stuff together," said Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois.
At a news conference this morning, Mr. Bush said he favored immediate tax relief, but added: "We've got to have long-term relief as well. Part of building confidence in our economy is not only to give consumers a boost but to have a plan that reduces rates for the long term so that people who make investments -- small-business owners, the entrepreneurs -- will have certainty that the cash flows of the future will be enhanced so they can expand their job base and make new capital purchases."
The outcome of the House votes today were predictable. The real test is to come next week when the Senate, evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, is scheduled to take up the president's budget outline, which allocates $1.6 trillion over 10 years for tax reduction.
It is clear that the president's tax plan does not command a majority in the Senate. But neither does any other tax and budget plan at this stage.
Republicans portrayed the bill the House passed today as a way to correct quirks in the tax law that cause some married couples, particularly those in which the husband and wife both work, to pay more income taxes than they would if they were single.
The bill, which would give all couples who pay income taxes a break, has these four parts: 
*It would raise the standard deduction, starting next year, to make it twice that for single people. This year, the standard deduction for couples is $7,600 and that for single people is $4,500.
*For couples who itemize deductions, the bill would gradually raise the amount of income covered by the 15 percent tax bracket so that it is twice that for single people.
*For low-income working couples, the bill would raise the amount of income on which they would be entitled to the earned-income tax credit.
*It would adjust the alternative minimum tax, a special tax on those with unusually large deductions, to ensure that married couples would not be treated less favorably than individuals.
The House's plan would be more generous than Mr. Bush's proposal for low-income couples and those couples with only one wage earner. 
The other part of the bill the House approved would double the tax credit for families with children to $1,000 a child, from $500; it would also make $100 of that increase retroactive and applicable to 2001 income taxes.
Workers with one or two children who do not owe enough in income taxes to be entitled to the full credit would be allowed a rebate up to the amount they paid in Social Security and Medicare taxes. Currently, only taxpayers with three or more children are entitled to that refund.
Families with incomes up to $130,000 are now entitled to the child tax credit, and the bill retains that income limit. Mr. Bush proposed raising it to $200,000 a family and did not suggest expanding the refund.
Republicans said the bill, which would cost about $400 billion over 10 years, would provide needed tax relief to struggling families, and many Democrats found that argument hard to resist. But Democratic leaders argued that the country might not be able to afford it if projected budget surpluses fail to materialize.
"What happens if they're wrong?" asked Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. He offered an alternative plan that would not have cut taxes nearly so much, but it was rejected, in a vote largely along party lines.
The legislation approved by the Ways and Means Committee would lower estate tax rates gradually, ending the tax entirely in 2011, though it is unclear how much the repeal would cost the government. 
The expert Congressional staff that estimates the cost of tax legislation only considers a 10-year time frame. It found that from 2002 through 2011, the bill approved by the Ways and Means Committee would cost $193 billion, a large part of it in 2011. But the cost in the following decade would be much larger.
The tax staff has estimated that if the estate tax were repealed right away, the cost in the next 10 years would be $662 billion.
Democrats treated the proposal to repeal estate taxes as a joke. "Who in their right mind is going to think that this is ever going to happen?" asked Representative Gerald D. Kleczka of Wisconsin.
"It ain't going to occur because of the cost," he continued. "Who are we kidding? It's less than honest."
But Representative Jim Nussle, the Republican of Iowa who is chairman of the Budget Committee, said that the Republican approach was a responsible way to meet Mr. Bush's request that his tax package cost no more than $1.6 trillion. 
"We're serious about making it fit," Mr. Nussle said.
The president's plan, which would phase out the estate tax more quickly and eliminate it in 2008, is estimated by the White House to cost $266 billion over 10 years.

HEADLINE: In Bush's Words: 'Both Sides Must Take Important Steps' in the Mideast 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference today, as transcribed by Federal News Service Inc.:

OPENING STATEMENT
 PRESIDENT BUSH -- Good morning. First, I want to say how pleased I am that the House yesterday passed on a realistic, common-sense budget to the Senate. I appreciated the vote. They did the right thing. It's a budget that meets our nation's priorities. It's also a budget that leaves ample room for meaningful real long-lasting tax relief. I look forward to working with the Senate to get a budget passed. 
 I'm also deeply concerned about the escalating violence in the Middle East. It is claiming the lives of innocent civilians on both sides. The tragic cycle of incitement, provocation and violence has gone on far too long. Both sides must take important steps to calm the situation now. 
The Palestinian Authority should speak out publicly and forcibly -- in a language that the Palestinian people -- to condemn violence and terrorism. It should arrest those who perpetrated the terrorist acts. It should resume security cooperation with Israel. 
The government of Israel, for its part, should exercise restraint in its military response. It should take steps to restore normalcy to the lives of the Palestinian people by easing closures and removing checkpoints. Last week, Prime Minister Sharon assured me that his government wants to move in this direction, and I urge Israel to do so. 
I will be meeting with Egypt's President Mubarak next Monday and Jordan's King Abdullah the week after to seek their help in defusing the tensions. Egypt and Jordan are two of our most important partners in the region, and their role is crucial. 
I have asked Secretary Powell to call Chairman Arafat today and contact other leaders to urge them to stand against violence. Our diplomats in the region are fully engaged in this effort. Our goal is to encourage a series of reciprocal and parallel steps by both sides that will halt the escalation of violence, provide safety and security for civilians on both sides and restore normalcy to the lives of everyone in the region. 
A lasting peace in the region will come only when the parties agree directly on its terms. This week, I vetoed an unbalanced U.N. resolution, because it tried to force the adoption of a mechanism on which both parties did not agree. My approach will be to facilitate the parties' work in finding their own solution to peace. We seek to build a stable foundation for restoring confidence, rebuilding security cooperation and resuming a political dialogue between the parties. 
I'd be glad to answer some questions. 

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Campaign Finance

Q. Mr. President, the Senate, as you know, is finishing up legislation to ban all soft money. What do you think of the bill, particularly the ban on individual contributions that you forcefully opposed in the campaign? And specifically, sir, would you sign it?

A. This is a bill in progress. It's a bill that continues to change. And I'll take a look at it when it makes my desk. And if it improves the system, I'll sign it. I look forward to signing a good piece of legislation.

Q. Could you sign a bill that bans individual soft money contributions?

A. I'll look at the whole bill. And I'll make my determination as to whether or not the bill improves the situation. . . .

Russia's Weapons Program

Q. Mr. President, is your administration reviewing U.S. aid to Russia to stop the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons? Are you considering reducing that aid? And if so, why?

A. Well, we're reviewing all programs, those related to de-escalating potential nuclear problems. We want to make sure that any money that is being spent is being spent in an effective way. . . . And we fully intend to continue to cooperate with the Russians. It's in our nation's best interests to dismantle -- work with Russia to dismantle its nuclear arsenal. . . . Helen?

Health and Environment

Q. Mr. President, in the last few weeks, you have rolled back health and safety and environmental measures proposed by the last administration and other previous administrations. This has been widely interpreted as a payback time to your corporate donors. Are they more important than the American people's health and safety? And what else do you plan to repeal?

A. Well, Helen, I told people pretty plainly that I was going to review all the last-minute decisions that my predecessor had made, and that is exactly what we're doing.
I presume you're referring to the decision on arsenic in water. First of all, there had been no change in the arsenic, accepted arsenic level, in water since the 40's. And at the very last minute, my predecessor made a decision. And we pulled back his decision so that we can make a decision based upon sound science and what's realistic. There will be a reduction in the acceptable amount of arsenic per billion after the review in the E.P.A. . . . 
For example, circumstances have changed since the campaign. We are now in an energy crisis. And that's why I decided to not have mandatory caps on CO2 , because in order to meet those caps, our nation would have had to have had, you know, a lot of natural gas immediately flow into the system, which is impossible. We don't have the infrastructure able to move natural gas.
We need to have an active exploration program. One of the big debates that's taking place in the Congress or will take place in the Congress is whether or not we should be exploring for natural gas in Alaska, for example, in A.N.W.R. Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . I strongly think we should in order to make sure that we've got enough gas to be able to help reduce greenhouse emissions in the country. 
See, gas is clean, and yet there's not enough of it. And we've got pipeline capacity problems in the country. We have an energy shortage. I look forward to explaining this today to the leader of Germany as to why I made the decision I made. We'll be working with Germany. We'll be working with our allies to reduce greenhouse gases. But I will not accept a plan that will harm our economy and hurt American workers. John? 

The Economy and Taxes

Q. Mr. President, new figures out today show that the economy grew at an annual rate of 1 percent ----

A. Right.

Q. Over the last three months of the year 2000. My question to you, sir, is what are you prepared to do to immediately stimulate the economy, because it would appear that your long-term tax package does not do it, yet you dismiss, out-of-hand, attempts from the Hill to give back a rebate of some $60 billion this year unless it's tied to longer-term tax relief? Why can you not sign a short-term package and then pursue your long-term package separate to that?

A. Well, John, first of all, I support the efforts on the Hill to provide immediate tax relief. I've been calling for immediate tax relief. I think it makes sense to do so. But we've got to have long-term relief, as well.
Part of building confidence in our economy is not only give the consumers a boost, but to have a plan that reduces rates for the long term, so that people who make investments -- small business owners, the entrepreneurs -- will have certainty that the cash flows of the future will be enhanced so they can expand their job base and make new capital purchases. I appreciate very much what the leadership in the Senate -- Tom Daschle, for example, talked about immediate tax relief or immediate rebates, plus reducing rates permanently. You just need to reduce more rates than the ones he suggested. 
There is a debate going on here in Washington and it's really do you want to increase the size of the federal government or do you want to give -- let people keep their own money? And there's a philosophical divide. And I'm going to continue to stand on the side of the people and make it as clear as I can that we've met our priorities in the budget I submitted. . . .

Q. But with respect, sir, as the debate continues, consumers are not seeing any more money back in their pockets.

A. Well, that's exactly right, and you've got a good point. Consumers haven't seen any money back in their pockets. That's why it's important for the Senate to act quickly on the budget. . . .

Q. You're no longer negotiating with yourself on tax cuts. There are a lot of other approaches that are out there. Why not say today exactly what you're willing to do to appease both moderate Republicans and Democrats who fear that those projected budget surpluses won't materialize, and they want some way to cut off a tax cut if that's the case, if we can't afford it? What will you do?

A. Listen, I'm anxious to talk to members of the Senate about the so-called look-back provisions. But I'm going to remind people that one way budget surpluses will not materialize is if Congress overspends. And so any look-back procedure has got to make sure that there are restraints to government spending. The surest way to eat up the surplus is to have the kind of spending that took place during the last fiscal year, when discretionary spending increased by 8 percent. And by the way, I'm still negotiating with myself. . . .

Q. Will you sign or veto tax cuts that exceed $1.6 trillion, even if it would result from -- that increase -- would result from an immediate stimulus to the economy this year?

A. David, I hope that Congress does not diminish the size of the tax-relief package that I've sent up there nor increase the size of the tax-relief package I sent up there. The 1.6 is the size that I think is right. We've had a lot of discussion here in Washington about whether it's too big or too small. Nothing has changed my opinion as to whether or not -- about the size of the package I sent. It's the right size. . . .


The Middle East

Q. For a couple months, both you and officials in your administration have indicated that you wanted to step back from constant involvement of the U.S. and the president in the conflict and in the peace process. Was that a mistake, given the escalation of both violence and the rhetoric over there? And is what you're doing today perhaps an admission that the involvement of the United States and the president of the United States publicly and personally is necessary for the parties inaudible ?

A. Terry, I have said all along that this nation will not try to force a peace settlement in the Middle East, that we will facilitate a peace settlement. It requires two willing parties to come to the table to enact a peace treaty that will last. And this administration won't try to force peace on the parties. That's what the U.N. tried to do the other day. They tried to force a situation in the Middle East that both -- to which both parties did not agree. And that's why I vetoed their suggestion.
We have been fully engaged in the Middle East. We're on the phone all the time to the leaders. I'm welcoming leaders to come. In order for there to be a peace, this country must develop what I call a broad foundation for peace. 
That means we've got to have good, strong relations with the Egyptians and the Jordanians and the Saudis. You may remember the secretary of state went to Syria to sit down with Bashar President Bashar al-Assad . And we've got a lot of work to do in order to build that foundation for peace. But we're going to make a full-time effort to do so. . . . But this country cannot impose a timetable nor a settlement on the parties if they're unwilling to accept it.

Q. But really to contain the violence, sir, do you, personally, need to get more involved? Is that what you're doing today?

A. I am involved on the telephone. I met with Prime Minister Sharon. I'm talking to our allies and friends in the Middle East. I've instructed the secretary of state to call Mr. Arafat. And implicit in your question is the first step, and that is the violence must cease in order for there to be any meaningful dialogue in the Middle East.
And so we're in the process of trying to bring calm to the region, and it's going to require more than just one voice. Obviously our voice is an important voice for bringing calm to the Middle East. So are other nations'. And I look forward to visiting with President Mubarak and King Abdullah to lend -- to rally them to try to convince, particularly, in their case, Mr. Arafat, to speak out against violence in a language that the Palestinians can understand. 

Energy

Q. Mr. President, you have mentioned today that there is an energy crisis.

A. Yes.

Q. And yet the budget resolutions that have passed the House and are due to be considered in the Senate next week do not include any revenue from the drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I've talked to the people who've made that decision, and they said it is a political fight. They believe unwinnable. That you could not, nor could they, create the majorities in either the House or the Senate to bring about drilling in A.N.W.R., your No. 1 solution -- or one of the top solutions to dealing with the energy crisis. Does this not represent a rejection from your own party of dealing with the energy situation?

A. Well, Major, first of all, there are other areas in the United States on which we can find natural gas. I think it's important for us to open up A.N.W.R. Whether or not the Congress sees it that way is another matter. That's not going to deter me from having, for example, the interior secretary look at all lands that are not to be fully protected for exploration.
We've got to plan to make sure that gas comes -- flows freely out of Canada into the United States. I've talked to the prime minister about that. What I find interesting is that -- I think we've had meaningful discussions about exploration in the Northwest Territories. 
Right across the line, admittedly miles away, is A.N.W.R. But nevertheless, there's a big, vast region of natural gas, and it's important for us to explore and encourage exploration and work with the Canadians to get pipelines coming out of the Northwest Territories to the United States. I've talked to the president of Mexico about a policy. There's going to be a lot of areas where we can find natural gas in America other than A.N.W.R. It would be helpful if we opened up A.N.W.R. I think it's a mistake not to. And I would urge you all to travel up there and take a look at it. And you can make . . . the determination as to how beautiful that country is.

Q. If I may follow up?

A. Yes, Major.

Q. If the American people are looking to you to deal with the energy crisis and you cannot look to your own party to deal with what you and your own advisers have said is a crucial area in which to explore, how can the American public have confidence in your ability to deal with Congress to address a situation you have called today a crisis?

A. There's a lot of other areas we can explore, Major. And one of them is to work with the Canadians. There's gas in our hemisphere, and the fundamental question is where's it going to come from? I'd like it to be American gas. But if the Congress decides not to have for exploration in A.N.W.R., we'll work with the Canadians. . . .
And we also need to have clean coal technologies, as well. And we need a full affront on an energy crisis that is real in California and looms for other parts of our country if we don't move quickly.

Relations With McCain

Q. Mr. President, as I'm sure you've been aware, there are stories consistently about tensions, persistent tensions, between you and Senator John McCain, dating back to your rivalry in the primaries. I wonder if you could address that, not just on the campaign finance reform bill but also on the Patients' Bill of Rights, which -- McCain supporters believe you don't want to sign a Patients' Bill of Rights with McCain's name on it.

A. Well, look, this is Washington, D.C., gossip, is how I view it. I mean I respect John McCain. I like him a lot. That doesn't mean we're going to agree 100 percent of the time. I mean, we're obviously -- we got some differences. That's what the primary was all about, airing our differences. But I respect John. And this -- you know, I realize -- I mean, it's a game in Washington to try to create tension between John McCain and me. And I'm not going to let it happen. Now I can't control the stories that seem to be popping up all the time and the kind of the faceless aides that are out there trying to stir the pot. I can just give you my perspective.

Q. Mr. President ----

A. I like him. I -- he's a good man. We have some differences. And I will -- you know -- I think the idea, for example, of having a $5 million cap on punitive damages is just not the right public policy. But that shouldn't surprise you. After all, I signed a bill in the State of Texas with a $750,000 cap on punitive damages. But that's nothing personal, just a difference of opinion. And the idea of the president laying out, you know, a framework for debate and some guidelines is a perfectly acceptable practice in Washington, D.C. . . .

Relations With Arafat

Q. Sir, why is it that you have not decided to invite Yasir Arafat here? Have you concluded that he's part of the problem, not part of the solution?

A. We're going to work with all parties. As I mentioned, the secretary of state is calling Chairman Arafat today to urge him to stop the violence and call upon those over whom he's got influence to stop the violence. And I've got quite a crowded calendar of leaders who are coming to see me, and I'm looking forward to visiting with President Mubarak and King Abdullah. . . .

Q. The Palestinians think you're sending them a signal. Are you?

A. The signal I'm sending to the Palestinians is stop the violence. And I can't make it any more clear. And I hope that Chairman Arafat hears it loud and clear. He's going to hear it again on the telephone today. This is not the first time the message has been delivered. . . .

Relations With Allies

Q. Mr. President, allies of the United States have complained that you haven't consulted them sufficiently on your stance with negotiations with North Korea, Kyoto Treaty, your deteriorating relations elsewhere. If you strictly read the international press, it looks like everyone's mad at us. Mr. President, how do you think that came to be? And what, if anything, do you plan to do about it?

A. Well, I get a completely different picture, of course, when I sit down with the world leaders. I'm looking forward to sitting down with Mr. Schroder here in about 30 minutes. I've had very honest and straightforward visits with many of the world's leaders. And there's a -- sure there were some concerns initially, because they didn't know me. They heard all kinds of rumors about what our administration would be about. And I now have the chance to sit down and talk them face to face. . . .
On missile defense, for example, I've assured our allies that we will consult with them. But we're moving forward to develop systems that reflect the threats of today. I mean, who knows where the next terrorist attack is going to come from? But we'd better we ready for it. And I believe I've got the opportunity to convince our friends and allies that our vision makes sense. It brings a lot of common sense to an old, stale debate, the old arms-control debate. 
In terms of the CO2 issue, I'm going to -- I will explain as clearly as I can today and every other chance I get that we will not do anything that harms our economy, because first things first, are the people who live in America. That's my priority. 
And I'm worried about the economy, I'm worried about the lack of an energy policy, I'm worried about rolling blackouts in California. It's in our national interests that we develop a strong energy policy with realistic common-sense environmental policy. And I'm going to explain that to our friends. 
It is in their interest, by the way, that our economy remain strong. After all, we're a free-trading administration. We trade with each other. 
And people are beginning to learn what my administration is like, and they're going to find we're steadfast friends, but a friend is somebody who's willing to tell the truth, and if there's a disagreement, to be able to state it clearly, to make it clear where we disagree. But for those who worry about our willingness to consult, they shouldn't worry; we are. We're going to be open-minded, and we'll have open dialogue. . . .

Timing of Tax Cuts

Q. You have said that you want to have a tax-cut rate reduction and you also support the efforts to try to do a quick retroactive tax cut. When you speak of those two things, will you insist upon one package of bills that includes the rate reduction and any kind of quick short-term stimulus or would you accept some kind of verifiable promise that they'll get to your tax cuts later?

A. That's the old "trust me"?

Q. Yeah!

A. Look, it is in our nation's best interests to have long-term tax relief, and that has been my focus all along. I'm confident we can have it, get it done. I believe not only can we get long-term tax relief in place. Since our country is running some surpluses in spite of the dire predictions about cash flow, I believe we have an opportunity to fashion an immediate stimulus package, as well. The two ought to go hand in hand. Those who think that they can say, "We're only going to have a stimulus package, but let's forget tax relief," misunderestimate -- or, excuse me, underestimate -- just making sure you were paying attention. You were! Laughter Underestimate our administration's resolve to get this done. . . .

Trade Talks With Brazil

Q. Mr. President, you spoke about free trade at the last press conference. You mentioned it today. You will be meeting tomorrow with the president of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He is the one person -- at least Brazil is the one person in the continent or the one country -- who is not in a rush to come to a free-trade agreement.

A. Right. Right.

Q. They prefer Mercosur, you know, the free trade agreement of South America. Is your administration interested in getting the free-trade agreement by the 2003 year instead of the 2005 year, as has been agreed? And how do you expect to convince Mr. Cardoso tomorrow to follow that?

A. Well, the sooner we can get a free-trade agreement in the hemisphere, the better. As to whether or not it's 2003 or 2004, that's -- we'll just have to see if we can't convince our friends in South America the wisdom of doing it as soon as possible. It's going to be -- the meeting tomorrow is going to be an important meeting. Brazil is a huge country. It's got a significant role in our hemisphere, and it's got a very bright future.
To the extent that the country is skeptical about our intention to have free, fair trade, you know, I have a chance to undermine that skepticism and I'm going to. I'm going to look the man in the eye and say, "We are free traders."

HEADLINE: Personal Spending Rises 0.3% 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30 

 BODY:
Personal spending rose in February after the biggest gain in almost a year, and rising confidence suggested consumers might help keep the economy out of recession, government and industry reports showed today.
 Spending rose 0.3 percent last month, led by increased business at auto dealers, after a 1 percent rise in January, the Commerce Department said. 
Incomes rose 0.4 percent after rising 0.5 percent the month before. The University of Michigan's final index of consumer sentiment rose to 91.5 in March from 90.6 in February, but was down from a midmonth reading of 91.8. 
 Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic growth, is helping keep the 10-year economic expansion from faltering even as manufacturing struggles. The National Association of Purchasing Management in Chicago reported that its index of regional manufacturing fell to its lowest level in almost two decades.
Personal spending may increase at a 3 percent to 3.5 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, according to statistics compiled by Bloomberg News. That is up from the 2.8 percent pace in the fourth quarter, which was the slowest in three and a half years.
Still, falling stock prices and a slowdown in manufacturing may limit consumer optimism and restrain spending. The Chicago purchasers report said the monthly index of regional manufacturing fell to 35 in March -- the lowest since March 1982 -- from 43.2 in February. A reading below 50 means business at factories slowed.
The increase in January spending was the strongest since February 2000 when it increased 1.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Harbingers Of Bad Times; 
The Ranks of Job Recruiters Are Thinning Out Rapidly

BYLINE:  By KATIE HAFNER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 28 

 BODY:
The job-recruiting business has been very good to Herb Deitz. Last summer, Mr. Deitz, who manages the recruitment business for Unitek, a technology consulting firm that works mostly with start-ups, had 35 people reporting to him, with plans to expand. So when business started to slow in December, he ascribed it to the usual end-of-the-year sluggishness.
 But when the holidays passed, Mr. Deitz's business, based in Fremont, Calif., 25 miles south of Oakland, continued to shrink. Today, he is down to 10 recruiters, with no upturn in sight. 
 As the dot-com economy rose over the last two to three years, the number of recruiters swelled by some 400 percent, Mr. Deitz estimates, attracting people from a wide range of other professions. Many turned to recruiting as a path to wealth. In some places, recruiters, who are often seen as harbingers of economic trends, were in even greater demand than the employees they were supposed to be seeking. 
But the recent industry downturn -- the sudden layoffs and the failure of many of the start-ups that recruiters like Mr. Deitz relied on for work -- is thinning their ranks.
"I haven't seen it this difficult in five or six years," said Mr. Deitz, 52, who has been a job recruiter for more than 20 years. Until this year, he said, he averaged 125 assignments a year from companies needing recruiting help.
"This year so far I've got a total of about 20," he said. And in the last three months, Mr. Deitz added, he has received more than 500 resumes from recruiters in search of work.
Many recruiters say it is the rapidity with which business has fallen off that caught them by surprise. "In other years, it was very gradual, a layoff here or there over a three- or six-month period," Mr. Deitz said. "This time it's been right off the cliff."
He said four clients called recently, all on the same day, to say they would no longer be recruiting new employees. "There's not much more you can do when they say that."
The rest of the recruiting industry, outside of high technology, appears to be relatively unscathed. Ben Meador, president of Meador Staffing Services, a diversified recruiting firm based in Houston, which has offices in 14 states, said the office in Austin, Tex., was the only one suffering.
"We had the very best month we've ever had in the month of December," Mr. Meador said. Paul Hawkinson, publisher of the Fordyce Letter, a newsletter for recruiters, based in St. Louis, was also sanguine about fields outside of technology. Mr. Hawkinson said 2,009 new recruiting firms had sprung up in the last six months.
But parts of the country where technology looms large in the local economy are being similarly unkind to recruiters. Kathleen Sullivan, a former recruiter at Dell Computer, in Round Rock, Tex., near Austin, was laid off last month.
"Just last year, recruiters were in more demand than a lot of the technical folks," said Ms. Sullivan, 47, who came to the recruiting field 15 years ago, after working in a hospital as a lab technician.
Recruiters, Ms. Sullivan pointed out, are like canaries in the coal mine, often the first to feel the effects of a shake-out. Ms. Sullivan said that as soon as Dell's stock began to fall last summer, she knew her job was in peril.
"You could see the writing on the wall," Ms. Sullivan said. "If your job is hiring, and if your company isn't hiring, you need to wonder."
Employment recruiting can be lucrative. Contract recruiters can make as much as $150 an hour. Executive search firms are typically paid a percentage of a recruit's annual salary, which can also make for a healthy income.
The San Francisco Bay area appears to have been the worst hit, at least for contract recruiters, who are paid whether or not a placement is made. "There's been a real backlash against contract recruiters," said Mr. Deitz, who is one of them. "An executive search guy doesn't get paid until an employee is placed."
Chris Turner, a 31-year-old recruiter in Bay Point, Calif., used to attend a monthly recruiters' lunch in Silicon Valley. At the lunches, Mr. Turner recalled, dozens of openings for recruiters would be announced. At the last one he attended, in January, "there were maybe three open jobs," he said, "and 200 recruiters looking for work." He stopped going.
In good times, people like Mr. Turner flock to the recruiting profession from other, less-well-paying fields. Mr. Turner, who sold construction equipment before going into recruiting three years ago, was making $75 an hour working as a recruiter at a start-up. But the company lost its second round of financing and Mr. Turner was laid off two days before Christmas.
Not only has the recent turn of events led to the shrinking of Mr. Turner's savings account, but he is planning to leave the recruiting field altogether, and go into sales for a uniform service company, a move he conceded was "definitely a big leap for me."
Mr. Turner said he loved his job as a recruiter -- while it lasted. "It's a rewarding feeling," he said, "finding a match with someone's skill set and having someone see you in the hallway and say, 'Thanks for helping me out.' " 
But veterans in the industry are not terribly unhappy to see their less experienced colleagues exit. "It's the same as with real estate," said Garrett Browning, a longtime recruiter in Sonoma County, Calif. "When the market is up, all kinds of people just jump in, and it doesn't matter if they're good or not, because companies are so desperate to fill positions."
Mr. Browning said the lean times for high-technology recruiters had been helpful in sifting out the bad recruiters. This is an opinion held with particular vehemence by those who have spent years earning their stripes in the business.
"Spring is coming and they can go mow other people's lawns until they find their next calling," Mr. Hawkinson said.
Mr. Hawkinson's uncharitable sentiment is echoed by many recruits themselves, who hold a dim view of those who come calling. Noah Fiedel, a software engineer who at 23 has already held three jobs with Internet start-ups, has little good to say about his experience with recruiters.
"You're fresh meat to them," said Mr. Fiedel, who only recently found a new job after several months of searching. "I used to get calls at 6 a.m. and I'd get e-mail from recruiters saying, 'We'll give you $150,000 if you relocate.' "
Those promises disappeared, but not the early morning phone calls. "Then they'd call me just to check in, and apologize that they didn't have anything," Mr. Fiedel said.
The one interview he did get through a recruiter turned out to be for a position he was completely unsuited for, Mr. Fiedel recalled. "Every job I've landed has been from word of mouth, or a friend's connection, not a recruiter."
Mary Fetherolf, a technology product manager in San Francisco who recently found a job after nearly three months of searching, had a similar opinion. Ms. Fetherolf said she received a call from a recruiter in response to her online resume. "She said, 'I've got this position in Redwood City,' and I said that's too far," said Ms. Fetherolf, who stated her firm position against the hourlong commute to the south.
"She was about to hang up, then she asked me again, 'Are you sure Redwood City is too far?' " Ms. Fetherolf said. "She's desperate, I'm desperate, but we have different parameters."
Desperation is not necessarily a deterrence. Ms. Sullivan said she would like to stay in the recruiting field, even if it meant relocating. "Have I considered going to sell shoes yet?" she said. "No, not yet. I'd have to sell a lot of shoes."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Stocks End Gloomy First Quarter as Investors Look to the Next

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
One of Wall Street's longest winters ever finally ended yesterday, as investors closed a miserable quarter with a muted rally.
 Three months ago, the mood on Wall Street was guardedly optimistic. After plunging through the fall, the market as a whole seemed reasonably valued, if not exactly cheap. 
 Optimistic strategists like Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs expected the market to rebound solidly in 2001. And when the Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut short-term interest rates on Jan. 3 by one-half percentage point in an effort to stimulate growth, investors bought stocks with abandon, pushing the Nasdaq composite index up 14.2 percent for the day. 
But the rally soon fizzled, even though the Fed cut rates a second time on Jan. 31. By the end of February, stocks were lower than they had been before the Fed's first rate cut. March brought further declines.
"Every strategist on the street, including myself, put together a table of how stocks do 12 months after the first rate cut," said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "Then we did it after the second cut. Then we did it after the third. And while we were putting out this happy news, stocks kept going down."
The market's problems reflect the weakness in the economy, which has slowed to a crawl after years of strong growth. Information technology companies, which led the boom, have been hardest hit, with many posting weaker-than-expected earnings and layoffs.
With no end to the slowdown in sight, investors are shedding the technology and telecommunications stocks they wanted so desperately for most of the 1990's.
After falling more than half from its peak last March, the Nasdaq composite index dropped another 25.5 percent this quarter, losing 630.26 points to close at 1,840.26. (Yesterday, the Nasdaq gained 19.69 points, or 1.1 percent.) It was the fourth-worst quarter ever for the Nasdaq. The worst was last fall, when the index fell 32.7 percent.
"This was one of the ugliest quarters we've seen in a long time," said John Morosani, manager of the $240 million ING Barings Furman Selz small-cap value fund. "What you really saw was the unwinding of all the excesses that were put in place in 1998, 1999 and the first months of 2000."
Individual technology stocks, even market leaders like Cisco Systems, have been even harder hit. Cisco shares dropped another 59 percent for the quarter and are now down more than four-fifths from their peak last March, wiping out more than $400 billion in shareholder wealth. Cisco closed yesterday at $15.81, up 56 cents.
Broader market indexes also suffered this winter, although not as badly. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 159.95 points, or 12.1 percent, to finish the quarter at 1,160.33. The drop put the index into a bear market for the first time since at least 1987. (Wall Street generally defines a bear market as a prolonged fall of 20 percent or more in a major index; there is some debate whether the October 1987 crash qualifies, since stocks began to rebound almost immediately after their plunge.)
The Dow Jones industrial average, which is less weighted to technology than the other major indexes, showed the most strength. The Dow lost 908.07 points, or 8.4 percent, to close the quarter at 9,878.78, on top of its 6.2 percent loss last year. (The Dow rose 79.72 points, or 0.8 percent, yesterday, while the S.& P. 500 picked up 12.38 points, or 1.1 percent.)
In a surprising exception to the woes of many technology stocks, Microsoft was the Dow's strongest component for the quarter. Microsoft rose 26.1 percent, after losing 63 percent last year, as investors grew more optimistic about the company's chances for resolving its antitrust battle. Other winners included Philip Morris, the tobacco and food giant, which rose 7.8 percent, on top of a 91 percent gain last year.
Despite this quarter's problems, many strategists remain optimistic that the market is overdue for a rebound. The Fed's rate cuts are certain to help the economy eventually, and on a price-earnings basis, the overall market is no longer expensive, the bulls say. Even some longtime bears have begun to change their stance.
"The market looks a lot better under the surface than it does upfront," said Christine A. Callies, the chief American investment strategist for Merrill Lynch. She noted that many stocks actually bottomed in the fall, and that the stocks of companies whose fates are closely tied to economic growth have already begun to rally. Their gains show that the worst of the slowdown may be over and that some investors are anticipating a recovery, Ms. Callies said.
"In the first few months of a Fed policy change, not everybody thinks it will work," Ms. Callies said. "I don't think that the turn the market wants to see is very far away. I think there should be a sustainable rally in the second quarter."
Then again, lots of investors thought that about the first quarter, too. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise

Treasury bond prices rose yesterday as a report showing manufacturing activity in the Chicago area sank to 19-year lows in March as separate reports showed consumer confidence and spending remaining resilient.
"I think that the Chicago data is going to suggest to a lot of people that the Federal Reserve is going to have to act more aggressively again and doesn't have time to waste," said Kim Rupert, senior economist at Standard & Poor's MMS.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 21/32, to a price of 100 23/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.90 percent from 4.99 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 21/32, to 98 30/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.44 percent from 5.49 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Beijing Agents Detain Another Chinese-Born American 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 30 

 BODY:
In the latest in a series of detentions that are causing frictions between the United States and China, Chinese security agents detained a Chinese-born American citizen last month as he crossed the border from Hong Kong, where he works as a business professor and consultant, the American Embassy said today.
 The continued and unexplained detention of Li Shaomin, 44, a naturalized citizen who earned a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1988, follows several other incidents in which Chinese-born scholars who are either citizens or permanent residents of the United States have been detained or harassed here on hazy security grounds. Some cases have not been publicized because their relatives abroad fear possible repercussions for the person being held. 
 Although American officials have no legal responsibility for permanent residents, so-called green-card holders, they are so concerned by the recent pattern of interrogations and detentions of visiting scholars that they have debated whether to issue a public warning to Chinese-born researchers who live abroad, Western diplomats said this week. This would be highly embarrassing to the Chinese government, and up to now, the embassy has just protested privately to the Foreign Ministry. 
Another scholar, Gao Zhan, a sociologist who is a research fellow at American University in Washington and a permanent American resident, has been held in isolation since Feb. 11, with the Chinese government declaring that she has confessed to espionage, but offering no details or evidence. President Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell have called for her release.
Several other Chinese-born scholars who live in the United States or in other countries have also been subjected to intimidating interrogations or detained while visiting China in the last year, diplomats said.
The incidents come at a sensitive time in China's international relations, with the two detentions occurring in the same month that China was host to inspectors judging Beijing's application to hold the 2008 Olympics, and as Beijing seeks friendly ties with the new Bush administration.
Political experts here said the ill-timed detentions appeared to reflect the power, relative autonomy and conservatism of the Ministry of State Security. Some speculated, too, that security officials were seizing a chance to put a crimp in the activities of the thousands of Chinese-born scholars, especially in social sciences and international relations, who attend graduate school abroad and return to China for research.
Such scholars are far better able to blend into society than outsiders, possibly enabling them to delve more effectively into China's problems, and many also hold relatively liberal political views. 
Chinese-born scholars abroad are starting to fear that, "with the tightening of the security atmosphere in China it becomes potentially dangerous to be involved in what the outside world, and even many within China, think of as normal scholarship," said Andrew Nathan, a political scientist at Columbia University who advises graduate students.
Mr. Li's recent academic work focuses on market competition and China's transition from socialism, but he has also advocated political change. His father, a former Communist Party theorist, was jailed for 10 months in 1989 for supporting the student democracy movement. But Mr. Li's wife said her husband did not belong to any dissident groups and had engaged only in academic work and business consulting. He also was involved with an Internet company in China.
As with Ms. Gao, who was detained with her husband and 5-year-old son as they prepared to board a plane home after a family visit, Mr. Li's detention came out of the blue, relatives say. Ms. Gao's husband, who was sworn in as an American citizen today in Washington, and son, an American citizen by birth, were released after being held for 26 days without access to lawyers or relatives.
Mr. Li had often visited China with no problems since taking up his post in the marketing department of the City University of Hong Kong in 1996, advising Western and Chinese companies and lecturing at universities. Last May he was invited to Beijing to address a Communist Party meeting on the transition to a market economy.
But on the evening of Feb. 25, he was picked up by Chinese State Security officials in Shenzhen, near the Hong Kong border. His wife, Liu Yingli, learned something was wrong only when he failed to return the next day as planned.
"There was no warning at all," said Ms. Liu, who is also a naturalized American citizen and a lecturer in marketing at City University of Hong Kong. "I've used every cell in my brain, and I can't figure it out."
Ms. Liu reported to the Hong Kong police on Feb. 26 that her husband was missing. She was later informed of his detention by American diplomats who said the Chinese authorities, in keeping with a longstanding agreement, had notified the American Embassy that Mr. Li was being held. She has heard nothing directly from the Chinese government.
An embassy spokesman said that a consular official had met with Mr. Li and spoken with his wife, but that under American privacy laws he could not reveal other details of the case. It was not clear whether American officials had been informed of Mr. Li's alleged crimes.
But some Western officials privately said they feared that the Chinese security forces were trying to intimidate scholars, especially those who have remained Chinese citizens and thus lack diplomatic protection, and might wish to stifle the huge and often surprisingly free exchange of information and research between China and the West.
In 1999, Song Yongyi, a librarian and researcher at Dickenson College in Pennsylvania, a Chinese citizen who had a green card and was on the verge of gaining American citizenship, was arrested during what had seemed a routine trip gathering historical materials from the tumultuous period of Mao's Cultural Revolution. That topic is sensitive, but he had made similar trips before without incident. He was released after an outcry from American scholars. 
The case of Hua Di, a nuclear missile expert who fled to the United States in 1989 but then was lured back for a visit in 1998 with false promises of safety and arrested, was more directly linked to security issues. Mr. Hua had written articles on China's military, which he claimed were based on publicly available documents, and has been sentenced to 10 years for disclosing state secrets. 
Ms. Gao, the sociologist, has studied women's and family issues, and took part in two brief study tours to Taiwan. Her colleagues and family say they see no reason for spying charges.
Mr. Li's detention last month appears puzzling, though his family background is sure to be regarded with suspicion by security officials here. His father, Li Honglin, was a prominent liberal theorist in the Communist Party in the 1980's, calling for a loosening of one-party rule. He ran afoul of Deng Xiaoping, the late leader, who advocated greater economic freedom while preserving the Communist dictatorship. In 1987 he was transferred from Beijing to head a research institute in the southern province of Fujian.
In 1989, after he publicly supported the pro-democracy movement that swelled in Tiananmen Square, the father was jailed for 10 months. He subsequently moved to the United States and now lives with his son's family in Hong Kong.
The younger Mr. Li, who was studying in the United States at the time, signed an open letter in support of the democracy movement. In addition to publishing many technical articles in leading economic and business journals he has written on China's broader need for political change. But in recent years, with the government promoting the introduction of market forces into the economy, his economic expertise had seemed to make him a welcome guest in China, his wife said today.

HEADLINE: Effective Nuclear Disarmament 

 BODY:
Among the most cost-effective defense dollars America spends are those that pay for reducing Russia's arsenal of leftover cold-war weapons. The Bush administration began a review of these "threat reduction" programs this week, saying it wanted to make them more efficient. But there are troubling signs that Mr. Bush is planning to reconsider his campaign promise to increase overall funding for these valuable programs and cut them instead. That would be a serious mistake. 
 During the cold war Washington spent trillions of dollars defending against Russian nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Over the past decade, for a little less than $6 billion, America has financed, among other things, the deactivation of more than 5,000 Soviet-era nuclear warheads, conversion of more than 110 metric tons of bomb-grade uranium into commercial reactor fuel and safe storage of plutonium removed from Russian weapons. It has also helped underwrite new jobs for Russian nuclear scientists who might otherwise sell their talents to Iraq, Iran or Libya. 
 Last year Congress appropriated nearly $900 million for threat reduction programs in Russia and other former Soviet republics. In the presidential campaign, Mr. Bush expressed strong support for these efforts and promised a substantial increase in their funding. Earlier this year a bipartisan task force headed by former Senator Howard Baker called for spending up to $30 billion on them over the next decade. But yesterday The Wall Street Journal reported that the administration's budget makers were instead preparing to impose substantial cuts.
Not all the programs in Russia have been equally effective. Finding commercial projects to keep nuclear scientists employed has been difficult, and efforts to dispose of Russian and American bomb-grade plutonium have been slow in getting started. But one of the programs now in line for big reductions is the highly successful effort to keep track of and secure nuclear material at Russian bomb sites before it is removed and rendered harmless.
The administration should conduct a careful review, identifying those programs that need to be strengthened or have their funding shifted to more effective efforts. But overall spending in this area should be increased, not decreased. It would be a dangerously false economy to slow the dismantling of Russian weapons.

HEADLINE: The Times Will Publish Personal Ads 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
The New York Times Company announced yesterday that for the first time in its history, it would print personal advertising. The ads will appear in certain Sunday sections of The Times.
 Starting April 22, advertisements from readers seeking romance will run in the five regional Sunday news sections: The City section and the weeklies published for readers in Long Island, Connecticut, Westchester and New Jersey. 
 The announcement comes as advertising sales for The Times and many newspapers have declined, mostly because of the slowing economy. The Times's advertising volume for February was down 6.9 percent, compared with February 2000. 
The company recently raised the Times's Sunday newsstand price and the rate for home delivery. 
"It's been a challenging period for advertising, but adding personal ads is something that's been under consideration for a while," said Kathy Park, a company spokeswoman. The newspaper has tested the waters by selling classified greeting ads on holidays, she said.
Douglas M. Arthur, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter specializing in the newspaper industry, said of the move, "With pressure on other forms of classified advertising these days, it makes sense that The Times is expanding its definition and including personals." 
The Times has a partnership with Advanced Telecom to operate the phone services for the personals, to screen clients and to take their ad requests. These would then be sent to the paper's advertising acceptability department, which will accept only ads "in line with the integrity of the rest of our classified advertising section," Ms. Park said. "Any language or phrasing that is suggestive or in questionable taste in the opinion of The Times will be declined." 
Other major newspapers, including The Washington Post, have accepted such ads for some time. In the New York region, suburban papers including Newsday on Long Island print them, as do many city publications, including The Village Voice and The New York Observer. 
The Times's regional sections reach 1.2 million readers. The paper's national circulation is 1.1 million daily and 1.7 million on Sundays.

HEADLINE: Energy Crisis Dims Small-Business Hopes 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 30 

 BODY:
The lights stay off at Espresso Bravo until well past dusk these days, and in the back of the cafe, where four refrigerators for soft drinks and juice used to stand, there are two. By next month, there will be none.
 "I'll just sell coffee," the owner, Sultan Alkhraisat, said with a shrug. 
 Mr. Alkhraisat, whose customers call him Sam, opened the cafe three years ago on a street in the city's working-class Mission District. When Internet entrepreneurs started moving in about a year ago, he thought Espresso Bravo, the biggest of five cafes he owns or co-owns in San Francisco, would be his best shot at achieving the American Dream. 
But the Internet people left, while his utility bills keep going up. With the electric bills double what they were a year ago, and gas bills more than double what they were just three months ago, Mr. Alkhraisat has had to lay off three employees, shut off six refrigerators and work seven days a week, 16 hours a day. He averages $850 a month in utility bills per cafe, is selling two of them and is seriously considering closing shop altogether.
"I am," he said, "between the ocean and the fire."
So are many small businesses throughout California that depend heavily on electricity and natural gas. After the record increase of up to 46 percent approved by the state's power managers on Tuesday, businesses that rely on a strong supply of electric and natural gas -- bakeries, restaurants, dry cleaners, coin launderies and hair salons, to name a fraction -- are in a kind of shock, as if just told that they have a potentially fatal illness.
The energy managers, the Public Utilities Commission, said the highest increases, based on a tiered rate system to go into effect in May, would go to "electricity hogs." That designation includes small businesses that need to soak up energy to run. 
For many of these businesses, the new rates mean hard choices. They may have to shut down some equipment to conserve energy, risking a loss in sales. They may have to raise their prices, risking a loss of customers. They may have to shut down altogether.
The Public Utilities Commission said that nearly half the customers of the two utility companies that were granted the rate increase would not see an increase in their bills. This figure is disputed by one of the companies, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, which estimated that 70 percent of customers would see an increase. 
But whether a household's electric bills go up or by how much, interviews with about two dozen small businesses in two cities, San Francisco and Fresno, underscore that the rate increases will affect everyone in California.
Consumers will feel the effects in higher prices for everything from auto repairs to bread to haircuts. Communities will experience the jolt if businesses that offer basic goods and services pack up and go. Cities could see a loss in their tax bases.
For Miguel Echevarria, who runs El Bueno Sabor Taqueria, a taco stand with four tables, utility bills have reached $1,000 a month, while his burritos, the mainstay of his business, remain at under $4 to stay competitive with all the other taquerias in the Mission District. Mr. Echevarria keeps his lights off all day, but has to run the oven and refrigerators, and he is not sure he can handle another increase. 
"It is only temporary, isn't it?" asked Mr. Echevarria, who speaks only Spanish and has not followed the energy crisis in the news.
When told the rate increases were permanent, he grimaced and said, "We'll just have to see if we sink or stay just above the water."
Dave Goodmon, owner of Goodmon's Auto Repair in Fresno, is planning to raise his prices. "I'm going to raise my rates starting Monday morning," Mr. Goodmon said.
His utility bills, he said, will rise to $450 from $275 a month for running compressors and lifts.
After 23 years in business in the same location, Mr. Goodmon does not want to entertain the idea that he may have to leave. "You don't want to hear what I think about the rate increase," he said. "I'm not a very nice person about that."
Rick Petty, who has owned Blackstone Tire and Service in Fresno since 1989, also plans to raise prices. 
"The electricity costs more to run all my machinery, to run all my compressors," Mr. Petty said. "I have to pass it on to the consumer, just like all the other businesses. Some of my vendors right now are already passing on a surcharge to me that they're relating back to the electricity problems." 
For businesses that relied on Internet enterprises, these are doubly hard times. The Sheirling Salon, a hair and skin care salon and spa in what became known as Media Gulch in San Francisco, for all the Internet magazines there, has seen business drop by 15 percent in the last few months, just as utility bills have skyrocketed.
"It affects us a lot," said Jereny Blas, the manager. "We have to use hair dryers. We have to do laundry. We do everything in-house. Our operating expenses are up, so we added two dollars to all of our services." 
The salon turns off all lights at night (for security reasons, it used to leave lights on) and uses candles instead of lights in the retail area during the day.
Still, with bills ever higher and profits down, the salon has filed for Chapter 11.
"We have to really think if we should stay open for business," Mr. Blas said.
Every single business operator interviewed wonders the same.
"I think the store has to close," said Michelle Tong, who has run New Star Cleaners, a tiny wash-and-fold laundry business in Pacific Heights here, for 10 years.
Ms. Tong cannot afford to raise prices by more than 5 cents a pound to stay competitive, but will not make up the increase in her utility bills.
"It's really terrible," she said. "Too expensive for small business."
Mr. Alkhraisat is trying all he can to reduce energy use and still make a profit. At Espresso Bravo on Thursday, he unveiled a salad bar -- nothing to heat, and no extra refrigeration. He plans to hook his espresso machine to a generator so he does not have to rely on the power company. Still, the energy price increases have made him reconsider the dream he brought when he moved here from Jordan eight years ago. 
Now, he said, at age 33, he is thinking of training to become a fireman. He pulled an application from his pocket to show it was no joke.
"Firemen," he said, "make a decent salary, and they don't have to worry about the utility bills."

HEADLINE: 30 Villagers Presumed Dead After Paramilitary Raid in Colombia 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, March 30 

 BODY:
A right-wing paramilitary group that terrorizes villagers began what might be its most audacious assault of the year by marching into a small southern town on Saturday and seizing 30 people, the governor of Narino Province said today. The villagers, who were accused of collaborating with leftist guerrillas, are generally believed to be dead.
 Gov. Parmenio Cuellar told a group of reporters here today that the gunmen arrived in Llorente, a town that had seen little violence until the coca trade took hold in recent months. Mr. Cuellar also said security forces did not arrive until Thursday, five days after the 200 to 300 raiders had come and gone. 
 The raid was seen by Mr. Cuellar and human rights officials in Bogota as a byproduct of the extensive American-backed fumigation of coca fields in neighboring Putumayo Province. Officials in Narino have said the aerial spraying, which began in December, had displaced coca growers, as well as leftist rebels and paramilitary gunmen, sending them to the once quiet region around Llorente.
"We've been saying for eight months that Narino was at the epicenter of the growing conflict and that Narino and other regions near Putumayo were in danger of paramilitary or guerrilla incursions," said Jorge Rojas, director of Codhes, a leading human rights group here. "Nevertheless, no one acted."
Details about what occurred in Llorente remained sketchy. A spokesman for the military, Col. Paulino Coronado, confirmed that 30 people had been taken away by members of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, including about 25 men. If all 30 are killed, the raid will be the most violent of dozens of paramilitary massacres this year. In January, paramilitary forces entered a northern town, Chengue, and killed at least 25 people.
Colonel Coronado confirmed that the military did not respond until Thursday. He said the units "could not arrive because they were covering other areas."
The raiders arrived between 4 and 5 a.m. on March 24, rousing people out of bed and herding residents into a small shabby plaza. A man who was in Llorente when the gunmen arrived said in a telephone interview today that he was among the residents led into the plaza at gunpoint. 
The raiders remained for six or seven hours, questioning residents and going through houses, the man said. He added that the gunmen had also forced a handful of residents to single out those who had collaborated with the rebels. 
"They took them away," the man said. "They put a knife and a gun to them and told them to move on. It was terrible. This had never happened to us."
Llorente, in a lowland jungle area not far from the Pacific, has gone from an isolated dirt-poor community to a boomtown in a few months with the influx of former coca farmers from Putumayo, coca laboratory workers and others drawn by a robust economy flush with coca money.
There is no permanent presence of the police or military. The closest unit is a Marine battalion in Tumaco, a 30-minute trip from the seaside. An army battalion is farther away, in Ipiales in the mountains.
Colonel Coronado said military officials remained unclear over who had jurisdiction in Llorente, the Marines or the army.
Mr. Rojas said the failure to protect the town or arrive more rapidly underscored the contentions in a recent United Nations report that harshly criticized human rights problems in Colombia. The report, by the high commissioner for human rights, said warnings about paramilitary attacks against defenseless villagers often went unheeded.
Human rights groups say the paramilitary groups are responsible for most of the massacres in Colombia.

HEADLINE: Clinton Energy-Saving Rules Are Getting a Second Look 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30 

 BODY:
The Energy Department is reviewing energy efficiency standards, issued in the last weeks of the Clinton administration, that would require new clothes washers, water heaters and central air-conditioners to use less electricity and natural gas. 
 A spokesman for the department, Joseph H. Davis, confirmed that the new standards were under review, as part of an effort ordered by the White House to look at all regulations published in the last 60 days of the Clinton administration. People involved in the review said the standard under closest scrutiny was the one governing air-conditioners; if left standing, it would save the most electricity and reduce pollution from power plants the most, but would also impose the greatest costs. 
 The rule requires that beginning in 2006, new central air-conditioners (and also central heat pumps, which can heat or cool) run on 30 percent less electricity than under current minimum standards of efficiency. In negotiations that led to the rule, the manufacturers had pressed for improvement of only 20 percent. A lawsuit against the new standard has been filed by their trade association, the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute, which calls the extra cost of building more efficient machines a "cruel penalty" on consumers, to whom those costs would be passed on. 
When the rule was written last year, however, its backers called it a bargain for consumers, and they are even more strongly in support now that the price of electricity has been rising.
The new standards for washers, water heaters and air-conditioners were adopted to meet the requirements of a federal law. That legislation was adopted by Congress fully 14 years ago, but, as the Energy Department sat down to work out the details, Congress blocked the regulations in the mid-1990's.
When the air-conditioner rule was finally issued this Jan. 17, Bill Richardson, the departing energy secretary, said the resulting reduction in energy bills and in pollution from power plants would be "one of the biggest environmental achievements of the Clinton administration." 
Now, though, that rule and the others are getting a second look. Staff members at the Energy Department say the agency's acting general counsel has asked them to prepare memorandums addressing whether the benefits of each of the rules might have been overstated or the costs understated, whether they could be considered an "overreach" and whether they pose a potential for litigation. The staff is also looking into whether any procedural errors were made in the rules' adoption. 
Bush administration officials say they can rescind any rule not yet in force.
"It would be irresponsible and wrong," said Mr. Davis, the Energy Department spokesman, "if the administration, newly elected and sworn into office, couldn't review regulations that have yet to take effect."
Some opponents, however, maintain that with the rules' publication in the Federal Register, the procedure would be more complicated. They also point to President Bush's depiction of "an energy crisis" in defense of his decision to oppose limiting power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, and to his call for more energy drilling and more use of "clean coal" technologies.
Dan W. Reicher, who was assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy in the Clinton administration, said, "It's stunning that at the very moment the new administration is telling us there's an energy crisis, they would be looking at rolling back standards that will save us more energy than virtually anything else we've done in 20 years."
Mr. Reicher said the economics of the regulations looked even more favorable now, after a period of rising prices for natural gas and electricity, than when the rules were drafted last year.
Efficiency experts say that in California, air-conditioning consumes 28 percent of the electricity used during peak hours in summer, and that a standard that takes the low-efficiency models off the market would gradually reduce the need for new power plants.
But the industry argues that the cost could exceed $5 billion and that the pay-back period for consumers -- the length of time it would take for their cumulative electricity savings to equal the additional cost of a higher-efficiency air-conditioner -- would be 9 to 14 years. 
The politics of the clothes-washer standard is more complicated. The manufacturers' trade group, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, is pleading to keep the rule in place.
"The whole rationale" behind negotiations that led to that rule was that "the members wanted a standard which they could plan towards," said Edward C. Foley Jr., director of the group's major-appliance and supplier division. "Certainty is always better than uncertainty."
Under this rule, the improvements are to come in two stages, in 2004 and in 2007. The improvement in efficiency is put at 35 percent.
As for the water-heater standard, which applies to both electric and gas models, the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association petitioned the Energy Department earlier this month to revise it. If it is left to stand, water heaters will need more insulation and may require a U-shaped trap to stop hot water from rising up the pipe when no faucet is turned on, keeping the water in the heater until it is needed. Efficiency improvement is put at 5 to 9 percent.

HEADLINE: STEM CELLS YIELD PROMISING RESULTS 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS WADE 

 BODY:
The basis of a possible revolution in treating heart attack patients has been laid by three reports of using stem cells from bone marrow to repair heart tissue in animals. 
 In one of the studies, apparently functional heart tissue was regenerated from the injected cells, the first such success in some two decades of effort. In another, the stem cells morphed into new blood vessels that rescued the heart cells around the damaged area from their usual course of overgrowth and death. In the third, stem cells were used to strengthen pig hearts. 
 The three groups of researchers, based at Columbia University, New York Medical College in Valhalla, N.Y., the National Institutes of Health, and Osiris Therapeutics of Baltimore, said they were a year or more away from testing their animal techniques in people. Still, heart disease experts believe the stem cell work is highly promising. 
"The health care industry would be revolutionized if the treatment of heart failure could be moved from organ transplants down to cell transplants," said Dr. Mark Sussman, a heart researcher at the Children's Hospital and Research Foundation in Cincinnati.
The new research opened "some very exciting doors," Dr. Sussman said, but required considerable further work to make sure it was as promising as it seemed.
Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Harvard, who is the author of a leading textbook of cardiology, said the idea of putting stem cells into the heart to grow new heart muscle cells was "a very interesting approach."
If their animal techniques work the same way in people, the researchers say, people suffering a heart attack would be treated by having cells extracted from their bone marrow. The cells would be sorted and amplified, then injected either directly into the heart, or maybe just into the bloodstream, from which they would home in on damaged heart tissue and on the enlarged heart muscle cells that soon grow around it. 
It may even prove possible, though this concept has not yet been tested, to do no more than inject a heart attack patient with a cytokine, a natural protein that stimulates the bone marrow's stem cells to proliferate. The cells would home in on damaged heart tissue, and repair it. Biologists say it is too early to know if the blood-forming stem cells of the bone marrow are also the heart's own stem cells, which researchers have been seeking in vain for years, or if their remarkable ability to repair the heart is just a general property of stem cells.
Stem cells are unspecialized cells that can turn into the mature cells of the body while replenishing their own numbers so as to remain a constant source of new cells. The cells involved in the new reports are called adult stem cells, and differ from the controversial embryonic stem cells that generate the fetus and adult organism. 
The new results all depend on the recent finding that the stem cells of the bone marrow are far more versatile than supposed and can generate other tissues besides the red and white blood cells, their best-known function. It seems that the cells are a kind of universal clay, so responsive to local cues that if placed in the heart they will develop into heart tissue instead of blood cells. 
In one of the new reports, published in this month's Nature Medicine, Dr. Silviu Itescu and colleagues at Columbia University say they isolated a special kind of stem cell from human bone marrow. The cells, which they call angioblasts, are a subset of the blood-forming stem cells that make the red and white blood cells. Angioblasts generate the cells of the fine blood vessels. Although their existence had been inferred, they had not been isolated before, Dr. Itescu said.
After a heart attack, caused by blockage of one of the heart's own arteries, the muscle cells that were deprived of oxygen die off and the cells around them grow four or five times larger to compensate for the damaged tissue. That is why most people survive a heart attack. But the overgrown cells themselves start to die after a time, and are replaced by scar tissue. The heart then starts to fail.
Dr. Itescu said that his team thought the overgrown muscle cells might be dying for lack of an adequate blood supply, a point that could be proved if the cells could be rescued with a new blood supply. This was their rationale for learning how to isolate the angioblast cells.
They then injected human angioblasts into rats in which heart attacks had been induced by tying off a coronary artery. For reasons not yet understood, stem cells are much better tolerated by the immune system than other foreign cells. Injected into the rats' bloodstream, the human angioblasts homed in on the damaged heart tissue. Dr. Itescu said he had identified the signaling chemical emitted by the damaged heart cells, but declined to name it because he has not yet published his description of the work. 
The human angioblasts generated blood vessels within the damaged rat hearts and prevented the overgrown heart muscle cells from dying. The left ventricle's efficiency plunges after a heart attack, but in the treated rats it recovered by 30 percent 15 weeks after treatment, in step with the growth of new blood vessels.
Dr. Itescu said he hoped that clinical trials would begin in about a year, after he had done more rat experiments to define the safety and timing of a treatment protocol. 
In a commentary, Dr. Nadia Rosenthal, a heart researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital, called the Itescu team's success at growing new blood vessels a "remarkable accomplishment."
The second stem cell article, to be published in next week's Nature, was written by Dr. Piero Anversa of the New York Medical College in Valhalla and Dr. Donald Orlic of the National Institutes of Health and their colleagues. The Orlic-Anversa team purified cells from a donor mouse's bone marrow so as to isolate the most primitive stem cells and exclude those that had already taken the first steps toward becoming blood cells. The primitive stem cells were then injected directly into the hearts of other mice that had been given heart attacks by tying off an artery. 
The researchers found that the stem cells generated new heart tissue by maturing into different cells, including heart muscle cells, the smooth muscle cells of artery walls, and the cells that line the blood vessel walls. The mice's left ventricle efficiency was about 40 percent greater than that of untreated mice. This is the first time, Dr. Orlic said, that new heart tissue has been generated from injected cells. He and Dr. Anversa had expected to see just a few new heart muscle cells, and had gone to great trouble to label the donor cells with a fluorescent green protein so as to be able to tell them apart from the recipient's heart cells. 
"We never dreamed the cells could do this," Dr. Orlic said of the new heart tissue. 
Dr. Ronald McKay, an expert on neural stem cells at the National Institutes of Health and a coauthor of the Orlic-Anversa study, was also surprised by the new tissue formation.
"No one has ever seen this kind of thing before -- complete regeneration right across the graft site," Dr. McKay said.
Dr. Orlic and Dr. Anversa believe the new tissue is functional because the mouse hearts improved and the new cells produced a special protein typical of heart cells that have formed a connective network so as to beat in unison. Dr. Sussman said this was good but not conclusive evidence that the stem cells can make working heart tissue.
Still, Dr. Sussman wrote in a commentary in Nature, "The implications are profound: damage to the heart muscle after a heart attack might be reparable with specific bone marrow cells."
In a third experiment, described this month at a meeting at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, Dr. Robert Deans of Osiris Therapeutics said he had improved heart function in pigs by injecting stem cells into the region of a heart attack. The pig is large enough that the improvement in its heart function can be measured more precisely than in rodents. 
Dr. Deans used a second kind of stem cell found in the bone narrow, known as a mesenchymal stem cell. The cells usually mature into bone, cartilage and fat cells. Injected into the pigs' hearts, they developed into heart muscle cells. Dr. Deans said he hoped to begin a clinical trial of the technique in a year, probably on patients awaiting heart transplants so that the effect of implanted cells could be precisely measured after the old heart was removed.
Researchers have been trying for years to repair hearts by injecting different kinds of cells into them. Their persistent lack of success, Dr. Sussman said, may make others wary of the new claims at first. But the present options for treating heart failure are not so perfect: drugs to keep the heart limping along for some years and a transplant when it finally fails. 
"So it would be beautiful and also a phenomenal saving in economic terms and for people's quality of life if you could figure out a way to repair the existing heart," Dr. Sussman said. "I think this therapeutic approach, if it becomes viable, gives us an entirely new way of treating heart failure that did not exist before."

Merck to Lower the Price Of Two AIDS Drugs in Brazil
Merck has agreed to cut the price of two AIDS medicines in Brazil, bowing to pressure from that country's government, which threatened to develop generic versions of one of the drugs.
 The government has now turned the pressure on Hoffman-La Roche, which sells nelfinavir, a medicine also known by the brand name Viracept. The government said that it had been negotiating with Hoffman-La Roche on a price reduction, but that the talks had so far been unsuccessful. Page A4. 

Yen Falls Sharply Against the Dollar
Currency traders in Tokyo interpreted remarks by Japan's economy minister, Taro Aso, to mean that the United States was willing to let the yen weaken, and they obliged by pushing its value down 1.9 percent, to 125.52 to the dollar, a level not seen since October 1998. The yen has lost 9 percent against the dollar this year, and 2 percent against the euro. C2.

Toy Chain Buys Time on Financing
Zany Brainy, a toy store chain that has been struggling with an unwieldy acquisition and the difficult retail environment, bought itself more time to right its finances. Toy manufacturers owed money by the retailer agreed to give Zany Brainy until April 16 to find a new line of credit or renegotiate its bank loan. C2.

Anti-Tax Business Is Sued by I.R.S.
After months of ignoring several dozen business owners who boasted that they no longer withhold taxes from paychecks, the Internal Revenue Service has taken its first civil action against one of these companies. It has also sent letters to workers at these companies telling them that they must pay taxes, whether their bosses withhold them or not. C2.

Bush Officials Hurt by Stock Losses
A falling stock market is spelling trouble for a number of wealthy Bush administration officials who are selling their multimillion-dollar investment portfolios -- and taking some losses in the process -- to comply with government ethics rules. A1.

Britain Rebukes Goldman, Sachs
A government report in Britain sharply rebuked Goldman, Sachs and other financial institutions for their involvement with Robert Maxwell, the flamboyant tycoon whose death a decade ago provoked the collapse of a trans-Atlantic media empire that included The Daily News of New York. The report -- almost nine years in the making at a cost of some $14 million -- said Goldman, Sachs bore "substantial responsibility" in the manipulation that occurred in the market. C2.

Suits Filed in Infant Formula Dispute
A dispute over infant formulas resulted in two lawsuits. Mead Johnson, the maker of Enfamil, sued a distributor of generic formula, PBM Products, contending that PBM was making false and misleading statements about Enfamil. Then, PBM sued Mead Johnson, contending that Mead Johnson inaccurately asserted that Enfamil was safer and healthier than generic formula. C14.

Energy Standards Are Under Review
The Energy Department is reviewing energy efficiency standards issued in the last weeks of the Clinton administration that would require new clothes washers, water heaters and central air-conditioners to do their work with less electricity and natural gas, according to administration officials. The review is part of an effort ordered by the White House to look at all regulations published in the last 60 days of the Clinton administration. A11.

GE Capital in $1.4 Billion Deal
GE Capital, the financial arm of General Electric, agreed to buy the Franchise Finance Corporation of America for $1.4 billion in cash, expanding its lending to Burger King, 7-Eleven, Midas Muffler and other franchises. GE Capital will also assume $700 million of debt. C3.

HEADLINE: Tracing Anti-Abortion Network To a Slaying Suspect in France 

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
He was calling himself Clyde Swenson at the time. He was living in Jersey City and working in construction, occasionally flashing hints of his keen intelligence and religious fervor. Most mornings he attended 7 o'clock Mass before lugging an ammunition box filled with carpentry tools to the job site.
 Then late one night in October 1998, in a suburb of Buffalo about 400 miles away, a bullet fired from a high-powered rifle pierced a kitchen window to kill Dr. Barnett A. Slepian, an obstetrician who performed abortions. Soon afterward, the man called Swenson vanished from Jersey City, leaving behind little more in his apartment than some trash from a Taco Bell and a calendar from a funeral home. 
 Federal agents spent the next two and a half years searching the world for him, convinced that he had pulled the trigger. To find him, about all they had to go on were his real name, James C. Kopp, and his ties to the country's loose-knit group of violent anti-abortion activists. 
Several weeks ago, the agents learned that he was in Ireland, living under another alias and working sporadically as a clerk -- for a time at a Dublin hospital where he adorned his desk with religious statuettes. But by the time the Irish authorities pinpointed his whereabouts, he had vanished again.
Then, on Thursday, French police officers descended upon a post office in Dinan, a town in Brittany, to arrest a gaunt, hollow-eyed man in a frayed sport shirt who had just picked up a package from New York that contained $300. The man was Mr. Kopp.
"He did not look good," Christian Guillot, a manager at the post office, said, adding: "He would start out in French, then there would be a word of English, then Spanish. He was nice, but it was pretty hard to help him. We couldn't figure out what he was talking about."
The arrest of Mr. Kopp, 46, was made possible in large part by the communication he kept with those from his past: two anti-abortion activists in Brooklyn who were charged on Thursday with plotting to help Mr. Kopp slip back into the United States. 
One is Dennis John Malvasi, 51, who was convicted in 1987 of bombing an abortion clinic in Manhattan and trying to bomb a second clinic in Queens. The other is Loretta Claire Marra, 37, figuratively shackled to Mr. Kopp today, just as she was literally shackled to him 10 years ago.
In fact, a law enforcement official said yesterday, "We were looking for Loretta Marra shortly after the event in Buffalo."
According to an F.B.I. complaint, Mr. Kopp and Ms. Marra have known each other since at least February 1990, when they were arrested at an anti-abortion protest in Vermont and jailed for two months. 
There were other shared arrests. For example, in November 1991, Mr. Kopp and Ms. Marra shackled themselves to a heavy metal object outside the door of an abortion clinic in Levittown, N.Y. The object was so difficult to crack, Sgt. Gregory Friedrich recalled yesterday, that the police placed the two protesters on a cart, wheeled them into a van and took them to the Emergency Service Bureau office in Garden City, where they finally cut it open with an abrasive saw.
Both protesters were later convicted on misdemeanor charges. And for years afterward, the Nassau County police kept the metallic object as a training tool in case the protesters returned.
The level of Mr. Kopp's involvement in anti-abortion activity through most of the 1990's is unclear, although he is a suspect in three nonfatal ambushes of doctors in Canada and one in a Rochester suburb. At the very least, he was living under an assumed name in Jersey City for several months before disappearing.
Then, in the weeks and months after the shooting death of Dr. Slepian in 1998, federal authorities pieced together a case for the arrest of Mr. Kopp.
Mr. Kopp was linked to the murder scene by fibers found in his Chevrolet Cavalier -- seen in Dr. Slepian's neighborhood days before the shooting and later found at Newark International Airport -- and by a single strand of hair. 
That led investigators to begin exploring the country's network of anti-abortion activists, the law enforcement official said. "And so Loretta's name surfaced."
At first, investigators could not find Ms. Marra, according to the F.B.I. complaint. In fact, just four months after the murder, Mr. Malvasi told a federal grand jury in Buffalo that he did not know Mr. Kopp, but he refused to answer whether he knew Ms. Marra. Finally, in October 1999, F.B.I. agents spotted Ms. Marra with Mr. Malvasi in front of an apartment building in East New York, Brooklyn.
Mr. Kopp's whereabouts during the first 17 months after the Slepian shooting remains unclear; at one point investigators announced that they believed he might be in Mexico. After his capture this week, though, federal investigators said that they believed Mr. Kopp had been living in Ireland at least since March 2000.
John Farrelly, the chief superintendent for the Garda, the police force in Ireland, said that Mr. Kopp might have chosen Ireland -- a country in which abortion is illegal -- because he could blend in among the many immigrants seeking work in the booming Irish economy. He said Mr. Kopp was believed to have lived mostly in Dublin, where he spent time at hostels in the city center and on its outskirts, in Blackrock, with a group of dissident Roman Catholics.
Mr. Kopp is believed to have held several jobs during his time in Ireland, including a short stint this year at the City of Dublin Skin and Cancer Hospital on Hume Street. Laura Ryan, a correspondent for TV-3 in Dublin, said last night that co-workers told her Mr. Kopp walked with a pronounced limp, decorated his desk with religious statuettes and once carried in a chain saw that he told colleagues was for a class he was taking at night.
Last night, the hospital issued a statement saying that the "person we now know to be James Charles Kopp" was a clerk hired to type routine reports.
It said Mr. Kopp had been hired through a "reputable staff recruitment agency." The agency, it said, has said that his references "appeared to be bona fide," although Superintendent Farrelly said those references were fake. 
The hospital said in its statement that Mr. Kopp was dismissed on Feb. 2 after five days of employment. It did not state a reason.
Around that same time, Mr. Malvasi was being honored for his violent work in behalf of the anti-abortion movement. In late January, he traveled to a Comfort Inn in Bowie, Md., to attend the White Rose Banquet. Its founder, the Rev. Michael Bray, said the annual event recognized those who are serving prison time for anti-abortion activity.
Mr. Bray, pastor of the Reformation Lutheran Church in Bowie, said that a feature of the banquet was an auction to raise money for the imprisoned. For example, he said, Paul Hill, convicted for the 1994 killings of a doctor who performed abortions and his escort in Florida, sent along a letter listing the Ten Commandments. Mr. Malvasi's contributions to the charity auction, Mr. Bray said, included the watch he used as a timing device in a bombing attempt in the 1980's.
"You can understand the level of levity here," Mr. Bray said. He added that the items sold for amounts up to $100.
Unbeknownst to Mr. Malvasi, by this point federal officials had received court approval to monitor telephone conversations and e-mail transmissions at the Brooklyn apartment that he shared with Ms. Marra, and were privy to plans that seemed designed to spirit Mr. Kopp back into the United States. 
Then earlier this month, things went wrong -- for everybody. 
Mr. Kopp had stopped responding to messages left for him in a special e-mail account. On March 8, the authorities say, Ms. Marra left a draft message for him with the heading: "Getting Worried." It read: "What's going on, anyhow? Haven't heard from you in ages. Please let me know how you are."
At about the same time, F.B.I. agents were interviewing people at the Dublin hospital, and the Irish police had learned from their contacts that Mr. Kopp was living somewhere in the city center. 
Then, on March 12, Mr. Kopp left Ireland. "He felt the heat in Ireland," said Hardrick Crawford Jr., the F.B.I.'s acting special agent in charge of the Buffalo office. "He felt their warm breath on his neck."
On March 15, The Irish Mirror reported that Mr. Kopp was in Ireland -- a report that the F.B.I. played down. On March 16, the F.B.I. complaint said, Mr. Kopp mailed, from Paris to the apartment in Brooklyn, a package that contained two Irish birth certificates and a blank Irish passport. 
But on March 21, the biggest break of all came: a message from France left in the shared e-mail account, asking that Ms. Marra and Mr. Malvasi send money to a "Jean Aubrigon" at the post office in Dinan, Brittany.
On Thursday, an unfamiliar and disheveled man went to the post office in Dinan. 
"He was looking for money, waiting for money," recalled Mr. Guillot, the post office employee. "But he did not get it."

To the Editor:
 "As Seattle's Economy Slows, Many Like the Change of Pace" (front page, March 29) should serve as a reminder that economic growth does not always make us happier. 
 Open spaces and an unpolluted environment are sometimes more important than an impressive gross domestic product. So, too, are the senses of tradition, community and belonging that rapid development too often has a way of stripping from us. 
Progress has costs, to be sure. But as a country and as individuals, we must be careful not to get so caught up in the pursuit of prosperity that we no longer think about what success really means.

HEADLINE: Pataki Names State Official As Port Authority's Chief 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday named Neil D. Levin, the superindent of New York State's Insurance Department and a former investment banker, as the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
 If Mr. Levin is confirmed by the agency's 12-member board at a scheduled meeting on Thursday, he will become the 80-year-old agency's 12th executive director, succeeding Robert E. Boyle, who announced his resignation in December from the $185,000-a-year post. The Port Authority operates the region's three major airports, port facilities, bridge and tunnel crossings and the World Trade Center. 
 Governor Pataki called Mr. Levin, 47, "a leader who knows how to get things done," and cited his experience as a senior executive in both the public and private sector.
Mr. Levin said in a statement that he would "work efficiently and in the most cost-effective manner to build and operate a transportation network so vital to the region." He said he would not comment on agency operations or on any changes he might seek until he was confirmed.
In Mr. Levin, Governor Pataki would get an official who, like Mr. Boyle, has been seen as a loyal and trusted ally and manager rather than an ideologue or political operative.
New York's governor traditionally names the Port Authority's executive director, while New Jersey's governor names the agency's board chairman. The governors have usually cleared their appointments with each other before announcing them.
Mr. Pataki came in for some criticism in 1995 with his first appointee to head the authority, George Marlin, a former Conservative Party official, because he had not coordinated the appointment with the New Jersey governor.
Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for New Jersey's acting governor, Donald T. DiFrancesco, said that Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Levin had met within the past week and that Mr. DiFrancesco had expressed his confidence in Mr. Levin in a joint press release with Governor Pataki.
A native of Atlantic Beach, Mr. Levin received an undergraduate degree in economics from Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, an M.B.A. in finance from C. W. Post Center of Long Island University and a law degree from Hofstra University. In 1981, when he was just out of law school, Mr. Levin got a job as Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's legislative assistant for banking and securities. From 1983 to 1985, Mr. Levin was chief counsel of the committee's subcommittee on securities.
Mr. Levin left government for the private sector in 1985 and went to Goldman Sachs, where he eventually became a vice president in the firm's financial institutions group. He was named the Pataki administration's first banking superintendent in 1995. In 1997, he was named to the insurance post.
State Senator James Seward of New York called Mr. Levin's appointment to the Port Authority post "a natural choice in that he has a very good working relationshiip with the governor."
If approved by the Port Authority board, Mr. Levin would take over an agency that recently emerged from months of disagreement between the New York and New Jersey governors, which blocked action on many projects. Since the resolution of the disagreements last June, the agency has reached accords on new leases for expanded port activities, airport improvement programs, and raising bridge and tunnel tolls and PATH fares.
The announcement that Mr. Boyle would be stepping down was made around nine months after he was named in a civil suit filed by New York's attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, who said that Mr. Boyle had illegally profited from real estate transactions involving a suburban hospital of which he was board chairman.

YEN PLUNGES AGAINST DOLLAR

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Currency traders in Tokyo interpreted remarks by Japan's economy minister, Taro Aso, to mean that the United States was willing to let the yen weaken, and they obliged by pushing its value down 1.9 percent, to 125.52 to the dollar, a level not seen since October 1998. The yen has lost 9 percent of its value against the dollar this year, and 2 percent against the euro.

CALIFORNIA: SECOND OFFICER PLEADS GUILTY -- A second Los Angeles policeman has agreed to a plea deal and will help an investigation of abuses at an antigang unit. The officer, Nino Durden, said he and his partner had shot an unarmed, handcuffed gang member. He pleaded guilty to state charges and is expected to receive nearly eight years in prison.

ROCKIES

COLORADO: COYOTES ARE SPARED -- Lawmakers killed a plan to shoot coyotes in western Colorado to see if they were responsible for a decline in mule deer. The Division of Wildlife had proposed the shootings because the state's deer population, roughly 545,000, is about 90,000 fewer than desired. Environmentalists had criticized the plan as a concession to hunters. (NYT)

TEXAS: O'HAIR KIDNAPPER SENTENCED -- David Waters, accused of devising a kidnapping scheme that ended in the murder of the atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair and two family members, was sentenced to 20 years in prison on a federal extortion charge. Mr. Waters, 54, admitted in January doing "physical violence" to Ms. O'Hair, 76, her son Jon Garth Murray, 40, and granddaughter Robin Murray O'Hair, 30. (AP)

INDIANA: STUDENT KILLED AT SCHOOL -- A 10th-grader was killed in a parking lot outside Lew Wallace High School in Gary by a 17-year-old former student who shot him in the head, the authorities said. The suspect admitted shooting the student, Neal Boyd, 16, the police chief, John Roby, said. The police said they did not know whether the boys knew each other; the motive was unclear. (AP)

INDIANA: PRE-ABORTION COUNSELING LAW STRUCK DOWN -- A federal judge struck down part of a state law requiring women to undergo in-person counseling a day before an abortion. Judge David Hamilton of Federal District Court ruled that not letting women obtain information about alternatives to abortion other than in person unlawfully impeded their right to end a pregnancy. (AP)

ILLINOIS: BILL TO RESTRICT PROSECUTORS GAINS -- The House of Representatives passed a bill raising the prosecutor's burden in criminal cases. It would make it harder to use jailhouse informants and make it easier to set aside convictions if prosecutors fail to share material evidence with defense lawyers. Pam Belluck (NYT)

SOUTH

MISSISSIPPI: GOVERNOR'S VETOES OVERRIDDEN -- Gov. Ronnie Musgrove vetoed about half the state's $3.6 billion general fund budget, warning legislators that their economic projections were too optimistic, but state lawmakers overrode the vetoes. They said the governor, a Democrat, could make cuts if the economy did not pick up. Mr. Musgrove particularly opposed plans to raise spending on privately run prisons, saying the state already had many empty prison beds. (NYT)

TENNESSEE: STUDENT DIED OF HAZING -- Joseph T. Green Jr., a Tennessee State University student who collapsed while jogging on Jan. 29, died as a result of fraternity hazing, a Nashville medical examiner ruled. Mr. Green, of Antioch, Tenn., was being initiated by Omega Psi Phi. He had heart and breathing problems and a temperature of 103.7 degrees before he died. Kevin Sack (NYT)

TENNESSEE: EXECUTION IS STAYED -- The State Supreme Court granted a reprieve to Philip Ray Workman 45 minutes before he was to die by lethal injection. The court voted 3 to 2 to stay the execution and ordered the trial court in Memphis to hold a hearing on whether new ballistics evidence could have led to a different verdict. Mr. Workman, 47, was convicted of killing Lt. Ronald Oliver after a restaurant robbery, but he has said Lieutenant Oliver was killed by another officer. Kevin Sack (NYT)

WASHINGTON

BUSH SWIFTLY FILLING POSTS -- After two months in office, President Bush has filled cabinet and top subcabinet positions at a pace faster than President Bill Clinton, said Paul C. Light of the Brookings Institution, who tracks the process. A total of 484 posts require Senate confirmation; 90 nominees have been announced, 25 others who have been confirmed and 18 have been formally nominated, with their paperwork submitted for review. Clay Johnson, Mr. Bush's personnel director, said the administration had chosen about 270 appointees, but many had not yet been announced. (NYT)

NO COLLUSION FOUND IN GAS PRICE RISE -- Some energy producers withheld supplies of gasoline to maximize profits last summer, but there is no evidence that companies conspired to raise gas prices, the Federal Trade Commission has concluded. The F.T.C. said that a variety of factors, including many beyond the control of producers and marketers, were partly responsible for gasoline prices that soared beyond $2 a gallon in parts of the Midwest.

HEADLINE: Westchester's 10-Mile Strip Mall; 
Commerce Crowds One Corridor to Keep Suburbs Tidy

BYLINE:  By JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: GREENBURGH, N.Y., March 30 

 BODY:
The ugliest 10 miles in Westchester County, Central Park Avenue, runs from the Bronx border to White Plains and is lined with indistinguishable strip malls, superstores and fast-food joints.
 This charmless commercial corridor is everything that Westchester County aspires not to be. It is home to the sort of development that would be cursed in Croton, despised in Dobbs Ferry and litigated in Larchmont. 
 So why put up with it?
The answer, planners and residents agree, is that Central Avenue, as it is known, allows Westchester to be Westchester: a lush suburban area with little of the homogeneous sprawl of Long Island or New Jersey. A collection of 39 towns and villages that fiercely defend their idiosyncratic charms. A place where Nimby battles rage over Ikea, Stew Leonard's or other stores like them -- unless they happen to be on Central Avenue. 
"Aesthetically, it's a disaster," said Anthony Cupaiuolo, a professor of public administration at Pace University. "On the other hand, it's very functional. It allows us to have our cake and eat it too."
From its southern terminus, where it melts into the New York State Thruway near the sad husk of Yonkers Raceway, to its end point at the utilitarian County Center, Central Avenue is a place to study the county's evolving retail and culinary tastes, its patterns of immigration and its deep loyalty to institutions that may seem fusty to newcomers but mean the world to those raised here.
"It's a magnet," said Charles M. Feuer, 56, a real estate lawyer who grew up in Larchmont, broke in his driver's license on Central Avenue and still travels from Armonk to shop here. "It draws you back because it brings back the past."
The commercial strip began to take shape in 1956, with the opening of Korvettes in the Midway Shopping Center, one of the oldest malls in the region. The Grand Concourse in the Bronx was fading and an exodus was in the making, both of residents and of retailers seeking greener pastures.
Korvettes drew housewives looking for bargain lingerie and teenagers in search of cheap 45's. Eventually Korvettes gave way to Mays and then to the Burlington Coat Factory, establishing a pattern that survives today, with older chains morphing into the Wiz, Bed Bath & Beyond and Today's Man -- not big changes in the arc of time.
But trends emerge, consistent with the breeding and nesting habits of today's families. These days, stores catering to 30-somethings with young children cannot open fast enough: Zany Brainy, Buy Buy Baby and Babies "R" Us, all within blocks. The same is true of furniture stores. "You can buy leather couches in 42 different styles," said Elliott Sclar, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University who lives in Larchmont.
In cuisine, as in retail, newcomers are often updated variations of their predecessors. Adventurers' Inn, with kiddie rides and hot dogs, was replaced by Nathan's. There were once two diners on a rocky promontory in Yonkers. Only one remains, Mont Olympus, still a comforting cliche, with round-the-clock breakfast and bottomless cups of coffee.
Mont Olympus, and its sister restaurant, Mont Parnasse in Greenburgh, coexist peaceably in the new world of T.G.I. Friday's, Pizza and Brew and even the City Limits, a faux diner that turns cooking into cuisine. But only for the real diners, these two owned by Elias Lurentzatos, do hardy loyalists come from as far as Riverdale or Rockland County. 
Here, literally at ground level, Mr. Lurentzatos sees the first flicker of social change. Once diners were teenage hangouts. But they lost the high school crowd, he said, when smoking was banned, jukeboxes lost their allure and cellular phones replaced pay telephones as a way to summon friends and reassure parents.
Economic upheaval also announces itself in mundane ways. The failing Japanese economy has taken its toll at Meidi-Ya, a convenience store selling everything from seaweed to Japanese-language videos. In the late 1980's, stores like this bustled because of an influx of Japanese businessmen with rich living allowances. Now, the market is quiet, except around a bulletin board where those transferring back to Japan advertise houses and cars, and those staying behind promote yard sales to supplement their incomes.
Since its opening in 1871, when it took a horse and buggy five hours to travel the dirt road end to end, Central Avenue, or Route 100, has been shaped by southern Westchester's particular history and topography. In the metropolitan area's oldest suburb, settlement followed the north-south paths of the Hudson River, the stage-coach lines and the railroad, not the automobile.
With the railroad station as village green and rivers, valleys and ridge lines as natural barriers to sprawl, the county is defined by small, distinctive communities and cumbersome east-west travel. As a result, at least before the opening of the Westchester, a glittering indoor mall, Central Avenue was the sole regional mecca for commerce, attracting people from both sides of the county. 
"We draw pretty equally," said Lyle Steinberg, the second-generation owner of two shopping centers on Central Avenue, just about the only part of Westchester that is permitted -- no, encouraged -- to look like Anywhere U.S.A.
Mr. Steinberg's family owned plenty of land here but strategically located their businesses near the intersection of Ardsley Road. This is the only east-west street for miles around, changing names, doglegging this way and that, but finally connecting the Hudson River side of the county and Long Island Sound.
Both of Mr. Steinberg's shopping centers are in the town of Greenburgh, one of three municipalities, along with Yonkers and White Plains, on Central Avenue. Different jurisdictions mean different sales taxes, different sources of money for road improvements and different attitudes toward controlling helter-skelter development.
In other ways, though, Central Avenue transcends Westchester's ZIP code pecking order.
For example, while you can get status points for living in the part of Yonkers with a Bronxville post office, fancy addresses mean nothing on Central Avenue. The Fine Arts Theater, Westchester's only art house, has a Scarsdale P.O. But Meyer Ackerman, owner of the movie theater that opened in 1972 with Peter O'Toole in "The Ruling Class," is certain it makes no difference. 
The theater draws film buffs who line up outdoors in all kinds of bad weather, with no complaint about a lobby too small to hold them or a pathetic candy stand. One sees the same faces every weekend. The test of die-hard Fine Arts patrons is whether they know the back way to the theater, bypassing most of Central Avenue's tackiness.
But not all tackiness is created equal. The same aesthetes who shun the multiplexes in Yonkers, where noisy teenagers predominate and the streetscape is solid neon, flock to an unremarkable Carvel stand, one of three on Central Avenue, that is deemed a local treasure.
As legend has it, recounted by Abdol Faghihi, owner of the stand, Tom Carvel lived at this location in 1934, behind the store where the frozen-custard craze was born. Mr. Faghihi's eyes gleam, one immigrant entrepreneur appreciating another. The Carvel empire grew to 700 stands, worth $80 million when the business changed hands in 1989. Mr. Carvel was the first to sell franchises, like the KFC's, Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's that line Central Avenue. His awkward commercials -- "Buy one, get one free" -- entered the language. 
Mr. Faghihi's stand is flanked by Noodle Kidoodle and Barnes & Noble. When the toy store opened, ice cream sales shot up. When the bookstore added a Starbucks, sales fell. Eventually things returned to normal. At this time of year, a trickle of parents buy birthday cakes during the day, and there is modest after-dinner traffic. Summers are a different matter, with lines from morning until night.
The ebb and flow is a reminder that while fashions on Central Avenue change, some things are forever, like the joy of cruising to Carvel in a cool car.
Witness Richard Cohen of Scarsdale, middle-aged, divorced and a technical supervisor at CBS Sports. In a 1980 MG, he was out buying blinds the other afternoon and couldn't resist a half-and-half cone, that unmistakable swirl of vanilla and chocolate, delicious even on a blustery day.

HEADLINE: SECURITY FORCES IN BELGRADE STORM MILOSEVIC'S HOUSE 

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Saturday, March 31 

 BODY:
After a night of conflicting reports that Slobodan Milosevic had been arrested on corruption charges, Serbian special forces stormed his residence before dawn today, beginning the legal process that could finally imprison the man whose 13-year reign over Yugoslavia brought wars, destruction and poverty to his people. 
 About 2:30 a.m. local time, several carloads of black-clad special forces commandos drove up to the front gate of the compound where Mr. Milosevic lives, trying to force open the gate and firing several shots, which were met with fire from within the walls. At least one man was wounded. The men succeeded in crashing through the gatehouse, but by 4 a.m. they had not penetrated the walls of the compound. 
 As the attack subsided, police officials met with Milosevic and presented him with an arrest warrant, the Associated Press reported. But Milosevic refused to accept it, saying he did not "recognize these police and these authorities, all of them being NATO servants," an Interior Ministry source told the news agency. 
Shortly after daylight, police pushed all of the Milosevic supporters and journalists about a half-mile down a road away from the villa. More police arrived in the area and blocked off all roads leading to the compound. Some police officers suggested that a final operation would be under way. 
The Bush administration was informed at 5:30 Friday afternoon that Mr. Milosevic, who is wanted on international war crimes charges, was in custody on corruption charges, a senior administration official said tonight.
But as the evening progressed, the administration was receiving reports that he had been released, and officials said they were waiting to hear whether he was still in custody. Even later Friday night, the State Department was questioning whether he had been arrested at all. 
Adding to the confusion, Deputy Prime Minister Zarko Korac said that Mr. Milosevic had been arrested and taken to the Palace of Justice, the central court, sometime before midnight Friday, but that the government would not make an official statement until today. Serbian state television also reported the news, quoting officials.
Television footage showed four black police jeeps drawing up to the Palace of Justice's underground entrance, though the passengers were not visible through the darkened windows, but Mr. Milosevic was not seen leaving his residence, which was surrounded by supporters and journalists from early evening. 
Just a few hours later, Mr. Milosevic appeared at the gates of his house in the prosperous district of Dedinje to greet supporters. "I am not afraid," he told the Belgrade-based independent radio and television outlet B92. "I expect this story to end in a just manner and for the benefit of our people." He did not say whether he had been detained.
"I am just drinking coffee with my comrades and I am very well," he said. "In front of my house many have gathered who have our people and national dignity at heart. We are very proud." 
Then, at 2 a.m., 100 to 150 policemen in full riot gear appeared at the back entrance to the compound, trying to control the crowd and apparently clearing a path. Half an hour later they were followed by a van and cars carrying the special forces units.
Bush administration officials said Mr. Milosevic had not been arrested on charges of crimes against humanity, brought nearly two years ago in connection with war crimes committed by Yugoslav forces in Kosovo. If corruption charges are brought against him, he will be tried locally. 
The Bush administration is deciding this weekend whether to certify Belgrade's compliance with conditions attached to the continuation of United States aid after a deadline of today. One factor the Bush administration will take into account for certification is the level of Belgrade's cooperation with the United Nations international war crimes tribunal at The Hague. This month, Yugoslavia has sent two indictees to The Hague for trial.
Congress appropriated $100 million for Yugoslavia last year. By now, about half has been dispersed. The rest, except for humanitarian aid, depends on certification. Failure to win it would be a blow to the Serbian government and its ailing economy, since the decision would also block financial assistance from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Early this month, the Bush administration gave Belgrade a list of actions that could aid certification. The first item read: "Arrest Milosevic and transfer him to prison." The administration is not demanding Mr. Milosevic's immediate transfer to The Hague, but his arrest and detention on charges of corruption or abuse of power would probably ensure certification.
Hundreds of Milosevic supporters rushed to take up guard around his house Friday evening, after members of his Socialist Party said that special police units and ambulances had arrived outside his residence to arrest him. 
The head of the Socialist parliamentary faction, Branislav Ivkovic, announced the arrest plans around 7 p.m. Friday during a televised session of the Serbian Parliament. Warning that Mr. Milosevic might be arrested, he called people to go to his house to defend him.
He and other officials arrived at the house, emerging later to tell supporters that Mr. Milosevic was inside and thanked the protesters for rallying to his defense. 
Several black jeeps with darkened windows were parked down the street from the back entrance to the house, a government residence that Mr. Milosevic occupies despite his ouster. Inside the jeeps, men sat without moving. A police prison van and two ambulances were also parked down the street.
Within half an hour of the call to defend Mr. Milosevic, several hundred supporters, most middle-aged or pensioners, were gathered in front of the high gates at the front and back entrances of the house. Some carried batons and handed around a bottle of liquor to ward off the cold. They wore white stickers on their clothes that read, "Slobo, vrati se," or "Slobo, come back."
Every so often they raised the chant "Slobo! Slobo!" and a few shouted and jostled with journalists. As the night wore on, a younger and tougher-looking group joined the crowd ringing the walls of the compound.
The supporters have been guarding the house in shifts for over a month as Mr. Milosevic's arrest has become more likely with Serbian government investigations into his and associates' dealings.
Twice this week, the police tried to deliver a summons for both Mr. Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic, to submit to questioning, according to a member of the Yugoslav Left, Ms. Markovic's political party. But the guards at the gate refused to accept the summons. 
On Monday the police arrested seven of Mr. Milosevic's allies, in a move expected to produce more evidence against him. He left behind few written records of his 13 years in power, and Serbia's new leaders have struggled to find direct evidence linking him to any crimes.
But the Serbian prime minister, Zoran Djindjic, said the latest detentions were nevertheless an "important step closer" to indicting Mr. Milosevic.
Mr. Korac, the deputy prime minister, said Friday night that Mr. Milosevic would be questioned by an investigative judge today in connection with financial charges. These are likely to include embezzlement of state funds and purchase of a state villa near his official residence in Dedinje at a low price in 1999.
The Serbian government has been investigating Mr. Milosevic and a number of associates for corruption, embezzlement and abuse of power, and has been building a case against him. Investigators say they have gathered evidence on the house deal but investigations into more serious crimes have proceeded slowly.
Branislav Ivkovic, a leader of the pro-Milosevic Socialist Party, went to the federal presidency building, apparently to negotiate with President Vojislav Kostunica or his aides. 
Later, in Parliament, Mr. Ivkovic was the first to announce that an effort was under way to arrest Mr. Milosevic.
Officials in Belgrade said that Mr. Djindjic's government had moved to replace the state security police guard around Mr. Milosevic, and that most had agreed to be replaced.
Mr. Milosevic came to power as the Communist leadership of the country was crumbling. Under his leadership, the country came apart as well as he attempted to put down independence movements in the constituent republics. Yugoslavia lost four wars in nine years: in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and then Kosovo, which was an integral part of Serbia itself.
The war in Bosnia was Europe's worst conflict since World War II; more than 200,000 people died. 
The international indictment charged Mr. Milosevic and other senior officials with crimes including the murder, forced deportation and persecution of Kosovo Albanians.

HEADLINE: The Senate's Moment for Change 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30 

 BODY:
For more than a decade, advocates of overhauling the campaign finance system have been waiting for their moment.
 First, they hoped that the fund-raising scandals involving Charles H. Keating Jr., the Arizona savings and loan executive, would embolden Congress. Then they figured that Ross Perot would goad the political establishment into action. Then they thought that the disclosures about President Bill Clinton offering big donors overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom might be the answer. 
 Now, finally, the moment has come.
With the Senate widely expected on Monday to approve comprehensive legislation to prohibit unrestricted donations from being pumped into the political system, many Democrats and Republicans credited Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who made campaign finance overhaul the centerpiece of his presidential campaign last year, as the catalyst for the legislation that bears his name. (His own interest in change was incited by his entanglement in the Keating Five case.) 
Yet beyond Mr. McCain's crusade, many who have long followed campaign finance machinations in Congress argued that many less obvious factors were at play.
One explanation is that the Senate simply changed. About a half-dozen new Democratic senators made it to Washington after pledging to refashion the campaign finance system.
"What changed, in part, was the makeup of the Senate, 50-50," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader. "Most of the votes, as you have seen, have come from us."
As an example, in a debate last year in the contest for senator from Michigan, Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat, accused the incumbent Republican, Spencer Abraham, of blocking the legislation sponsored by Mr. McCain and Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin.
"If Senator Abraham was not one of five senators holding it up in the Senate," she said then, "we would not be having this conversation. Campaign finance reform is what we need."
Ms. Stabenow, now a senator, favors the bill. (Mr. Abraham is now secretary of energy.)
Another factor is that with the proliferation of unregulated spending, some lawmakers have come around to believe that there should be new restrictions -- or else the system they so relied upon may damage their own re-election prospects.
It marks a sharp shift given that many incumbents for years did not dare tinker with a system that got them elected in the first place. (That does not mean that lawmakers who support the legislation are comfortable with it; many, in fact, are downright frightened.)
"It's an irony that the system spun so out of control that even the incumbents got afraid of it," said David B. Magleby, a political scientist at Brigham Young University who specializes in campaign finance. "These guys feel a lot more threatened because of the ability of their opponents to target soft money and use issue advocacy attacks on them. These folks crave control of their electoral futures."
An important turning point was the announcement in January by Senator Thad Cochran, a conservative Republican from Mississippi, endorsing the McCain-Feingold legislation. In explaining his move, Mr. Cochran complained that outside groups had swamped candidates by pouring resources into states and Congressional districts.
"Candidates are now becoming defenseless against the huge amounts of money that are now being spent in these campaigns," Mr. Cochran said.
Another explanation that Mr. Daschle did not mention was Mr. Daschle himself. For days he moved behind the scenes to buttonhole Democrats who were threatening to bolt, like Senators Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii.
"I used some fairly tough rhetoric with regard to my colleagues when I talked about this being the true test for Democrats, as we had to stick together," Mr. Feingold said. "Well, because of Tom Daschle, we did."
Another factor is the growing sense of equilibrium between the parties. For years, Democrats complained that proposals dreamed up by Republicas were tilted to help Republicans -- and vice versa. This time, there is less of a sense that the legislation would unduly damage one party over the other.
For all the self-congratulations and high expectations in the Senate, there are no assurances that the legislation will survive the House. Still, there are high hopes among the bill's proponents. The Senate last passed sweeping campaign finance legislation in 1993. And at that time, there was no expectation that the measure would make it to the president's desk. It did not.
During the internal maneuvering throughout the debate over an overhaul this year, politicians were just as likely to cite such outside threats to their own campaigns as they were to mention any public groundswell. Polls show that while Americans overwhelmingly favor a change, it is well below fixing the economy or improving schools on their list of priorities. Politicians and strategists still debate whether the issue could be a career-killer for a politician who votes against an overhaul.
"If Americans really wanted campaign finance reform, John McCain would be president," said Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant who opposes the legislation. "This is not a bottom-up cause."
Mike Murphy, a McCain strategist, countered that the senator could take some, but not all, of the credit. "McCain was the spark plug; he created an environment where the cause of reform got legs outside the do-gooder lobbying in Washington," Mr. Murphy said. "But the closer Senate helped, too."
Indeed, even Bush loyalists are mindful that while Mr. McCain lost the Republican nomination, he had drawn enormous attention from his campaign finance drive -- and that on several recent days he dominated the news more than the president.
"Timing is everything," said David L. Boren, the president of the University of Oklahoma who, as a Democratic senator from Oklahoma, was for years the Senate's biggest crusader for a change. "We were rarely on the front page. It was very frustrating. Now, it's on the front page in part because of the McCain presidential campaign."
Fred Wertheimer, who for years has been the lobbyist most closely associated with pressing to change the system, cited a broader explanation than simply Mr. McCain or the new Senate.
"In our country, we tend to deal with big problems when they become a crisis," Mr. Wertheimer said. "This issue has reached the crisis stage."
Maybe so. But crisis or not, there seems to be consensus on one point: the moment has arrived.

The Thrill Of It All

BYLINE:  By Frank Rich 

 BODY:
George W. Bush, earnest student of his father's one-term presidency, finally figured out that it is still the economy, stupid, that could do him in. 
 And so on Tuesday Mr. Bush went to Kalamazoo to give what his aides billed as a "major address" in which he stopped saying that the country was on the skids and instead took a sunny view. "The American economy," the president said, "is like a great athlete at the end of the first leg of a long, long race -- somewhat winded, but fundamentally strong." A day later he upped the ante to irrational exuberance, telling a White House conference of high-tech leaders "the future is incredibly bright." 
 If I may mix sports metaphors, Mr. Bush was sucker-punched. After weeks in which the Democrats had pounded him and Dick Cheney for talking down the economy -- "The result of the administration's rhetoric is an economic slowdown," said Tom Daschle -- the president fell into their trap. It's manifestly clear that whatever is happening with the economy, Mr. Bush has had little to do with it. The stock market tech bubble burst last spring, well before he muttered a discouraging word, and it's hard to see how his and Mr. Cheney's poor-mouthing have hurt the economy since. Good signs (low unemployment and inflation, rebounding consumer confidence) continue to mix with the bad. 
Nor does the president's latent Pollyanna-ism make any difference: The day after his televised Kalamazoo cheerleading, the Nasdaq fell almost 6 percent.
The truth is that no one knows for sure where this contradictory economy is going, and it's equally true that almost nothing Mr. Bush says or does (his tax cut most certainly included) will have much of an effect on it. But at a time of uncertainty and dwindling stock portfolios, everyone's looking for a scapegoat. 
The Democrats want to pin the bad news on Mr. Bush -- even if that bad news first hit while Bill Clinton was in the White House. Mr. Bush keeps trying to pin the tail back on Mr. Clinton -- even though he's wasting his breath. If there's an ongoing recession on Mr. Bush's watch during an election cycle, he will be left holding the political bag, just as his father was, no matter who or what is actually responsible. Already this week's ABC News/Washington Post poll shows that only 50 percent of the country approves of his handling of the economy. (Of course, if there is no recession, he'll be upgraded to a genius.)
But there's one major player in this story who clearly isn't blameless, and that's our 24/7 media. Yes, the national hysteria surrounding both the rise and fall of Nasdaq has been fueled, as many have said, by the fact that it's the first time as many as 50 percent of Americans own stock. But if that's part of the story, it's not the whole story. This is also the first time that a major market run-up and collapse have been grist for a mediathon -- our new non-stop multimedia spectacular in which competing cable news services, often abetted by both Web and print journalism, whip a story into a dramatic pitch that is shaped more by the ratings-and-circulation-boosting imperatives of entertainment than by rational news judgment. Back in that ancient, innocent day of 1987 -- the last time the market tanked -- CNN had no competitors, no one had heard of the Web, and there were no financial TV channels examining every quarter-point fluctuation of the Dow. 
Now we have a great news maw that must be fed whether there is news happening or not -- and outfitted with theatrics and filler to sustain the format. In the case of the stock market, James Surowiecki has argued in The New Yorker, the results may have thrown a monkey wrench into the system. "Minute-by-minute coverage" of Wall Street, he wrote, "distorts the way the market works and helps turn what should be a diverse, independent-thinking crowd of investors into a herd acting upon a single collective thought" -- whether to buy or sell. 
This doesn't mean that the tech-bubble mediathon actually drove the economy or market -- any more than it caused Columbine or the JonBenet murder or the Marc Rich pardon or any other story that's gotten wall-to-wall treatment since such epics took root in the mid-1990's. But the overwrought coverage did have a megaphone effect on the highs and lows alike, and at times bordered on the ludicrous. 
Two weeks ago MSNBC brought back its N.B.A. countdown clock to ratchet up suspense for the Fed's announcement of another predictable half-point rate cut. After the Fed's action failed to produce a rally, Alan Greenspan was himself discounted for dramatic effect, his media image transformed almost overnight from the Obi Wan Kenobi of our economy to its doddering King Lear. 
Our mediathons also require the constant minting of new celebrity bloviators who can fill all that air time with spin. In lieu of the criminal lawyers who played that role during the O. J. Simpson trial and the "former prosecutors" and second-rung law school professors of Monicagate came a parade of Wall Street analysts. The stars of the tech bubble included Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch, who caused a run on Amazon after predicting that the profit-free company would hit $400 a share (it's now around $10), and Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley, who championed priceline.com and drugstore.com, among other picks that have now fallen as much as 96 percent in value. "I did not aspire to be a media celebrity in any way, shape or form," Ms. Meeker told The Guardian this month as her media star crashed with a thud worthy of William Ginsburg's. No doubt she posed for the cover of Fortune and let a reporter record her market pronouncements for a New Yorker profile at gunpoint. 
"If you go back 10 years, basically an analyst's job was to tell the client what the analyst thought, not to act as a guru," says another major analyst (albeit with a better track record), who has resisted the urge to become a media hound. Once analysts started to appear on TV to promote themselves and their wares, they were deified like any other media stars, with the consequence that amateur investors overvalued their utterances. "To me, CNBC is only a financial soap opera," this analyst adds, "and you know how addictive soap operas are. The cycle fed on itself until the bubble burst." 
No one should be amazed that the media construct these shows. Now that so many news organizations are owned by entertainment companies, it's inevitable that, as CBS's Andy Rooney has put it, "Most of the decisions made in television news are not about news, they're about money." And print has hardly been immune from joining the act, especially during the dot-com boom and crash. 
What is amazing is how much tolerance the public has for our new hyperbolic news format. The only time there's been any serious revolt was a month ago, when the weather was covered much like the bull market -- or for that matter, like the exit polls on our last election night. Brandishing scientific models and the usual array of doppler toys, our infotainers, desperate for drama that might keep us watching, predicted a blizzard that became the meteorological equivalent of an Amazon stock forecast -- variously billed as the biggest in 50, 150, even 300 years. (There have been official weather records in America for only 115 years.) When the apocalypse didn't arrive, people got angry -- perhaps because they had been directly affected this time, by flight, school and work cancellations. It's only when press hysteria befalls other people that it is so irresistibly entertaining.
What mediathon will come next? My bet is on mad cow. There is no reported instance of this disease in the U.S., but already you can see the hype starting as the media cast about for a new drama at a time of slow news. Grim video clips from Europe are being recycled at an accelerating pace, and now foot-and-mouth disease (which poses no threat to humans) is being frequently conflated on TV with mad cow. The seizure of some Vermont sheep for testing last weekend received breathless coverage even though it was virtually news-free; the Department of Agriculture had first put out a public alert about this suspect flock nine months ago. 
An internal beef-industry document this week says that "the biggest threat mad cow poses for the United States so far is in the consumer fear instigated by national media reports." But why should that stop anyone? Entertainment rules, and a beef scare, valid or not, could be even more riveting than the mauling of Jeff Bezos by the bears.
