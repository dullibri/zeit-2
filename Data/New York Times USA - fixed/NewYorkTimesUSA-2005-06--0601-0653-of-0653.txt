HEADLINE: Oil Settles Over $60 a Barrel As Iran News Rattles Market 

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
With little relief from oil prices on the horizon, crude oil contracts for next-month delivery settled in New York above $60 a barrel for the first time yesterday, as demand for fuel showed few signs of slowing despite the highest energy costs in more than two decades.
 Light crude oil for delivery in August ended trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $60.54 a barrel, up 70 cents, or more than 1 percent, after touching an intraday high of $60.95. Oil futures prices on the New York market have risen more than 40 percent since the beginning of the year.
Oil prices have broken through a series of psychological levels and trading records in the last year or so, rumbling through $40 a barrel in May 2004, then $50 in October and touching $60 a barrel for the first time last Thursday. 
 The latest price spike followed the victory in Iran's presidential election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, an Islamic conservative, who signaled over the weekend that he might adopt a more nationalistic oil policy. 
 "In all fields, including oil, priority will be given to local investors," Mr. Ahmadinejad said at a news conference in Tehran on Sunday, according to Reuters. The comments, in Persian, were taken by some oil analysts as an indication that Iran might further restrict work by foreign investors.
 With little additional output to expect in the short term from oil producers and as the demand for crude keeps growing, some analysts forecast that prices could reach $70 a barrel.
 ''The market is showing us very clearly that it has no idea where the top is, absolutely none,'' said Deborah White, an economist with Societe Generale in Paris. ''The sticker shock has worn off. If I had to call a top, all I know is that it is below $75.'' 
 Higher oil prices have fed renewed concern that the global economy might suffer from the rising energy costs. 
 But while oil prices are high, the demand for products including gasoline and diesel fuel remains very strong. Some analysts said that in contrast to previous periods of steeply rising oil prices, the rise now is coming at a time when the world economy is expanding and can better absorb the price impact. 
 ''Because oil is a necessity, you need enormous price changes to get modest changes in demand,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. ''But there will come a time when the economy will slow down and the damage of high oil prices will become apparent to everybody.'' 
 For the moment, there seems to be little that the world's largest oil producers can do. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are producing close to their maximum capacities and cannot add much more oil to stem high market prices. 
 OPEC, which produces nearly 40 percent of the world's crude oil, showed its inability to drive down prices two weeks ago when it agreed to a largely symbolic quota increase of 500,000 barrels a day. Saudi Arabia, the only country that retains some idle production capacity, blamed a lack of refineries, especially in the United States.
 But it was news from Iran that worried markets yesterday. The country, OPEC's second-largest producer, has partly reopened its oil industry to foreign investors in recent years in an effort to restore output to levels before the Islamic revolution of 1979. But the remarks by Mr. Ahmadinejad, who has been mayor of Tehran, raised questions on the outlook regarding Iran.
 The oil markets will need all the output they can get to meet ever-growing demand, which is expected to reach more than 86 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter of the year, according to the International Energy Agency.
 Analysts do not expect prices to decline significantly until more oil comes on the market and producers invest in new capacity.
 ''You need more than growth slowing down to bring prices down,'' said Paul Horsnell, director of energy research at Barclays Capital in London. ''You also need production capacity to start increasing. Growth slowing down only means you'll hit the brick wall more slowly. That's not much comfort.''

HEADLINE: Shares Near One-Month Lows as Oil Price Rises Again 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks held near one-month lows as oil prices approached $61 a barrel, raising concern that record fuel costs will crimp economic and profit growth. 
 Gains in energy companies like Chevron kept benchmark indexes from falling farther. Cardinal Health, Nike and International Paper were among the worst performers in the Standard & Poor's 500 index after the companies forecast disappointing results. 
 The S.&P. 500 lost 0.88, or 0.1 percent, to 1,190.69, its lowest since May 25. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 7.06, or 0.1 percent, to 10,290.78, the lowest since May 16. The Nasdaq composite index fell 8.07, or 0.4 percent, to 2,045.20, the lowest close since May 19. 
 Investors were reluctant to bid up shares ahead of the Federal Reserve makes its decision on interest rates on Thursday. 
 All but 2 of 84 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect the central bank to raise its target overnight bank lending rate to 3.25 percent, in what would be the ninth straight quarter-point increase since last June. 
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell yesterday to 3.90 percent, from 3.92 percent and the price, which moves inversely to the yield, rose 5/32, to 10126/32. 
 The stock market ''could work its way lower,'' said David Darst, chief investment officer for Morgan Stanley's individual investor group. Along with expectations of rate increases, ''you've got the high oil prices, you've got some weakness expected to develop the rest of this year in corporate earnings.'' 
 About 10 stocks fell for every 9 that rose on the New York Stock Exchange as 1.36 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 10 percent less than the three-month average. 
 All but 3 of the 29 energy stocks in the S.&P. 500 advanced as crude oil climbed to a record. 
 Chevron, which offered to buy Unocal in April for $16.45 billion, added 56 cents, to $57.25. The China National Offshore Oil Corporation said yesterday that it wanted Washington to conduct a formal national security review of its $18.5 billion bid for Unocal as the Chinese company tries to head off complaints in Congress about its offer. 
 Cardinal Health, a drug distributor, tumbled $4.08, or 6.7 percent, to $56.43 for the steepest drop in the S.&P. 500. The company said fiscal 2006 profit would miss its forecast for at least 12 percent annual growth because of higher spending and lower margins. 
 Nike, the No.1 maker of athletic shoes, lost $3.58, or 4 percent, to $85.77. Sales this quarter are rising at the low end of its forecast of 7 percent to 9 percent growth. Sales last quarter increased 6.7 percent, to $3.72 billion, aided by a decline in the United States dollar. 
 International Paper, dropped $1.02, to $31.43, after it said it would miss analysts's second quarter profit estimates because of falling demand for paper and boxes.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: What Parking Ticket Quota? Police Prefer to Call It an 'Expectation' 

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
The city has added hundreds of agents to issue summonses for parking violations. It counts on them to generate more than $500 million for its budget. And it has definite ''expectations'' for how many tickets they write.
 But lest there be any confusion, the city wants New Yorkers to be sure of one thing: Those parking tickets on their windshields are not a result of a quota system. 
That was the mixed message the Police Department delivered yesterday to skeptical members of the City Council. Some of them accused the department of imposing a stealth tax on New Yorkers through a concerted ticket blitz in recent years. Police officials denied that accusation, and said they did not force ticket writers to meet numeric goals.
 But in careful language, they acknowledged closely tracking the number of tickets issued and using that data to assess the productivity of parking agents. Chopping his way through a semantic thicket, Councilman John C. Liu of Queens, chairman of the Transportation Committee, said the police were, in effect, admitting to an undeclared quota system.
 ''Whether you call it expectation or average or baseline number, without using that 'Q' word, it still results in the same thing,'' Mr. Liu said. ''These agents are out there, under pressure to meet their expectation, their baseline number -- whatever you want to call it. Let's call it what it is.''
 Accusations that the police, using quotas, are blitzing drivers with tickets have been hurled for more than a year, and the issue has put the Bloomberg administration on the defensive at a politically delicate time, in a mayoral election year. 
 At yesterday's hearings before Mr. Liu's committee in City Hall, there were new accounts of hapless New Yorkers getting tickets while removing groceries from a car trunk or dropping off an elderly relative in front of a drugstore. While the city has consistently denied that there is a blitz, some intriguing facts emerged that could give critics new ammunition.
 For example, while the Bloomberg administration has cut thousands of jobs throughout the municipal work force, it added 300 parking agents last year, increasing the total number of ticket writers to 1,100, said John Valles, director of parking enforcement for the Police Department. His division issued more than five million tickets last year for offenses like double-parking, blocking a bus stop or parking in an illegal curbside spot, he said.
 Asked to explain the criteria for evaluating a parking agent's job performance, Mr. Valles at first made no mention of the number of tickets the agent issued. Only after pressed by Mr. Liu did he reveal that commanders ''have an expectation'' for how many summonses an agent should be issuing, based in part on the previous year's numbers, and that if agents fall short they can expect a visit from the boss.
 ''We have a mechanism where we send a supervisor to actually give a one-on-one with that particular agent to see what deficiencies that agent may have,'' he said. Mr. Valles did add that it was sometimes possible for ticket totals to decline because fewer people were parking illegally.
 Sitting beside Mr. Valles at the witness table, Susan Petito, an assistant police commissioner, occasionally jumped in to engage in linguistic wrestling with council members. Declaring that ''performance measures of traffic enforcement agents should not be confused with quotas,'' Ms. Petito said that the department's expectations for the number of tickets written did not mean that parking agents were required to meet them.
 She also took issue with Mr. Liu's suggestion that the department used ticket totals to judge an agent's performance.
 ''We would disagree with the use of the word 'judged,''' she said. ''What we are looking at is an ongoing dynamic evaluation.''
 About the same time that police officials were fielding questions from the Council, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was being asked about the same topic during a press conference in Brooklyn, where he announced an economic development program. He defended the police, saying, ''If you break the law, you are going to get a ticket,'' and then chided the reporter who asked the question.
 ''We're always going to have productivity measures,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''You work under a productivity measure; if you don't write anything, I would suggest, you're going to have a big problem.''

HEADLINE: Bureaucrats And Indians

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

DATELINE: CROW AGENCY, Mont. 

 BODY:
The Crow Indians rode with Custer at Little Bighorn, but they have since reconsidered. On the anniversary of the battle Saturday, they cheered during a re-enactment when Indians drove a stake through his fringed jacket and carved out the heart of the soldier going by the name of Yellow-Hair in Blue Coat Who Kills Babies, Old Men and Old Women.
 Their revised opinion is understandable considering what has happened to them since that battle to get their valley back from rival tribes. Today it's a Crow reservation with enough land and mineral resources to make each tribe member a millionaire, yet nearly a third live below the poverty level, and the unemployment rate has reached 85 percent.
 What went wrong? Before Custer, the Crows had prospered by trading with whites, but he represented a new kind of white: the one who tells you he's from Washington and he's here to help you. As the economists Terry Anderson and Fred McChesney have documented, the downfall of the American Indians correlates neatly with the rise of two federal bureaucracies. 
 The first was the standing army established during the Mexican War of the 1840's. Before then, settlers who wanted Indian land usually had to fight for it themselves or rely on local militias, so they were inclined to look for peaceful solutions. From 1790 to 1840, the number of treaties signed with Indians each decade far exceeded the number of battles with them. 
 But during the next three decades there were more battles than treaties, and after the Army's expansion during the Civil War the number of battles soared while treaties ceased. Settlers became an adept special interest lobbying for Washington to seize Indian land for them. For military leaders, the ''Indian problem'' became a postwar rationale for maintaining a large force; for officers like Custer, battles were essential for promotions and glory.
 Indians no longer had any bargaining power, and they were powerless to resist the troops that avenged Custer's death. They were consigned to reservations and ostensibly given land, but it was administered by another bureaucracy, the agency that would grow into what's now the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
 The agency, in addition to giving some of the best land away to whites, allotted parcels to individual Indians with the goal of gradually transferring all the land and ending federal supervision. But what self-respecting bureaucrats work themselves out of a job? 
 As the land under their control dwindled, they presumed that Indians were not ''competent'' to own land outright. It had to be placed under the agency's own enlightened trusteeship. They kept allotting parcels of this ''trust land'' to individual Indians, but an Indian couldn't sell or lease his parcel without permission from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
 The rules discouraged sales and encouraged parcels of land to be passed on to multiple heirs. Today it's common to find a tract with dozens or hundreds of owners. Instead of inheriting the family ranch, which they could work themselves or use as collateral to start another business, these Indians inherit the right to collect checks from the federal bureaucrats who lease their land to others, usually non-Indians.
 The system leaves Indians with little incentive to work their land or extract the maximum value by improving it. Not surprisingly, Dr. Anderson finds that trust lands are only half as productive as the other parcels of private land on the reservation that were given outright to Indians under the old system. 
 Some Indians are trying to go back to the old system, but it's not easy, as Gus Gardner has discovered. For five years he has been hoping to exchange his trust lands -- tiny portions of more 100 different tracts on the Crow reservation -- for one big piece of land for his own cattle ranch. But he figures the paperwork involved will take at least another three years.
 ''Just give me a regular deed to land that I own and let me go on my own,'' he said. That sounds like a reasonable enough request in a capitalist country, but changing the current system seems politically unrealistic. It has too many defenders at the local and state level whose living depends on it.
 Cutting paperwork means cutting bureaucrats' jobs, a feat that makes killing Yellow-Hair in Blue Coat look easy. No one has yet figured out how to drive a stake through the heart of White-Collar With Red Tape.

HEADLINE: The Not-So-Long Gray Line

BYLINE: By Lucian K. Truscott IV. 
Lucian K. Truscott IV is a novelist and screenwriter.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
JUNE is the month in which West Point celebrates the commissioning of its graduating class and prepares to accept a new group of candidates eager to embrace the arduous strictures of the world's most prestigious military academy. But it can also be a cruel month, because West Pointers five years removed from graduation have fulfilled their obligations and can resign. 
 My class, that of 1969, set a record with more than 50 percent resigning within a few years of completing the service commitment. (My father's class, 1945, the one that ''missed'' World War II, was considered to be the previous record-holder, with about 25 percent resigning before they reached the 20 years of service entitling them to full retirement benefits.) 
 And now, from what I've heard from friends still in the military and during the two years I spent reporting from Iraq and Afghanistan, it seems we may be on the verge of a similar exodus of officers. The annual resignation rate of Army lieutenants and captains rose to 9 percent last year, the highest since before the Sept. 11 attacks. And in May, The Los Angeles Times reported on ''an undercurrent of discontent within the Army's young officer corps that the Pentagon's statistics do not yet capture.'' 
 I'm not surprised. In 1975, I received a foundation grant to write reports on why such a large percentage of my class had resigned. This money would have been better spent studying the emerging appeal of Scientology, because a single word answered the question: Vietnam. 
 Yet my classmates were disillusioned with more than being sent to fight an unpopular war. When we became cadets, we were taught that the academy's honor code was what separated West Point from a mere college. This was a little hard to believe at first, because the code seemed so simple; you pledged that you would not lie, cheat or steal, and that you would not tolerate those who did. We were taught that in combat, lies could kill. 
 But the honor code was not just a way to fight a better war. In the Army, soldiers are given few rights, grave responsibilities, and lots and lots of power. The honor code serves as the Bill of Rights of the Army, protecting soldiers from betraying one another and the rest of us from their terrifying power to destroy. It is all that stands between an army and tyranny.
 However, the honor code broke down before our eyes as staff and faculty jobs at West Point began filling with officers returning from Vietnam. Some had covered their uniforms with bogus medals and made their careers with lies -- inflating body counts, ignoring drug abuse, turning a blind eye to racial discrimination, and worst of all, telling everyone above them in the chain of command that we were winning a war they knew we were losing. The lies became embedded in the curriculum of the academy, and finally in its moral DNA.
 By the time we were seniors, honor court verdicts could be fixed, and there was organized cheating in some units. A few years later, nearly an entire West Point class was implicated in cheating on an engineering exam; the breakdown was complete. 
 The mistake the Army made then is the same mistake it is making now: how can you educate a group of handpicked students at one of the best universities in the world and then treat them as if they are too stupid to know when they have been told a lie?
 I've seen the results firsthand. I have met many lieutenants who have served in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq, practically back to back. While everyone in a combat zone is risking his or her life, these junior officers are the ones leading foot patrols and convoys several times a day. Recruiting enough privates for the endless combat rotations is a problem the Army may gamble its way out of with enough money and a struggling economy. But nothing can compensate for losing the combat-hardened junior officers. 
 In the fall of 2003 I was embedded with the 101st Airborne Division in northern Iraq, and its West Point lieutenants were among the most gung-ho soldiers I have ever encountered, yet most were already talking about getting out of the Army. I talked late into one night with a muscular first lieutenant with a shaved head and a no-nonsense manner who had stacks of Foreign Affairs, The New Yorker and The Atlantic under his bunk. He had served in Bosnia and Afghanistan, and he was disgusted with what he had seen in Iraq by December 2003. 
 ''I feel like politicians have created a difficult situation for us,'' he told me. ''I know I'm going to be coming back here about a year from now. I want to get married. I want to have a life. But I feel like if I get out when my commitment is up, who's going to be coming here in my place? I feel this obligation to see it through, but everybody over here knows we're just targets. Sooner or later, your luck's going to run out.''
 At the time, he was commanding three vehicle convoys a day down a treacherous road to pick up hot food for his troops from the civilian contractors who never left their company's ''dining facility'' about five miles away. He walked daily patrols through the old city of Mosul, a hotbed of insurgent activity that erupted in violence after the 101st left it last year. The Army will need this lieutenant 20 years from now when he could be a colonel, or 30 years from now when he could have four stars on his collar. But I doubt he will be in uniform long enough to make captain. 
 One cold night a week later, I sat on a stack of sandbags 50 feet from the Syrian border with another West Point lieutenant; he, too, was planning to leave the Army. ''I love going out on the border and chasing down the bad guys,'' he told me as he dragged on a cigarette. ''We've got a guy making runs across the border from Syria in a white Toyota pickup who we've been trying to catch for two months; we call him the jackrabbit. 
 ''He gets away from us every time, and I really admire the guy. But when we catch him, there'll be somebody else right behind him. What's the use? Guys are dying, for what?''
 A couple of weeks ago, I got an e-mail message from another West Point lieutenant; he was writing from a laptop in a bunker somewhere in Iraq. ''I'm getting out as soon as I can,'' he wrote. ''Everyone I know plans on getting out, with a few exceptions. What have you got to look forward to? If you come back from a tour of getting the job done in war, it's to a battalion commander who cares more about the shine on your boots and how your trucks are parked in the motor pool than about the fitness of your unit for war.'' 
 There was a time when the Army did not have a problem retaining young leaders -- men like Dwight Eisenhower, George Patton, George Marshall, Omar Bradley and my grandfather, Lucian K. Truscott Jr. Having endured the horrors of World War I trenches, these men did not run headlong out of the Army in the 1920's and 30's when nobody wanted to think of the military, much less pay for it. They had made a pact with each other and with their country, and all sides were going to keep it.
 When members of the West Point class of 1969 and other young officers resigned nearly en masse in the mid-1970's because of Vietnam, Washington had a fix. Way too late, and with no enthusiasm, the politicians pulled out of Vietnam, ended the draft and instituted the ''all volunteer'' military, offering large increases in pay and benefits. Now, however, the Pentagon has run out of fixes; the only choices appear to be going back to the draft or scaling back our military ambitions. 
 The problem the Army created in Vietnam has never really been solved. If you keep faith with soldiers and tell them the truth even when it threatens their beliefs, you run the risk of losing them. But if you peddle cleverly manipulated talking points to people who trust you not to lie, you won't merely lose them, you'll break their hearts.

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:

9 P.M. (ABC) EMPIRE -- Know why Julius Caesar's murderers managed to pull off the crime? Because Caesar's gladiator bodyguard and confidant, Tyrannus, wasn't around that day. The assassins had sent him on a kidnapping-related wild goose chase. Actually, Tyrannus (Jonathan Cake) is fictional, but he and Octavius (Santiago Cabrera, above right, with Mr. Cake), Caesar's nephew and successor, are the central characters in this six-hour mini-series about politics and intrigue in ancient Rome. Vincent Regan is Marc Antony. Emily Blunt plays Camane, a vestal virgin. Filmed in Italy. Parts 1 and 2 of 6.

8 P.M. (BET) BET AWARDS '05 -- Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith are the hosts, and the award categories include hip-hop, R&B, gospel, acting and sports. Live from the Kodak Theater in Hollywood.

10:30 P.M. (Comedy Central) STELLA -- Series premiere. In the 1990's, Michael Ian Black (far left), Michael Showalter (center) and David Wain appeared on ''The State,'' MTV's fantastically bizarre sketch-comedy series. Then they teamed up to do an absurdist stage show (locally, at Fez). Now, in this new sitcom, they play three unemployed roommates who don't do things the normal way. Tonight they do a routine inspired by ''Flashdance'' to get the co-op board's approval. Then they perform open-heart surgery on their landlord, with a butter knife.

10 P.M. (13) BIG ENOUGH -- Jan Krawitz decided to revisit the subjects of ''Little People,'' her 1982 documentary about the lives of people with dwarfism. This new ''P.O.V.'' documentary takes a then-and-now approach to several, hoping to find out whether Mark, for instance, grew up to be as confident and positive as he was at age 11. And whether Karla, 16 in the first film, achieved her goal of marrying another little person.

10 P.M. (HBO) TWIST OF FAITH -- Tony Comes (right), an Ohio firefighter, grew up in a large Roman Catholic family in Toledo. At 14, he was sexually abused by a local priest. Many years later, Mr. Comes and his wife moved into a new house and found that the man was now their neighbor. In this documentary, Mr. Comes decides to file suit and make his ordeal public.

10:30 P.M. (21) CHARACTER STUDIES -- ''Amanda.'' Amanda Wingfield, the domineering mother in Tennessee Williams's classic ''The Glass Menagerie,'' has been played by some astounding actresses, beginning with Laurette Taylor on Broadway in 1945. Several (including Julie Harris, Ruby Dee and Olympia Dukakis) and two actors (Eric Stoltz and Sam Waterston) who have played Tom, the son and Williams's surrogate, join Eli Wallach in this innovative series. There's also a backstage clip of Williams introducing Taylor to his real mother. ANITA GATES

HEADLINE: Making the Brutal F.D.R. Unsentimentally Humane

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
Few people reminisce longingly about the New York waterfront of the 1970's, with its decrepit piers, graffiti-covered warehouses and tetchy drag queens. But you can say this for it: it had a gritty integrity. The typical riverfront developments of today, with their traditional lampposts and quaint park benches, drip with nostalgia for a city that never was. They have all the charm of an open-air suburban mall.
 The master plan for an East River esplanade, which was unveiled last month by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, is a welcome reprieve from that New York cliche. Covering a two-mile stretch of waterfront from Battery Park to East River Park in Lower Manhattan, the project will transform a series of abandoned piers and derelict corners beneath the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive into a vibrant urban panorama without sacrificing the rough edges. 
 But the master plan is more than a blunt criticism of misplaced sentimentality. Even as it celebrates the city's underbelly, it weaves it into the surrounding neighborhoods with remarkable sensitivity. The plan shows how a series of small interventions, when thoughtfully conceived, can have a more meaningful impact on daily life than an unwieldy urban development scheme.
 Although it is still in the earliest stages of design, city officials hope to complete the esplanade within three to five years. (The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has allotted $150 million toward the project, which has a relatively modest projected cost of $200 million.) Aspects of the plan still must be approved by a number of city, state and federal agencies.Commissioned by the city's Department of City Planning and the Economic Development Corporation, the design sprang from a collaboration among architectural generations: Gregg Pasquarelli of SHoP Architects, based here, the Richard Rogers Partnership in London and the landscape architect Ken Smith. Mr. Rogers, the co-designer of the Pompidou Center (1977) in Paris, is best known for creating a high-tech Pop Art aesthetic whose roots lie in the progressive values of the 1960's. Mr. Pasquarelli, 40, who like many in his generation, is warier of Modernism's mission, is less a social rebel than an astute social observer. 
 Both find beauty in the large-scale public works projects that were a prominent feature of the 20th-century American landscape. Originally conceived in the late 1930's by Robert Moses, the city's imperious planner, the F.D.R. Drive -- then called East River Drive -- is usually considered an example of the brutal approach for which Moses later became infamous. It slices callously through the city, cutting a series of East Side neighborhoods off from the waterfront. The area underneath, which still sometimes reeks of rotting fish -- a memory of the former fish markets -- exudes a seedy noir spirit. 
 Mr. Pasquarelli and Mr. Rogers do not moralize about that past. Initially they considered lowering parts of the elevated freeway to ground level, but the cost was prohibitive. Eventually the team decided that the F.D.R.'s aggressive form could be used to imbue the site with energy. To that end, the crude steel I-beams that support the freeway would be clad in contoured metal or concrete panels. Bands of fluorescent light strips, vaguely reminiscent of a Dan Flavin light installation, extend along the freeway's underside, their arrangement echoing the cars flowing by above.
 Such artistic touches would mesh well with an elaborate system of landscaped berms and shelters to be scattered along the two-mile waterfront. Planted with colorful shrubs and wild grasses, the berms rise right out of the pavement's surface. A series of glass pavilions would be scattered underneath the freeway; they may house restaurants, flower shops or some kind of public services.
 Most of these architectural components are place markers; they have yet to be fully designed. Even so the idea is to create a seamless, contemplative environment along the waterfront that embraces both the fine-grained scale of the surrounding communities and the monumental scale of the freeway. In doing so, the architects shrug off the conflict between Modernists and historicists that absurdly still defines so many urban planning debates in New York. 
 That schism dates from the 1960's, when the activist Jane Jacobs challenged Moses' megalomaniacal plans, but it has little relevance today. For architects like Mr. Pasquarelli, the suburban promise embodied in Moses' freeway and park projects represent, for better or worse, a part of our collective memory. Their task, as they see it, is to salvage the corners of unexpected beauty from those childhood landscapes and give them new meaning. It is an approach that is far more relevant to contemporary life than Jacobs's -- and every bit as humane. The outcome in the waterfront master plan is a project that craftily weaves together a remarkable range of scales. To offer relief from the uniformity of the esplanade, for example, the architects have suggested transforming a number of piers into more eco-friendly structures, sprinkled with public gardens. The surface of one of the piers peels up as it projects out toward the water, forming a viewing platform as well as allowing light to flow down to the water's surface.
 Conceived as little oases, the piers relate to a grander, and still incomplete, vision: the plans for the greening of the waterfront across the river in Brooklyn and on Governors Island just to the south. Extending like fingers out into the river, they help weave these disparate vistas into a cohesive whole. 
 That same surgical approach is used to stitch the project into the surrounding communities. An abandoned median strip running down Allen Street from the East Village to the foot of the Manhattan Bridge would be transformed into a narrow park. Set diagonally to the bridge, it is gently sloped, so that it seems to accelerate as it approaches the waterfront, creating a wonderful forced perspective that pulls the neighborhood down toward the esplanade. Other interventions are more sedate: a sequence of reflecting pools along Peck Street are meant to conjure the street's past as a boat slip.
 SHoP and Rogers have yet to sign a contract with the city to complete the final design. In theory, they could be dropped in favor of another architectural firm. But even at this early stage, the esplanade is one of the few current projects to give voice to a young generation of architects intent on redefining our vision of the contemporary Metropolis. 
 Along with the High Line -- which transforms a section of gritty elevated tracks in downtown into a public garden -- it represents a clear and much-needed break from the quaint Jane Jacobs-inspired vision of New York that is threatening to transform Manhattan into a theme park version of itself, a place virtually devoid of urban tension. It proves that there are still some in the city who are culturally daring, even if their numbers at times seem to be dwindling.

HEADLINE: On the New Waterfront, a Place for the Old

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
A certain postindustrial beauty still haunts the blocks along North Brooklyn's waterfront, where a Hopperesque panorama rendered in rust and brick stretches from Williamsburg to Greenpoint. Frozen in time and twisted in shape, some of these streetscapes once abuzz with factories are now better known as generic urban backdrops for cop shows. 
 A rezoning plan approved last month will allow much of this forlorn stretch to be remade by waterfront high-rises. Provisions were made to include a significant portion of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income residents, which allayed the fears of many opposed to wholesale luxury development.
While few would argue that the largely fallow waterfront was being wisely used before, the adjoining inland blocks are another story. They have long been home to scores of small factories that make everything from cabinets and candles to frames and food. As nondescript as they were affordable, their future is in flux as rezoning could allow landlords to opt for the big bucks by turning factories into loft homes. 
 The last thing someone living in a luxury loft wants to hear is the high-pitched shriek of buzz saws or rumble of delivery trucks that are part of the daily rhythms for the area's industrial ancestors. 
 ''The city is all going to be service oriented and there will be no manufacturing left,'' said Bruno Holst, a woodworker whose shop was gentrified out of several Brooklyn neighborhoods until he settled into a Greenpoint factory that is off-limits to developers. ''If you're not a doctor or a lawyer, where are you going to work? We all can't be computer experts. Everybody has a car, but nobody's a mechanic.''
 Mr. Holst is one of nearly 100 tenants inside a former rope factory located in a 19th century brick building at the end of Manhattan Avenue, where the Newtown Creek meets the East River. On the Queens side of the creek, the smokestacks that once marked that part of Long Island City as solidly industrial are being razed to make way for apartments. There is even talk of putting up an Olympic Village on land that was once home to the Fink Bakery and the Pepsi-Cola bottling plant.
 On the Brooklyn side, longtime tenants in Greenpoint say they are facing pressure from landlords intent on cashing in on the area's improving fortunes. But local industry advocates insist the area still has many manufacturers who need to be in the city and not in New Jersey or on Long Island. 
 ''The era of New York as a center of commerce with an active port and a lot of waterfront manufacturing, that's gone,'' said Paul Parkhill, the director of planning and development for the Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center, a nonprofit industrial developer that runs the Manhattan Avenue building. ''But there are a lot of small manufacturers who cater to a market within New York City. Many of them are creative enterprises who need to be close to their market and employ people who live close by.''
 Industry, Mr. Parkhill said, helps define the very nature of urban life.
 ''What makes a city a city?'' he asked. ''It seems to me a mix of uses is integral to urban life. If people are just living and consuming, is that why people live in a city?''
 He estimated that there are more than 250,000 industrial jobs in the city, and they serve as important a role now as they did generations ago when they were the first and only resort for immigrants.
 ''Historically, those jobs were a way to climb into the middle class,'' Mr. Parkhill said. ''They give jobs to people who cannot adapt easily to the service sector or who do not have the language skills for work even at a big-box store like Wal-Mart.''
 It was only a decade ago that warehouse-style stores were seen as the successor to industry in some neighborhoods, though in recent years they have been kept at bay by labor and community groups. City officials have begun to enact an industrial policy that they hope will help retain manufacturers.
 The proposals, which state legislators passed late last week, would include a tax credit for manufacturers who relocate to specific industrial zones around the city that would then be protected from rezoning. 
 ''We need to update and reflect the current industrial pattern in New York,'' said Carl Hum, director of the newly created Mayor's Office of Industrial and Manufacturing Businesses. ''It's not smokestacks or factories where people are manufacturing widgets. Manufacturing is about things you see every day.''
 Bill Schunk makes something seen by thousands, perhaps millions, of people. He owns Frames New York, which builds frames for museums and galleries. He and two other employees cut the wood and assemble the frames before applying a finishing varnish inside a walk-in spraying booth.
 ''The booth is a good place to walk into and scream,'' Mr. Schunk said. ''That alone pays for itself.''
 Screaming was something he was on the verge of in his old location in Downtown Brooklyn, after his landlord of 18 years gave him 30 days to move. The site, he said, is empty, still waiting for the day when the Nets arena will further boost real estate prices.
 Mr. Schunk's business is now inside the Manhattan Avenue factory building. He figures he could have moved to Long Island, but at a cost.
 ''Before noon, I had three people drop things off,'' he said. ''Almost all of my business is in Manhattan, so I would have had to send a truck around. You lose the human touch.''
 On the other side of Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint's past and future continue to vie with one another. On one street, Stanley Gurewitsch is in the early stages of moving Star Candle to a Bronx industrial park. The company his father started in 1938 to make religious candles needed more space, thanks to the success of the younger generation, who, he said, pushed the company into making new products like scented candles.
 ''But there was no space available in the neighborhood,'' he said. ''Everything was being eaten up by developers and the prices were exorbitant.''
 He said he could have saved money had he gone to New Jersey -- but that would have meant giving up on the 200 New Yorkers he employs. The Bronx location, which he obtained with the help of the Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center, allows him to keep most of his 200 employees. 
 Not too far from him, a small mom-and-pop carpentry shop with five employees faces a more uncertain future. After spending 19 years in a rented 5,000-square-foot garage-turned-woodshop, the couple learned the building had been sold out from under them when the new owners showed up to take measurements. 
 ''I saw the plans,'' said the shop's owner, who refused to give his name for fear his clients would panic and cancel orders. ''They want to put two eight-family homes here.''
 His wife still can't figure it out, plans or not.
 ''I grew up on this block, and I've seen places that nobody wanted to take now being turned into million-dollar condos,'' she said, also declining to give her name. ''Two four-room railroad flats combined into a four and four. And people bought it!''
 The locals are being pushed out, she said, all the way to Ridgewood. She and her husband have no idea where they will go. 
 ''This is not going to be middle class,'' she said. ''When I was a little girl you had Polish people and Russian people. When I was a teenager, you had Spanish people. Now it's just a yuppie influx. The only ones who can afford this are the ones in Manhattan.''
 She meant not just the borough across the river, but the avenue around the corner, which after a lifetime was just as far out of her reach.

HEADLINE: China Economy Rising at Pace To Rival U.S.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China, June 26 

 BODY:
A line of Chinese-made cars began rolling onto a ship here Friday, bound for Europe. The cars, made at a gleaming new Honda factory on the outskirts of this sprawling city near Hong Kong, signal the latest move by China to follow Japan and South Korea in building itself into a global competitor in one of the cornerstones of the industrial economy.
 China's debut as an auto exporter, small as it may be for now, foretells a broader challenge to a half-century of American economic and political ascendance. The nation's manufacturing companies are building wealth at a remarkable rate, using some of that money to buy assets abroad. And China has been scouring the world to acquire energy resources, with the bid to buy an American oil company only the latest overture. 
 Indeed, fierce domestic competition and a faster accumulation of financial assets are laying the groundwork for the arc of China's rise to be far greater than Japan's. 
 ''It's going to be like the Arabs in the 70's and the Japanese in the 80's -- we were worried they'd buy everything,'' said William Belchere, the chief Asia economist for Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong. But unlike those previous challenges, which soon faded, ''longer term,'' he added, China will ''be a much bigger force.''
 China's economy has risen rapidly with foreign expertise and investment. The Guangzhou airport here has a terminal designed by an American company, boarding gates supplied by a Danish company, and an air traffic control tower engineered by a company from Singapore.
 The resulting bilateral corporate tango -- in contrast to the confrontations reminiscent of the 1980's and early 1990's when Japanese capital poured into the United States -- means that China has many American corporate comrades, who have a stake in helping generate its growth. 
 China, economists and Asia experts say, does not face some of the inherent limitations that ultimately stymied Japan and led to economic stagnation there over the last 14 years. With its giant population, China is developing a large and diverse economy, creating an almost Darwinian competition for a domestic market that has extremely low-cost companies ready to export inexpensive goods around the globe.
 ''The economy is much more flexible, adaptable than Japan's,'' said Liang Hong, an economist in Hong Kong for Goldman Sachs. ''Being a continental economy is an advantage because it has competition within.''
 To be sure, China is still at an earlier stage of development than was Japan when its economic rise became a national obsession in the United States. In the 1980's and early 1990's, Japanese companies claimed a sizable chunk of the American car market and purchased Rockefeller Center and the Pebble Beach golf course. 
 The bid by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Unocal has raised worries among some politicians in Washington. That $18.5 billion bid comes as America's trade deficit with China is ratcheting ever higher and the dollar is getting support from rising inflows of Chinese capital, which also helps support low interest rates. 
 More disconcerting to others in Washington is China's growing ability to finance any political and military ambitions. China has missiles with nuclear weapons that intelligence experts describe as already able to hit not just Hawaii but probably California. Beijing also remains chilly toward American entreaties to put more pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program.
 In contrast, Japan's military dependence on the United States made it more willing to accept a steep appreciation in the yen in 1985 that hobbled Japanese exporters. So far, China has put off Bush administration demands to let its yuan appreciate.
 But China's economic rise also faces many obstacles. Its banks have huge portfolios of nonperforming loans that have not yet become a crippling problem because of rapid growth, but that could, as in Japan, make a recession someday even harder to combat.
 Banks suffering from fraud and political pressures have frequently made poor decisions on which borrowers should receive loans, so that China requires more investment for each dollar of economic growth than many rivals. Xu Xiaonian, an economist at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, said that China and Japan shared weak traditions of corporate governance, shareholder rights and the rule of law, and this has hurt efficiency. 
 ''Efficiency rules the game and will decide who wins the game, and not how fast a country grows,'' he said.
 China also has a one-party political system that has not changed nearly as quickly as its economy over the last quarter-century, and a population that will soon start to age rapidly because of the ''one child'' policy. The Asian Development Bank forecasts that from 2015 to 2030, China's labor force will drop to 813 million from 842 million, as India's rises. 
 The big question is how smoothly China will make the transition from central planning to capitalism. 
 One of the best places to see the scope of China's challenge to the West, including China's economic strengths and its political weaknesses, is here in Guangzhou, a city of 12.2 million that is often compared to Los Angeles. 
 At the new Honda factory, a tall fence of yellow wire mesh encloses a long section of the assembly line, where white robots poke and crane their long, vulture-like heads into gray, half-completed car bodies to perform 2,100 of the 3,000 welds needed to assemble each car. 
 Workers in white uniforms and gray caps complete the rest of the welds, working as quickly as workers in American factories -- but earning roughly $1.50 an hour in wages and benefits, compared with $55 an hour for General Motors and Ford factories in the United States.
 ''Our export activities are based on the synergy of China's competitive advantage and Honda's global network,'' said Atsuyoshi Hyogo, the chairman of the Honda subsidiary here.
 As G.M. and Ford struggle with high health care costs for unionized work forces with an average age of nearly 50 in the United States, most of the Honda workers here appear to be in their 20's. They are unlikely to go to the doctor very often and when they do, doctors here charge less than $5 for an office visit and administering a few stitches.
 At a long hall in downtown Guangzhou, it quickly becomes apparent why the Honda workers are young and the pay is low. Rows of young men and women sit in plastic chairs watching two huge television screens covered with Chinese characters and numbers. While it resembles an off-track betting parlor in Hong Kong, 100 miles down the Pearl River, this is really the city's main government-run employment center.
 Some of the employers are hiring dozens of workers at a time, but one of the columns on each screen shows a requirement that would be illegal to list in the United States: the age range for acceptable applicants, most often 20 to 35.
 The official average unemployment rate in China's cities is 4.2 percent. But that excludes China's vast army of rural adults with little or no work to do, an army estimated as high as 150 million people. Millions move to the cities each year, an immense migration that slowed increases in Chinese industrial wages until the last year or two, when the Chinese economy has grown so rapidly that employers have begun bidding up workers' wages anyway.
 The plight of these migrants seems to be improving, and as it improves they may become even more attractive job applicants for multinationals looking for workers.
 ''People who came here looking for jobs used to be dirty and wearing bad clothes, but now they are coming in suits and ties,'' said Zhang Jieming, the director of the Guangzhou Bureau of Labor and Social Security.
 One question is how China can retain the political stability it has shown for most of the last three decades while moving toward more democratic processes that the Communist Party has long claimed as its goal. A neighborhood election here on Saturday suggested that the path to political pluralism may be long.
 Gathered in a junior high school classroom were 45 representatives elected by 5,400 neighborhood residents. Only the representatives, not the general public, were allowed to vote for the next level of government, a seven-member council. 
 Liu Yonghong, the director of the council and a Communist Party member, was re-elected, 44 to 1, defeating a nonparty member. Chen Xuangu, the deputy director and also a party member, turned back his opponent, also not a party member, by 40 to 5.
 The winners may not be in a hurry for change.
 ''If we have stability,'' said Li Weijie, the director general of the municipal bureau of civil affairs, ''we can have successful development.''

To the Editor:
 In the 1950's, Sputnik shocked this country into serious financing for scientific training and research. I, for one, chose the long path to a scientific career fairly certain that I would be able to secure a job doing biomedical research and teaching medical and graduate students.
 Now research is hampered by declining financing, governmental restrictions and an anti-scientific climate. 
 Young Americans, foreseeing unemployment after years of study, are naturally choosing other careers. Lab training slots are being filled by Asians who see that our formidable scientific establishment, built over the past half century, can train them, and an increasingly wealthy home country will welcome them back.
 What new Sputnik will reawaken Americans to again place a high priority on supporting scientific education and research to keep this country's scientific enterprise from declining? 
 Maybe an American-trained Chinese researcher will discover and patent a cure for Alzheimer's disease -- in China.

A Wider Role Is Hinted for Sunni Voters
Iraq's most powerful Shiite cleric hinted at a major concession to the Sunni Arab minority by suggesting he would support changes in the voting system that could give Sunnis more seats in Parliament. The Sunni Arab turnout in the first national elections in January was paltry, and writing a constitution without Sunni participation is proving very difficult. PAGE A12

The Physics of Time Travel
Although no one is booking trips yet, there seems to be no law of physics that time travel is impossible. So physicists are theorizing about time machines, solving paradoxes and trying to grasp why, as one puts it, ''Physics gets time wrong, and time is the most familiar thing there is.''

More Shuttle Problems
NASA has not fully complied with three crucial safety recommendations it agreed to meet before returning the shuttle fleet to orbit, an advisory panel concluded. The findings do not necessarily mean another delay in the launching of the Discovery, set for as early as July 13. PAGE A14

'Great Satan' Recedes in Iran
Old symbols of anti-American sentiment in Iran, like the revolver painted on a wall at the former United States Embassy, are receding, as Iranians in many walks of life interviewed in Tehran say they would like to reconcile with the United States. PAGE A10

HEADLINE: The Speech the President Should Give

BYLINE: By John F. Kerry. 
John F. Kerry is a Democratic senator from Massachusetts.

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
TONIGHT President Bush will discuss the situation in Iraq. It's long past time to get it right in Iraq. The Bush administration is courting disaster with its current course -- a course with no realistic strategy for reducing the risks to our soldiers and increasing the odds for success.
 The reality is that the Bush administration's choices have made Iraq into what it wasn't before the war -- a breeding ground for jihadists. Today there are 16,000 to 20,000 jihadists and the number is growing. The administration has put itself -- and, tragically, our troops, who pay the price every day -- in a box of its own making. Getting out of this box won't be easy, but we owe it to our soldiers to make our best effort. 
 Our mission in Iraq is harder because the administration ignored the advice of others, went in largely alone, underestimated the likelihood and power of the insurgency, sent in too few troops to secure the country, destroyed the Iraqi army through de-Baathification, failed to secure ammunition dumps, refused to recognize the urgency of training Iraqi security forces and did no postwar planning. A little humility would go a long way -- coupled with a strategy to succeed.
 So what should the president say tonight? The first thing he should do is tell the truth to the American people. Happy talk about the insurgency being in ''the last throes'' leads to frustrated expectations at home. It also encourages reluctant, sidelined nations that know better to turn their backs on their common interest in keeping Iraq from becoming a failed state.
 The president must also announce immediately that the United States will not have a permanent military presence in Iraq. Erasing suspicions that the occupation is indefinite is critical to eroding support for the insurgency. 
 He should also say that the United States will insist that the Iraqis establish a truly inclusive political process and meet the deadlines for finishing the Constitution and holding elections in December. We're doing our part: our huge military presence stands between the Iraqi people and chaos, and our special forces protect Iraqi leaders. The Iraqis must now do theirs.
 He also needs to put the training of Iraqi troops on a true six-month wartime footing and ensure that the Iraqi government has the budget needed to deploy them. The administration and the Iraqi government must stop using the requirement that troops be trained in-country as an excuse for refusing offers made by Egypt, Jordan, France and Germany to do more. 
 The administration must immediately draw up a detailed plan with clear milestones and deadlines for the transfer of military and police responsibilities to Iraqis after the December elections. The plan should be shared with Congress. The guideposts should take into account political and security needs and objectives and be linked to specific tasks and accomplishments. If Iraqis adopt a constitution and hold elections as planned, support for the insurgency should fall and Iraqi security forces should be able to take on more responsibility. It will also set the stage for American forces to begin to come home.
 Iraq, of course, badly needs a unified national army, but until it has one -- something that our generals now say could take two more years -- it should make use of its tribal, religious and ethnic militias like the Kurdish pesh merga and the Shiite Badr Brigade to provide protection and help with reconstruction. Instead of single-mindedly focusing on training a national army, the administration should prod the Iraqi government to fill the current security gap by integrating these militias into a National Guard-type force that can provide security in their own areas. 
 The administration must work with the Iraqi government to establish a multinational force to help protect its borders. Such a force, if sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council, could attract participation by Iraq's neighbors and countries like India.
 The deployment of capable security forces is critical, but it alone will not end the insurgency, as the administration would have us believe. Hamstrung by its earlier lack of planning and overly optimistic predictions for rebuilding Iraq, the administration has failed to devote equal attention to working with the Iraqi government on the economic and political fronts. Consequently, reconstruction is lagging even in the relatively secure Shiite south and Kurdish north. If Iraqis, particularly Sunnis who fear being disenfranchised, see electricity flowing, jobs being created, roads and sewers being rebuilt and a democratic government being formed, the allure of the insurgency will decrease.
 Iraq's Sunni neighbors, who complain they are left out, could do more to help. Even short-term improvements, like providing electricity and supplying diesel fuel -- an offer that the Saudis have made but have yet to fulfill -- will go a long way. But we need to give these nations a strategic plan for regional security, acknowledging their fears of an Iran-dominated crescent and their concerns about our fitful mediation between Israel and the Palestinians in return for their help in rebuilding Iraq, protecting its borders, and bringing its Sunnis into the political process. 
 The next months are critical to Iraq's future and our security. If Mr. Bush fails to take these steps, we will stumble along, our troops at greater risk, casualties rising, costs rising, the patience of the American people wearing thin, and the specter of quagmire staring us in the face. Our troops deserve better: they deserve leadership equal to their sacrifice.

HEADLINE: Critics Take On Plan to Close Niagara Base

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: AMHERST, N.Y., June 27 

 BODY:
The Pentagon used flawed data, exaggerated potential savings and strayed from guidelines in recommending the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station for closing, state leaders on Monday told a commission that will decide the base's fate.
 ''This is a decision that runs afoul of what BRAC is supposed to do,'' said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton after testifying before four members of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, known as BRAC.
United States Representative Thomas Reynolds, Republican of New York, said that the Air Force had ''fabricated'' $17 million in savings to justify closing the base and that it was just one of several incorrect figures factored into the decision. He said closing the base could cost more than keeping it open. 
 The base's proximity to the United States-Canadian border and its benefits to homeland security -- a factor in base-closing guidelines -- were ignored, commissioners were told. Members of the commission spent the morning touring the base, Niagara County's second-largest employer. The Niagara base was a late addition to the closure list, officials said.
 ''Niagara Falls was one of the last bases put on the list for closure,'' Gov. George E. Pataki told the commissioners. ''It should be one of the first to come off.''
 The Pentagon issued its recommendations for closings in mid-May. BRAC, which has the authority to make changes to the closure list, will forward its version to President Bush in September.
 The Niagara Falls base, with nearly 3,000 full- and part-time employees and a $50 million payroll, generates about $150 million in economic activity in the region, supporters said.
 The Pentagon's plans to consolidate offices of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service also drew fire from New York and Ohio lawmakers. Cleveland stands to lose more than 1,000 jobs, while 290 jobs or more would be lost in Rome, N.Y. 
 Commissioner Lloyd Newton, a retired Air Force general, said decisions would be based on law.
 ''This commission is committed to conducting a clear-eyed reality check that we know will not only shape our military capabilities for decades to come but also have profound effects on our communities and on the people who bring our communities to life,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bush Hears Endorsement From Schroder About Iran

BYLINE: By ANNE E. KORNBLUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27 

 BODY:
After a meeting with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, President Bush said Monday that it was ''unacceptable'' for Iran to continue pursuing a nuclear program and strongly embraced European efforts to negotiate a deal to halt it.
 After an election in Iran that the administration dismissed as a sham, Mr. Bush said Monday that the United States and Europe were sending the country a ''focused, concerted, unified message.'' Iran's new president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, vowed after his victory in the vote on Friday to move forward with the nuclear program even as he continues discussions with Europe about ending it in return for economic benefits. 
 ''A process which would enable Iran to develop a nuclear weapon is unacceptable,'' Mr. Bush said during a joint appearance with the German chancellor in the Oval Office.
 ''I couldn't agree more with this message,'' Mr. Schroder said. ''We are going to continue being tough and firm on all of that. The message must stay very crystal clear, and it is.''
 On behalf of the European Union, negotiators from Britain, Germany and France have taken the lead in discussions with Iran that are set to continue in late July when the Europeans return with an offer of what Iran could expect in exchange for halting its nuclear program.
 In fits and starts, Iran has been in the process of building nuclear fuel-producing facilities that it insists will be used only for peaceful civilian purposes but that American and European leaders say could be easily used for weapons production. The production of an Iranian nuclear powered reactor is well under way; plans to produce highly enriched uranium are less advanced, but more vexing to American and European negotiators because they would bring Iran significantly closer to becoming a nuclear military power.
 Mr. Bush did not disparage the new Iranian leader by name, reserving his judgment for the elections themselves, which were held only after conservative clerics had edited the lists of candidates.
 ''It's never free and fair when a group of people, unelected people, get to decide who's on the ballot,'' Mr. Bush said.
 After the bruising battle over Iraq, both Mr. Schroder and Mr. Bush seemed to welcome the more congenial discussions over Iran, as well as over proposals to add new permanent seats to the 15-member United Nations Security Council. Germany is seeking a spot on the Council, currently made up of five permanent members -- the United States, France, Britain, Russia and China -- and 10 nations that are elected for two-year terms.
 ''We oppose no country's bid for the Security Council,'' Mr. Bush said when asked whether he opposed letting Germany onto the council with veto power. While hardly an endorsement of Germany's membership, the remark was not a flat rejection, either; previously, United States officials have said they would like to see Japan join the group but have not endorsed such a role for Germany.
 Mr. Schroder, who is trailing badly in his re-election bid against Angela Merkel, leader of the Christian Democrats, canceled a portion of the trip that was supposed to take him to California in order to get back to the race.
 Nonetheless, Mr. Schroder did not appear to be using his differences with Mr. Bush to sway public opinion in Germany, the strategy he used successfully in October of 2002, when European opposition to the war in Iraq helped his campaign.
 Asked about the German elections, Mr. Bush declined to speculate about the outcome. 
 ''As we say in Texas, this won't be his first rodeo,'' Mr. Bush said.
 To which Mr. Schroder, testing the powers of his translator, countered: ''There's this wonderful saying from back home in Lower Saxony, where I come from, which says, 'Ducks are fat at the bottom end.'''

HEADLINE: A Man for All Boroughs

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
This advertisement for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is running on the city's major television broadcast stations.

PRODUCER -- Squier Knapp Dunn Communications

THE SCRIPT -- A male announcer says: ''Through a recession and tough times, Mike Bloomberg's five-borough economic plan has created 62,000 jobs, and there's more to come. Time magazine says Bloomberg has 'spurred a wave of economic development, especially in the four boroughs so often ignored.''' Mr. Bloomberg says: ''To build a business, you have to make smart investments. As mayor, that's what I'm doing for New York City: building infrastructure to bring jobs to long-neglected neighborhoods. A borough-by-borough plan that means jobs, that's our future.''

ON THE SCREEN -- The spot opens by showing a man pushing a cart in the middle of a street, and then shuttered stores on a desolate block. As the music gets more upbeat, it shows Mr. Bloomberg talking to a man in a baseball cap, the view out a moving subway train window and, as the screen flashes the words ''62,000 Jobs,'' workers in a factory. Mr. Bloomberg speaks directly to the camera, wearing a leather bomber jacket and no tie, as a TV-style scroll moves across the screen with statements like ''Atlantic Yards development in Brooklyn,'' and ''Nation's largest fish market in the Bronx.''

ACCURACY -- Since Mr. Bloomberg took office in January 2002, the city's economy had actually added roughly 47,000 jobs as of May, according to the most recent data on the Web site of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is not seasonally adjusted. The 62,000 figure seems to be based on a claim on Mr. Bloomberg's campaign Web site saying he has added that many jobs since July 2003. Mr. Bloomberg's admakers are being somewhat selective with the period they are using in this spot. If they had compared the latest, nonseasonally adjusted numbers in May to those of July 2002, for instance, they would have to show a net loss of a couple of thousand jobs. Still, they can accurately point to net job growth and a drop in the unemployment rate under Mr. Bloomberg, who took office during the recession that followed the Sept. 11 attack.

SCORECARD -- This spot aggressively confronts one of Mr. Bloomberg's bigger weaknesses: the perception among many voters that he is Manhattan-centric and does not care about average New Yorkers. It highlights economic development projects outside Manhattan and shows the mayor among factory workers, dressed casually, while telling the camera that he is creating jobs in ''long-neglected neighborhoods.'' With no advertisements from Democrats to counter this one, it seems he can only come out ahead with it. JIM RUTENBERG

HEADLINE: Name Goods In China But Brand X Elsewhere 

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, June 28 

 BODY:
Never heard of brand names like Great Wall, Hisense, Konka, Amoi and Panda? Outside China, few have. That may change someday, but in the meantime, some Chinese companies are taking a shortcut and adopting widely known names to make their presence felt abroad.
 China's leaders have been quietly encouraging Chinese companies for years to set up overseas operations, acquire foreign assets and transform themselves into multinational corporations -- in other words, to make themselves more competitive in a world increasingly dominated by Wal-Mart, Microsoft and Coca-Cola.
Now, it seems, Chinese companies have gotten the message. This year, Lenovo -- the Chinese computer maker -- acquired I.B.M.'s personal computer business. Haier, one of China's biggest companies, made a bid last week for the Maytag Corporation. And in the same week, in the biggest move of all, one of China's state-owned oil giants made a hostile $18.5 billion bid for the Unocal Corporation, one of the world's largest oil companies. 
 Yet many of the companies seem to be acting partly out of desperation, as more foreign brands line the shelves of retailers in China. 
 ''Chinese companies are now facing serious foreign competition at home,'' said Marshall W. Meyers, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ''So they have to do something. They've got to grow to global scale.''
 The fact is, despite restrictions on foreign competition here, few powerful brands have emerged in China over the last two decades. And now that some of those restrictions are being lifted as part of China's ascension into the World Trade Organization, some of China's biggest companies are being forced to adopt global strategies. 
 With its I.B.M. computer purchase, Lenovo, a major Chinese computer maker but virtually unknown outside of China, is suddenly the world's third-largest computer maker after Dell and Hewlett-Packard.
 TCL, another Chinese company, became the world's biggest television set maker last year after it acquired the television set business of Thomson of France, which also owned the old RCA brand.
 And then there was the bid last week by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Unocal, an offer that touched off a Wall Street-style takeover battle with the American oil company Chevron.
 Experts say that whether these deals succeed or not, they are symbolic of China's rapid economic rise, and its global ambitions.
 ''The Chinese government has been preparing the top 100 to 150 companies to go overseas and expand,'' said Jack J.T. Huang, a chairman of the China practice at the law firm of Jones Day. ''The government wants to use this as a testing ground, to see how well the companies stand up to international competition.''
 Dozens of Chinese companies stand in waiting, and are not shy about their global ambitions.
 ''The future goal of the company is to make the name Great Wall known across the world,'' said Liu Rengang, a spokesman for the state-controlled Great Wall Computer Group.
 A spokesman for Ningbo Bird, a big cellphone maker, sounded equally ambitious: ''Our future goal is to become one of the top three cellphone manufacturers in the world.''
 Earlier this month, the Ministry of Commerce issued a report that said that even though China's exports were dominated by consumer products, there were few famous Chinese brands involved in the export trade. Most goods are being shipped abroad with foreign brand labels.
 To rectify the situation, the ministry called on Chinese companies to start exporting their own ''famous brands.'' Every region was ordered to produce its own famous brands.
 ''We need to cultivate a group of independent famous brands that have international influence,'' the report stated. ''Each industry needs to have its own famous brand for export.''
 The memo reads like a Communist Party document from a state planning commission. But the thinking behind the effort seems to be simple: imitate the foreigners.
 Japanese and Korean companies like Toyota, Sony and Samsung made the moves from national to global brands successfully. But it took years.
 Analysts say Chinese companies do not have that luxury because the rapid pace of globalization means that markets are now quickly won and lost.
 ''Chinese companies don't have that much choice but to acquire overseas companies,'' said Joe Chang, a China specialist at McKinsey & Company. ''Very few companies can build organically any more. If they wait 10 to 15 years, they could be dead.''
 By acquiring well-known brand names, experts say, Chinese companies are hoping to get access to global distribution networks, sophisticated research and development and recognizable brand names.
 ''What these companies are looking for is to build up capabilities,'' said Oded Shenkar, a professor of management at Ohio State University and author of ''The Chinese Century.'' ''This is a shortcut. They don't have billions of dollars to invest in the growth. But here in one fell swoop, you're acquiring a venerable brand name.''
 One advantage some Chinese companies have is that they have worked for years as joint venture partners or suppliers for some of the world's biggest corporations, giving the Chinese an eye into the process of making premium-priced products.
 And the amount of manufacturing done in China is astounding. According to C.L.S.A., an investment bank, 80 percent of the world's clocks and watches, 50 percent of its cameras, 30 percent of its microwave ovens, a quarter of its washing machines, and a fifth of the world's refrigerators are now ''Made in China.''
 ''Japanese and Korean companies initially came to the U.S. with a low-end product image,'' said Douglas Beal, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group. ''It took a long time to take Japanese brand names and turn them into high-end products. Sony now commands a premium because it's Sony. But 20 years ago they couldn't do that.''
 The hurdles, however, are steep. The most serious problem facing Chinese companies, analysts say, is a lack of international experience and weak marketing and management structures.
 That, experts say, is precisely why some big Chinese companies are bidding for Western icons like I.B.M., Maytag, RCA and even MG Rover, the English carmaker that has been pursued by at least three Chinese automakers in the last year.
 And this is why after acquiring I.B.M.'s personal computer business this year, Lenovo asked the I.B.M. managers to stay on and run the entire company from New York.
 ''The most valuable asset we have acquired through I.B.M.'s PC business is its world-class management team and their extensive international experience,'' Liu Chuanzhi, the chairman of Lenovo said in an interview last December.
 But can Lenovo run I.B.M.'s PC business? Can Haier, the appliance giant, manage Maytag?
 Analysts are skeptical because, they say, most mergers fail. 
 ''It's very difficult to make overseas acquisitions,'' said Gavin Geminder, a partner at KPMG, the global advisory firm. ''Chinese companies have the same issues, and they probably have less-qualified management teams.''
 Chan Chun, a professor of finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, said Chinese companies had also struggled to manage their finances in a corporate environment.
 ''In terms of managing for shareholder value, they are weak,'' he said. ''They lack international experience and have poor financial controls.''
 But no one expects that to slow China deal making. In fact, largely unnoticed earlier this month was a $1.4 billion bid by China Mobile, one of the giant state-owned telecom companies, for control of a Pakistani telecom company. China Mobile lost out on the deal, but its bid is notable.
 And many of the Chinese companies are sparing no expense to hire Western lawyers and advisers.
 Lenovo used McKinsey and Weil Gotshal & Manges. Haier is teaming up with the Blackstone Group and Bain Capital to acquire Maytag. And Cnooc has hired Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and a team of lobbyists to make its pitch for Unocal.
 The Chinese companies are also backed by state-owned banks, private equity funds and company war chests.
 Cnooc's bid for Unocal, for instance, is backed by a $6 billion loan from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the largest Chinese state-owned bank, and another $7 billion in loans is coming from its parent company at rates considerably below what market financing costs.
 ''There's probably a lot more deals to come,'' said Robert Morse, the chief executive for Citigroup corporate and investment banking in Asia. ''Liquidity is at an all-time high for Chinese companies looking to fund overseas acquisitions.''
 And being the world's low-cost factory floor is no longer the country's singular ambition, analysts say.
 That is perhaps why China Entrepreneur Magazine recently devoted a cover story to the question, ''Should China Buy Wal-Mart?''
 Xiang Bing, the dean of the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, wrote that if Chinese investors could pool their resources, they could acquire a controlling stake in the ultimate global retail brand: Wal-Mart Stores.
 That, he surmised, was one way a country with few global brands but lots of goods could move up the value chain.

PERSON: Shelby Foote

HEADLINE: Shelby Foote, Historian Who Made the Civil War Real for Millions, Dies at 88

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN; Walter Goodman, who died in 2002, contributed reporting and analysis for this article.

 BODY:
Shelby Foote, the historian whose incisive, seasoned commentary -- delivered in a drawl so mellifluous that one critic called it ''molasses over hominy'' -- evoked the Civil War for millions in the 11-hour PBS documentary in 1990, died on Monday at a Memphis hospital He was 88 and lived in Memphis.
 His death was reported by his wife, Gwyn, The Associated Press said.
Mr. Foote's 89 cameo appearances in Ken Burns's series ''The Civil War'' were informed by his own three-volume history of the war, two decades in the making, that blended his practiced novelist's touch with punctilious, but defiantly unfootnoted research.
 His mission was to tell what he considered America's biggest story as a vast, finely detailed, deeply human narrative. He could focus on broad shifts in strategy or on solitary moments of poignancy, like the tearful but still proud Robert E. Lee picking his way through the ranks of his vanquished army to surrender. 
 ''He made the war real for us,'' Mr. Burns said.
 His goal was to emulate the authoritative narrative voice of the 18th-century British historian Edward Gibbon. Mr. Foote's books carried a great plot, and as academic historians increasingly saw themselves as social scientists armed with the tools of quantitative analysis, he turned to Shakespeare for metaphors and to colloquialisms for literary impact.
 ''What sort of document was this anyhow?'' he wrote of the Emancipation Proclamation, before going on to discuss it.
 Facts, Mr. Foote said, are the bare bones from which truth is made. Truth, in his view, embraced sympathy, paradox and irony, and was attained only through true art. ''A fact is not a truth until you love it,'' he said.
 Critics suggested that Mr. Foote played down the economic, intellectual and political causes of the Civil War. Some said that Mr. Foote may have played down slavery so that Southern soldiers would seem worthy heroes in the epic battles he so stirringly chronicled.
 Mr. Foote is survived by his third wife, the former Gwyn Rainer, whom he married in 1956, and two children, Margaret Shelby and Huger Lee.
 Shelby Foote was born on Nov. 17, 1916, in Greenville, Miss., the cultural center of the Mississippi Delta. He was the only child of Shelby Dade Foote, a local businessman, whose roots ran deep in American history, and Lillian Rosenstock Foote. Among the Shelby-Foote direct ancestors was Isaac Shelby, a frontier leader in the Revolution and the first governor of Kentucky. Mr. Foote's great-grandfather, Capt. Hezekiah William Foote, a slave owner, fought for the Confederacy at Shiloh (where, he reported, his saber was bent and his horse's tail was shot off) and later became a judge. Less respectable was his grandfather, Huger Lee Foote, a planter who gambled away what would have been a substantial inheritance.
 Under the influence of William Alexander Percy, a local author and the uncle of young Shelby's best friend, Walker Percy, the boy took to books, discovering abiding favorites from Shakespeare to Dickens. At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he wrote short stories and poems for the campus literary magazine before dropping out in 1937 without taking a degree. But he did find occasion, with Walker Percy, to visit William Faulkner in Oxford, Miss. The pair were cordially received.
 In 1940 Mr. Foote entered the United States Army and served as a battery captain of field artillery in Europe before his Army career ended abruptly in 1944, when he was caught sneaking off to Belfast, Ireland, to see a girlfriend. The Marine Corps recruited him, but the war ended, and in November 1945 he was discharged. He found odd jobs, including a stint as a reporter for The Delta Democrat Times, whose publisher, Hodding Carter, felt he spent too much office time writing fiction. In 1946 he sold his first short story to The Saturday Evening Post, and after rejections and rewrites he sold his first novel, ''Tournament,'' to the Dial Press.
 Drawn from his own family history, the tale of a Delta planter who gambles away the family fortune was greeted, somewhat unoriginally, as a promising first novel. Not all critics felt that the promise was redeemed in the four novels, all set in the South, that followed. A New York Times reviewer wrote that ''Follow Me Down'' (1950), about a Mississippi farmer who murders a teenage girl, showed more virtuosity than depth, but a later reviewer had kind words for ''Love in a Dry Season'' (1951), a gritty Delta tale. ''Shiloh,'' (1952), which became his best known novel, and a hint of his future achievements, offered an affecting account of the famous Civil War battle through the monologues of soldiers in the blue and the gray. And in 1954 came ''Jordan County,'' seven Delta stories set in reverse chronological order, from 1950 to 1797. He wrote all these books in the garage behind his mother's house. His last major novel, ''September, September,'' set in Little Rock, Ark., during the 1957 school-integration turmoil, appeared in 1978.
 In their six-decade friendship, Mr. Foote and Walker Percy exchanged scores of letters about their work. Mr. Foote, who was a few months the junior, played the mentor, but it was Percy who made the more impressive literary mark with his first novel, ''The Moviegoer,'' which won a National Book Award in 1962. Mr. Foote was at his friend's bedside at his death in New Orleans in 1990.
 Mr. Foote's novels were treated respectfully: Southern literary journals carried long analyses, with at least one essayist faulting the literary establishment for its shameful neglect of his achievement, and French critics found resemblances in his experiments with time and points of view between the Foote world of Jordan County and William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County). But it was nonfiction that brought him widespread attention.
 What began as a Random House proposal for a short account of the Civil War as its centennial approached turned into an opus. Writing in an ornate script with an old-style dip pen in his rambling magnolia-shaded house in Memphis, where the Footes had moved in 1953, he produced the 2,934-page, three-volume, 1.5 million-word military history, ''The Civil War: A Narrative.'' At 500 to 600 words a day, with times out to visit battlefields on the anniversaries of the battles, it took him 20 years. The volumes appeared between 1958 and 1974.
 Carrying readers from Fort Sumter to Appomattox, the work was greeted by most reviewers in the spirit of the New York Times Book Review contributor who called it ''a remarkable achievement, prodigiously researched, vigorous, detailed, absorbing.'' Others used words like ''monumental,'' ''comprehensive,'' and ''even-handed.'' In The New York Review of Books, C. Vann Woodward complimented the author on capturing the ''intimacy of combat'' with his ''impressive narrative gifts and dramatic purposes.'' 
 Responding to the observation that it took him five times as long to write the war as its participants took to fight it, Mr. Foote pointed out that ''there were a good many more of them than there was of me.'' Inspired by the works of Tacitus, Thucydides, Gibbon and, more surprising, Marcel Proust, Mr. Foote's own specially prized writer for prose style, psychological insight and the sweep of his vision, he created a history as written by a novelist, with due bows to a line that included Tolstoy, Stendhal and Stephen Crane. 
 In treating North and South evenhandedly and covering the campaigns in both east and west, Mr. Foote accepted the historian's standards of evidence without the baggage of footnotes, for which he was faulted by some academics, who also criticized his sketchy attention to politics, economics and diplomacy. But most were grateful. Louis D. Rubin Jr. summed up in The New Republic: ''It is a model of what military history can be.'' 
 Among the most vivid scenes was the description of Gen. Robert E. Lee's slow ride after his surrender: ''Grief brought a sort of mass relaxation that let Traveller [Lee's horse] proceed, and as he moved through the press of soldiers, bearing the gray commander on his back, they reached out to touch both horse and rider, withers and knees, flanks and thighs, in expression of their affection.''
 The work brought its author three Guggenheim Fellowships, a Ford Foundation grant and considerably more in royalties than any of his novels had earned, and he was admitted to a distinguished company of Civil War historians that included Bruce Catton, Allan Nevins and Douglas Southall Freeman. ''They call you Gibbon and you know that's silly,'' he told an interviewer. ''But if they don't call you Gibbon you get a feeling they're holding back.''
 Still, it remained for television to carry him to fame. In 1985 Ken Burns, planning his television documentary on the war, called on Mr. Foote, who had been recommended by his fellow Southern writer Robert Penn Warren, to be a paid consultant. The choice of an accomplished stylist steeped in Southern lore was made to order, and Mr. Foote readily established himself as the viewers' surrogate. 
 The series, a smash hit for public broadcasting, attracted an audience of 14 million over five nights and turned Mr. Foote into a prime-time star. His fans learned that he was a pipe smoker who loved Mozart and Vermeer and Proust (he said he had read ''Remembrance of Things Past'' from start to finish nine times) and drank bourbon outdoors and scotch indoors. His dog, Booker, an akita, dozed nearby as he wrote. At one point Mr. Foote was getting 20 calls a day from admirers who just wanted to have him over for dinner. He took a page from Ulysses S. Grant who, in reply to the remark ''You must get lots of mail,'' said, ''Not nearly so much as I did when I answered it all.'' Mr. Foote stopped writing back.


CORRECTION-DATE: July 6, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An obituary of the historian Shelby Foote last Wednesday misstated the relationship between William Alexander Percy, an author, and Walker Percy, a boyhood friend of Mr. Foote's who became a well-known novelist. William Percy was a cousin of Walker Percy, not an uncle. The article also misstated the setting of one of Mr. Foote's novels, ''September, September.'' Although the story unfolds during the 1957 school integration turmoil in Little Rock, it is set in Memphis.

HEADLINE: France's New Foreign Minister Says He Has a Lot to Learn

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: PARIS, June 28 

 BODY:
How does a cardiologist and former health minister with no foreign policy experience suddenly transform himself into the foreign minister of France?
 With lots of enthusiasm and a request for forgiveness.
 The minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, welcomed the Anglo-American press to the Quai d'Orsay on Tuesday and disclosed what he knows and does not know about the world. 
 ''I have a very interesting, very passionate profession, where I probably could have made, I believe, two, three times more money a month than being a deputy or a minister,'' he said of his decision to give up medicine. ''But I chose politics because I like politics.''
 Clearly, Mr. Douste-Blazy, 52, who entered political life when he was elected mayor of Lourdes 16 years ago, is learning the new job along the way. He asked journalists for ''a bit of charity'' if his answers were ''not yet precise,'' and told them they had ''many things'' to teach him. Asked about the scandal in Italy in which 13 C.I.A.-led agents have been indicted in connection with the abduction of a militant Muslim cleric, he replied: ''I don't know about that. I don't know about that.'' 
 Turning to a line of aides sitting behind him, he assured his audience, ''I am going to immediately look into that with my staff.''
 Asked about the news du jour that France was chosen Tuesday over Japan as the site for the world's first nuclear fusion plant, he at first confused it with an announcement on Monday about the licensing by the European Union of Galileo, a potential European alternative to the American Global Positioning System.
 ''Yes, yes, yes, Galileo,'' he said, cutting off the reporter in midsentence. Told that the question was about the experimental reactor in Cadarache, near Marseille, he replied: ''But we have also obtained Galileo, you know! Great day!''
 Mr. Douste-Blazy recovered, calling the long-awaited nuclear project important and adding, ''I am happy that France is getting it.''
 He expressed hope that the negotiations between Iran and France, Germany and Britain over Iran's nuclear program would continue. And he said France was ready to hear the ideas of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain for modernizing the European Union budget.
 Mr. Douste-Blazy, who has also served as culture minister, mayor of Toulouse and parliamentary deputy, moved from the Health Ministry to the Foreign Ministry in a cabinet shuffle this month after the humiliating defeat of the European Union constitution by French voters.
 He pledged to continue France's conciliatory campaign with the United States, but he is unlikely to win any friends in the Bush administration with his conviction that a multipolar world with multiple centers of power (one of them being Europe) is a fact of life that must be accepted by the rest of the world.
 He insisted he was ''not at all positioning Europe as anti-American.'' Rather, he said, ''I am positioning Europe as a force of stability, an economic, commercial power with a unique social model that the United States doesn't have, this is true, and as a political force with a foreign and common defense policy.''
 That description of the world, however, infuriates the Bush administration because it seems to envision a rival power to the United States. 
 But then, Mr. Douste-Blazy said the European Union was in its ''worst crisis in 40 years'' after the shelving of the European constitution and the failure of the 25 members to agree on a budget. He gave no indication of how Europe would recover.

HEADLINE: The End Of the Rainbow

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: DUBLIN 

 BODY:
Here's something you probably didn't know: Ireland today is the richest country in the European Union after Luxembourg.
 Yes, the country that for hundreds of years was best known for emigration, tragic poets, famines, civil wars and leprechauns today has a per capita G.D.P. higher than that of Germany, France and Britain. How Ireland went from the sick man of Europe to the rich man in less than a generation is an amazing story. It tells you a lot about Europe today: all the innovation is happening on the periphery by those countries embracing globalization in their own ways -- Ireland, Britain, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe -- while those following the French-German social model are suffering high unemployment and low growth. 
 Ireland's turnaround began in the late 1960's when the government made secondary education free, enabling a lot more working-class kids to get a high school or technical degree. As a result, when Ireland joined the E.U. in 1973, it was able to draw on a much more educated work force. 
 By the mid-1980's, though, Ireland had reaped the initial benefits of E.U. membership -- subsidies to build better infrastructure and a big market to sell into. But it still did not have enough competitive products to sell, because of years of protectionism and fiscal mismanagement. The country was going broke, and most college grads were emigrating. 
 ''We went on a borrowing, spending and taxing spree, and that nearly drove us under,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Mary Harney. ''It was because we nearly went under that we got the courage to change.''
 And change Ireland did. In a quite unusual development, the government, the main trade unions, farmers and industrialists came together and agreed on a program of fiscal austerity, slashing corporate taxes to 12.5 percent, far below the rest of Europe, moderating wages and prices, and aggressively courting foreign investment. In 1996, Ireland made college education basically free, creating an even more educated work force.
 The results have been phenomenal. Today, 9 out of 10 of the world's top pharmaceutical companies have operations here, as do 16 of the top 20 medical device companies and 7 out of the top 10 software designers. Last year, Ireland got more foreign direct investment from America than from China. And overall government tax receipts are way up.
 ''We set up in Ireland in 1990,'' Michael Dell, founder of Dell Computer, explained to me via e-mail. ''What attracted us? [A] well-educated work force -- and good universities close by. [Also,] Ireland has an industrial and tax policy which is consistently very supportive of businesses, independent of which political party is in power. I believe this is because there are enough people who remember the very bad times to de-politicize economic development. [Ireland also has] very good transportation and logistics and a good location -- easy to move products to major markets in Europe quickly.''
 Finally, added Mr. Dell, ''they're competitive, want to succeed, hungry and know how to win. Our factory is in Limerick, but we also have several thousand sales and technical people outside of Dublin. The talent in Ireland has proven to be a wonderful resource for us. Fun fact: We are Ireland's largest exporter.''
 Intel opened its first chip factory in Ireland in 1993. James Jarrett, an Intel vice president, said Intel was attracted by Ireland's large pool of young educated men and women, low corporate taxes and other incentives that saved Intel roughly a billion dollars over 10 years. National health care didn't hurt, either. ''We have 4,700 employees there now in four factories, and we are even doing some high-end chip designing in Shannon with Irish engineers,'' he said.
 In 1990, Ireland's total work force was 1.1 million. This year it will hit two million, with no unemployment and 200,000 foreign workers (including 50,000 Chinese). Others are taking notes. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said: ''I've met the premier of China five times in the last two years.''
 Ireland's advice is very simple: Make high school and college education free; make your corporate taxes low, simple and transparent; actively seek out global companies; open your economy to competition; speak English; keep your fiscal house in order; and build a consensus around the whole package with labor and management -- then hang in there, because there will be bumps in the road -- and you, too, can become one of the richest countries in Europe.
 ''It wasn't a miracle, we didn't find gold,'' said Mary Harney. ''It was the right domestic policies and embracing globalization.''

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
When the design of the Fulton Street Transit Center was unveiled in May 2004, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority called it one of its most architecturally significant undertakings in generations.
 The proposed subway complex, capped by a conical steel-and-glass dome emerging from a boxlike pavilion on the southeast corner of Broadway and Fulton Street, was to be a Grand Central Terminal for Lower Manhattan, unifying five haphazardly linked subway lines and providing an underground connection to the World Trade Center transportation hub being designed by the architect Santiago Calatrava.
''It will be the pre-eminent New York City transit facility of our time, a civic structure of the highest architectural quality,'' the chief architect at New York City Transit, Porie Saikia-Eapen, said at a public forum in January. 
 Now, because of budget considerations, the ambitious design has been scaled back, the authority announced on Monday. The dome, designed to transmit light to the subterranean platforms, is now far less prominent. A proposed link between the Cortlandt Street station on the R and W lines and the World Trade Center terminus on the E has been scuttled. A concourse under Dey Street, connecting the trade center site to the west with the subway depot to the east, will be narrower than initially planned. 
 The changes, if not enormous, still constitute one more setback for the broader post-Sept. 11 vision of downtown rebirth, an effort that has been beset by numerous delays and miscalculations. 
 The authority insists that it will still realize the project's major goals: clearer transfers between the A, C, E, J, M, R, W and Z and Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 lines; a link between those subway lines and the trade center site; better access for disabled riders; and a major street-level entrance to a critical transit hub that is used for 275,000 passenger entries, exits and transfers each day. 
 The most noticeable revision to the original design is in the crystalline dome, with an opening for light at its peak. The dome is now considerably shorter and smaller, although its exact dimensions have not been decided. 
 ''What we tried to do was preserve the goal of capturing daylight and sending it down to the lowest levels of the transit system, and at the same time come up with efficiencies that would allow us to save cost,'' said William M. Wheeler Jr., the authority's planning director.
 The projected budget had grown from $750 million to $825 million. The project is being financed almost exclusively from the $4.5 billion in grants allocated for downtown rebuilding. Even with the design changes, the new projected cost is $785 million, and the authority still has to find money to cover any costs over the original budget.
 The project itself is at least one year behind schedule. Completion of the final design, initially set for last October, has been pushed ahead to next May, although construction on two elements -- new southern entrances to the Nos. 4 and 5 lines at Cortlandt Street and Maiden Lane, and rehabilitation of the Fulton Street station on the Nos. 2 and 3 -- started in January.
 The project is supposed to be built by December 2008. Today, the authority's board is scheduled to approve a $128 million contract with Slattery Skanska, a unit of the Swedish construction firm Skanska, to build the concourse under Dey Street. 
 Some people involved in the project spoke of the new design in positive terms yesterday. 
 ''It will be different,'' said James Carpenter, a designer who is known for his use of light and whose firm is working on the dome. ''But I think it will be equally engaging and activating for the space.'' A principal at the lead architectural firm, Grimshaw, did not respond to a request for comment. 
 The executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, Fredric M. Bell, said he liked the smaller dome. ''If anything, I thought the proportion was better,'' he said. ''The earlier manifestation of the project was totally dominated by the dome.''
 Mr. Wheeler, the authority's planning director, said the decision to eliminate the new passageway between the Cortlandt Street station and the World Trade Center station was a difficult one. The project's aim had been to connect as many of the subway lines in the area as possible. But, with pressing concerns about money, the authority determined that riders would be able to use the new PATH station designed by Mr. Calatrava to make the connection between the two subway lines with no great difficulty.

HEADLINE: France Will Get Fusion Reactor To Seek a Future Energy Source

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH; Kenneth Chang contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: PARIS, June 28 

 BODY:
An international consortium announced Tuesday that France would be the site of the world's first large-scale, sustainable nuclear fusion reactor, an estimated $10 billion project that many scientists see as crucial to solving the world's future energy needs.
 ''It is a great success for France, for Europe and for all the partners in ITER,'' President Jacques Chirac said in a statement released after the six-member consortium of the United States, Russia, China, Japan, South Korea and the European Union chose the country as the site for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor.
 Japan, which had lobbied hard for the project, dropped out of the bidding in the last few days and ceded to France. The consortium agreed in Moscow to build the project at Cadarache in southern France.
 Nuclear fusion is the process by which atomic nuclei are forced together, releasing huge amounts of energy, as with the sun or a hydrogen bomb. The process has long been studied as a potential energy source that would be far cleaner than burning fossil fuels or even nuclear fission, which is used in nuclear reactors today but produces dangerous radioactive waste. 
 While the physics of nuclear fusion have long been understood, the engineering required to control the process remains difficult.
 The logistics of coordinating construction in a six-member consortium has presented an even bigger challenge. The project was started in 1988 but bogged down in bickering over where the reactor's design team would be based. A compromise split the team between Japan, Germany and the United States, but the consortium struggled over where the reactor would be built.
 Canada, Spain, France and Japan were originally in contention for the reactor site, but a December 2003 ministerial meeting to pick a winner ended in a deadlock, with the United States, Japan and South Korea backing the Japanese site and the other three consortium members pushing for the site in France.
 Recently, Japan agreed to relinquish its bid in return for the consortium's commitment to build a $1 billion materials testing center there. 
 The consortium also promised that any subsequent fusion reactor built by the consortium would be built in Japan. It is a significant concession, because the first reactor is only a demonstration plant meant to prove that fusion can be harnessed as an economically viable energy source. A second reactor would probably be a prototype meant for commercial power generation.
 With the agreement, the consortium can now proceed with the drafting of a deal on the construction and operation of the reactor. ITER officials said they hoped that the accord would be signed by the end of the year, allowing work on the reactor to begin next year and ground to be broken at the Cadarache site in 2008. Current plans foresee the reactor operating in 2016.
 Construction of the reactor is estimated to cost $5 billion, with its operation costing another estimated $5 billion over 20 years, according to ITER. The host country is expected to cover half of those costs, with the other five partners each paying 10 percent. Those numbers are based on current dollars, however, meaning the actual cost of the reactor will be much higher by the time it is completed.
 Many experts also predict that construction could take much longer than now foreseen given the difficulty of coordinating multiple suppliers of costly and highly technical components in many countries. The agreement leaves open the possibility that still more countries may take part in the project. India, for example, has expressed interest. 
 The final agreement is expected to include provisions that would require consortium members that cause delays to pay compensation.
 The fusion project has stirred controversy since it was first proposed in the 1980's, with many scientists arguing that such ''big science'' will rob financing from the ''little science'' of individual researchers who have often produced the world's most striking scientific breakthroughs.
 But criticism has been drowned out by the growing recognition of fusion's potential as a solution to the world's looming energy crisis.
 ''We all know oil and gas depletion will start in 2030 or 2035,'' said Peter Haug, secretary general of the European Nuclear Society.
 He said most experts agreed that because of technical difficulties, renewable energy sources like wind or solar power would never provide more than 15 or 20 percent of the world's energy needs. There is enough coal in the earth to keep the world running for centuries, but at an unacceptable environmental cost. As oil and gas fields peter out, Mr. Haug and others say, the world will be forced to turn to nuclear energy. 
 ''We don't think fusion will remove fission from the production scheme,'' Mr. Haug said. ''But it will probably be used along with fission because of the growing energy needs of man.''
 Still, few scientists expect a fusion reactor to generate commercially viable electricity before mid-century, if by then.
 In principle, using fusion to produce energy is easy: take hydrogen atoms and press them together to form helium. The helium is a bit lighter than its constituent hydrogen pieces, and by Einstein's E=mc2 equation, that tiny change in mass results in a large release of energy.
 At the center of the sun, where temperatures reach nearly 30 million degrees Fahrenheit and hydrogen atoms are pushed together at ultra-high pressures, fusion generates light and heat. But turning fusion into a viable source of energy requires figuring out how to recreate on Earth the conditions at the sun's heart. 
 Instead of ordinary hydrogen, fusion reactors use heavier versions, known as deuterium and tritium, that fuse together more easily. Experimental fusion reactors have been able to heat gases to temperatures of hundreds of millions of degrees. The harder task, however, is confining the hot gas. 
 ITER follows the same approach used by most large-scale fusion experiments since the 1970's, using doughnut-shaped magnetic fields to confine the gas, but it will be the first large enough to explore how well fusion reactions can be sustained. 
 In order to succeed, the ITER project must demonstrate that it can create a fuel cycle in the reactor that will produce excess tritium, the reactor's fuel, from a ''blanket'' of lithium lining the reactor chamber. As neutrons thrown off from the fusion reaction strike lithium atoms, they produce tritium. But in order for the reactor to be viable, consortium officials say, the reactor must produce more tritium than it consumes.
 Even fusion proponents concede that the process is decades away from practical use. A timeline published on ITER's Web site foresees a larger demonstration project that would begin operating around 2030. A commercial fusion reactor would follow around 2050.
 ITER's interim leader, Yasuo Shimomura, said the project's next step would be to appoint a director general who could start the complicated procurement process.
 The consortium has already spent $700 million on scale models of the reactor's major components, and ''in this sense, there is no fundamental technical problem,'' Dr. Shimomura said in a phone call from ITER's offices in Garching, Germany. ''But the machine is very complicated, and the procurement will be done between six parties, and this is not a small experimental device, it is a real nuclear device, so quality control will be very important.''
 In the meantime, the fusion project means money for the industries and scientific sectors contributing to it. Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin of France said it would create 4,000 jobs and bolster research and development there. 
 ''It's brings us great joy and great pride,'' said Pascale Amenc Antoni, director of the French Atomic Energy Commission's Cadarache Center, where the reactor will be built. She said it also recognized the work the center has already carried out at its nuclear fusion research facility.

Arlie Hochschild is a professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, and the co-editor of ''Global Woman: Nannies, Maids and Sex Workers in the New Economy.''

DATELINE: BERKELEY, CALIF. 

 BODY:
LAST month John Miller, director of the State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, said that half the victims of human trafficking may be children under 18. Children are ''at the center'' of the problem of trafficking, which, Mr. Miller noted, is one of the great human rights issues of the 21st century. Yes, children should be at the heart of our concern for human rights. But that concern should start with the children detained in American prisons in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. 
 Under international law, the line between childhood and maturity is 18. In communications with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, the Pentagon has lowered the cutoff to 16. For this reason among others, we don't know exactly how many Iraqi children are in American custody. But before the transfer of sovereignty from the Coalition Provisional Authority to an Iraqi interim government a year ago, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported registering 107 detainees under 18 during visits to six prisons controlled by coalition troops. Some detainees were as young as 8. 
 Since that time, Human Rights Watch reports that the number has risen. The figures from Afghanistan are still more alarming: the journalist Seymour Hersh wrote last month in the British newspaper The Guardian that a memo addressed to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld shortly after the 2001 invasion reported ''800-900 Pakistani boys 13-15 years of age in custody.'' 
 Juvenile detainees in American facilities like Abu Ghraib and Bagram Air Base have been subject to the same mistreatment as adults. The International Red Cross, Amnesty International and the Pentagon itself have gathered substantial testimony of torture of children, bolstered by accounts from soldiers who witnessed or participated in the abuse.
 According to Amnesty International, 13-year-old Mohammed Ismail Agha was arrested in Afghanistan in late 2002 and detained without charge or trial for over a year, first at Bagram and then at Guantanamo Bay. He was held in solitary confinement and subjected to sleep deprivation. ''Whenever I started to fall asleep, they would kick at my door and yell at me to wake up,'' he told an Amnesty researcher. ''They made me stand partway, with my knees bent, for one or two hours.'' 
 A Canadian, Omar Khadr, was 15 in 2002 when he was captured in Afghanistan and interned at Guantanamo. For 2 1/2 years, he was allowed no contact with a lawyer or with his family. Seventeen-year-old Akhtar Mohammed told Amnesty that he was kept in solitary confinement in a shipping container for eight days in Afghanistan in January 2002.
 A Pentagon investigation last year by Maj. Gen. George Fay reported that in January 2004, a leashed but unmuzzled military guard dog was allowed into a cell holding two children. The intention was for the dog to '''go nuts on the kids,' barking and scaring them.'' The children were screaming and the smaller one tried to hide behind the larger, the report said, as a soldier allowed the dog to get within about one foot of them. A girl named Juda Hafez Ahmad told Amnesty International that when she was held in Abu Ghraib she ''saw one of the guards allow his dog to bite a 14-year-old boy on the leg.''
 Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, formerly in charge of Abu Ghraib, told Maj. General Fay about visiting a weeping 11-year-old detainee in the prison's notorious Cellblock 1B, which housed prisoners designated high risk. ''He told me he was almost 12,'' General Karpinski recalled, and that ''he really wanted to see his mother, could he please call his mother.'' 
 Children like this 11 year old held at Abu Ghraib have been denied the right to see their parents, a lawyer, or anyone else. They were not told why they were detained, let alone for how long. A Pentagon spokesman told Mr. Hersh that juveniles received some special care, but added, ''Age is not a determining factor in detention.'' The United States has found, the spokesman said, that ''age does not necessarily diminish threat potential.'' 
 It's true that some of these children may have picked up a stone or a gun. But coalition intelligence officers told the Red Cross that 70 percent to 90 percent of detainees in Iraq are eventually found innocent and released. Many innocent children are swept up with their parents in chaotic nighttime dragnets based on tips from unreliable informants. ''We know of children under 15,'' Clarisa Bencomo of Human Rights Watch told me, '' held for over a year at Guantanamo Bay, whom the government later said were not security risks.'' Even if a child is found guilty, he or she should be treated humanely, rather than tortured or ''rendered,'' as the C.I.A. puts it, to third parties that torture.
 AMBASSADOR MILLER is right. Children matter. To really place them ''at the center'' of our human rights concerns, the United States should hasten to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child, from which only we and Somalia abstain. And if the Pentagon must detain children, it should do so in separate facilities, with access to family, and under humane conditions that include the offer of rehabilitation and education. 
 Finally, the Pentagon should open all prisons to human rights inspectors. By taking these steps, the United States could begin to reverse some of the terrible harm that continues to be done to children in our name.

HEADLINE: House Bill Toughens Rules On Marketing to Military

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
The House of Representatives voted yesterday to approve a measure that would tighten rules that govern the marketing of life insurance, high-cost loans and other financial products to American military personnel.
 Both the Defense Department and state insurance regulators have been making progress in their efforts to protect service members, especially young recruits and junior officers, from deceptive sales pitches for insurance and investments.
The House bill, which passed 405 to 2, would abolish an archaic form of mutual fund, known as contractual plans, sold almost exclusively to military personnel. The sales charges on contractual plans consume half of an investor's first-year contributions, substantially reducing the funds' long-term performance. 
 The measure would also give state insurance regulators clear jurisdiction over insurance sales on military bases within their borders. And it would require the Defense Department to establish a central registry for tracking insurance agents who violate military sales rules and to report the agents to the state licensing authorities.
 Representative Geoff Davis, a Republican of Kentucky and the lead sponsor of the current bill, told House members on Monday that he had personally been persuaded to buy some expensive mutual funds and insurance policies when he was a young Army officer.
 ''I didn't make the decision because I was a financial expert, because I wasn't,'' he said. ''I made the decision because a retired service member working as a salesman presented this, and he was using referrals from other service members.''
 The bill would also take aim at high-cost lenders who offer military personnel quick, short-term ''payday'' loans with annual interest rates that can approach 1,000 percent. Specifically, a provision drafted by Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat, would prevent payday lenders from threatening to contact a military borrower's commanding officer or using symbols or language that suggest the Department of Defense or any federal entity endorses the lender.
 An earlier version of the bill, without the payday lending protections, cleared the House last October but died when the Senate failed to act before the 2004 legislative session ended.
 Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican and the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has said he will take up the military insurance issue later this year after the completion of a Government Accountability Office study and a report by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Meanwhile, John W. Oxendine, the insurance commissioner in Georgia, has confirmed that regulators from more than a dozen states are participating in his examination of companies that sell life insurance on military bases. 
 The states involved in the effort, which was confirmed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, include California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia.
 One company under examination, Madison National Life Insurance, based in Middleton, Wis., recently became the second military insurer to offer full cash refunds to service members. More than 1,100 soldiers who bought its policies at Fort Benning and Fort Gordon are eligible for refunds, Mr. Oxendine said. A second company, American Amicable Life Insurance of Waco, Tex., has already offered refunds to about 900 military customers under an agreement reached with Mr. Oxendine's office last fall.
 The Defense Department's own efforts to address life insurance sales on military bases are ready to move forward, officials there said. In April, the Pentagon unveiled a set of proposed rules and invited public and industry comments on them.
 That comment period ended last week, clearing the way for the rules to be officially adopted; however, earlier legislative restrictions prevent the rules from becoming effective until 90 days after the G.A.O. report is delivered to Congress, officials said.
 The rules incorporate some crucial proposals in the legislation just approved by the House, but do not address either contractual plans or collection practices on payday loans.

HEADLINE: Nassau Parks Deputy Resigns Amid Inquiry Into Aide's Pay

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., June 28 

 BODY:
The deputy Nassau County executive in charge of parks has resigned under fire as a grand jury investigates complaints of payroll irregularities involving a politically connected assistant.
 The case, raising doubts that the assistant actually worked the hours he billed the county for, has quickly turned into an issue in this year's campaign for county executive.
 The deputy, Michael Klein, quit in a letter dated Monday, saying he had been ''betrayed'' by the assistant, Shomwa Shamapande, who once worked for Bill Lynch, a former deputy mayor of New York, and for Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, both Democrats. 
 Mr. Klein said Mr. Shamapande, whom the county paid about $65,000 last year, ''apparently has been submitting time sheets for work that he did not perform.''
 On Tuesday, County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi praised Mr. Klein for improving Nassau's parks but accepted his resignation, saying there were ''no excuses'' for failing to supervise Mr. Shamapande.
 Mr. Suozzi, a Democrat, is running as a reformer, saying he has ended much of the waste and corruption of the Republican administration that preceded him.
 But Republican critics say the payroll issue echoes a Suozzi administration scandal that forced Peter T. Sylver to resign as deputy county executive for economic development two years ago. After investigators found numerous improprieties in the county agencies that Mr. Sylver supervised, he pleaded guilty to billing the county for personal expenses and harassing an employee. 
 ''This is turning into an ethically challenged administration,'' said the Republican candidate for county executive, Gregory P. Peterson. 
 The County Legislature's Republican leader, Peter J. Schmitt, who has been investigating the parks payroll, said, ''This resignation comes after I called for Deputy County Executive Klein's firing, amidst serious allegations of payroll fraud and abuse.'' Mr. Shamapande was fired last week, hours after Newsday raised questions about the parks payroll.
 Arda Nazerian, a spokeswoman for Mr. Suozzi, said his administration had discovered the irregularities and had referred them to the district attorney's office, which confirmed that it was investigating parks operations but did not elaborate. 
 Mr. Klein, who has worked for the New York City parks, hired two former associates there, Mr. Shamapande and Charles McKinney, as seasonal clerks in Nassau, county officials say. They did administrative work, at $25 an hour for Mr. Shamapande and $65 for Mr. McKinney, a rate reflecting his expertise as a parks planner, Nassau officials say. 
 But Edward Ward, an assistant to the Republicans in the County Legislature, said the records showed that Mr. Shamapande routinely billed about 110 hours every two weeks, when the normal full-time schedule is about 66 hours. ''He claimed he worked from 7 in the morning into the night, including 9 o'clock Christmas Eve and 9 o'clock on New Year's Eve,'' Mr. Ward said, adding that Mr. Klein was supposed to approve the time sheets.
 Both aides should have been hired as regular employees or contractors, Mr. Ward said. County officials said they had used the seasonal clerk category, which usually pays about $12 an hour, because the men were hired for temporary projects.
 Though Nassau generally requires county workers to live in the county, Mr. Ward said the rule was ignored for Mr. Klein, Mr. Shamapande and Mr. McKinney. ''We know all three live in New York City and are tied to the Manhattan Democratic organization,'' working together on various campaigns, Mr. Ward said. He charged that their real purpose was to advance Mr. Suozzi's ambitions to be governor.
 Ms. Nazerian said they were hired because of their qualifications.

HEADLINE: Bank One Is Sued by Illinois Investors Over Two Tax Shelters

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
A lawsuit filed this month by three Illinois investors accuses Bank One of creating and marketing two questionable tax shelters that used tax-exempt personal trusts to let wealthy investors hide hundreds of millions of dollars in income.
 Investors have filed dozens of civil lawsuits in recent years against accounting, law and financial firms over shelters, but the Illinois complaint appears to be the first to accuse Bank One, which was acquired by J.P. Morgan Chase last year, of designing and promoting invalid tax-avoidance schemes. 
The lawsuit, filed on June 13 in the Federal District Court in Chicago, describes two new types of tax shelters, called Homer and Bart, after the characters in ''The Simpsons'' television show. Homer and Bart are nearly identical to a shelter called Cobra, according to the complaint. The Internal Revenue Service banned Cobra in August 2000, never considering the shelter valid. 
 The three investors -- Donald R. Wilson, a businessman, and his wife, Laurie Wilson, and Kenneth S. Brody, a business partner -- have sued Bank One and three of its employees as well as the law firm of White & Case, based in New York; Deutsche Bank; American Express; and the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, which is now defunct. 
 The three plaintiffs say they bought Homer shelters in November 2001, believing that they were legitimate tax-saving strategies. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Joe R. Whatley of Birmingham, Ala., said the Wilsons' shelter improperly generated more than $100 million in losses that the husband and wife then used to offset legitimate income, while Mr. Brody's shelter improperly generated bogus losses to shield more than $40 million in legitimate income. The losses were later disallowed by the I.R.S. 
 The lawsuit contends that fraud and malpractice occurred and it seeks unspecified punitive damages as well as fees and costs.
 A spokesman for White & Case, Roger Cohen, said the lawsuit was without merit. A spokesman for J.P. Morgan Chase declined to comment. Spokeswomen for American Express and Deutsche Bank declined to comment, too. A lawyer for Arthur Andersen did not return calls requesting comment. 
 The lawsuit comes as the I.R.S., the Justice Department and federal prosecutors have been investigating abusive tax shelters. The investigation has focused on the accounting firm KPMG, but includes other firms as well. 
 Two Bank One employees named as defendants in the lawsuit are former partners in KPMG's national tax practice, according to the complaint. Homer, for ''hedge option monetization of economic remainder,'' uses artificially generated losses to offset legitimate gains, and channels the losses through tax-exempt personal trusts set up for that purpose. Bart, for ''basis adjusted remainder trust,'' was a precursor to Homer, and operated in a similar fashion.
 The losses for Homer and Bart were generated by trading options on German government bonds, with the transactions engineered to generate losses. Tax shelters that exist solely to produce losses and thus have no economic benefit are invalid in the eyes of the I.R.S.
 The Wilsons paid nearly $3.3 million in fees to all parties and to Deutsche Bank for their Homer shelter, while Mr. Brody paid more than $1 million, according to the complaint. Ultimately, the defendants sold only one Bart to an investor but about 40 Homers, the complaint says. The defendants, the complaint says, ''knowingly acted in concert to market and implement the fraudulent and illegal tax shelter strategies.''
 Twice, in 2001 and 2002, another law firm, Jenkens & Gilchrist, which is based in Dallas, provided written opinions to the plaintiffs saying that the I.R.S. ban of Cobra did not affect the legitimacy of their Homer transactions. 
 The complaint also contends that Bank One did not disclose to the plaintiffs that it had worked with Jenkens & Gilchrist, which the defendants thought was providing an independent legal opinion of the shelter, to develop and market Homer. 
 Homer was created in early 2001, after Cobra was banned, when the two Bank One employees approached a Jenkens & Gilchrist tax lawyer, Paul Daugerdas, at an estate-planning conference at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach.
 Although the complaint contends that Mr. Daugerdas played a major role in developing Homer, it does not name the law firm or Mr. Daugerdas as defendants.
 According to the complaint, one of the Bank One employees developed the Bart shelter and proposed that Jenkens & Gilchrist, through Mr. Daugerdas, provide letters to investors blessing the shelter. 
 Last year, Jenkens & Gilchrist announced a settlement with investors in questionable tax shelters for which it provided legal endorsements. Mr. Daugerdas, who is still a member of his firm's Chicago office, is named in a number of civil complaints against Jenkens & Gilchrist. 
 Deutsche Bank provided loans for and carried out financial transactions used to generate bogus losses in the shelters, and Jenkens & Gilchrist provided approving legal opinions for the shelters, all while knowing they were invalid, the complaint says. 
 White & Case's role was in working with Deutsche Bank, which it had as a client, to design Homer, according to the complaint. American Express, through its American Express tax and business unit, prepared the 2001 income tax returns for the Wilsons, while Arthur Andersen prepared the 2001 return for Mr. Brody. Both firms improperly approved of the use of the questionable shelters, the complaint says.

HEADLINE: Ending the College Loan Giveaway

 BODY:
Forty-two members of the Republican rank and file in the House sent a powerful message to their leaders last week when they joined with Democrats and voted to close an outrageous loophole that allows lenders to skim billions of dollars from loans that should be going to needy college students. 
 At issue is a special category of student loans for which the government guarantees lenders a gargantuan return of 9.5 percent, even though the prevailing rate charged to students is lower than 3.5 percent. 
The loans, backed by tax-exempt bonds, were created in the 1980's, when interest rates were high, to keep lenders in the college loan business. Congress tried to phase out the high-interest loans in 1993, when rates declined and federal subsidies were no longer needed. But the lenders have contrived a series of bookkeeping tricks that have kept the system going, despite damning reports by the Government Accountability Office, the Congressional Budget Office and outside advocacy groups. More recently, the House Republican leadership has seemed determined to keep the gravy train running for the banking industry.
 The amendment, sponsored by Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, is likely to be tied up in a rules dispute. But the Republicans who broke ranks to support the bill put leaders on notice, and set the stage for a very public battle over the issue that should begin after the July recess. The leadership should read the writing on the wall.

HEADLINE: Aid to Africa

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 May I be so bold as to suggest a fifth item to ''Four Easy Pieces,'' by Jeffrey D. Sachs (Op-Ed, June 25), about how the United States can help Africa.
 Current donor approaches to agricultural development in Africa emphasize the investment climate, marketing infrastructure and business development services, focusing on commercial enterprises and irrigated lands. 
 As a result, only scant attention is given to dry lands, small-holder farming of millet and sorghum, or environmentally fragile places like the Sahel region, one of the poorest places on earth. 
 This is unfortunate given that 90 percent of Africa's population is dependent in one way or another on dry-land agriculture, given the important role of food production in any economic growth strategy, and given the significant linkage between poverty and the environment. 
 An approach to agricultural development that focused on vulnerable people in vulnerable places could be another important piece in Mr. Sachs's vision for Africa.

HEADLINE: Drilling for Natural Gas

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Searching for political implications of energy development provides drama but does not address the nation's urgent need for natural gas. ''Drilling in West Pits Republican Policy Against Republican Base'' (news article, June 22) did not mention the vital role that clean-burning natural gas plays in our economy and in our daily lives.
 Natural gas heats our homes, generates electricity and is used to make products as diverse as clothing, computers and medicine. The real story is how to meet rapidly growing demand if we continue to resist developing new domestic supplies, needed to make this efficient fuel affordable for consumers, manufacturers and farmers.
 America's energy producers have been part of the West for more than 100 years. They contribute to communities and are committed to responsible energy development. In New Mexico, producers working with landowners, ranchers and state agencies developed Good Neighbor Practices endorsed by 300 companies; in Colorado, producers financed energy assistance for low-income families and seniors.
 Natural gas is produced daily, providing jobs and revenues while protecting the land and the environment. However, this story is seldom told.

HEADLINE: Asian Reaction to Unocal Bid Is Muted 

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, June 28 

 BODY:
While the Chinese bid for Unocal has brought calls for a national security review in the United States, the reaction in Southeast Asia, where Unocal has most of its assets, is much more muted. 
 Unocal seems to have put aside political uncertainty and controversy to develop energy assets from gas fields in the Gulf of Thailand to oil wells and gas platforms off the eastern coast of Borneo in Indonesia. Unocal, based in California, has assets in Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam that account for more than half of its worldwide reserves and 60 percent of its global production.
 Relations between Unocal, and Thailand, where it has been since 1962, are complicated. By providing three-fifths of Thailand's natural gas, Unocal single-handedly accounts for 30 percent of the country's overall energy supply. 
 If the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or Cnooc, succeeds with its $18.5 billion bid it would instantly become a leading player in Southeast Asia's energy industry, part of a wider move by Chinese oil companies to snap up energy supplies around the world and reduce the nation's reliance on Western oil companies. 
 But so far, the prospect of such a deal has produced little public reaction. Many Southeast Asian officials and analysts say they feel protected by long-term contracts that lock in Unocal's existing sales agreements for up to 30 years.
 ''Nothing's going to change in terms of business dynamics in the Gulf of Thailand,'' said Kitti Nathisuwan, energy analyst at Macquarie Securities in Bangkok. Unocal's gas is all sold to Thailand's state-controlled oil company PTT, which controls access to the pipelines carrying it from the Gulf of Thailand, he said. 
 Yet some analysts said they were concerned about Cnooc's long-term role. While Unocal's existing production may be contractually committed, Unocal is sitting on vast untapped reserves. 
 Unlike the American and European companies that have dominated Asian exploration and production, Cnooc's primary focus is providing for China's energy needs. 
 That has led some analysts to express concern that Cnooc might not prove to be the best broker for its oil and gas, either diverting supplies to China that are needed closer to home or selling them to China too cheaply.
 Unocal's history in Southeast Asia highlights a pattern: putting profits ahead of politics has put Unocal in hot water. Like oil companies elsewhere, it has made friends with unpopular regimes and survived their downfalls. It invested in the Philippines under President Ferdinand V. Marcos and stayed when he was overthrown in 1986. Likewise, it came to Indonesia as Suharto was taking power after an abortive Communist uprising and it increased its investments there as riots brought him down in 1998. 
 In 1990, as it struggled under $6 billion in debt accumulated fending off a hostile raid by T. Boone Pickens and fought higher emissions standards for its California refineries, Unocal said that for the first time it would spend more on exploration overseas than in the United States. Among other destinations, Unocal went to Myanmar, where it invested in a project with Total of France to pipe gas from offshore across rebel-held territory into Thailand. Unocal stayed in Myanmar even after the Clinton administration imposed sanctions in 1997, forbidding further investments. Unocal still holds a 28 percent stake in the project. 
 This year, Unocal settled lawsuits filed in state and federal courts on behalf of villagers in Myanmar contending that as a minority shareholder, Unocal bore responsibility for military abuses committed during construction of the pipeline. Unocal maintains that it did nothing wrong and argues that to the contrary, its involvement in Myanmar has raised living conditions, providing better health care and more schools.
 It is unclear what role Cnooc would play in Unocal's stead. China is a leading supplier of arms to Myanmar's junta. Critics of Unocal's investment there said it helped finance such arms purchases, while analysts said the project helped offset Myanmar's growing dependence on China for hard currency. 
 It is also unclear how Vietnam would respond to a Cnooc takeover of Unocal, which has two concessions to develop gas off Vietnam's southwest coast. China invaded Vietnam in 1979 and Vietnam still considers China a political and economic threat.
 Cnooc has a clearer strategic interest, however, in Indonesia, where it has been amassing assets. In 2002, it bought the Indonesian assets of the Spanish oil company Repsol for $585 million as well as a 12.5 percent stake in one of the country's largest natural gas projects, BP's Tangguh liquefied natural gas operation, a stake it has since raised to roughly 17 percent. Cnooc has said it hopes to ship liquefied natural gas to China from another plant, Bontang, where Unocal's gas goes now.
 In 2002, Tangguh won a contract to supply liquefied natural gas to a terminal being built in Fujian, which is controlled by Cnooc. But analysts said having Cnooc on both sides of the deal set a poor precedent for its future in Indonesia's oil and gas. 
 ''The price was very low, very cheap,'' said the head of the Center for Petroleum and Energy Economics Studies in Indonesia, Kurtubi, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. ''In the future, our L.N.G. will probably be sold to China at a very low price.''
 In Thailand, which has long been a staunch ally of the United States, a close kinship with China appears to have mitigated the kind of mistrust big Chinese investments are attracting in the United States.
 ''I think in Thailand we have such a close relationship with both the United States and China,'' said Pitak Intrawitayanunt, a former deputy prime minister who now runs a foundation for community development projects in Bangkok. ''So we don't have any really serious concern on this matter one way or another.''

HEADLINE: Senate Bill Strives to Balance Oil and Alternatives

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28 

 BODY:
The Senate overwhelmingly passed broad energy legislation on Tuesday, with its authors hoping the bill strikes a balance between traditional and alternative sources of power that can break a four-year Congressional stalemate over energy policy.
 By a bipartisan vote of 85 to 12, the Senate approved a bill that includes $14 billion in tax incentives for oil and gas production as well as development of wind, solar and other emerging energy sources. It also rewards buyers of energy-efficient appliances and hybrid cars. The measure includes an additional $36 billion in energy-related projects, though many of them will require additional approval by Congress. 
 The shape of the Senate measure sets up a clash with the House, which has already passed its own version emphasizing increased domestic oil and gas production. The House also included a controversial plan to grant product liability immunity to producers of the gasoline additive MTBE, which has polluted groundwater around the nation. 
 The White House also objects to parts of the Senate bill, challenging its cost and its plan to require utilities to use more renewable fuels to generate electricity.
 Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico and chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, acknowledged the difficulties ahead. But Mr. Domenici said he believed that mounting pressure to produce a new national energy policy after years of impasse would lead to the differences being resolved.
 ''We have matters that are in disagreement, but I can say they are far less in importance than the matter before us, which is to get an energy bill,'' he said.
 President Bush is pressing Congress to deliver a bill soon. Before the Sept. 11 attacks shifted the focus of the administration, a new energy policy was at the top of the White House's legislative list and remains a priority, particularly with the rising cost of gasoline and natural gas. But fights over MTBE and the emphasis on additional oil and gas production have shadowed the legislation since 2001. 
 Authors of the bill acknowledge that the new plan will do little immediately to reduce the cost to consumers of either gasoline or natural gas. But they say the push to develop new sources of fuel and diversify the nation's power sources will eventually lower prices as well as reduce pollution from traditional fossil fuels. 
 ''In the long term, it puts in place some good policies that will move us in directions that will be very beneficial to American consumers, American industry and the American economy generally,'' said Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the senior Democrat on the energy panel, who worked closely with Mr. Domenici.
 Critics of the bill say it falls far short of what the nation could accomplish and does nothing to force changes in automotive fuel consumption. 
 The bill does direct the president to find ways to reduce overall consumption by one million barrels of oil a day by 2015, but the Senate rejected a broader goal of reducing oil imports by 40 percent within 20 years. Senators also rejected efforts to require limits on emissions believed to contribute to global warming.
 ''I voted against the energy bill because it is short on the truly bold action needed to break this country's addiction to foreign oil, and long on the traditional boondoggles that waste taxpayer money and fail to promote energy independence,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. 
 The Senate bill would require gasoline refineries to add at least eight billion gallons of biofuels like corn-based ethanol to the nation's gas supplies by 2012, a provision critical to gaining support from farm-state senators. 
 Both the House and Senate measures also include proposals to strengthen the nation's power grid and prevent blackouts. The Senate bill also seeks to encourage a rebirth in nuclear power, an energy source that is a favorite of Mr. Domenici's. The measure takes no position on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- the House's bill allows drilling -- but senators hope to win drilling approval through a separate budget bill to be considered later this year.
 At a news conference with the Senate sponsors, Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman said the administration was ready to play a role in working on a final piece of legislation acceptable to Congress and the White House. 
 The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Representative Joe L. Barton of Texas, said he was eager to achieve a final deal as well.
 ''Obviously the House and Senate bills have differences to work out, and that is what conference committees are for,'' Mr. Barton said. 
 Mr. Barton and Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican leader, have been the chief proponents of providing oil companies that produce MTBE with some protection from lawsuits over the cost of cleanup from pollution caused by leaking underground gas tanks. MTBE makes water undrinkable, but there is no conclusive evidence on health risks for low doses.
 They say they can find a compromise that would avoid another Senate filibuster over the MTBE provision. In recent days, some lawmakers have been exploring the idea of adding the MTBE protection to a pending highway bill.
 ''We'll do whatever it takes to do this solution, wherever we can put it,'' Mr. DeLay told reporters.

HEADLINE: Forrester Attacks Corzine on Environment for Views on Petty's Island Project

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI and DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 28 

 BODY:
Trying to force Senator Jon S. Corzine to choose between two pivotal groups of supporters -- environmentalists and Democratic power brokers -- New Jersey's Republican candidate for governor, Douglas R. Forrester, called on Tuesday for an end to construction on Petty's Island. The state's Democratic Party bosses have thwarted efforts to establish a wildlife preserve and are supporting construction of a golf resort on the island.
 Petty's Island, just west of Camden in the Delaware River, became a political battlefield two years ago when two bald eagles imperiled the development plans by building a nest and raising a chick there. But George E. Norcross III, a powerful Camden County Democrat, continued pushing for the project, and when the eaglet died -- state wildlife officials said it had been harassed by an ornithologist hired by the developers -- former Gov. James E. McGreevey's administration approved the plan. 
Speaking at a news conference with some of the state's environmental leaders, Mr. Forrester cited the project as a stunning example of the state's pay-to-play culture, which allows political bosses to profit at the expense of New Jersey residents. He said he was particularly incensed by the fact that the state appeared to have bowed to pressure from Mr. Norcross, whose political organization has helped raise millions of dollars for Democrats and wields immense clout in state government.
 ''When I'm governor, I have pledged, and will follow through on that pledge, to make sure that we don't have that kind of warped public policymaking,'' Mr. Forrester said. ''This is the sort of thing that costs taxpayers money.''
 Mr. Forrester said he was troubled that Mr. Corzine had not yet spoken out against the project and sought to remind voters that the senator has given more than $1 million to political organizations controlled by Mr. Norcross.
 In a six-paragraph response, Mr. Corzine staked out a wait-and-see approach, saying that he would not take a position on the project until it undergoes a more thorough environmental review. But he said he would not summarily oppose the project because it could bring desperately needed economic development to the blighted Camden waterfront.
 ''I have been and continue to be a very strong advocate for the protection of our open spaces and environmental heritage,'' Mr. Corzine said. ''We must and can, however, have urban redevelopment, economic prosperity and environmental protection.''
 Mr. Corzine also raised concerns that the company that owns the island, Citgo Petroleum, is only offering to make the 400-acre parcel a nature preserve to avoid the expense of having to clean up contamination caused by years of use as a shipping terminal and storage depot.
 Joseph J. Roberts Jr., a Democrat from Camden and the Assembly majority leader, praised Mr. Corzine for resisting political pressure and keeping an open mind about a project that could improve the economy of Camden and neighboring Pennsauken. ''I am disappointed that Mr. Forrester is attempting to politicize this,'' said Mr. Roberts, who has been an ally and business partner to Mr. Norcross. ''I don't know if he's ever been to Petty's Island, but perhaps he should go to Pennsauken himself with some of the local officials.''
 Mr. Corzine's remarks did little to reassure many of the state's leading environmentalists, most of whom have been enthusiastic allies in the past. 
 Maya K. Van Rossum, the Delaware Riverkeeper, said she was shocked and saddened that Mr. Corzine and other Democratic lawmakers had not taken a stand against the development. ''They will allow Petty's Island to be lost forever,'' she said. ''That's like watching someone drown, and letting it happen.''
 Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, said that regardless of what is motivating Citgo officials, the prospect of gaining a 400-acre nature preserve in the middle of a dense urban area was a historic opportunity. ''The only reason anyone would oppose it is for George Norcross and his buddies to make money,'' Mr. Tittel said. ''So this is an easy choice.''
 In recent months, Mr. Corzine has disappointed environmentalists by expressing support for the Xanadu project at the Meadowlands in Bergen County, and by appointing Susan Bass Levin, the former commissioner of the state's Department of Community Affairs, as his campaign's chief of operations. Last year, Ms. Levin, who was the mayor in Cherry Hill for 14 years, supported a new state law that eased regulations on building while overseeing New Jersey's development projects. 
 Mr. Tittel said that Mr. Corzine's refusal to oppose the Petty's Island development has left some Sierra Club board members so disenchanted that they have suggested rescinding their endorsement.

HEADLINE: 3 Black Men Attacked in Howard Beach Hate Crime, the Police Say

BYLINE: By MICHELLE O'DONNELL and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM; Reporting for this article was contributed by Kareem Fahim, Janon Fisher, Jennifer 8. Lee and Marc Santora.

 BODY:
A group of white men set upon three black men on the streets of Howard Beach, Queens, early yesterday, beating one with a baseball bat and fracturing his skull, the police and prosecutors said.
 The white men, who emerged from a black 2005 Cadillac Escalade before dawn, sent the black men fleeing into nearby swampland and through the streets of the largely white, insular neighborhood. One of the black men, Glenn Moore, 22, of St. Albans, Queens, tripped over a lawn. There, his assailants beat him with a metal bat, stole the sneakers off his feet and ripped an earring from one ear, the police said.
Mr. Moore suffered injuries to his head, back and legs and was in Jamaica Hospital Medical Center last night, listed in serious condition. His girlfriend's sister said he was going in and out of consciousness. 
 The police said they had taken Nicholas Minucci, a 19-year-old unemployed man from Howard Beach, into custody, and a senior law enforcement official said he would be charged with assault in the first degree as a hate crime, which carries a sentence of from 8 to 25 years. The police said that Mr. Minucci had admitted to part of the crime, and that he had given a videotaped confession. 
 The event took place mere blocks from the site of a 1986 attack in which a group of about a dozen white men set upon three black men whose car had broken down in the neighborhood, forcing one of the men to run for his life. He died when he was struck by a car. That assault ignited a furor in the city, leading to the appointment of a special prosecutor and laying bare a degree of racial tension in New York that would reverberate for years.
 Four white men from Howard Beach were tried, and three were convicted on manslaughter and assault charges and sent to prison. The fourth defendant, a 16-year-old, was acquitted of all charges. The episode and the ensuing unrest made Howard Beach all but synonymous with racial discord, and played out as a charged political and social drama for months.
 The details in the new attack, which were still emerging last night, appeared to be in some ways more complicated. Mr. Minucci, the accused, said that the three black men might have been looking at his jewelry earlier last week, and that he was responding to that when he came across them around 3 a.m. yesterday. For their part, two of the black men, according to police, admitted under questioning that they had been in the area with hopes of stealing a car.
 But one law enforcement official said that at the time of the attack, the black men had done nothing more than be in Howard Beach around 3 a.m. And another official said that Mr. Minucci told investigators that after the beating, his companion said, ''This is what you get if you want to rob white boys,'' finishing the sentence with a racial epithet.
 ''Crimes motivated by ethnic or racial bias, particularly those involving violence, can never be tolerated,'' the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said. ''Bias crimes will be aggressively investigated and prosecuted, and crimes motivated by hate are to be condemned, and when they do regrettably occur, they will be vigorously prosecuted and punished.''
 In 2004, Mr. Minucci pleaded guilty to assault in an unrelated case. In that case, he was charged with stabbing a 15-year-old outside a Broad Channel bar in 2002, but the defendant in that case died in an accident before the case could go to trial. In his plea, Mr. Minucci was treated as a youthful offender. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was briefed on yesterday's attack last night and went to the 106th Precinct in Queens, where he and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly spoke to reporters. ''The reason that we're here is that hate crimes will not be tolerated,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. Late last night, the Rev. Al Sharpton said that he had received a call from Mr. Bloomberg, assuring him that the city ''would not tolerate'' racial attacks, if this case proved to be one. 
 Mr. Kelly told reporters that the police were seeking Mr. Minucci's companions for questioning. He identified one of them as Anthony Ench, 24.
 According to law enforcement officials, the incident began shortly after 3 a.m., when Mr. Moore and his two companions were walking under the 84th Street overpass that crosses the Belt Parkway, which separates the enclave of Lindenwood from the rest of Howard Beach. It was then, the officials said, that the three men first encountered the black Escalade. 
 Mr. Minucci was alone in the car at the time, and he and the three black men exchanged what Commissioner Kelly said both sides described as a ''hard stare.''
 As the men walked into Howard Beach, near 157th Avenue, they saw the Escalade coming toward them, the officials said, adding that one of the black men told the others to ''post up,'' as if they were at a bus stop, and the black men stared at the Escalade, which drove on.
 They had walked several blocks further when, 10 to 15 minutes later, they saw the S.U.V. again, near 159th Avenue and 79th Street, and noticed that it now carried three white men. 
 It stopped, and the driver, Mr. Minucci, got out, threw an aluminum baseball bat at Mr. Moore, the police said, and began running after the men. Mr. Moore and his friends, who said they heard Mr. Minucci utter a racial epithet, fled. 
 As his two friends, whom the police later identified as Richard Wood, 20, and Richard Pope, 25, hid in the weeds of St. Helen's, a Roman Catholic church nearby, Mr. Moore hid behind a tree, where Mr. Minucci caught sight of his red shirt and ran after him, the police said. 
 As he ran away, Mr. Moore tripped on the lawn of a home at 159-43 79th Street, a white two-story house.
 There, Mr. Minucci came upon Mr. Moore, he told the police, and hit him in the back and in the legs with the bat. He did not admit to hitting Mr. Moore in the head with the bat, and said that Mr. Moore had injured his head on the curb. But the police said that the blow Mr. Moore suffered to his head caused a skull fracture. 
 While Mr. Minucci stood over Mr. Moore with the bat, the police said, another man from the Escalade pulled off Mr. Moore's Air Jordan sneakers, and stole a shopping bag containing another pair of shoes, which Mr. Moore's girlfriend, Andrea Gordon, said were a new pair of Prada dress shoes.
 Ms. Gordon said that a bag containing a new pair of Air Jordans for the couple's 6-month-old daughter, Amiyh, was also taken.
 The white men left in the Escalade, leaving Mr. Moore on the ground, where he was quickly rejoined by his friends and taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center.
 In interviews yesterday morning with detectives, Mr. Moore's companions said that they had been in the neighborhood to steal a car, a Chrysler 300, for which they had been paid $6,000 in advance, an official said. But Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman, said that at the time of the attack, the men had not committed a crime. 
 ''There is no indication from Minucci or anyone else that they were aware that Moore and the others were planning to steal cars,'' Mr. Browne said. ''There is no indication from them or anyone else that they were aware of that aspect of it.''Yesterday, as one of Mr. Moore's companions drove through the neighborhood with investigators to retrace the crime, they came across a black Escalade driven by Mr. Minucci, 
 Capt. Michael J. Osgood of the department's hate crime task force pulled over the car and found an aluminum bat and two pairs of shoes inside that matched the description of those taken, the police said.
 Last night, Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Moore had been charged in July 2003 with auto theft, and that Mr. Pope and Mr. Wood, who is also known as Robert Walker, had lengthy criminal histories.
 Yet the families of both Mr. Moore and Mr. Minucci said they were stunned and confused by the attack and charges. Mr. Moore's family said the plot to steal a car was out of character, while Mr. Minucci's relatives described him as a law-abiding young man.
 Chandra Eisen, Mr. Moore's mother, said that she doubted that her son, the oldest of four children, had any plan to steal a car, as he was due to receive a settlement from a childhood car accident and is currently collecting disability benefits from the Army. She said he had gotten into scrapes with the law from time to time, but that last night he was simply walking home with friends after visiting his girlfriend and daughter.
 In the short walk from the girlfriend's apartment, she said, they had wandered into the Howard Beach area. A few minutes after the first sighting of the Escalade and the stare-down, the S.U.V. circled back around, she quoted her son as saying. 
 ''Glenn said they were shouting, 'What do you think you are doing in this neighborhood?''' Mrs. Eisen said.
 Outside the tidy brick townhouse where Mr. Minucci lives with his mother on a tree-lined street with an ocean breeze, an uncle, Anthony Minucci, defended his nephew and said that he had not heard that he faced a hate crime charge. He said that his nephew was an ordinary boy, who was raised as a Roman Catholic and played Little League baseball when he was younger. ''He's not a racist,'' Mr. Minucci said. ''We're not racist. He's definitely not racist.''
 One woman, who gave her name only as Joanna, said that four years ago she had moved to the block where yesterday's attack took place. She said that she had little memory of even hearing the news accounts of the 1986 attack.
 ''I don't know if it was a racial thing or what,'' she said of yesterday's attack. ''I just didn't expect it.''

HEADLINE: Brazilians Streaming Into U.S. Through Mexican Border

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: BRAUNAS, Brazil 

 BODY:
For years, Jaider de Andrade, a 35-year-old farm worker, talked about going to the United States to look for work, and early in March he finally agreed to a trafficker's offer to fly him to Mexico and have him guided across the border there. By month's end, though, he was back home here again, in a coffin.
 ''His dream had always been for us to have a little house of our own, but he never could make enough here to get ahead,'' his widow, Nilce Aparecida Moreira da Silva, said at the couple's homestead. ''He knew there was some risk, but he wasn't nervous, because he saw that so many other people from around here had gone and done well in the United States.''
 Encouraged by highly organized groups of smugglers offering relatively cheap packages, Brazilians recently have been migrating in record numbers to the United States. 
 With direct entry to the United States tougher than in the past, more often than not their route of choice is through Mexico, which in recent years has stopped requiring entry visas of Brazilians.
 During just two days in late April, Border Patrol agents in south Texas detained 232 Brazilians who had entered the United States illegally. All told, more than 12,000 Brazilians have been apprehended trying to cross the United States-Mexican border this year, exceeding the number detained in all of 2004 and pushing Brazilians to the top of the category known as ''other than Mexicans.''
 Mexico, facing growing complaints from Washington, is now contemplating restoring visa formalities for Brazilians. That in turn has led to a fever among potential migrants here in the vast heartland of south-central Brazil to obtain a passport and head for Mexico before the door there starts swinging shut.
 At the Federal Police office in Governador Valadares, the main city in this fertile region of rolling hills, the line of people seeking passports each day stretches around the block. 
 Those waiting one afternoon did not want to talk with a reporter about their travel plans, but the Federal Police delegate for the region, Rui Antonio da Silva, estimated that 90 percent were headed for the United States via the Mexican route. ''We believe that just in this region there are about 30 gangs that offer this service to people,'' he said. ''It's a very lucrative business, and a lot of people are involved.''
 Mr. da Silva said that last year his office issued an average of about 45 passports a day. Since January the number has jumped to a daily average of 140. A few minutes later, an assistant came into his office. ''The numbers just don't stop growing,'' she said. ''We hit a new record today, more than 200 passports.''
 American authorities say that many of the trafficking gangs use travel agencies as fronts. Governador Valadares, a pleasant city of 250,000 in the sprawling inland state of Minas Gerais, which is the source of the majority of the Brazilians apprehended on the Mexican border, now has more than 100 such firms, up from 40 just a couple of years ago.
 People here who have been approached by trafficking rings said that the going rate at the moment for door-to-door transport to Boston, the preferred destination of illegal Brazilian immigrants, is about $10,500. That is more than two years' income for the average Brazilian, but effectively 30 percent less than a year ago, because the American dollar is weaker now.
 Brazilian officials and residents of this region said that unlike smuggling situations in many places, migrants do not pay in advance and do not pay at all if they fail to reach the United States, which greatly reduces the financial risk to potential migrants.
 Mr. de Andrade's widow said her husband had offered a small parcel of land he owned as collateral. After he died, in an automobile accident in northern Mexico, the smuggler returned the land.
 The accelerating outflow of people has come as a surprise to Brazilians and a blow to their self-image. This nation of 180 million has, after all, traditionally attracted millions of immigrants from Europe and Asia and prides itself on its social mobility.
 ''Just look at who our president is,'' Teresa Sales, the author of ''Brazilians Far From Home'' and a professor of sociology at the University of Campinas, said, referring to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a former lathe operator. ''In the past, even when things were going badly no one would have imagined leaving the country, because of the expectation of rising socially.''
 Not only that, but Brazil's economy has been doing well recently. Furthermore, many of those leaving are not poor peasants, but young people more educated than the general population, including architects, engineers and other professionals.
 ''What we have to accept that this flow has to do with lack of opportunity, not with poverty or unemployment,'' said Ana Cristina Braga Martes, a specialist in immigration issues at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a leading research institution. ''It's mainly the lower middle class from prosperous states, not the poor, who are going, and it's because they can't earn a fair wage here and have bought into the idea of the American dream.''
 One sure sign that ''making America'' has entered the popular imagination is that in March, Brazil's largest television network began broadcasting a soap opera called ''America,'' which follows a young woman's efforts to get to the United States through Mexico and to adjust to life in Florida. 
 Experts disagree about whether it is encouraging Brazilians to head north, but more than 40 million people are watching nightly.
 In an effort to discourage the flow, Brazilian priests in Massachusetts have recently published a letter on the Internet alerting illegal immigrants to the dangers they may confront on their way to the United States. 
 ''When they don't die, the migrants are subjected to violence or raped, and experience humiliating situations like sleeping in cemeteries, walking for miles and miles through the desert or drinking water from sewers,'' their document warns.
 Since the 1960's, Governador Valadares has sent a stream of immigrants to Boston and nearby cities, but the stream has been growing larger. Mayor Jose Bonifacio Mourao estimates that 40,000 people from his city have emigrated to the United States. ''Almost every family, including mine, has relatives in the United States,'' he said.
 But American authorities report increases in illegal immigration from all of Brazil's southern, more prosperous states. ''It is as if we have infected other regions with the migratory virus,'' said Weber Soares, a research specialist in immigration issues at the Vale do Rio Doce University in Governador Valadares.
 The Brazilian government estimates that between 1.5 million and three million Brazilians are living abroad, most in the United States or Japan. Last year, according to a congressional estimate, the emigrants sent nearly $6 billion in remittances back to Brazil, or about the same amount earned by Brazil's leading export product, soybeans.
 Until a few years ago most Brazilians living illegally in the United State went as tourists and simply overstayed their visas. But that changed when the United States tightened visa requirements after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and Mexico changed its visa policy.
 ''We started because it was something the business community asked for and to deter the mafia falsifying visas around our consulates,'' the Mexican ambassador to Brazil, Cecilia Soto, said in a telephone interview from Brasilia. ''But it has become a problem these last couple of years, and we have seen that the mafias of human traffickers in both countries are clearly working together.''
 She said Mexico planned to send an official delegation soon to discuss immigration problems.
 Many here maintain that any effort to crack down on trafficking schemes is bound to fail. The smuggling rings will not be eliminated, the argument goes, but only be driven deeper underground.
 ''Nothing indicates that this flow will diminish, despite the efforts to scare people into not going,'' Mayor Mourao said. ''The incentives to go up there to the U.S. are still high. If anything, the tendency is for the flow to increase.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Senate and Assembly Still Deadlocked on Budget a Day Before It Is Due 

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 29 

 BODY:
With just a day left to pass the state's budget on time, the Democratic leaders of the Senate and General Assembly failed on Wednesday night to resolve bitter disputes that threatened a financial and political crisis.
 Both houses remained deadlocked over two major issues, as they have been since Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey proposed a $27.4 billion budget in March: the size of rebates for residents who pay property taxes, and the size of new or increased taxes the government would need to help pay for those rebates.
If the two houses cannot reach a compromise by midnight Thursday, the constitutional deadline for a new budget, the government will not have any money to operate on Friday. Although officials have said that such a crisis would not affect emergency services, like law enforcement and health services, other services deemed nonessential, like parks and beaches, could be suspended. 
 ''If we don't get something done very early in the morning we could absolutely, possibly, not have a budget until Saturday or Sunday,'' said Senator Wayne R. Bryant of Camden, the chairman of the Senate's budget committee, after his committee approved a budget proposal Wednesday night.
 Failure to reach a budget compromise would be a political embarrassment for the Democrats, who control both legislative houses and the governor's office. It would enable the Republicans to portray the Democrats as being unable to overcome internal differences and govern. And for Democrats in the Assembly, the political consequences could be all the more troubling because they are facing elections in November.
 ''This is an appalling way to govern,'' said Leonard Lance, the Senate minority leader, ''and it demonstrates that we need a Republican governor, and a Republican Legislature.''
 But Louis D. Greenwald, a Democrat from Camden County who is chairman of the Assembly budget committee, dismissed such grousing. ''If they're looking to make some tee time somewhere, they should let us know,'' he said, ''but I'll fight to the end of time to make sure that we get rebates and property tax relief for seniors and working families.''
 Budget season in Trenton often goes down to the last minute. The two parties, and sometimes factions within one party, can differ on substantive issues, only to come together in a flurry of late-night, back-room negotiating to emerge with a budget on time, give or take a few hours or a day or two.
 But this year, the budget process has been unusual because of the personalities and politics involved. On one side are Assembly Democrats, led by the majority leader, Joseph J. Roberts Jr. of Camden County, who is believed to be in line to succeed Speaker Albio Sires of Hudson County, who is retiring. On the other side is Mr. Codey of Essex County, who is not only the acting governor, but also the Senate president, and has never been close to Mr. Roberts.
 When Mr. Codey presented his budget plan in March, he proposed to eliminate or suspend $1.1 billion in property tax rebates because of the state's troubled finances. But in May, when state officials estimated that the state would get an additional $1.5 billion in revenues over the next two years because of an unexpectedly robust economy, Mr. Roberts led the fight to fully fund the rebates, without new or increased taxes, by cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in proposed spending.
 On Wednesday night, the two houses intensified their brinkmanship by introducing separate budget proposals that featured substantial differences. The Senate budget committee passed a proposal along party lines that featured $450 million in property tax rebates. It also included more than $200 million in suggested tax increases, which the Assembly Democrats have said they would probably reject.
 The Assembly budget committee passed its own budget proposal to fully restore property tax rebates, without increasing taxes, unless one considers a plan to take $300 million from the reserves of Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield to be a de facto tax.
 While Assembly Democrats defended the Horizon proposal as legitimate because of the insurer's nonprofit tax status, administration officials said it may be illegal. And Mr. Codey was angered by the Assembly's entire package. ''The public deserves better than phony numbers and false promises,'' he said. ''But if people insist on gimmicks, we will be here for a long time because I intend to be honest with the public.''

HEADLINE: To the Chagrin of Detroit, Top 10 No Longer, More People Know the Way to San Jose

BYLINE: By JEREMY PETERS; Carolyn Marshall contributed reporting from San Francisco for this article.

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 29 

 BODY:
Cynics have signed this city's death certificate time and time again. But even for the many others who say Detroit is not dead, just on the cusp of an economic revival, the numbers are hard to ignore.
 On Thursday, the Census Bureau will release its latest population statistics, showing that Detroit was not on the list of the top 10 most populous American cities for the first time since the 1900 census. San Jose, Calif., has taken its place. 
 Although the two cities are separated by a mere 4,324 people, in many ways they could not be further apart. Detroit, the Motor City, is the hub of the American auto industry and a microcosm of the nation's declining industrial base. The computer chips of San Jose, in the heart of Silicon Valley, are what have replaced the sheet metal and molten steel of Detroit in the new American economy.
 ''It's part of a pattern for the heavily industrialized cities, but I think Detroit is a specific case,'' said Dana Johnson, chief economist at Comerica Bank in Detroit. ''There's been an ongoing dynamic here of people, middle-class people in Detroit, fleeing the city looking for better schools, better lifestyles, better services. So it has been a particularly hard fall.''
 The new census data show that other heavily industrial Midwestern cities are shrinking as well. Of the 10 cities with the largest population declines between 2000 and 2004, seven were in the Midwest. New York remained the nation's biggest city, with 8,104,079 people, followed by Los Angeles, which the Census Bureau measured at 3,845,541.
 The fact that Detroit is shrinking is nothing new. Detroit has clung to its position on the list of the 10 most populous cities since the 2000 census when it first dropped below 1 million people. That was a stinging blow for a city that was the nation's fourth largest in 1950. Since then, it has shrunk in every census. The latest figures recorded 900,198 people, half the population of 50 years ago.
 Still, some city leaders say Detroit is just beginning its economic and social renaissance. 
 ''Sufficient groundwork has been laid for new investment that will increase the housing stock, jobs, and it portends for a good future for the city of Detroit,'' former Mayor Dennis Archer said. ''I don't think anybody, with all due respect, pays much attention to a city's population.'' 
 To walk around downtown Detroit is a lesson in contrasts. On any given summer afternoon, people fill cafe tables on sidewalks while construction workers hammer away at new loft apartment buildings. But past 6 p.m., with workers back home in the suburbs and the construction crews gone, the city becomes a ghost town. 
 In this city, where four professional sports teams drive much of the economy, a nighttime Detroit Tigers game is one occasions when the downtown springs to life at night. In the winter, Red Wings hockey games have drawn suburbanites into the city. But with the National Hockey League shut down this past season, many local bars and restaurants that depend on Red Wings traffic saw their business slow to a trickle.
 In San Jose, where the Sharks, an N.H.L. franchise, are the only professional sports team, the tech boom brought with it a construction boom downtown. Museums, a convention center and light-rail trolleys were put in, and streets were transformed into pedestrian promenades. 
 On the unofficial but closely watched ''Best Of'' lists, San Jose is a perennial performer. It has also been called one of America's best-managed cities, not to mention one of the most livable. In Detroit, ''Best Of'' accolades are hard to come by. Time magazine recently named Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick one of the nation's three worst mayors. His office declined to make him available for comment.
 Part of the fallout from Detroit's population drain has been a sharp cutback in city services. 
 ''You don't have the resources to stay vibrant if the tax base is declining,'' said David Littmann, a retired economist and longtime observer of the Michigan economy. 
 With a $300 million budget shortfall projected next year, more than 700 police officers and firefighters face layoffs. When the school year ended this month, 34 public schools closed for the last time. 
 The problem is not that people are leaving Michigan. It is that they continue to leave Detroit for the suburbs north and west of the city. With 5.5 million people, Detroit has the nation's eighth largest metropolitan area, according to the 2000 census.
 Not that San Jose has been without its economic hardships. The city was hit hard when the dot-com bubble burst and has a 5.5 percent unemployment rate. That is higher than the 5.1 percent jobless rate nationwide but still lower than in metropolitan Detroit where 7.8 percent of the labor force is unemployed. 
 As manufacturing jobs have left Michigan and the Midwest, metro Detroit has experienced growth in business services. Employment in the public sector has also increased over the past two decades. ''It's just not as attractive as the competition elsewhere,'' Mr. Littmann said.
 Still, Detroit loyalists like Mr. Archer refuse to throw up their hands. ''A lot of cities have their ups and downs,'' he said. ''The city of Detroit has had its downs and we've had our ups. Now it's time for us to go back up.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday comparing Detroit with San Jose, which displaced it as the nation's 10th most populous city, referred incorrectly to the San Jose Sharks hockey team. It is one of several professional sports teams in the city, not the only one. (Others include the Earthquakes, soccer; the SaberCats, arena football; the Giants, baseball; and Stealth, lacrosse.)

HEADLINE: Economic Growth Revised Upward 

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29 

 BODY:
The economy grew at a 3.8 percent rate in the first quarter of 2005, a performance that was better than previously thought and a fresh sign the expansion is on firm footing.
 The new reading on gross domestic product was an improvement from the 3.5 percent annual rate estimated for the quarter just a month ago and matched the showing registered in the final quarter of 2004. 
 Gross domestic product, the broadest gauge of the economy's health, measures the value of all goods and services produced within the United States.
 Stronger spending on housing, more investment by business in equipment and software, and a trade deficit that was less of a drag on economic growth all played a role in the higher first-quarter estimate.
 The first quarter's showing was slightly better than the 3.7 percent growth rate that economists had forecast before the report was released.
 The economy in the current April-to-June quarter is expected to expand anywhere from 2.6 percent to 3.8 percent. Some earlier forecasts had put growth for the quarter at a pace of around 4 percent. Projections for the third quarter range from a 2.7 percent to a 3.5 percent pace.
 In the first quarter, though, spending and investment in a variety of areas fared well despite high energy prices.

HEADLINE: U.S. Said to Plan Rackets Lawsuit On Dock Union

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
Federal authorities are preparing to file a sweeping civil racketeering lawsuit against the International Longshoremen's Association, officials who were briefed on the case said yesterday. It would be the government's most aggressive attempt ever to wrest the nation's Atlantic and Gulf Coast docks and the union that represents their workers from what prosecutors say is a half-century of control by two powerful New York mob clans.
 Over several decades, the union, which is based in New York and represents 50,000 dockworkers and other employees at three dozen ports from Maine to Texas, came to symbolize organized crime's grip on labor and its exploitation of union members. The 1954 film ''On the Waterfront'' was based on the union, which over the years has evaded some of the most savvy prosecutors, even as some local union officials were indicted and convicted in the plundering of union funds and related businesses. 
 The union has also been the subject of a range of inquiries, including Senate hearings in the 1950's, the President's Commission on Organized Crime in the 1980's and lawsuits focusing on individual locals.
 But prosecutors in Brooklyn, with evidence developed in a recent series of criminal cases aimed at organized crime on the piers, and with the cooperation of a major waterfront mob figure, hope to succeed where others have failed, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the lawsuit has not yet been filed. Using the federal civil racketeering law known as RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, the government will seek to take over the union and several union benefit plans, one official said.
 Prosecutors will also ask a federal judge to permanently bar five top union leaders, including the president, John Bowers; the secretary-treasurer, Robert E. Gleason; and the executive vice president, Albert Cernadas, from playing any role in the union or any of its pension benefit or welfare funds, the officials said. They will also seek to bar several reputed mob figures from the Gambino and Genovese families, the two groups prosecutors have said controlled the union for decades, from involvement with the union or any of its funds, the officials said.
 ''This is the culmination of years and years of investigations and other actions brought in connection with organized crime's connection to the I.L.A.,'' one of the officials said. ''From the 50's all the way through the 90's, with the focus on the locals and bringing cases against many, many people over the years, there is a long history of effort that forms the bedrock of this case.''
 The lawsuit is being brought by the office of the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Roslynn R. Mauskopf. It will say that Mr. Bowers, Mr. Gleason, Mr. Cernadas and two other union officials conspired with Gambino and Genovese mobsters to rig the 2000 election of high-ranking association leaders to ensure that a longtime Genovese associate would be in a position to succeed Mr. Bowers upon his eventual retirement, several officials said. 
 It will also say that the three top officials, along with Harold J. Daggett, a longtime Genovese associate and the union's assistant general organizer, and a union vice president, Arthur Coffey, conspired with members and associates of the two mob families to award union welfare and pension benefit fund contracts to companies tied to the mob.
 Mr. Cernadas, Mr. Daggett and Mr. Coffey were charged last year in federal court in Brooklyn with extortion and conspiracy to control business on the docks in New York, New Jersey and Florida. They pleaded not guilty and are on paid leave from their union posts. 
 The union, in a statement released by its special counsel, Joseph D. McCann, said it had cooperated with the investigation and carried out substantial reforms, creating a code of conduct, instituting a hot line to report corruption and hiring a former judge and a former prosecutor to oversee its ethical practices. Milton Mollen, who is retired from the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, will watch over the union, and Andrew J. Maloney, a former Brooklyn United States attorney, will oversee the benefit funds.
 ''We are disappointed that the government has leaked its intention to bring a civil RICO complaint even as we are engaging in negotiations with them,'' the statement said. ''The government's action is likely to have a devastating economic impact on I.L.A. members and the shipping industry.''
 Efforts yesterday to reach the five I.L.A. officials through the union were unsuccessful.
 One official said that 26 members of the association's executive council would also be named in the lawsuit.
 The United States' attorney's office, along with the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, the F.B.I. and the United States Department of Labor Inspector General's office, conducted the investigation over several years, one official said.
 Among the criminal cases that helped develop the evidence on which the civil RICO suit is based were two that resulted in a dozen convictions of reputed Genovese and Gambino crime family figures, one of the officials said. One case was the 2003 racketeering conviction of Peter Gotti, then the acting boss of the Gambino family, on conspiracy and money laundering charges that included accusations that the family controlled the main longshoremen's local in New York. A former I.L.A. official, Anthony Ciccone, whom prosecutors identified as a Gambino captain, and Jerome Brancato, who they said was a Gambino soldier, were also convicted in that case.
 In the second case, Liborio S. Bellomo, the former acting boss of the Genovese family, and another man were indicted on charges arising from what prosecutors said were their efforts to launder money they siphoned from I.L.A. benefit funds between 1996 and 1997.

HEADLINE: A More Perfect Union

BYLINE: By Ruth Milkman. 
Ruth Milkman, a sociologist, is director of U.C.L.A.'s Institute of Industrial Relations and a visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation.

 BODY:
IT is a time of trial for organized labor. Only 13 percent of nonagricultural workers are unionized. The figure is even lower among immigrants who toil at unskilled jobs in the nation's newest industries. Employers have abandoned the paternalistic job security measures, pensions and fringe benefits of which they boasted only a few years ago. Instead, they are imposing wage cuts and speedups on their workers while the American Federation of Labor stands by helplessly. 
 Sound familiar? This was the labor movement's plight in 1935. Like many Americans today, people back then believed that labor unions had become weak and irrelevant. In 1932, George Barnett, president of the American Economics Association, declared, ''American trade unionism is slowly being limited in influence by changes which destroy the basis on which it is erected.'' Yet a few years later, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, an insurgent group within organized labor born out of a debate that few outsiders bothered to follow, set off America's greatest surge of unionism. That growth continued, peaking at 35 percent of the workforce just before the two rival labor federations reunited in 1955, forming today's A.F.L.-C.I.O. 
Now the unionization rate has sunk to about 8 percentof all private-sector non-farm workers. Globalization and the service economy have displaced the mass production industries that produced the last great internal union upheaval 70 years ago. Those industries, and the New Deal legal and political order that the C.I.O. helped shape, have been weakened beyond recognition.
 Next month, at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. annual convention in Chicago, a sharpening dispute over how labor should meet these challenges will reach a turning point. A dissident group led by Andy Stern, who heads the 1.8 million-member Service Employees International Union (the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s largest affiliate), is trying to oust John Sweeney, the federation's president, and engineer a major shift in organized labor's strategy. Outspoken and impatient, Mr. Stern has angered his colleagues in union circles by threatening to pull his union out of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. if his reform program is not adopted. But for all his abrasiveness, his program offers labor's best hope -- maybe its only hope -- for revitalization. 
 Mr. Stern's Change to Win program calls for a one-union-per-industry model that would curb competition among unions and increase the organizing capacity of those that remain. Changing job descriptions have rendered many traditional union jurisdictions obsolete, so that unions often end up competing against one another for members. Merging industry unions would also make it harder for employers to play off one union against another. 
 Consider the airline industry: at least five unions represent pilots, three represent flight attendants and six represent ground crews and ticket agents. This balkanization has made it harder for unions to fight assaults on their livelihood by companies like United Airlines, which recently shed its pension obligations, opening the door for other airlines to threaten their workers with the same fate. Today, federal, state and local government employees are scattered among 13 unions, and health care workers among more than 30. 
 The proposed consolidation of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s 58 affiliates threatens many vested interests, not least those of the officials who head smaller unions. But a handful of the largest unions -- the Teamsters, Laborers, Unite Here and United Food and Commercial Workers -- have embraced Mr. Stern's reform agenda. These unions make up 40 percent of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s membership, and may join the service employees union in bolting from the federation if they lose their bid to transform it. 
 The insurgents have also called for spending $60 million -- about half the federation's budget -- on organizing, versus the $22.5 million that Mr. Sweeney has offered. They argue that if labor is going to survive, its most urgent priority must be increasing the percentage of unionized Americans. But only a few A.F.L.-C.I.O. unions -- most of them Mr. Stern's allies -- have put more money and effort into organizing. 
 Ten years ago, Mr. Sweeney -- who was Mr. Stern's predecessor as the service employees union president and his onetime mentor -- was elected to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. presidency on a platform of ''organizing the unorganized.'' But because he presides over a federation of unions whose current structure does not allow him to enforce his will, Mr. Sweeney has been unable to reverse the tide of union decline. That's why another key plank in the Change to Win platform is to strengthen the power of the central federation itself. 
 The service employees union's track record is the best case for taking its proposal seriously: it has tripled in size over the past quarter-century, as membership in most other unions plunged. It is on the front lines of the nation's service-based economy, the leading edge of the race to the bottom that threatens to drag down labor standards for the rest of us. And with an eye on globalization's impact, its building service division has formed alliances with unions overseas to advance its organizing in the United States, where janitors and security guards are often employed by foreign-owned companies that offer workers in their home countries better pay and working conditions. 
 With unions in decline, real wages for hourly workers are stagnant, their health and pension benefits are in tatters, and inequalities between rich and poor have widened to levels not seen since the 1920's and early 1930's -- just before the last great union surge. Given a chance, Mr. Stern's proposals can restore labor as the counterforce it once was in an era that saw remarkable gains in prosperity for all Americans.

HEADLINE: For First Time in Months, Army Meets Its Recruiting Goal

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29 

 BODY:
For the first time since January, the Army met its recruiting goal this month, but it still faces what some senior Army officials say is a nearly insurmountable hurdle to meet the service's annual quota. 
 Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a public forum at the Pentagon on Wednesday that the Army exceeded its June goal, but he gave no details. Senior Army officials said in interviews earlier in the day that the Army exceeded the quota of 5,650 recruits by about 500 people. The Army Reserve also made its first monthly goal since last December, the officials said. 
 That still leaves the active-duty Army about 7,800 recruits behind schedule to send 80,000 enlistees to boot camp with only three months to go in the recruiting year that ends on Sept. 30. The Army has not missed its annual enlistment quota since 1999, when a strong economy made recruiters' lives miserable. 
 Army officials publicly insist that they can still reach their annual goal, especially with hundreds of new recruiters on the street for the peak summer recruiting month, armed with big enlistment bonuses and greater leeway to recruit more high-school dropouts and lower-achieving applicants. 
 But privately, senior Army officials voiced skepticism on Wednesday that the Army could make up the deficit.
 ''If you ask people point-blank, we just don't have enough time left to make it,'' said an Army official who has been briefed on the June figures, but who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the Pentagon does not plan to release them publicly until early July. 
 Another senior Army officer, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said, ''If we make it, it'll be by the skin of our teeth.'' 
 Recruiting woes plaguing the Army and the Marine Corps, partly over parental concerns about the war in Iraq, have raised such concern among members of Congress that the Senate Armed Services Committee has summoned General Myers and the chiefs of the Army and the Marines to testify on Thursday. Of the 139,000 troops in Iraq, the Army provides about 105,000 and the Marines about 22,000. 
 ''We face a challenge in recruiting right now, especially for the ground forces like the Army and the Marine Corps,'' Gen. Peter Pace, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, told the committee at a separate hearing Wednesday on his nomination to succeed General Myers as chairman. 
 For example, Marine recruiters are spending an average of 12 hours per recruit they enlist, up from about 3 hours a year or so ago, Marine officials say. 
 General Pace noted that while recruiting numbers were down, re-enlistments are above averages in past years, making up some of the gap.
 ''Those within uniform serving this country get it,'' General Pace said. 
 In his nationally televised speech on Tuesday night, President Bush ended his address with a recruiting pitch. ''I thank those of you who have re-enlisted in an hour when your country needs you,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And to those watching tonight who are considering a military career, there is no higher calling than service in our armed forces.''

 BODY:
Bank of America, after absorbing FleetBoston last year in a $50 billion deal, now has 5,800 branches in 30 states. J.P. Morgan Chase, having bought Bank One for $60 billion in stock in another 2004 mega-merger, now counts 2,500 branches. Royal Bank of Scotland, the parent of Citizens Bank, increased its presence in the United States to 1,500 branches after its acquisition of Charter One, also last year. 
 Then there is the Western National Bank in Phoenix. It has a single location, at the intersection of 24th Street and Camelback Road, on the ground floor of an officer tower in a business district known as the Camelback Corridor. And it does not even have a drive-through window, because the entrepreneur who opened it in February could not find a piece of real estate that would accommodate one.
What it does have is a cobalt-blue counter shaded by a beige umbrella, where a teller takes deposits from customers who drive up to the curb and hands them a free 12-ounce bottle of spring water. 
 ''Our customers absolutely love it,'' said William D. Hinz II, the 39-year-old owner, who prefers to be called Bill.
 Aside from roadside deposits, Western National offers a courier service to pick up deposits from small-business customers and gives out toy safes for the children of the personal account holders. 
 It is touches like those that Mr. Hinz says will snare customers frustrated with the impersonal faces of the giants. Customers, he says, want to be greeted by name and treated as though their $2,000 savings accounts or $50,000 small-business loans really matter to Western National. 
 ''We found that especially with small-business lending and banking, being able to know your customer is critical,'' he said. ''Being part of the community in which they work is critical. The big bank networks aren't really built to take care of smaller loans.'' 
 He should know. He started three banks with backing from a larger bank holding company, Capitol Bancorp Ltd., which ultimately bought all of them. For the new bank, he raised the money from local investors and his own savings.
 So far, his business strategy is paying off. In just four months, Western National has accumulated more than 400 accounts and about $32 million in assets, more than twice his goal. And while he had estimated it would take 18 months to become profitable, he now predicts it will take less than a year. 
 Mr. Hinz belongs to a hearty band of entrepreneurs, many of them former managers of small banks that were gobbled up by the big boys, who smelled opportunity in customers' longing to be pampered. While competing against the likes of Bank of America can be daunting, they say, the Internet has given them tools that were not available before. 
 ''We're seeing more small community banks popping up,'' especially in rapidly growing areas like the Northwest and the Southeast, said Joe Gillen, founding partner and chief executive of Pinnacle Financial Strategies, a consulting firm in Houston. ''People want to bank with people, not machines.'' 
 While the consolidation of the banking industry has reduced the overall number of banks in the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation says the number of community bank charters has been on the rise since faltering right after the Internet bubble burst, with 112 issued last year, up from 79 in 2002.
 This comeback, as Rich Brown, the F.D.I.C.'s chief economist described it, is partly a result of the cyclical nature of the economy. But, Mr. Brown said, another factor is service to niches, like small businesses or ethnic groups. ''The stock in trade of small banks is customization,'' he said. 
 Small community banks have other advantages, too, according to Frank Gonzales, head of the financial-services practice at the accounting and consulting firm Morrison, Brown, Argiz & Farra in Miami. Their overhead tends to be lower, he said, and new technology enables them to clear checks just as quickly as their larger rivals. 
 The power of the personal touch has not been lost on the larger banks, of course. After its acquisition of Fleet, Bank of America dispatched greeters at the door to offer help to customers, for example. It also tailors products to ethnic groups and has bilingual employees at branches in areas with large non-English-speaking populations. 
 Still, marketing to narrowly defined population groups remains the domain of smaller banks. For example, BankBlackwell, which in March became the first black-owned bank in a decade to obtain a federal charter, says it will aim mostly at middle-class and upper-middle-class blacks throughout the nation. It has headquarters in Boston, but will conduct business only on its Web site or by phone or mail.
 BankBlackwell's founder, James Mundy, a former chief operating officer at OneUnited Bank in Boston, one of the country's largest minority-owned banks, and a former member of the investment banking group at J.P. Morgan Chase, would not comment because the bank is in the middle of an initial public offering.
 Mainstream banks are also trying to appeal to minority populations. University Bank in Ann Arbor, Mich., for example, started a special service in July 2003 to cater to the area's large Muslim population. The move came after a customer approached Stephen Lange Ranzini, the chief executive of University Bancorp, the parent company, to say that paying and receiving interest violated principles stated in the Koran. ''Educate me,'' he says he responded. 
 As a result of that conversation, University Bank designed leasing agreements that could act as a substitute for traditional loans. Rather than pay interest on a mortgage, for example, Muslims can pay rent on the portion of the home they do not own. And rather than receive interest payments on their savings accounts, they can be paid a profit-sharing dividend on their balances.
 Banks catering to Hispanics are also gaining popularity now, because that population is widely regarded as underserved and its growth promises a lucrative market, said Dan Hudson, president and chief executive of Bankmark in San Luis Obispo, Calif., a provider of consulting services to financial institutions. 
 Mr. Hudson is advising a New York community group led by Elena Sisti, a former Citibank banker, on creating a bank that would focus on Hispanics, with special services like fund transfers to Latin America. 
 Ms. Sisti, however, said the bank would also seek to do business with the majority population, a strategy that Mr. Hudson applauded. ''If you only serve one niche, that makes you vulnerable during an economic downturn,'' he said. ''I refer to niches as more like centers of excellence. The first thing is to be a good community bank.'' 
 That seems to be the prevailing opinion. ''We'll take anybody's money,'' quipped Octavio Hernandez, the founder and president of US Century Bank in Miami, which opened its doors in 2002. While the bank attracts Hispanics and will often offer patrons a cup of Cuban coffee, Mr. Hernandez sees the institution mainly as a community bank with a focus on small and medium-size businesses. ''We saw that there was a vacuum in the market for a home-grown community bank because of all the mergers and acquisitions,'' he said. 
 Today, the bank has expanded to 10 branches. It reported $1 million in profit for its first full year. 
 ''We specialize in old-fashioned banking and know our customers by name,'' Mr. Hernandez said. ''We know their families and we give them a quick response to loan requests.''

HEADLINE: The Buyouts Versus The Holdouts

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
IN a suburb of Buffalo, a developer wants to knock down more than 300 homes to make way for a traditional-style town that he says he believes will alleviate blight. In Norwood, Ohio, three property owners are the lone holdouts against a developer's plan to build shops and parking garages on the site where some of them have lived for more than 30 years. And in Brooklyn, recently converted lofts are in the path of a proposed basketball arena. 
 In the week since the Supreme Court gave cities the right to buy out residences to foster economic development, homeowners across the country have been wondering whether they will be forced out to make way for malls, hotels and even other residences. Historically, eminent domain has applied to civic projects like dams and roads. This ruling more explicitly gives cities the right to knock down houses in favor of private projects. The controversial decision -- allowing New London, Conn., to push ahead with offices, a hotel, new homes and a walkway, generating tax revenue and jobs -- is fueling political and legal battles at the state and local levels. 
Because the decision left states free to restrict government powers to seize homes for economic development, the Institute for Justice, the nonprofit law firm that argued the case in front of the high court on behalf of homeowners in New London, yesterday vowed to take their campaign to state and local courts and legislatures. 
 Local activists are already busy. In Long Branch, N.J., some homeowners are fighting an effort to replace aging beachfront cottages with luxury condos that would start at $550,000. ''It's just un-American,'' said Lori Ann Vendetti, who owns a house there. ''How anyone's property could be taken for someone else's profit is just ludicrous.''
 Not, of course, from the point of view of City Hall, which is confronting a worn beachfront and a need for new tax revenue. ''Governments never look good when elderly people are being told 'You're going to lose your house,''' said Adam Schneider, the mayor of Long Branch. ''But what's a town supposed to do? Are we supposed to just sit there and watch everything fall down and collapse around us and watch a dilapidated area get bigger and bigger every year and do nothing about it?''
 Homeowners argue that ''dilapidated'' may be in the eye of the beholder. ''The mayor keeps calling our area a slum,'' said Ms. Vendetti, who rents out her house across the street from the brick ranch house where she grew up and where her parents, now in their 70's, still live. ''But it's not a slum.'' 
 Denise Hoagland, who owns a three-bedroom house in the neighborhood with her husband, Lee, said that even if the developers, Matzel & Mumford, pay above-market prices for their house, which was assessed for tax purposes two years ago at about $201,000, her family would never be able to afford a new one near the beach.
 Mr. Schneider said the city was working with the developer to help existing homeowners buy into the new project with creative financing like reverse mortgages.
 Ms. Hoagland said she hoped attention generated by the Supreme Court decision would rally other homeowners. ''Maybe people will start doing something about it because they will say, hey, that could affect me,'' she said.
 Under the slogan ''Hands Off My Home,'' the Institute for Justice, which is financed by individuals and foundations, said it was asking governors to sign a pledge to stop governments from taking homes and small businesses for private development. It said it would also push for changes in state constitutions to prohibit such actions. 
 The efforts would ''turn what was a disastrous decision by the Supreme Court into victories for private homeowners and small business owners,'' said Scott G. Bullock, a senior lawyer at the institute.
 This week John Cronyn, a United States senator and Texas Republican, proposed a bill that would prevent the federal government, or any state or local government using federal funds, from condemning homes and small businesses solely for the purpose of promoting economic development. 
 Legislators in states including Georgia, Missouri and Oklahoma, as well as local governments like Westchester County in New York, have said they are considering similar bills. 
 Proponents of the court decision argue that governments need the power to condemn homes and businesses if they are to revitalize cities and prevent sprawl. ''It's one of our most important economic development tools,'' said Charles Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, New York State's economic development authority. Without it, he said, projects like the cleanup of Times Square would not have been possible. 
 For displaced home and business owners, such maneuvers can be devastating. 
 Carl and Joy Gamble, who retired from running a small grocery store four years ago, have fled their home of 35 years in Norwood because they fear eviction by developers of a retail, office and public parking complex.
 ''That was our home and we had plans to just stay there,'' said Mrs. Gamble from her daughter's home in northern Kentucky, where she and her husband are now living. Their belongings are in storage and Mrs. Gamble mourns the loss of peonies and lilies of the valley that she imported from her grandmother's garden to her spacious yard.
 The couple, along with two other property owners, have fought the city's efforts to use eminent domain to force them out of an area it designated as ''deteriorating.'' A county and appellate court ruled against them, though the county court awarded them a price of $280,000 for their house from the developer, which the couple turned down. The Gambles say they are staking their hopes on the Ohio Supreme Court, which issued an injunction in February preventing the developer from tearing down their home. The Institute for Justice is filing an appeal on their behalf with that court next week.
 Their house, meanwhile, is isolated in the middle of an empty plot where about 65 other homeowners sold to the developer. 
 Bill Pierani took an offer of $230,000 for the two-bedroom house where he and his wife, Polly, raised their two sons and lived for 28 years. Mr. Pierani said they were willing to sell partly because an interstate highway had cut through the neighborhood, and the traffic bothered him. 
 With the proceeds they bought a larger house in the town for $162,000. ''It came out real well,'' he said.
 Richard Tranter, a lawyer who represents the developers, said their project would generate $2 million in annual income tax in a city that is running a budget deficit of about the same amount. 
 Arguments of civic good do not move some homeowners. Hank Dowski, who has owned his home in Cheektowaga, a suburb of Buffalo, for 20 years, said a developer's plan to demolish hundreds of houses and apartment buildings in the Cedargrove Heights neighborhood was part of the ''greed that's permeating America.''
 Dominic Piestrak, the developer, wants to build apartments, brownstone town houses, malls and offices. Starting from scratch, he said, would help eliminate crime and abandoned homes. ''If you're going to stop urban blight you have to start somewhere and draw a line in the sand,'' said Mr. Piestrak, who has enlisted the support of the town government. 
 Although Mr. Piestrak said he would offer homeowners 10 to 15 percent above fair market value, some residents said it's not about the money. ''We picked this for our retirement,'' said Barbara Dunn, who with her husband, Stan, moved back to Cheektowaga this year to a house near her parents and sister's family. ''It's a peaceful, nice community and it's justnot a money issue.''
 Pamela Walters, a Cheektowaga homeowner who has lived in Cedargrove Heights for 25 years, said she understands such emotional attachments. But she supports Mr. Piestrak's plan. ''I think something drastic needs to be done there,'' said Mrs. Walters, a pharmacy assistant who lives with her husband, Robert, a tractor-trailer driver. ''It is decaying before our eyes.'' 
 In Brooklyn, residents are fighting a proposal by the developer Forest City Ratner Companies to build a new arena for the Nets along with retail shops, office space, a hotel and 6,000 condo and apartment units. (Forest City Ratner is a partner with The New York Times to build its headquarters near Times Square. As part of that deal, the state has condemned 11 properties that housed some 55 businesses that included sex shops, trade schools and fabric dealers.) 
 Daniel Goldstein, a condo owner in the footprint of the proposed arena and a spokesman for Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, said he believes that favoritism is involved. In the Supreme Court case, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, in a concurring opinion, said that projects could be questioned if favoritism is suspected. 
 James P. Stuckey, an executive vice president at Forest City Ratner, denied any preferential treatment. He said the developer was trying to work with the community by offering to buy out homeowners at or above market rates, adding, ''We would like to not have to condemn anything as part of this project.'' He said 92 percent of the condo and co-op owners who fell within the area designated for the project had already sold their homes to the developer.
 Mr. Goldstein responded that ''the threat of eminent domain, and the limbo that that puts you in until that happens, is frightening and something that nobody wants to live with.'' He added, ''The way to avoid that limbo is to accept a buyout.''
 Vince Bruns, a 53-year-old fishmonger who two years ago bought a loft just steps from the proposed arena site, is one of the holdouts. A sign in his window proclaims: ''I love my home and my neighborhood. I intend to stay here.'' 
 He acknowledged he might someday be forced to sell. ''I'm not going to stop it by myself,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Employees at Village Voice Are Poised for Union Strike

BYLINE: By ABEER ALLAM

 BODY:
With their contract set to expire at midnight tonight, newsroom employees and advertising sales representatives at The Village Voice said yesterday that they were prepared to strike for the first time in the newspaper's 50-year history if they did not get the deal they wanted.
 Negotiations to renew the three-year contract began on June 14. They continued yesterday, but the union said it was not optimistic about reaching an agreement before the deadline. 
When the workers requested a wage increase, the paper's management asked them to pay more for their health insurance coverage, switch to a more limited health plan and adjust how contributions are made to their 401(k) accounts, according to the United Auto Workers, which represents 150 workers at the paper.
 ''We are in very intense negotiations with The Voice,'' said Maida Rosenstein of Local 2110 of the United Auto Workers. ''It is all about the money. They are just trying to pass on all the cost to their workers. They simply want a bigger profit margin.''
 David Schneiderman, the chairman and chief executive of Village Voice Media, the newspaper's parent company, and one of the members of the negotiating team, did not return phone calls or respond to messages left yesterday on his answering machine and with his assistant.
 In a statement, a spokeswoman for The Voice said: ''The Village Voice has a long history of being wholly committed to our staff and our union. The Village Voice management team is working with our union to resolve their issues and negotiate a mutually agreeable contract. We are confident that an amicable settlement can be reached.'' 
 Salaries for entry-level newsroom jobs are under $30,000, the union said. It would not specify the salary increases it was seeking for the paper's reporters, editors, photographers and advertising sales representatives in the union. 
 ''I believe people love the paper, but really require these basic benefit levels to be able to survive,'' Ms. Rosenstein said.
 Workers also asked the management for protections against layoffs. About a dozen workers were laid off in the past few years, the union said.
 ''We want a fair deal,'' said Tom Robbins, a writer who is on the union's negotiating team. ''We are having a very tough time with the demands that management has put on the table for us. Those are demands that we will not accept. Many people here do not earn enough money.''
 The Village Voice, the nation's largest alternative weekly, was one of the first workplaces in the country to offer health insurance to the partners of gay employees. It also extended its health coverage to freelance contributors. Now, the management wants to limit eligibility for health insurance, the union said. 
 One central issue is compensation for writers who contribute to The Voice's Web site, villagevoice.com. While the union demanded restrictions on members' workloads and compensation it considers fair, the management wants to form individual deals with writers, the union said. 
 Joshua B. Freeman, a labor historian and a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, said that as the country has grown more politically conservative in the last 20 years, contract negotiations have become a source of tension between unions and employers.
 ''It is not uncommon to have employers seek to use negotiation to reduce benefit or wages in ways to improve their economic situation,'' Professor Freeman said.

HEADLINE: Helping the Africans, From Left and Right

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Liberals, Conservatives and Aid,'' by David Brooks (column, June 26):
Mr. Brooks makes an important point that we must not discount the role of bad governance, corruption and greed in the misery of millions of Africans. 
 Certainly, the development of peace and democracy on that continent is necessary to raise Africans from poverty. Moreover, these are noble goals worth pursuing for their own end. 
 But as Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist and author of ''The End of Poverty,'' points out in his book, ''well-governed countries in Africa, such as Ghana, Malawi, Mali and Senegal, failed to prosper.'' Without targeted assistance to address specific problems such as tropical disease, climate change and famine, these ''African success stories'' will continue to falter. 
 Mr. Sachs is right to fault the Bush administration for failing to live up to global agreements to increase aid to 0.7 percent of G.D.P. This money is sorely needed on the ground, and without this aid no measure of democracy will bring quinine, bed nets, and antiretrovirals to the millions who need them.

HEADLINE: Carmakers Gain On Reliability

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 29 

 BODY:
Almost every automaker made significant strides in vehicle dependability in a new survey, J.D. Power & Associates said Wednesday. General Motors, Ford and Toyota, the world's three largest automakers, were top performers. 
 The closely watched survey, published since the late 1980's, measures dependability by questioning owners of three-year-old vehicles about problems they are experiencing, like wind noise or excessive brake wear. The survey this year questioned 50,635 owners of 2002 model-year cars and trucks.
 Chance Parker, executive director of product and research analysis at J.D. Power, said the industry showed a 12 percent improvement this year. The industry average was 237 problems per 100 vehicles this year, compared with 269 problems per 100 vehicles in 2004.
 ''Almost every manufacturer got better this year, and we don't always see that,'' he said. ''Manufacturers have already picked all the low-hanging fruit, so now they have to tackle every little thing.''

HEADLINE: Online Dating? Thin and Rich Works Here, Too 

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
ONLINE dating is one of the most popular paid services on the Internet. A 2003 report by comScore Networks stated that 40 million Americans had visited an online dating site, and JupiterResearch reported early this year that industry revenue will reach $516 million in 2005.
 Recently, three economists -- Gunter J. Hitsch, Ali Hortacsu (both from the University of Chicago) and Dan Ariely (from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) -- examined the experiences of a sample of users of a major online dating service and subjected it to empirical scrutiny. Their paper, ''What Makes You Click,'' is available on Mr. Hortacsu's Web page. 
Users who sign up for a dating service typically post a profile describing their age, income and other characteristics along with an optional photo. The researchers asked University of Chicago undergraduates to rate the users' physical attractiveness based on the photos, adding another variable to the mix.
 The online service provided the researchers with information about which sites a user browsed, whether the user sent e-mail to other users or replied to them and whether the user exchanged phone numbers. What happened after that particular milestone was not recorded.
 Start with the self-reported characteristics. There was a strong Lake Wobegon effect in the data, with only 1 percent of the population admitting to having ''less than average'' looks. Even so, only a third actually posted a photo. The reported weights of the women were substantially less than national averages and about 30 percent were blonde. The reported weights of the men were consistent with national averages and only about 12 percent were blond.
 What are people looking for? The most important variable, for both men and women, is looks. Furthermore, posting a photo is a big help: women who post photos receive about twice as many e-mail messages as those who do not, even when they report that they have ''average looks.''
 Having a lot of money is good for attracting e-mail messages, at least for men. Those men reporting incomes in excess of $250,000 received 156 percent more e-mail messages than those with incomes below $50,000. Women like men with a higher income than they have but men do not want to date women who earn more than they do.
 The stated goals for using the service make a big difference in how many e-mail messages are received. Men who are ''hoping to start a long-term relationship'' receive substantially more e-mail than those who are ''just looking/curious.'' The worst thing a man can say is that he is ''seeking a casual relationship,'' receiving 42 percent fewer e-mail messages than he would otherwise. A woman, by contrast, gets 17 percent more e-mail messages by reporting this goal.
 I would guess that none of these findings are terribly surprising. Everyone knows you can't be too rich or too thin.
 But even if preferences are all too predictable, there is still the question of who matches with whom. Consider the case of the 90-year-old bachelor who was asked why he was still single. He replied that he was looking for the perfect woman. 
 ''Never found her, eh,'' the interviewer asked.
 ''Oh, I found her all right,'' said the bachelor, ''but she was looking for the perfect man.''
 In this study ''matching'' is defined as ''exchanging phone numbers.'' The economists' analysis shows that the population tends to exhibit ''assortative matching,'' meaning that people with similar characteristics tend to hook up. Age, income, looks, height, body mass and education are strongly correlated among couples.
 But how well does the online market work in matching people up? Relative to what, one might ask. It turns out that there is a well-known algorithm, the Gale-Shapley algorithm, that can be used to find an ''optimal'' matching of partners.
 The researchers used the initial e-mail inquiries to determine how the men and women ranked each other as potential partners, and then used the Gale-Shapley algorithm to compute a ''stable'' matching of men to women. In this context, a ''stable'' assignment means that there are no two people who would prefer each other to their assigned partner. 
 The researchers found that the outcome of the Gale-Shapley algorithm was very close to what was actually observed. This is consistent with my casual survey of single friends: they claim that online dating is no worse than other ways to meet people. In fact, I know one happily married couple who met via online dating.
 It is perhaps disheartening that superficial attributes like looks, income and hair color are significant determinants of who succeeds in the dating game. But, as the researchers caution, these are the only attributes that are readily observable in the data. As they point out, ''Factors such as personality traits apparently allow us to partly make up for deficiencies in good looks and wealth.'' Whew, that's a relief.

HEADLINE: G.M. Tops List as Study Questions Pension Accounting 

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
General Motors has the nation's biggest corporate pension fund. And the accounting for that fund may represent the biggest illusion among American corporations. 
 It is no secret that pension accounting is a hall of mirrors that distorts the appearance of both pension plans and the companies that sponsor them. But a new analysis of the 500 largest American companies finds that pension accounting allows nearly all of them with pension funds to inflate their net worth. 
 The biggest discrepancy is at G.M.; if the company's balance sheet were adjusted to portray the full magnitude of its pension assets and obligations, the analysis found, its net worth would fall by about $38 billion -- wiping out shareholders' equity. 
 The study ''shows the General without its clothes, and it's not pretty,'' said the author of the new report, Jack T. Ciesielski, publisher of The Analyst's Accounting Observer. 
 To be sure, General Motors and its fund are not in immediate danger. It has made all contributions required under current rules, and the fund had assets of about $100 billion at the end of 2004, far more than it needs to pay benefits coming due at about $7.4 billion a year. 
 But Mr. Ciesielski's report comes as concerns mount about the financial outlook of General Motors, given its competitive pressures and growing health care costs. At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been reviewing the pension accounting of G.M., Ford Motor and several other large companies. When the S.E.C. began its review last fall, an official said the agency had not found violations of the securities laws by G.M. or the other companies, but wanted to see whether their pension calculations were connected with efforts to ''smooth'' earnings.
 A G.M. spokesman said that while Mr. Ciesielski's analysis ''might be a topic for some type of theoretical debate,'' G.M. was abiding by the accounting rules now in place and considered them appropriate. 
 ''This is a complicated accounting issue, and the average investor has to do a little bit of homework,'' said the spokesman, Jerry Dubrowski. ''Our disclosures are comprehensive, and the reason that he's able to provide so much information in his analysis is because of our disclosures.''
 Mr. Ciesielski, a member of the Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, also adjusted the balance sheets of the 500 largest American companies that run pension funds. Virtually all reported an inflated value for their shareholders' equity as a result of their pension accounting, he contended. But G.M. had by far the biggest discrepancy, or ''equity gap,'' as Mr. Ciesielski calls it. 
 In its annual report, G.M. reported a net worth, or shareholders' equity, of $27.7 billion at the end of 2004. But that figure includes several pension-related items that are little better than ''accounting placeholders,'' Mr. Ciesielski said, numbers that poorly reflect the actual size of G.M.'s obligations to its pensioners and the investments it has made to secure them. 
 General Motors did nothing unusual or improper in using these numbers; it simply followed standard pension accounting rules. When Mr. Ciesielski removed these numbers and replaced them with figures that he believes more closely correspond to economic reality, G.M. ended up with a negative shareholders' equity of $10 billion--a $38 billion swing from the reported amount. 
 ''Negative shareholders' equity is not a death sentence,'' Mr. Ciesielski said in an interview, explaining that he was not trying to predict whether G.M. might one day go bankrupt or default on its pension obligations. Rather, he said, his study showed just how much the current accounting rules for pensions can obscure a company's true financial condition. 
 ''I think what I showed on the revised balance sheet makes a lot more sense,'' he said. His version clarified the values of G.M.'s assets, the sizes and ranking of the various creditors' claims on them -- including the claims of pensioners -- and what was left over as shareholders' equity. He also suggested putting the refined pension values on a separate, supplementary balance sheet, rather than tucking them away in a footnote. The current practice ''blurs everything for the investor,'' he said.
 Ronald J. Ryan, founder of Ryan ALM, a consulting firm, said of G.M., ''They followed the rules.''
 ''That's why the S.E.C. is, for the most part, going to come up empty-handed'' in its inquiry, he said. ''It's the rules that are wrong.''
 Another big equity gap, of $22 billion, was at I.B.M., where shareholders' equity fell from a reported $30 billion to $8 billion in Mr. Ciesielski's analysis. At Ford Motor, shareholders' equity fell from the reported $16 billion to $4.7 billion. 
 G.M. was not the only company to end up with a net worth of less than zero in Mr. Ciesielski's analysis. So did Boeing, Goodyear and UST. Lucent Technologies, Delta Air Lines, Maytag and Qwest had negative shareholders' equity even before Mr. Ciesielski did his adjustments, and at those companies his revisions made that condition worse.
 Even the net worth of a corporate stalwart, General Electric, was inflated by $10 billion through pension accounting, Mr. Ciesielski found. It fell from $110.3 billion to $100.8 billion once he removed the accounting placeholders from its balance sheet and replaced them with market values for G.E.'s pension fund. 
 The accounting rules for company pensions have no direct connection with the pension-funding rules, which are now being scrutinized by Congress in light of the huge pension failure at United Airlines.
 As it happens, G.M. has complied energetically with the funding rules, even taking the unusual step in 2003 of issuing $18 billion worth of bonds and putting the proceeds into its pension fund. In its annual report and other public documents, the company states that its pension plan is fully funded under the funding rules, and that it expects not to owe any more pension contributions until 2010.
 The way the accounting for pensions now works, most of the routine ups and downs of a pension fund are kept off the sponsoring company's balance sheet. Instead, they are kept in running tabs that are expected to net each other out over the long term. The argument for doing things this way is that a pension fund is a long-term entity and its year-to-year fluctuations may not be meaningful information for investors. 
 Mr. Dubrowski, the G.M. spokesman, said that confronting an investor with the volatility of a pension fund would be like showing a 401(k) plan participant his mutual fund balance every day. ''You have to think about it on a long-term basis,'' he said.
 The trouble is, the big fluctuations of the last few years have not all canceled one another out, and the accumulations are growing very large. When they reach a certain point, companies are supposed to start slicing off a bit every year and counting it as part of that year's labor costs. That can reduce corporate earnings, sometimes for years. 
 This month, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which writes the accounting rules for American business, began preliminary work on a complete revision of the current pension accounting procedures.

 CORRECTION:
The Market Place column in Business Day on Thursday, about the accounting for General Motors' pension fund, misstated the business of Ryan ALM Inc., a company founded by Ronald J. Ryan. It is a money management firm specializing in matching assets and liabilities, not a consulting firm.

GRAPHIC: Chart: ''Understanding the Numbers Behind the Numbers''General Motors' pension fund has assets of about $100 billion and obligations of about $107 billion, but it is impossible to see that by sifting through the corporate balance sheet because accounting procedures blur the numbers.

HEADLINE: MOOD OF ANXIETY ENGULFS AFGHANS AS VIOLENCE RISES

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, June 29 

 BODY:
The loss of a military helicopter with 17 Americans aboard in eastern Afghanistan on Tuesday comes at a time of growing insecurity here. For the first time since the United States overthrew the Taliban government three and a half years ago, Afghans say they are feeling uneasy about the future. 
 Violence has increased sharply in recent months, with a resurgent Taliban movement mounting daily attacks in southern Afghanistan, gangs kidnapping foreigners here in the capital and radical Islamists orchestrating violent demonstrations against the government and foreign-financed organizations. 
 The steady stream of violence has dealt a new blow to this still traumatized nation of 25 million. In dozens of interviews conducted in recent weeks around the country, Afghans voiced concern that things were not improving, and that the Taliban and other dangerous players were gaining strength. 
 An American Chinook helicopter that crashed on Tuesday was brought down by hostile fire as it was landing during combat in a mountainous border area, American military officials said Wednesday. [Page A14.] 
 Afghans interviewed about the continuing violence also expressed increased dissatisfaction with their own government and the way the United States military was conducting its operations, and said they were suspicious of the Americans' long-term intentions. 
 ''Three years on, the people are still hoping that things are going to work out, but they have become suspicious about why the Americans came, and why the Americans are treating the local people badly,'' said Jandad Spinghar, leader of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission in Nangarhar Province in the east, just across the Khyber Pass from Pakistan. 
 Poverty, joblessness, frustrated expectations and the culture of 25 years of war make for a volatile mix in which American military raids, shootings and imprisonments can inflame public opinion, many here say.
 ''Generally people are not against the Americans,'' Mr. Spinghar said. ''But in areas where there are no human rights, where they do not have good relations and where there is bad treatment of villagers or prisoners, this will hand a free area to the Taliban. It's very important that the Americans understand how the Afghan people feel.'' 
 Reflecting the shifting popular mood, President Hamid Karzai has publicly criticized the behavior of American troops and called for closer cooperation when Afghan homes are raided. 
 The Taliban's spring offensive has sounded an alarm for the United States military and the Karzai government, both of which had said that the Taliban were largely defeated and that the nation was consolidating behind its first elected national leader.
 ''We were wrong,'' a senior Afghan government official acknowledged, saying of the Taliban, ''It seems they were spending the time preparing.'' He insisted on anonymity because of the delicacy of the subject within the government. 
 While the government blames the Taliban -- and its backers in Pakistan and Al Qaeda -- for the violence, the American military is frequently blamed by Afghans for drawing radical Islamic fighters to the country and then failing to control them. 
 ''The Americans are the cause of the insecurity,'' said Abdullah Mahmud, 26, a law student in Kabul. ''If they were not here, there would not be any insecurity. The money they are spending on military expenses -- if they spent half of it on the Afghan Army and police and raised their skills, then there would not be any security questions.'' 
 Opponents of the government are calling for foreign troops and international aid organizations to leave Afghanistan, a call that has resonated with Afghans' spirit of independence. The government, though, is anxiously seeking assurances that the foreign troops and assistance will stay and help it through this latest wave of adversity.
 During the anti-American protests that followed allegations that guards at Guantanamo Bay had desecrated the Koran, Kabul's students demonstrated against the establishment of permanent United States military bases in Afghanistan, said Muhammad Mir Jan, 25, a literature student. ''Students support the current presence of troops because we need them now,'' he said, ''but not a permanent presence.'' 
 An unemployed man sitting in a corner shop in Jalalabad with a group of friends said of the Americans, ''They should go.'' But others demurred.
 ''No, I think the Americans should be here, because if they are not, the warlords would come back again and the poor people would not be able to survive in this country,'' said Samiullah, 27, who said he was applying for a job as a driver with a foreign group. 
 Abdul Zaher, 26, the owner of the shop, said, ''They should not leave our country until they have rebuilt it.'' 
 Sayed Asadullah Hashimi, an assistant professor at Kabul University's School of Islamic Law, said, ''Outside Kabul, two-thirds of the people think that the Americans came only to invade and occupy Afghanistan, and that is why day by day the tension is growing. The mood is worsening.'' 
 With parliamentary elections approaching in September, the issue of the American military presence is already emerging at the forefront of political debate. Foreign diplomats are forecasting that the election will deliver a Parliament divided on ethnic lines and largely anti-Karzai, with a strong element of jihadi leaders and Islamists. 
 President Karzai will have to change his cabinet, now largely made up of technocrats, to reflect the makeup of Parliament, said one diplomat, who asked not to be identified because of the political nature of his comments.
 The current instability does not yet add up to a national uprising. The Taliban movement remains restricted to a narrow core of believers and a larger number who are motivated by money more than anything else, Afghan and foreign officials said. But they warned that it would be dangerous to ignore the signs of unrest. 
 Changes have often come suddenly in Afghanistan's turbulent history, frequently catching outsiders by surprise: the slaughter in the Khyber Pass of retreating British forces in the 19th century; the kidnapping and killing of the American ambassador in 1979; and the Russian debacle after 10 years of brutal occupation in the 1980's. 
 The airlift of foreign aid workers from Jalalabad after a day of rioting last month raised the specter of the Afghans turning against foreigners once more.
 Afghans interviewed this week frequently warned that if the American forces did not show greater care, especially in their treatment of detainees and their families, the people could turn against them. ''They should respect our culture and our religion and they will be successful,'' said Lal Muhammad, the senior partner of a real estate firm in the southern city of Kandahar. 
 His partner, Taher Shah, said the United States should not overestimate the extent of its own power. ''The Americans are very powerful and they can control the government,'' he said. ''But if the people don't like them, they will have to leave.'' 
 Foreign officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the issue, said much of the public disillusionment and frustration was traceable to a lack of governance -- from the simple absence of government, to the failure to administer the law properly, to the corruption of the local police and the courts. 
 ''Since 2002,'' one of the officials said, ''we have been issuing warnings that the main threat was the failure to address profound governance problems, and if we did not take it seriously, grievances would start to stem from that.''

HEADLINE: North Korean Diplomat to Meet With U.S. Officials and Their Allies

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29 

 BODY:
A senior North Korean official, in New York to attend a private foreign policy conference, will meet Thursday with representatives of the United States, Japan and South Korea, senior Bush administration officials and foreign diplomats said Wednesday. They said they would press him to explain whether North Korea planned to return to nuclear disarmament talks. 
 More than a year has passed since North Korea walked away from the talks. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is planning to take a new approach with the Chinese when she travels to Beijing next month. Instead of urging them to press North Korea to return to the talks, as she has until now, Ms. Rice will instead ask the Chinese to explain what additional punitive steps against North Korea they may be willing to accept, said the diplomats and officials, who are not authorized by their governments to discuss the issue publicly. 
 Almost every action contemplated -- sanctions, embargoes, naval blockades -- requires cooperation from China to be effective. Thus far, China has expressed opposition to any new steps and has instead counseled patience.
 The officials and diplomats acknowledged that China was most likely to urge Ms. Rice to offer North Korea more incentives -- something the White House has said it will not do. That would leave the North Korea nuclear problem ''unresolved for a long time,'' one senior diplomat said.
 Earlier this month, South Korea said a senior minister had met with Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader, who told him that North Korea planned to return to the talks in July. But North Korea has not set a date. 
 Also, the State Department said it had agreed to grant a visa to Li Gun, director general of the North Korean Foreign Ministry's North America department, so he could attend a private conference on North Korea organized by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy on Thursday. But the department would not say whether any meetings were planned.
 Joseph E. DeTrani, a special envoy dealing with the North Korean talks, is also attending the conference, and on Wednesday the officials and diplomats said he would talk with Mr. Li, along with representatives from Japan and South Korea. 
 Mr. DeTrani has met in New York with a lower-level North Korean official at the United Nations five times in the last 10 months. 
 On June 14, Christopher Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the United States was growing ever more doubtful that North Korea would be willing to give up its nuclear arms. 
 But then on June 17, Chung Dong Young, South Korea's minister of unification, reported on Mr. Kim's statement that North Korea would return to the talks, giving new hope.
 ''I think it is quite likely they will return to the talks,'' James A. Kelly, who was assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs until early this year, said Monday. He had just returned from South Korea. 
 ''Some of the remarks made to Chung were very positive,'' he added.
 One senior diplomat noted that when Mr. Kim made a public remark, ''it is very calculated.''
 ''So everyone's expectation is that they will come back to the talks.''
 But given the many disappointments and frustrations the talks have produced over the last two years, American officials and their Japanese and South Korean allies decided that the best approach now would be to ask the Chinese what new actions they might be willing to accept.

HEADLINE: Iran's New President

 BODY:
Presidential elections in Iran defy easy categorization. The winner assumes Iran's highest elective office, but no president to date has been able to defy the wishes of the unelected ayatollahs who rule the country. And while the nomination process is very tightly controlled, the eventual winner often comes as a surprise to many Iranians and most outsiders. 
 That pattern repeated itself with the landslide victory of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad last week. A radically conservative mayor of Tehran and former member of the thuggish Basij militia, Mr. Ahmadinejad little resembles the departing president, Mohammad Khatami, a reformist intellectual. But like Mr. Khatami in his initial upset victory eight years ago, Mr. Ahmadinejad dethroned a better-known establishment candidate, in this case a former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
Mr. Rafsanjani lost because he was too closely associated with the recent economic failures and political inertia. Mr. Ahmadinejad, in contrast, offered a populist economic platform that implicitly challenged the cronyism and corruption of more than a quarter-century of clerical rule. We wish him luck. But it is hard to see how he can deliver on those promises over the objections of the ruling establishment, whose powers greatly exceed his own. 
 On the issue of greatest current concern to the United States, Iran's steady progress toward the ability to produce nuclear bomb fuel, Mr. Ahmadinejad's victory is expected to lead to greater intransigence and less interest in compromise. Any acceptable deal would have to include an Iranian commitment to halt efforts to enrich uranium or separate plutonium, which can produce nuclear bomb fuel. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's initial statements on this issue have been ambiguous, favoring continued pursuit of nuclear technology and continued diplomacy. Perhaps, a fiery nationalist like Mr. Ahmadinejad may be just the right man to cut a nuclear deal, just as it took Richard Nixon to reach out to Communist China. But we doubt it; the greater trade and investment that a deal would bring may not mean much to a politician whose greatest political appeal has come from promising a return to the austere, self-reliant ideology of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. 
 Unless the long-stalled talks with Britain, France and Germany make some real progress in the very near future, these European powers should acknowledge that diplomacy has failed and refer the Iranian nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council. That will not necessarily produce a solution either, particularly if Beijing uses its veto to shelter Iran, an important oil supplier. But there is no point prolonging negotiations if Iran intends only to use them to buy time to further advance its nuclear weapons ambitions.

HEADLINE: Trade Pacts To the South Losing Appeal

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, June 29 

 BODY:
An ambitious American plan for a hemispherewide trade pact, which President Bush described as a ''vital link for prosperity,'' is mired in disputes that have led to widespread skepticism about its chances of ever materializing. 
 With big nations like Brazil and Argentina firmly opposed to the plan, the United States has redirected its efforts in the last two years from creating a trade bloc spanning 34 nations to instead negotiating with a handful of smaller, more compliant countries in Central America and the Andes.
But a deal for Central America is facing a bruising battle in Congress and, if approved, may be watered down by concessions to American sugar growers worried about cheap imports. The Bush administration won a victory Wednesday when the Senate Finance Committee approved the proposed Central American Free Trade Agreement.
 Supporters of Cafta, as the pact is known, predicted the Senate could pass the measure without great difficulty Thursday night or Friday, but the pact is likely to face tough resistance in the House, where numerous Republicans from states that produce sugar and textiles have threatened to vote against it. 
 Looking farther south, the Andean nations of Bolivia and Ecuador, rocked by tumult, have little latitude to sign a trade deal anytime soon. Even Peru and Colombia, both close to the United States, are hesitating because of concerns that their farming sectors will be swamped by cheap, subsidized American imports.
 After more than four years of talks, the Bush administration's grand initiative for Latin America has signed up one country, Chile.
 ''The free trade agenda is in very serious trouble in Latin America,'' said Michael Shifter, a vice president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy study group in Washington.
 Prospects were much brighter soon after Mr. Bush was elected. Latin America was then declared a priority, and the administration began drumming up support for a tariff-free $3.4 trillion trade bloc stretching from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, comprising 823 million people.
 ''Democratic freedoms cannot flourish unless our hemisphere also builds a prosperity whose benefits are widely shared,'' Mr. Bush told the Organization of American States in April 2001. ''Open trade is an essential foundation for that prosperity and that possibility.''
 But increasingly, Latin Americans view free trade with the United States with suspicion, as the region has in recent years shifted to the left and become increasingly wary of Washington's economic prescriptions as growth flagged and promises of prosperity were perceived as increasingly hollow.
 The reasons for the caution are numerous, from a potent antiglobalization movement that has swept South America, to practical concerns in countries as varied as Brazil and Honduras about what opening markets to the United States, the world's biggest economy, could mean to home-grown industries.
 Ideology has played a role, with Washington's leading antagonist in the region, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, calling the Bush administration's free trade agenda ''the medicine of death.'' 
 Riordan Roett, director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins University, said there was more than just a backlash against market reforms and the perceived trade agenda of the United States. ''It's almost a wholesale rejection of what people believe they were fed by the folks in Washington,'' he said.
 Already in recent months, two governments the United States hoped would sign free trade deals have collapsed in the wake of protests with a strong antiglobalization component.
 In April, Ecuador's president, Lucio Gutierrez, who had close economic relations with the United States, was forced out. Then, on June 9, Bolivia's Congress accepted President Carlos Mesa's resignation, appointing a new president, Eduardo Rodriguez, who nevertheless faces the threat of more protests.
 ''How could Bolivia enter talks now?'' said Pablo Solon, who leads a policy group, Fundacion Solon, in La Paz that is opposed to American-led talks. ''It would be like throwing more fuel on the fire.''
 American officials have not given up, saying most countries in the region see better times ahead by signing trade deals with Washington. The American focus, for the time being, is to secure a trade pact with five Central American countries and the Dominican Republic, to set the stage for talks with other countries.
 ''This trade agreement benefits both sides,'' Mr. Bush told a group of Central American ambassadors in Washington last Thursday. ''Cafta presents us with a free and fair trading system.''
 But the pact, representing $33 billion in trade, is strongly opposed by Democrats worried about weak labor and environmental protections. Cafta might still be approved, but political analysts and Congressional aides said approval may require side deals to sugar producers to reduce the blow from the trade agreement. 
 The favorable vote in the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday came after White House reached an agreement with an important Democrat, Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, under which the Bush administration pledged to spend more money on projects to strengthen enforcement of labor and environmental laws in the Central American nations as part of the trade agreement.
 The House Ways and Means Committee is expected to pass the trade bill on Thursday, but House leaders do not plan a vote on the floor until after the Fourth of July holiday. Defeat is also possible, in part because of Republicans like Walter B. Jones Jr., who worries about job losses in his home state, North Carolina.
 ''Nafta has been a disaster for the workers of North Carolina,'' Mr. Jones said in a phone interview, speaking of the 12-year-old trade agreement the United States has with Mexico and Canada. ''I just see Cafta as an extension of Nafta, in terms of jobs being lost by the citizens of my state. I'm just not even sure this treaty would be good for the countries of Central America.''
 The pact with Central America would represent a tiny fraction of American trade, which reached $2.3 trillion last year. But it would have great symbolic weight in Latin America.
 ''If Cafta fails, it's going to be very hard to move on F.T.A.,'' Regina K. Vargo, the chief American trade negotiator in Latin America, said in an interview, referring to a larger free trade agreement for the Americas.
 American talks with the nations of the Andes, which started in May 2004, are meeting obstacles. In Colombia, whose $89 billion economy dwarfs others in the region, an influential agricultural sector has lobbied against a free trade deal. Stopping tariffs on American imports while the United States maintains subsidies to its farmers would destroy Colombian agriculture, they say. 
 ''The United States does not want to understand that it takes two countries to negotiate,'' said Rafael Mejia, president of the powerful Society of Growers. ''They make maximum demands, but when we have made demands, they have not responded.''
 In Bolivia, the authorities worry about small but healthy industries like the country's pharmaceutical sector, made up of 16 companies that employ 1,800 workers and generate revenues of $55 million a year. 
 At Inti Pharmaceuticals, a 69-year-old company, workers produce a range of 400 products. But a free trade deal would extend patent protections on old American products, in effect phasing out the generic brands that Inti makes, Gonzalo Munoz, who manages the plant, said. 
 ''The impact would not be immediate,'' said Erika Duenas, manager of the Bolivian Pharmaceutical Industry Chamber. ''But in the long term, it would mean the closing of our companies.''

HEADLINE: The Silver Lining in Iran

BYLINE: By Abbas Milani. 
Abbas Milani is director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford and co-director of the Iran Democracy Project at the Hoover Institution.

DATELINE: Stanford, Calif. 

 BODY:
THE hottest book in Iran these days is Bill Clinton's ''My Life.'' There are three unauthorized translations on the market and at least two more on the way, Iranian newspapers report. By all accounts, a George W. Bush memoir might do just as well. And that is only the most recent indication of the overwhelmingly favorable disposition of the Iranian population toward the United States. 
 The same newspapers that reported the Clinton book sales last weekend also covered, with much fanfare, President-elect Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's defiant attitude toward the United States at his first press conference, on Sunday. Mr. Ahmadinejad stepped on a painting of the American flag as he went to vote. He dismissed the idea that Iran needed to build any relationship with the United States and vowed to continue Iran's nuclear program, which Washington opposes. As for the haughty Europeans, Mr. Ahmadinejad proclaimed, they must leave their ivory towers and speak to the Iranians as equals. 
In fact, it is Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and a cabal of conservative mullahs and Revolutionary Guards who have absconded to ivory towers with their dogma and greed for power. Ignoring serious signs of crisis, they masterminded Mr. Ahmadinejad's victory. According to three of Mr. Ahmadinejad's opponents, members of the Revolutionary Guards and the basij militia, who together number in the millions, were told whom to vote for and to bring up to 10 family members along with them to the polls. The same sources allege that millions of dollars from public coffers were distributed among militia members in order to bring out the hard-line vote. 
 Nevertheless, contrary to the common perception, this election is not so much a sign of the Iranian system's strength as of its weakness. Last week's presidential election is only the most recent example of the tactical wisdom and strategic foolishness of Iran's ruling mullahs. All the reformist candidates, particularly Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, as well as the approximately 70 percent of the electorate who voted for reformists or boycotted the election, sought above all to limit Ayatollah Khamenei's increasing despotism. Rather than accepting this possible outcome, Ayatollah Khamenei and his allies made a grab for absolute power. In the process they may have unwittingly opened the door for democracy -- because their hardball tactics have created the most serious rift in the ranks of ruling mullahs since the inception of the Islamic Republic. The experience of emerging democracies elsewhere has shown that dissension within ruling circles has often presaged the fall of authoritarianism. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's presidency will force a crisis not only in Iran's political establishment but also, and even more important, in its economy. Only a huge infusion of capital and expertise, along with open markets, can even begin to address the country's economic problems, which include high unemployment, a rapidly increasing labor force, cronyism and endemic corruption. 
 Such an infusion requires, more than anything, security and the rule of law. It requires a fairly elected president who inspires the confidence of investors and governments around the world. Instead, through a dubious election, Iran's kingmakers propelled a man into the presidency who has publicly opined that the stock market is a form of gambling with no place in a genuine Islamic society. 
 Not surprisingly, Mr. Ahmadinejad's election brought about the single greatest plunge in the Iranian stock market's history. The day is already known as Black Saturday, and the president-elect has been scrambling to undo the damage since. Indeed, Mr. Ahmadinejad hastened to promise that he would not shut the stock market, and the intelligence agencies set about ''proving'' that rumors of the market's closing were a conspiracy of the enemies of the state. 
 Instead of finding a sound strategic solution to Iran's economic woes, Ayatollah Khamenei and his allies have trotted out the old populist slogans of revolutionary justice, economic autarky and pseudosocialism. When that formula fails, as it did in the 1980's even with the charisma of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to help it along, the mullahs will be denied their last bastion of support among the country's poor, whose piety and deprivation they have long exploited. In the short term, the right wing has scored a major victory. In the long run, they have helped bring Iran one step closer to democracy.
