HEADLINE: Profit Falls 28% at Nokia; Slower Sales Are Forecast 

BYLINE:  By HEATHER TIMMONS 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 17 

 BODY:
Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer, reported a drop in second-quarter profits today and said that revenue could fall further in the third quarter.
 The company, based in Espoo, Finland, said that weakness in the dollar and the economy was to blame for a 28 percent drop in net profit, to 624 million euros ($718 million). Earnings per share fell to 0.13 euro. 
 Jorma Ollila, Nokia's chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call that "adverse currency movements" had cut into profits. Lower consumer confidence in some countries in Europe, and the threat of SARS also slowed sales of high-end phones, he said.
Although the number of phones sold is expected to increase "well over 10 percent" in the third quarter, Mr. Ollila said, the value of those sales would be flat to slightly down, largely because of the decline of the dollar.
Profits at Nokia and other phone makers are being squeezed as the market for high-end phones becomes saturated, while demand grows for cheap phones in new markets. Unit sales were up 14 percent in the second quarter from a year ago, Nokia reported, but in value, sales were up 1 percent, to 7.02 billion euros from the period a year earlier. Nokia's results included a 399 million euro charge for job cuts at the company's wireless network unit.
Sales of new products and expensive items like phones with cameras andcolor screens, meanwhile, have been stifled by the economy.
"The European economy today is dead," Mr. Ollila said. "There is no growth and consumer confidence is low."
The net profit drop was expected, as the company warned investors in June that earnings would be lower. But analysts said that there were other negative surprises in Nokia's results.
"Revenue and earnings per share figures may be in line with consensus," Adnaan Ahmad, a Merrill Lynch analyst wrote in a report, "but the numbers in between, from our point of view, show a disappointing set of results."
Mr. Ahmad pointed to Nokia's falling average sales price, an industry barometer that tracks the price of each handset a company sells. At Nokia, that price was 135 euros, compared with Mr. Ahmad's estimate of 141 euros. Handset operating margins, or profits on each phone, were 23.1 percent, again lower than his 24.1 percent estimate.
Competition has increased, with manufacturers from Japan, China and the United States introducing new phones. Telephone companies that offer mobile service, Mr. Ahmad said, "could have exerted pressure on Nokia's pricing."
The company said that its third-quarter earnings would be in the range of 0.15 to 0.17 euro a share. This is below a market forecast of 0.20 euro a share. Mr. Ollila also said that he expected Nokia's wireless network business for 2004 would be "flattish" from 2003, an improvement from the company's previous projections.
On a positive note, the company, which makes two of every five mobile phones in the world, said its market share was growing, particularly in the United States and Latin America. Despite the tepid outlook for the current quarter, analysts said they approved of Nokia's overall business plan.
As competition increases among mobile phone makers, "The question is 'How many of these companies can be profitable in the long term?' " said Chris Versace, an analyst at Friedman, Billings Ramsey & Company.
"In the long term, Nokia remains well-positioned."

HEADLINE: Russia Says It Won't Seek Origins of Elite's Wealth 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 17 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov sought to calm anxiety in his country's business community today by publicly stating that Russia would not review the origins of the fortunes made in its much-questioned privatization program.
 Mr. Kasyanov is the first senior official to publicly address the issue of whether the Kremlin will seek to wrest the fortunes from rich Russians who made their money in a lawless program of state-asset sales in the mid-1990's. 
 Fear of property repatriation has consumed the Russian elite for the last two weeks since the arrest of an ally of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, a powerful tycoon, on charges that he violated a 1994 privatization contract. 
"The results of the previous years' privatizations are unshakable," said Mr. Kasyanov, opening a weekly government meeting in Moscow.
People and companies affiliated with Mr. Khodorkovsky have been the targets of a flurry of criminal investigations in the last two weeks, since his associate, Platon Lebedev, was taken away in handcuffs, charged with not making the required investment in a fertilizer company he bought from the state nine years ago. The authorities have begun at least four other criminal investigations into people and companies in Mr. Khodorkovsky's circle.
The investigations have frightened the business community for two reasons. First, much of Russia's current economic revival was born of its corrupt privatization program of the mid-1990's, and the government could accuse any number of businessmen of past violations and probably even be right. 
But perhaps more important is the implicit message on property rights. The legal system is perceived as being too malleable by wealth or power to adequately protect property. Instead, entrepreneurs rely on personal connections to government bureaucrats for protection. This practice hurts business, as entrepreneurs never feel secure about what they own.
"The topic of privatization in Russia needs to be forgotten," said Boris E. Nemtsov, parliamentary leader of a political party, the Union of Right Forces. "If we start to dig into this, it will lead to capital flight, emigration and destruction."
Investors are also shaken. Russia's stock market has plunged 15 percent over the past two weeks, with today's statements failing to stem the drop. Share prices are at their lowest point since May. Yukos Oil, Mr. Khodorkovsky's company, has lost $7 billion in market capitalization as its stock has lost about a fifth of its value.
Mr. Khodorkovsky, 40, who until recently had been publicly reserved on the matter, earlier this week warned that the attacks on his company would damage Russia's economy. Mr. Khodorkovsky spent the weekend with international businessmen like Bill Gates at an exclusive conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.
Political writers say Mr. Khodorkovsky incurred the wrath of a small group of career bureaucrats in the entourage of President Vladimir V. Putin. The tycoon's attempts to gain support in Parliament by donating to parties opposed to Mr. Putin was intolerable to the officials, many of whom came from jobs in the intelligence and security services.
"It's a clash between a couple of greedy and stealing officials who happen to be Mr. Putin's close friends, and one of Russia's most transparent companies," said Yulia Latynina, a novelist and journalist. "Mr. Putin has to choose."
The tycoons themselves say privately that Mr. Putin himself sanctioned the raids on companies close to Mr. Khodorkovsky.
Mr. Putin's public statements on the matter have been ambiguous. In a newspaper report, Arkady Volsky, the head of the businessmen's lobbying organization, the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, said he was told by Mr. Putin that the president does not deal with matters like the raids on Mr. Khodorkovsky's companies.
Fresh problems surfaced for Yukos tonight. A deputy in Parliament requested that the general prosecutor's office investigate the privatization of a company called Rospan, now affiliated with Yukos.
But despite the dark clouds, few observers expect Russia to reopen the closed chapter of privatization more broadly. 
"To visualize the beginnings of a giant rollback is one thing that you can cross off the list," said Thane Gustafson, senior director for Eurasian energy at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, based in Cambridge, Mass.

HEADLINE: Allure of Europe Is Drawing Students 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, July 15 

 BODY:
When Newton Campos returned home to Brazil in March with a new job, to recruit M.B.A. applicants for his alma mater, the Spanish business school Instituto de Empresa, his bosses were not expecting him to enroll any students in his first year.
 "They warned me that the first and even the second year can be tough for new representative offices," said Mr. Campos, 27, the business school's first recruiter in Brazil. 
 But after he spent four months visiting the top 100 companies in Brazil and promoting the school, nearly 500 would-be applicants had contacted the school's office here, five people had applied to and had been accepted, and Mr. Campos's bosses in Madrid were so happy, he said, "they were dancing the samba." 
Though Mr. Campos undoubtedly deserves the kudos his bosses showered on him, the Brazilian interest in the school also underscores a trend that, if it continues, could prove worrisome for all but the most elite business schools in the United States.
Over the past two years, more and more Brazilians -- and other Latin Americans, I.E. representatives say -- have been choosing to pursue their master's degrees in business administration in Europe rather than in the United States, attracted by shorter programs, lower costs and the greater cultural diversity they say they think the Old World offers.
Many also fear that they could face difficulties in a country that seems to have become more closed and mistrustful of foreigners since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Some Brazilians are now choosing newly created M.B.A. programs at local universities, but many aspiring global executives who can afford it still prefer to study abroad.
Fabio Armani, senior associate at MBA Empresarial, a Sao Paulo M.B.A. consulting firm that helps people choose and apply to schools, said that of his 100 clients last year, 60 applied only to American schools, 30 to European and American schools and 10 only to European schools. Two years earlier, 80 percent of a similar number of applicants wanted to study in the United States, 15 percent applied on both sides of the Atlantic, and 5 percent applied only in Europe.
Claudia Goncalves, director of English Consulting, another M.B.A. specialist, said that 61 percent of her firm's clients applied to American schools last year, compared with 92 percent in 1999.
Both cite the mostly one-year M.B.A. programs offered in Europe, which cost students about two-thirds of the approximately $100,000 in tuition for a two-year master's degree at Harvard, Stanford or the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. They also say students are eager to live in Europe, where several capital cities and their different cultures are often just a few hours' drive apart.
"Here we already live the American way of life quite a lot," Mr. Armani said. "We already eat a lot of burgers. European culture and living over there can be very attractive for some Brazilians."
At the most international of American business schools, like the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, typically about 35 percent of the students are foreign, while the average in most European business schools is about 70 percent, Ms. Goncalves said. At Insead, the elite business school near Paris, only 8 percent of students are French.
Demand for top American schools is still solid, Mr. Armani said, but an increasing number of applicants are attracted by the more global approach many European schools offer.
For Instituto de Empresa, that means a big opportunity in places like Brazil and the rest of Latin America.
After decades of economic isolation, Brazil is opening up to the world and especially to its Spanish-speaking neighbors. The bilingual courses in English and Spanish at Instituto de Empresa are a big plus for Brazilians, who are increasingly eager to learn the language of those neighboring countries. Mr. Campos expects to be recruiting 20 to 30 compatriots a year within two years.
So far, top schools in the United States say they are not hurting. And Brazil is still one of the most important sources of foreign students, along with China, India, Mexico and South Korea. But Rod Garcia, director of admissions for the master's program in business at M.I.T., acknowledged the stiffer European competition.
"Spain still looks toward Latin America as family," he said. "It's much easier for them to convince a Chilean or an Argentine to go to Spain rather than to Harvard or Wharton."
Rather than Latin America looking more toward Europe, Mr. Garcia said, "I think it's more of a case of European business schools being much more aggressive in Latin America than in the past."
That may be, but there are many Latin Americans -- even among the staunchest believers in free-market economics -- who think the United States has become a less open, less friendly place.
"U.S. business philosophy seems to be closing in on itself -- it always has to be their model, their way of doing things," said a 28-year-old consultant with a top American auditor in Sao Paulo, who has applied for an M.B.A. at the Universidade Catolica Portuguesa in Lisbon, but has not yet told her employers. "I think the people I meet in Europe will be more cosmopolitan," she said, "and I think that will reflect in the course."
Some applicants also say that with Brazil and Argentina now both under left-leaning governments that want to bolster industry, European courses that traditionally have closer links with industry rather than with finance might be more useful.
That, said Filipe Salgado, 25, who has worked at Citibank in Sao Paulo for six years, is why he is applying to three European business schools. "If I want to get into industry afterward," he said, "I think maybe I will fit in better with a European M.B.A."
Others say American schools, perhaps because they invented the M.B.A., are simply too important to pass up.
"Harvard is a brilliant brand name whether you're in Alaska or China," said Emiliano Machado, 27, who is applying to Harvard and Insead, and plans to return to Brazil after he gets his degree to take over his family's construction firm.
Nicolas Scafuro, 28, the owner of an online entertainment and advertising agency, applied to M.I.T. because it"is top in technology and for training leaders of new ventures, and my market, the Internet, is much more linked to the U.S. than to Europe."
But even Mr. Scafuro, who plans to attend the institute in the fall, acknowledges that "it is perhaps not the most favorable moment to go study in the United States."
Among other things, the economic downturn has left many non-American M.B.A. students out in the cold when it comes to securing a summer job.
"We are not treated the same when recruitment time comes around," said Marcos Garcia March, a Spanish M.B.A. student between years at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University, who applied from Brazil, where he had been working. "To hire a foreigner costs more in terms of paperwork, and companies don't hire on an emotional basis."
Mr. Garcia March, speaking by phone from New York, also complained of tightened residence regulations in the United States since the Sept. 11 attacks and of increasingly touchy immigration officials.
"I have the impression of not being very welcome here," he said. "You get the feeling that you can always lose your privilege of studying in the United States and be deported even if you make just the slightest step out of line."

HEADLINE: Can Democracy Take Root in the Islamic World?; 
Seeing Iraq's Future By Looking at Its Past

BYLINE:  By Hassan bin Talal; Prince Hassan bin Talal of Jordan is moderator of the World Conference on Religion and Peace and president of the Club of Rome.

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan 

 BODY:
Faisal I, who became the first king of Iraq in 1921, was a man of wisdom and foresight. He achieved what few, if any, leaders of the Muslim and Arab world of the last century could have done: he brought together all of his country's disparate communities in a spirit of genuine friendship and reconciliation despite the constraints of the largest hegemonic power of that time, Britain. 
 One of the most remarkable results of the unity that King Faisal created was the Constitution of 1925, which not only incorporated points on human rights but also promoted the notion of a separation of powers. It is not hard to find parallels between the concepts expressed in this Constitution and those of the Charter of Medina, instituted at the time of the Prophet Muhammad -- nor indeed between both these documents and the American Constitution. 
 Iraq under Faisal I was a country whose citizens participated in building the nation, no matter one's denomination or affiliation, whether Shiite or Sunni, Chaldean or Sabaean, Arab or Kurd, Circassian or Turkman. Little wonder, then, that Iraq was the first Arab country to join theLeague of Nations, and became a model for other emerging nation-states in Middle East and beyond. 
Today, despite the painful reality of a postconflict Iraq -- whose orphans roam streets littered with unexploded weapons, where food and water is scarce and sanitation is almost nonexistent -- we see hopeful similarities to that fledgling state. As in the king's day, there is a sense of optimism, of a shared burden, and of a chance for freedom after a long period of absolute rule. 
Unfortunately, Iraq today, as in the king's time, is under occupation, and gripped by uncertainty as to whether this is a transitional phase toward a new beginning or something more sinister and unwelcome. Again, many Iraqis feel like unwilling recipients of a foreign interventionism whose slogan is "we know what is best." 
The occupying coalition talks of transitional justice. But how can it explain the absence of an Iraqi court to deal with the affairs of its citizens? Other than a new, relatively powerless governing council, why are Iraq's people -- inheritors of the cradle of human civilization itself and arguably some of the most sophisticated and advanced in the Arab world -- having to watch while others impose their will and their plans on the country? 
The people now in charge of Iraq, be they in Baghdad or Washington, seem to lack the cultural sensitivity and proper knowledge of Iraq and its neighbors, and to have little regard for the religious and spiritual values of the Iraqi people, lacking even an appreciation of Iraq's ecumenical and cosmopolitan past. Nor has the de facto authority shown any intention to put to use the intellectual and technical potential of the Iraqi people, causing even greater frustration, confusion and anger. 
Iraq could once again be the model for the developing nation-state if it is able to humanize economics and politics, putting its citizens' well-being at the center of policymaking. True leadership in the Islamic sense ought to be about respecting sincerely held individual and communal beliefs; citizenship in its most pluralistic sense; and the peaceful management of diversity. 
Of course, change in Iraq has to be peaceful and has to be desired by the people as a whole. That is not pandering to populism, but is the essence of strategic diplomacy. It is the historical legacy of King Faisal I, who enabled Iraqis to be stakeholders in their political future. The development -- not imposition -- of democracy in Iraq is vital. 
Yet the current situation, with an increasingly nervous American and British military force, is a classic example of bad governance. Not only is it being interpreted in Iraq and abroad as a blatant and unnecessary form of neocolonialism, it also threatens to reap a bitter harvest of anti-Americanism. It will further destabilize an already volatile region. 
Iraqis are rightly cautious of accepting solutions imposed on them by third parties that have their own economic or regional interests. They do not wish to find themselves, purposely or by default, having to ally with one or another interventionist force. Some steps to ensure a feeling (and reality) of Iraqi self-determination can be taken quickly. For example, Iraqi courts could be created to prosecute those convicted of serious felonies like murder, torture and rape. This would not only be the realization of justice in its most practical sense, but it would give Iraqi people some real power over their civil society. 
The arrogance of power must not lead us to abandon wisdom. Wisdom is to listen to the voice of the people. Wisdom is to humanize rather than demonize the "other." Wisdom is to have hope and to consider the alternative options constantly. My friend Shimon Shamir, the Israeli scholar and former ambassador to Jordan, has wisely urged us to "turn our attention from the threat projected by the extremists to the promise implied by the moderates." Those of us who truly wish to help Iraq must now focus our efforts on realizing that promise.

HEADLINE: Gunfire Sends Liberian Civilians Fleeing to Capital 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia, July 17 

 BODY:
With United Nations officials growing increasingly frustrated over delays in sending West African soldiers to enforce a fragile cease-fire in this country, a familiar tableau of terror emerged late this afternoon: the sound of mortar fire on Monrovia's northern outskirts sent weary civilians marching swiftly toward the city, mattresses and clothes piled on their heads.
 Government officials told reporters that rebels had begun advancing toward the capital and had attacked a government army base about 12 miles north of here. Independent verification of the report was impossible, and rebels denied there was any fighting. 
 Nevertheless, the exodus of villagers from the area renewed fears of fresh fighting between warring factions, with no peacekeepers in sight. 
West African countries have pledged to send between 1,000 and 1,500 soldiers but have yet to work out their entry and exit plans. In an interview this afternoon, Gen. Cheick Diarra, deputy executive secretary for the Economic Community of West African States, or Ecowas, said an assessment team of 10 military officials was scheduled to arrive here on Friday to lay the groundwork for deployment, which would begin in 10 to 15 days. 
Officials of the West African organization have been meeting with an American military team this week in Ghana, which currently holds the group's rotating chairmanship, to discuss how Washington can support their efforts. The Bush administration has not yet said whether it would dispatch American soldiers to this ravaged country.
The Bush administration has repeatedly said it would not send American soldiers to this country so long as Charles Taylor, the Liberian president, is in power.
Mr. Taylor has said he will not step aside until peacekeepers arrive. 
"The idea is to separate the warring parties and create a security zone around Monrovia," General Diarra said, speaking from the Ghanaian capital, Accra.
Speaking to reporters at the United Nations today, the recently named special representative to Liberia, Jacques Klein, called on the West African bloc to mobilize "very, very quickly." Delay, he said, "means no American decision, means no American commitment, means I can't send my assessment team there, which means I can't deploy the U.N. peacekeeping mission that we desperately need."

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Asks if a Genetic Test Is Sold Without Approval 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
In a move that could foreshadow a tightening of regulations on diagnostic testing, the Food and Drug Administration is questioning whether Roche began selling a novel genetic test without proper approval.
 In a letter sent to Roche last week and posted on the F.D.A.'s Web site, the agency said it appeared that the company had improperly classified its genetic test in a way that allowed it to circumvent the need for a regulatory review. It called in Roche officials to discuss the matter. 
 The posting of the letter appears to be a warning to test developers that the F.D.A. is beginning to look skeptically at a common industry practice of taking advantage of rules that speed tests to market without having to prove that they work. 
"I think the agency's concerned enough about the issue as a whole that it's starting to take some visible regulatory action," said Steven I. Gutman, director of in vitro diagnostic device evaluation and safety for the F.D.A. and the letter's author. 
Roche's test, introduced late last month, is intended to predict how an individual will react to certain drugs so that doctors can adjust doses accordingly. It is one of the first tests to be sold that focuses on so-called personalized medicine.
The test is also significant because it employs a gene chip, a sliver of glass dotted with specks of DNA that is used to detect genes. Until now, such chips have been used mainly for basic research, not diagnoses. 
Diagnostic tests that are sold widely to hospitals, doctors' offices and commercial laboratories must go through an F.D.A. approval process. But tests developed by a single laboratory and offered as a service by that laboratory do not require such approval, although the laboratory has to meet certain quality standards. These tests are sometimes known as home-brew tests.
Companies that develop tests they want to sell to many laboratories can take advantage of the home-brew system. Instead of selling a complete test requiring F.D.A. approval, they sell the basic ingredients of a test to clinical laboratories. The labs then use the ingredients to make home-brew tests. The ingredients, usually chemicals or pieces of DNA, are called analyte-specific reagents and are only lightly regulated. 
Roche, one of the leaders in the diagnostic testing business, is marketing its gene-chip test in such a way. But the F.D.A. said the test appeared to be a complete medical device that should have gone through the regulatory approval process.
Greg Heath, head of clinical genomics at Roche Molecular Diagnostics in Pleasanton, Calif., maintained in a statement that "the F.D.A. is not saying, at this point, that our conclusion is inappropriate, just that they would like to discuss the subject further."
The outcome of the discussions will be closely watched. "I think it's an excellent test case to see what direction the F.D.A. and manufacturers will go," said Lawrence Silverman, scientific director of the molecular diagnostic laboratory at the University of Virginia.
Dr. Silverman said that while labs knew how to deal with some reagents, they were not familiar with this test and would have trouble ensuring that testing was done properly. "Roche is putting out a product that, quite frankly, we don't know how to validate," he said. "It's a technology more advanced than we're used to."
The issue arises as some experts are calling for tougher regulation of genetic tests. The skeptics say there are already tests being marketed based on unsubstantiated science, like some that help consumers tailor their diets or their skin creams. 
"You don't have to look very widely on the Web to see bizarre genetic tests," Francis S. Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, said last month at the biotechnology industry's convention in Washington. "It runs the risk of fouling the whole nest." 
An advisory committee on genetic testing to the secretary of health and human services recommended in 2000 that the F.D.A. begin regulating certain genetic tests, even those developed as home brews. Dr. Gutman of the F.D.A. said the agency was considering proposing rules to regulate not just genetic tests but all "high risk" diagnostic tests, which are ones that can seriously affect patient or public health. 
The testing industry generally defends the home-brew system, saying it allows tests to be developed rapidly and economically in reaction to new genetic information. Some tests, like those for rare genetic diseases, would not be economical to develop if F.D.A. approval were required. 
"The risk you run is that the greater level of federal oversight of those tests, the less likely someone might be to try to develop the test," said Vince Stine, director of government affairs at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. 
The Roche test, the AmpliChip CYP450, uses a gene chip made by Affymetrix and looks for mutations in two genes that are involved in metabolizing up to 25 percent of existing drugs. People with genetic variations that cause fast breakdown of the drugs might need a higher dose. Those with slow metabolism could take a lower dose to prevent toxic levels of a drug from building up in their body. 
Another question about regulation might arise with tests now being developed to diagnose SARS. Some test developers have said that they will not seek F.D.A. approval, but will instead offer the tests as home brews, reagents or as research tests for studying the SARS virus -- though not for diagnosis. 
Murray Lumpkin, principal associate commissioner of the F.D.A., while acknowledging the need for SARS tests, said the agency would still want to review tests that would be widely distributed. "If a test is going to be used for patient-management decisions or quarantine decisions or isolation decisions, those are tests we'd consider significant," he said in an interview a few weeks ago. "We believe people ought to have confidence in the test that's being used."

HEADLINE: Tens of Thousands Will Lose College Aid, Report Says 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
The first report to document the impact of the government's new formula for financial aid has found that it will reduce the nation's largest grant program by $270 million and bar 84,000 college students from receiving any award at all.
 The report, by the Congressional Research Service, the research arm of Congress, does not calculate the full effect of the changes, since it does not consider the further cuts in student awards that will probably occur once the new formula is applied to billions of dollars in state awards and university grants. 
 But it does settle some uncertainty over the initial consequences of altering the intricate federal formula that governs the vast majority of the nation's financial aid.
Word of the changes has kindled a small storm in Washington in the last month. Members of Congress have put forward legislation in hopes of either gauging the toll of the new formula or stopping it; they have characterized the change as a way to cut education spending without facing the public. 
"The department is wrong to turn its back on students and families," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. "They need more financial aid for college, not less."
The Department of Education has cited its obligation under federal law to revise the formula and played down the impact. Sally L. Stroup, its assistant secretary for postsecondary education, told The Washington Post last month that "the changes will have a minimal impact on a handful of students." 
The figures cited in the report made clear, however, that the new formula would trim the government's primary award program, the Pell grant, by $270 million once it takes effect in the 2004-5 academic year. That amount, financial aid experts said, probably means that hundreds of thousands of students will end up getting smaller Pell grants, not counting the 84,000 who it is estimated will no longer qualify. 
"It's pretty hard to call several hundred thousand students a handful," said Brian K. Fitzgerald, director of the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, which was created by Congress to advise it on higher education. He estimated that more than one million students could receive smaller Pell grants because of the new formula. 
"It doesn't stop there," Mr. Fitzgerald added. "It will have a ripple effect through all the other financial aid programs -- state grants, loans and institutional dollars. The cumulative effect could be much larger." 
The department does not argue with the report's numbers -- in fact, it provided them -- but notes that government spending on education will continue to rise. Because of the swell in college-age students, and the rising popularity of higher education among low-income families, about 300,000 more people will receive Pell grants by 2004 than do now. 
"You're still going to have more money out there," said Jeff Andrade, deputy assistant secretary for higher education, adding that Pell grant costs could rise by more than $1 billion by 2004, even though many students will get smaller awards and others will not qualify at all. 
Whether it comes from states, universities or the federal government itself, the bulk of financial aid is dictated by a single formula that determines how much of a family's income is discretionary, and thus available for college expenses. 
Just as with income tax, families can deduct some of what they spend on state and local taxes. The deductions vary by state but this year, with few exceptions, the department reduced the amounts, sometimes cutting them in half or more. Because of that, families will often appear to have larger incomes, at least on paper, and will thus be expected to contribute more toward their students' college educations. 
"Our students could lose close to $6 million," said George Chin, director of financial aid for the City University of New York, where 36 percent of students receive Pell grants. "It's a lot of money, and it comes at a bad time, when the students can least afford it."
Though few doubt the department's authority to change the state tax tables, critics in Congress question why it chose to do so now, after nearly a decade of leaving them untouched and at a time when state taxes are going up, not down. 
Beyond that, tuitions are rising and the economy is strained. Senator Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey, called it an inconceivable time to enact the changes. 
The department says it followed the same procedures as previous administrations, drawing its data from the Internal Revenue Service.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: THE OUTLOOK; 
Safety and Jobs Are Top Issues For Iraq, Pentagon Advisers Say

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17 

 BODY:
A Pentagon advisory panel reported today that efforts to secure an allied victory in Iraq might fail unless public safety is extended throughout the nation within three months.
 A successful reconstruction program for Iraq will require a sustained and costly effort to provide jobs and basic services over the next year, the panel reported. The team was sent to Iraq by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. 
 "The Iraqi population has exceedingly high expectations, and the window for cooperation may close rapidly if they do not see progress on delivering security, basic services, opportunities for broad political involvement and economic opportunity," the report said.
The leader of the five-person team, John Hamre, a former deputy secretary of defense, wrote that "the enormity of this undertaking cannot be overstated," and added, "There are huge challenges ahead."
In its assessment, the group said that "the next 12 months will be critical to the success or failure of the Iraq reconstruction effort" and that "the next three months are crucial to turning around the security situation."
In addition to Mr. Hamre, president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a policy research institute, the panel's members were Frederick D. Barton and Bathsheba N. Crocker, also of the center; Robert C. Orr, Washington director of the Council on Foreign Relations; and Johanna Mendelson-Forman, of the United Nations Foundation. 
They spent 11 days in Iraq. 
The report saluted "the dedication and enthusiasm" of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the American-led administration for postwar Iraq.
But the report was also critical, saying that "under the current set-up," the provisional authority "is isolated and cut off from Iraqis" and hobbled by poor communications within its own organization and across Iraq.
The report also concluded that the Defense Department, which is the United States Government institution leading reconstruction in Iraq, has "relatively untested capacities" for this effort.
"The United States will need significant international assistance" to succeed in postwar Iraq, the report said, and the Bush administration must give the provisional authority "more resources, personnel and flexibility."
Bryan Whitman, the Pentagon's deputy spokesman, said today, "We agree with the assessment that there has been enormous progress in Iraq since the removal of the Saddam Hussein regime and that significant challenges lie ahead."
The panel recommended several areas for immediate attention, including establishing public safety throughout Iraq, expanding the role of Iraqis in the rebuilding process, finding jobs and providing basic economic and social services, decentralizing control over key functions of the provisional authority, and increasing financial support for the reconstruction effort.

Tension Over Who Prospers in an Indian Capital

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: GALLUP, N.M., July 15 

 BODY:
This town is lonesome, neon-lighted, tough. They say there are 20 bars in Gallup, 30 churches, 30 pawnshops and 60 trading posts.
 It is a town with 20,000 people, on a stretch of old Route 66 near the Arizona border. On the outskirts live at least 250,000 Indians. Navajo, Hopi, Pueblo, Zuni. This makes Gallup the Indian capital of the United States, and it is the Indians who make Gallup rich and poor. 
 Tourists come for their jewelry. The mining companies come for their coal. The government checks come at the beginning of the month. Somehow, the Indians remain poor. Unemployment among the Navajo hovers around 50 percent.
Of the 60 resale operations that sell Indian jewelry across town, the majority are owned by whites, and about one-quarter are owned by Arabs, newcomers called Hindians by clever locals who are not clever enough to tell the Middle East from the Indian subcontinent.
Indians make most of the jewelry sold in Gallup. But knockoff merchandise has flooded the market, causing the price for legitimate, handmade goods to drop.
Indian jewelers are trying to organize a boycott against the Arab merchants, who they believe are importing sham products.
It has not been successful. In need of cash, many Indian jewelry makers cannot help themselves when their stomachs come calling. They sell pieces for cheap to the merchants, who mark them up 2, 5, even 10 times the purchase price.
Some sell to the trading post, others to the pawnshop. Either way, it is a non-Indian who profits.
This has created the boil.
"You can blame Indian people for their inability to get things together," says Tom Arviso, publisher of The Navajo Times. "But there are a lot of sleazy guys on Front Street making it off Indian people. They take advantage of their needs."
Arabs see it differently.
"Don't blame the Arab for the way the market works," said Ehab Maadi, a native Palestinian who owns the Apache Trading Company. "Some squeeze harder than others. But we the newcomers are caught in the old history here that we had nothing to do with. The resentment, I usually hear it when people are drunk."
For 100 years, it was the whites who profited in trade with the Indians, taking beads and saddles and blankets as collateral for food and clothing until it was time to ship cattle to Chicago or shear sheep for wool. Over the years, the pawn business developed, where the broker takes 10 percent the first month, 4 percent every month thereafter. Today, Indians account for 90 percent of the pawn clientele.
Now it is the Arabs who own a large and growing part of both the jewelry and pawn trades.
"The Arabs are taking over, and we don't like it," said Marie Perry, a Navajo jeweler who will no longer sell to the Arab merchants because, she says, the prices are too low and their business style is rude.
"I'd rather sell to the Americans," she said. "At least I know the white people. They're fair."
The first Arabs appeared here about 30 years ago, selling scarves and linen to tourists from their trunks. They discovered first Indian jewelry and second a market for it. They have flourished on the Internet. They are blamed for importing imitations from China and the Philippines.
The problem has gotten so bad, an estimated 40 percent of the stock in Gallup is knockoff, said Ralph A. Richards, former president of the Chamber of Commerce and a white man who is trying to help form a cooperative of Indian artists and vendors. State and federal law prohibit selling goods as Indian made if they are not.
"The forgeries are against the law," Mr. Richards said. "But it's almost impossible to launch a boycott. When it gets down to it, people need a dollar."
The pawn and jewelry business pulls in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, Mr. Richards estimates, from tourists, Internet sales and people down on their luck.
"The pawn goes back a long time, before we even knew we had a country here," said Bill Richardson, of Richardson's Trading Company and Cash Pawn, established in 1913. His store is packed with silver and wool and jade and redolent of leather saddles. He is a white man who speaks Navajo.
"It's the Arabs that got a reputation of exploiters," he said, not kindly. "Indian people been coming to me four generations. We've got a relationship built up. It's almost family. I don't sell fakes."
Mr. Maadi says he does not sell fakes either. But that is how it goes with stereotypes.
"We and the Indians, I tell them we have a similar history and we should not have problems," he said. "But most don't even know their own history. It's an oasis of illiteracy."

HEADLINE: Will Congress Let Accounting Fiction Obscure Pension Reality? 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
WHAT should be done when an important sector of the American economy has severe problems?
 The easy answer is to avoid admitting the problems and hope that time will make everything better. Look for an accounting gimmick to obscure the reality. 
 That is how the government dealt with the early days of the savings and loan crisis two decades ago. It made the situation much worse than it needed to be.
Which brings us to the corporate pension system. Much of corporate America is looking for a way to make its pension deficits appear smaller than they really are, and the politicians appear to be tempted to comply.
The argument companies are making is that if something is not done to make pensions look better, then many companies will terminate their plans. So if you want them to do a better job of telling the truth about the health of pension plans, you are working against the interests of workers who want to collect those pensions.
The reverse is true. Applying reality now would make it harder for companies to avoid putting cash into pension plans that need it. And while those payments might be painful, they would leave the plans more likely to meet their obligations and avoid a crisis.
The Bush administration is seeking to shed some light on this area and to get away from some of the worst accounting gimmicks that have arisen in past years. Unfortunately, the Bush plan will take years to phase in, meaning fictions will continue longer than they should.
But when Peter R. Fisher, the Treasury under secretary for domestic finance, testified at a House hearing this week, the static he heard was not from lawmakers who questioned why accurate numbers were being delayed. They were upset that the numbers he wants to provide would make pension plans look worse than they now appear.
On the surface, the argument is about one of those MEGO -- My Eyes Glaze Over -- things that no ordinary person could possibly care about: What is the best way to estimate the current value of future pension obligations? Companies want to make those obligations look smaller by using a high interest rate in estimating how much money they need now to pay benefits in the future.
Current law has allowed some companies -- particularly ones with older workers -- to assume unreasonably high interest rates. In addition, the rules have allowed companies to ignore current market interest rates and instead use average rates over a four-year period. The effect has been to give companies a false sense of security, letting them delay putting money into their pension plans.
The Bush plan would require companies use current market rates and says that short-term obligations should be discounted at lower shorter-term rates. Companies that make such calculations every day are trying to persuade Congress that would be just too complicated and volatile. And they might win a House subcommittee vote today.
That would be amazing. A year after passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was spurred by outrage over the games companies played to fool their shareholders, Congress could sanction similar games with pension plans.
"America's pension beneficiaries are every bit as entitled to timely and accurate accounting and disclosure as are America's shareholders," said Mr. Fisher, adding that accounting fictions could lead to systematic underfunding of pension plans, particularly those with older workers.
Keeping bad news off the books only made the savings and loan problems worse. Why repeat that mistake?

HEADLINE: No Time to Lose on North Korea 

 BODY:
If North Korea is not bluffing, it may have already produced enough plutonium to be within striking distance of building six new nuclear bombs. Short of a war no one wants, the only way to prevent that development is through a diplomatic agreement. That is why China's urgent efforts to revive the three-way talks that have been suspended since April are crucially important. The Bush administration should embrace Beijing's welcome intercession and be ready to explore a comprehensive deal that would end North Korea's nuclear ambitions in exchange for international aid and security guarantees. 
 Nearly three precious months have been lost since the initial discussions by American, North Korean and Chinese representatives in Beijing broke up with no resumption scheduled. North Korea soured the atmosphere of the talks with vituperative criticism of American policies. The price it demanded for abandoning its nuclear weapons programs was extravagant and unrealistic. But American officials also recognized that in its own peculiar way, the North was signaling its continued openness to a negotiated settlement that would verifiably end its nuclear weapons activity. Subsequent unofficial contacts, including a May visit to Pyongyang by Representative Curt Weldon, a Pennsylvania Republican, confirmed this. What is needed now is for Washington to make a serious counterproposal. 
 Each day increases the risk that North Korea will succeed in producing new nuclear weapons, and perhaps even testing one of them to prove its success. Those steps would only increase the dangers and complicate the chances for a peaceful resolution. 
Washington cannot resign itself to a North Korea free to threaten its neighbors with nuclear destruction and sell plutonium to rogue states and terrorists. Nor can it consider military action, which could ignite a new war on the Korean peninsula and possibly lead to a North Korean nuclear attack on Japan. Diplomacy is the only acceptable alternative, and time may be running short.
Earlier this year, the White House, wanting no distractions from its drive to oust Saddam Hussein, deliberately played down the urgency of the North Korean threat. Internal policy divisions within the administration led to further delays. While diplomacy has remained suspended, Washington is preparing plans for pressuring North Korea through economic sanctions and seizures of suspicious North Korean cargos at sea. 
Despite the delays, a diplomatic solution still seems within reach. Experts who know North Korea say that its rulers' paramount concern is their own survival in power. The North Korean leadership worries obsessively about an American military attack and is constantly scrambling for additional revenue to sustain its country's imploding economy and finance its armed forces and advanced weapons programs. The United States' challenge is to convince North Korea's leaders that these goals can be achieved only by permanently and verifiably ending the production and export of unconventional weapons. That will require not just threats and not just diplomacy, but a sophisticated combination of both.
Mr. Bush understandably dislikes the idea of rewarding North Korea for giving up its nuclear program. Diplomacy isn't always pretty. But if it can prevent a nuclear North Korea without a catastrophic war, Washington must give it every chance.

HEADLINE: G.M.'s Net Income Declined 30% in Second Quarter 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 17 

 BODY:
General Motors reported a 30 percent decline in second-quarter net income today, in large part because of falling vehicle sales in North America coupled with a price war that continues to escalate. 
 G.M.'s results were also hurt by $168 million in costs from a tornado in May that shut down the company's Oklahoma City assembly plant for nearly two months. The plant makes midsize sport utility vehicles like the Chevrolet Trailblazer. 
 But the company was upbeat about the outlook for the second half of the year, in contrast to a gloomier picture offered by the Ford Motor Company, which reported lower earnings on Wednesday. 
"We're looking at the market over the last 60 to 90 days and feeling better," John M. Devine, G.M.'s chief financial officer, said in an interview. He added that the company expected the economy to recover in the second half of the year and increase industry sales.
"We're not feeling wonderful, but it's an improvement from what we saw in the first quarter," he said. 
In the quarter, G.M. reported net income of $901 million, or $1.58 a share, compared with $1.29 billion, or $2.43 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue was flat at $48.3 billion.
The results handily beat Wall Street's estimates of $1.19 a share, according to Thomson First Call. But analysts expressed concern about the company's diminishing profits in the crucial North American market.
The report came as contract talks opened between G.M. and the United Automobile Workers here. Big Three labor talks are being closely watched because foreign competitors like Toyota and Honda have much lower labor costs.
Several dozen G.M. retirees staged a traditional rally here as the talks opened and said they were most concerned about cuts to their health benefits. 
"They're going to take some away," said Jim Stewart, 69, a retired machine operator from a transmission plant in Flint, Mich., that has been much reduced in size since his days there. "It's how much." 
Mary Ann Bark, 63, said her top concern was reflected by a placard she carried, which said "G.M. don't even think!! of messing with our health care!!"
"We're retirees, so it's top on our list," said Ms. Bark, who inspected spark plugs for defects. "We don't want any more, just what we've got."
Last year, G.M. spent $4.5 billion in cash on health care and its total accounting expense was $5 billion. Automakers based in Japan and Germany are aided by nationalized health care. And though companies like Toyota and Honda assemble many vehicles here, their plants are much newer and have few retirees, who make up the bulk of the Big Three's health costs.
Ron Gettelfinger, the U.A.W. president, has said the union will not yield on its health benefits, which are some of the best in the nation. Most retirees have only a $5 co-payment for prescription drugs, the fastest-growing component of health care costs. 
Henry Oginsky, 72, who spent 42 years working at a Buick plant in Flint, said the tough conditions merited such benefits. "They had asbestos in the factories when we were working," he said, "I'm on 12 pills a day, and that's G.M.'s fault." 
At the same time, the U.A.W.'s membership has been cut by more than half in the last two decades as the Big Three's share of the market has declined. 
On G.M.'s earnings outlook, Mr. Devine said the company now expected a profit of $4.50 to $5 a share for the full year after earning $3.39 a share in the first half. Earlier in the year, the company had backed away from a goal of earning $5 a share, but Mr. Devine said today that the goal was in reach. 
The company is being more bullish in its outlook for the second half of the year than Ford, which forecast flat earnings for the rest of the year.
Shares of G.M. fell 18 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $35.74.
Results were bolstered by record quarterly profits at the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, G.M.'s giant lending arm, driven by its mortgage division, whose business has been lifted by low interest rates.
G.M.'s performance in Asia, buoyed by the growing China market, also markedly improved, and the company stemmed its losses in Europe. 
But huge pressure remains in North America, where industry sales are shrinking, the Big Three is fighting a price war and G.M.'s market share fell in the second quarter. Net income from North American automotive operations declined to $83 million from $1.3 billion in the quarter a year earlier.
John Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch, wrote in a research note that results at the core North American operations were well below expectations, even accounting for the tornado damage, which cost the company 30 cents a share.
One main culprit is declining prices, but G.M. said today that it would stop disclosing specific data on how much its net prices are decreasing. Net prices are the combination of sticker prices with the effects of factors like big rebates and interest-free financing. 
"We think in showing it, it was adding more confusion," Mr. Devine said.
"Some of our competition were doing it differently, and people were trying to compare the couple measures out there and that was not good," he added.
He said the company would instead continue to disclose changes in how much revenue it is taking in for each vehicle, a measure that combines pricing and whether customers are continuing to move away from passenger cars to more profitable sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. 
Some analysts expressed surprise at the move on the company's earnings conference call.
"Revenue per unit and net price are very different, and I think it hurts your transparency to take it away," said Ronald A. Tadross, an analyst at Bank of America.

HEADLINE: McGreevey Backs Rutgers on Pro-Palestine Seminar 

BYLINE:  By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey declined yesterday to step in to prevent a student group from holding a pro-Palestine conference at Rutgers University in October, even though some Jewish leaders and others say the group promotes anti-Semitic views.
 Mr. McGreevey met with the president of Rutgers, Richard L. McCormick, yesterday to respond to growing criticism that the National Student Conference of the Palestine Solidarity Movement was being organized by students with ties to terrorists. 
 But even before his meeting with Dr. McCormick, the governor had been assured by the state's Office of Counterterrorism that it had no evidence that the student group sponsoring the forum, New Jersey Solidarity, had ties to such groups, said Kathleen Ellis, the governor's director of communications.
Ms. Ellis said that while the governor did not agree with the views espoused by the group, he had decided not to try to overturn the university president's decision to allow the conference.
"The fact of the matter is," Ms. Ellis said, "though he personally has very strong negative feelings about this group's message, it does come down to this is America and we all have a right to express our views as long as it's not a threat to anyone's safety. No one gets to pick and choose who gets to speak, who gets the stage."
In a statement issued after the meeting, Dr. McCormick said he and the governor had had a "friendly and productive conversation" in which they dwelled on the importance of free speech.
"The governor and I agreed that we find the views of New Jersey Solidarity to be reprehensible," he said. "But we also agreed that the best way to counter deplorable arguments is more discussion, not less, and that the appropriate place for this kind of discourse is the university. Governor McGreevey and I share the belief that the strength of our society depends on such openness."
When the university approved the conference last week, critics said Rutgers should not be condoning the activities of a group that is dedicated to the destruction of Israel.
In its Web site, the group, which officially calls itself New Jersey Solidarity -- Activists for the Liberation of Palestine, describes itself as a "grass-roots organization dedicated to resistance and action in support of the Palestinian struggle for justice, national liberation, human rights and self-determination." It goes on to say that it is dedicated to building coalitions and educating the public "against racism and all forms of oppression," and calls for an immediate end to all United States political, military and economic aid to Israel.
"We unconditionally support Palestinians' human right to resist occupation and oppression by any means necessary," it goes on to say.
Those kinds of messages worry supporters of Israel.
Last week, a co-president of the State Senate, John O. Bennett of Monmouth County, called the conference "abominable" and asked the governor to force the university to cancel it.
The New Jersey Anti-Defamation League also condemned the group's message.
"Our complaints against them have nothing to do with their criticism of Israeli policy and everything to do with their agenda of the destruction of the state of Israel," said Shai Goldstein, regional director of the New Jersey group. "They believe the state of Israel should be destroyed by any means necessary."
At Rutgers, a representative for Hillel, an organization for Jewish college students, said he was not surprised that the conference was being allowed to continue.
"It was not Hillel's position that the conference be canceled," said Andrew Getraer, the group's executive director. "Our concern about the conference is that organizers have expressed such extremist views in support of suicide bombs and against the right of Israel to exist that our campus is going to be flooded with this type of extremist propaganda, and that people outside the campus community with similar views are going to be attracted here and they may act irresponsibly."
But he said he was confident that the university and state officials would monitor the situation and provide the necessary security.
No one from New Jersey Solidarity responded to requests for comments, but on its Web site, the group posted several responses to the criticism of the conference and attempts to get the governor to step in.
"As a student organization, we are entitled to the same rights as all other student organizations, rights recognized by the university," the group says.
In its long message, the group never addresses the accusation that it is affiliated with violent groups, but instead says it will continue to call for a free Palestinian state.
"We will continue to demonstrate, mobilize, organize and take action, and we look forward to the successful third North American conference to bring the numerous organizers throughout the continent together to strengthen our movement, strategize for the future, and build a sustainable movement linked to our sisters and brothers in Palestine."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: SECURITY FORCE; 
U.S. Considers Private Iraqi Force to Guard Sites

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17 

 BODY:
The Pentagon is considering a plan to train a private Iraqi security force and make it responsible for guarding pipelines, government buildings and hundreds of other sites in Iraq, military officials said today.
 The new private force, to be composed primarily of former Iraqi soldiers armed with small weapons, would take over from American troops the guard duties at as many as 2,000 sites, the officials said. Such a force would provide jobs to potentially thousands of unemployed Iraqis and ease the burden on an American military that is finding itself stretched thin in Iraq despite the presence there of nearly 150,000 soldiers. Some Pentagon officials believe private Iraqi security guards at prominent government sites could help ease tensions created by the atmosphere of foreign military occupation. 
 But such a transfer would also raise some security concerns by putting more weapons in the hands of the former Iraqi soldiers and other Iraqis who would compose a force that could include hundreds or even thousands of security guards, the officials said. They said the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad and private American companies, including Kroll Inc., a well-known private security consulting concern, were discussing how members of the proposed force could be screened and approved.
The cost of training the Iraqi force would likely be paid by United States taxpayers, military officials said. The salaries for the Iraqi guards might also be paid by the United States, the officials said, at least until an Iraqi government emerges, although funds could be drawn from Iraqi oil revenue.
The proposed force, under discussion at the highest levels of the Pentagon, would be separate from the new Iraqi Army and Iraqi police force.
"The idea, first and foremost, is to have Iraqis providing security for Iraq, at places like the National Museum and other fixed sites, and there are civilian companies that do this very well," a senior military official said today. "An added benefit is that we definitely want to reduce the load on American soldiers."
A senior executive at Kroll said in a telephone interview that the company had been involved in "brainstorming sessions" in Baghdad with officials of the Coalition Provisional Authority about a possible role for the company in establishing a private Iraqi security force.
"Our sense is that the military has too much on their plate right now, and that these are issues that need to be addressed, and the way to do that is through the private sector," said the executive, Anne Tiedemann, a regional managing director and head of Kroll's Europe, Middle East and Africa Region.
Ms. Tiedemann said the talks had not gone beyond a discussion phase, and military officials in Washington said no final decision had been reached. The officials would not offer any estimate of when the force might be established, how large it might be or what it might cost.
But the officials said that senior officers at the United States Central Command and the Pentagon were in favor of the idea and were proceeding on the assumption that the plan would swiftly be approved. They said they believed that the cost of training the Iraqi guards would be paid by American taxpayers.
"There will be a vetting process, because we have to insure as best we can that we don't put weapons in the hands of the wrong people," one senior officer said. "But having said that, there are already vast amounts of weapons out there in Iraq in the hands of former regime officials, and compared to that this would be just a drop in the bucket."
Ms. Tiedemann said she recognized that "certainly there are some sensitivities about potentially arming individuals who might be perceived to some people as being high risk." Still, she said, "There is absolutely a way to address all of these issues, from a vetting standpoint, from a training standpoint, from a cultural standpoint, to be inclusive." 
Kroll, based in New York, conducted an investigation in the early 1990's to determine the location and value of assets Saddam Hussein's regime had hidden outside of Iraq. The investigation was done for the Kuwaiti government as part of an effort to determine what assets could be seized as reparations for the damage to Kuwait during the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
Under the plan described by the military officials, Kroll or another private American company would be awarded a contract to provide training for the new Iraqi security force and would work with the American military and intelligence agencies in screening its members.
So far the United States has taken a leading role in the reestablishment both of a new, smaller Iraqi Army and a revitalized Iraqi police force. American officials are stripping the forces of top commanders and insisting that the officers, soldiers and policemen disavow any ties to the Baath Party and Mr. Hussein's regime.
In outlining plans last month to form a new Iraqi Army over the next three years, American and British officials said the force would amount to about 40,000 soldiers, one-tenth the size of Mr. Hussein's armed forces at their peak. Walter B. Slocombe, the senior American official in Iraq responsible for the dissolution of Mr. Hussein's armed forces, said an initial force of 12,000 would be formed within a year. 
That Iraqi force would operate without an air force, Mr. Slocombe said, and would be responsible for guarding the country's borders and key installations.
The occupation powers also agreed last month to pay, for an indefinite period, the salaries of up to 250,000 idled Iraqi soldiers. But most of those soldiers remain out of work, and American officials said one benefit of a new security force is that it could provide jobs for at least some of the unemployed soldiers.
A senior United States military official said today that creating a private security force to guard some installations in Iraq made sense for the same reason that private security forces were used to guard American installations like the Smithsonian Institution and power plants. 
"There are lots of times when it doesn't make sense to put the military out front," the official said. "And in many instances, we think it will be better for the Iraqi people to see private Iraqi security guards instead of the American or Iraqi Army."

HEADLINE: Gene Is Linked to Susceptibility to Depression 

BYLINE:  By MARY DUENWALD 

 BODY:
Scientists have identified a gene that may help explain why some people become depressed in response to the stresses of life and others skate by relatively unscathed.
 The gene, which comes in two forms, or alleles, can either protect people from depression or make them more vulnerable, researchers report today in the journal Science. 
 In the study, people who experienced job loss, death in the family, abuse or other traumas were much more likely to develop depression if they possessed two copies of the short allele. Those with two copies of the long allele (pronounced uh-LEEL) were able to withstand such events without becoming depressed. 
"No matter how many stressful events they had in a five-year period, they were no more likely to become depressed than people who had no stressful events at all," said Dr. Terrie E. Moffitt, a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin and King's College London, who collaborated on the study with scientists in Britain and New Zealand.
People who have inherited the short allele from one parent and the long one from the other, the researchers found, are moderately vulnerable to depression.
The results tie together two of the greatest risk factors for depression.
"The evidence that stressful life events increase the risk of depression has been strong for about a decade," said Dr. Kenneth Kendler, a psychiatrist at Virginia Commonwealth University, in Richmond, who was not connected to the study.
"We also know that depression has a moderate level of heritability -- about half your risk of depression comes from your genes," he said. "The question has been, do these risk factors add or do they multiply? The answer is that they multiply."
The new findings also help explain the sharp differences in the way individuals react to stress.
"Almost all of us know people who are fairly stress free," Dr. Kendler said. "They like to sky-dive. Or they work as emergency-room physicians. With others, when the boss gives them a bad evaluation, they're upset for a week."
The study followed 847 New Zealanders from birth to age 26. Seventeen percent of the subjects carried two copies of the short allele, 31 percent had two copies of the long allele and 51 percent had one of each.
Over the years, the researchers tracked each subject's exposure to stressful events like long-term unemployment, debt problems, trouble in intimate relationships, homelessness, disabling injuries and physical or sexual abuse. Fifteen percent of the subjects suffered four or more such crises at ages 21 to 26.
Within that group, 43 percent of those with two copies of the short allele developed depression. Thirty-three percent of those with one short and one long allele did. But only 17 percent of those with two copies of the long gene developed depression, about the same number as would be expected to have depression had they experienced no crises at all.
A certain amount of depression arises independently of stressful events, Dr. Moffitt noted.
Nearly twice as many women as men suffer from depression. Yet women were found no more likely than men to carry the short allele.
Perhaps, Dr. Moffitt said, women's vulnerability to depression is not connected to the way they respond to stressful events.
"There's nothing about this gene interacting with stress that accounts for the sex difference," Dr. Moffitt said. 
Among those who suffered the most stressful events, the subjects with the short alleles were also more likely to consider or attempt suicide. Only4 percent of those with the long alleles thought of killing themselves, compared with 11 percent of those with the short ones.
The long alleles also seemed to shield those who experienced abuse during childhood -- one subject in 10 -- from depression in adulthood, the researchers found.
The gene, known as 5-HTT, has been a focus of depression studies because it contains the code to produce a protein that escorts the chemical messenger serotonin across the spaces between brain cells, or synapses, and then clears away the leftover serotonin. Drugs like Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Celexa, which are widely effective in treating depression, work by acting on the serotonin system.
Earlier studies in mice and monkeys have shown a connection between the 5-HTT gene and anxiety. Last year, researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health found that people with two copies of the short allele were more likely than others to become anxious when shown pictures of scary faces.
The short allele produces the same protein as the long one, but less of it. As a result, Dr. Moffitt said, it manages serotonin less efficiently. 
The study suggests that among people who suffer a series of stressful events, the gene could predict who will suffer depression about as well as a bone mineral density test can predict who will suffer a fractured hip, the researchers said.
Still, they said it was too early to use 5-HTT as a diagnostic test. The study must be repeated, and other genes that play a role in vulnerability to depression must identified.

PERSON: Charlotte L. Kates 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Law Student With a History of Taking Left Turns

BYLINE:  By CHRIS HEDGES

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
WHEN Charlotte L. Kates was in elementary school, she devoured a series of books on foreign countries. One nation, however, captured her imagination. She was in the family car on her way to a children's arts festival in Philadelphia, when, she said, the utopian vision of a communist society in the Soviet Union leapt off the pages and inspired her to be a revolutionary.
 She never looked back. As a law student at Rutgers University, and one of the leaders of New Jersey Solidarity, a pro-Palestinian student group, Ms. Kates has reserved space at Rutgers this October for the Third North American Student Conference of the Palestine Solidarity Movement. The gathering will draw hundreds of student activists from the United States and Canada, and they will converge on the New Brunswick campus, she said, to "organize against the Israeli occupation of Palestine." 
 The forum has attracted the attention of state politicians, including Gov. James E. McGreevey and John O. Bennett, the Republican leader in the State Senate.
Mr. Bennett sent a letter to the governor asking him to "prevent our prestigious and world-renowned university from hosting this abominable conference." 
The governor met with the Rutgers president, Richard L. McCormick, yesterday to discuss the conference, among other things. According to the governor's office, Mr. McGreevey left the meeting supporting Dr. McCormick's decision to let the conference take place.
Ms. Kates also stirred up the campus in March when her organization reserved banner space for two weeks at the Douglass College Center. The banner read: "From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will be Free."
"It was a call for all land between the Jordanian River and the Mediterranean to be returned to the Palestinians," she said.
Such a call also meant Israel would be wiped off the map. The Israel Action Committee of Rutgers organized a sit-in at the center demanding that the banner be removed. It was not.
New Jersey Solidarity takes a hard line in its support of the Palestinians. Ms. Kates will not, for instance, condemn suicide bombings, saying "it is not our place in the United States to dictate the tactics Palestinian groups use in the liberation struggle."
Seated in a small coffee shop near the Rutgers Law School on Monday, Ms. Kates, 23, recalled the book she was reading on that car trip to Philadelphia years ago. "The book quoted the 1917 revolutionary slogan: peace, land, bread and freedom," she said. "This idea hit me. I had to find out more about socialism."
SHE began to read Lenin and Marx. She looked up the American Communist Party's local chapter in New Jersey, where she grew up. She rode her bike on Sunday afternoons to local party meetings. By age 13, she said, she had joined the party, paying monthly dues of 50 cents.
"It is a workers party, so dues are paid on a sliding scale," she said. "I kept it from my parents. A year later, a clerk at the supermarket mentioned to my mother that she had seen me handing out copies of the communist newspaper the People's Weekly World at the Collingswood train station. The clerk wanted to know if my mother was also a communist."
Her parents, although not pleased, allowed her to continue. Activism does not run in her family, but she is quick to add that "my parents are working class." Her brother, Benjamin Kates III, 16 years her senior, is a United States marshal in Texas. Her father, Benjamin Kates Jr., now retired, drove heavy equipment. Her mother, Carol, is a service representative in a bank.
Her decision to "side with the oppressed, liberation movements and the working class" is one that has led her to butt heads repeatedly with authority. In the seventh grade, she agitated to loosen the dress code at her school and reduce the lunch fees. "It was called the 'lunch costs too much campaign,' " she said.
Later, she used a board, reserved for honors students to note important moments in history, to mark anniversaries like the protest on March 6, 1930, when a million Americans across the country marched for unemployment insurance.
As an undergraduate at Rutgers in 2000, she helped organize a "people's convention" to run a radical slate for City Council in New Brunswick. The slate, which had three candidates, received 28 percent of the vote.
Her small dorm room at Rutgers, which she shares with three other first-year law students, is decorated with the requisite picture of Che Guevara, a hero of the Cuban revolution, along with a poster of Nabil Salameh, a slain radical Palestinian leader. 
A poster on the wall reads: "Long Live the Proletarian Feminism of the Heroic Red Women Fighters of Peru." Without a moment's hesitation, she said her favorite book is "The State and Revolution" by Lenin.
She has a weakness for Dr. Pepper. There was a case on her floor. And she makes room on her wall for prints by the artist Gustav Klimt.
The day after being featured in an article in The New York Post this month with the headline "Rutgers gets 'F' For Putting Anti-Semitism 101 on the Schedule," she lost her summer job as a customer service representative for an electronics company in Teaneck.
"They told me it was because they were doing financial restructuring," she said, her signature red kaffiyeh draped around her shoulders, "but I have my doubts."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 19, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the Public Lives profile yesterday about Charlotte L. Kates, a law student at Rutgers University who is a leader of New Jersey Solidarity, a pro-Palestinian student group, gave an erroneous identification in some copies for the official who received hundreds of messages protesting the plan for a conference at Rutgers. He was Richard L. McCormick, the university president, not Gov. James E. McGreevey.

HEADLINE: NYC; 
Subway Fare: Bottom Line On Jump to $2

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
ONCE prices go up, they don't come down. That was the opinion heard around town this week after a state appeals court gave its blessing to the higher mass-transit fares and tolls in effect since May.
 In doing that, the court reversed the decisions of lower-level judges who had ordered a fare rollback, having found the Metropolitan Transportation Authority guilty of bad faith, bad judgment and nearly everything else short of bad breath. 
 For a while, some New Yorkers dared to dream the impossible dream: a refund. When that bubble burst, many reacted with world-weary sighs. Aah, we knew it all along, they said. 'Twas too good to be true. Indeed, once prices go up, they don't come down. 
But sometimes they do. The transit fare is an example, especially for New Yorkers who regularly use the subway and buses. Even with this fare increase, to a base of $2, they are paying less than the old $1.50 base and barely more than they were a decade ago.
The reason, of course, is the MetroCard, which has sent the subway token to a retirement home. The card makes possible an assortment of discounts long championed by advocacy groups like the Straphangers Campaign that are now taking the transportation authority to task and to court.
Under the old $1.50 base fare, the authority estimated that the average rider was actually paying only $1.04, thanks to the discounts and free transfers between buses and the subway. (Many people have already forgotten that such transfers were impossible until just a few years ago.)
Granted, the agency's math has been seriously called into question. Its leaders admit, somewhat belatedly, that they have been far from models of clarity or transparency about their finances.
But unless you have better numbers in your pocket, it is hard to challenge that $1.04 figure. It amounts to 4 cents more than the $1 fare that prevailed in the late 1980's, pre-MetroCard. Not exactly a sign of rampant inflation, is it?
O.K., the base fare is now up to $2. No one is happy about it. But with the discounts, the transportation authority projects that the cost of a ride will average about $1.30. Its estimates will have to do for a while because it is too soon for hard numbers.
That $1.30 is comfortably below the old base fare of $1.50. It is also a mere nickel above the $1.25 that was the fare from 1992 to 1995.
True, not all people do benefit equally from the MetroCard, as the Straphangers Campaign often points out. The discounts favor riders who can shell out a hefty sum -- $70 for the 30-day card, for example -- more than those able to spare only a few dollars at a time. Also, some people have no choice but to pay the full $2.
Still, the principle behind all the discounts is the same: those who rely on them the most will enjoy the greatest benefits. If you ride the subway or the bus a lot, your cost per ride will significantly shrink, ending up much closer to $1 than to $2. Is there a more fundamental goal for mass-transit advocates than to increase ridership and, in the process, keep cars off the streets?
PERHAPS the real issue is that price increases have not come often enough. That is what some officials are beginning to think, and they have more than mass transit in mind.
In the last month, both the State University and the City University of New York have substantially raised undergraduate tuition, by as much as 28 percent. Both went eight years with no increases at all.
Taxi fares in New York are likely to rise appreciably; they have not budged in seven years. The recent increase in the property tax, 18.5 percent, was the first in more than a decade. Back to the mass-transit fare, it had not gone up in seven and a half years. For three decades before that, fares rose every two or three years, on average, always by relatively small amounts.
Peter S. Kalikow, the transportation authority chairman, has said that a return to more modest, but more frequent, increases may be the wiser path. Matthew Goldstein, the City University chancellor, has made a similar point about tuition increases.
The concept makes sense to Mitchell Moss, an urban affairs specialist at New York University and an adviser to the mayor. If price increases are necessary and inevitable, Professor Moss said, better that they come in small doses, in good times as well as bad. That way, he said, "it's a lot easier for people to absorb."
The alternative is sticker shock, which is what New Yorkers are now experiencing -- and not liking it one bit.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Albany: Jobless Rate Steady 

BYLINE:  By Janny Scott (NYT); Compiled by Anthony Ramirez 

 BODY:
 New York City continued to lose jobs in June, but the overall jobless rate remained steady, according to monthly figures released yesterday by the New York State Department of Labor. There were job declines in industries like securities and film production but gains in construction. 
The city unemployment rate remained at 8.1 percent. For the first time since February 1991, the state rate, 6.1 percent, was lower than the national rate, which is 6.4 percent. William C. Thompson, the New York City comptroller, estimated the number of jobs lost in the city in June, after seasonal adjustment, at 9,000. Stephen Kagann, chief economist to Gov. George E. Pataki, said signs of renewed activity on Wall Street offered hope for the city. The city has lost about 242,000 jobs since the number peaked in December 2000. Janny Scott (NYT)

HEADLINE: Passing It Along 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Here's another sentence in George Bush's State of the Union address that wasn't true: "We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other presidents and other generations." 
 Mr. Bush's officials profess to see nothing wrong with the explosion of the national debt on their watch, even though they now project an astonishing $455 billion budget deficit this year and $475 billion next year. But even the usual apologists (well, some of them) are starting to acknowledge the administration's irresponsibility. Will they also face up to its dishonesty? It has been obvious all along, if you were willing to see it, that the administration's claims to fiscal responsibility have rested on thoroughly cooked books. 
 The numbers tell the tale. In its first budget, released in April 2001, the administration projected a budget surplus of $334 billion for this year. More tellingly, in its second budget, released in February 2002 -- that is, after the administration knew about the recession and Sept. 11 -- it projected a deficit of only $80 billion this year, and an almost balanced budget next year. Just six months ago, it was projecting deficits of about $300 billion this year and next.
There's no mystery about why the administration's budget projections have borne so little resemblance to reality: realistic budget numbers would have undermined the case for tax cuts. So budget analysts were pressured to high-ball estimates of future revenues and low-ball estimates of future expenditures. Any resemblance to the way the threat from Iraq was exaggerated is no coincidence at all.
And just as some people argue that the war was justified even though it was sold on false pretenses, some say that the biggest budget deficit in history is justified even though the administration got us here with cooked numbers.
Some point out that Ronald Reagan ran even bigger deficits as a share of G.D.P. But they hope people won't remember that in the face of those deficits, Mr. Reagan raised taxes, reversing part of his initial tax cut.
Furthermore, this time huge deficits have emerged just a few years before the baby boomers start retiring and placing huge demands on Social Security and Medicare. The Social Security system is running a surplus right now, in preparation for future demands; the rest of the federal government is paying one-third of its expenses with borrowed money. That's a record. 
But haven't administration officials said they'll cut the deficit in half by 2008? Yeah, right. I could explain in detail why that claim is nonsense, but in any case, why bother with what these people say? Remember, just 18 months ago they said they'd more or less balance the budget by 2004. Unpoliticized projections show a budget deficit of at least $300 billion a year as far as the eye can see.
The last defense of the budget deficit is that it helps a depressed economy -- to which the answer is "yes, but." Yes, deficit spending stimulates demand -- but tax cuts for the rich, which have dominated the administration's economic program, generate very little employment bang for the deficit buck. Of the 2.6 million jobs the economy has lost under the Bush administration, 2 million have been lost since the 2001 tax cut.
And yes, deficits are appropriate as a temporary measure when the economy is depressed -- but these deficits aren't temporary (see above).
Still, do deficits matter? Some economists worry, with good reason, about their long-run effect on economic growth. But I worry most about America's fiscal credibility.
You see, a government that has a reputation for sound finance and honest budgets can get away with running temporary deficits; if it lacks such a reputation, it can't. Right now the U.S. government is running deficits bigger, as a share of G.D.P., than those that plunged Argentina into crisis. The reason we don't face a comparable crisis is that markets, extrapolating from our responsible past, trust us to get our house in order.
But Mr. Bush shows no inclination to deal with the budget deficit. On the contrary, his administration continues to fudge the numbers and push for ever more tax cuts. Eventually, markets will notice. And tarnished credibility, along with a much-increased debt, is a problem that Mr. Bush will pass along to other Congresses, other presidents and other generations.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: RECONSTRUCTION; 
Wolfowitz on Visit to Iraq To Assess Rebuilding Effort

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 17 

 BODY:
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz arrived here today for a five-day tour of Iraq to assess the Bush administration's successes and shortcomings in the postwar reconstruction effort.
 "I'm here to understand what is needed to complete the transition to a government and society of, by and for the Iraqi people," Mr. Wolfowitz said in brief remarks to reporters traveling with him, at the airport here. 
 In the next several days, Mr. Wolfowitzwill crisscross the country, meeting with allied troops, Iraqi politicians, American occupation officials and others, to get a firsthand sense of what corrections may be necessary in the postwar strategy. His boss, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, visited Baghdad for a day six weeks ago. 
A senior administration official said Mr. Wolfowitz's priorities would include security, the economy and Iraq's emerging civilian political structure. 
The official said Mr. Wolfowitz planned to spend little time talking to officials engaged in the hunt for unconventional weapons, saying that was now a job for the intelligence agencies. A 1,500-member American team headed by a two-star Army general recently assumed responsibility for the weapons search.
On his arrival, Mr. Wolfowitz immediately launched into meetings with L. Paul Bremer III, the senior American civilian administrator for Iraq; Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez of the Army, the allied ground commander; and their top aides.
Speaking to reporters afterward, Mr. Bremer gave a largely upbeat report, saying the newly appointed 25-member Iraqi Governing Council could finish writing a new constitution in the next six to eight months, beginning in September, paving the way for democratic elections.
"You ought to be able to have elections by next year," Mr. Bremer said in an interview at his headquarters here, one of Saddam Hussein's many ornate palaces now occupied by the allies.
Mr. Bremer acknowledged that Iraq had severe unemployment, which he said was much worse than that in the United States during the Great Depression. But he added that the allies were now paying pensions to Iraqi civil servants and stipends to former members of the Iraqi Army, and was taking steps to promote the growth of small businesses and to clear irrigation canals for farmers.
Other allied officials gave a more sobering warning that restoring security, especially in and around Baghdad, and rebuilding Iraq's shattered economy were daunting challenges that would take years. All officials emphasized that the goal was to shift responsibilities to Iraqis.
"Anyone who comes here and thinks this will be an easy ride is mistaken," said Bernard B. Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner who is the senior allied adviser to the Iraqi Interior Ministry.
Mr. Kerik said the number of joint patrols by Iraqi and American security forces had increased to 1,100 a day from about 75 a day when he arrived seven weeks ago.
But he acknowledged that only 4,000 to 5,000 Iraqi police officers had returned to duty in Baghdad, a quarter of what allied officials say this city of 4.5 million people needs. Mr. Kerik added that virtually all of those officers would have to go through a three-week course to learn patrolling techniques and sensitivity to human rights.
Overall, about 32,000 Iraqi police officers have returned to the job, about half of the nationwide goal, which Mr. Kerik said would take at least 18 months to reach.
Sifting through successes as well as disappointments will be one of the main tasks for Mr. Wolfowitz, one of the principal intellectual architects of the administration's Iraq policy.
This is his first visit to Iraq since the end of the major combat and his third over all, counting two trips he made shortly after the 1991 Persian Gulf war. One was to visit troops withdrawing from Iraq, the other to Kurdish areas in the north. A senior administration official said Mr. Wolfowitz had wanted to come sooner but held off to give Mr. Bremer more time to establish his operation.
Mr. Wolfowitz made no publiccomments today about the strains on the nearly 150,000 American troops, nor on the latest audiotape purporting to be a recording from Mr. Hussein.
Echoing comments by officials in Washington, Mr. Bremer said it was essential to provide proof of Mr. Hussein's death or capture. 
It is needed, he said, to reassure a fearful Iraqi citizenry and to deny a rallying point for Baath Party loyalists and other guerrillas, who continue to attack American troops and Iraqis who cooperate with American officials.
"The enemy has been watching us and they've adapted, and we're adapting to them," said Col. Guy Shields, a spokesman for the military command here.
Colonel Shields said the latest series of raids against remnants of Mr. Hussein's security forces had captured 40 senior officials since the operation started on Sunday.
Mr. Bremer said Iran continued to interfere in fledgling political reconstruction, including Tehran s intelligence service. "It's not possible to rebuild a country if a country's neighbor is trying to pick it apart," he said.

HEADLINE: Recession Is Over; Jobs Aren't Trickling Down 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
The recession that began in March 2001 ended eight months later, the National Bureau of Economic Research, an independent group that tracks the business cycle, concluded in a report released yesterday.
 Cheers, if any, were faint. 
 Economists said the announcement was not a surprise, and politicians said it offered little comfort to the millions of Americans without jobs.
"We've declared victory over the recession, and we're still laying off a couple hundred thousand workers a month," said Representative Pete Stark of California, ranking Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee. "If it weren't so painful for so many people who are out of work, it would be hilarious. But it isn't. It's not funny." 
Still, Representative Jim Saxton, Republican of New Jersey and vice chairman of the committee, in a statement called the economic research bureau's decision "a reasonable one."
The recession preceding the recent one lasted from July 1990 to March 1991 in the bureau's chronology. A year after it ended, the nation's economy embarked on six consecutive months of job growth. This time, 20 months after the recession's formal end, payrolls are still shrinking.
"Most households, most individuals, will really not believe that it is a recovery until we see that job growth as part of the picture," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management. But she added, "The official declaration of the end should help confidence on the part of businesses, investors and consumers."
The decision to date the recession's end in November 2001 was made by a committee of seven academic economists after a meeting in Cambridge, Mass., on Wednesday. It was also in November 2001 that the committee declared the recession to have begun eight months earlier. The announcements are typically made long after the business cycle turns up or down, to avoid mislabeling a short-term change as a definite high or low in the size of the economy.
"In retrospect, we could just as easily have made the call a few months ago," said Jeffrey A. Frankel, a professor at Harvard who is a member of the committee.
The 2001 recession is considered short and shallow relative to the nine others since World War II, which averaged 11 months.
In its report, the committee cited the real gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services in the economy, adjusted for changes in prices -- as the primary indicator of a recovery.
Jobs have not followed growth, the committee wrote, because of increases in workers' productivity. In fact, Ms. Reaser said, the unemployment rate is unlikely to fall until the economy expands at an annual rate of 3.5 percent or 4 percent, the sort of pace attained in only two quarters since the recovery supposedly began.
With productivity growing at more than 2 percent a year, and the labor force growing about 1 percent a year, she said, the "hurdle rate" of growth for increasing the share of Americans with jobs cannot be less than 3 percent.
Recessions have often been followed by strong recoveries as pent-up demand, especially for manufactured goods, helped to engender a sort of economic slingshot effect. But in an economy where two-thirds of activity is in services, the usual boost has not been forthcoming.
James E. Glassman, a senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan Chase, said the economy had been largely stagnant because of a series of shocks, including the bursting of the stock market bubble.
"It would take extraordinary bad luck -- new shocks -- to shift us back into recession," Mr. Glassman said. In the committee's announcement, he said, "the subtle message is, 'Get over it; the direction has changed.' "
Professor Frankel insisted, though, that the committee had not made any judgment about the likelihood of a new recession. "This has no bearing whatsoever on the current economic outlook, on the odds of a new downturn," he said.
Some economists remain skeptical of the economy's ability to grow at a strong pace. They think that its tepid performance stems not just from shocks but also from structural factors, like the vast amounts of debt carried by consumers and businesses. If the savings rate increases to help cover those debts, both groups will offer less support to the economy in the near term.
"I still think the private sector's desire to strengthen balance sheets and return to a more normal level of saving is a significant headwind for the economy," said Bill Martin, chief economist of UBS Global Asset Management. "For the economy to grow at a satisfactory rate, given current policies, it would be necessary for the still-low rate of saving to fall over time."
But Mr. Glassman argued that lower costs of debt service, a result of the very low interest rates, were a mitigating factor and an important consideration.
Though he agreed with Ms. Reaser that the research bureau's report might give confidence in the economy a small lift, he also said that the disjunction between jobs and growth could reduce the report's relevance in the public consciousness.
"Most politicians don't actually care about the definitions," Mr. Glassman said. "They care about what people think. In a sense, this isn't going to convince anybody or give them much comfort."

Mixed Data in 2 Reports
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Reuters) -- The Commerce Department reported today that starts of new housing in June were at the fastest pace since January. A separate report said initial claims for jobless benefits fell, but were still at high levels.
Housing starts rose 3.7 percent in June, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.803 million. This was the strongest since 1.828 million in January.
"The insistently strong spot in the economy remains bright," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com. "There's no weakening there. People are still buying homes and developers building them."
But the jobless claims report underscored the lackluster nature of the economy and the national unemployment rate of 6.4 percent.
The Labor Department said new claims fell more than had been expected, to 412,000 in the week ended July 12 from a revised 441,000 the week before. Yet, the report represented the 22nd consecutive week that benefits claims have been above the 400,000 level.

HEADLINE: White House E-Mail System Becomes Less User-Friendly 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
Do you want to send an e-mail message to the White House?
 Good luck. 
 In the past, to tell President Bush -- or at least those assigned to read his mail -- what was on your mind it was necessary only to sit down at a personal computer connected to the Internet and dash off a note to president@whitehouse.gov.
But this week, Tom Matzzie, an online organizer with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., discovered that communicating with the White House had become a bit more daunting. When Mr. Matzzie sent an e-mail protest against a Bush administration policy, the message was bounced back with an automated reply, saying he had to send it again in a new way.
Under a system deployed on the White House Web site for the first time last week, those who want to send a message to President Bush must now navigate as many as nine Web pages and fill out a detailed form that starts by asking whether the message sender supports White House policy or differs with it.
The White House says the new e-mail system, at www.whitehouse.gov/webmail, is an effort to be more responsive to the public and offer the administration "real time" access to citizen comments.
Completing a message to the president also requires choosing a subject from the provided list, then entering a full name, organization, address and e-mail address. Once the message is sent, the writer must wait for an automated response to the e-mail address listed, asking whether the addressee intended to send the message. The message is delivered to the White House only after the person using that e-mail address confirms it.
Jimmy Orr, a White House spokesman, described the system as an "enhancement" intended to improve communications. He called it a "work in progress," and advised members of the public who had sensitive or personal matters to bring up with President Bush to use traditional methods of communications, like a letter on paper, a fax or a phone call.
He said the White House, which gets about 15,000 electronic messages each day, had designed the new system during the last nine months in partnership with a private firm that he would not identify.
"It provides an additional means for individuals to inquire about policy issues at the White House and get a personalized response in 24 to 48 hours," said Mr. Orr, the Internet news director at the White House.
It is still possible to send a traditional e-mail message, he said, but the sender will receive the automated reply and there is no guarantee it will be read or responded to.
Some experts in Internet usability think the new method for sending messages is not doing much to enhance communications between the White House and the public.
"Over all, it's a very cumbersome process," said Jakob Nielsen, an authority on Web design who helps run a consulting group, Nielsen Norman Group, in Fremont, Calif. "It's probably designed deliberately to cut down on their e-mail."
The White House said it was taking its Web usability critics in stride.
"When it comes to a Web site, it's a bit like a movie," Mr. Orr said. "Some will say it's a tour de force; some will say it fell flat."
He said the new procedure provided a straightforward way for a citizen to let an opinion be known and at the same time receive a quick, tailored response from the White House.
Acknowledging that there had been glitches in the first few days, Mr. Orr said the new system was being improved. "Having tried it myself," he said, "I would say it's pretty user-friendly."
But Dr. Nielsen said he found a variety of shortcomings in the White House system, including what he called a deeply buried privacy policy and a lack of indicators marking one's progress in traversing each of the multiple Web page steps. He complained as well about a poorly designed approach to confirming that a message had actually been sent.
The various categories for describing a message's subject are also a big muddle, Dr. Nielsen said.
"One of the categories is 'National ID Card,' " he said. "Does it mean you're in favor of national ID or in favor of the president's position, which it doesn't describe?"
Mr. Matzzie, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. organizer, discovered the new White House e-mail system when he started a campaign to protest the administration's proposals to change the way overtime pay is to be calculated.
He said he particularly disliked being forced to specify whether he was offering a "supporting comment" or a "differing opinion" to President Bush.
"Can't I just say something or ask a question?" he said.
Mr. Matzzie said he was also upset that none of the many categories listed included either "unemployment" or "jobs."
"This is the most ridiculous Web form for contacting someone I have ever seen," said Mr. Matzzie, who is a professional Web site designer.
Having sent his e-mail message on Tuesday, Mr. Matzzie said he was still waiting for a response.

HEADLINE: City Ties Unemployment Services to Needs of Businesses 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is overhauling a city program aimed at helping the unemployed improve their chances of getting a new job. City officials said it was an attempt to improve a neglected city service in which millions of federal dollars have sat idle or have drained away.
 By signing a bill on Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg eliminated the Department of Employment and consolidated worker programs into the Department of Business Services. The bureaucratic shuffle has real consequences for workers, since it will give them the chance to be trained to fit the needs of city businesses looking for workers. 
 "We need to place more of the emphasis on where the growth and opportunities are going to be," said Robert W. Walsh, the commissioner of the Department of Business Services. "If Wachovia Bank is going to open a dozen branches in New York City, we have to say to them, 'What do you need and how can we help you?' There has to be a much more proactive approach to creating jobs."
The change brings New York more in line with the way other large cities handle job training and placement. It also reverses a Giuliani administration policy decision reflecting its skepticism of worker-training programs; it chose to spend little of the federal money available for training the unemployed and to channel some of the dollars to welfare-to-work programs.
The federal money is available through the Workforce Investment Act, passed by Congress in 1998, under which states and localities were to combine the services of government-sponsored job-training programs with unemployment benefits offices by creating one-stop career centers. There, unemployed people could get their benefits, look for jobs and, most significantly, receive vouchers for job training. 
Cities like Boston, Seattle and Austin, Tex., quickly moved to create programs that also served the interests of employers. For instance, in Boston, when airlines began layoffs after Sept. 11, 2001, city job-training officials asked laid-off flight attendants whether they wanted to be radiological technicians, a field with many openings.
New York City never really adopted that approach, and as a result the city's allotment from the federal government began to decrease. The Bloomberg administration moved to spend large chunks of money in its early days before being forced to forfeit the rest, and opened one-stop centers in Harlem and the Bronx. (One already existed in Jamaica, Queens.) Quickly it spent $16.8 million to help workers with special needs, like those just out of prison, and earmarked more than $22 million for vouchers that workers could use to get job training.
The spending has left the city with very little for the next fiscal year; a total of $120 million has been spent and the remaining $8.3 million is already obligated to contractors, city officials said. That may jeopardize the most significant aspect of the program, the vouchers that workers can take to places like the City University of New York or career skills schools. The number of vouchers is frozen, Mr. Walsh said, and other services may have to be reduced. 
The city, meanwhile, has just begun to inform private businesses that it is now in the job-training business.
"Job training is absolutely meaningless unless you have businesses that need them," said Neil Scott Kleiman, the director of the Center for an Urban Future, which has studied workforce issues extensively. "Welfare-to-work traditionally focuses on soft skills such as getting people to show up on time. Workforce is for people who are already in the job market. The cities that have done well with this have opened it up to everyone from the working poor to high-end workers."
By shifting the programs to the business services agency, the city expects that these issues will get more attention and that the federal money will now be fully spent. (Money earmarked for programs for young people was shifted to the Department of Youth and Community Development.)
On a recent surprise visit to the city's one-stop center in Harlem, Mr. Walsh came face to face with both the promise and the shortcomings of the existing program. While the large office was clean, spacious and staffed with polite, well-meaning workers, it was also a bit of a maze. There was no sign in the lobby indicating the location of the center, and Mr. Walsh scribbled notes before he even got upstairs. 
The division between federal services and those being offered by the city was unclear. Unemployed workers perused a job board, which was peppered with mostly low-paying jobs, many of them posted months ago, or watched a job-training video. Others were directed to a room with computers and job-training counselors, who helped them look for work. 
One woman expressed frustration that there were no training vouchers. Mr. Walsh, who was impressed with the center and its director, Henrietta Lyle, said he wanted an organized way for businesses to come in and seek workers. 
"This is better than I expected, and she is terrific," he said of the center and Ms. Lyle, "but I still think we have work to do in terms of getting the business community weighing in."

A new rival to Viagra enlists the N.F.L. to put a masculine face on a sensitive subject.

BYLINE:  By Melody Petersen 

 BODY:
WHETHER they like it or not, football fans will soon be learning all about erectile dysfunction and a new medicine to treat it called Levitra.
 In its first major deal with a pharmaceutical company, the National Football League has agreed that Levitra, which is jointly marketed by Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline, can join its list of corporate sponsors. 
 The multimillion-dollar agreement allows Levitra to use the N.F.L. logo in advertisements and other marketing materials, said Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the league. The N.F.L. and the drug companies also plan to work together on a men's health educational program, he said. 
"They become a partner with the N.F.L.," Mr. McCarthy said.
The deal is a victory for marketers at Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline, who must convince men that Levitra (pronounced luh-VEE-tra) is better than Viagra, the diamond-shaped blue pill introduced in 1998 by Pfizer that has changed how the world views impotence.
If the government approves Levitra in the next couple months as expected, it will become Viagra's first rival. Another new drug, Cialis, could be approved later this year, creating a three-way marketing battle, with each of the companies likely to spend tens of millions of dollars on promotion. All of the companies are trying to reach men through sporting events and prominent sports figures.
"The N.F.L. is our ideal partner," said Nancy K. Bryan, a vice president of Bayer who is responsible for marketing for men's health. "We'll be able to reach 120 million fans each week."
Pfizer already sponsors the Nascar driver Mark Martin, and during many of the races provides a van where fans can receive free health screenings. Viagra is also an official sponsor of Major League Baseball, and Pfizer has hired as a spokesman Rafael Palmeiro, the Texas Rangers first baseman who recently hit his 500th home run. To raise awareness of erectile dysfunction worldwide, Pfizer has hired Pele, the international soccer star.
In 2002, Pfizer spent $87 million to advertise Viagra in the United States, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres.
Cialis, which is marketed by Eli Lilly and the ICOS Corporation, is already sold in more than 40 countries. The drug was a sponsor of the America's Cup in New Zealand in February. Lilly is also a sponsor of the Newman-Haas open-wheel racing team, which includes the actor Paul Newman.
But each N.F.L. game can attract many more television viewers than sporting events like car racing, yachting, or even baseball. According to Nielsen Media Research, more than 15 million people on average watch league football games on the major networks each week, and the Super Bowl is the most watched event on television.
For years, the N.F.L. had refused to allow pharmaceutical companies to join its list of corporate sponsors, leaving the drug makers in the same ranks as producers of hard liquor and firearm makers.
The league decided to change that in February when it told its teams that they could make deals with drug companies.
"We took a hard look at the industry and saw it was one of the most heavily regulated," Mr. McCarthy said. "We have become increasingly convinced that pharmaceutical advertising can occur, and does occur, without violating the rules."
Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline agreed to pay $6 million a year for three years for the N.F.L. sponsorship, according to a report in Advertising Age. One person briefed on the deal said the reported figure was "in the ballpark." Advertising Age also reported that the companies had hired Mike Ditka, the former coach of the Chicago Bears and the New Orleans Saints, to act as spokesman for Levitra in a series of ads.
Both companies said they could not discus the people they had chosen to promote Levitra because they were still completing the details.
Michael Fleming, a spokesman for GlaxoSmithKline, said the companies were "looking for the everyday guy" who would connect with N.F.L. fans and get them to see their doctor.
"Men do need some prodding in seeking treatment," he said.
Marketing experts say that men relate to sports figures, making them effective promotional tools.
"They lend instant credibility to the product," said Michael Kelley, managing director for the New York office of Relay Sports and Event Marketing, which is part of Publicis, the ad agency. "I don't think their primary goal is getting men to go to the doctor. It's about selling their product."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Town House Project Is Set for Bronx

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
Work is to start next week on a 60-apartment rental project for low-income families that will fill the last vacant parcel on a South Bronx block, completing its transformation, begun more than a dozen years ago, into a residential address.
 The $9.9 million project, which is in the shadow of Yankee Stadium and is called Stadium Court, will be added to the 373 rentals in three buildings now on the block, which is bounded by Gerard and River Avenues and 165th and McClellan Streets. It will have 20 factory-built three-story town house-style buildings that will rise in the middle of the block facing Gerard Avenue, four blocks north of the stadium. 
 The apartments will have one and two bedrooms and 690 to 920 square feet. They will be leased to families earning $26,400 to $31,600 a year, depending on family size, at rents of $660 to $790 a month. 
The Leewood Real Estate Group of Staten Island is developing Stadium Court, using public and private financing. The Capsys Corporation will construct the buildings in its factory at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The project's nonprofit sponsor is the Doe Fund, which runs job-training programs and homeless shelters. "There is a dearth of housing for the working poor and working middle class in the city," said George T. McDonald, Doe's president, "and any that we get is to the better." 
Development of the block has reflected how the vagaries of the city's housing market affect the use of public financing. 
The existing buildings on the block, as will be the case with Stadium Court, got some of their financing through the sale of federal low-income housing tax credits to investors who use them to reduce federal taxes. They also tapped the city's tax-abatement certificate program.
The certificates are sold to developers of market-rate housing south of 96th Street in Manhattan. Each certificate entitles such developers to a 10-year property-tax exemption on an apartment.
The housing market was robust in the late 1980's when a developer began to transform the block where Stadium Court will rise. It built a 121-apartment building before the city's housing market declined in the early 1990's and certificate demand fell. 
The federal tax credits for the original development were sold by Related Capital, an affiliate of the Related Companies, a large Manhattan developer. Related also sold the federal tax credits, demand for which is not affected by the housing market, for the three other projects.
After the original building was put up, the rest of the site sat dormant until 1997, when the residential market rebounded, reviving developer interest in city tax-abatement certificates. Related bought the site that year and from 1998 to 2001, in partnership with Leewood, built two seven-story buildings, with 126 rentals each. Gregory H. Gushee, a Related senior vice president, said the 1,260 certificates the two buildings generated were sold to at least 12 developers as well as used by Related.
But when those buildings were completed, the housing market, and by extension the demand for certificates, again flattened, leaving the final site undeveloped until this year.
Earlier this year, Leewood bought Related's interest in the site and got financing for Stadium Court. The financing combines a $2.9 million loan from New York Community Bank with $6.6 million from the sale of tax credits as well as the sale of just 36 tax certificates, generating $360,000.
Last spring, the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development began changing that program to stretch limited resources, said Aileen Gribbin, the department's assistant commissioner for housing finance. 
Developers of low-income housing will no longer automatically get five certificates for every apartment they build. Instead, Ms. Gribbin said, the number of certificates will be based on what other financing the project secures. The changes are expected to take effect at the end of this month, but the city agency was able to negotiate the lower number of certificates with Leewood -- which would have been entitled to 300 certificates under the old program -- because of the availability of other types of financing. 
R. Randy Lee, Leewood's president, said the economics of the project worked thanks to a low interest rate of 5.75 percent on the bank loan. Choosing factory-built modular construction will also save money, as will the project's design, which will not require elevators or common areas, he said. The buildings, designed by LoBue & Valenziano of Staten Island, will have brick facades and will be grouped in four clusters, with five buildings each, around a central courtyard. The project will also have parking for 25 cars. Occupancy is expected in April.

HEADLINE: The Founders And the Fedayeen 

BYLINE:  By Mary Beth Norton; Mary Beth Norton, a professor of American history at Cornell University, is author of "In the Devil's Snare: The Salem Witchcraft Crisis of 1692."

DATELINE: WEST TISBURY, Mass. 

 BODY:
When questioned about the difficulties American forces are having in rebuilding Iraq, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has taken to giving a history lesson. Several times he has spoken of another country in "chaos and confusion" during a period characterized by "looting, crime, mobs storming buildings, breakdown of government structures and institutions that maintained civil order, rampant inflation caused by the lack of a stable currency, supporters of the former regime roaming the streets . . ." 
 This picture should seem familiar to Americans, he says, because it is based on "historians' descriptions of the conditions here in America in 1783." Well, as someone who has spent three decades teaching and writing about that era, I recognize very little of the postrevolutionary United States in Mr. Rumsfeld's depiction. 
 First, the factual problems. His insistence that the new nation had to deal with roving loyalists, "many of whom had fought against the Continental Army," is simply not true. Virtually every person who publicly took sides against the Revolution left with the evacuating British forces in 1782 and 1783, and not just because they feared (with reason) for their safety. Most wanted no part of an independent United States. More than 100,000 refugees ended up in the West Indies, Canada or Britain itself.
Nor did a "breakdown of government structures" lead to widespread theft and looting. Historians have uncovered no evidence of a crime wave in the 1780's; states and localities never descended into chaos. The new states had all drafted constitutions by mid-1777 under orders from the Second Continental Congress. By the early 1780's some of those governments were being reorganized, but they never ceased to function.
Further, Mr. Rumsfeld seems to have conflated the problem of inflation during the war itself -- when the Continental currency depreciated to worthlessness by 1780 -- with postwar circumstances, when the states and national government began to get their finances under control well before the Constitution was drafted.
At least Mr. Rumsfeld is not one of those "revisionist historians" his boss, President Bush, has derided. In fact, the basic interpretation of American history he advances is so ancient it creaks. The idea that America under the Articles of Confederation (from 1781 to 1788) was a time of strife and ineffectual government was first put forward in the 18th century by supporters of the Constitution. It was perpetuated by 19th-century historians who wanted to portray the delegates to the Constitutional Convention as disinterested saviors of the nation. Historians initially challenged this dismal view of the 1780's early in the 20th century, and it has essentially been dead for at least 50 years.
There was, it is true, one major instance of violence in the Confederation years: Shays' Rebellion in western Massachusetts in late 1786 and early 1787. As Mr. Rumsfeld points out, Shaysite mobs did attack courthouses and an armed force assaulted an armory in search of guns and ammunition. But they were not challenging the new nation -- they were opposed only to the harsh taxation and land-foreclosure policies in Massachusetts. The rebels (some of whom had served in the revolutionary forces) saw themselves as protecting "the liberties or properties of the people." Massachusetts rather easily put down the Shaysites, but the legislature then quietly acceded to most of their demands. Nothing in the incident seems comparable to events in Iraq.
This is not to say that the government under the Articles of Confederation was perfect or even adequate. It had many flaws -- most notably, lack of national authority over commerce and taxation. The Constitution was designed to correct those flaws. So today's historical consensus views the Confederation period not as a time of chaotic confusion but rather as a stumbling first attempt to create a viable national government for what had been 13 separate colonies. Thus even if one ignores Mr. Rumsfeld's factual errors, his analogy with today's Iraq seems to hold little water. 
For one, before independence, the American colonies had no unified government: the Revolution and its aftermath created the nation. Prewar Iraq, on the other hand, had a highly centralized economy and government, which has now collapsed.
The United States won its war. Iraq lost. Iraqis must now create a new polity under the supervision of an occupying power. There was no British Paul Bremer sitting in Philadelphia and telling us what to do in the 1780's.
Most important, perhaps, Americans in the 1780's had a tradition of self-governance and civil society stretching back more than 150 years, to the foundation of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1619 and continuing within the individual states. Under Saddam Hussein, any semblance of civil society in Iraq was ruthlessly suppressed for decades. 
As part of his education package, President Bush has proposed an initiative to improve the teaching of American history in the public schools. I wonder if his secretary of defense might benefit from a refresher on the revolutionary era.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW; 
Chef Special Is Product Placement

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

 BODY:
On "The Restaurant," a reality show about a celebrity chef struggling to open his own place in Manhattan, Rocco DiSpirito spends a lot more time in his car than in his kitchen.
 We see Mr. DiSpirito drive his Mitsubishi S.U.V. to his mother's house in Jamaica, Queens. We watch him argue with his publicist while refueling it at a gas station. The camera does not linger on the penne or Mama's meatballs, but we witness his S.U.V. being towed from in front of his restaurant, Rocco's on 22nd Street. 
 "The Restaurant," which begins tomorrow night on NBC, works on two levels. It is an enjoyable, artificially enhanced reality show, a "Real World" for foodies. It also provides a valuable lesson in television economics. Because so many reality shows have lost their novelty and viewers, networks are passing the costs on to sponsors, who use such shows for product placement. NBC calls this kind of reality show "unscripted drama." The scripted part lies in writing advertising artfully into the plot.
Coors beer is the oddest sponsor fit of the three. Few Italian menus offer things like agnolotti alla birra, and Coors is not the brand of choice of many downtown sophisticates. Mostly we see crates of Coors beer being loaded into the kitchen storerooms as the carpenters work frantically to put down the floors and erect new walls before the deadline. (Sometimes the show looks a little like "Trading Spaces.") 
Like Mitsubishi, American Express is an easier fit. The logo is on the "open/closed" sign on the restaurant door, and the filmmakers make the most of a scene on the "soft" opening night, when family and friends were fed free in a dress rehearsal of fine dining. One of the harried new waiters, Gideon Horowitz (he got his job by showing up early for auditions and camping out on the curb with a sign that read "I am not a bum; I am first in line"), informs a customer that there is no more red wine. The customer is appalled. "How can you not have red wine?" he asks, pulling out his American Express card and imperiously instructing the waiter to take it next door and buy four more bottles. (The waiter fails, perhaps because American Express does not want viewers to come away with the idea that it is that easy to use a stranger's card.)
Mr. DiSpirito is a natural reality-show hero: attractive and engaging on camera and an established sex symbol, who has made the list of People magazine's sexiest men. Like the Carrie Bradshaw character on HBO's "Sex in the City," he narrates each episode in a first-person off-camera monologue, "I'm one of those fancy New York chefs." 
He takes the viewer on a tour of his grandmother's tiny red-brick house in Jamaica (actually it is more of a Mitsubishi drive-by) and rather touchingly says that each family meal in the basement there "was like being in Italy." He says his vision is to recreate that cramped, homey spirit in a vast empty space vacated by a bankruptcy proceeding on the corner of Mercer and Prince Streets in SoHo.
Luckily, reality intervenes. Perhaps because no valet is a hero to his master, his financial backer, Jeffery Chodorow, alone seems unmoved by Mr. DiSpirito's charm and enthusiasm. "Rocco, at this point it is not about how much you love the space," Mr. Chodorow, who speaks with the flat, dyspeptic tones of the actor Ben ("Anyone?") Stein, tells him. "It's really not worth the legal problems so let's talk later, O.K.?" He folds himself into his limousine and drives away. Mr. DiSpirito eventually resigns himself to another vacant space in the Flatiron district.
Viewers get a slight taste of downtown flash and dash, but the reality of the restaurant world remains hidden. (Mr. Chodorow and Mr. DiSpirito hope the show will make the restaurant a hit, even if ratings are disappointing.) From George Orwell's descriptions of life as a "plongeur" while down and out in Paris to Anthony Bourdain's expose of gourmet squalor in "Kitchen Confidential," readers hold few illusions about kitchen hygiene and high jinks. NBC viewers' eyes are kept trained on the front of the room -- the flubs, rivalries and romances of the waiting staff and the caprices of customers.
So there is not much insight into the fine art of cooking. We see Mr. DiSpirito flag a little between spritely media appearances. We watch him worry and occasionally lose his patience. But we do not see him prepare food much -- unless one counts an appearance on a local radio station, where the hosts challenge him to concoct a dish from ingredients in the vending machine (he gamely whips up a dessert from candy, coffee and nuts mixed in a blender).
In fact it is not until midway through opening night that viewers have any sense at all of why this engaging young man greeting guests out front is wearing a crisp white chef's jacket.
Then, suddenly, clam orders begin to pile up, a grease fire ignites over the stove, and Mr. DiSpirito hurtles downstairs and snarls obscenities at his sous chefs, shouts at the waiters and hurls plates around. At last, a chef who knows his way around a restaurant kitchen.

HEADLINE: Ford S.U.V.'s Use More Gas Than Before 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., July 18 

 BODY:
The average fuel economy of the Ford Motor Company's sport utility vehicles will be worse for the 2003 model year than the previous year, the company said in a report issued on Thursday.
 Earlier this year, the company said it could not meet a pledge to raise the fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent from 2000 to 2005. But the report indicates that Ford is actually moving backward on fuel economy in its sport utility vehicles. 
 In the 2002 model year, the company's sport utility vehicles were 8.4 percent more efficient than the ones the company made in the 2000 model year. But those produced this year are only 5.2 percent more efficient than those made in the 2000 model year, according to the company's corporate citizenship report. 
The report pointed to declining fuel economy in the company's Land Rover division and declining sales of its small S.U.V., the Escape. It also said fuel economy had been worsened by the introduction of the Lincoln Aviator, a luxury S.U.V. only slightly smaller than the burly Navigator. 
"We were not able to make the investments in the products and technologies needed to meet the goal, nor were some of the technologies as mature as we thought," William Clay Ford Jr., Ford's chairman and chief executive, said in a letter included in the report. 
"But I do reaffirm our commitment to continue to work toward improving the fuel economy of our S.U.V.'s and, indeed, to cutting greenhouse gas emissions across our entire range of vehicles," he said.
The shortfalls in S.U.V. performance were reported today by The Detroit Free Press. 
"They're going backward, not forward, at a time when Americans are acutely aware of the consequences of gas guzzling," said Daniel Becker, a global warming expert at the Sierra Club, a major environmental organization.
David Friedman, a senior policy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: "They were gambling on a market shift to smaller S.U.V.'s instead of putting technology to work to make their mainstream products do better. Instead, their mainstream products did worse."
Three years ago, Ford's pledge was widely reported and helped burnish the green reputation of Mr. Ford, who was then the company's chairman and had yet to become its chief executive. General Motors and the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler responded by saying their S.U.V. fuel economy improvements would at least match Ford's, raising the hopes of environmentalists.
But booming sales of S.U.V.'s depressed the fuel economy of the average new vehicle sold in the United States to a 22-year low in the 2002 model year, the most recent year for which complete figures are available. Since Ford backed away from its pledge earlier this year, G.M. and Chrysler have reiterated that they only said they would at least match Ford's performance, not its promise. 
"Not only have they reneged on that commitment but they're doing even worse this year than last year," Mr. Becker, from the Sierra Club, said of Ford. 
Environmental concerns appeared to be low on the priority list as the company opened labor talks at its Dearborn headquarters today. The Big Three's market share is dwindling and profits are faltering as foreign competitors like Toyota and Honda take more of the United States market. 
For Ford, a top priority will be getting the United Automobile Workers to accept four plant closings in the United States laid out in the company's turnaround plan, including a plant in Edison, N.J., that produces the Ranger pickup. 
"We will need to get the U.A.W. to understand and agree to close the plants we identified," Dennis J. Cirbes, Ford's vice president for labor affairs, said at a news conference. 
The company, which lost $6.4 billion in 2001 and 2002, returned to profitability in the first half of this year. But Ford officials said on Tuesday that they expected profits to be flat in the second half of the year. 
Nicholas V. Scheele, the company's chief operating officer, wrote in an e-mail message to its white-collar workers today that the costs of its salaried work force in automotive operations would need to be cut by 10 percent. He said the cuts would be made through hiring freezes, attrition and less overtime. 
"However, where these actions cannot fully meet the targets, we will have to reduce our salaried personnel structure to address the balance," he added in his message. Ford spokesmen declined to say how many jobs might be cut. The company has about 79,000 salaried workers in worldwide automotive operations. 
"We still face uncertain economies around the globe and a fiercely competitive marketplace," Mr. Scheele said inhis e-mail message. 
U.A.W. leaders have said the preservation of health care benefits is a top priority as costs skyrocket. But analysts and labor experts believe the union will give some ground on other issues. The current contract expires in mid-September. 
Mr. Ford, a great-grandson of Henry Ford, the company's founder, has often been outspoken on issues like global warming, at least by Detroit standards. But he has also been sharply criticized by environmentalists for not making much progress since becoming chief executive in 2001. 
"We can't contribute to a socially, environmentally and economically sound future if we are not successful in executing the basics of our business -- providing desirable, high-quality, affordable products to our customers and doing so profitably," Mr. Ford said in his letter, adding, "the first line of corporate citizenship is being a responsible employer to the 350,000 people who work at Ford."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
U.S. Won't Oppose Japan Efforts to Lower Yen's Value

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 18 

 BODY:
Brushing aside the concerns of many Europeans, the United States Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, said today that the Bush administration would not pressure Japan to stop intervening in the currency market to depress the value of the yen.
 "Japan is going through a tough set of things," Mr. Snow said to reporters here at the end of a four-day trip to Britain and Germany. "As they deal with those things, we're not going to be critical of them at all for their actions." 
 Mr. Snow said that he understood Japan's desire to stanch the rise of its currency to keep its goods competitive in overseas markets. "They need a strong export sector to be able to get their reforms done," he said.
Such words are cold comfort to Europeans, who say their exports are being hurt in those same markets by the powerful rise of the euro. Mr. Snow helped fuel that rally during a previous visit to Europe, when he appeared to abandon Washington's longtime commitment to a strong dollar.
Today, Mr. Snow insisted the United States wanted a strong dollar. But he added, "We're committed to this regime of floating exchange rates."
And he implied that the euro was trading at a proper level. "Where is it relative to where it started?" he asked. "About the same."
The euro has risen nearly 7 percent against the dollar since the beginning of the year, and 11.4 percent in the last 12 months. From its record low on May 27, however, the dollar has managed to rebound 6 percent.
The Japanese government, by intervening aggressively in the market, has kept the yen closely aligned with the dollar since the beginning of the year. A few Asian countries, notably China, fix their currencies to the dollar.
The result, say unhappy Europeans, is that the euro bears a disproportionate share of the pressure of a declining dollar. Some currency analysts said Mr. Snow's remarks could aggravate this imbalance.
"If some currencies are pegged or sticky, because of interventions, others have to appreciate by a higher amount," said Michael Schubert, an analyst at Commerzbank here. "This could be the effect on the euro."
Mr. Schubert said Mr. Snow's remarks would not have as catalytic an effect on the market as his earlier comments about the dollar, because the rally in the euro has ebbed, at least for now.
"People are taking a new look at the dollar," Mr. Schubert said. "The sentiment of the market has changed."
The main message Mr. Snow carried to London and Frankfurt was the need to restore economic growth in Europe. After meeting with Hans Eichel, the German finance minister, and Jean-Claude Trichet, the designated president of the European Central Bank, Mr. Snow said he was convinced that Europe was finally taking the steps to lift itself out of its torpor.
"We are encouraged by what is happening in Germany," he said, praising the tax cuts planned by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder.
While Mr. Snow tried to avoid roiling markets, he tiptoed into another European dispute -- appearing to endorse a call by President Jacques Chirac of France to relax strict restrictions on budget deficits of countries using the euro.
France and Germany have both breached the European agreement, known as the Stability and Growth Pact, which caps deficits at 3 percent of gross domestic product. Last week, Mr. Chirac said the limits should be eased until the economy rebounds. Smaller European countries roundly criticized his remarks, and he was rebuffed by some European finance ministers.
Mr. Snow, however, said: "I commended President Chirac for putting the issue on the table. I think it's important to periodically re-examine rules, to make sure the rules are achieving the intended results."
Mr. Snow noted that the federal deficit in the United States, which is projected to reach $455 billion this year, would violate the European agreement. But he said such a deficit was tolerable during a period of sluggish growth, as a necessary byproduct of an effort to recharge the economy.
"If you're going to have a deficit -- and you never welcome it -- that's the time to have it," Mr. Snow said.

HEADLINE: To Break Logjam, Rowland Urges a One-Year Budget 

BYLINE:  By MARC SANTORA

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 18 

 BODY:
After six months of closed-door negotiations, four weeks of executive orders to keep services in Connecticut running and hours of arguments over what is only a small fraction of a two-year, $13.5 billion state budget, Gov. John G. Rowland said today that the solution was obvious.
 "Here is the answer," he said during an interview in his office in the Capitol building. "All we have to do is sign a one-year budget." 
 And this evening, after at first dismissing the idea as irresponsible, Democrats said they would look at a proposal that would use federal money to balance a one-year budget.
Since 1991, the last time lawmakers failed to meet the July 1 budget deadline, the state has operated on two-year budgets. The thinking was that they would encourage legislators to think about the longer-term consequences of spending proposals and therefore act more responsibly. When the economy was flush, there were the usual arguments, but a lot of money eased the process.
Now, with an uncertain economic outlook, Governor Rowland said that trying to forecast what would happen three months from now, let alone a year from now, was impossible.
In terms of finances, there is not much that separates the Democrats and Republicans in the budget fight. Depending on whose numbers you use, they are fighting over a way to come up with about $100 million.
All the parties agree that, while the specifics are important, the deadlock is largely the result of both sides needing a symbolic victory.
For the Democrats, that would ideally mean some sort of tax that forces the wealthiest people in the state to pay a higher rate on their income. As they see it, Connecticut, as the state with the highest per-capita income but also three of the nation's poorest cities, faces a unique problem. Since towns can only raise money through property taxes, they are largely reliant on state funds.
"The caucus understands the difficulty we are in," said Moira K. Lyons, a Democrat who is the speaker of the State House of Representatives. "We understand the need to reduce our services, but we are right to expect some kind of increase in taxation on the wealthiest to deal with the state's needs."
Since Governor Roland had shown some flexibility on the idea of the so-called millionaire's tax, Democrats raised the idea again in budget talks this week. However, Mr. Rowland said there would not be such a tax in this year's budget. "It's totally off the table now," he said.
Instead, he came back to the idea of simply doing a one-year budget.
"The deal is so close right now, you can see it," he said, holding his hand in front of his face. "The Democrats are not going to cut another 50 million and the Republicans are not going to raise taxes to get another 50 million," he said. "So here is the answer: a one-year budget." He spoke after meeting with Republican lawmakers, who then went into a closed meeting with Democratic lawmakers, where they presented a proposal for a one-year budget.
After the meeting, Democrats for the first time signaled a willingness to look at a one-year proposal. "I still believe it is not the correct way to deal with the problems of Connecticut," Ms. Lyons said. However, she said, the Democrats will study it over the weekend and discuss it with their caucus on Monday. 
"It was very tempting, but not enough to take a bite," said Representative James A. Amann, a Milford Democrat. As part of the proposal, the budget would include $250 million in federal money that would allow the Democrats to restore some programs that might otherwise have to be trimmed.
However, Democrats previously said that they wanted to use that money to help balance the second year of the budget. Some feared that by addressing just this year's problems they would be creating an even larger hole next year -- an election year.
Mr. Rowland seems confident that federal money will come Connecticut's way again next year. Lawmakers say he is likely calculating that as many of the state's powerful politicians, like United States Senator Christopher J. Dodd, face re-election, they will pressure the Bush administration to provide the state with some relief.
But the immediate concern is how to come to some sort of agreement that would allow the state to run without continuing executive orders. Although there have not been the widespread cuts in services that came when the Legislature failed to agree on a budget in 1991, both lawmakers and service providers say they fear that the situation will get worse as the days drag on.
The Democrats' willingness to look at the idea of a one-year plan was the first sign of a break in what has essentially been four weeks of gridlock. After making significant progress to close a budget deficit of around $2 billion for the first year and $2.5 billion for the second year, lawmakers deadlocked over the last $100 million to $150 million. After the Democrats discuss the Republican plan on Monday, the two sides will meet together on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Liberians Grow Impatient With Waiting for Help 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia, July 18 

 BODY:
The thousands who have set up camp inside an American Embassy-owned compound here are hungry, sick, and tired of running. Today, with fresh fighting just six miles north of the city, they are also increasingly tired of waiting.
 The world has promised to help them, they say. Even the Americans, whom they see as their closest kin, have said they will do something. But no one, not American soldiers nor even West Africans who have offered to come first, show any signs of getting here soon. An assessment team was to arrive this afternoon on behalf of the Economic Community of West African States, known as Ecowas, but it postponed its visit until next week. 
 "It's taking too long," said Jefferson Innis, 29, whose home is now a makeshift tent inside Greystone, the embassy storage yard. Greystone is now home to 9,000 to 13,000 destitute Liberians, with newcomers trickling in over the last 24 hours as fighting approached Monrovia once again.
"It's easy for the Americans to put this under control," said Leo Massequoi, 20. "The situation gets worse every day. You should ask Ecowas, 'What's taking so long?' "
"We're in a very dangerous period here, which needs to be shortened very quickly," said Magnus Wolfe-Jackson, the country director for Merlin, the British aid agency. "This purgatory we're living in, we're neither here nor there. It's a period when anything can happen." 
Clashes between government and rebel forces continued for the second day today, reaching closer to the capital and sending the handful of civilians still on the outskirts once again to pack up and flee. Both government forces and insurgents accused each other of having attacked. Government officials said the town of Po River, six miles north of Monrovia, had fallen to the rebel group Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy. The rebels, meanwhile, threatened to advance toward the capital if government soldierskept up their attacks. 
If the rebels carry out the threat, it will be their third attack in six weeks. Since the last two attacks, more than 150,000 people have crowded inside virtually every empty building in the capital, which has become a petri dish of cholera and malaria, hardly a surprise, because there's one toilet for every 2,000 people.
The sound of shelling on Thursday drove a steady trickle of civilians from their homes in the Irongate area north of Monrovia.
American involvement, if any, is likely to be limited to providing logistical support to West Africans.

HEADLINE: Mattel Reports Higher Earnings 

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Mattel Inc. said yesterday that second-quarter earnings edged higher on interest cost savings, even as sales missed analysts' expectations because of intense competition and weak demand for its flagship Barbie and Hot Wheels brands.
 With sales slipping and interest in its marquee brands waning, Mattel is putting its muscle behind several new toybrands, including learning toys and a hip-hop fashion doll. 
 "They haven't been hiding the challenges they're facing, but they definitely need things to pick up in the second half," said Sean McGowan, an analyst with Harris, Nesbitt, Gerard. "The new products are a good start, but it's too early to tell if they'll succeed."
Mattel, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., said earnings rose to $20.9 million, or 5 cents a share, from $19.6 million, or 4 cents a share, in the second quarter of 2002.
Excluding restructuring charges in both years, earnings were essentially flat at 7 cents a share, matching analysts' estimates.
Sales, however, were worse than Wall Street's lowest estimate, falling 4 percent, to $769 million. Analysts had expected sales of $787 million to $815 million, holding even with the $804.4 million reported a year earlier.
Shares of Mattel fell 10 cents, to $19.75 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
In a conference call, Robert Eckert, the chief executive, blamed the tough economy, tight retail inventory and strong competition for market share.

HEADLINE: House Panel Acts on Pension Calculations 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
After Democrats stalked out, a House panel approved legislation yesterday that would provide some relief for companies that offer traditional pensions.
 If enacted in its current form, the bill would allow companies to use a more favorable pension calculation that would save them from having to make tens of billions of dollars in pension contributions over the next three years, according to actuarial studies. 
 The Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee rejected an administration proposal to overhaul the way pension values are calculated. It is a proposal that Treasury officials said would improve accuracy and ultimately increase the solvency of pension plans. The members also rejected a related administration proposal to make companies disclose more information about the health of their pension plans. 
The bill that now goes to the House would change pension calculations in a more modest way and would apply for the next three years. It is at least a partial victory for the business community, which hoped to make this change permanent.
Tension has been running high over pensions this year because the nation's pension funds have fallen on hard times, and strengthening them will cost American companies billions of dollars. 
A three-year bear market has wiped billions off the value of pension funds, and low interest rates have done more damage. Interest rates are used in pension calculations as a proxy for the rate at which a pension fund must grow to pay future benefits; low rates make obligations look very large today. With rates at their lowest point in decades, companies are finding they must make large contributions to keep their plans compliant with federal law. 
Last year, Congress granted companies temporary pension relief, but the measure is set to expire at the end of December. If new legislation is not passed by then, the required contributions will grow even larger.
Companies have lobbied hard in recent months to change a key interest rate used in pension calculations. The statutory rate is linked to the 30-year Treasury bond. Companies wanted -- and got in the committee vote yesterday -- a rate pegged to corporate bonds. Corporate rates are higher than Treasury rates, and using them are to shrink pension debt by billions of dollars.
Bush administration officials and pension advocates have warned that this approach could put workers' benefits at risk. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow has also warned that an improper response to today's pension problems could send the federal agency that insures pensions into a tailspin comparable to the collapse of the Savings and Loan system. 
The Treasury proposed that companies be required to use a range of interest rates, reflecting their workers' ages. Companies with the oldest workers would use short-term rates in their calculations, because their pensions would have to be paid out the soonest.

HEADLINE: Today's Pianos Have Prelude In Yesterday's; 
Steinway Family Legacy Pervades Factory in Queens

BYLINE:  By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
The mechanism that will make the keys on Steinway concert grand piano No. K0862 responsive to the pianist's touch was perfected by Henry Steinway Jr. in the 19th century. He is also responsible for the nearly nine-foot length of No. K0862, which is governed by the layout of the strings that will go inside -- a layout he devised.
 The rim of laminated wood, the cast-iron frame and the hammers that strike the strings -- all were designs patented by one of Henry's brothers, C. F. Theodor Steinway. Another brother, Albert, worked out the mechanism for one of the pedals. A younger relative, Paul Bilhuber, patented the design of the sounding board that will go into No. K0862. 
 Most days, a Steinway can still be found at Steinway & Sons -- Henry Z. Steinway, the great-grandson of the impatient, illiterate German immigrant who founded the company 150 years ago. 
He is also the Steinway who sold Steinway & Sons.
That was 31 years ago. Now, at 87 and long retired from the high-level jobs he once held, he is the last link between the name on the pianos and a business that began as a nights-and-weekends project in his great-grandparents' kitchen-turned-workshop. The original designs, and the innovations of later generations, made the family rich in the days when America was piano crazy and piano-making was big business.
Steinway is making No. K0862 the way it makes all its pianos, according to the designs of Mr. Steinway's ancestors, so the way No. K0862 turns out will depend on manufacturing processes that go back decades. 
But the quality of No. K0862 also depends on Steinway's 450 factory workers, foremen and managers. And they are well aware of who Mr. Steinway is, even if he is not around the factory as much as he once was.
Once he was a kind of Mr. Inside, a familiar figure at the factory, which is on 11 acres of land in Astoria, Queens, that the company has owned since his grandfather's day. His brother John played Mr. Outside, and with the impresarios in Steinway's concert department down the street from Carnegie Hall in Manhattan, hobnobbed with the famous pianists who performed on (and sometimes complained about) the instruments the company made.
Some pianists and piano technicians maintain that Steinway's quality slipped in the 1950's, when Mr. Steinway struggled to consolidate the company's operations. Others say quality sagged after CBS bought Steinway & Sons in 1972 and then announced plans to sell it in the 1980's.
Even Mr. Steinway, who stayed on until he retired in 1980, says morale among workers slipped in those days, and some of Steinway's experienced craftsmen left to start their own piano rebuilding businesses. That made the factory's new managers dependent on less experienced employees and on workers with no connection to the company's past.

Tapping Into a Trend
The kitchen-turned-workroom belonged to a craftsman named Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg, who had already had an unusual, hardscrabble life by the time he started dabbling in pianos.
Born in 1797, he was a survivor. On the run while his father fought in the Napoleonic Wars, he lived through a cold winter that killed his mother and several brothers in their mountain hideout. A few years later, a lightning strike killed his father, three other brothers and two workers from the family's charcoal business. He was nearby, but survived that, too.
A bugler at the Battle of Waterloo, he wanted to be a cabinetmaker when he mustered out of the army, but he balked at the long apprenticeship. He switched to pipe-organ building. Eventually, he tried pianos, and won a prize at a state fair in 1839.
He headed to New York in 1850, changed his name to Henry Steinway and went to work for Bacon & Raven, which made the pianos Stephen Foster played. By then, pianos were important to the national economy. Tallying the figures in 1852, the United States commissioner of patents reported that the piano industry employed 1,900 workers making 9,000 pianos.
Idled by a strike the following year, Henry Steinway and several of his sons incorporated their own piano business during what turned out to be a busy time for such startups. Bechstein and Bluthner, two German makes, are also celebrating their 150th anniversaries this year.
Henry Steinway built his first piano in the rectangular shape popular at the time. One early improvement over pianos of the day had to do with the way the strings were placed above the sounding board: Steinway laid the bass strings at an angle so they crossed over the treble strings. That technique, known as overstringing, meant that the bass strings could be longer than on other manufacturers' pianos. That, in turn, gave Steinway's piano a bigger sound, more like that of the modern grand.
The Steinways made scores of other technical refinements over the years. The family's star innovator turnedout to be Henry's eldest son, C. F. Theodor, who disliked America and spent much of his time in Germany, consulting on pianos with the physicist Hermann von Helmholtz and amassing more than 40 patents.
"It is fair, if not an understatement, to claim that every piano made in the 20th century, except for reproductions of antique instruments, carries the imprint of the inventions of Theodor Steinway," D. W. Fostle wrote in his book "The Steinway Saga." He added in an interview this week, "He defined the architecture of the instrument in a new way, and everybody followed that."
The Steinways' pianos sold fast, and the company built new quarters in 1860 on Fourth Avenue (now Park Avenue) at 52nd Street. A few years later, they opened Steinway Hall on East 14th Street. The company's products filled the lobby. Inside was the city's main stage for classical music until Carnegie Hall opened in 1891.
Before long, the Steinways were headed to Queens, buying 400 acres for the lumber mill they needed for their rims and sounding boards and the foundry they needed for their cast-iron frames.
They also built a company town for their workers, and William Steinway, the fifth of Henry Steinway's six children and the company's first president, tried some nonmusical ventures. He promoted a subway tunnel under the East River and an amusement park where La Guardia Airport was eventually built. The company even struck an alliance with the German manufacturer Daimler that was intended to give Steinway & Sons a foothold in boats and automobiles, as the American affiliate of what became Mercedes-Benz.
"That was William," Mr. Fostle said. "He was visionary, but he was always a decade or two too soon. If he'd been there 10 or 12 years after he was, we'd all be driving Steinways." As it was, Steinway eventually sold its gasoline-powered sideline.

Challenged by Change
So Steinway & Sons was a one-product company when Henry Z. Steinway graduated from Harvard with what he remembers as only vague career plans. "I thought maybe I could try this piano thing," he recalled. "My father" -- Theodore E. Steinway, who had been the company's president since 1927 -- "said, 'Fine.' " 
It was 1937, 11 years after Steinway's biggest year ever (with more than 8,300 pianos made and sold). Steinway had done so well in the 1920's that it had built a second factory, a few blocks from the first. It had also built a new Steinway Hall, a showroom on West 57th Street, steps from Carnegie Hall.
But the Depression had forced the Steinways to close both plants for nearly two years, and the company's future was clouded by another problem. Pianos were no longer a central element of living rooms. Now people wanted radios. Soon, Mr. Steinway recalled in an interview last month, "People would say: 'You're in the piano business? That doesn't exist anymore.' "
Eighteen years later, he was the president of the company, and it was foundering. To save money, he moved the company's administrative operations, and his own office, from Steinway Hall in Manhattan to the original factory in Queens. He closed the second plant after calculating that doing so would lower the company's overhead by several million dollars.
By the late 1960's, Steinway was successful again. But Mr. Steinway was troubled about the future. "It was the hippie time," he said. "Nobody in the next generation . . . "
His voice trailed off without finishing his thought: The fifth generation of the family was not prepared to run the company after he retired. So he arranged a stock swap with CBS that was valued at $20.1 million.
He says his mother considered the deal "a betrayal" and did not tell him before the stockholders' meeting how she planned to vote. (She voted for the sale.) Two of his nephews -- Theodore Steinway Chapin and Samuel Chapin, the twin sons of his sister Elizabeth and her husband, Schuyler Chapin -- wrote to other stockholders, taking issue with his claim that no one of their generation was interested in Steinway & Sons.
Mr. Steinway says he has never regretted the sale, and Theodore Chapin, now the president and executive director of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization, now says it was the right move. He said he had lunch with Mr. Steinway last year and told him that Steinway & Sons "would be out of business" if he had not sold it.
The CBS deal called for Mr. Steinway to remain with the company until he retired, although CBS replaced him as president in 1977, naming him chairman. He gave up that title in 1980, when he turned 65, but never really left Steinway & Sons. These days, he is a kind of good-will ambassador who, among other things, autographs pianos for buyers who want to have the Steinway name in more than just gold letters above the keyboard (he signs the cast-iron plate with a felt-tip pen).
Steinway & Sons has changed hands twice since the sale to CBS. Mr. Steinway says he had been a bit concerned about the most recent sale, in 1995 to Selmer Industries, a maker of band instruments that had been taken over by two investment bankers who had worked for Drexel Burnham Lambert. Under Michael R. Milken, who later pleaded guilty to securities law violations and went to jail, Drexel all but created the market for high-yield bonds that came to be known as junk bonds.
"I thought: 'Here we go up the flue for sure. Two hotshots who're not yet 40 -- this is where we get liquidated for sure,' " Mr. Steinway said last month.
But the two principals, Dana D. Messina and Kyle R. Kirkland, changed Selmer Industries' name to Steinway Musical Instruments. They also took the company public, using the stock symbol LVB. (A Steinway vice president, Michael Anesta, said the company settled on Ludwig van Beethoven's initials because all possible combinations of S's and T's were taken.)

A Rim Is Deemed Ready
The next big moment in the life of No. K0862 came on a Monday afternoon in May. Tommy Stavrianos returned to the hot, dry room where he had taken No. K0862 11 weeks before. Like all Steinway rims, it had been parked there on its end, anchored by an iron frame, aging so it would never snap out of the curved shape into which he and five co-workers had forced it.
Now it was time to wheel it out. A colleague knocked the iron frame off with a wooden paddle. Mr. Stavrianos pushed the rim down a ramp to where other Steinway workers heaved it onto a table saw and trimmed away the rough edges. The result was smooth wood that will eventually be sprayed with black lacquer.
The aging, even the dollying, were done the same way a century ago, when Henry Z. Steinway's forefathers were in charge. The same goes for the wrestplank, the thick chunk of wood also known as the pin block, which will eventually hold the pins that a tuner will twist to adjust the pitch of each note. 
It was installed, with dowels and glue, by Richard Archibald, who has worked for Steinway since 1999. He went to work on No. K0862 on his second day back at the factory after several weeks on sick leave. An accident with a power tool had sliced into two fingers.
He returned to his job in time to finally meet Mr. Steinway. Under a tent outside the factory, all 450employees were given medals commemorating Steinway's sesquicentennial. Mr. Steinway spent more than an hour autographing the cardboard boxes in which the medals -- made by Tiffany & Company -- had been packaged. 
"You know, I'd heard of him," Mr. Archibald said after taking the medal home. "I told him to have strength and happiness the rest of his life."

Invention for 900 Hands
It is something of a mystery. The same 450 workers bend and shape the wood the same way. The sounding boards are made to the same specifications. The strings and pins, hammers and keys -- there should be no variation. 
Yet every piano that Steinway & Sons produces has a unique sound. Some are modest, some monumental. And no one knows why.
This is the third article in a series following one concert grand, No. K0862, as it is made at Steinway's factory in Astoria, Queens. The fourth article will compare that plant to the company's other factory, in Hamburg, Germany, to see how the same basic designs result in very different sounds.

HEADLINE: German Official Says Europe Must Be U.S. Friend, Not Rival 

BYLINE:  By JOHN VINOCUR, International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, July 18 

 BODY:
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany, the leading candidate to become the European Union's first foreign minister under its new constitution, has said in Washington that a strong future Europe must not be developed in rivalry with the United States.
 Rather, he said, Europe can be "strong only together with the United States and not as its rival." He made the statement during a visit to Washington this week in an interview with the Public Broadcasting Service, which was reported by German news agencies; his visit ended today. 
 A German official in Berlin, in response to a reporter's question, said Mr. Fischer's remark was a clear demarcation of the German position on Europe's global role. 
It differentiates Germany's view on Europe's development from that of France, which talks of Europe as a separate power-to-be in a world of competing poles, including the United States, Russia and China.
Mr. Fischer's visit to Washington was his first since the split with the United States over the war in Iraq. He met with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell; Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser; and Vice President Dick Cheney in an apparent effort by both sides to mend the rift over Iraq.
The German position does not reocognize or seek a multipolar world, the official said, but accepts a multilateral one in which issues of importance are decided through discussion and on the basis of international law.
Mr. Fischer returned to Germany today from four days of discussions with members of the Bush administration. The official in Berlin said Mr. Fischer's expressed viewpoint on Europe was a starting point in discussions with all of Germany's allies, including the United States.
The French view, emphasized recently by Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie and Alain Juppe, who heads President Jacques Chirac's Gaullist party, foresees the European Union evolving into an international force that could be defined as a rival of the United States.
Mr. Fischer has made no secret that he wants to become the European Union's first foreign minister. No certain date has been set for creating the post, but it could be as late as 2006.
Although the Americans have no direct role in selecting the foreign minister -- however much their preferences might be noted -- friends of Mr. Fischer confirmed a German news account this month that there have been some signs of reticence in the Bush administration about Mr. Fischer's candidacy.
In an interview with the Public Broadcasting Service, Mr. Fischer also talked of a trans-Atlantic partnership after the Iraq war in which "we must bring all our capabilities together to win the peace." He also restated the German offer of relief efforts and economic help in Iraq.
President Bush and the British prime minister, Tony Blair, expressed concern in April about French visions of Europe's developing into a rival power. That would create instability, Mr. Blair said, urging Europe and the United States to work instead as a one-polar world in tackling problems.
In spite of attempts to thaw American-French relations, high French officials have shown no inclination in the last two months to change their minds. 
Last week, visiting Moscow, Mr. Juppe, who is close to Mr. Chirac, designated Russia as one of the poles and said that the idea of a "strategic partnership between the European pole and the Russian pole" did not exclude "dialogue with the other poles, the American pole, of course, and China." 
Mr. Juppe, a former prime minister and foreign minister, added, "The world of the next decades will function this way" -- creating a situation that would be "much better than a single power ruling over the affairs of the planet." 
The previous month, talking to Chinese military leaders in Beijing, Ms. Alliot-Marie predicted that in a few years Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld will have opposite him a united Europe."
With the remarks Mr. Fischer made in Washington, he seemed intent on making it clear that this was neither Germany's position nor one he would carry forward representing Europe in its foreign affairs.
His position appeared to be in line with a statement by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder in April, when the chancellor pleaded for the primacy of multilateral institutions.

HEADLINE: Going Home, to Red Ink and Blues 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; Nicholas D. Kristof's column normally appears on Tuesdays and Fridays. E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: YAMHILL, Ore. 

 BODY:
Across the nation, state and local leaders have been forced to slash more than $100 billion in spending, laying off thousands of employees, cutting off health insurance for roughly one million people and lowering America's standard of living. Washington is not just aloof from the pain out here in real America, but is making matters worse.
 People across America will pay the price for Washington's indifference in lower-quality schools, fewer chances to go to college, less police protection and diminished medical care. The unlucky ones among us, like Douglas Schmidt, will never recover. A 37-year-old epileptic, he depended on drugs that cost $13 a day and were paid for by the state. State budget cuts meant he lost that benefit, and he ran out of pills in late February. 
 A week later, he had a severe seizure, his heart stopped, and he suffered permanent brain damage, leaving him in what doctors call a "persistent vegetative state." 
"He's very impaired," said his domestic partner, Werth Sargent. "He can't talk. He does not respond to commands. But his eyes do move, and they do constrict when light shines in his pupils. That's on his better days."
The bills so far for treating Mr. Schmidt? About half a million dollars, borne by taxpayers.
When Arthur Schlesinger wrote his "Age of Roosevelt" history books about the Great Depression, his work emphasized that history is not just what Washington decides but also what Main Street endures. While this is no Depression, I came to measure the impact of the fiscal crisis in this little farm town of Yamhill, Ore., population 970. I chose Yamhill not because it is unusually traumatized but because it is a place I know and love -- it's where I grew up.
The schools here were not forced to close early, as in nearby Hillsboro, and as one drives through Yamhill on Maple Street, from one end of town to the other past the single flashing yellow light, there aren't any signs of economic distress. Yamhill even has a new business -- a used car lot, with four cars for sale. But still, there is a real, measurable drop in the quality of life here.
The schools in Yamhill have had to lay off teachers, a bitter and divisive process in a small town like this, so classes -- which averaged 20 students last year -- will be significantly bigger this year. At the high school, the average class in the fall will have 29 students, and there could be 40 in English classes.
"We'll only have two English teachers in the high school," frets the schools superintendent, Dennis Hickey. "We need at least four. I don't know how we're going to do it."
In the 1970's, Yamhill offered not just Spanish but also French (the teacher didn't really speak French but was a good sport and gamely agreed to teach by staying a couple of chapters ahead of us). Next year, Yamhill will be down to just Spanish, and many would-be Spanish students will be turned away.
"We still have a librarian," Mr. Hickey said brightly. "Some schools don't have that any more."
Oregon has been proud of its schools, and it has ranked among the top states in SAT scores. But schools have been hit particularly hard, and universities have been gutted. 
"It's very scary," said Mary Stern, a county commissioner. "I have a 4 1/2-year-old, and I'm petrified about what might happen in the schools."
The county commissioners have been forced to slash programs for teenage mothers, mental health, prenatal care, drug abuse. The county jail's drug program was very successful, but it was dropped -- how could the county help criminals when it cut help for teenage mothers?
A man indicted for stealing and fencing hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of property locally was recently detained in Missouri, but Oregon couldn't pay to bring him back for trial -- so he was freed. In Yamhill's old football rival, the nearby town of Dayton, the entire police department has been eliminated. 
The hub of Oregon is Portland, a gem of a city that has always felt very safe. But Mark Kroeker, the police chief, worries that word is getting out to criminals that because of four consecutive years of police budget cuts, crime pays in Portland.
Police are sometimes forced to issue citations -- like traffic tickets -- to car thieves and burglars because there is no room in the jail, Chief Kroeker says. He adds that one result is that auto theft is up 17 percent so far this year. "We run a serious risk of erosion of our quality of life," he said.
The economy has been in worse shape before in Oregon -- the recession in the early 80's devastated the timber towns -- but the budget problems seem more intractable now than they've been in living memory. The state government is so paralyzed that it still hasn't approved a budget for the fiscal year that began July 1.
Future Farmers of America (now the FFA), which dominated my high school life and taught me more than any class, and remains a pillar of rural America, may now be dismantled at the state level. The traditional county fair, where the Yamhill FFA and 4-H kids show hogs and sheep against one another while their parents compete for blue ribbons for the best berry pie, is in jeopardy because the county isn't able to rescue it if it goes into the red.
What's growing in Oregon is anger.
"This woman was saying to me, People should be on the streets with pitchforks, saying: 'Revolt! Revolt!' " said Ms. Stern, the county commissioner. "There's a groundswell starting. I can feel this energy coming."
Will this fury be directed at President Bush in the next election? I'm not sure. People here complain vigorously about state or local officials, but Mr. Bush seems an afterthought. Still, when the topic comes up, many people are scathing about the Bush administration's spending $4 billion a month in Iraq while letting small towns beg for scraps. 
Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat, thinks that President Bush will have to bail out the states next year.
"There's a presidential election coming up," he said in an Oregon-style interview -- sitting outside in his shirt sleeves on a bench in a public park. "And when the administration feels the hot breath of the public on its neck, they're going to appropriate more resources to the states."
Mr. Kulongoski says that when he and other governors get together, they wonder: what can Washington be thinking?
President Bush is not primarily to blame for this fiscal crisis. The causes include overly enthusiastic spending during the boom years as well as the popping of the tech bubble. But Mr. Bush is making things worse with his fiscal recklessness and his practice of forcing states and school districts to spend money on new programs without helping to pay the bill. Washington should be lending a hand, not adding to the local burden -- showing all the compassion of Marie Antoinette.
If the budget crisis persists, and it is likely to as long as Washington is distracted and unhelpful, towns like Yamhill will lose some of their heart and vitality. And the victims of the budget cuts, like Douglas Schmidt, may never recover. At best, Mr. Schmidt will linger unconscious for decades, breathing through his respirator, costing taxpayers millions of dollars, a monument to America's fiscal crisis of 2003.

Changes to Pension Bill Spur a Political Dispute
More than a dozen Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee -- infuriated by last-minute changes to a pension bill -- left a hearing and holed up in an adjacent library, prompting the committee's Republican chairman, Bill Thomas, to summon the police.
 At issue was a bill that would make changes to federal pension laws, including increasing the amount workers can contribute to their retirement accounts. Page A1. 

The committee approved legislation that would allow companies to use a more favorable pension calculation that will save them from having to make tens of billions of dollars in pension contributions over the next three years, according to actuarial studies. A9.

Coup on Tiny African Islands Felt in Texas Oil Offices

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 18 

 BODY:
A coup this week in the West African island nation of Sao Tome and Principe is reverberating in the corporate suites of the energy industry here, oil company executives said today. Officials from several companies said they were anxiously monitoring events on the potentially oil-rich archipelago, a former Portuguese colony on the Equator in the Gulf of Guinea.
 Exxon Mobil of Irving, Tex., the world's largest oil company, and Chrome Energy, a small Houston-based oil and gas company controlled by Nigerian investors, have secured options for oil exploration in the waters off Sao Tome, an area just south of oil-rich Nigeria that geologists estimate could hold up to six billion barrels of reserves. 
 ChevronTexaco, Royal Dutch/Shell and TotalFinaElf are among the other big oil companies that have shown interest in bidding for licenses to explore other areas in auctions scheduled for October. This interest has sent expectations soaring in Sao Tome and Principe, ae two-island country of 1,000 square miles and 160,000 people where the main export crop is cocoa and the average annual income is $280. 
"Oil has created dreams of grandeur for a tiny place that has been on the margins of global affairs for many years," said Gerhard Seibert, an authority on Sao Tome at the Institute of Tropical Scientific Investigation in Lisbon. "The army and the political and business elites sense something coming and want a part of it."
American and European companies are not the only potential investors in Sao Tome's nascent oil industry. Nigeria has a treaty with Sao Tome establishing a joint development zone in waters off both countries, allowing 60 percent of the revenue from the area to go to Nigeria. And Sonangol, Angola's state-controlled oil company, has reached a preliminary agreement to train Sao Tomean oil officials and invest in future projects.
It remains to be seen how the coup leader, Maj. Fernando Pereira, will treat existing agreements. He agreed to talks today with representatives from the United States, the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries and Nigeria, in one of the first indications that tensions could ease.
Still, most cabinet members, including the oil minister, Rafael Branco, were being held captive today, adding to uncertainty over the effect the coup may have on oil exploration. The coup has already affected Sao Tome's fragile economy: The World Bank said this week that it would suspend all aid to the nation as long as the coup leaders remained in power.
"Our contracts are with the government of Sao Tome, so we're assuming that they will be honored no matter what takes place," said John Coleman, director of investor relations at Chrome, a publicly traded company whose formal name is Environmental Remediation Holdings Corporation. But, he also said, "It's too early to tell what's going to happen."
Marcia Zilensky, a spokeswoman in Houston for Exxon Mobil, said the company was "closely following the situation like everybody else." Exxon Mobil has yet to start operations in Sao Tome.
No oil is expected to be extracted from Sao Tome until 2007 or 2008, but the country has nonetheless become a international flash point, leading experts on West Africa to speculate it was only a matter of time before jostling for power ahead of the oil rush would evolve into political instability. Revenue from licensing agreements alone could reach $200 million in the next two years, an amount about four times the size of the national budget.
"Sao Tome is a microstate with limited capacity to absorb a big influx of cash," said Stephen Harrison, director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "It's also in a neighborhood with two very muscular players, Angola and Nigeria, opening the door for runaway competition for its resources."
President Fradique de Menezes of Sao Tome was in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, when Major Pereira led the apparently bloodless putsch on Wednesday. He accused the mutinous troops of being influenced by "the smell of oil." He has remained in Nigeria.
James Burkhard, an Africa analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said investors were expecting the coup to collapse in the face of international pressure much in the way a similar power grab in 1995 dissipated after Angola stepped in to mediate between parties.
"The age of oil is upon Sao Tome, so some level of friction is to be expected," he said.

SIX FLAGS SAYS WEATHER HURT SALES IN FIRST HALF

BYLINE:  Reuters

 BODY:
 The theme park operator Six Flags warned that bad weather and the slow economy led to a 4 percent decline in attendance in June and that first-half revenue would trail that of the period a year earlier. 
Attendance in the four weeks ended June 29 fell to 7.3 million from 7.6 million a year earlier, the company said after the close of trading on Thursday. The parks' adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization will be $19 million to $20 million, a drop of $30 million to $31 million from the year-ago half. Shares in Six Flags, which is based in New York, fell $1.14, or 18 percent, to $5.09.

HEADLINE: Confidence Survey Shows Increasing Optimism 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer confidence rose this month as a measure of current economic conditions increased to its highest level in more than a year, a University of Michigan survey showed yesterday. 
 The university's preliminary July sentiment index rose to 90.3 from 89.7 last month. 
That was the third rise in four months. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks has risen 22 percent since a low in March, which may have contributed to higher confidence this month, economists said. 
 Lower interest rates and prospects of tax cuts may also be increasing optimism, paving the way for stronger consumer spending and growth that is needed before companies feel confident enough to resume hiring. 
"What we are going to have is good growth, but it's not going to be a boom," said John Silvia, chief economist at the Wachovia Corporation in Charlotte, N.C. "Consumers still have a lot of concerns out there. I don't see how consumers are going to write off the war or write off the job problem." 
The current conditions index, which reflects the perceptions of Americans of their financial situation and whether it is a good time to make major purchases, rose to 102.1, the highest point since May 2002. It was 94.7 in June. 
The second half of the year "will be significantly better than the first half," Thomas Dattilo, chief executive of the Cooper Tire & Rubber Company, the nation's second-biggest tire maker, said in an interview yesterday. "There is going to be more money in consumers' pockets; the tax cuts will make sure of that. We certainly see an improved sentiment out there in retail."

HEADLINE: Talk, but Talk Tough 

BYLINE:  By Ian Bremmer; Ian Bremmer, a senior fellow at the World Policy Institute, is president of Eurasia Group, a research and consulting firm.

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was upbeat this week about resuming direct diplomatic negotiations with North Korea. After months of wrangling, a meeting with the North Koreans and China is all but settled.
 Anyone expecting a breakthrough, however, is likely to be disappointed. On the contrary, a better understanding of Pyongyang's intentions should lead the Bush administration to toughen its stance with North Korea. 
 The most surprising aspect of the North Korea crisis is not how much trouble the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, has instigated, but why he waited so long to make it. After all, it was January 2002 when President Bush's State of the Union address included North Korea in the "axis of evil." Yet North Korea escalated the conflict only in December, when it started to reactivate its nuclear facilities. Why the delay?
In part it may be because North Korea took time to realize that its relationship with the United States was deteriorating. Pyongyang is used to hearing threats from Washington -- and responding in kind -- while business as usual continues. After all, the State Department has named North Korea a "state sponsor of terrorism" for years, but with little effect on the Agreed Framework among North Korea, the United States, Japan and South Korea. That accord, signed in 1994, resulted in the freeze of North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for food aid and fuel.
But the better explanation for the delay is that North Korea was afraid that the winner of the South Korean presidential election in December would be Lee Hoi Chang. A victory for Mr. Lee would probably have been the end of South Korea's "sunshine" policy of engagement with the North, and North Korean leaders would have been forced to deal with the additional burden of a newly skeptical government in the South. Sudden provocation from Pyongyang could well have pushed Mr. Lee toward victory. When Mr. Lee's rival, Roh Moo Hyun, won the presidency and continued the sunshine policy, North Korea turned its full attention to the United States.
In meetings with American officials in Beijing in April, North Korean officials offered insight into their concerns. They offered to freeze all present nuclear programs in return for American security guarantees. They also wanted economic aid and normalization of relations.
This revealed the central objective of the North Korean regime: its own survival. Thus the North's bargaining chips are limited to the development of weapons of mass destruction and the threat of proliferation. The strategy is almost always the same. Mr. Kim repeatedly calls attention to the danger of the regime without taking any action that might result in regime-threatening retaliation.
Accordingly, America's worries should not focus on Pyongyang's lobbing a nuclear bomb toward Tokyo or sending a million troops across the border to Seoul. Either of these actions would bring about the end of the North Korean regime -- and Mr. Kim knows it. America is not, as former Secretary of Defense William Perry warned this week, on a "path to war."
Instead, North Korea is a threatbecause Mr. Kim needs more money to stay in power, and so will do what he can to get it. To this end, North Korea has become one of the world's most aggressive exporters of drugs and ballistic missiles. If that commerce turns to nuclear technology, Mr. Kim will fuel a crisis of global proportions.
Understanding this, the Bush administration continues to demand a verifiable end to all nuclear development in North Korea. Administration officials have disagreed over whether negotiations should be supplemented by military escalation. The recent announcement of a realignment of American troops in South Korea, moving them from the demilitarized zone and out of harm's way, was a victory for advocates of escalation.
It was a logical move. Even with some cooperation from China (North Korea's main source of aid), multilateral talks have not produced results. They are not likely to. By negotiating, Mr. Kim can play for time, conceding nothing while pursuing unmonitored enriched-uranium programs. Slowly but surely, his bargaining position would improve. But escalation will force him to make concessions.
Stepping up the military pressure also gives China a further incentive to help change North Korean behavior (and perhaps even offer North Korea security guarantees should it choose to cooperate). If that doesn't work, and brinkmanship proves necessary to bring North Korea into line, Mr. Kim is likely to blink first.
The Bush administration has made it abundantly clear that it would welcome regime change in North Korea. But this is an unrealistic goal. Furthermore, talk of ending Kim Jong Il's regime is counterproductive to what should be America's main objective: the verifiable removal of all nuclear capacity from North Korea. A policy explicitly focused on this aim, backed by the real threat of military escalation, is the best approach.

HEADLINE: Opinions on Economy Are Easy; Proof Is Tough 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
In the debate about tax cuts and federal budget deficits, both sides are making arguments that can never be proved.
 After the White House announced forecasts for record deficits on Tuesday, Democrats rushed to accuse President Bush of guaranteeing future cuts in Social Security and Medicare benefits. They have also asserted that the disappearance of $6 trillion in federal surpluses will push up long-term interest rates and dampen spending by consumers and businesses. 
 But because there is no second chance at history, Democrats can only guess at what might have been had the policies of the Bush administration not been enacted. 
Similarly, Republicans have contended that the tax cuts they pushed will generate millions of jobs that would not otherwise have existed. But that contention, like the eventual outcome for the economy, can only be compared against an unknowable alternative.
"We're in the middle of an experiment right now," said John H. Makin, director of fiscal policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a research group. He joined other economists in saying there may be some truth to all three notions -- the higher interest rates, the strain on federal programs and the extra jobs -- but to what extent depends largely on the frame of reference.
"A lot of it's just this issue of long term versus short term," said David A. Wyss, chief economist of Standard & Poor's. "There's less disagreement in many ways on the impact than there is about whether you should be focusing on the impact in 2004 or in 2010."
Over the next few years, according to the White House, the nation will face deficits so big they would be illegal in the European Union. But on Tuesday, Joshua B. Bolten, the White House budget director, took issue with the idea that they will turn into long-term fiscal disaster. He said the three waves of tax cuts passed by Congress would result in stronger economic growth and a narrowing of the deficits.
If the economy does begin to expand faster, however, there will be no way to prove that the tax cuts were mostly responsible. Dozens of other factors, from exchange rates and oil prices to technology and innovation, can wield separate, significant influences on the economy.
Yet the administration made its case on that account, too, in a statement sent by e-mail the same day from Rob Nichols, the Treasury's chief spokesman: "By the end of 2004, had there not been the fiscal stimulus measures proposed by President Bush: The unemployment rate would be as much as 1.6 percentage points higher. The economy would have created as many as 3 million fewer jobs. Real gross domestic product would be as much as 3.5 to 4 percent lower."
Mr. Nichols' statement offers especially small grounds for comparison because the nation has not even had its first chance at history in 2004. But even at the end of next year, there will be no way to show that Mr. Nichols, or the computer model of the economy on which his statement was based, was right.
For one thing, that particular model always predicts that cuts in income tax rates lead to increased job creation, said Ben Herzon, senior economist at Macroeconomics Advisers, the consulting firm in St. Louis that designed the model. The existence of a link between taxes and jobs is one of its assumptions, not one of its conclusions, Mr. Herzon said.
The extent of that link is a subjective matter, said Edmund S. Phelps, a professor of economics at Columbia University.
"In general, much depends upon the structure of the tax cuts," he said. "So far I'm coming down cautiously on the side that cutting the dividend tax rate would have a positive effect on employment." But, he added, "I'm not convinced that across-the-board income tax cuts would be strongly expansionary for employment."
Critics of the White House have asserted that rising budget deficits will hamper any economic recovery by leading to higher interest rates, a situation that Professor Phelps said concerned him as well. Most first-year economics textbooks teach that higher government deficits do result in higher long-term interest rates, all other things being equal. The extent of the connection, however, is far more controversial.
The case in favor again depends on mathematical models based on the economy's past performance, which were recently surveyed by William G. Gale and Peter R. Orszag, fellows at the Brookings Institution, a research group. They posed a situation in which forecasts for annual budget deficits increase by 1 percent of gross domestic product -- roughly the difference between the White House's new estimates and the Congressional Budget Office's predictions for 2003 through 2008, made in March.
According to the studies, if such a change affected expectations for deficits for a long time, it might raise the yield on 10-year Treasury notes up to 1 percent, with an average estimate of about 0.4 percent. Compared with expectations two years ago, when the Congressional Budget Office forecast $2.9 trillion in surpluses between 2003 and 2008 instead of $1.4 trillion in deficits, as the White House now predicts, the average estimate would be much greater: an increase of as much as a 2.3 percent in the 10-year yield.
In response, Republicans and skeptical economists have pointed out that long-term interest rates are extremely low by historical standards, even with the huge change in the government's fiscal position. The yield on the 10-year note hovered around 4 percent yesterday. Would it have been at 1.7 percent, were it not for the White House's tax cuts?
"I can't prove they wouldn't have been lower, but I'm of the school that deficits and interest rates are not strongly related," Mr. Makin said.
In his testimony before the Senate on Wednesday, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, also gave a cautious answer. "It's not clear to me to what extent changes in yields are impacted, although there's no question that if you put new securities in the market, prices will tend to adjust," he said. But he added that he was a "firm believer" that there was, indeed, some effect.

Key West Debates Impact of Cruise Ships

BYLINE:  By EDWIN MCDOWELL 

 BODY:
THE first regularly scheduled cruise ship to call at the Port of Key West arrived in 1969. But not until 1984, when the city upgraded its dilapidated dock at Mallory Square, did Key West have a dock suitable for the larger ships that were already transforming the cruise industry. 
 In the years since, the decision to open its docks to cruise ships has paid dividends for the approximately two-mile by five-mile island with a population of about 27,000. In the 2002 fiscal year, 927,740 passengers stopped for the day in Key West (cruise ships are not permitted to stay overnight), up from 662,910 in 2000. The combination of port fees levied on the ships, the $8 passengers pay to disembark and passenger purchases in town have all helped to provide jobs in Key West's vital tourist economy. 
 But not everyone is pleased with the recent dramatic increase in both ships and passengers. Those numbers, last year's especially, seemed to evoke more complaints than ever from residents, environmentalists and longtime visitors. Cruise passengers, they say, jam the streets, cause long lines at restaurants and attractions, and otherwise threaten to diminish if not destroy the city's laid-back style. As a result, Key West residents are divided over whether the city should reduce the number of cruise ships or allow the same number as last year. The complaints are unlikely to subside if the city's projections for this fiscal year are borne out -- namely, that 576 ships, or 107 more than last year's record, will arrive in Key West, bringing 1,073,036 passengers, or 145,000 more than last year . 
The mayor of Key West, James Weekley, said in a telephone conversation that it is important to protect the island's quality of life and marine environment. "I occasionally get e-mails or letters from visitors who have been coming here for years who say we need to control the numbers of cruise ships and their passengers, because Key West is losing its charm," he said. Yet while acknowledging that the city and the cruise industry need to strike a balance, the mayor added that it should not come at the expense of jobs, established businesses or businesses that started up because of the cruise ship visits. 
Amy Lachat Lynch,the president of Last Stand, a Key West environmental organization, said, "It isn't that cruise ships or the people who arrive on them are bad, but we're concerned about the economic impact of the number of people who come here from almost everywhere and won't come back because of those crowds." 
Joseph and Marlyn Brita, Maine residents who flew to Key West late last spring for a two-week vacation, their first visit to the key, were well aware of the crowds when three ships with about 7,000 passengers were in town at the same time, but they were not particularly bothered by them. 
"It's a small town but there are a million things to see," Mr. Brita said, citing the Hemingway House, the Aquarium and the Harry Truman Little White House Museum. "But if they increase the number of ships that come here I can see where it will be a problem." 
Peter Ilchuk, president of the Key West Lodging Association, agrees with residents who want the city to impose limits. "Key West is very small," he said, "and when you bring in 7,000 to 10,000 passengers on a given day, it's bound to change the nature of the destination."
Both the city and the cruise industry say they are looking for ways to do a better job of spreading out the congestion that occurs at Mallory Square, where two of the three cruise ship piers and many of the best-known restaurants and shops are situated. The city is financing research at Florida International University to determine how to assess the impact of cruise ships on the environment, Key West's economic base and its quality of life. 
Meanwhile, critics of the influx of cruise ships have other suggestions. According to Elliot Baron, a former president of Last Stand, "The only option left for the city to manage the ever-increasing appetite of the carnivorous cruise ships is to regulate supply and demand via the disembarkation fee." 
Last month Mayor Weekley proposed that the City Commission impose a surcharge on cruise ships to help offset the cost of providing security while they are at the city docks and an additional fee atop the current $8 passenger debarkation fee. Although the commission has approved both proposals, it has not decided what either fee should be.
The mayor also proposed that while cruise ships are at city docks, they be required to pump out sewage through a hose into the sewer, that they not use incinerators, and that they refrain from playing music or making announcements over the ships' on-deck loudspeakers. 
But without actual limits on the numbers of ships stopping in Key West -- and so far such limits are only in the talking stage -- Mr. Ilchuk of the lodging association said he fears that "we'll find ourselves no longer a charming port city but just another cruise port."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Wallkill, N.Y.; 
An Aging Plaza Gets a New Look and New Tenants

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
FOR most of the 1990's, the three-level 1.1-million-square-foot Orange Plaza in Wallkill, N.Y, loomed big and empty on its perch along Route 17, visible to most motorists heading north to the Catskill Mountains.
 Now an indoor mall on a 90-acre site, built in the 1970's, is nearing the end of its transformation to a fully occupied 900,000-square-foot two-story open-air shopping center. The work, done by new owners over the last two years, included razing all but 245,000 square feet of the mall and adding a major new section. The anchors of the new center, which is retaining its old name, are value-oriented tenants like Wal-Mart, rather than traditional department stores, like Sears, which anchored the old mall. 
 The new Orange Plaza also has an unusual two-level design. The bottom level faces Route 17 while the top one faces Route 211 in this Orange County town, about a 70-minute drive from Manhattan. 
"It's essentially two centers in one, with two front doors," said Richard A. Baker, president of the National Realty and Development Corporation of Purchase, N.Y., the project's developer. Robert C. Baker, Mr. Baker's father and National's chairman, said his company bought the site for $25 million and injected $50 million more to turn it around because "it was the best location in a very strong retail market." In addition to being on Routes 211 and 17, the center is a mile from Interstate 84.
Industry professionals say the turnaround of Orange Plaza, which is to be completed this fall, demonstrates that in a region where large tracts of land are scarce and expensive the redevelopment or expansion of well-located centers is becoming as common as building new ones. There is also the move back to open air centers, which allow consumers to focus on a specific shopping mission and carry it out quickly, said Patrice A. Duker, a spokeswoman for the International Council of Shopping Centers in Manhattan. 
When the old Orange Plaza opened in 1971, it was the first big retail center in Orange County. Its popularity remained high through 1991 when the one million square foot Galleria at Crystal Run opened across Route 17 from Orange Plaza. 
The newer mall's opening doomed the older center, whose tenants fled. In 1995 Orange Plaza was a virtual ghost town and that same year the lender, GE Real Estate, a division of GE Financial of Stamford, Conn., worked with the mall owner to turn around and market the property. 
OVER the next five years a portion of the mall at its western end that formerly housed Sears was razed to make way for a 129,000-square-foot Kmart. On the southern end land that had been a parking lot was leased to Home Depot to build an 116,000-square-foot store. 
Despite those efforts the mall remained mainly dormant and unsold. Ultimately, GE took back the title of the property and sold it in 2001 to National Realty, which owns 14 million square feet of shopping centers in the eastern United States. "It made strategic sense to sell to a company with experience," is all Dan Whitney, global communications manager for GE Real Estate would say of the transaction. 
Richard Baker said his company had acquired Orange Plaza not only because it considered it to be in a prime location but also because it knew how to reconfigure the center and fill it with tenants to complement the Galleria at Crystal Run, not merely to compete with it. Many of the tenants added were large-area discount stores. He said by the time construction began on the new center in March of 2001. most of the space was leased. 
Besides Wal-Mart, which occupies 228,000 square feet, the new tenants included Kohl's, the discount department store, which took 89,000 square feet. Among the smaller anchors are Bed, Bath & Beyond and Staples, each with 30,000 square feet. 
The rest of the space is leased to smaller tenants and restaurants; there will be a total of 30 when all of the tenants are in place. The average rent is more than $20 a square foot annually. Ms. Duker of the shopping center council said what National Realty did was "take what was missing in the mall and put it in Orange Plaza."
Nearby there are about six strip shopping centers, including one directly behind Orange Plaza, so that the southeastern sector of Wallkill is a sort of retail hub, home to most of the 4 million square feet of retail space in the 64-square-mile town. There are also two strip centers on the southwestern end of town bordering Middletown. 
Recent years were a time of carnage for owners of some older shopping centers in Orange County as newer retail centers were built and a limited number of new retailers like Target and Kohl's entered the region, said Dale Mulartrick, manager of the leasing department at the Levin Management Corporation, a retail management firm in North Plainfield, N.J. His company, citing figures from the Shopping Center Directory, put the overall retail vacancy rate at 10 percent in the Wallkill market. 
Orange Plaza, Mr. Mulartrick said, makes sense because "the developer was able to capitalize on a still solid location and match it up with big-box candidates."
Robert Baker said Orange Plaza currently does about $250 million in sales a year with some spaces still to open. "It's like the jungle and the survival of the fittest," he said. "The sales go to the strongest retailers with the major draw." 
Richard Baker said the project also makes sense because some 113,000 people with an average household income of $61,706 live within a 10-mile radius of the redevelopment. Despite the slack economy, he added, most discounters, like many in Orange Plaza, continue to do well.
Still, in April Kmart, which last year filed for bankruptcy protection, canceled its lease at Orange Plaza. That 129,000-square-foot space is being carved up for several tenants. The largest is Burlington Coat Factory , which took 80,000 square feet. Completion is set for October. 
John Ward, Wallkill's supervisor, said that Orange Plaza's rebound is a benefit to the town, where retail is a major contributor to the tax base. He said the annual tax revenue generated to just the town by the refurbished center is $187,000, up from $35,000 annually from the old center.
Also significant, Mr. Ward said, is that the new center fits and is what the town wants to see on the site. Because of its location near three highways there were only minor road improvements necessitated by the project, and replacing the old center, which contained asbestos, with a modern one improved the area, he said.
The decision to retain the name Orange Plaza is not questioned by the property's tenants, despite the years that the center struggled. A case in point is Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., which moved last year to Orange Plaza from less than a mile away, and in the process, doubled its space to 228,000 square feet.
"We already had a presence in the market so our customers are not confused by the name," said Michael Gardner, real estate director for Wal-Mart's eastern region. "Our major focus in making the move was to get the store closer in size to a supercenter and we couldn't grow to that size at the old location." 
He said the larger store offers customers such additional offerings as a 60,000-square-foot grocery.
Its name may be familiar. But the design has been changed. The new Orange Plaza has a 40-foot-high facade accented with 16-foot-high metal grill and, at night, it is awash with lights and color, gives motorists driving north on Route 17 something different to view.

Your Brain on Stress: An Unfocused Picture

BYLINE:  By EILENE ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
THE link between stress and heart disease has affected thousands of patients of Dr. Eddie Erlandson, a vascular surgeon and the former chief of staff at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich. 
 But two years ago, Dr. Erlandson noticed another kind of link -- between chronic stress and the job performance of many of his patients, particularly executives. 
 Many of those patients complained that they lacked clearheadedness and were making bad decisions at work. "They knew how stress was affecting them physically but were completely unaware of the toll it was taking on them mentally," he said. So he has left his medical practice to team up with his wife, a psychologist who had been running a company to train executives in how to reduce stress. Theirs is one of a crop of companies committed to helping senior managers cope.
Psychologists say many executives can thrive on stress, in moderate amounts. But the sluggish economy, widespread layoffs and heightened scrutiny of senior executives are combining to raise the stress levels in many senior-level jobs.
Relentless stress causes the body to respond as it does in an emergency, with a "fight or flight" response, said Dr. Redford Williams, who studies stress as part of the psychiatry department of Duke University Medical Center. "That response causes the hormones cortisol and adrenaline to be released, the sympathetic nervous system to fire off and the heart to pump four to five times more rapidly," he said. "Blood is shunted away from organs into muscles. When you are in this mode a good deal of the time your brain is scrambled, your thinking process doesn't work well, your judgment is clouded. It's very difficult to think clearly."
Doctors say it is hard to measure blood concentrations of stress hormones, but studies in animals have shown that elevated levels of these hormones are linked to an inability to think in a clear and focused way, said Dr. Bruce S. Rabin, medical director of the Healthy Lifestyle Program at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. "Anecdotal information -- which comes from engaging individuals in high-stress conditions and then in behaviors that lower the concentrations of these hormones -- shows that lowering the concentration greatly increases a person's efficiency and focus, and lowers anxiety," he said. "This is especially significant for executives."
Chronic stress, or distress, is also linked to short-term memory loss for people in their 40's and 50's, a phenomenon long associated with people in their late 60's and 70's.
A lack of focus and clarity can play a part in poor decision-making. In addition, the brain normally uses memory to recognize patterns in information it receives, but chronic stress puts pressure on the brain to save energy and to go through only a minimal amount of information before believing it has recognized a pattern, said Dr. Susan Battley, a psychologist in New York who coaches and advises senior executives.
Under intense stress, executives think they recognize what is happening in a situation and make premature decisions, she said. "Since most executives are hard-charging by nature," she said, "they generally aren't aware of distress and don't see that the quality of their decisions and actions isn't what it used to be." 
TO help executives deal with stress, many companies and therapists now offer a range of techniques for recognizing it and keeping it at bay. Through their company, Worth Ethic, based in Carpinteria, Calif., Dr. Erlandson and his wife, Kate Ludeman, teach executives to identify problems in behavior patterns and to neutralize them.
Others use technology to help executives manage stress. HeartMath, a training and consulting firm in Boulder, Colo., has software that lets users see their heart rhythms in real time. When the rhythms go from smooth to chaotic, the users learn to use strategies like deep breathing and positive imagery to alleviate stress. "Most executives are numb to it and don't realize how stressed they are," said Bruce Cryer, the company's chief executive.
Gunder Creager, a senior vice president of Colliers International, a commercial real estate brokerage company in San Diego, tried a stress management program from HeartMath this year. He has been paid entirely on commission for 19 years, a situation he describes as extremely stressful. 
After trying HeartMath's stress reduction techniques for several months, Mr. Creager said, he has become more effective at work. "I think I make better decisions now," he said. "My mind just feels clearer. When I'm stressed, everything narrows down and I focus on one thing, rather than the big picture."
Elizabeth Hall, now a vice president of human resources development at Liz Claiborne, first noticed the effect of stress on performance several years ago. "I felt the weight of too many demands," she said. "I didn't listen deeply to what people were saying; I couldn't act decisively. I was paralyzed by contradictory demands and messages. And I couldn't be proactive because I was too concerned about risks."
Ms. Hall started using stress reduction techniques from HeartMath and other sources. Now, she says, "I use all the pieces of my intelligence -- intellectual, emotional, organizational, behavioral and intuitive -- in making decisions."
Some executives use their own methods to try to keep stress in check. One design executive at Mattel uses a sound chair, where she and her design team take turns listening to a series of CD's intended to reduce stress and to leave the brain more conducive to creativity. 
Some experts say intense bursts of severe stress can be beneficial, but only if they are followed by periods of complete disengagement from the stressful situation. Tony Schwartz, co-author with Jim Loehr of "The Power of Full Engagement" (Free Press), suggests limiting exposure to stress to 90 to 120 minutes and then switching gears for at least 5 to 10 minutes to help the body and brain recover energy. "You simply can't be fully engaged 24 hours a day," Mr. Schwartz said. "Our bodies are begging us for a chance to recover."

HEADLINE: By Telecommuting; the Disabled Get a Key to the Office, and a Job 

BYLINE:  By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU

 BODY:
JANET PEARCE, a producer at NBC News, was diagnosed with muscular sclerosis nearly a decade ago. But she has rarely missed a day of work even as her illness has progressed, making her unable to walk. A vital reason she has remained gainfully employed is telecommuting.
 About two years ago, NBC gave Ms. Pearce the option of working at home when she needed to, and today she splits her time, spending three days a week at the office and two at home. After 36 years at NBC, Ms. Pearce said she could not imagine leaving her job, even when she found herself overwhelmed by her disease, her medical appointments, the physical therapy and the adjustment to a wheelchair. 
 "I never want to let work go," said Ms. Pearce, who climbed her way up from researcher to senior producer. "I was always very focused on work, very driven. I loved it since the day I started." 
The American workplace has had to adapt to the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, which was signed into law in 1990. Offices and factories now contain accomodations like large-letter computer screens, elevators, wider doorways for wheelchairs, accessible work stations and special parking spaces. But these improvements and modifications are useless if a disabled employee cannot get to work.
Telecommuting, either full time, part time, or over short periods when the need arises, is an important aid to disabled workers who struggle with a commute, and labor experts say the practice is on the rise among the disabled.
Douglas Kruse, a professor of human resource management at Rutgers University, estimates that 7 percent of employed people with disabilities currently work 20 hours or more a week from home, compared with 4.1 percent in 1997. He estimates that in 10 years, at least 10 percent of workers with disabilities will be telecommuting. The figure could rise as high as 20 percent, he said, "depending on technological developments and the success of efforts to increase the employment of people with disabilities, since many of those who are not currently employed will find this type of work attractive."
Many disabled workers say they consider telecommuting to be the single most important factor enabling them to work. Robert O'Byrne, a senior applications specialist for New York Life and a quadriplegic, said he would be on public assistance if his employer had not allowed him to work from home. Mr. O'Byrne was injured at 19 when he slipped on a swimming pool deck and hit his head. He was unable to hold any jobs because of his disability until New York Life gave him the telecommuting option.
Mr. O'Byrne, 41, who taught himself programming, goes to the office for occasional meetings, driven there by his father in a specially equipped van. But, he said, the hour-and-a-half commute from his home in Wyckoff, N.J., to the company's offices in Manhattan, would be too exhausting.
The job at New York Life "gave me a sense of purpose," he said. "Instead of being a ward of the state, I now pay taxes."
Many employers who have been offered telecommuting are happy with the arrangement. Bill Wheatley, a vice president for NBC News, said Ms. Pearce's telecommuting schedule, which was unusual for the network when it was put in place, is working out well for all concerned.
Mr. O'Byrne's employer, New York Life, offers telecommuting to all employees. Fe Azores, New York Life's director of recruiting, said she thought that telecommuting had contributed to the productivity of the company's disabled workers.
Christine McMahon, chief operating officer of Easter Seals in New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, said: "We haven't even begun to see the bubble on telecommuting among the disabled. It's going to be more and more available."
Earlier this year, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission published a fact sheet (available online at www.eeoc.gov/facts/telework.html) describing situations where allowing disabled workers to work from home could be considered a reasonable accommodation under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
Sharon Rennert, senior attorney adviser of the A.D.A. division at the commission, said her office was getting a lot of questions from employers and from people with disabilities about when it was appropriate or necessary for companies to offer telecommuting options.
The key for each company, Ms. Rennert said, is whether the employee would clearly be unable to handle the job without telecommuting and whether the job was conducive to a work-at-home environment. Ms. Rennert stressed that decisions should be made on an individual basis between employer and employee.
Assuming the work can be done from home, the commission recommended that the companies allow disabled individuals to work at home, whether there is a formal program or not.
While Ms. Rennert said telecommuting was not a clear-cut requiremen under the disabilities act, she said the fact sheet "puts it on the radar screen for employers."
Mark Cheskin, an employment lawyer in Miami with the firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said that in many employment cases, courts have been wary of the idea that telecommuting might be required under the disabilities act. But, he added, with the commission's recently published fact sheet and improvements in technology, "I believe we're going to see more courts go in favor of employees."
Advocates for disabled people say that telecommuting could help lower the jobless rate among this population. Only 3 out of 10 disabled people aged 18 to 64 are employed either full time or part time, compared with 8 out of 10 people without a disability, according to a 2000 survey by the National Organization on Disability and Harris Interactive. 
"Telecommuting is a promising trend for the disabled and one way to get the unemployment rate down," said Professor Kruse of Rutgers. But he warned that it may not be appropriate for every disabled worker.
Many have no problem getting to the office, he said. Another concern is "that the disabled won't be in the mainstream of office life," he said. Telecommuters sometimes feel they are passed over for promotions or special projects because they lack face-to-face time with supervisors.
Still, for some disabled workers, telecommuting is the only option, said Donna Walters Kozberg, president of Lift, a job placement and training group for the disabled that helped Mr. O'Byrne find his job at New York Life.
She says she is happy to see employers becoming more accepting of the practice even in a tough economy. "This is a way firms can cut down on their overhead by reducing office space," she said. In addition, she said, high-speed Internet connections and improved computer security are making employers feel more comfortable with workers tapping into company networks from home.

When Women Lose Health Care Options

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE ANDREWS; Michelle Andrews is a freelance writer in Manhattan specializing in health care. Her column on its economics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: moneymeds @nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IN the rolling hills of eastern Missouri, family planning services can be hard to come by, especially if you're poor. For the last five years, Tina Dean, 39, and her daughter, Melissa, 20, have received annual gynecological exams and breast and cervical cancer screening through a state program for uninsured low-income women.
 Fees are based on their ability to pay: when they visited the Family Planning Clinic of Franklin County in St. Clair, near their hometown of Catawissa, this month, the women paid $12 each for their annual exams and an additional $60 for a six-month supply of birth control pills for Melissa. 
 For the elder Ms. Dean, who is unemployed, the Missouri program is a godsend. She estimates that without it, her daughter's birth control pills, alone, would have cost $500 last year -- more than they could afford.
Unfortunately, the State of Missouri has decided that it cannot afford it, either. To help close a $700 million budget gap, the Legislature eliminated the entire $5 million in state funding for the program this fiscal year. All that remains is $4.9 million in federal family planning funds.
"We're trying to control the damage," said Susan Hilton, executive director of the Missouri Family Health Council, which administers federal family planning funds for the state. "Clinics are talking about sharing staff, anything they can do to keep the doors open longer."
Ms. Hilton, who estimated that 33,000 women could be affected by the budget cuts, said that at least three clinics had already been shut down.
A study published this month by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the National Women's Law Center noted that women's access to health care has expanded in recent years -- an exception being abortion services, for which restrictions have increased. But it also suggests that women are at greater risk of losing services when economic times are tough. For one thing, the authors of the study said, women tend to be poorer than men and more likely to have jobs that provide no health insurance. They also tend to use health care services more often than men, and they live longer. Three-quarters of nursing home residents are elderly women, many of them on Medicaid, the government program that provides health insurance for low-income people, according to the study. 
When the safety net starts sprouting holes, "across the board, changes are going to disproportionately affect women," said Alina Salganicoff, vice president and director of women's health policy for the Kaiser Family Foundation and one of the study's authors.
Seventy percent of adults receiving health coverage under Medicaid are women, many of them pregnant or single mothers, according to the study. In recent years, many states expanded eligibility for Medicaid to allow more pregnant women and parents to qualify for coverage and to receive extra services. But that is changing: last year, Missouri's Medicaid program reduced from two years to one year the time that 160,000 new mothers could receive family planning services. In addition, an estimated 32,000 parents lost their Medicaid eligibility when the state lowered the income ceiling to qualify for the program.
"The state just doesn't have the money to spend" this year, said State Representative Carl Bearden, a Republican from St. Charles and chairman of the Missouri House Budget Committee. "We had to make tough decisions on what the state was going to fund, and that was an optional program."
Missouri isn't the only state enacting changes that affect low-income women. Texas is reducing Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women to 158 percent of federal poverty level from 185 percent. That means the income ceiling will be $24,000 for a family of three, down from $28,000. The move will affect about 8,300 women.
"I was shocked," said Leighton Ku, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, who has tracked the eligibility changes. "People hardly ever reduce eligibility for pregnant women because they want to encourage prenatal care," he said. 
ARIZONA has also reduced eligibility for pregnant women, and Minnesota plans to do so in 2004. California, New Jersey, Tennessee and Nebraska have lowered Medicaid eligibility for low-income parents, and Oklahoma has eliminated a program that helped many poor, elderly and disabled people deal with high medical costs.
Private insurance is no panacea for women, either. Because they often work part time at lower-wage jobs, women are less likely than men to have private health insurance coverage. Fifty-three percent of men were covered by their employers, compared with just 33 percent of women, according to another recent Kaiser Family Foundation study. Women who are covered under their husbands' policies can face problems, too: they sometimes lose their coverage when their husbands retire and sign up for Medicare.
Lorenza Abrams, 64, has been uninsured for three years, since her husband retired as a shipping clerk for an electronics manufacturer. She works three days a week at the Queens Community Civic Corporation near the couple's home in Flushing, Queens, but her job there doesn't offer health coverage. Mrs. Abrams has high cholesterol and high blood pressure, but because she doesn't have insurance she tries to stretch out her doctor visits and laboratory work to every six months instead of every three months. She has decided to put off surgery she needs on her shoulder until she turns 65 next month and qualifies for Medicare.
Mrs. Abrams is fortunate. At least she can look forward to having health insurance very soon. But others are not so lucky. If women don't get the care they need now, everyone may pay a price, in higher costs for insurance and public health programs down the road. 
Ms. Hilton, of the Missouri Family Health Council, cautioned that the cutbacks in family planning services had yet to have their full impact.
"The real fallout," she said, "will happen a few years from now, when birth rates and infant mortality rates start to rise."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Producing Abroad Is Harming Recovery

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
FOR nearly 29 months, the nation has struggled through a recession and a weak recovery. That is a long struggle, a new form of hardship for many Americans, who are tantalized with incessant forecasts that a decisive upturn is about to happen. But as the months wear on, the dogged optimism detaches from reality.
 For starters, the forecasters seem not to grasp how much the American economy has deviated from the standard business cycle and the standard cures. A major reason for the deviation is the mobility of American companies, particularly the ease with which they now shift operations to China and India. "The wholesale movement of jobs and production overseas is handcuffing the recovery," said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com. 
 In other downturns since World War II, the economy moved from healthy growth to contraction and back to healthy growth, all in less than two years. The downward swings were relatively easy to fix. The swings began when companies found themselves producing more goods and services than people bought. Inventories built up, particularly in manufacturing, and companies responded by cutting output until it was below demand. Rather than produce more, companies filled orders from stockpiles. As output declined, unemployment rose and wages stopped increasing. Capital spending also suffered. After all, why expand when the capacity to produce already exceeds demand?
But the damage did not last long. The Federal Reserve stepped in, cutting interest rates to encourage spending. Unemployment insurance, public spending, and sometimes tax cuts, helped resurrect demand. As spending picked up and inventories disappeared, prices began to rise, which encouraged more production. Hiring resumed, as did capital spending.
These various remedies are being used now, and there is some strength in spending. Yet inventories have failed to diminish, so prices, production, hiring and capital spending do not rise. 
The difficulty is that companies have a choice that was not as available in the last downturn 12 years ago. Rather than halt production at home, they shift it abroad to cut costs, particularly labor costs. They feel compelled to do this. If they did not, their competitors would upstage them with their own lower-cost, overseas production that takes away sales back home.
In the process, the mechanism for restoring our economy to healthy growth -- by reducing inventories and excess capacity -- fails to function properly. Inventories may seem to diminish when only "Made in America" is counted. But in the new global economy, what's made in America and what's made abroad both contribute to inventories and capacity. The total does not shrink, and the economy flounders month after month. 
Still, there is some relief. Super-low interest rates, mortgage refinancing, stepped-up military spending and some of the Bush tax cuts augur a temporary pop in economic growth. But temporary is the operative word. The more enduring pressure on the economy is downward, not upward. 
THE biggest beneficiary appears to be China. Abundant transportation has made China an ever-easier place for American companies to shift production of goods and services for sale in the market back home.
The nation's trade deficit, the excess of our imports over exports, has risen by 31 percent since the recession began in March 2001. The increase, totaling $114 billion, would add one percentage point to American economic growth -- enough to turn a weak recovery into a strong one -- if the rise in output were at home, not abroad. One-third of the total increase represents imports from China, Mr. Zandi says. Honing the figures, Steven S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, finds that China's total exports have tripled since 1994, and that 65 percent of the $244 billion increase comes from foreign companies in China.
"We are criticizing the Chinese as if they were cleaning our clock and the only part of China that is cleaning our clock is the part that we put there," Mr. Roach said.
What is to be done? If we do anything, we are likely to pressure the Chinese to float their currency. A floating yuan would rise against the dollar, making Chinese exports more costly in the United States. Pressure is already coming from Congress for the Bush administration to negotiate the float.
We could also force American companies, through regulations, to stay out of countries that fail to observe minimal labor and environmental standards. Regulation is not popular in America. But it could regain its popularity, if the alternative is a continual loss of jobs in every state.

Dealing With Addiction, and What Comes After

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS

 BODY:
ADDICTION costs corporate America billions of dollars a year in lost productivity, absenteeism and higher health care expenses. It also derails many once-promising careers.
 More companies are willing to offer assistance these days, especially as they deal with higher levels of employee stress from heightened workloads and job cuts. Yet many workers are still reluctant to take advantage of this help, for fear of jeopardizing their positions. 
 "Telling something so personal would have lessened my authority as a leader," said a 65-year-old executive of a computer company in Philadelphia who recently returned from 28 days of treatment for alcoholism. "As a manager, you have to create some distance between you and your employees." The executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had arranged for the treatment himself at the Caron Foundation, a rehabilitation center in Wernersville, Pa. 
He says his job has been business as usual since his return last spring, but he acknowledged making up a story about his extended absence, which he even gave to his boss. "I told them I was overstressed and my doctor asked me to rest for a month," he said.
Professionals in similar situations have many delicate issues to navigate. How, forexample, can they avoid being stigmatized by colleagues? And how can they explain gaps on a resume after a long treatment period?
Many employees who receive treatment -- whether for alcoholism or for drug, gambling or food addictions -- will undoubtedly have some difficulties in the beginning, experts say, but as they recover, so too will their careers.
Abuse of some drugs has been climbing in the workplace. According to Quest Diagnostics, which provides workplace drug tests, the number of workers and job applicants who tested positive for amphetamine use rose 17 percent in 2002 from the previous year. At the Waismann Institute, in Beverly Hills, Calif., 60 percent of the patients, mostly high-powered business people, are addicted to painkillers like OxyContin and Vicodin, up from about 10 percent four years ago, according to Dr. Clifford A. Bernstein, the medical director there.
Given the weakness in the economy and the job market, none of this surprises Dr. Kenneth Siegel, a psychologist and president of the Impact Group, an executive leadership consulting firm in Beverly Hills. In the economic downturn of the late 1980's and early 1990's, he said, "Valium suddenly become the most prescribed drug in America." Similarly, today's workers are seeking ways to curb their anxieties and depression, he said.
"I don't think you're going to find a lot of C.E.O.'s smoking pot or snorting cocaine in the company restroom," Dr. Siegel said, "but we are seeing executives abusing alcohol and popping prescription drugs."
One of the biggest difficulties is seeking help in the first place. Managers may be surrounded by underlings who are more than willing to help cover up the problem. A recent survey by the Caron Foundation of its patients found that 75 percent of executives in recovery said they had secretaries or assistants who went to great lengths to cover for them. Ninety percent said their peers had to work extra hours to compensate for their addiction.
Bruce Cotter, a recovering alcoholic, said that when he was a sales executive for major television networks on the East Coast during the 1980's, his assistants would routinely reschedule his appointments and even compile his sales reports. "I had a whole army of people who would mop up my messes," he said. Mr. Cotter now runs Bruce W. Cotter & Associates in Butler, Md., which intervenes on behalf of companies to provide treatment for addicted executives.
Another issue is confidentiality. Many workers, particularly executives, hesitate to seek help through their company's employee assistance programs or human resources departments, out of fear of looking weak or even harming the company's reputation.
"They feel that their company doesn't need to have the burden of knowing their top V.P., or C.E.O., is having a problem," said Dr. Scott C. Stacy, clinical program director for the Professional Renewal Center in Lawrence, Kan., which treats executives for substance and behavioral problems, including gambling and sexual addiction.
To help make executives feel more comfortable about seeking help, some companies are offering programs that promise heightened confidentiality, according to Dr. Richard A. Chaifetz, chief executive of the ComPsych Corporation in Chicago. ComPsych provides employee assistance programs to companies like General Electric, American Express and Sprint. Meanwhile, Resources for Living in Austin, Tex., whose clients include Wal-Mart and Bridgestone, has a substance-abuse counseling program that can be completed entirely by phone.
William P. Schurgin, a partner at the Seyfarth Shaw law firm in Chicago, says employers are generally under no obligation to keep workers with untreated substance-abuse problems on the payroll. The Americans With Disabilities Act, he noted, does not protect these employees. But he added that employers were much more likely to support those who request help rather than those whose problems were discovered through drug testing or other means. "Most companies are going to give you a second chance," he said.
After seeking help, patients should avoid trying to keep up workloads during treatment.
"That's not the time to focus on work," said Dennis Henning, a consultant in Camarillo, Calif. who helps addicted lawyers and executives in the entertainment industry receive help through an intervention program. Mr. Henning, who is himself recovering from an eating disorder, said he recently worked with a lawyer who would have co-workers sneak in work for him to do.
MR. COTTER said that he, too, had confiscated executives' cellphones and laptops after they entered a treatment center. "These people want to keep their careers on track, and so they don't feel like they can take a moment out for themselves," he said. "But I have to convince them that if they don't get help, their career -- not to mention their lives -- might end up in the toilet."
Career experts also warn against trying to do too much soon after returning to work.
"A lot of executives who return to work are so fearful of losing their jobs, especially in this economy, that they step up the pace of their work and don't take vacations, or even lunch breaks," said Ruth Luban, a psychotherapist based in Santa Monica, Calif. She suggests easing back into the workload, perhaps even working part time for a few weeks if possible. Once the person is back to a full-time schedule, he should set boundaries on the job, by taking time out for lunch each day, for example, she said. 
Reduced work schedules -- or even lunch breaks -- are not always possible for those who are feeling the pressure of work. Ms. Luban said she was working with a lawyer who recently was treated for a drug addiction and was about to return to work at a company that was merging with another concern. "There's only so much slack they can give him," she said.
She advised him to carve out tiny, regular portions in each day, so that he could "at least take a few deep breaths" without his bosses noticing.
IT'S up to the employee to decide whether to explain an absence for treatment to curious colleagues, said Liz Ryan, a human resources consultant in Boulder, Colo. Like the computer company executive from Pennsylvania who was treated for alcoholism, many of her clients chalk up the absence to an unspecified illness. But in some instances, she said, a recovering addict may need the support of a few trusted co-workers.
She said she recently worked with a salesman, a recovering alcoholic, whose boss had kept pressuring him to have a few beers with clients at late-night gatherings.
"He would really egg him on," she said. "Finally, the salesman had to clue in his boss, who was very understanding. If a boss or co-workers aren't supportive, by all means, look for a new opportunity." 
In some cases, of course, colleagues may know about a worker's problem before treatment is sought. Ms. Ryan once worked with a young woman who returned from a work outing so intoxicated that she passed out in the office in front of several employees. Shortly thereafter, she entered an alcohol recovery program. When she returned, Ms. Ryan recommended that she simply acknowledge to co-workers that she had dealt with the problem and was ready to move on.
"People have short attention spans," she said. "Once they see you're back and you're doing a good job, they'll lose interest."
Experts recommend that recovering addicts seek out support groups set up exclusively for executives or certain professionals. The groups can help deal with worries about attendance at cocktail parties, for example, or other networking events.
Other career concerns can be addressed in the groups. The Pennsylvania executive said he was involved in a therapy group made up of high-level executives. For three one-hour sessions a week, the members talked about how their careers had contributed to their addiction problems and gave one another tips on eliminating some of the biggest stresses from their jobs.
"All of a sudden, I felt like I wasn't alone anymore," he said.
Career experts recommend that job seekers not disclose past addiction problems to prospective employers in an interview. "Let's be realistic -- there's still somewhat of a stigma to saying that you're an addict," Ms. Ryan said.
She advises job seekers to carefully develop a speech that explains any resume gaps, and to practice it repeatedly. "Be prepared to say something like, 'I was resolving some health issues,' or 'I was doing some personal development work,' " she said. 
"Most hiring managers won't bat an eyelash at a three- or even six-month gap, especially in this economy."

HEADLINE: Smiling Through the 30th, A Birthday Once Apocalyptic 

BYLINE:  By VANESSA GRIGORIADIS

 BODY:
BY all accounts, Alison Zuker, an advertising creative director, is a very social person. This year, however, her calendar has been particularly cluttered -- not with weddings, baby showers or job promotion parties, but with celebrations of that once maligned milepost, the 30th birthday.
 Perched on a wooden bench at the Porch, a bar on a newly gentrified stretch of Avenue C, during a party for her friend Eli Wolf, an executive at Blue Note Records, Ms. Zuker estimated that she had been to two dozen such parties this year. "Easy," she said, crossing her legs. "In fact, some nights I'd hit three." 
 Once, turning 30 was slightly irritating, an embarrassing passage, and people were in no mood to broadcast the news. This was especially true for unmarried women and for men whose careers had not yet ignited. 
Today, when marriage is routinely delayed past 30 and the 20's are often an extended adolescence -- a time of romantic and professional hopscotch -- a 30th birthday feels to many the way 21 once did, as the gateway to the more serious adult world. It is no longer a day to count up regrets stoically, but to pop the Moet & Chandon. Increasingly, it is celebrated with all the pomp of a graduation blowout or a wedding reception, with formal invitations, speeches, rented halls or yachts, and guest lists drawn from every stage of the person's life.
"People have been treating 30's as bar mitzvahs, Sweet 16's or -- dare I say it? -- weddings," Ms. Zuker said.
With the years between college graduation and marriage stretching into the double digits, many yearn for a new rite of passage to fill the gap, and the Big Three-Oh has taken on this role. Ms. Zuker has recently attended a party lasting a weekend in Las Vegas, an "over the hill" gathering where the dress code was black but the atmosphere jovial, and celebrations with a "dirty 30" theme featuring visits tostrip clubs. Several friends included R.S.V.P. cards with their invitations or had memory books prominently placed for guests to record their thoughts.
Greg Clayman, a founder of Upoc, a mobile technology company in New York, sent out invitations (the cover showed one of his baby pictures ) to 600 people for his 30th. "It was an amazing retrospective, shall we say, of everyone I've known," Mr. Clayman said. "Even my doctor came."
Ms. Zuker, whose own birthday party was at the mod Lower East Side bar 17 Home in late June, said she had invited "equal amounts of people from ages 0 to 5, 6 to 18, college, after college and work."
"It wasn't, like, let's just send out an e-vite," said Ms. Zuker, who wore a red halter top and dashed around the room as if it were a networking event. "It was very, very strategic."
As Dan McAdams, a professor of psychology and human development at Northwestern University, sees it, "Thirty may signal more than it used to -- that you're really a full-fledged adult -- because people in contemporary modern life live differently in their 20's than they used to."
"The 20's are now a time of continued exploration and experimentation," Professor McAdams said. "People hedge their bets the way one used to in adolescence."
Turning 30 may have lost its stigma because expectations of one's 20's are so different from what they were a generation ago, experts say. In her best-selling 1976 book, "Passages: Predictable Crises of Adult Life," Gail Sheehy defined 30 as the beginning of midlife.
"During the 20's," she wrote, "when a man gains confidence by leaps and bounds, a married woman is usually losing the superior assurances she once had as an adolescent."
Betsy Carter, once the editor of My Generation, a former baby-boomer magazine that was published by AARP, recalled that when she turned 30 in 1975 she did not go to a single 30th-birthday party, "including my own."
"At that age" she said, "a lot of things were just beginning. You were married or pregnant, and you didn't need another reason to throw a party."
In an interview, Ms. Sheehy recalled: "When I was 29, I told people I was 30 just so I had a year to deal with it. People used to suffer in silence." Now, Ms. Sheehy added, a 30th-birthday party is a "showcase" of sorts "for those women making no bones about being single."
"Thirty," she said, "is the new 22."
Party planners and suppliers report a rising demand for 30th-birthday celebrations with all the trimmings.
"I get more requests for 30th-birthday cakes than 40ths at this point," said Edie Connolly, an owner of Cakes n' Shapes on West 39th Street.
Francesa Abbracciamento, an event planner in Manhattan, said: "With the economy the way it is, there's been a departure from corporate events, and the replacement is more private parties. And 30's a big one."
And while fewer people are turning 30 now than in the generation before them, Hallmark's sales of 30th-birthday cards have remained steady in recent years.
Mori Ninomiya, a founder of Take Out Marketing in New York, invited hundreds to his 30th birthday on July 10 at Double Happiness, a bar on Mott Street.
For her 30th in June, Selma Nasser, a publicist, celebrated both her birthday and her Middle Eastern heritage with a theme party for 90 at Soho House, the private club in the meatpacking district. She hired a belly dancer, screened "Lawrence of Arabia" and offered around a drink named "the Sheik Selma," made with freshly squeezed guava juice and vodka.
"It was really fun," Ms. Nasser said, "although apparently the Sheik Selma hurt a lot of people the next day."
In the last quarter-century, nearly everything about one's 20's has changed. Young people are living at home longer, experiencing a far longer period of job instability, marrying and having children later and staying in school longer.
Nationally, the average age of women at their first marriage was 25.3 last year, the highest ever, according to the Census Bureau; for men it was 26.9, the second-highest on record. In New York City, with its large numbers of well-educated professionals, the proportion of single people over 30 is especially high: 41.5 percent of those age 30 to 34 have never married, according to 2000 census data analyzed by the sociology department at Queens College.
"Thirty is where 25 was 40 or 50 years ago," said Frank Furstenberg, chairman of the MacArthur Network on Adult Transitions in Chicago.
"The main reason," he said, "is the growing demands of a skill-based economy," which prompts young people to live longer with their parents while they earn advanced degrees or save for a home. 
According to census data analyzed by American Demographics magazine, 15 percent of unmarried men and 8 percent of unmarried women 25 to 34 lived at home in 1998, compared with 9 percent of men and 7 percent of women in 1970.
A simple explanation for why the perception of the 30th birthday is changing, said Matti Gershenfeld, a psychologist in Jenkintown, Pa., is that people live longer. The life expectancy of a male born in 2000 was 74.1 at birth, and of a female, 79.5 -- compared with 46.3 for males and 48.3 for females born in 1900. "So 30 isn't the midpoint in your life, much less middle-aged," Ms. Gershenfeld said.
Jill Grigsby, a professor of sociology at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., said, "There are people now who think they're not middle-aged until they're 60."
Blake Bhatia would agree. "I always viewed life in three stages, or trimesters," said Mr. Bhatia, a technology entrepreneur in New York who celebrated his 30th birthday last month by chartering a yacht for 130 guests. "The first 30 years of your life is your childhood, the next 30 years your adulthood, and from 60 and hopefully till 90, your golden years."
Mr. Bhatia, who received a Rolex watch from his mother and cash from other family members, followed his yacht dinner with a party at a Chelsea restaurant and a weekend gathering at his house in the Hamptons. (Total cost of the celebration: $25,000 to $30,000.) He addressed the gathering with a 45-minute speech reflecting on the good times he had had with friends, many of them present, from his toddler years to now.
As with Mr. Bhatia, Ms. Zuker's priority on her birthday was celebrating herself. Although she had made it clear to her boyfriend that she was in no hurry to have a ring, she received a Tiffany box from him on her 30th. "I was opening the package -- like, 'What is this now?' " Ms. Zuker said. It turned out to be a large crystal paperweight. "He was, like, 'I got you the biggest diamond that Tiffany's had,' " she said. "Then he kept asking: 'Is it big enough? Is it big enough?' He thought that was really funny." 
Although women at this age generally express a desire to hold out for Mr. Right, not all the traditional anxiety at being 30 and single has dissipated.
"It's not all rah-rah," said Stephanie Deutsch, a New York Web producer who turned 30 on May 20. "There's certainly societal pressure to be with someone at this age. My grandparents are asking about children."
Ms. Deutsch chose to celebrate her birthday as an occasion for female bonding: she had dinner with 14 girlfriends and 6 women from her family, including her grandmother. Speeches were made, and each guest took home a vase filled with fresh roses.
"I was single for a really long time, and I felt that I wanted to be surrounded by all the women in my life," Ms. Deutsch said. "Thirty is a big deal, or at least it is to me, and I wanted to be with the people who've supported me on my journey getting older." Ms. Deutsch's boyfriend, brother and father were allowed in only during the dessert course.
Turning 30 has become the new "threshold age of adulthood," said Jeffrey Arnett, a professor at the University of Maryland and the author of "Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road From the Late Teens Through the Twenties," to be published next year by Oxford University Press. "Instead of social transitions like marriage and parenthood," he said, "people now define themselves as adults by individual markers. Adulthood is about accepting responsibility, making individual decisions and becoming financially independent."
"By age 30," he added, "the majority of people think they've reached adulthood, whereas before then people think of themselves as not quite there."
Last Sunday night, about 50 friends gathered to celebrate with Ahna Tessler, a comedian, at a humid apartment hung with white streamers in Chinatown. Kazoos were stacked on end tables. Before Ms. Tessler blew out the 30 candles on her chocolate cake, Frank Sinatra sang "I Did It My Way" from the stereo.
Ms. Tessler had required her guests, a group of actors, writers and comedians rarely seen out of jeans, to dress up -- cocktail dresses for the women and suits, or at least ties, for the men.
"I just bought this off the street for $4," said Matt Hyams, gesturing to his striped tie.
He stood with Mark Alhadeff, an actor, who was wearing a heavy blue suit.
"A girl has a 30th birthday, and you date her best friend, and so you end up in a suit," said Mr. Alhadeff, dabbing sweat from his forehead.

Want to Stop the Conversation? Just Mention Your Finances

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THIS summer, I rented a beach house with four friends in Sag Harbor on Long Island. It's a great old place with hardwood floors, window seats and a patio overlooking the water. We all work in the publishing industry and spendmany hours discussing our jobs, love lives, plastic surgery and politics -- everything except, strangely, money.
 Sure, we talk about dividing our purchases evenly and reimbursing one another, but no one discusses salary, savings or how much is owed on the Visa card. 
 "Talking about your love life is light and entertaining, but it's rude to ask how much someone makes," said Leigh Gallagher, 30, one of my housemates and a reporter at Forbes magazine.
Financial etiquette seems to vary by geography and, to some extent, the condition of the economy. I have found that in New York, it may be unacceptable to talk about income, but that it is often O.K. to ask someone how much they pay in rent or maintenance. Such questions may be considered crass elsewhere. People I know in parts of Europe and Latin America say it is common for friends to ask one another about their economic status. And during the dot-com heyday, many people traded stock option information like baseball cards; talking about money was part of the culture. 
"I think it goes back to my parents who were raised in the Depression, and for them money is an off-limits subject," said Lowell Jaffe, 38, the chief executive of New World Traders, a fashion accessories manufacturer based in Chicago, of his reluctance to discuss financial matters. "I have a much easier time talking about anything -- you name it -- than money." 
From my own childhood, I recall my mother taking me to see a rather racy film, "Animal House," but refusing to talk about our household income.
"It wasn't your concern," she told me recently. "As long as the child's needs are met emotionally and financially, there's no reason to discuss family finances. I never thought of asking my own father what he made."
Point taken. But I always wanted to know if we were rich. (I was told that we were "comfortable.")
Some celebrities and political figures who come from modest means are happy to share their struggles; it makes their triumphs that much more pronounced. But if you come from a well-to-do family, lips are usually firmly sealed. 
"Talking about your experience with money is, at a very deep level, talking about where you came from, who you are now, what kind of person you ultimately want to be, what kind of relationships you value and where you find meaning in life," said Pamela York Klainer, a workplace consultant and the author of "How Much is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story -- and Change Your Life" (Basic Books).
"Money is a very tangible expression of what you do and what you really care about," she said. "Talking about your experience of money has everything to do with how you understand professional success, and with whether you can allow yourself to be happy."
Frankly, I'd be in big trouble if my self-worth were wrapped up in my net worth. That could explain why I've never really minded talking about my financial situation: my salary isn't significant enough to be newsworthy, although I do feel a sense of pride for having been able to survive for several years in New York as a freelance writer.
My brother, Ray, a comedian, is equally candid about his income. But our sister, Hillary, who works in Silicon Valley, says, "Showing off one's fancy car, P.D.A. with integrated MP3 player, summer house, or throwing an elaborate party, is a classier way of communicating monetary status."
Dr. York Klainer says Americans, over all, are far too secretive about money topics.
"Money is an ordinary part of life; we use it more than we eat, pray or have sex," she said. "The way we learn anything and become sophisticated is by talking about it."
CANDACE BAHR, a co-founder of the Women's Institute for Financial Education (www.wife.org) a nonprofit organization, agreed. Ms. Bahr is also a co-founder of the Money Club (www.moneyclubs.com), which helps establish support groups for women who want to take control of their financial lives. Members discuss their financial aspirations and pitfalls and help one another plan for the future. There are 43 clubs around the country.
"I had just gotten myself out of $17,000 in debt and wanted to not end up there again when I found out about the Money Club," said Maru Corrada, an interior redesigner in her mid-30's who started a Money Club in her neighborhood of San Diego. "It's helped me a lot to talk to other people who are struggling with the same issues. It makes you feel less alone."
Here's what I say: From now on, when the subject of money comes up, embrace it. Discuss your debt. Acknowledge that your boss gave you only a small fraction of the raise you deserve, and that you are struggling to pay your rent. 
But if someone asks how much you weigh, run for the hills.

HEADLINE: Investing; 
An Assortment of Advice, but at What Price?

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH REED SMITH

 BODY:
ALAN M. JACOBSEN says he became concerned that his financial adviser was more interested in earning high commissions than in protecting his investments.
 On top of annual account maintenance fees averaging 1.3 percent of the $350,000 in his portfolio, Mr. Jacobsen said that over the five years of his investment he paid an additional $12,000, including sales charges on mutual funds and fees associated with a high-cost variable annuity. 
 "The costs were really driving us nuts," said Mr. Jacobsen, 64, who lives in Waterloo, Iowa, with his wife, Judith. So, in the summer of 2000, he severed ties with American Express Financial Advisors and with Terry Kuntz, his adviser there. He switched to Jon A. Ford, an independent financial adviser in Cedar Falls, Iowa, who charges an annual fee of 1 percent of the value of his portfolio, with no additional costs. 
Mr. Kuntz and American Express declined to comment about Mr. Jacobsen's complaints, but David E. Kanihan, a spokesman for the company, said, "We have never been about trying to make money off clients in the short term." 
In recent years, many people have become angry about the cost of investing through stockbrokers, who often bear the titles of financial advisers or financial consultants. The widespread adoption of these titles confuses some consumers, who are unable to "differentiate among the blurring traditional channel segments of the advice market," according to a recent study by Cerulli Associates, a Boston consulting firm.
Investors should understand that their interests aren't always aligned with those of financial advisers, particularly those employed by big brokerage firms, said Barbara L. Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America. 
"While I do think the big houses have changed somewhat in the way they do business, in the end these are still primarily salespeople who are marketing themselves as advisers," she said. It's important, she added, to remember that advisers at large firms "are ultimately beholden to their employers."
Most small investors can manage quite well on their own with no-load mutual funds, Ms. Roper said. Those who feel they need help, she added, would be better off using independent financial advisers whose income comes solely from fees -- not commissions.
Large Wall Street brokerage firms say their fees are fair and straightforward, and that their analytical resources far outstrip the capabilities of any independent financial planner. In the last five years, the brokerage firms have generally moved away from relying primarily on commissions and now charge most customers annual fees based on assets under management. These fees generally range from 1 to 3 percent of assets.
Brokerage firms typically charge lower percentages for larger portfolios and are often willing to negotiate terms with wealthier clients. The smaller an investor's portfolio, however, the less flexibility he is likely to have in negotiating compensation with a broker.
In return, the brokers set up investment strategies and often offer tax management, estate and retirement planning and advice on college savings plans. While asset-based fees generally cover most direct costs borne directly by the investor, additional commissions are sometimes charged. And many advisers collect additional sales commissions from insurance firms, banks and mutual fund companies.
Brokerage firms say they train their advisers to focus on a client's long-term interests. Mr. Kanihan, the spokesman for American Express Financial Advisors, who said he could not comment about Mr. Jacobsen's situation, said that the company wanted to "build long-term relationships with clients." 
At Merrill Lynch, the biggest brokerage firm, roughly 14,000 financial advisers rely mainly on asset-based fees, but they can earn commissions, depending on the arrangement with their clients, according to Erik Hendrickson, spokesman for Merrill. 
"What we say is there is no one right way in terms of the compensation structure," Mr. Hendrickson said. "It's up to the client and to the adviser to decide." Mr. Hendrickson added that Merrill takes measures to ensure that advisers are fair to clients. Fundamentally, he said, "financial advisers prosper as his or her clients prosper and as the number of prospering clients grows."
DENNY CUMMINGS, a Merrill financial adviser in Chicago, said that his clients' portfolios generally ranged from $5 million to $25 million each and that his annual fees averaged 1.1 percent of a portfolio's value. He said he preferred annual fees to commissions. "Commissions bring too much potential conflict, and even if there is no conflict, there is the perceived issue of conflict," he said.
Federal and state laws require that financial advisers try to avoid conflicts of interest and to disclose potential problems, said Robert E. Plaze, associate director of investment management at the Securities and Exchange Commission. But he said investors should understand that one way or another, they will have to pay for financial advice.
Fees can diminish long-term returns. Consider what happens to $100,000 invested in stock and bond funds yielding 8 percent over 20 years. Assuming that dividends are reinvested, the value compounds to $466,000 minus costs. When an investor pays an annual fee of 1 percent of the value of his portfolio, the investment loses $79,000, to $387,000. It plunges to $265,000 if annual expenses hit 3 percent. And that is before taxes and inflation are considered. 
"The single most important factor you can control, and the one that will have the greatest effect on your long-term success, is cost," Ms. Roper said. 
Excessive costs are one reason the S.E.C. began an investigation recently into the way brokerage firms sell mutual funds. In May, the S.E.C. chairman, William H. Donaldson, told a House Financial Services subcommittee that the agency would examine whether incentives at large firms push brokers to sell mutual funds that generate high commissions to customers, even though such investments may be unsuitable for them.
On July 10, the S.E.C. fined Prudential Securities $382,000 for failing to adequately supervise a broker who sold mutual fund shares that generated inappropriately high commissions. The S.E.C. and state regulators in New York and Massachusetts are investigating whether Morgan Stanley misled investors who bought its mutual funds. In a statement last week, Morgan Stanley acknowledged that it had paid its brokers higher commissions for selling its own funds. "Morgan Stanley supports enhanced disclosure in the fund industry and will continue to cooperate fully with various regulators," the firm said.
Charles Schwab, the big discount brokerage firm, says it keeps investors' costs low by charging fees for specific services, instead of imposing continuing annual fees for retaining an adviser, said Morrison Shafroth, a spokesman. For example, Schwab will balance an investor's portfolio once for $250. Schwab also refers investors with at least $250,000 in assets to affiliated independent advisory firms, which typically charge a fee of about 1 percent of assets. Not included in that fee are the costs of transactions through Schwab.
Investors can get information from the S.E.C. about financial advisers who manage more than $25 million in client assets. Those records are online at http://www.sec.gov/investor/brokers.htm.
Other advisers must register with state securities regulators. The North American Securities Administrators Association (http://www.nasaa.org/nasaa/abtnasaa/find_regulator.asp) provides investors with an online link to those state filings.
Ms. Roper suggested that consumers choose independent advisers through the National Association of Professional Financial Advisors (www.napfa.org), whose members earn their income solely from fees based on a percentage of managed assets.
Another group, the Financial Planning Association -- www.fpanet.org -- does not insist that its members adhere to this compensation structure. The Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, which accredits financial planners, is another good source (www.cfp.net). It does not require its members to adhere to a specific compensation structure but monitors those who claim to limit themselves to fees from clients.
Sheryl D. Garrett, an independent financial adviser in Shawnee, Kan., said she charges clients $180 an hour, with no commissions, for a broad range of advice; clients then put her strategy into effect by themselves. 
Ms. Garrett said she began her career 16 years ago at a large firm. "I was miserable there because I couldn't just advise people on their investments," she said. "I was always under pressure to sell products."
John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group and a longtime critic of the financial services industry, says it is crucial to understand that the financial services sector is essentially sales driven. "Given their temperament and the nature of the profession, brokers and advisers are usually bullish," Mr. Bogle said. "The whole system depends on their ability to sell you things. So their integrity is tough to measure."

HEADLINE: Leaning on Their Parents, Again 

BYLINE:  By JENNIE GREEN

 BODY:
IN November 1999, Josh Maeir moved from Chicago to Sharon, Mass., so that his wife and two young sons could be closer to his in-laws. An experienced software engineer, Mr. Maeir took an upper-level management position at a company that makes materials testing equipment. A year later, he accepted a more challenging and lucrative opportunity at a start-up that designs traffic monitoring systems. 
 But by July 2002, the start-up's investment capital had been reduced by half, and Mr. Maeir was out of a job. 
 "I wasn't too worried in the beginning," said Mr. Maeir, who is 39. "But after three or four months we had burned through our savings and still nothing was happening. My wife is a stay-at-home mom. A year later, with unemployment running out, I can see the need to get a couple of 'bridge' jobs." 
He is now working as a bank teller and has applied for part-time sales jobs at RadioShack and Home Depot. He estimates that if he has two jobs, he will earn about $25,000 a year, including benefits, about one-third of his former income. Despite his predicament, his two sons, aged 3 and 6, continue to attend an independent day school, his wife continues to care for them and the family continues to live in a comfortable home.
Moreover, he has preserved the debt-free state in which he entered unemployment. For him, the solution is straightforward but not simple: he is among a growing number of mature professionals who receive financial assistance from parents, in-laws or both.
Figures are unavailable on the flow of dollars from 60-, 70- and 80-year-old Americans to their adult children who are unemployed or underemployed. But there appears to be an increase in the number of adults who depend on parents because of prolonged employment problems.
"I hear about it all the time," said Lisa Miller, executive director of Clear Connections, a networking and support center based in Dallas for displaced professionals. "Nowadays, our members are getting help not only from their parents, but also from their in-laws, brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles and cousins."
Niels H. Nielsen, author of "Princeton Management Consultants Guide to Your New Job" (John Wiley & Sons), agreed. He said that while many displaced workers received help from their parents, few would be willing to acknowledge it. 
"The underlying reality is that a lot of people are getting pretty desperate now," Mr. Nielsen said. "It also doesn't help that there's tremendous denial among information technology professionals about getting back to work in their field."
As of June, about nine million Americans were unemployed, or 6.4 percent of the work force, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That compares with a rate of just 3.9 percent in October 2000.
For many white-collar workers, the periods of unemployment can be long. Last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, these workers accounted for 46.3 percent of all people who were unemployed for at least 27 weeks. Thatis up from 35.1 percent in 1997. 
If family dynamics can be complicated and bewildering when resources are plentiful, imagine how tension can escalate when finances dry up.
"It feels strange to become dependent after all these years," Mr. Maeir said. "It's not a situation that I ever would have imagined I'd be in -- especially not for so long. My mother and my in-laws help out because they can, because they're generous, and because they really care about us. But there are some strings. We were always careful about how we spent money. But now we feel self-conscious. Once, when we hired an electrician to fix a ceiling fan, it turned into this big deal because my in-laws considered it to be an extravagance." 
In more than a dozen interviews with people in their 30's, 40's and 50's who have accepted cash loans or gifts from their parents in the last few years, some patterns emerged. Unemployed adults who had functioned successfully in the workplace for many years all felt considerable shame about their new situations.
They know that they were laid off, not fired, but that didn't stop them from blaming themselves. "I am a 45-year-old man," said Steven Fields, a former systems administrator at Electronic Data Systems in Dallas. "I should be independent enough to pay my own rent. I feel so grateful to my dad for literally saving me from becoming homeless, but it's extremely hard on the self-esteem."
THE newly unemployed may rarely ask for help, even when bank balances dip into the single digits. When they do accept assistance, it tends to be with a combination of gratitude and hesitation. And they often fret over disappointing their parents, whom they imagine will encounter future hardship as a result of the generosity.
Unemployed professionals can have a hard time communicating with parents who have little or no firsthand experience with professional insecurity. Gordon Hatcher is a husband, father, and designer of custom telecommunications systems who says he was laid off from "the best job I ever had" -- at Sun Microsystems in Boston, in November 2002.
Just after he became unemployed, Mr. Hatcher's mother, a long-divorced college professor, started to send money, unsolicited, in what Mr. Hatcher described as a "pure and generous way." Mr. Hatcher said his father, who built missiles for the federal government at companies like Raytheon for 30 years, had a more negative perspective about the situation. "He couldn't understand why I didn't run out the day I became unemployed to find a job as an airport baggage checker or with the federal government," Mr. Hatcher said.
Richard Harris of Westborough, Mass., was happy to support his son, daughter-in-law and grandson, who live in San Francisco, for a year, but then he started to wonder if he was doing his son a disservice. "It's getting into quite a bit of money now," Mr. Harris said. "But I'm not worried about that. I worry now that my son is at risk of losing the confidence and independence that I enjoyed throughout my adult life." 
Mr. Harris said that when he told his son that he had decided to reduce his monthly allowance by 60 percent for six months, before he withdrew support altogether, his son understood. "I said to him, Andy, your life as you know it is over." Shortly thereafter, his son landed his first temporary job. 
For years, Karl Pillemer, a professor of human development at Cornell University, has studied relationships between aging parents and their adult offspring. When adult children have problems they seem to have brought on themselves, Professor Pillemer has found, their parents tend to become upset. When the adult children suffer from problems that don't seem to be of their own making -- like corporate layoffs -- the parents tend to feel more sympathy.
But only to a point. When unemployment continues for more than six months, the older generation starts to worry that something is wrong with the children. 
"Usually, unemployment isn't perceived as a problem until it goes on for a long time," Professor Pillemer said. "Only then do most parents worry that their children have stopped developing normally. The most important thing for any new parent to hear is that their baby is normal. This continues throughout the life cycle. At some point, most parents want to feel that their job is done -- that their children might even become a source of support for them in their old age."
OLDER people who decide to help their adult children often do so with ambivalence. Many professionals in their 60's and early 70's came of age in the post-Depression era, when working hard was insurance against unemployment. Some people from this generation may believe that an unemployed child who really wants a job can get one after a couple of weeks.
Others, like Joel Goldberg, who is Mr. Maeir's father-in-law and a certified public accountant with his own firm, are sorry that a high cost of living has coincided with the loss of a job. "I bought our home when the cost of a house was a couple of years' salary," Mr. Goldberg said. "It was easier to get set up back then. We raised our kids to be self-sufficient, so my daughter is quite unhappy now. Josh is also unhappy because he's an ambitious guy who wants to get out there and do something. It's a real boot in the tail to be unemployed, even if it's not your fault. So we try to be supportive; we try not to say anything that's going to make them feel worse. 
"On the other hand, it can get expensive. It's not a fortune, though. Heck, instead of buying a new car this year I can just fix the old one."
David Roane, physician in charge of geriatric psychiatry at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, says his patients have always talked about whether their adult children have achieved financial independence. "My sense is that it has less to do with resentment and more to do with them thinking about their own mortality, and how things are going to be when they approach the end of their lives," Dr. Roane said.
That leads to questions from parents about their adult children's choices in careers, spending and housing. When adult children become dependent after long periods of independence, many parents feel almost obligated to voice opinions they had previously kept to themselves. And that can lead to conflicts.
Aside from short-term unemployment benefits, few public resources are available to dislocated professionals who turn to family for support and struggle to redefine relationships and revise expectations. Economic independence is a condition that aging parents and their adult children are thought to aspire to naturally; it is also part of the collective American identity.
"Here in the United States," Professor Pillemer said, "intimacy at a distance is the ideal condition for relationships between parents and their adult offspring."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: William J. Nasgovitz And Eric J. Miller; 
Heartland Value Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
THE bull is out of the barn, say William J. Nasgovitz and Eric J. Miller, co-managers of the $1.02 billion Heartland Value fund, which specializes in small companies.
 The managers point to various signs that a bull market began in April: rising corporate profits in 2002, historically low interest rates and technical trading patterns that suggested that a market bottom had been reached and that stocks were on the way up. 
 The stocks of small companies are in their fourth year of outperforming bigger stocks. But small stocks "are coming off an incredibly depressed valuation base after the speculative excesses" of 1998 to 2000, Mr. Nasgovitz said from the managers' office in Milwaukee. 
Smaller companies are still much cheaper than big ones, Mr. Miller said. "We're finding scores of small-cap and microcap companies that are industry leaders but selling at half the market multiple or less," he added. 
The fund returned 17.3 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, placing in the top 6 percent of funds that buy small-cap value stocks. That category gained 10.6 percent, annualized, compared with a loss of 12.1 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc.
The fund returned 27.3 percent in the last 12 months, compared with a gain of 13.5 percent for its group and a 10.3 percent loss for the S.& P. 500.
Mr. Nasgovitz, 58, is the founder and president of Heartland Advisors, the fund's adviser. Mr. Miller, 49, is a senior vice president of the adviser. Heartland manages about $1.4 billion for institutions and individuals.
The managers buy stocks with market capitalizations of less than $1.5 billion. About two-thirds of the stocks in the portfolio are microcaps, defined as having market caps of less than $300 million. Over all, the portfolio companies' median market capitalization is $151 million.
Timing the purchase of a microcap stock is particularly tricky, Mr. Nasgovitz said. "Because the companies have little or no analyst coverage," he said, "they can be great stories but they may not get discovered until two years later."
To minimize these and other risks, the managers use traditional value measures, seeking companies with low ratios of price to earnings, price to book value and price to cash flow. 
They also want companies with relatively little debt, generally those with a ratio of debt to total capitalization of no more than 25 percent. That ratio now averages 20 percent for the portfolio, Mr. Miller said.
Mr. Nasgovitz says microcap stocks have also been performing well because they have received more attention from hedge funds, which he called a "growing and important side of the equity market."
The managers visit 500 to 1,000 companies a year, conducting what they call "on the ground" research.
"We like to get a feel for what's going on in the trenches from the people who are doing the production and making the sales," Mr. Miller said.
The managers start selling microcap stocks as they approach 85 to 90 percent of their price targets, and sell bigger companies as they reach their targets.
Among the fund's holdings are shares of the Regis Corporation, the hair salon company whose brands include Regis, MasterCuts and Trade Secret. The fund originally bought shares in January 2001 and has paid $14.90, on average, for the entire position. The shares now trade at $29.45; the managers say they believe shares will be worth $34 in the next 12 to 18 months.
Mr. Nasgovitz called Regis "a low-risk retail play" that has provided consistent and solid growth in same-store sales, those for salons open at least a year. 
Regis, which is based in Minneapolis, earned $1.59 a share in the 2002 fiscal year, compared with $1.26 a share the previous year.
The managers began buying shares of Ribapharm Inc., a biotechnology company in Costa Mesa, Calif., in April 2002 at $7.79, on average. The stock now trades at $5.58, compared with a target price of $10.
Ribapharm produces Ribaviran, which is used to treat hepatitis C. ICN Pharmaceuticals, which owns 80 percent of Ribapharm shares, spun off 20 percent of the company last year at $10 a share and is trying to repurchase those shares for $5.60. 
The fund, which has owned shares in ICN for years, acquired shares of Ribapharm in the spinoff..
Last week, a federal judge in California ruled that three generic versions of Ribavarin did not infringe on Ribapharm's patents. The company plans to appeal that ruling.
"Even if they lose that appeal, we believe Ribapharm should earn 40 cents a share next year, so it appears to us that the downside is already fully priced into the market," Mr. Nasgovitz said.
THE fund originally bought shares of the Presidential Life Corporation, an insurer based in Nyack, N.Y., in September 1994, paying $6.06, on average. The stock now trades at $15.59, compared with the managers' target price of $20.
The company recently wrote off some investments in high-yield telecommunications bonds, Mr. Nasgovitz said, but its tangible book value still exceeds $14 a share. He expects the company to earn $1.40 a share in 2004, up from the 90 cents a share projected for 2003. 
Company insiders have made more than 30 purchases so far this year, he added, and Herbert Kurz, the president and chairman, owns nearly 30 percent of the company.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES; 
Good for Your Conscience, if Not for Your Wallet

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of CBS MarketWatch. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MUTUAL funds that call themselves socially responsible have had striking growth in assets over the last decade, fueled in part by the perception that they can more than hold their own with the rest of the fund industry. A new study, however, calls that idea into doubt.
 Such funds screen potential investments according to many social or ethical criteria. Common screens aim to avoid companies involved in the alcohol, tobacco, gambling or military industries, or companies that pollute the environment or mistreat workers. 
 The new study conflicts with many previous ones, which found that socially responsible funds, on average, outperformed other stock mutual funds in the 1990's. But many of those studies were conducted before the technology bubble burst in early 2000. The typical socially responsible fund has an outsized allocation to tech stocks, so its strong performance in the 90's might have reflected no more than that sector's strength.
Unless you believe that technology stocks will always beat the market, you shouldn't make long-term bets that socially responsible funds will outperform other funds.
Many socially responsible funds are partial to the technology sector because tech companies often score well on the funds' screens. In the five years through May, according to Shannon Zimmerman, fund analyst at Morningstar Inc., the average socially responsible equity fund allocated 23 percent of its portfolio to the tech and telecommunications sectors, versus an average of 14.5 percent for all other equity funds.
The heavy allocation to technology may also help to explain the socially responsible stock funds' recent relative strength. According to Lipper Inc., such funds produced an average gain of 15.5 percent in the second quarter, slightly better than the 15.4 percent total return for the S.& P. 500-stock index.
Three researchers at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania have found a way to analyze socially responsible funds that is less influenced by the performance of the tech sector. The study, by Christopher C. Geczy and Robert F. Stambaugh, both finance professors, and David Levin, one of their graduate students, can be found at http://finance.wharton.upenn.edu/stambaug/sri.pdf. 
The researchers analyzed socially responsible funds in light of market factors that historically have been most correlated with fund performance, like the average market capitalization of a fund's stock holdings or where its stocks fall on the value-growth spectrum. Within the universe of socially responsible funds, they found that there is a smaller range of meaningful choices among these factors. Over time, they say, that reduces returns for investors who build a portfolio of such funds.
Because socially responsible funds are more oriented toward growth stocks than value stocks, for example, investors may find that their portfolios will suffer over time. According to separate research by Eugene F. Fama of the University of Chicago and Kenneth R. French of Dartmouth, the average value stock outperformed the average growth stock by 3.5 percentage points a year, annualized, over the last 77 years.
OF course, you may not believe that this pattern will continue, but the Wharton researchers also tested other assumptions about market performance. In each case, they found that the smaller range of meaningful choices among socially responsible funds reduced investors' likely returns, often by several points a year.
Recently, some advocates of socially responsible investing have suggested that companies be avoided if they severely restrict shareholder rights. Screening companies this way might well bolster expected returns, because one academic study has found that, during the 1990's, companies with the fewest such restrictions outperformed those with the most. But because few socially responsible funds have added corporate governance criteria to their social screens, the Wharton study sheds no light on this strategy's profitability.
Even if you accept the study's conclusion that your returns will suffer if you invest in socially responsible mutual funds, you should not automatically avoid them. But investors in these funds need to be willing to bear an additional cost.

HEADLINE: It's a Fat World, After All 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LANGLEY

 BODY:
THE world economy may be slumping, but there is conspicuous growth in at least one area: waistlines.
 Been to Germany lately? Every third child under age 12 and every fifth teenager there is overweight. How about Greece, land of the much-ballyhooed Mediterranean diet? More than 70 percent of adult men and women in that nation are above their ideal size. The Middle East? About 60 percent of the women in Egypt are overweight. 
 Indeed, the problem of excess consumption has spread to every corner of the globe, except for pockets of Africa. The United States, in other words, no longer enjoys a competitive advantage when it comes to corpulence. 
Americans -- 61 percent of whom are overweight -- may take comfort in the fact that they're not the only ones packing on the pounds. But multinational food companies could soon find themselves carrying the increasing weight of the world upon their corporate shoulders. That's because the War Against Fat has become a global conflict, and the rules of engagement appear to be changing. While lawsuits seem to be the American tool of choice, European officials are far less averse than their counterparts in the United States to deploy their most powerful weapon: regulations.
For food companies, the stakes could be large. Last year, American companies exported 11.8 billion euros ($13.22 billion at current exchange rates) of agricultural products to the European Union, everything from cranberries and candy bars to cereals and sodas. It's not at all certain that corporations can satisfy shareholder hunger for growth and still fulfill demands by regulators to sell smaller portions and healthier foods. 
The message to consume less is hardly a capitalist notion. Food companies grow by selling to more people, or convincing existing customers to eat more. "They don't have a lot of potential for expansion left in the United States," said Marion Nestle, chairwoman of the nutrition and food studies department at New York University and author of "Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health" (University of California Press, 2002). Because of that, she said, American companies have been exporting the salty, sugary foods they are known for and undermining the generally healthier eating habits of other countries. 
Unlike the United States, Europe has a tradition of regulating problems away. Chances are small that the Bush administration will threaten food companies with more regulations. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration recently made it easier for companies to make health and nutrition claims on food. The European Union, on the other hand, proposed a directive last week that would make it much tougher for companies to make such claims. 
DAVID BYRNE, the health commissioner for the European Union, seemed to catch the food industry by surprise on Wednesday when he proposed the regulations, which would prevent companies from marketing a food as having a health or nutrition benefit if it was also high in salt, sugar or fat. Mr. Byrne has not yet completed the profile of what foods would be affected, so executives say it is too early to panic. The rules, if passed by the European Parliament, would go into effect in 2005. 
Still, if Mr. Byrne has his way, the makers of most processed foods, from snacks to soups, may be barred from saying the products are nutritious.
Later this year, Mr. Byrne plans to propose changes in the way nutrition labels are written, to make them more comprehensible to consumers and to allow only products that are low in salt, sugar and fat to be fortified with vitamins and minerals. Food that did not meet certain criteria could not be marketed with claims that they are nutritious. 
In March, the World Health Organization issued a report that connected improper diet, along with a decline in physical activity, to a devastating rise in chronic diseases like heart conditions, diabetes, osteoporosis and cancer. By 2020, chronic diseases will account for nearly three-fourths of all deaths worldwide, the report said. This fall, the W.H.O. will release a draft of recommendations to its 191 member states on how to address the problem, and it is expected to consider important issues for business, like nutritional labeling and marketing to children. 
A result is that food companies, long believed to be recession-proof, are facing scrutiny by investors who are factoring in the risk of litigation and regulation in valuing them, according to a recent research report by the UBS Investment Bank. 
"There is a slow, but clear, evolution of how regulators are looking at these issues," said Arnaud Langlois, vice president for equity research at J. P. Morgan Chase in London. The impact on food companies, he said, is not all negative. 
"It doesn't change our view of the sector," Mr. Langlois said. "To meet consumer demand for healthier products, companies will have to reposition and upgrade their product portfolio. We believe that consumers are prepared to pay a premium for health coupled with taste." 
Companies may need to lower the salt, sugar and fats in their foods and yet maintain appealing tastes and textures. "Ultimately, they will change if they are forced to, either by regulation or consumer pressure," said Jason Streets, an analyst at the UBS Investment Bank in London. 
How companies react will depend in part on how well positioned they are in the market to offer healthier choices. Companies with the most to lose are those that mainly sell foods or drinks that are high in fat, sugar or salt -- like Cadbury Schweppes of Britain and Hershey Foods and McDonald's of the United States -- according to a report by J. P. Morgan Chase. The report argued that companies that are more diverse in their food lines, like Nestle of Switzerland, would find it easier to adjust. Companies that cannot spend the money to develop healthier products should consider acquiring them, the report said. 
Even foods that are considered healthy, like cereals, could be negatively affected by the European regulations. Under the proposed European Union directive, products cannot be labeled as healthy, even if they contain fortified vitamins and minerals, if the products have a high amount of sugar.
If put into effect, that change would have an impact on a company like Kellogg, based in Battle Creek, Mich. Some of its cereals would meet the proposed guidelines; others, especially those popular with children, would not. Aileen Thompson, European director of Kellogg Management Services in London, said the company would not comment on the impact of the proposed rules. 
Others companies, like Nestle; Kraft Foods of Northfield, Ill.; Unilever, the British-Dutch conglomerate; and Groupe Danone of France, are already repositioning themselves and their research and development departments to offer foods that contain healthier oils and use less salt and sugar.
But it takes time to develop the new products, and companies cannot afford to satisfy regulators but fail consumers. "That's death," said Francois-Xavier Perroud, vice president for communications at Nestle.
At an investment seminar in May, Nestle's chief executive, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, underscored the company's commitment to offering healthier foods, saying it was focusing its research in the nutritious foods he considers the growth markets. 
Sometimes, development takes years. Nestle has a line of fermented milk products called LC1 (a name derived from an active ingredient) that took 30 years to create. In 1964, Nestle microbiologists identified a bacterium, known as La1, that colonizes the digestive system and stimulates immune response. 
By 1990, Nestle had built up a strong dossier for a novel product with a proven health benefit. In 1994, it rolled out its first LC1 products in France with the claim that they reinforced natural defenses. They are now available throughout Europe, Australia and Brazil. Under the proposed European Union guidelines, LC1 would be allowed to claim a health benefit.
At the same seminar, Mr. Brabeck-Letmathe acknowledged that the nutrient profile of a diet is only one factor in a consumer's food choices. And he assured investors that Nestle had not forgotten that people also eat food for pleasure. 
THE pressure for regulation, in light of the medical costs of obesity, had raised questions about whether Nestle would stick to its confectionery business, he said. "Let me assure you," he said, "this will not change Nestle's commitment to the confectionery business."
Some companies are already reacting to the threat of lawsuits and more regulations. In early July, Kraft said it would stop promoting its products in schools and make smaller portions. It made the announcement after it was the target of a lawsuit in May by a San Francisco lawyer who wanted to block Kraft from selling Oreos to children because the cookies contain trans fats, which exist in hydrogenated oil. He soon dropped the suit, reportedly because he felt that the publicity from the action had raised awareness about trans fats.
Last September, McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., announced that it would seek a healthier alternative to the oil with trans fats that it uses to cook French fries.
Mr. Brabeck-Letmathe pledged in May that Nestle would stop marketing jumbo candy bars to children and would be clearer in its labeling. In Britain, it is removing hydrogenated vegetable fat from some confectionery. That, in turn, prompted Cadbury Schweppes to announce a review of its use of hydrogenated fats in confectionery and and other products.
Executives say they believe measures to fight obesity should be voluntary, and they point to these initiatives as proof that the industry can police itself.
But some are skeptical that companies will make real changes. Prof. Nestle from New York University noted that McDonald's said last year that it would change the kind of oil it uses, but that it still has not done so. McDonald's has said that it is carrying out tests to develop the approach that will work best. 
Amalia Waxman, project director of the World Health Organization's food initiative, said experience had shown that self-regulation was less effective than what she calls co-regulation, in which all stakeholders, including corporations, consumer groups and governments, work together to ensure that minimum standards are met.
Still, many executives at food companies reject the notion that they are the bad guys who are somehow to blame for the obesity epidemic. They say individuals have to take responsibility for what they eat and how much they exercise. 
Luis Cantarell, deputy executive vice president for Nestle's nutrition division, says there are no good foods and bad foods. "The way you use the food, the way you use the information," he said, "is another thing."

HEADLINE: Harvesting Poverty; 
The Rigged Trade Game

 BODY:
Put simply, the Philippines got taken. A charter member of the World Trade Organization in 1995, the former American colony dutifully embraced globalization's free-market gospel over the last decade, opening its economy to foreign trade and investment. Despite widespread worries abouttheir ability to compete, Filipinos bought the theory that their farmers' lack of good transportation and high technology would be balanced out by their cheap labor. The government predicted that access to world markets would create a net gain of a half-million farming jobs a year, and improve the country's trade balance.
 It didn't happen. Small-scale farmers across the Philippine archipelago have discovered that their competitors in places like the United States or Europe do not simply have better seeds, fertilizers and equipment. Their products are also often protected by high tariffs, or underwritten by massive farm subsidies that make them artificially cheap. No matter how small a wage Filipino workers are willing to accept, they cannot compete with agribusinesses afloat on billions of dollars in government welfare. "Farmers in the United States get help every step of the way," says Rudivico Mamac, a very typical, and very poor, Filipino sharecropper, whose 12-year-old son is embarrassed that his family cannot afford to buy him a ballpoint pen or notebooks for school. 
 The same sad story repeats itself around the globe, as poor countries trying to pull themselves into the world market come up against the richest nations' insistence on stacking the deck for their own farmers. President Bush deserves credit for traveling to Africa and trying to focus attention on that continent's plight. But meanwhile, struggling African cotton farmers are forced to compete with products from affluent American agribusinesses whose rock-bottom prices are made possible by as much as $3 billion in annual subsidies. Sugar producers in Africa are stymied by the European Union's insistence on subsidizing beet sugar production as part of a wasteful farming-welfare program that gobbles up half its budget. 
Instead of making any gains, the Philippines has lost hundreds of thousands of farming jobs since joining the W.T.O. Its modest agricultural trade surpluses of the early 1990's have turned into deficits. Filipinos, who like referring to their history as a Spanish and American colony as "three centuries in the convent followed by fifty years in Hollywood," increasingly view the much-promoted globalization as a new imperialism. Despair in the countryside feeds a number of potent anti-government insurgencies. Leaders who hitched their political fortunes to faith in the free market have grown bitter.
They include Fidel Ramos, who was Washington's staunch ally when he managed the Philippines' economic opening as president in the mid-1990's. Now, Mr. Ramos blames rich nations' unfair trade practices -- especially their "hidden farm subsidies and other tricks" -- for much of the suffering in the countryside. Given how long the world's economic powers have been trying to persuade the rest of the world to embrace a more open global economy, Mr. Ramos said in an interview, he was taken aback by their unwillingness to level the competitive playing field. "Poor countries cannot afford to be on the short end of this deal for long," he said. "People are in real need. People are dying." 
Mr. Ramos's plea could have emanated from any number of countries in the developing world, home to 96 percent of the world's farmers. It is a plea that needs to be heeded, before it is too late.
The United States, Europe and Japan funnel nearly a billion dollars a day to their farmers in taxpayer subsidies. These farmers say they will not be able to stay in business if they are left at the mercy of wildly fluctuating prices and are forced to compete against people in places like the Philippines, who are happy to work in the fields for a dollar a day. So the federal government writes out checks to Iowa corn farmers to supplement their income, and at times insures them against all sorts of risks assumed by any other business. This allows American companies to then profitably dump grain on international markets for a fraction of what it cost to grow, courtesy of the taxpayer, often at a price less than the break-even point for the impoverished third-world farmers. If all else fails, wealthy nations simply throw up trade barriers to lock out foreign commodities.
The system is sold to the American taxpayer as a way of preserving the iconic family farm, which does face tough times and deserves plenty of empathy, but it in fact helps corporate agribusiness interests the most. 
By rigging the global trade game against farmers in developing nations, Europe, the United States and Japan are essentially kicking aside the development ladder for some of the world's most desperate people. This is morally depraved. By our actions, we are harvesting poverty around the world.
Hypocrisy compounds the outrage. The United States and Europe have mastered the art of forcing open poor nations' economies to imported industrial goods and services. But they are slow to reciprocate when it comes to farming, where poorer nations can often manage, in a fair game, to compete. Globalization, it turns out, can be a one-way street. 
The glaring credibility gap dividing the developed world's free-trade talk from its market-distorting actions on agriculture cannot be allowed to continue. While nearly one billion people struggle to live on $1 a day, European Union cows net an average of $2 apiece in government subsidies. Japan, a country that prospered like no other by virtue of its ability to gain access to foreign markets for its televisions and cars, retains astronomical rice tariffs. The developed world's $320 billion in farm subsidies last year dwarfed its $50 billion in development assistance. President Bush's pledge to increase foreign aid was followed by his signing of a farm bill providing $180 billion in support to American farmers over the next decade. 
A fair shot, more than charity, is what poor nations need. According to International Monetary Fund estimates, a repeal of all rich-country trade barriers and subsidies to agriculture would improve global welfare by about $120 billion. An uptick of only 1 percent in Africa's share of world exports would amount to $70 billion a year, some five times the amount provided to the region in aid and debt relief.
The rigged game is sowing ever-greater resentment toward the United States, the principal architect of the global economic order. In the aftermath of 9/11, Americans have desperately been trying to win the hearts and minds of poor residents of the Muslim world. Somehow, we expect other nations to take our claims to stand for democracy and freedom more seriously than they must take our insincere free-trade rhetoric.
The beleaguered Philippine island of Mindanao is crawling with Communist and Islamic fundamentalist guerrillas, and links between Al Qaeda and the local insurgents have made the island a battlefield in President Bush's war on terrorism. There is talk of sending in American troops. But to farmers on Mindanao, home to more than two-thirds of the Philippines' corn production, subsidized American imports loom as large as any other threat. Since the Philippines joined the W.T.O. eight years ago, American corn growers have received an astonishing $34.5 billion in taxpayer support, according to an analysis of government data by the Washington-based Environmental Working Group. This helps explain how America is able to export -- the less polite word in the patois of trade would be dump -- corn at only two-thirds its cost of production. 
The resentment is intense. "The common view here is that the United States, our former colonial master, is a destructive force," said Lito Lao, the chairman of the Alliance of Farmers group in the Mindanao province of Davao Oriental. Farmers' despair, he adds, fuels the Marxist New People's Army insurgency. 
The global economy is supposed to change the world for people like Rudi and Nelly Mamac, who live with their seven children in a two-room shack on the edge of a massive plantation in Davao Oriental. The Mamacs are lucky if they clear the equivalent of $1 a day. Mr. Mamac, the sharecropper, was ready to imagine the better future promised by the great global trade game. He wishes he could afford a television and, when drawing a blank upon being asked about life beyond his corn-and-coconut-filled existence, he will wave vaguely, somewhat apologetically, toward the corner of their living space where they imagine the tube should stand.
But none of their dreams are happening. Arnel Mamac, 12, already skips plenty of school days, when his family cannot afford to buy rice. His parents don't want him making the two-mile trek on an empty stomach. One thing the Mamacs seem to realize, even without the benefit of a TV, is that the global economy they are forced to compete in is no level playing field. "It's very unfair that the American government takes so much care of its farmers while abusing those in the third world," Mr. Mamac says.
The United States and its wealthy allies will not eradicate poverty -- or defeat terrorism, for that matter -- by conspiring to deprive the world's poor farmers of even the most modest opportunities. And the threat of a devastating antiglobalization backlash set off by a widespread resentment of "northern" trade practices is enormous. Acknowledging the imminent crisis, W.T.O. negotiators labeled the current round of trade liberalization talks, begun in Doha, Qatar, in late 2001, the "development round." Any success depends on a commitment by the United States, Europe and Japan to reduce barriers to agricultural imports by 2005, and to cut subsidies. But several deadlines have already been missed. The European Union and Japan are particularly reluctant to make the painful reforms needed to make trade a meaningful two-way street, and the Bush administration has little credibility to prod them along, given its own outrageous farm subsidies. So a crucial September meeting of the W.T.O. in Cancun threatens to be a reprise of its Seattle meeting in 1999, when the last round of trade-liberalization talks stalled, and protesters outside famously threw their anti-globalization fest.
Back on Mindanao, it's a shame Rudivico Mamac cannot have his TV set to watch all those trade delegates gather in picturesque Cancun come September. After all, what they really will be discussing, notwithstanding all the mind-numbing trade jargon, is whether a global economy has room for the world's poorest farmers.

The Deficit Is Big, but Is It Bad?

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
IN the last three years, the United States government has gone from having the biggest annual surplus in its history to the biggest deficit.
 In 2000, the government made $237 billion more than it spent. This year, thanks to tax cuts, war and a weak economy, it will spend $455 billion more than it takes in, according to an estimate offered by the White House on Tuesday. 
 To offer some perspective on an unimaginably big number, that swing, of $692 billion, is more money than all the companies in the United States make in a year, more than Mexico produces each year, or about $2,400 for every American. And the deficit is growing every day. 
But what do such numbers mean? 
At first glance, it appears that deficits, a signthat the government is living beyond its means and borrowing money that would otherwise be available for more productive private investments, must be a bad thing.
"There's something deeply emotional about federal budget deficits," said Jim Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. "People seem forever inclined to latch onto government profligacy as the cause of higher rates."
Yet most economists do not think deficits are bad in principle, especially when the economy is weak, as it has been since 2001.
When growth is slow, increases in government spending can play an important role in taking the place of private demand, they say. Larger expenditures for unemployment and Social Security increase the deficit, but provide a cushion to people who have lost work. Tax cuts and rebates can also be useful, giving people more money to spend.
Besides, as a percentage of America's economy, the current deficit is still smaller than those run up in the 1980's.
So there is no reason to be alarmed, said Donald H. Straszheim, president of Straszheim Global Advisors and the former chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
"Count me on the side that says don't worry," Mr. Straszheim said. "This is largely the result of weakness in the economy."
Some analysts go further, arguing that deficits have very little impact even in the long run. If big deficits are really a sign that the government is borrowing money that private businesses need, than interest rates should rise when deficits rise, because the government would be competing with business for the same pool of money. But Japan has run enormous deficits for the last decade, swelling its national debt to more than $5 trillion, the world's largest, while Japanese interest rates have fallen close to zero. 
Similarly, in the last two years, interest rates on United States Treasury bonds have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1950's, despite the free-fall from surplus to deficit.
"You can't convincingly correlate the rate of growth in the federal debt with the level of rates," Mr. Grant said.
Based on those experiences, Mr. Grant and others argue that interest rates are much more closely related to inflation and the broader health of the economy than to the year-to-year change in government deficits. 
If overall economic growth is weak, as it has been in Japan for a decade, businesses and consumers will have little incentive to borrow and interest rates will be low, no matter how much money the government sucks up, they say. On the other hand, countries with strong economic growth should be able to finance both deficits and private investment with capital from nations where growth is weaker.
Wall Street seems to have largely adopted this blase view. Stocks have fallen fractionally since the latest deficit figures were released Tuesday, but for the year they are up 13 percent.
Other economists, however, are far less sanguine. The weak economy may have masked the effect of the soaring deficit this year, said William C. Dudley, chief United States economist for Goldman, Sachs, but if growth in the United States picks up again soon and borrowing by private businesses increases, it could become a problem.
"At that point, there isn't enough capital to go around to keep rates low if the government remains in deficit," Mr. Dudley said. Interest rates will rise, and the recovery will slow.
The problem is not so much this year's deficit as the fact that the budget outlook is also bleak in the long run, Mr. Dudley said. In addition, the Bush administration's tax cuts, which are responsible for about $180 billion of this year's deficit, mostly benefit the wealthiest taxpayers, who are less likely to spend their extra income than poorer people.
"If the tax cuts were designed to stimulate the economy, they've come up with an awful bad set of tax cuts," he said. "If that was really their goal, they could have done it in a lot better way than what they did."
Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, said he generally did not oppose deficit spending. But cutting taxes on the wealthy when the deficit is already soaring is a mistake, he said.
The White House now projects that next year's deficit will be $475 billion, and many private economists think it will be more than $500 billion. In the long run, deficits that large will probably lead to higher interest rates and slower growth, Mr. Bernstein said.
"I'm pretty nervous about the long-term implication of the deficits were building right now," he said. "They're not smart deficits, they're ideological deficits."

PERSON: John Vasil Krutilla 

HEADLINE: John Krutilla, 81, Economist Who Focused on Environment 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
John Vasil Krutilla, an economist who reckoned the dollars and cents of environmental preservation, died on June 27 at his home in McLean, Va. He was 81.
 The cause was lung cancer, his family said. 
 Dr. Krutilla spent most of his professional career, from 1955 to 1988, with Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research center based in Washington that he helped establish. There, he became an architect of natural-resource economics.
He provided cost-benefit data that underpinned his organization's pronouncements on issues ranging from forestry and fisheries to biodiversity, solid waste and land use.
A paper he wrote in 1967, "Conservation Reconsidered," provided a conceptual framework for estimating the intrinsic value of undisturbed nature. Published in the American Economic Review, it became a benchmark in the economics of conservation.
Assisted by a team of researchers, Dr. Krutilla found that the preservation of wilderness areas had economic value that could be destroyed by certain types of development.
In the 1960's and 1970's, this methodology helped to halt a hydroelectric dam project on the Snake River in Hells Canyon, at the border of Idaho and Oregon, by showing it to be economically unwise. 
In 1990, he and a colleague, Allen V. Kneese, were awarded the first Volvo Environment Prize. It cited their work to identify and quantify the consequences of water, noise and solid-waste pollution, and to develop plans to overcome them.
Dr. Krutilla was born in Tacoma, Wash., and grew up poor on a farm. He served in the Coast Guard in World War II, graduated from Reed College with a degree in economics and went to Harvard University on the G.I. Bill of Rights, earning a master's degree in 1951 and a Ph.D. the next year, both in economics.
He is survived by his wife of 49 years, Shirley Weindl Krutilla, two sons, Dr. Kerry, of Bloomington. Ind., and Kirk, of Superior, Mont.; a daughter, Kim Krutilla, of San Mateo, Calif.; and two sisters, Eva Petersen of Seattle, and Ludmilla Bloom of Tacoma.

PERSON: Anne Rogovin 

HEADLINE: Anne Rogovin, 84, a Teacher Of Mentally Disabled Children 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Anne Rogovin, a teacher of mentally handicapped children who wrote manuals on child rearing with admonitions like "Turn off the TV!" died on July 7 at her home in Buffalo. She was 84.
 The cause was brain cancer, her family said. 
 Mrs. Rogovin's years as a teacher made her a believer in letting a child learn by doing, whether it led to things made or knowledge acquired. As a classroom teaching aide she devised what she called learning boards to stimulate the senses.
She came up with more than 100 of them, evoking tastes and smells with foods and spices, or putting common utensils to their proper uses, or conjuring up weather with cardboard clouds. Her work led to two exhibitions -- "Learning By Doing" (1971) and "Please Do Touch" (1977) -- at a Buffalo gallery.
It also prompted her first book, "Learning by Doing: An Illustrated Handbook for Parents and Teachers of Children Who Learn Slowly" (Mafex, 1971; Ideal Publications, 1977). She organized workshops for parent groups, and her articles began to appear in newspapers and periodicals.
Her writings found a national response and went through various editions into the 1990's. They included "Let Me Do It!" with an introduction by Benjamin Spock (1990); "Dear Parents: Letters to Parents of Young Children" (Highsmith, 1995); "1001 Activities for Children," with a foreword by Edward Asner (Random House, 1999); and "Turn Off the TV And . . ." with a foreword by Charles Kuralt.
Anne Snetsky was born in Buffalo and graduated in 1940 from the State College for Teachers, now part of SUNY Buffalo, where she also received a master's degree, magna cum laude, in special education in 1963.
She and her husband, Milton Rogovin, suffered professionally in the 1950's as activists of the political left who protested the trial andsentencing of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Mr. Rogovin, an optometrist, lost his practice and became a nationally known documentary photographer; Mrs. Rogovin, refusing to sign the mandatory loyalty declaration, was unemployable in the Buffalo school system.
Instead, she taught mentally retarded children in the Buffalo region for the state's Board of Cooperative Educational Services for about 30 years, even as her writing career flourished.
In addition to her husband, whose work is currently on special exhibition at the New-York Historical Society, she is survived by two daughters, Ellen R. Hart of Melrose Park, Pa., and Paula Rogovin of Teaneck, N.J.; a son, Mark, of Forest Park, Ill.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 24, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Sunday about Anne Rogovin, a teacher of mentally handicapped children and an author of manuals on child rearing, misstated the current name of her alma mater, which was once the State College for Teachers at Buffalo. It is Buffalo State College of SUNY, not SUNY Buffalo.

HEADLINE: Young Foreign Workers Fill Summer Shortages 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WISCONSIN DELLS, Wis. 

 BODY:
Andresz Pietsz, an economics major in his native Poland, loves spending summers in the United States, even though his days are devoted to cleaning toilets and making beds at the Treasure Island Waterpark Resort Hotel.
 His evenings are livelier and less lonely, Mr. Pietsz says, because in addition to his hotel housekeeping job, he works full time as a counterman at a nearby McDonald's.
 "I make $600 a week here," said Mr. Pietsz, a gangly six-footer who held the same jobs last summer and hopes to be a management intern at McDonald's next summer. "In Poland, I could make maybe $100 a month in the summer." 
 As one of nearly 3,500 foreign college students drawn to this central Wisconsin resort this summer, he is part of a supporting cast without which the 140 hotels, 17 waterparks, go-kart tracks, cheese stores, T-shirt shops and restaurants would have a hard time coping. These students come mostly from Eastern Europe -- Poland, Latvia, Russia and Bulgaria -- but there are Irish and British students as well.
 "We're a town of 4,000, and there is no way we can fulfill our labor needs without using these foreign workers," said Bonnie Sierlecki, communications director of the Wisconsin Dells Visitor and Convention Bureau. 
 In Wisconsin Dells, Cape Cod, Mass., Kennebunkport, Me., Montauk, N.Y., North Carolina's Outer Banks and many other resorts, employers rely heavily on foreign college students for seasonal staffing. Last year, 253,841 foreign students came to the United States on temporary J1 work/travel visas, up 61,000 from 1998, according to the State Department. 
 Resort employers say they depend on foreigners because their resorts have a low year-round population and low jobless rate and because a limited number of Americans are willing to relocate for the jobs. 
In Key Largo, Fla., where the high season is winter, some employers recruit students from Southern Hemisphere countries like Argentina and Australia, where colleges' summer breaks are in December and January.
 Employer and employee alike talk as if it is a perfect match. The foreign students earn more money than they can earn at home, improve their English and get to visit the United States, often devoting the last week of their stay for tourism. Many managers say these students are far more dedicated and hard-working than young Americans. 
 "The American folks who come in to apply, they're not looking for service jobs where they might get dirty," said Tina Hewett, general manager of the Nonantum Resort, a 115-room hotel complex in Kennebunkport. "They want the 9-to-5 job behind the hotel desk. They don't want to use any elbow grease. These international workers are desirable to us. They have a whole different work ethic that we seem to be losing in the United States."
 At Lola's, a seafood restaurant in Martha's Vineyard, Kathy Lola Domitrovich, the co-owner, tells a similar story, saying, "American kids all start out gung-ho, but once they seem to make enough money for the summer, they say, 'It's O.K., let's go to the beach.' Kids from places where money is harder to get seem to have a different work ethic."
 But with the American economy weak and unemployment rising, not everyone is delighted about this foreign invasion. Some advocates for the unemployed complain that resort employers are not advertising in cities like Chicago and Boston to channel America's unemployed into hotel and restaurant jobs. 
 "I don't think they do an adequate job reaching out to the community," said James L. Matthis, executive director of Project Equality of Wisconsin, a Milwaukee group that seeks jobs for minorities. He disputed the notion that foreigners have a stronger work ethic than Americans. 
"There are hundreds, indeed thousands, of young people in southeastern Wisconsin and around the state who are capable of filling these jobs and working with the same tenacity," Mr. Matthis said, "and it would help them fulfill their lives' dreams as well." 
Many resort employers say they place help-wanted advertisements in large cities, but say there is little response because few Americans want to move for the summer to take $8-an-hour jobs.
"We make quite an effort to advertise to Americans, and we hire all Americans who apply who are qualified," said Tulip Pendleton, director of human resources at Treasure Island, where one-third of the 550 workers are foreign students. 
 In Wisconsin Dells, a thriving family resort, the foreign students work as waiters, lifeguards, hotel housekeepers, fast-food cooks and supermarket clerks. They account for one-third of the area's 10,000 summer seasonal workers. In the Outer Banks, about 1,500 foreign students are working this summer, and in Cape Cod, during most summers, there are more than 1,000 along with more than 2,000 nonstudent seasonal workers from the Caribbean. 
 Many employers rely on employment agencies to recruit from abroad, while some hotels use Internet advertising or place newspaper advertisements abroad. Many foreign students arrive with one job in hand and then find a second one.
 Mr. Pietsz works nearly 80 hours a week, earning $7.75 an hour, first from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. six days a week at the Treasure Island Hotel, and then from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. six days a week at McDonald's. 
 Donata Navikaite, a 20-year-old Lithuanian who studies international business, not only works 60 hours as a countergirl at Culver's, a fast-food restaurant known for its custard, but also toils 5 to 10 hours a week as a hotel housekeeper. At the Culver's on Wisconsin Dells Parkway, 14 of the 37 workers are foreign students. 
 "I plan to come back next year, which will be my third year here," Ms. Navikaite said. "I want to improve my language, to travel and to have some talking in English."
 She said she liked working here because she met many types of people and because, as someone who hoped to become an entrepreneur, she was able to observe many kinds of businesses.
 Ms. Navikaite said she loved the United States, but had one complaint. "People are more open here," she said. "They know how to have fun. But we can't even go to a bar. In Europe we can start at 18."
 Many foreign students pay agencies $500 or more to find them jobs and handle the paperwork to obtain their visas, which have become slightly more difficult to obtain since the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Their round-trip flights often cost $700 to $1,000. Many employers provide them with housing -- often for $50 a week -- but many leave it to the student to find their own housing. Nonetheless, many come out ahead because they often earn $6,000 or more in their 12 to 16 weeks here.
 Some East European students sheepishly admit that their summer jobs pay four times what their parents earn. 
"Most of them come from high-class status or else they wouldn't be able to afford to put up the money to come here," said Terri Zapuchlak, director of housekeeping at the Mayflower Motel here. "When these students started coming a few years ago, some thought they were high and mighty and were uncomfortable with all the work. Now they know they're going to have to work hard. The word has gotten out."
 Mark Obois, co-owner of House of Embers, one of the area's leading restaurants, said he began hiring foreign students a decade ago when Americans showed little interest in low-end restaurant jobs. "I wasn't getting people saying they wanted to wash dishes," he said. "The Americans would want to work in the amusement park and watch the kids. If we didn't have the European kids, we'd really be hurting."

HEADLINE: U.S. a Place of Miracles for Somali Refugees 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: TUCSON 

 BODY:
The white wooden door swung open and the dazed African villagers stepped into their new home. It was a modest apartment with secondhand furniture and a stove in need of repairs. But to Osman Yarrow, his wife and five children, refugees from Somalia's civil war, it seemed like a place of miracles.
 Clean water coursed out of gleaming faucets, an astonishing luxury for a rural family who had spent more than a decade in mud huts without indoor plumbing. "Red for hot," Mr. Yarrow repeated wonderingly as he held his fingers in the steady stream. "Blue for cold." 
 There were flush toilets instead of pit latrines and beds instead of straw mats. But what Mr. Yarrow treasured most on his first day in his American home was a sense of security. In Somalia, he witnessed the execution of his father and son by marauding militias. In Kenya, his family huddled in bleak refugee camps while bullets sang in the night. 
Here, he listened to the squeals of his children and the hum of a contraption called an air conditioner. "We will sleep without hearing gunshots," he said. "We're finally living in a safe place."
Mr. Yarrow, 40, represents the changing face of America's refugees. Since May, more than 200 members of his tribe, the Somali Bantu, have been flown to 22 cities across the United States, the first wave of one of the government's largest recent refugee resettlement efforts.
By the end of next year, officials plan to resettle nearly 13,000 Bantu, who were enslaved and persecuted for generations in Somalia until civil war scattered them to desolate and violent refugee camps in Kenya in the early 1990's.
Over the past decade, State Department officials have increasingly shifted their focus toward Africa as wars there have displaced millions of people. The end of the cold war has resulted in a sharp decline in refugees from the former Soviet Union and Vietnam. Africans are among those filling the gap.
State Department statistics show that Africans made up 3 percent of the refugees resettled in the United States in the 1990 fiscal year. By 2001, that figure was nearly 30 percent.
The pace of refugee resettlement has slowed sharply since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Thousands of refugees are awaiting security clearance because they are fleeing countries like Somalia and Sudan, which have been accused of sheltering terrorists. Even so, State Department officials say they hope to resettle more than 1,000 Somali Bantu by Sept. 30.
Families have arrived in Houston, Salt Lake City, Nashville, St. Louis, Rochester, Concord, N.H., and other cities like Tucson, where the cost of living is relatively low and entry-level jobs are available.
For the Bantu, it is a journey in both space and in time. They are members of a tribe that was forcibly transported to Somalia from Mozambique, Malawi and Tanzania by Arab slave traders two centuries ago. In Somalia, they were often denied access to education and jobs. Today, they are mostly illiterate and almost untouched by Western life. 
As refugees, they farmed, cooked, cleaned and labored in backbreaking construction jobs in the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya. But most had never flipped a light switch, operated a stove, opened a bank account or flown in an airplane.
Members of the tribe began the long process of adapting to a new culture earlier this year when the International Organization for Migration began familiarizing them with English, American culture and modern appliances while they waited in the Kakuma camp in Kenya. 
Mr. Yarrow and his family stepped off Delta Flight 3912 here this month, carrying little more than their dreams. They plunged into a sea of white faces in the airport, past the shops selling Cheez-Its and leopard-print umbrellas and the passersby who gawked at the colorful Somali dresses of Mr. Yarrow's wife and daughters.
They were welcomed by officials from the International Rescue Committee, a New York agency contracted by the government to help refugees adjust to American life. A caseworker who spoke Somali translated while other officials helped the family collect their small bags and drove them to their new home.
It was a 30-minute journey through a dizzyingly unfamiliar landscape. There were paved roads full of hurtling cars instead of dirt paths traversed by donkeys. There were strip malls and billboards instead of anthills and thorn trees.
In the apartment, the family was introduced to appliances they had never used before: a gleaming sink, a refrigerator and a stove without a working pilot light. (The landlord fixed the stove the next day.) After their flight and lessons, the Yarrows were so exhausted that caseworkers decided to leave explanations about the dishwasher and air conditioner for another day.
But before the refugee officials left, Mr. Yarrow reiterated his biggest priority. "I want to work," he said. "I want to learn English. I want to leave all my problems behind in Kenya."
His enthusiasm is clear, but challenges await him. The Bantu here are practicing Muslims in a country that has become increasingly ambivalent about Arab and Islamic immigrants.
Mr. Yarrow and his family do not speak English and cannot read or write in their own language. They are farmers looking for jobs as cleaners and fast food attendants in a slowing economy.
Some communities have expressed reluctance to accept the new arrivals. In Cayce, S.C., hundreds of people met last month at the City Council to question the decision to resettle refugees there, arguing that they would strain the city's social service agencies and schools.
State Department officials, who are responsible for refugees, say most communities welcome them. Nationally, these officials say, more than half of refugees find some form of work within six months.
Here, four Somali Bantu adults arrived seven weeks before the Yarrow family. Of those, two have found full-time jobs that pay $6.75 an hour and include health benefits, as housekeepers at a local hotel.
Officials at the International Rescue Committee say such progress is common. From the beginning, instructors prepare refugees with English classes, interview skills and job training, along with lessons about how to shop, where to bank and how the local bus system works.
These lessons are crucial. Refugees here receive assistance from the federal government for four months. After that, they are expected to support themselves. Needy families can continue to receive federal refugee assistance for several months and more from the state after that, but that is discouraged.
"When they realize our support is going to stop, that's when they will feel the pressure," said Miro Marinovich, the Tucson coordinator for the International Rescue Committee.
"But I am very positive about this group," Mr. Marinovich said. "Their willingness to learn and their willingness to work: That's what I believe will carry them through."
Abkow Edow and his wife, Madina Idle, who arrived seven weeks before the Yarrows, offer a glimpse of the thrills and frustrations of ordinary life here. They have opened bank accounts, taken the bus and learned to operate their stove. 
They have also learned about the minimum wage and the 40-hour workweek. Mr. Edow, who was a truck driver in Somalia, seems poised to get a job as a steward in a hotel. He has two children and a grandson and all three have fallen in love with strawberry ice cream and American cartoons. 
But the family still tiptoes around some of the appliances.
"The oven, we're still afraid of it," confessed Mr. Edow, 55. "We're still afraid of the dishwasher. We have never seen such things in our lives."
Mr. Edow dreams of owning an auto-repair shop someday. He wants to shed his old life, just as snakes shed their skins. But at night, he still returns, in his dreams, to the violence in Somalia. Like Mr. Yarrow, he saw his father executed. The killer, he said, used a hammer and nails. He buries his head in his hands at the memory.
"We want to move forward," he said. "We want to forget the past."
On the day the Yarrow family arrived, Mr. Edow was in high spirits. He watched as Mr. Yarrow and his wife, Khadija Hussein, practiced using their first can opener on some Campbell's chicken soup and sampled their first taste of blackberry jam on white bread.
Ms. Hussein looked at the fruit spread hesitantly. Then she took a bite and smiled.

HEADLINE: Lobbying to Keep Economic Identity 

BYLINE:  By PHILLIP LUTZ

 BODY:
LONG ISLAND'S image as New York City's bedroom began to take shape almost as soon as William J. Levitt broke ground in 1947 for what was to become the prototypical postwar suburban community, Levittown. Over the years, the image has taken on mythic proportions. 
 But like many myths, this one is only partly true. The ranks of city-bound commuters have barely grown in 40 years, while the number of Long Islanders who live and work on the Island has more than doubled. Politicians, planners, economists, labor analysts and business people say Long Island has forged a separate economic identity. 
The issue of economic independence has taken on an urgency in recent weeks as Long Island fights to regain an official federal designation as a separate metropolitan area. Early last month, to the outrage of Long Island officials, the federal Office of Management and Budget downgraded Nassau and Suffolk Counties to a division of a 23-county New York City metro area, a decision that could affect the counties' ability to win federal grants, to compare the Island with other populous regions and to attract new business. Responding to the outcry, the O.M.B. late last month agreed to reopen, until Sept. 30, the period of comment on its redesignation. Long Islanders are stepping up to make their case. 
 "If you're part of Long Island's economy, if you live here, if you work here, then you know that we are not a division of New York City, as the federal government is arguing," said Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of Huntington. "We are our own independent ecosystem, and we are our own independent economy."
 Long Island's dependence on New York City as a job market has been declining steadily for four decades, said Roy Fedelem, a principal planner with the Long Island Regional Planning Board. From 1960 to 2000, the number of Long Island residents who work in Nassau or Suffolk Counties rose sharply, from 423,000 to 992,000, Mr. Fedelem said. At the same time, the number of Nassau and Suffolk residents who work in the five boroughs changed little, rising from 216,000 to 278,000. As a result, the proportion of Long Island residents who work in the city dropped by a third, to 21.5 percent from 33.2 percent in 1960.
 "Long Island has developed into an economic entity with its own center and its own dynamics," said Gary Huth, a longtime analyst with the State Labor Department. He said the O.M.B.'s reclassification "doesn't fit the pattern of what's evolving in reality in terms of the economy of the region."
 Some experts gofurther, arguing that the central-city concept itself has outlived its usefulness. "Given the outward movement of waves of economic activity, the entire concept is no longer valid, no longer a logical way of designating metropolitan areas," said Pearl Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association and a member of the delegation that in 1972 first convinced federal officials to classify Long Island a metropolitan area. "It comes a cropper when you apply it to Long Island, but I suspect that it's invalid for other areas as well."
 Mr. Israel said that the suburbs of Los Angeles and Detroit are facing the same situation as Long Island. 
No one is arguing that commuters are not important to the economic life of suburbia in general or Long Island in particular. "Long Island's economy has developed its own identity," said Christopher Jones, the director of economic programs for the Regional Plan Association, a private planning group in Manhattan, "but there are still strong interdependencies between New York City and Long Island."
 Although the number of Long Islanders who commute to New York City has not changed much in 40 years, nearly 4 in 10 of the commuters are executives or professionals. They wield an estimated 30 percent of the purchasing power on the Island, so when they cut back, the Island's retail sector feels it. 
 But it is a measure of Long Island's economic independence that it has weathered the current downturn more successfully than the city, Dr. Kamer said. "Clearly, there are divergent trends in the two economies," she said. "Either because of 9/11 or because of its undue dependence on financial services and the subsequent shakeout in financial services, New York City's economy has been severely hurt in this business downturn. Long Island's economy is flat, but we really have not been seriously hurt." 
 In the 12 months ending in May, the latest figures available, Dr. Kamer said, Long Island gained 2,200 jobs while the city lost 62,000. Unemployment has risen over the last three years in both areas, but the city's jobless rate remains twice the Island's: 7.8 percent for the city in May versus 3.8 percent for the Island.
 "The unemployment rate is based on where people live," Dr. Kamer said, "so if we were intimately linked with the New York City economy, we would have had a much higher unemployment rate among our residents. But we are not. So I think that's another piece of the puzzle showing that our economy has become relatively independent of that of New York City."
 One reason Long Island has fared better in the downturn is that its companies were less involved in high-risk Internet ventures than companies in the city, said Peter Goldsmith, the president of the Long Island Software and Technology Network, which promotes technology companies on the Island. 
 Venture capitalists were drawn more to the city, which ultimately worked to Long Island's benefit. "We didn't get aboard on the dot-coms," he said.
 So when the dot-com bubble burst, he added, "we didn't get hurt as badly as some other places."
 John Gilbert, the chief operating officer of Rudin Management, based in Manhattan, said that from the vantage point of the real estate market, the technology sectors in New York City and Long Island are "very, very different." 
 Rudin, in partnership with Cogswell Realty, has been seeking tenants for a 300,000-square-foot technology center on Sunrise Highway in Great River. Although the Great River center is similar in concept to a technology center that Rudin runs at 55 Broad Street, in the so-called Silicon Alley in Manhattan, its target tenants are demographically dissimilar. Those on Long Island are generally "more seasoned," he said. Typically, they are former employees of Grumman or other defense companies who are seeking to start businesses of their own. 
 When many of these workers were children, from the late 40's to the early 60's, Long Island could have legitimately been called a "bedroom community," Dr. Kamer said. But as the residential population increased, so did the number of businesses like banks, supermarkets and retail stores to serve them. That led to the expansion of businesses like law and accounting firms that served other businesses. The whole process moved eastward. "Certainly by the time of the 2000 census we had developed a fairly autonomous economy," she said.
 There have been bumps in the road. In the late 1980's and early 1990's, banks stopped moving their back-office operations to the Island, and other businesses laid off workers. Office vacancies soared.
 About the same time, military contractors, who had constituted the biggest sector operating independently of New York City, cut back sharply as the cold war ended. "Long Island was severely hurt" in the recession, Dr. Kamer said, adding that the Island lost 88,000 jobs in three years. 
 "Everyone was concerned about what Long Island's identity would be," said Mr. Huth of the State Labor Department. 
 A group of Long Island officials, the Bicounty Commission on Peacetime Economic Adjustment, was formed to look into the question. Headed by Mr. Israel, the group decided that Long Island should step up efforts to diversify its economy. Those efforts have borne fruit, Mr. Jones of the Regional Plan Association said. "Much of the success story of Long Island over the past decade is the extent to which it has remade its economy around technology, export industry and business services," he said. 
 Technology in particular has begun to pick up the slack. Dr. Kamer, who serves on the board of directors of the Broadhollow Bioscience Park at Farmingdale State University, said that between 1996 and 2002, the Island added a total of more than 11,700 jobs in bioscience technology, computer technology, electronics, and engineering and research services. She expects further expansion of this sector in the next decade or two.
 The Island's quest for economic independence may be coming full circle. The expansion of technology has in large part been a carryover from earlier defense work, Mr. Huth said. Now, with federal spending on the military and homeland security on the rise, the defense sector is showing new life.
 For the first time in years, Northrop Grumman showed a net gain in employment on the Island in 2002, adding 150 jobs, according to the Defense Contract Management Agency, which monitors military contractors for the Department of Defense. Northrop Grumman expects to hire another 300 workers this year to work in Bethpage, said a company spokesman, John Vosilla. 
 Like other military contractors on the Island, Northrop Grumman is advertising jobs in the want ads, and the company's Web site lists more than 100 positions available in Bethpage, mostly for engineers. 
 Mr. Israel has been trying to get the Island's military contractors to cooperate to improve their chances of winning contracts from the Defense and Homeland Security Departments. "We made a decision 10 years ago that we had to diversify to preserve our economic independence," he said. "Now we need to make a new decision to dediversify to preserve our economic independence."
 Meanwhile, he said, he is trying to reverse the Office of Management and Budget's decision to reclassify Long Island as part of the New York City metropolitan area. "I'm focused on trying to undo a bad bureaucratic decision that could eclipse our identity," Mr. Israel said. He said that the acting director of O.M.B., Augustine T. Smythe, had satisfied him that program funding for nonprofit organizations and municipalities would be preserved during the reopened period for public comment. In a letter to Mr. Israel dated June 26, Mr. Smythe wrote, "Our guidance to the federal agencies will state that if they have been using the Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas for program administrative and fund allocation purposes, the Metropolitan Division definitions would be the comparable geographic units to use under the new classification."
 But that didn't satisfy Mr. Israel's concerns about the long term. "We've got to keep our eye on the ball," he said. "We just got a new lease on life. If we don't get organized on this and focus on this and build a strategy before Sept. 30, it would be absolutely devastating, not only to our economy and not only to our identity but to the notion that we could work together for the common good."

HEADLINE: Israel's Steps to Stem Economic Slide Draw Praise and Protests 

BYLINE:  By GREG MYRE

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 19 

 BODY:
Benjamin Netanyahu is racing to revolutionize Israel's economy, and he considers it a sprint, not a marathon.
 In just over four months as Israel's finance minister, Mr. Netanyahu has cut the top income tax rate to 49 percent from 60 percent, winning cheers from the wealthy. He is making sweeping reductions in social programs, provoking protests from the poor. He is trying to raise the retirement age to 67 for all, from the current age of 60 for women and 65 for men, prompting demonstrations by older workers, and he has revamped the pension system, drawing praise from economists. 
 The national airline, El Al, is being privatized, and Mr. Netanyahu plans to reduce greatly the state's role in the telephone, electricity and banking industries. 
"We are doing two things -- making drastic reductions in the public sector and stimulating the private sector," Mr. Netanyahu said in an interview. "The country will undergo a short period of hardship as we decelerate from the old system and then there will be a great spurt of growth."
Mr. Netanyahu expects that surge in the second half of next year. In the meantime, Israel is enduring its third year of economic turbulence, one of the worst downturns in its history, and the finance minister is drawing mixed reviews.
As prime minister from 1996 to 1999, Mr. Netanyahu began efforts to open up the economy, which was prospering at the end of the decade with the high-tech boom, record numbers of tourists and growing foreign investment.
But in 2000, the high-tech bubble burst in the United States, bringing down Israel as well. Then came the Palestinian uprising in September 2000, which has stalled Israel's economy and has been a disaster for the Palestinians.
On the sidewalk outside the ivy-covered walls of the Finance Ministry, single mothers who are heavily dependent on government benefits have been camping out in tents for more than a week, demanding the restoration of subsidies.
"We can't live on what we are getting now," said Sagit Biton, a divorced, unemployed mother of four. Her monthly benefits have fallen to the equivalent of $790 from $977 as part of cuts enacted before Mr. Netanyahu's tenure, and are about to be reduced further. "I go to the unemployment office, but they don't have any jobs to offer."
With Prime Minister Ariel Sharon focused on the conflict with the Palestinians, he gave broad latitude to Mr. Netanyahu, whose economic restructuring package survived a wave of nationwide strikes and was approved by Parliament this spring.
But the protesters, numbering only a few dozen, have attracted extensive media coverage since Vicki Knafo, a divorced mother of three, walked more than 100 miles from her home to Mr. Netanyahu's doorstep to plead her case.
After criticism that he was insensitive to the hardships of the poor, Mr. Netanyahu met with Ms. Knafo. But her protest has been gaining steam and has led to similar long-distance walks to Jerusalem by impoverished Israelis from economically depressed towns.
Mr. Netanyahu's quest for a more market-oriented economy is faring much better in the office towers of Herzliya, the country's high-tech center along the Mediterranean coast, just north of Tel Aviv.
Yossi Sela, managing partner of Gemini Israel Funds, a leading venture capital firm, says the finance minister is chopping through the regulatory thicket that has long stifled Israel.
"He's trying to do the right thing by opening the economy and fixing the mismatch between the productive sector and the nonproductive sector, which has gone horribly wrong," said Mr. Sela. "We have to have a safety net for the really weak -- we can't afford to have hunger in Israel. But we can't afford to support the nonproductive sector."
Mr. Sela gauges the improved climate through the mood of foreign investors, who shunned Israel after the Palestinian uprising. In the past few months, with a new peace plan gaining some momentum, Mr. Sela is again finding a receptive international audience. "We're not seen as lepers anymore," he said.
His firm has invested in about 70 companies over the past decade, but it made no new investments in the last half of 2002. Gemini has placed seed money in three new companies this year.
The economic barometers that measure confidence support Mr. Netanyahu's aggressive approach. The stock market was up almost 50 percent in the first half of this year in dollar terms. The currency has rallied from a low of 5 shekels to the dollar last year to 4.4 today. Interest rates are falling.
However, the economic fundamentals are still bleak. The overall economy contracted 1 percent in each of the last two years and is likely to be flat this year. Unemployment is approaching 11 percent, near an all-time high. The average Israeli salary is $1,628 a month and shrinking.
Israel's economy is an odd combination of the socialist ethos that dates to the country's founding in 1948 and an entrepreneurial, high-tech sector that flourished in the late 1990's.
The government sends a monthly check directly into the bank accounts of all families with children, regardless of financial circumstances. But Mr. Netanyahu has reduced financing for the program in perhaps his most controversial cost-cutting move.
A family with five children -- not uncommon in Israel -- has been receiving $440 a month. That will fall soon to $340 and eventually to $167.
Such programs are part of a public sector that accounts for 55 percent of the Israeli economy, and has been growing, compared with the 45 percent for the shrinking private sector. Mr. Netanyahu compares it to a lean, fit man obliged to carry a heavy man on his back.
"The guy on top needs to go on a diet, and the guy on bottom needs to be cut loose," he said. "If we don't change the scenario, pretty soon we would collapse."
The liberal newspaper Haaretz, often a critic of Mr. Netanyahu, says the effort to revitalize the country's work ethic and reduce benefit programs should be supported.
"The number of Israelis who collect supplementary income allowances has grown dramatically in the last decade, far beyond population growth and even more than unemployment can account for, indicating that a culture of idleness that condones living off benefits might be evolving here," Haaretz said in an editorial.
Many working Israelis feel overtaxed, and some are critical of the benefits extended to the ultra-Orthodox, who tend to have large families headed by men who devote their lives to studying the Torah, and do not work.
But in the short term, Israelis are hurting.
The Hazon Yeshaya soup kitchens, which have four of their five branches in Jerusalem, are now serving 2,000 meals a day, up from 500 when the economic downturn began three years ago.
"We see people coming in suits and ties between job interviews," said Abraham Israel, an American businessman who moved here and established the soup kitchens six years ago.
"The health of any society is a balanced budget, and we don't have one," said Mr. Israel. "But you can't do this on the backs of the weakest sector. We are putting working people, and even middle-income people, below the poverty line. This is asking for trouble."

HEADLINE: Welcome Home, Benedict Arnold 

BYLINE:  By GAIL BRACCIDIFERRO

 BODY:
BENEDICT ARNOLD was America's most famous traitor, but some in Connecticut hope that he can serve his country, or at least his state, by luring tourists here to learn about his story.
 From Wednesday through next Sunday, a drama about Arnold, "Benedict Arnold: A Brave Revenge," will be staged in Washington Park in Groton, two blocks from where a small band of Colonial troops led by Col. William Ledyard was defeated at Fort Griswold by Arnold's British forces on Sept. 6, 1781. The production is part of Groton's centennial celebration. 
 The drama was written by John Basinger, a retired theater professor at Mohegan Community College in Norwich, Arnold's birthplace, with music by Neely Bruce, a professor at Wesleyan University. Its production is a result of years of work by Mr. Basinger and David Holdridge, a retired history and political science professor at Mohegan. Both men have a passion for outdoor historic drama, a thriving segment of the performing arts industry that has yet to make inroads in Connecticut. 
Outdoor historic drama is its own genre -- a combination of pageantry, spectacle, music, dance, drama and history. These productions are staged in 37 states, said Scott J. Parker, director of the Institute of Outdoor Drama at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which was founded in 1963 and works with communities or nonprofit groups trying to put on the shows. 
The first outdoor historic drama, Mr. Parker believes, was "The Lost Colony," the story of the mysterious colony of Roanoke. It was first presented in 1937 in North Carolina, and is still seen today. The genre took off after World War II, said Josh Gilliam, marketing director for "The Lost Colony" production, as the tourism industry grew and American families began taking car trips across the nation. 
Mr. Parker said a big appeal of the dramas is that they are entertainment for an entire family. He added that they were more likely to succeed if they were presented at or near where the events depicted happened so that tourists can get a flavor of the historic setting. 
Mr. Parker said the institute works with 30 to 40 towns at a time to develop outdoor historic dramas. 
Subjects range from the story of the Mormon settlement in Utah and the longstanding Hatfield-McCoy feud in West Virginia to the lives of notable figures like Helen Keller and Laura Ingalls Wilder.
The productions employ 5,000 nationwide, attract 2.5 million tourists each summer to various amphitheaters and have a $500 million annual economic impact on the United States, according to institute statistics.
In 1996, an institute study, paid for with money from the state and from Mr. Holdridge and Mr. Basinger, concluded that outdoor historic drama in southeastern Connecticut could bring in $20 million a year to the region, which is already home to other major tourist attractions -- for example, two Indian casinos, Mystic Seaport and MarineLife Aquarium -- and many hotels and restaurants.
Mr. Holdridge and Mr. Basinger became interested in outdoor historic drama on a vacation in Virginia, North Carolina and Ohio a decade ago when they saw the production about Roanoke as well as one about the Shawnee leader Tecumseh. They decided that tales from Connecticut's history would also make a compelling stage production.
By 1994, they settled on what they believed was the perfect subject -- the story of Arnold, the brilliant Colonial military leader who betrayed his fledgling country by resigning from the Continental Army during the American Revolution and accepting a British military commission in 1779.
Mr. Basinger, who researched and wrote the play from 1994 to 1996 with the assistance of a state grant, said the production's highlight is its depiction of the burning of New London and the Battle of Groton Heights at Fort Griswold. Mr. Arnold's troops burned the city of New London on the east side of the Thames River and captured Fort Griswold on the west side of the river.
"The dramatic highlight is the confrontation of Arnold and the people of New London," Mr. Basinger said. "He came home a hero first, and then he came home an enemy."
The men hope the production will be the first step in pursuing their dream to establish a permanent home for outdoor historic drama in New England. In 1997, they formed Connecticut Outdoor Historic Drama, a nonprofit group devoted to this goal.
The idea is that a 15-acre site on land in Ledyard owned by Mr. Holdridge's family would be leased to the group for $1 a year. A 1,500-seat amphitheater, budgeted to cost $5.7 million, would be built there. The money, the men hope, would come from the state, private donors and local corporations.
The men also hope that the skeleton of the permanent amphitheater will be built by next summer so the Benedict Arnold drama could be staged six nights a week for 10 weeks. 
The presentation of the drama this week will inaugurate a fundraising drive for the permanent amphitheater. The production alone will cost about $126,000. The group received a $25,000 grant from the Connecticut Humanities Council, as well as local foundation grants and corporate sponsorships to make the staging possible.
"We had received some good developmental money," Mr. Holdridge said. "But at a certain point, we knew we needed to let the world see what we are talking about."
With tickets selling, actors and actresses in place, musicians ready and a stage built, Mr. Holdridge said he still has a difficult time believing that his dream is becoming reality.
"On opening night, I doubt I'll be able to say anything worth quoting," he said.

A B-29 in All Its Glory
 For the last two and a half years, 85 volunteers have been busy at the New England Air Museum in Windsor Locks restoring a B-29 Superfortress with $400,000 raised by the 58th Bomb Wing Association of World War II. The plane now sits in a $1million hangar paid for by the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development and may be seen daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
 A 60-foot interior wall of the hangar has been designed as a memorial to the 58th Bomb Wing, describing in text and photographs the history of the B-29 and its function in World War II. 
The B-29 was developed by Boeing as the last and largest high-altitude, long-range bomber in the war. But to get to its targets inside Japan, islands in the Pacific had to be captured to establish air bases. This was done by flying out of bases in India and Western China, over the Himalayas. 
The New England Air Museum is at Bradley International Airport off Exit 40 of Interstate 91. Admission is $8 for age 12 and up, $7 for people over 64 and $4 for children 6 through 11. Information: (860) 623-3305.

Concert at 'Little Church'
The Little Church in the Wilderness, a 200-year-old meeting house in Killingworth, was made famous in 1939 when "Forty Years a Country Preacher," the autobiography of the Rev. George B. Gilbert, was published. 
The book brought Time and Life magazine staffers to the church for photo essays, and the plain wooden building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The church has been celebrating the installation of a new organ in 2001 with a series of annual concerts called "Four Seasons on the Organ." Each concert features an organist, other instrumentalists and vocalists. The organ being celebrated is a custom-built instrument by Karl Wilhelm Inc. of Quebec, with 636 pipes, 66 of them in wood, producing a superior sound. 
The 2003 summer concert will be held Saturday at 7 p.m., with Stephen Rapp, an organist and the musical director of St. John's Lutheran Church in Stamford; the oboist Mateusz Zechowski, a first-prize winner in the Polish National Woodwind Contest, and Jenna Zechowski, a flutist and vocalist.
The program of Baroque, Romantic and contemporary music will be followed by a reception in the church hall. Refreshments will include desserts baked by parishioners. The address is Emmanuel Episcopal Church, Emmanuel Church Road off Route 148 West. Donations will go to the organ fund.
Information: (860)663-1109.

HEADLINE: Go East, Young Man 

BYLINE:  By ADAM BOWLES

 BODY:
WILLIAR PALOMINO was still in Peru studying economics in college when his father told him there were jobs at casinos in Connecticut. But at the time, five years ago, Mr. Palomino was more interested in his studies than he was in a job.
 That changed when his father, who was already working at a casino, got visas for Mr. Palomino, his sister and mother and he found himself in Norwich. 
 "When I got here I was worried," said Mr. Palomino, 23, who now works as a blackjack dealer at the Mohegan Sun casino, the same job his father has. "I could only stay in my apartment or go outside and walk. I couldn't communicate with the other people because it's another language. The only place to find a job was the casino. It gives us good conditions, good insurance, economic stability." 
Mr. Palomino's journey to eastern Connecticut came along a well-worn path. Immigrants by the thousands are settling here, most of them attracted by entry-level jobs at Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun. 
Experts said that the newcomers -- a mix of first-time arrivals to the United States and those who already have been living in Boston, New York, and other cities -- have spawned the region's largest immigration wave since the turn of the last century. This new wave is straining the resources of the towns surrounding the casinos, especially with increased school enrollment, and has even increased property values as the new arrivals fill up the available housing."On balance the impact of this immigration is positive for Norwich," Arthur L. Lathrop, the city's mayor, said. "The advantages are the presence of a new entrepreneurial group together with many skilled workers. Of course, it does increase the load on city services. In the long run, the children and grandchildren of our immigrants will be the teachers, doctors, and other skilled professionals of Norwich's middle class."
The increase might have another bump when Foxwoods completes its $99 million expansion in the summer of 2004, adding more slot machines, more seating for bingo, a 200-seat restaurant, shops and a 2,100-space parking garage. The expansion is expected to result in about 125 new jobs.
"The fact is we do have jobs," said Joann Frank, senior vice president of human resources at Foxwoods. "Immigrants tend to gravitate toward locations where there are jobs. What we are experiencing now is no different than what our ancestors did. We offer a fairly good living here with great benefits and that's attractive to people." 
Mr. Lathrop, a former history major at Yale University and author of "Victorian Norwich," which includes an examination of previous immigration, said the current immigration wave was truly historic. 
"We won't know until the next census," Mr. Lathrop said of the exact number of immigrants in the city. "But it's thousands and thousands of people in a city of 38,000 people. The whole American dream is replaying itself, but this time people are from different parts of the world. Most succeed. Some fail."
A group of social services, health and religious leaders called the Newcomers Committee formed about two years ago to address the needs of newcomers, particularly immigrants. The group meets monthly and has organized weekly street fairs this month to welcome immigrants and expose their cultures to long-time residents. 
In Norwich, a Chinese man from New York recently opened QVS grocery, which offers American and Chinese food, because a friend told him there was a new market here for such food items as duck. He said business has been strong.
Indeed, Asians, particularly Chinese, are the fastest-growing segment of all the immigrant groups in the region. More than 2,000 Asians work at Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods, almost 10 percent of the casinos' work force. 
About half were hired in the last four years. They are mostly from Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, but most are Chinese. Some live in New York City, leaving their families at home. They travel back to New York by bus after their work week is finished.
The Asian influx here sped up after 9/11. After the attacks, 65 of Chinatown's 246 garment factories closed, or 26 percent, and nearly 8,000 people, or one quarter of the work force there, lost their jobs, according to the Asian American Federation of New York. Chinatown's slumping economy coincided with a $1 billion expansion at Mohegan Sun, completed in 2002. 
Now, with startling speed and fistfuls of cash, Asian-American investors are buying single-family homes in Montville and in many cases turning them into boarding houses, sometimes not legally, for workers at neighboring Mohegan Sun.
In the last four years in Montville, the investors, most of them of Chinese origin, have bought 44 homes for $6.6 million across Route 32 from the casino, town records show. The average price was $155,000. Seven other homes, averaging $127,000, were paid for in cash. On one street alone --Holly Hill Drive -- Asians bought 11 of the 42 homes. 
"It's very difficult to find homes that are available in that adjacent area to Mohegan Sun," said Bess Makris, who has sold real estate for Coldwell Banker in Norwich for 16 years. "It's driving the prices up."
Chinese-American investors buy homes in the same neighborhoods because their prospective tenants, as newly arrived ethnic groups have in the past, want to live near each other, said Janny Lam, a Chinese-American developer who is renovating some Norwich apartment houses. 
"This is a new area for the Asians," Ms. Lam said. "Most of them know nobody, like myself when I first came to Norwich. If they know someone they live close by, to be together."
Many of the newcomers lack cars, she said, so being able to walk to work makes the Montville neighborhoods ideal.
Ding Zhong Wang of Norwich came to the United States in 2000 after leaving his engineering job in China one month before retirement to reunite with his wife and son, who had moved to Chinatown in New York 10 years earlier. 
Before he left he had his diplomas and work papers notarized in case he could get a job in his profession. But he needs a professional license here and friends told him there were no jobs available for him because he knows very little English. In his back pocket, he still carries a Chinese business card in his wallet that identifies him as a senior electrical engineer. He keeps the card as a souvenir.
Mr. Wang moved to Norwich in August 2001 and began work at the Mohegan Sun. But even as a cleaning attendant, his casino job pays more than his engineering job in China. He makes $300 a week at Mohegan, compared to $200 a month at home. 
"I am so happy," he said of his job.
Both casinos offer English as a Second Language programs and post employee notices in several languages. Kevin C. Bogle, vice president of human resources at the Mohegan Sun, said the casino was aware of the dramatic rise of immigrants in the neighboring towns. 
"We realize that there is a lot of Asians living in Norwich working for the casinos and we offer services to assist them and if necessary to the local area if the need does arise," he said. "There have been emergencies where we've had to provide interpreters to individual schools," including interpreting school records for students.
While community leaders said they were struggling to connect with Asian families, schools certainly are getting to know the children. Schools, along with adult literacy and English as a Second Language programs, are where the costs and changes associated with the immigrant boom are the most dramatic. 
At Montville Public Schools, 30 new Asian students showed up at the start of the 2002 school year, where Asian enrollment jumped to 91 students, the fastest growth of any group, now 3 percent of the student population.
School officials scrambled to hire an English as a Second Language coordinator at $60,000 a year to accommodate the influx of immigrants.
"People are taking roots here," said Robert Thorn, the coordinator. There were 57 English language learners at the school this last year, including 23 Chinese students.
Asians also are the fastest-growing minority at Norwich Free Academy, where there were 81 such students, a 40 percent increase from 1999-2000, when there were 49 Asian students.
"The impact of the increase is more resources are being shifted toward the E.S.L. program," said James Landherr, director of curriculum and instruction. "More kids need language support. The state is calling them Asian-Americans, but in many cases they are just Asians."
A special education teacher intern has been used several times this year to interpret for Chinese students. Many Chinese students use pocket translators. 
In the last three years, the academy has added "sheltered content" courses in math, science and history, in which students not only learn the subject, but also focus on English skills. 
Mr. Landherr said the immigrant influx is giving the school an advantage.
"Many schools talk about celebrating diversity, but it's a whole lot easier to celebrate it if you live it," he said. "It's exciting."
Bonnie Hoy, 18, graduated from Norwich Free Academy in June and plans to go Lafayette College in Pennsylvania in the fall.
Her mother is from Hong Kong and her father is from China, but Ms. Hong was born in America and speaks Chinese, English and Spanish. She and her mother recently moved to Norwich from New Jersey because her mom took a job at the Mohegan Sun. She speaks Chinese at home with her mother "so we don't forget."
Ms. Hoy said that when she opened an account at Fleet Bank in Norwich, she was offered a job. Bank officials told her that lately they have had many more Chinese-speaking customers and needed a customer representative to interpret. She declined the offer to instead concentrate on her schooling.
Jim Schepker, a Fleet spokesman, said 15 to 20 percent of the customers at two of its three branches in Norwich are Asians. The bank eventually recruited a woman who speaks Chinese to work with the customers.
"We do have an active and growing Asian customer base," Mr. Schepker said. "We are seeing a much more diverse customer base than in years prior to the development of the casinos." 
At the area's schools, officials are bracing for another surge of student immigrants in the fall. 
At Norwich Adult Education, Asians, with 200 students, are now the largest ethnic group in the E.S.L. program, which has nearly doubled in two years.
"That can be an indication to get ready," said Pam Aubin, Norwich Public Schools curriculum director, referring to the expectation that as adult casino workers settle in the region, their spouses and children will follow them here, swelling enrollments. 
Already in the district, the Asian population increased from 116 students in 2001-2002 to 144 students in 2002-2003, or nearly 20 percent. In the last seven years, its percentage of the student population nearly doubled from 1.9 to 3.6, the biggest percentage growth of any group. 
Meanwhile, there are signs that the immigrant population is already growing up. For the first time, officials at Norwich Adult Education have noticed that these workers are starting to consider jobs outside the casinos. One former casino worker is now a nurses aid and another took a job in a retail store 
"About two years ago we started to hear students talking about this," said Cheryl Egan, English as a Second Language director at Norwich Adult Education. "They have the maintenance jobs, the bathroom jobs, the kitchen jobs and they are ready to do other things."

HEADLINE: MEMO FROM HARTFORD; 
So Long to the Austria of the East Coast

BYLINE:  By PAUL von ZIELBAUER; Paul von Zielbauer is a reporter for The Times and the former chief of the Hartford bureau.

 BODY:
FOR the better part of the last four years, Connecticut has been my home, professionally and personally, if not always spiritually. As the Hartford bureau chief for The New York Times, which is to say, as the commander of a sprawling one-desk operation covering roughly 20 square feet in the cramped fourth-floor pressroom inside the State Capitol, my job was to cover the daily fluctuations that mattered even to those readers who didn't live here. 
 Along the way, I also acquired two handguns and a rifle, but more about that later. 
 Despite Connecticut's size, covering news here was not easy or simple. This is a small state, but like most small things, it is full of the quiddities and contradictions that made it more complex with every article I wrote. I don't profess now to have solved Connecticut, its politics or its culture. But if, along the way, being personally condemned by a Republican governor, a leading Democratic legislator and the state's largest newspaper means anything, I'd like to think it meant I was doing my job. 
When I arrived in Connecticut, in November 1999, I confess I did not understand much about it, a point that several public officials went out of their way to make, almost with a touch of pride, in the months that followed. I also did not know what I did not know: that Connecticut was supposed to be different than other places. 
If you grow up in Illinois and go to college in Iowa, a two-hour drive gets you halfway to a county line; the only change is the angle of the sun. Setting out for Connecticut four years ago, I'm sure I felt that not much could change in the two-hour drive from New York to Hartford. 
I was wrong. Oh, so wrong.
I've since come to appreciate Connecticut as the Austria of the East Coast -- a small, fiercely independent redoubt in a region of political and economic giants, where wealthy outsiders keep vacation homes. A place where, unless your father's father was born there, you are considered a foreigner not to be fully trusted. A state where it is easy to make favorable comparisons with the outside world, but difficult to account for, if not remedy, its own gross inadequacies. 
Scandalous?
My arrival in Hartford missed the biggest political scandal of the decade by only two months. Paul Silvester, the state treasurer and a Rowland protege (more on that later), pleaded guilty in September 1999 to taking bribes from companies he gave millions of state pension-fund money to invest. I needn't have worried. Since then, Connecticut has offered up more political tragedy than New York and New Jersey together. 
Two of the five candidates who ran for statewide office on the Republicans' 1998 ticket have been indicted; Mr. Rowland's former deputy chief of staff pleaded guilty to bribing a major state contractor; the governor himself recently paid his second $2,000 fine in six years for ethics violations; mayors in two of the state's largest cities were convicted of felony crimes, and the state's quasi-public trash agency lost nearly $200 million investing in Enron. And the federal government is still involved in corruption cases in Waterbury and at least one former high-level member of Governor Rowland's administration.
If these are the news stories that make a reporter want to stay on another year or two, there are others that make him want to flee. 
Take the current $1 billion budget shortfall that has made Governor Rowland and the Democrats in the Legislature the most boring story in the state, possibly in state history. Well, on second thought, let's skip it -- polls show that it's too tedious a topic even to make fun of and that, in any event, most residents stopped listening to the partisan rhetoric before the last snow melted. 
State budget cycles are one subject I will not miss writing about. 
I did enjoy writing about what defines Connecticut against the rest of New England, and America. The state's complicated gun laws, for instance, led me toward gun ownership in 2000, for no other reason than to decide whether I'm with the N.R.A. or the Brady Bill Bunch. I still can't decide. 
I also enjoyed covering the state's political culture, where inconvenient facts displeased some of its best-known members. 
Governor Rowland once publicly complained about a long, analytical article I wrote about Hartford, calling it a "bag job" because it focused on the city's past instead of its radiantly imagined future. State Democrats complained that I made them look unduly weak and ineffective against the Republican governor schooled in the art of subtlely pummeling his political enemies. 
Most recently, there was the protege. Governor Rowland's press secretary had a well-timed fit not long ago because I'd written articles that described Mr. Silvester, the indicted former treasurer whom the governor had picked for the job in 1998, as the governor's protege. 
As diplomats might say, a robust exchange of ideas took place. Threats were made. Dictionaries were searched. And nothing happened. I stand by the word.
And now it is time to leave.

Numbers Games: Decoding the Deficit

BYLINE:  By David E. Rosenbaum

 BODY:
IF it were possible to buy deficit futures -- that is, to make an investment based on a prediction of the size of the federal budget deficit at some point in the future -- the smart money would almost certainly be on figures considerably higher than those projected by the White House.
 Last week, President Bush's Office of Management and Budget said it expected the deficit to be $455 billion in this fiscal year -- in dollar terms, by far the highest ever -- and $475 billion in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. By the administration's reckoning, the deficit will then begin to drop, to $213 billion in 2007 and $238 billion in 2008. 
 So far, the Bush administration's track record predicting deficits -- the annual difference between the government's revenues and expenditures -- has been poor.
In April 2001, three months after taking office, the administration forecast a surplus of $334 billion for the 2003 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The government could afford possibly the biggest tax cut ever, the president declared, and still have plenty left over to begin paying down the national debt. There have been two more tax cuts since, and in just two years, the budget picture has worsened by $789 billion -- from a surplus of $334 billion to a deficit of $455 billion.
The president's new budget director, Joshua B. Bolten, said last week that no one in the spring of 2001 could have predicted the main factors that led to the turnabout: the weakness in the economy and the stock market, which caused tax receipts to plunge, and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which resulted in big new spending for domestic security and military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.
But last year at this time, well after the economy and the market had faltered and the consequences of terrorism were apparent, the administration projected the 2003 deficit at $109 billion. In February, with war against Iraq seemingly inevitable, the estimate was $304 billion. The figure announced last week was more than four times as large as the forecast a year ago and half again as big as the one only five months ago.
"In every administration," said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, "the job of O.M.B. is to provide an estimate of future deficits assuming everything goes right."
Of course, everything rarely goes right. The newest forecasts do not include the cost, now running about $5 billion a month, of keeping troops in Iraq and Afghanistan after Sept. 30. 
Nor do they reflect the fact that politicians and economists from both parties agree that sooner rather than later the alternative minimum tax system must be overhauled, with a potential loss of hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. 
"If we are skeptical of your out-year projections," Representative John M. Spratt Jr., Democrat of South Carolina, told Mr. Bolten, "it's because we've been burned before." David E. Rosenbaum

HEADLINE: 'Startling' Comments 

 BODY:
In reading your article "Law to Give Charities Relief" (July 13), I noted the startling positions apparently taken by State Senator Bill Finch, a Democrat, and usually a thoughtful and measured man.
 Senator Finch, who I know from my membership on the Board of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council, is quoted in your article as saying that not taxing nonprofit organizations that house the poor, indigent, and misplaced results in "socking the middle class again." Further, in the context of this article, he appears to be charging that these charitable organizations are "wealthy" by stating that "there isn't the wherewithal in the Legislature to do what everyone knows will balance the budget, and that's tax the wealthy." 
 If this statement was not intended to draw these nonprofits into the ranks of the wealthy, then perhaps it was meant to create class warfare. This, of course, will not happen in Bridgeport, where as the president of the Bridgeport Economic Development Corporation, Senator Finch is well aware that the wealthy of any stripe are noticeably absent. 
If it were not for the services provided by charitable organizations such as the Bridgeport Rescue Mission and the Janus House project of the Council of Churches of Greater Bridgeport (on whose board I also sit), Bridgeport would be facing yet another great crisis: substantially increased, unattended homelessness. That would really be "socking it to the middle class!" It might be better for Senator Finch to focus on the completion of some of the many projects Bedco has on its drawing boards or under a partial state of completion (such as the ArtSpace project, on which I feast my eyes each time I look out of my office window). The content of Bridgeport coffers, as well as its reputation, will be much more improved by attracting new residents and businesses that will pay taxes, than by complaining about legislation that prevents the city from taxing charitable abodes for the needy.

HEADLINE: Why Liberals Are No Fun 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
IT wasn't in prime time, and the ratings weren't even on the charts. But in the 24/7 broadcasting arena of political talk, where liberals are on the losing side at least 22/7, they must take whatever scraps they can get. For them, it was a rare red-letter day when Al Franken, appearing on Book TV on C-Span 2, landed a rhetorical uppercut to the jaw of Liberal Nemesis No. 1, Bill O'Reilly, and left him even more senseless than usual.
 The setting was a panel at the annual booksellers' convention in Los Angeles last month. Mr. Franken was on hand to hawk his fall book, "Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right." Mr. O'Reilly, plugging his forthcoming "Who's Looking Out for You?," was not overjoyed to find his face among the lying liars (George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Ann Coulter) on Mr. Franken's book jacket. It was downhill from there. After Mr. Franken took the mike to delineate the lies at issue, Mr. O'Reilly started calling his adversary an "idiot" and shouting "Shut up!" Such grace under fire was not so much Reaganesque as Baxteresque, after Ted Baxter, the preening local anchor of the late, great "Mary Tyler Moore Show." 
 But of course this liberal victory over a conservative blowhard was short-lived. Despite their domination of the entertainment industry, liberals barely have a foothold in the part of show business they are most exercised about. Barbra Streisand may have a contentious Web site, but Rupert Murdoch has an empire. As David Brooks put it recently in Mr. Murdoch's Weekly Standard, Democrats are in "despair that a consortium of conservative think tanks, talk radio hosts and Fox News -- Hillary's vast right-wing conspiracy -- has cohered to form a dazzlingly efficient ideology delivery system that swamps liberal efforts to get their ideas out." This week brought the news that Rush Limbaugh had even infiltrated ESPN's "Sunday N.F.L. Countdown" as a new cast member. And so liberals plot and dream, with the undying hope that their own Rush or O'Reilly or Hannity might turn up as miraculously as Lana Turner supposedly did at the Schwab's Pharmacy soda fountain.
Even as Mr. Franken was goading Mr. O'Reilly, he was talking with AnShell Media, a $10 million start-up financed by Chicago venture capitalists determined to create liberal talk radio programs for syndication. In late June, Time broke the story that Al Gore was recruiting other money men to help float a cable network that might offer some kind of an alternative to Fox News. Given Mr. Gore's own TV track record during the 2000 debates -- wearing more pancake makeup than Milton Berle in drag and talking incessantly about a "lock box" -- this mission seems as quixotic as Al Sharpton's presidential campaign, though considerably less entertaining. Sure, Mr. Gore is unlikely to be an on-camera personality in this enterprise, but even so, his show business resume consists mainly of having not been an inspiration for "Love Story" while at Harvard.
How can Democrats be so ineffectual in the media in which they would seem to have a home-court cultural advantage? The talk-show playing field is littered with liberal casualties: Mario Cuomo, Alan Dershowitz, Phil Donahue. Why waste money on more broadcasting flops? The conventional wisdom has it that liberals will never make it in this arena because they are humorless, their positions are too complicated to explain, and some powerful media companies (whether Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation or the radio giant Clear Channel) want to put up roadblocks.
Others argue that liberals are so down and out that they don't even know what they believe any more. "The reason conservative media outlets work is that they have a mass audience united by a discrete ideology," says Tucker Carlson, who affably represents the right on CNN's "Crossfire" and is one of those I've queried about this topic in recent months. "They believe in nine things. They all know the catechism." In Mr. Carlson's view, Democrats are all over the ideological map in the post-Clinton era, and there can be no effective media without a coherent message.
But the case against liberal talk success isn't a slam-dunk. After all, conservatives have their talk-show fiascos too, as evidenced by MSNBC, the lame would-be Fox clone that, as the comedian Jon Stewart has said, doesn't "deserve all those letters" in its name. MSNBC's just-canceled right-wing star, Michael Savage, drew smaller audiences on the channel than Mr. Donahue did. What's more, there actually are liberals who retain a sense of humor (witness Mr. Franken, Mr. Stewart and Michael Moore), while conservative stars are not infrequently humor-free (witness Mr. O'Reilly).
Norman Lear goes so far as to argue that liberals are intrinsically funnier than conservatives. "Most comedy comes fromthose who see humor in the human condition," he says. "Most who traffic in the stuff could be called humanists. The far-right talk hosts spew a kind of venom and ridicule that passes for funnybone material with the program executives that hire them."
If humor doesn't bring liberals talk-show success, is the problem that they lack rage? Cal Thomas, the conservative columnist and Fox host, speaks for many when he argues that "liberals don't have the anger" that conservatives have stored up from their years in the political and media wilderness. But this, too, is changing: Pinch most Democrats these days, and they'll vomit vituperation about President Bush as crazed as that of some Clinton haters of a decade ago. The catechism that liberals believe in is arguably more or less as rigid as the conservative catechism, too: a multilateral foreign policy, affordable health care, a progressive tax code, pro-environmental regulation, pro-choice, etc.
Nor is the political complexion of media moguls necessarily an index of what political ideas they promote or stifle. It's Regan Books, an imprint of Mr. Murdoch's HarperCollins, that published Mr. Moore's best seller, "Stupid White Men." Meanwhile, it is a more progressive media gatekeeper, Bill Gates's Microsoft, that is a co-owner of MSNBC, on which Mr. Savage told a "sodomite" caller to "get AIDS and die."
In the end, the line that separates those who succeed and fail in talk TV and radio may have nothing whatsoever to do with ideology and everything to with show business. "It's hard to put a TV show together, let alone 24 hours of programming," Mr. Franken says. "Roger Ailes was a great hire for Fox. You need a showman. Fox had the idea you could do a cable news network that actually had an agenda, and no one had thought of that before."
It's a good point, because while Mr. Ailes is mainly known among political types as a media handler for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, he has equally telling roots in show-biz. He helped make a bland entertainment talk-show host, Mike Douglas, into a star in the 1960's, and learned producing under the wing of the legendary Broadway impresario Kermit Bloomgarden, whose musical hit "The Music Man" could be read as the ur-text for the shameless showmanship of Fox News Channel. At Fox, Mr. Ailes invented not only agenda-driven news ingeniously branded "fair and balanced" but also "the whoosh": that sound that announces the arrival of a new headline. The whoosh may be idiotic, but TV wasn't long ago christened the idiot box for nothing. Idiocy can be fun.
If showmen as shrewd as Mr. Ailes are rare, so are performers with the particular star quality suited to broadcast talk, says Harry Shearer, the liberal radio satirist ("Le Show"), "Simpsons" voice and Christopher Guest collaborator (most recently on "A Mighty Wind"). He argues that "based on sheer radio professionalism," even "a tribe of chimpanzees locked in a room would choose Rush Limbaugh over Jim Hightower," the Texas populist whose radio show has been an also-ran on the national charts.
"Hightower has a fine record as a left politician in Texas, which is not easy to do," Mr. Shearer says. "But he has a voice like a cat being wrung through a dryer at slow speed, and he has no show business chops. Rush Limbaugh didn't start in politics. He was Rusty Limbaugh, playing the top-40 hits. He learned the craft of broadcasting first."
Al Franken, like Ann Richards, Molly Ivins and other entertaining liberals, is a polished performer without a deep history on radio. He says that were he to take on the job oftalk host, it would take over his life, and even then, he could fill only a few hours of the broadcasting day. It's not clear if any other performing talents are on tap to shoulder the rest. Tipper Gore's past campaign against rock lyrics doesn't augur well for Gore TV luring pre-A.A.R.P. talents or viewers. The best hope may be for Janet Reno to reconvene her "Dance Party" from "Saturday Night Live."
Then again, maybe the only real hope for liberals is just a cyclical change in the political environment. As the press keeps asking what President Bush knew about his own State of the Union speech and when he knew it, his approval rating has started sinking to its pre-9/11 level. The unemployment record on the administration's watch keeps heading into Herbert Hoover territory. This may explain why Mr. Franken's forthcoming book was at 550 in the sales rankings at Amazon.com when I checked it early this week, while Mr. O'Reilly's was languishing at 24,574. Timing is everything in politics, just as it is in show business. Should this realignment continue, Bill O'Reilly might yet have to face down competition from a liberal talk-show host with an equally self-infatuated TV presence. "The Andrew Cuomo Factor," anyone?

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Suddenly, Greenspan Is, Well, Mortal

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
LIKE the statues of dictators, investment icons have toppled one by one since the stock market peaked in 2000. Chief executives, once lionized by their shareholders, are now often viewed with mistrust. Stock analysts who were once Wall Street's equivalent of rock stars are now seen as carnival barkers.
 But through it all, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, kept deity status. Not long ago, one lawmaker predicted that Mr. Greenspan would be remembered as the greatest central banker of all time. Even after years of falling stock prices, the Fed chairman was a man that investors still found worthy of worship. 
 Until last week, that is, when the bowing and scraping stopped. And from Washington to Wall Street, deep skepticism took its place.
Last week, Mr. Greenspan visited Capitol Hill for his regular testimony on monetary policy. It was not the usual love fest. He was questioned sharply by some lawmakers, who appear to have grown tired of waiting for the economic recovery that he has regarded as imminent for almost two years now.
Some of the hostility was politically motivated, of course. Most of the toughest questioning came from Democrats and an independent; they expressed concerns about burgeoning deficits, rising unemployment and low rates for savers. But the hectoring, nonetheless, represented a significant shift.
On Wall Street, Mr. Greenspan's comments prompted a sell-off in Treasury securities, pushing up interest rates significantly. Stocks also fell. Bond traders did not like his tepid promise, made in his first day of testimony, to keep monetary policy accommodating as long as necessary. Indirectly, he made it clear that the minute the economy picks up, rates will rise. And some traders noted how odd it seemed that he mentioned nothing about deflation, a popular Fed topic recently. Jawboning about deflation by Fed officials helped propel interest rates to their lows in mid-June.
Doug Kass, a hedge fund manager at Seabreeze Partners in Palm Beach, Fla., said the reactions last week from both Washington and Wall Street were a watershed. "Chairman Greenspan has now officially lost the confidence of the bond market," he said. "Market participants are now going to begin questioning past cycle and current cycle policies by the Fed."
MR. GREENSPAN said that the bond market's move indicated that traders, too, saw signs of an economic recovery. But some bond traders disputed this assessment and said the move showed the market's concern over rising trade and budget deficits, and the inflation risks that will result from the Fed's ballooning of the money supply.
By driving rates so low, Mr. Greenspan has created two new manias, one in bonds and one in real estate, Mr. Kass said. "The Fed has been unwilling to accept a normal business cycle," he added. "It's relying on extending overvalued assets in order for consumption to be continued at very high levels."
Now, interest rates are rising, threatening an economy kept moving only by heavily leveraged consumers. For example, homeowners' equity as a percentage of their real-estate holdings is at 55.2 percent, according to Federal Reserve figures. In 1982, homeowners' equity stood at 69.9 percent. Homeowners have been taking equity out of their homes and spending it. If mortgage rates rise, home prices will fall, driving down this equity stake even further.
"Once you start down this path of not letting the destructive side of capitalism work, you build a bigger and bigger edifice so each time you've got to bet the ranch to make sure it doesn't collapse." said Bill Fleckenstein, head of Fleckenstein Capital in Seattle. "Everyone has believed for at least 5 or 10 years that Greenspan could wave his magic wand and fix any problem. When people start to turn on him, that's when the music finally stops."

Peacekeeping Is Back, With New Faces and Rules

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
PEACEKEEPING is no longer a dirty word in Republican Washington. The United States is appealing to other countries to share the military burden of the occupation of Iraq, and President Bush is also signaling his willingness to send American troops to West Africa to help pacify Liberia.
 But as peacekeeping, like bell-bottoms, comes back into fashion, it is now cut from a different fabric than before. The missions are longer, and the troops are more likely to come from developing countries. 
 In its original missions, United Nations troops were likely to be the first force on the ground, after combatants had agreed to step back. 
But in the last four years, urgent humanitarian crises in the eastern Congo, Sierra Leone and East Timor have required new tactics. Military action is needed more quickly than a United Nations blue-helmeted force can be authorized and deployed. In these knotted conflicts, ad hoc multinational forces have taken the lead, with the United Nations' blessing, and they have been led by developed countries -- the British in Sierra Leone and the French in the Ivory Coast, for example. 
Their tenure tends to be measured in weeks or months, while the tenure of United Nations' forces, which follow the multinational forces, tends to be measured in years. The United Nations' forces also tend to come from countries with less substantial economies, though they usually have substantial militaries. On June 30, the top contributors to peacekeeping missions were Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Ghana. Together, they contributed 13,826 troops, military observers and policeman. 
The five permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- together contributed a total of 2,097, less than all the individual countries but Ghana.
Does it matter? After all, the countries with the most robust economies are paying most of the bills. The United States, in the current fiscal year, is paying 27 percent of the United Nations peacekeeping budget of $2.17 billion.
"There are countries that support peacekeeping in a big way, with a lot of money, and countries that support it with flesh and blood," said Jean-Marie Guehenno, the United Nations under secretary general for peacekeeping operations, in a recent interview. 
While the movement in this direction has been going on since at least the mid-1990's, "I do hope we are in a trough, not a trend," he said. This divide "could create some resentment."
Indeed, if the military intervention is to have any meaning, it must display international backing of all sorts, said David Rudd, the president of the Canadian Institute for Strategic Studies. 
"It's all well and good to support an operation financially," Mr. Rudd said, but "if you subscribe to the notion of some form of global community, this demands and equitable sharing of the risks."
But Paul F. Diehl, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said that the increasing dominance of developing countries is not a major issue if their forces have the military capability and are seen as legitimate, not interlopers with their own agenda. (Which makes Nigerian forces a problematic presence when it comes to West African peacekeeping.)
For the major troop contributors, there are rewards -- peacekeeping dividends, if you will. Pakistanis and Indians believe "that peacekeeping adds to the military experience," Mr. Guehenno said. "To be able to hold fire in a difficult situation requires a lot of training."
And then there is a more tangible dividend: Mr. Guehenno's office reimburses the countries that provide troops at the rate of $1,100 per soldier a month. Often, the cost to the country providing the troops is significantly less. "Generally, it is a substantial and generous differential," said Tariq Chaudhry, a peacekeeping specialist at Pakistan's mission to the United Nations. "But that's not why we go into it. We are actually quite proud of our record, proud that we've got peacekeeping right."
Economic incentives may become more explicit. In Iraq, the Pentagon is considering a plan to train private Iraqi security force to guard pipelines, government buildings and other sites. And now, most of the 500-strong police force the United States has serving in Kosovo are employees of a private firm, DynCorp.
Indeed, the notion of privatizing peacekeeping is getting more attention. In the June and July issue of Policy Review, published by the Hoover Institution, P. W. Singer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote that the growing industry of private military firms could be tapped to protect humanitarian aid workers or to intervene "whenever recalcitrant local parties break peace agreements or threaten the operation." They could even take over the whole operation, as a coalition of private security companies offered to do in the Congo, for $100 million or more.
Privatization, unsurprisingly, has many critics. In his article, Mr. Singer warned that "outsourcing also entails turning over control of the actual provision of service. For peacekeeping, this means the troops in the field are not part of national armies, but private citizens hired off the market, working for private firms. Security is now at the mercy of any change in market costs and incentives."
For his part, Mr. Guehenno said he was worried that privatization offered the wrong message. "With private troops, the first signal you send is: This is important, but not important enough to risk our own people," he said.

HEADLINE: Bush Predicts That His Tax Cuts Will Soon Produce More Jobs 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Texas, July 19 

 BODY:
President Bush predicted today that tax cuts would provide the kind of lift for the struggling United States economy that would lead to job creation.
 While the White House hopes for faster economic growth in the next 18 months, the stubbornly high unemployment rate, currently at 6.4 percent, remains a drag on the economy and threatens to complicate Mr. Bush's bid for re-election in 2004. 
 "Now that Americans can keep more of what they earn, we can expect to see rising demand for goods and services," Mr. Bush said in his weekly radio address. "And as demand increases, companies will need more workers to meet it." 
The United States Treasury next week will begin printing and mailing more than 25 million child tax credit checks worth $12 billion, part of the recently enacted Jobs and Growth Act that increased the child tax credit to $1,000 from $600 per child for qualifying families.
In addition, reduced income tax rates have taken effect.
"There are hopeful signs that our actions are contributing to economic growth," Mr. Bush said. "Individual investors are showing greater confidence, leading to a significant rise in the stock market."
Analysts have been encouraged by positive housing and manufacturing reports but say the unemployment numbers, although affected by seasonal factory shutdowns, are worrisome.
The White House this week projected a record $455 billion budget deficit for this year and $475 billion for next year, which the president's aides attributed largely to a drop in tax revenue due to the weak economy and additional spending for the war on terrorism.
Democrats believe the government's deep financial hole is exacerbated by the tax cuts and that Mr. Bush has no plan to reduce the deficit other than pushing for economic growth that would increase tax revenues.
But Mr. Bush said, "My administration remains focused on faster economic growth that will translate into more jobs." 
He said he would try to hold government spending to a relatively modest 4 percent increase in the 2004 fiscal year, a goal that might be difficult given new demands for financing, like the Medicare prescription drug benefit that Congress is negotiating with the White House.
"I urge Congress to make spending discipline a priority, so that we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years," Mr. Bush said.

HEADLINE: NORTH KOREA HIDES NEW NUCLEAR SITE, EVIDENCE SUGGESTS 

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER with DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19 

 BODY:
American and Asian officials with access to the latest intelligence on North Korea say strong evidence has emerged in recent weeks that the country has built a second, secret plant for producing weapons-grade plutonium, complicating both the diplomatic strategy for ending the program and the military options if that diplomacy fails. 
 The discovery of the new evidence, which one senior administration official cautioned was "very worrisome, but still not conclusive," came just as North Korea declared to the United States 11 days ago that it had completed reprocessing 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods, enough to make a half dozen or so nuclear weapons. 
 American officials have said they cannot verify that claim, though they confirm that sensors set up on North Korea's borders have begun to detect elevated levels of krypton 85, a gas emitted as spent fuel is converted into plutonium. 
What concerns American, South Korean and Japanese analysts, however, is not simply the presence of the hard-to-detect gas but its source. While American satellites have been focused for years on North Korea's main nuclear plant, at Yongbyon, the computer analyses that track the gases as they are blown across the Korean Peninsula appeared to rule out the Yongbyon reprocessing plant as their origin. Instead, the analysis strongly suggests that the gas originated from a second, secret plant, perhaps buried in the mountains. 
American officials have long suspected that North Korea would try to build a second plant to protect itself against a pre-emptive strike by the United States. The United States even demanded an inspection of one underground site five years ago, only to find it empty, but this is the first time evidence has emerged that a second plant may be in operation. 
"This takes a very hard problem and makes it infinitely more complicated," said one Asian official who has been briefed on the American intelligence. "How can you verify that they have stopped a program like this if you don't know where everything is?" 
Indeed, there may now be at least two hidden facilities with the capacity to produce material for nuclear weapons. In October, confronted with American evidence, North Korean officials admitted that they had clandestinely built a plant intended to produce uranium, another fuel for a bomb. (It is the same approach Saddam Hussein tried in the early 1990's, and that Iran is pursuing today.) American officials say they have never found that plant, though they believe it is still a few years away from full-scale production. 
If it turns out that the current evidence is being properly interpreted, and a second plutonium plant also exists, President Bush may not even have the option that President Bill Clinton briefly considered in 1994: using a military strike or sabotage to prevent North Korea from producing significant amounts of weapons-grade material. Still, Mr. Bush has vowed that he "will not tolerate" a nuclear North Korea. 
American intelligence officials say they are wary about making any final judgments about the new evidence. They are keenly aware that C.I.A. assessments of Iraq's nuclear program have touched off a national debate over whether intelligence was exaggerated, and have made all the agency's findings suspect. 
That issue has also put the White House at odds with George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, who knows that the White House is going to extraordinary lengths to avoid calling the nuclear confrontation with North Korea a crisis. So far, White House officials have been told only informally of the new evidence and have not been fully briefed about its potential implications, administration officials say. 
But each week the White House's effort to sound low-key is being undercut by both North Korea's aggressive statements and new evidence that the country is now driving toward production. On Friday, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, who angered the White House by questioning its evidence about Iraq, expressed grave concerns about North Korea.
The situation in North Korea "is currently the most immediate and most serious threat to the nuclear nonproliferation regime," he said from his headquarters in Vienna. It is not clear if he was aware of the newest evidence when he spoke.
North Korea's stance regarding its nuclear program is strikingly different than Iraq's was. After the North Korean government threw out I.A.E.A. inspectors on New Year's Eve, its government acknowledged -- even boasted of -- its nuclear weapons program. The Bush administration has suspected that some of the claims amount to bluffing, an effort by North Korea to force the world to give it aid on its terms in return for re-freezing, or perhaps dismantling, its program. Mr. Bush has called the country's efforts "blackmail," and he said he would not give in. 
But behind the scenes, the North Korean declarations have hardly been dismissed. American intelligence officials have been pouring tremendous resources into solving a mystery: how could North Korea claim that it has reprocessed all of its 8,000 rods if the one known reprocessing plant, at Yongbyon, has been operating only sporadically?
At the C.I.A. and the National Security Council, senior officials have long expressed concern that they could be missing something, that a second plant could be buried somewhere, though that would pose a number of technical challenges. Those fears have been heightened by reports from South Korean intelligence that one of its agents -- whose reliability is unknown -- reported the existence of a second plant, northeast of Yongbyon. 
North Korea has an estimated 11,000 to 15,000 deep underground military-industrial sites, according to one American intelligence estimate, and the nation's leadership has a history of constructing duplicate facilities for such important capabilities as tank production or command-and-communications systems.
"If you follow their logic, if we find a second reprocessing location, maybe there are more," said one American official. "It is a reasonable assessment, given North Korea's proclivity to have multiple facilities for every critical aspect of its national security infrastructure." 
Similar logic, of course, led the American intelligence agencies to some of their conclusions about Iraq. But North Korea has a far more sophisticated nuclear program, built over the years with the help first of China and Russia, and in the case of uranium production, Pakistan. 
China has now become fully engaged in trying to come up with a diplomatic solution that would not cause chaos on its border with North Korea, or an influx of refugees. A senior Chinese official, Deputy Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo, who has long experience with North Korea, spent an unusually long time -- two and half hours -- meeting with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other American officials on Friday. He also saw Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, and Vice President Dick Cheney.
The issue is the administration's demand that South Korea and Japan be part of any negotiations with North Korea, which wants to deal only with the United States. 
But some administration officials, especially at the Pentagon, believe that negotiations, while necessary, will ultimately prove fruitless. They do not believe that North Korea will ever trade away all of its nuclear program, the only card the starving country has to play to compel the world's attention. 
Mr. Bush has said he would not settle for another nuclear freeze, like the one Mr. Clinton approved in 1994, and he has insisted that all North Korean nuclear facilities must be dismantled. Mr. Bush has also come under increasing criticism for letting the problem fester too long as he dealt with Iraq, a view voiced by former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry this week. 
Yet it is unclear what Mr. Bush may consider if diplomacy fails. He is already organizing more intrusive inspections of ships and planes, hoping to step up economic pressure on North Korea.
But for military planners, should Mr. Bush decide that American security requires a pre-emptive attack, any confirmation of additional weapons facilities vastly complicates the work of singling out those facilities, since there may be no certainty that all of the important locations have been found. 
If any secret facilities have been operating, their production of fissile material may have already spread in small quantities to any number of other locations. The C.I.A. concluded in the early 1990's that North Korea might possess two crude weapons already, but it has never confirmed that. 
Such uncertainties remain. The worst case is that the spent fuel rods have been moved to a previously undiscovered reprocessing plant, where the plutonium has been extracted and already shipped around the nation in five- to eight-kilogram packages for weapons production.

HEADLINE: The Next Debate: A Qaeda Link 

BYLINE:  By Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon; Daniel Benjamin, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and Steven Simon, an analyst at the Rand Corporation, are authors of "The Age of Sacred Terror."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In all the debate over the disputed claims in President Bush's State of the Union address, we must not forget to scrutinize an equally important, and equally suspect, reason given by the administration for toppling Saddam Hussein: Iraq's supposed links to terrorists. 
 The invasion of Iraq, after all, was billed as Phase II in the war on terror that began after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But was there ever a credible basis for carrying that battle to Iraq? 
 Don't misunderstand -- we should all be glad to see the Iraqi people freed from Saddam Hussein's tyranny, and the defeat of Iraq did spell the demise of the world's No. 4 state sponsor of international terrorism (Iran, Syria and Sudan all have more blood on their hands in the last decade). But the connection the administration asserted between Iraq and Al Qaeda, the organization that made catastrophic terrorism a reality, seems more uncertain than ever. 
In making its case for war, the administration dismissed the arguments of experts who noted that despite some contacts between Baghdad and Osama bin Laden's followers over the years, there was no strong evidence of a substantive relationship. As members of the National Security Council staff from 1994 to 1999, we closely examined nearly a decade's worth of intelligence and we became convinced, like many of our colleagues in the intelligence community, that the religious radicals of Al Qaeda and the secularists of Baathist Iraq simply did not trust one another or share sufficiently compelling interests to work together. 
But Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld promised that the Bush administration had "bulletproof evidence" of a Qaeda-Iraq link, and Secretary of State Colin Powell made a similar case to the United Nations. Such claims now look as questionable as the allegation that Iraq was buying uranium in Niger. 
In the 14 weeks since the fall of Baghdad, coalition forces have not brought to light any significant evidence demonstrating the bond between Iraq and Al Qaeda. Uncovering such a link should be much easier than finding weapons of mass destruction. Instead of having to inspect hundreds of suspected weapons sites around the country, military and intelligence officials need only comb through the files of Iraq's intelligence agency and a handful of other government ministries. 
Our intelligence experts have been doing exactly that since April and so far there has been no report of any proof (and we can assume that any supporting information would have quickly been publicized). Of the more than 3,000 Qaeda operatives arrested around the world, only a handful of prisoners in Guantanamo -- all with an incentive to please their captors -- have claimed there was cooperation between Osama bin Laden's organization and Saddam Hussein's regime, and their remarks have yet to be confirmed by any of the high-ranking Iraqi officials now in American hands. 
Indeed, most new reports concerning Al Qaeda and Iraq have been of another nature. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Abu Zubaydah, the two highest-ranking Qaeda operatives in custody, have told investigators that Mr. bin Laden shunned cooperation with Saddam Hussein. A United Nations team investigating global ties of the bin Laden group reported last month that they found no evidence of a Qaeda-Iraq connection. 
In addition, one Central Intelligence Agency official told The Washington Post that a review panel of retired intelligence operatives put together by the agency found that although there were some ties among individuals in the two camps, "it was not at all clear there was any coordination or joint activities." And Rand Beers, the senior director for counterterrorism on the National Security Council who resigned earlier this year, has said that on the basis of the intelligence he saw, he did not believe there was a significant relationship between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda.
The Congressional oversight committees evaluating the administration's use of intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have said they will also examine whether the administration manipulated information regarding Iraq's involvement in terrorism. The terrorism issue must not be given short shrift because of the current controversy over claims of Iraq's unconventional weapons. The truth is, we knew for decades that Iraq had nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs -- yet it was only after 9/11 that these programs were viewed as an intolerable threat that necessitated a regime change. 
This is not only a question of political accountability -- it also bears on our nation's fundamental approach to security. United States policy changed dramatically when the Bush administration, lacking compelling evidence of an Iraq-Qaeda link, decided to base the Qaeda part of its pro-war argument on a hypothetical situation. "Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists," President Bush said in October. "Alliance with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints."
But this scenario is extremely unlikely. For years now the world's leading state sponsors of terrorism have had no confidence that they could carry out attacks against the United States undetected. That is why this brand of terrorism has been on the wane. 
After it became clear to Libya that the United States could prove its responsibility for the 1988 attack on Pan Am 103 -- and United Nations sanctions were imposed -- it got out of the business of supporting attacks on Americans. After American and Kuwaiti intelligence traced a plot to kill former President George H. W. Bush in 1993 to Baghdad, the Iraqi regime also stopped trying to carry out terrorist attacks against America. And when the Clinton administration made clear that it knew Iran was behind the 1996 bombing of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, Tehran ceased plotting terrorist strikes against American interests. 
Because of America's intelligence and law enforcement capacities, the world's outlaw states know that they will pay a high price for sponsoring terrorists act against us -- and an overwhelming one should they assist in attacks involving weapons of mass destruction. That is why Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria and some 20 other countries with chemical and biological weapons have never, as far as we know, given one to terrorists. 
Of course, the return of state-backed terror against America cannot be ruled out. And we are right to be concerned that North Korea, the world's most unpredictable regime, might sell a nuclear weapon to terrorists. But this much is clear: all states, even rogue ones, have a strong conservative impulse for self-preservation. 
American policy must recognize this clear division between the old state-sponsored terrorism, which we have shown we can deter, and the new, religiously motivated attacks. First, we should think long and hard before seeking regime change as a means of behavior modification. Those who chafe to topple the mullahs in Iran, for example, court unforeseen consequences that may ultimately damage America's interests. 
If we were to confirm that extreme elements like the Iranian Revolutionary Guards are harboring Qaeda operatives, we would need to press hard diplomatically, economically and even be prepared to threaten military action. But a concerted effort to upend the regime could well backfire, ending the slow but nonetheless clear evolution of Iran into a genuine democracy.
Second and most important, the Bush administration should focus more on Al Qaeda, the only terrorist group that poses an imminent, undeterrable danger. New instability in Afghanistan and the continued spread of jihadist ideology in the Islamic world mean that the prospects for another 9/11 are growing. America has been fortunate in capturing some high-ranking terrorists, but we still lack a comprehensive program to deal with a growing global insurgency and the long-term threat of radical Islam, for which intelligence and law enforcement will not suffice.
Rogue regimes are bad for the world and worse for the people forced to live under them. Over time, we can use diplomacy -- including coercion -- and deterrence to bring about change. For now, however, the direst threat to Americans comes not from the mullahs of Tehran, but from the mass-murderers of Al Qaeda.

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
FIFTY years ago, the finest restaurant in New York was Le Pavillon, and diners knew precisely three things about it: It was French, it was expensive, and the owner was Henri Soule. It so happened that the restaurant employed some top-notch French chefs, notably Pierre Franey, who in turn hired a young fellow named Jacques Pepin. But in the 1950's, no one cared about chefs. They toiled anonymously below deck, like the stokers on a cruise line. The inner workings of Le Pavillon, for that matter, were of no more interest to the public than the goings-on at a pet shop or a tannery. 
 "The Restaurant," a six-episode reality series that begins tonight at 10 on NBC, accurately measures the distance that American diners have traveled in a couple of generations. It follows Rocco DiSpirito, a well-known New York chef, as he creates a new restaurant bearing his name in the Flatiron district of Manhattan. The project takes for granted that the average television viewer will find the very idea of a Manhattan restaurant fascinating and glamorous. It assumes an interest in the minutiae of food-service work, from the placement of forks on the table to the mechanics of running a kitchen. Finally, and quite accurately, it assumes that a restaurant has dramatic potential. Throw several dozen young people in close quarters, force them to work cooperatively at warp speed, and you get the full Shakespearean range of emotions: competitiveness, jealousy, anger, love and hate. 
 The show falls somewhere between a documentary and a stunt, and it's impossible to know when raw, uncensored reality encounters the shaping hand of the show's producers, a troika that includes Mark Burnett, the creator of "Survivor." Mr. DiSpirito, who made his reputation with Asian fusion cooking at Union Pacific, has a dream. He wants to open a restaurant devoted to the simple Italian food he grew up eating in Jamaica, Queens. I suspect that the dream took form just in time for "The Restaurant," but it's a nice dream.
Mr. DiSpirito's partner is Jeffrey Chodorow, the money man behind hot spots like China Grill, Hudson Cafeteria and Asia de Cuba. Their assignment is to find a location, create a restaurant, hire a staff and start serving customers in the space of seven weeks.
The absurd deadline lends tension to an already tense situation. Opening a restaurant in Manhattan requires enormous amounts of money (in this case, about $3 million). Satisfying the city's labyrinthine health and safety codes can make strong men weep. Rocco's, because it sits at the base of a residential building, must also please the building's owner, whose agent, a fussy, humorless man, cannot stand the idea that the tenants might catch a whiff of tomato sauce. To juice the drama, Mr. DiSpirito announces on radio appearances and on "The Today Show" that the restaurant will hold open casting sessions for cooks and waiters, an invitation that draws 2,000 prospects to East 22nd Street. Some have restaurant experience. Every one of them is dying to be on television.
Rocco's opens on schedule, but barely. Two hours before the opening, hammers are still pounding nails. Mr. DiSpirito, whose million-dollar smile and affable manner have made him a darling of the food press, sinks deep into depression as his vision threatens to become a nightmare. He begs Mr. Chodorow for another week. No dice.
"Rocco, you have a thousand reservations that week," Mr. Chodorow says. "Are you going to call a thousand people and tell them, 'Sorry, we were only kidding'?"
Mr. DiSpirito looks crushed, but he also knows the score. Delay means lost money. Losing money at the outset digs a big financial hole that can swallow a new restaurant. In one of the show's most revealing shots, taken just before Rocco's opens its doors, Mr. DiSpirito runs some cold water over his face in the bathroom and stares hard into the mirror. His face is a study in exhaustion, fear, determination and professional pride. The show, such as it is, must go on, even if it's with temporary tables and waiters who aren't sure whether they're serving zucchini or zucchini flowers.
It does. The diners arrive, orders are placed, and in a thrilling montage, viewers see a name-brand New York kitchen go into high gear. There's something undeniably impressive about the well-oiled team effort that sends out food for a hundred hungry, demanding customers. It's a little like the stirring naval sequences in "Ben-Hur," when the kettle drums begin to pound, the slaves pick up their oars, and the triremes accelerate to battle speed.
It all falls apart very quickly. The new team cannot keep up with the incoming orders. The inexperienced waiters spend too much time chatting with guests and not enough time serving them. The camera, panning the tables, catches faces frozen in annoyance, irritation and suppressed rage. And this is an invited audience of Mr. DiSpirito's friends and relatives. "They gave our entrees to another table?" a woman asks incredulously. The answer seems to be yes. 
Diners insult waiters. Waiters curse diners. Meanwhile, a fire has broken out in the kitchen, and a cloud of smoke spreadsover the dining room. As the evening winds down, another Manhattan restaurant called Rocco's serves a legal notice telling Mr. DiSpirito to stop using the name (it's changed to Rocco's on 22nd Street). Outside, the police begin towing illegally parked cars -- not just the patrons', but Mr. DiSpirito's, too.
Will Rocco, and Rocco's, recover from opening night? Will Mr. DiSpirito's wrath descend on the staff, many of them now prime candidates for firing? Will he ever get his Mitsubishi S.U.V. back from the police pound? The producers have called the series a nighttime soap opera, and it is a thoroughly gripping one, once you get past the turgid set-up.
The series goes down like a good dessert. Just how much sugar is in the recipe is another question. In real life, restaurant owners delay openings all the time, and I strongly suspect that Mr. DiSpirito would have gotten his extension if the rules of the series had not forced the issue. Qualified waiters are always in short supply, but in my dining life I've never seen quite the festival of ineptitude that Rocco's manages to stage. Nor have I seen waitresses clustering off to the side, gossiping and sneaking drinks of wine. That's what happens when you hire characters instead of workers. I am willing to bet big money that those cars would never have been towed in real life. Restaurants know what the parking regulations are on their streets, and they protect their customers. And that fire, when you think about it, breaks out at a convenient dramatic moment.
At the same time, there's nothing fake about Mr. DiSpirito's determination to create a good restaurant. Failure can make terrific television, but no chef wants to be seen on camera making bad food. It's one thing to thrill the audience with an unmitigated disaster. It's another to flambee your career in front of millions, and sink a restaurant that is intended to outlive the series. Rocco's on 22nd Street, in fact, carries on, with signs outside telling wary patrons that the cameras have gone.
"The Restaurant," despite its manipulations, opens a window that even professional food writers rarely get to look through. It makes clear, whether consciously or unconsciously, the unholy alliance of creativity, money and public relations that dominates New York's restaurant economy. Mr. DiSpirito spends as much time doing magazine photo shoots and huddling with his press agent as he does planning his menu. He and his backers know that his image makes him a bankable commodity. The cameras were rolling long before NBC came calling. That's the other big change since the days of Le Pavillon. In the old days, chefs just cooked. Today, they shoot for stardom, which can establish them as a brand, which can allow them to create restaurant empires. Viewers may think they're watching the painful birth of Rocco's on 22nd Street. The real story is Mr. DiSpirito's career.

 BODY:
IN the 1997 science-fiction movie "The Velocity Trap," the interstellar banking system is so decimated by electronic crime that the only way to exchange money is in cold hard cash. Armored federal banking ships have to shuttle currency from planet to planet.
 Carl Amos, an inventor in Atlanta, also anticipates a return to the cash economy but without the computer-generated visual effects. Mr. Amos recently patented a way to pay for online transactions with bills and coins rather than credit or banking cards. 
 "In upwards of three-quarters of the world, most money transactions are cash only," said Mr. Amos, who envisions a big market for his invention.
Basically, what Mr. Amos has patented is a new combination of existing technologies. 
His patent, No. 6,554,184, covers a modified A.T.M. that not only dispenses money but, like a vending machine, accepts cash, which can be used to transfer money from one person to another or to pay for online purchases.
"It's a method patent, a new way of doing business," Mr. Amos said. "These are off-the-shelf components. All I had to do was build the machine and write the software."
Mr. Amos is a rare breed: an independent inventor who actually makes a living off his inventions. A former electrical engineer at I.B.M., he left corporate life to develop his idea for a holographic lens. Since he patented the lens in 1994, he estimates, he has received about $1 million in royalties.
Mr. Amos, one of six children, grew up on a farm in Ohio, where he set up his own skunk works in a shed. Not all his inventions were successful. One was a parachute to be worn while leaping off the garage. "I survived, obviously," Mr. Amos said. "My siblings survived, too, thank goodness."
Mr. Amos said his latest invention, should it become widely available, would obviate the need for services provided by Western Union and other money-transfer companies. 
Another big market in the United States, Mr. Amos said, might be teenagers. Though they do not usually have their own credit cards, they usually have cash and are more than willing to spend it to download music or games.
Mr. Amos also said his system should appeal to those who were worried about identity theft on the Internet or who simply wanted the privacy it provided.
Gamblers may be interested in the technology. Many credit-card companies, for example, will not authorize payments to gambling sites. Nor will PayPal, the biggest third-party payment option on the Internet.
Tom Turano, a law partner specializing in banking patents at Testa Hurwitz & Thibeault in Boston, called the invention a "cute idea." 
"It's like a funky A.T.M.," Mr. Turano said. But the patent itself, he said, is "fairly narrow" and may be easy for others to come up with similar inventions that do not infringe the patent.
Mr. Amos, who is represented by a licensing firm in Connecticut, said he was approaching banks about licensing his patent. "Western Union and Moneygram haven't called me yet," Mr. Amos said. "But I don't expect them to."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Newspaper publishers remain cautious about claiming a recovery in advertising revenues.

BYLINE:  By Jacques Steinberg 

 BODY:
THE bargaining to secure commercials on the television networks for the coming season has resembled a Nascar race, with so many marketers striving to outmaneuver their competitors that they have propelled ad spending to record levels.
 By contrast, the advertising forecasts by the nation's big newspaper chains for the rest of the year have often been as cautious as a kiddie ride at an amusement park. 
 While many of the deals made in May for the fall TV season were 15 percent to 23 percent higher than those from spring 2002, the newspaper companies, by comparison, are nowhere near as bullish. Their temperance is consistent with what has not been an especially lucrative advertising year for publishers. The war in Iraq and the spread of the SARS virus had an impact on newspapers that rely significantly on travel advertising, including The New York Times and USA Today. And the high unemployment rate has driven down classified advertising at nearly every publication. 
In recent days, most of the big newspaper chains have reported only modest increases in advertising revenue for the second quarter over the comparable period a year earlier: 4.1 percent at the Gannett Company, which owns USA Today; 2.7 percent at the Tribune Company; 1.7 percent at The New York Times Company; and 0.9 percent at Knight Ridder Inc. At Dow Jones & Company, advertising revenue for the second quarter fell 12.2 percent from a year earlier.
Though the newspaper companies foresee some signs of encouragement in the second half of the year, including an unabating housing market and full-page ads for a number of big-budget movies, not one of them has been willing to give investors hope for especially high earnings growth by year end.
Why have most newspapers not seen evidence of the robust advertiser rebound that the television networks realized in the so-called upfront market?
One reason is that the clamoring for television time has come from big national advertisers, including soft-drink makers, restaurant chains and drug companies, while most newspapers depend on local retailers and employers for the bulk of their advertising. Those local businesses continue to be battered by the sputtering economy.
"Retail is very iffy going into the summer," said Douglas Arthur, a research analyst at Morgan Stanley who tracks newspaper companies. "Help-wanted has been a disaster."
And yet, many of the trends at particular companies are more difficult to generalize. The Times, for example, relies on some of the same national advertisers as the broadcast networks, but the newspaper has yet to bounce back as sharply in some categories. In many cases, the publishers are grappling with highly specific factors -- like where a newspaper is located or which advertisers it considers its bread and butter.
"There don't seem to be many universal truths," said John Kimball, senior vice president and chief marketing officer for the Newspaper Association of America, a trade group.
In a conference call with analysts on Thursday, for example, executives at the Tribune said that retail advertising growth in July was already "up in the mid-single digits," fueled in large part by The Chicago Tribune, which was said to be reaping the benefits of a new Bloomingdale's home store and the reopening of Marshall Fields's flagship on State Street.
But at Knight Ridder, retail advertising was up just 0.5 percent in June and 1.8 percent for the first six months, compared with the same periods a year earlier. Among the factors the company cited: the decision by the Safeway grocery chain to shift its advertising emphasis in northern California to direct mail (a setback for its San Jose Mercury News) and the closing of some Kmart and Winn-Dixie stores in North Texas (a setback for its Fort Worth Star-Telegram.)
And though help-wanted advertising, a critical source of revenue for most newspapers, remains down nearly everywhere, the magnitude varies by publication and region.
In San Jose, Calif., for example, where the retrenchment in Silicon Valley continues, help-wanted advertising at the Mercury News fell 45.7 percent in the second quarter, compared with the year-earlier period, after being down 54.7 percent in all of 2002, according to Morgan Stanley.
And yet, in Connecticut where the job market has had fewer fluctuations, The New Haven Register, a publication of the Journal Register Company, held losses in help-wanted advertising to less than 4 percent in June compared with the same month a year ago.
"That's pretty respectable," said Mr. Arthur, the Morgan Stanley analyst, adding, "considering how deep the valley has been."
One constant factor at newspaper companies across the industry is rising costs -- especially for newsprint.
Some newspaper companies have been spending as much as 15 percent more on newsprint than they were last fall, and some suppliers are threatening increases of an additional 10 percent in the coming months.
In their conference call with analysts last Tuesday, executives at the Times Company said they planned to respond to such developments by deferring some capital projects, as yet unspecified, and cutting operating expenses wherever possible. The company's chief financial officer, Leonard P. Forman, later said he was referring to some marketing and promotion costs, as well as expenses like photocopy paper.
Polk Laffoon, vice president for corporate relations of Knight Ridder, said that "to the extent the revenue environment remains challenging, we'll look extremely carefully at our cost structure." While one of the company's 31 daily newspapers, The Philadelphia Inquirer, took the step earlier this year of eliminating its century-old Sunday magazine, Mr. Laffoon said that other publications might respond to the economy by measures that include deferring the replacement of aging computers.
At McClatchy Newspapers Inc., which publishes The Sacramento Bee and 10 other daily newspapers and which last week reported an increase in advertising revenues of 3.5 percent for the first six months, there are no plans to freeze hiring. But, there is an attempt to keep nonlabor costs "as flat as possible," the company's chief executive, Gary B. Pruitt, said.
"We think we'll have growth," Mr. Pruitt said, "but it will be slow growth."

 CORRECTION:
The Advertising column in Business Day on Monday and a chart about second-quarter advertising sales for the nation's top newspaper companies omitted some sales for Dow Jones & Company and thus overstated the figures' overall decline. Including results for the Ottaway newspaper chain (but excluding the chain's divestitures or acquisitions over the last year), Dow Jones's newspaper advertising sales in the United States were $199.5 million in the second quarter, not $147.1 million. Sales for the first six months were $374.3 million, not $277 million.
Those figures translate into a second-quarter decline of 9.2 percent, not 12.2 percent, compared with sales in the period a year earlier. For the first six months, the drop was 9 percent, not 12.3 percent.

HEADLINE: On Brooklyn Back Lot, Finally, Some Action; 
After Years of Talk, a Movie Studio Is Being Built at the Navy Yard

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
A studio grows in Brooklyn.
 O.K., it doesn't exactly look like one. At the moment, Sound Stage 1 of the new Steiner Studios at the Brooklyn Navy Yard is hard-hat country. 
 But every day it's looking less and less like the weed-choked, rubble-strewn empty lot that cynics said it would forever be. Who could blame them? The highlight reel of plans for movie-studio projects in Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island could have been titled "Gone With the Wind." 
But hark, city cineastes. A 185-foot crane has been hoisting precast concrete sections to form the shell of a new moviemaking megastructure. Certainly the backdrop was appropriate for Hollywood East: the cinematic panorama of the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges and the Empire State Building loomed far across the river in the summer haze.
Lights, camera . . . action? Is the Navy Yard, at last, to become the legendarily elusive Hollywood on the Hudson?
Well, first off, the Navy Yard faces the East River. "And it's maybe more Burbank in Brooklyn," said Jay Fine, president and chief executive of Steiner Studios, citing California's busy television studio mecca. "Hollywood is to Burbank as Manhattan will be to Brooklyn." 
Close to four years after the low-profile Steiner Equities Group of Roseland, N.J., vanquished competing suitors Robert De Niro, Miramax Films and Vornado Realty Trust by locking up the Navy Yard studio rights, the $118 million project is toiling toward an opening in the fall of 2004. 
Lou Madigan, raised in Brooklyn, won the studio rights with a partner, Cary Hart, who has moved on to other opportunities. Mr. Madigan is now executive vice president of the studio, and to him, the visible construction "is the coolest thing to happen to Brooklyn since the Dodgers won the World Series at Ebbets Field." 
Maybe, but until a few weeks ago, when construction became visible above ground, Douglas C. Steiner, president of Steiner Equities Group, was decidedly anti-chicken-counting. "People have been cynical about this," he said. "We wanted to keep a low profile until the walls began going up." 
The 800-foot-by-180-foot building is to contain five soundstages in a one-floor studio, attached to a three-story office complex; next door, there is to be parking for 1,000 cars to accommodate television and movie workers. The studio is to have tech-forward production facilities, screening rooms, a fitness center and a commissary. Event space on the roof will be available for parties and promotional galas.
The Steiner Group has a ground lease on its site for 50 years, with a 20-year extension clause; the payout is estimated to be $100 million for the life of the lease. 
Mr. Steiner said the first building, 275,000 square feet, would include the largest soundstage in the Northeast, with 27,000 square feet of space, 1,000 square feet larger than Stage E at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens.
A second building, to be built several years from now if the first one is profitable, will have an even larger soundstage and four smaller ones.
Without fanfare, the city has already kicked in $28 million to upgrade waterlines, valves, sewers and electrical conduits because the infrastructure was allowed to deteriorate after major shipbuilding at the Navy Yard moved south in the era of President Lyndon B. Johnson. 
The Steiner Group, which is privately held, is paying $90 million for the first building. The company has developed more than 10 million square feet of property in 14 states and owns and manages about half of that. It is backing the studio, Mr. Steiner said, "to establish a beachhead in New York, and because we see it as a good investment." 
Despite studios' traditionally skimpy profit margins and high fixed costs, Mr. Steiner said he hoped to make a profit in three to five years. If he can make a go of it, the studio will be one New York answer to the sucking sound of runaway productions: those miscreants whose practice is to shoot exteriors in New York, then return to Los Angeles or jaunt off to Canada and farther-flung locales for interior and post-production studio work.
The Steiner Group is betting that film and television producers will find it cheaper to concentrate all their production in one facility, using not only interior soundstages, but also the streets of New York, in one grand film package. 
"We think we'll soak up pent-up demand very quickly," Mr. Fine said. "We can't compete with Toronto for the smaller million-dollar movies, but we believe that large productions, $35 million or more, would find our facility efficient and cost-effective."
He thinks Steiner Studios will have another advantage: "The talent that lives in New York likes to stay here, and they can influence where a film is made." 
To economic experts, film and television production is "a kind of light manufacturing," said Harold L. Vogel, of Vogel Capital Management. "It's relatively high-paying skilled work, and that would definitely help New York's economy. It could also help community businesses like caterers, so there would be a multiplier effect." 
Furthermore, Mr. Vogel said, in the city, "a substantial amount of existing capacity is being used, and it makes sense to consider putting up another studio." He referred to facilities like Kaufman Astoria Studios in Astoria and Silvercup Studios in Long Island City. 
Is the new studio's business plan based on stealing productions from Kaufman and Silvercup? "We didn't start the project thinking we would do that," Mr. Steiner said. "More space could build more business for all." 
But like so much in the entertainment business, the studio is a gamble. "The film business goes in cycles of demand, and it is not clear that they are getting in at the right part of the cycle," Mr. Vogel said of Steiner. "I don't see that the level of feature-film production is rising." 
Nevertheless, said Katherine Oliver, commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, "studios, networks and producers have told me that they would shoot more here if New York had more diversified space." 
The Navy Yard, a gated domain guarded by gray corrugated fences, razor wire and a riot of ginkgo trees, is bordered by Williamsburg, Fort Greene and Vinegar Hill. These days, the sprawling 265-acre campus is -- and will continue to be -- home to 200 small manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and crafts businesses, including the company that packages Sweet'N Low. 
The Navy Yard's bustle is, however, a far cry from its quondam glory, when more than 70,000 people worked there seven days a week. That was during World War II, which, in a way, began and ended at the yard: the battleship Arizona, sunk at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, was built there; so was the battleship Missouri, where Japan formally surrendered on Sept. 2, 1945. 
The Navy Yard was also the place where the battleship Maine was constructed (making possible the Spanish-American War), and during the Civil War it fitted the Monitor with its famous iron cladding. 
Eric J. Deutsch, president and chief executive of the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation, which manages the property, owned by New York City since the early 1970's, said the yard's 3.5 million square feet of roofed space was 98 percent occupied and brings in revenues of $17 million a year at rents of $6 to $16 per square foot. It attracts 3,500 workers every day. 
Three of the Navy Yard's six dry docks are still operational; the oldest, a granite-walled city landmark in perfect condition, where the Monitor once berthed, is currently being used to refit tugboats.
But land there is underused. For the development corporation, the building of the studio "is a dream come true," Mr. Deutsch said. "It's an opportunity for moviemakers to use our large, secure facility. We hope the studios will be an engine for development and will attract peripheral businesses such as set making and lighting supply." 
The Navy Yard is no stranger to movie crews. Directors have shot scenes there through the decades in films ranging from "On the Town," which opens and closes at the Navy Yard, to "Mickey Blue Eyes" and and "Donnie Brasco." 
Meanwhile, "there is a lot of land here," said Mr. Fine, a former CBS executive vice president once in charge of the network's East Coast production operations. Gesturing to the surrounding Navy Yard, he envisioned a crowded back lot with Hollywood-style exterior movie sets. "They could have built the exteriors for 'Gangs of New York' here, instead of in Italy," he said. 
Hey, the line forms right on the waterfront, you New York City movie dreamers. Who's ready to sign up for a Steiner Studios safari a la the Universal Studios Tour?

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: SECURITY; 
U.S. Is Creating An Iraqi Militia To Relieve G.I.'s

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 20 

 BODY:
The United States is creating a new Iraqi civil defense force within the next 45 days that is intended to free up thousands of American troops for antiguerrilla missions and to put an Iraqi face on the occupation's postwar security efforts, two top American generals said today.
 The immediate goal is to field about 7,000 American-trained militiamen to protect supply convoys and replace American troops now guarding power plants and ammunition depots. 
 The new Iraqi Governing Council has strongly supported creating an Iraqi militia, which appears to go well beyond a proposal under consideration at the Pentagon to hire private contractors to provide security at sites around the country.
"Over time, it'll free up an awful lot of American forces," said Gen. John P. Abizaid, who is making his first visit to Iraq as the new head of the United States Central Command. 
The persistent violence, two months after President Bush declared an end to major combat, was underscored today when two soldiers were killed and one was wounded in an ambush near Mosul in the north. Also today, an Iraqi driver for a United Nations agency died when his convoy was attacked near Baghdad.
In the southern city of Najaf, United States marines found themselves in a standoff with more than 10,000 mainly Shiite demonstrators, angered by rumors that American troops had harassed a cleric who had condemned the United States-led occupation. Page A6. 
Armed resistance to the American-led occupation is coming from a small number of "professional killers" drawn from "remnants of the old regime regrouping in squad-level attacks," said the United States administrator for Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III, on "Fox News Sunday."
The attacks pose "no strategic threat to us," Mr. Bremer said, in a guardedly upbeat assessment of conditions in Iraq. He cited as signs of progress the restoration of basic services, economic reforms and the recent establishment of the Governing Council, and he said it was "quite possible" that a constitutional conference, probably to open in September, could write a constitution that would lead to elections and a new government within a year.
Eventually, General Abizaid said, the Iraqi militia may also join American soldiers in joint raids against guerrilla fighters, who he said were waging increasingly sophisticated attacks against American troops.
The plan to establish an Iraqi civil defense force, first reported in The Washington Post, reflects the Pentagon's urgent priority to quell the mounting attacks against American troops and to use an interim Iraqi force to help do that until a larger Iraqi national army is formed in the coming months and years.
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, who is nearing the end of a five-day mission in Iraq, has heard repeatedly from tribal and civic leaders that the occupation authority must give Iraqis a greater role in governing and securing their country in order for the American-led effort to have credibility with the Iraqi public.
Today, Mr. Wolfowitz said that recruiting Iraqis for security and intelligence tasks was essential for the rebuilding of Iraq to succeed. Small numbers of Iraqis and Iraqi-Americans have already served as interpreters and scouts for American commandos and regular forces. "We need more of these people," Mr. Wolfowitz said. 
Establishing the militia as an interim Iraqi force is an acknowledgment that training and mobilizing an Iraqi national army will take years to accomplish. Bush administration officials in Washington and American commanders here say they cannot afford to wait that long.
Under the American plan, eight battalions with about 850 Iraqi militiamen each will train under and then work with army divisions in various regions around the country, said Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the commander of allied forces in Iraq. After 45 days, the second group of eight battalions, or nearly 7,000 more militiamen, could be recruited and trained, General Sanchez said.
The makeup of each unit would mirror the demographics of that particular region and would probably include both men and women. Previous military service would not be required but any officer who served in the Iraqi Army above the rank of lieutenant colonel would be barred. Local leaders would help identify militia recruits, who would receive basic training in human rights, weapons handling and patrol techniques.
"Probably the most important contribution they will bring will be putting an Iraqi face on the security problems of the country and ensuring that wherever our soldiers are, Iraqis are contributing to that security," General Sanchez said.
Many details still need to be worked out. General Sanchez and his boss, General Abizaid, focused on different aspects of the program.
General Sanchez said the forces would focus on basic duties like convoy protection, at least initially. "These are not forces intended to conduct offensive operations," General Sanchez told reporters during a lunch interview. "They will be on patrol with us. They will be on fixed sites."
Cautioning that he was not necessarily contradicting his subordinate, General Abizaid said the militia could eventually take on more challenging offensive missions but he did not say when that might happen.
"Over time, as confidence increases in working with these guys, we will ask them to do more and more complicated things," General Abizaid said at the lunch. "And it's important we do."
Some allied commanders have on their own already starting training Iraqi civil defense forces. The Army's 101st Airborne Division has trained one company of Iraqi militiamen in Mosul to guard an ammunition depot and is preparing to graduate three more companies. British forces in Basra, in the south, have organized a new Iraqi patrol force. General Abizaid said the American military needed to change its cultural mindset when it came to dealing with indigenous forces, adding that the United States needed to "train them and have them be prepared to conduct a full range of operations with us."
Recruiting for Iraq's new national army started recently, but American officials have said it will take a year to form an initial force of 12,000 soldiers and three years to create a 40,000-soldier force. The new militia could eventually be folded into the army, officials said.
"The important thing about the new Iraqi army is not the number of divisions or the type of equipment they have, but whether or not the officer corps respects the people they protect and serve the government," General Abizaid said.
Even as Mr. Wolfowitz has fielded Iraqi complaints for more security, he has telephoned his boss in Washington, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, at least twice in two days to try to agree on a workable militia plan, aides said.
The Pentagon is hoping that new Iraqi security forces and some 30,000 allied forces that will be arriving this summer will allow the United States to begin sending home many of the nearly 150,000 forces it has here now.
General Abizaid said the size and makeup of the American forces was likely to remain the same for the next few months, but he said he was planning to replace heavy armored forces that were needed in the war with lighter, more mobile troops that could patrol more efficiently in cities and respond quickly to fresh tips on the location of guerrilla fighters.
"A lot of people say if you just throw more troops at it, you're going to solve the problems," General Abizaid said. "But it's not a matter of boots per square meter. It's a matter of focused intelligence, and then troops that are agile enough to carry out missions in a manner that can cause surprise and take down the targets precisely."

Relearning The Wonders Of the City

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
OLD friends who moved recently to New York are reacquainting themselves with the city and talked about it the other night over dinner.
 They are lawyers and writers, and work kept them in Washington for many years, but life changed and they came home. Both had lived before in New York; he in fact is a Brooklyn native who, now 70-plus, had visited often. But you would think they were tourists seeing the city for the first time. They were downright giddy. 
 We share their giddiness because it was fun.
Consider their new block. In New York, a block can be a neighborhood. Theirs, not far from Gramercy Park, happens to include a strip joint. An upscale strip joint, if there is such a thing. But a strip joint it is.
In other words, a couple returning to New York after a long absence buys a luxury co-op and finds a strip club across the street. Mistake? Apartment-hunting again?
No way. They love it. Safest block in the city, they report. And the quietest. No loitering. "Everybody's a little ashamed, you know," the husband explained. He pulled his jacket over his head to mimic the street theater.
The strip joint is guarded by a large, bulky fellow called "Street," who, in famously anonymous New York, watches out for everyone on the block.
Street quickly got to know the newcomers. In fact, he knows them by their first names, admonished their college-age daughter for coming home late after a party, even chatted with her father about the political job he had years ago in Washington.
How Street knew all this is not clear. Maybe he recognized him? Or someone pointed him out? No matter, it's fine with the new (and former) New Yorker. "This guy's the essence of New York," he said of Street. "Wouldn't find him in Washington," which is surely true and surely just fine with Washington.
Let's admit it, the capital is easier and so much less frazzling than New York. Its subway stations look like museums, and the trains are clean. But they do not go very far. Ours do, to the delight of the prodigal couple. They take subways everywhere, from Harlem, where he has some business, to Midtown, where she works.
Which leads us to the matter of baby carriages. Baby carriages? "People lugging babies in carriages up and down the subway steps," the former Washington lawyer explained. "They just do it."
They have to, mainly in older, unrenovated stations without elevators (or with broken ones). Our friend said he realizes that but is still impressed with the coping mechanism of New Yorkers. "I saw some people struggling on the stairs with a stroller one day. I told them: 'You're heroes. You're all heroes.' " He drew curious stares, of course.
His wife is happy to be reminded of the breadth of New York. For instance, a quite-pregnant young woman she knows is getting married and asked for help finding a wedding dress of a certain configuration. Research on the Internet turned up the perfect shop. "It's right here in New York," said our friend. "Check it out."
We did. There is indeed a store, called Mom's Night Out, that specializes in maternity evening clothes, including wedding dresses. It is not the only one of its kind, but it's right on the Upper East Side and near the top of the list on Google. And near a subway.
THESE are the things New Yorkers take for granted, and since it's a tough, tough town, we have that right. Tragedy is never far away in New York. A subway fire. A dead child found wrapped in a plastic bag in the trash.
Frustration is always with us, too. Tax increases and the economy, the continuing impact of Sept. 11, the homeless, the unemployed, the loser judges. Unrelenting.
But there are not many places that can boast of a benign bouncer and a transportation system that attracts prominent lawyers and stroller-bearing parents -- people from different worlds.
It is, the Washington transplants recognized, the contrasts and the options that make New York New York. Not everyone needs a wedding dress designed for pregnancy. Nice to know the store that carries it is nearby, though.
Free Shakespeare in the Park is back, and sparkling Central Park is celebrating its 150th birthday. New Yorkers can join in. Or pay no attention, but know that it's here.
"Isn't it amazing that this city works?" Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas now living in New York, said to some friends this weekend. It really is. We forget. Nice to be reminded.

HEADLINE: Report Cites Factors Impeding Black Gains 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Black families' gains in income and education are being undermined by rising incarceration rates and a persistent unemployment gap compared with whites, the Urban League said in its latest report on the state of black America.
 Black families are "strong but challenged," said Marc Morial, president of the Urban League. 
 The annual report, scheduled for release on Wednesday, is a collection of nine essays written by experts on race, social justice, health, psychology and civil rights. 
Robert Hill, a senior researcher at the Rockville, Md., firm Westat, examines how the social and economic status of black families has changed.
Racism remains, he wrote. In the last 30 years, "there has been a strong shift from Jim Crow -- the overt manifestation of racial hatred by individuals and white society -- to James Crow, Esquire -- the maintenance of racial inequality through covert processes of structure and institutions," he wrote.
Though blacks are no more likely than whites to mistreat their children, they are overrepresented in the foster care system, Mr. Hill wrote. 
Teenage pregnancy contributes to the instability of black families; black teenagers are about three times more likely than whites to have babies out of wedlock, Mr. Hill said. Other factors that have hurt black families, he said, include drug use and AIDS.
Economically, a decline in manufacturing and the rise of service industries meant many black workers went from higher-paying blue-collar jobs to much lower-paying white-collar service jobs, he said.

HEADLINE: Bush Loyalists Compete for Spots on President's A-Team by Raising Record Money for 2004 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20 

 BODY:
As President Bush's re-election campaign races to accumulate the largest treasury in history, a similarly fierce contest has begun among his best-connected supporters. Raising $100,000 for the president is a bit passe in this competition; now loyalists must bring in $200,000 or more to be considered top-tier, and they had better come with sharp elbows and plenty of prosperous friends.
 "Everyone in town is trying to be a Pioneer or Ranger," said Jack Abramoff, a top Republican lobbyist here, using the campaign's terms for the most elite levels of money collectors. "But the only way to do it is to have contacts outside of D.C., which fortunately I do. So far I've raised about $120,000, and I haven't even really started making calls." 
 Competition, a bedrock principle of President Bush's economic philosophy, has proved enormously successful in building his record-setting campaign treasury. Of the $34.4 million raised through June by the Bush-Cheney campaign, a quarter has come in through just 68 fund-raisers who are jockeying with each other to bring in the most checks. Those fund-raisers, and scores of others who have signed pledge cards to join them, will become increasingly important as the campaign pushes toward its goal of banking at least $170 million and probably closer to $200 million. 
Industry moguls, lawyers and even governors are vying for the right to become Pioneers (those who have raised $100,000) or top-level Rangers ($200,000), the designation that shares the name of the baseball team once partly owned by Mr. Bush. When a fund-raiser gets a friend or business contact to write a check, the collector asks the donor to put the fund-raiser's tracking number in the corner, so the campaign will know who solicited the contribution.
Those who do so catch the eye of the White House, having demonstrated their loyalty to the administration in a way far more prominent than simply writing a check for the legal maximum of $2,000 per person.
"I had really wanted to be the first Ranger, but I didn't make it," said Carole L. Bionda, a Pioneer and the chairwoman-elect of Associated Builders and Contractors Inc., a large trade association. "But I still have a good shot at making it. It's fun, it's good for our organization, and it allows our members to express their support for the president."
Many of those on the list of top fund-raisers, released by the Bush campaign last week, were also Pioneers in the 2000 campaign, when that was the highest level attainable and the maximum contribution was $1,000. Some are newcomers to the campaign, while others are among the president's oldest friends and financial backers.
Almost all are successful business leaders: developers, lawyers or manufacturers who say they strongly agree with the president's economic and security policies. Four of those on the list own major-league sports franchises. Two are elected officials: Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Representative Thomas M. Reynolds of New York, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Others previously held office, including former Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida and Alfonse M. D'Amato, the former senator from New York.
Most of the fund-raisers said in interviews last week that they wanted to help ensure Mr. Bush's re-election and had no ulterior motive for collecting money for the president, although several said they were looking forward to the party for Rangers and Pioneers that the campaign has scheduled in Texas next month. A few, however, acknowledged that there were other benefits to being a "bundler," as the fund-raisers are known.
Ms. Bionda, for example, said her trade group has several issues, including changes to the laws regarding private health plans, to take to Washington, and said that her fund-raising could be useful. Mr. Reynolds said the president's re-election could also help Mr. Reynolds in his job of electing more Republicans to the House. Many other bundlers lead businesses whose fortunes can depend on the administration's tax or regulatory decisions.
The prominence and access that bundling can provide have long worried critics of big-money politics. Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a Washington group that advocates campaign finance reform, said the reliance on big fund-raisers can subvert the principle of contribution limits.
"When you have a formalized system like Pioneers and Rangers, the $200,000 fund-raiser becomes the equivalent of the $200,000 donor, and that's dangerous to the political system," Mr. Wertheimer said. "Chasing a huge amount of money, as the Bush campaign is doing, just increases the stake for fund-raisers who can bring in huge sums, and increases their clout and influence."
He advocates requiring all candidates to reveal their major fund-raisers, which they currently do not have to do. The Bush campaign voluntarily released its list of bundlers, which some Democratic candidates have not done.
"The president believes in as much transparency and disclosure as possible," said Nicolle Devenish, the Bush campaign's spokeswoman. "Those are his principles and values."
She said that bundlers had no option of remaining unlisted, and she rejected the idea that they had any enhanced clout with the administration. More than 80 percent of the 105,000 individual donations received so far, she said, were for $200 or less. Records filed with the Federal Election Commission show that about 85 percent of the money the campaign has collected so far came in donations of $1,000 or more.
It is not possible from public records to directly link fund-raisers to contributors, but some patterns are not hard to deduce, particularly when corporate executives solicit their employees or colleagues for donations. The Center for Responsive Politics compiled a list of the companies and firms whose employees gave the most to the Bush campaign. At six businesses the employees collectively gave more than $100,000, and each of the six had a top executive on the bundler list.
The six businesses included four financial companies -- Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and Credit Suisse First Boston -- and two law firms, Blank Rome in Philadelphia and Haynes & Boone in Dallas.
Many on the bundler list raised their money by sponsoring dinners or other events and taking credit for those who came and contributed, while others worked the telephones. Lawrence Bathgate II, a lawyer from Lakewood, N.J., who has ties to the Bush family, said he sent hundreds of handwritten letters to a network of friends and associates. Mr. Pataki sponsored a fund-raising dinner in New York in June and also made telephone calls, said his spokeswoman, Lisa Dewald Stoll.
Many of those contacted said it was much easier to raise money this year than in 2000 because Mr. Bush is now an incumbent broadly popular among Republicans and because the new campaign finance law doubled the individual contribution limit to $2,000. Bob Tuttle, a Beverly Hills car dealer whose father, Holmes Tuttle, was one of Ronald Reagan's earliest supporters, said most of the people he called gave the maximum amount. He said there have also been contributions from unexpected sources.
"I called one fellow I know, and his secretary said, 'Would you mind if I sent you a donation, too?' " said Mr. Tuttle, director of presidential personnel in the Reagan White House.
"I said, 'Mind? Of course not, send it in.' And she sent $25."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: IRAQI UNREST; 
In Shiite Holy City of Najaf, A Sudden Anti-U.S. Storm

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: NAJAF, Iraq, July 20 

 BODY:
The cleric and the lieutenant colonel stood just inches apart under the broiling noon sun today, white turban to camouflage helmet, trading invective about the deployment of American troops in this holy city.
 Behind the American officer, a line of about two dozen marines stood vigilant, their bayonets newly fixed to their rifles. Behind the cleric, a sweep of thousands of demonstrators, most of them trucked in from Baghdad, chanting slogans like "No Americans after today" and "No to America, no to colonialism, no to tyranny, no to the Devil!" 
 So lies the suddenly uneasy state of relations between the United States forces and the younger, more militant clergymen of Iraq's majority Shiite community. 
Until now, interactions between the Americans and the Iraqis in Najaf have been calm, free of the random violence rampant in the country's Sunni heartland. 
But a sudden storm erupted on Saturday after Moktada al-Sadr, the scion of a clan of beloved clerics and the most vocal supporter of Iranian-style theocracy in Iraq, asserted that American forces were encircling his home. They were bent on arresting him, his aides announced, after an incendiary sermon on Friday in which he rejected the American-appointed Governing Council and called for the formation of an Islamic army. 
It was, said Lt. Col. Christopher C. Conlin, the commanding officer here, a deliberate misunderstanding. 
There had indeed been Apache helicopters clattering overhead and extra troops on the streets, but that was to provide security for a visit by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, Colonel Conlin said.
The temporary ramping up of the United States presence could not be explained in advance for security reasons, and afterward the American officer relied on members of Najaf's City Council to pass the word. He wished the demonstrators would take their complaints to the new City Council. 
The abrupt storm this weekend underscored a point made by a review of the Iraq reconstruction effort released last week by a panel from the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The lack of Iraqis involved in the reconstruction at all levels, widespread unemployment and woefully inadequate means of communicating what is happening to the country's 24 million people have combined to fuel an ever-higher level of frustration and anger about the American presence. 
Men like Mr. Sadr and his followers, determined to harness that frustration to wrest a greater say in Iraq's future, are stepping into the void. 
"They used to think that they could marginalize the Shiites, that we would accept anything," said Sheik Khalid al-Khatami, an aide to Mr. Sadr, standing on a balcony beneath the gold dome of the tomb of Imam Ali, the founder of the Shiite sect, as the clerics whipped up the crowd. "That is a false impression. Neither the Americans nor any of the foreigners know how strong we are."
Najaf is the home to four respected ayatollahs, the senior Shiite leaders to whom the faithful look for guidance on virtually all aspects of daily life. The ayatollahs and their supporters were conspicuously absent from today's events, because they view Mr. Sadr and his followers as little more than young hotheads determined to make a name for themselves by stirring up violence against the occupation.
Mr. Sadr's father, Ayatollah Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr, was an outspoken defender of the Shiites before being gunned down in 1999 in a killing attributed to Saddam Hussein's henchman.
Out of respect for his father and not wanting to increase the younger cleric's allure, the ayatollahs and other Shiite political groups have mostly remained silent in public about the situation. 
"Moktada Sadr and his supporters are trying to drag us into this kind of confrontation, this kind of division between Shiites on the street," said a spokesman for the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, the most established Shiite group and a participant in the Governing Council.
But even the local Supreme Council office had apparently not gotten word that the American military movements on Saturday were not reacting to Mr. Sadr's Friday sermon. "The American policy should be calmer; they should not react so hastily to what he said," the spokesman added. 
He and others say that much of the new militancy in the Shiite community is being pushed by former Baathists, happy to find any channel they can to create unrest. 
Support for the demonstrators came from Iran, too. The protest opened with a message of support from Ayatollah Kathim al-Husseini al-Haeri, an Iraqi clergyman in the holy Iranian city of Qum. Members of the Governing Council were all American agents, he said in a message read aloud to the crowd, and the clerics were the legitimate rulers. 
Random comments on the street appeared to show little support for the demonstration on Saturday among the people in Najaf itself, and even two clergyman wandering through the shrine were wondering what all the fuss was about. 
"What do we need an Islamic army for?" said Riad Abu al-Awady, a 23-year-old Najaf resident. "Many members of my family fought in Saddam's wars and they are all dead. What Iraqis need is water, electricity, security, and we want to work."
Outside the headquarters of the United States forces here, on the old university campus, a young clergyman named Aws al-Khafaji, a member of Mr. Sadr's circle, made fiery speeches against the American military. He said the Americans were ruling through a "sissy" council, despoiling the holy city of Najaf with their presence, and spreading Western corruption. 
Then he and a few others walked forward a few times to confront Colonel Conlin, at one point handing over a list of demands -- including one that American forces leave the city immediately. 
"He is frustrated because this city is peaceful and he has a low support base here," the officer said about Mr. Sadr. "This is the city of ayatollahs, and this is just a young, inexperienced guy." 
But the young guy had deployed thousands of angry demonstrators on the Americans' doorstep. Colonel Conlin brought up a loudspeaker system of his own, addressing the crowd through an interpreter. His soldiers did not try to surround Mr. Sadr's house, he said, and they had no interest in arresting him. 
The colonel said the unruly demonstrators were blaspheming in the city of Abraham, and he warned that they must disband or be considered a threat to the American forces. 
Much of what the officer said was lost in the chanting of the crowd, and some of the translation was poor -- the Arabic version suggested that the crowd must show respect or be considered a threat.
But the clergymen, after reluctantly agreeing that both sides would air their viewpoint before the city's most prominent ayatollah, took their supporters home. There would, they said, be another demonstration on Monday.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Bush Takes a Brief Break From Relaxing to Rake In $7 Million

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., July 20 

 BODY:
President Bush never seems happier or more relaxed than when he is back here at his ranch. But this weekend, unwinding proved particularly profitable: He raised $7 million from Texas Republicans with minimal effort and was whisked back to his own living room by sunset -- exactly how the rest of his summer is shaping up.
 Mr. Bush spoke at two fund-raisers, one on Friday night in Dallas and another on Saturday evening in Houston, delivering a version of his new campaign speech at each stop. The speech is about 2,700 words long. So, if this weekend was representative, his campaign coffers swell by about $1,300 a word -- not bad for a weekend, especially one primarily devoted to tending to the ranch. 
 The new speech starts with an elephant joke: Mr. Bush says that, at a nature reserve in Botswana during his recent Africa trip, "I learned a lot about our party's mascot."
In Houston, he next told the crowd of about 700 that "you're laying the groundwork for what is going to be a great national victory in November of 2004." Then he praises his staff and refers to Vice President Dick Cheney, no slouch at fund-raising either in recent weeks, to set up his other laugh-line of the night.
"Our country has had no finer vice president than Dick Cheney," Mr. Bush said at both fund-raisers, and then, after waiting for the applause to die down, he added: "Mother may have a different thought." It is a reference, of course, to President Bush's father, who served as a far less influential vice president to Ronald Reagan than Mr. Cheney is to the current president.
But what is most interesting about Mr. Bush's new speech is the way that he puts the two brief wars of his presidency -- first in Afghanistan, then in Iraq -- to political use. Mr. Bush makes no references to the troubles American forces have encountered in each country. Instead, he portrays himself as a liberator.
"Fifty million people in those two countries once lived under tyranny," Mr. Bush said in Houston. "Today, they live in freedom."
He has a riff on the economy as well, one that describes himself as inheriting a mess, facing a war, combating corruption and taking decisive action. It is hardly the spin that Mr. Bush's political opponents might put on the same era.
"Two and a half years ago, we inherited an economy in recession," Mr. Bush said in Houston. "And then the attacks on our country, and scandals in corporate America, and war affected the people's confidence," he added, speaking in shorthand about the major headlines of the past 2 1/2 years. "But we acted. We passed tough new laws to hold corporate criminals to account. And to get the economy going again, we have twice led the United States Congress to pass historic tax relief for the American people."
There is no mention, not surprisingly, of the record deficits or the rising unemployment rate -- though clearly those issues are at the forefront of his political team's concerns as Mr. Bush prepares to travel this week to Philadelphia and Michigan to make the case for his economic policy. (It is a trip he will combine with more fund-raising.) 
Mr. Bush is expected to return here next weekend and stay until Labor Day, though leaving for more trips to press his economic agenda and raise money.
Mr. Bush did not dally in Houston on Saturday evening -- he flew straight back to the ranch. Around noon today, he led selected victims on his staff in a three-mile run in the 100-degree heat, with a medical team keeping pace. He then showed up late this afternoon to greet Italy's embattled prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, as he landed on the president's helicopter pad for an overnight visit.
Mr. Berlusconi was one of the few European supporters of the war in Iraq, and his visit here underscored the fact that France's president, Jacques Chirac, and Germany' chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, who opposed American efforts to build a broader coalition, are not likely to find themselves dining under the stars in Crawford anytime soon.
Mr. Bush could not resist tweaking the members of the news media as they stood in the blazing sun awaiting a glimpse of a Crawford tradition: the president, driving his white pickup truck with Texas plates, arriving to pick up his guests.
As he passed a collection of sweating American and Italian reporters, Mr. Bush, showing his compassionate conservative side, rolled down his window, waved, and said: "Let me turn down my air conditioner -- how y'all doing out there?"

HEADLINE: Race and Politics, a Familiar Pair, Seem to Be Back in Town 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
After years of ugly confrontations between City Hall and various minorities throughout the city, capped by a racially divisive 2001 mayoral primary, racial tensions in New York City seemed to have quieted over the last 18 months. A new mayor committed to soothing the racial storms and a City Council chock-full of new members, a large percentage of them blacks and Hispanics, have combined in part to make it so. 
 But a number of recent episodes suggest that race has re-entered the political conversation in New York, at least in discussions of sharing power. 
 Last week, members of the City Council accused Speaker Gifford Miller of supporting environmental racism by delaying action on a bill that would have tougher requirements for the removal of lead paint in city apartments. In that same week, members of the Democratic Party and others argued that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's attempt to remove party labels from municipal elections would hurt minority candidates. 
Two months ago, the teachers' union sued Chancellor Joel I. Klein, accusing him of racial discrimination because the Bloomberg administration's plan to lay off nearly 800 classroom aides disproportionately affected blacks and Hispanics. 
Further, Mr. Bloomberg's poll numbers among racial minorities are as low as some of the worst faced by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, in spite of the Bloomberg administration's efforts to reach out to minority communities.
Why this is happening is a matter of much debate among Democrats and Republicans alike, and a matter of concern on both the legislative and executives sides of City Hall. At the very least, said political experts and aides to elected officials, the city could be on the verge of another racially charged set of municipal elections, potentially unlike any the city has seen since David N. Dinkins was mayor.
"Race has been and will continue to be a very big issue in New York politics in a way that is probably not for the better of our civic life," said Howard Wolfson, a Democratic consultant who was executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2002.
While most political experts agree that racial disputes during political campaigns tend to harm minority candidates most, the question of race does not simply coalesce around tensions between whites and minorities, as it did in the 2001 primary. In that battle, Mark Green was criticized for an advertisement that questioned the competence of his opponent, Fernando Ferrer, who is Hispanic. 
Already, there is whispering in Democratic circles about which potential candidate, Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., who is black, or Mr. Ferrer has the best shot at forming a coalition of minority voters.
In an interview, Mr. Ferrer, who has yet to say whether he will run for office, said he believed his party had learned from the racial flare-up of the last campaign. "I think it is axiomatic in a diverse constituency" to keep racial disputes from arising in an election, he said. 
"You want to try and bring people together as much as you can," he said. "That is a lesson that has been learned by the Republican Party. That was what Bloomberg and Pataki learning Spanish was about," said Mr. Ferrer. He was present at the news conference in which Mr. Miller's delay on the lead paint bill was denounced by Councilwoman Helen D. Foster as environmental racism, though he later denounced the rhetoric. 
Numerous people involved in New York City politics for years argue that race never loses its currency in this city, but awaits a policy issue or a political campaign to bring it out in the open. 
"Race always ripples right under the skin of the body politic," said Norman Adler, a political consultant. "If it finds an opening, it pops up. And sometimes it is a convenient rhetorical tool." For instance, on the issue of lead paint, "the people who are for a tougher law tried other internal means in the Council," Mr. Adler said, "and couldn't move it. So race seemed a way to organize around the issue."
Once the race card is played, it is difficult to put it back in the deck. Mr. Bloomberg is still seething, his aides say, over the lawsuit filed by Randi Weingarten, head of the teachers' union, charging racism in the plan to lay off paraprofessionals from the Department of Education. Ms. Weingarten says now that while she thought the suit had merits, she regrets her role in characterizing the mayor's intentions. 
"I think I should have made it very clear when we filed it that this was not a case where I was questioning the mayor's intent or Joel Klein's intent," Ms. Weingarten said, "and that the lawsuit questioned the effect of the choice. The effect of laying off all these paraprofessionals was that it hurt minorities more than nonminorities. But I should have been much clearer that I was talking about disparate impact instead of intentionality." 
In many ways, while racial tensions have certainly not gone away in the last two years, they have seemed dormant. Many political experts, elected officials and others credit Mayor Bloomberg in part for this. 
They point to the mayor's efforts to reach out to minority politicians who were not welcome in City Hall for many years, and note that he has visited roughly 20 black churches since he was elected, a large number for a mayor whose political ventures outside Manhattan have been limited until recently. Many credit him with moving swiftly to discipline police officials connected to the death of a black civil servant during a police raid. 
It is also true -- and this is not good news for Mr. Bloomberg -- that race has been replaced or at least enveloped by class as the central tenet of voter discontent in the city. And that class-centered discontent is expressed by racial minorities, who tend to dominate low-income groups, and by those white voters who have lost their jobs, watched their taxes rise and suffered higher fees, all while Mr. Bloomberg has been in office. 
While there have been no significant protests around a racial issue since he took office, there have been plenty related to the budget, and the signs have been carried by people of all races.
"The 2005 race will be about the economy," said Roberto Ramirez, a Bronx Democratic leader. "The hike in property taxes, the sense in the city that there is not enough affordable housing, and the feeling that the city needs a mayor who recognizes what the average New Yorker faces every day."
In that sense, several political experts said, any Democrat who wants a clear shot at City Hall would be better served by forming coalitions along class lines, or among various groups of people who are angry at the current mayor, rather than by trying to form a coalition based on racial and ethnic groupings.
"I think that a Democratic strategy for victory in the mayoral race has to involve uniting African-Americans and Latinos with whites in the outer boroughs who are unhappy with Bloomberg and who are upset about taxes and other issues," Mr. Wolfson said. "That is the coalition for victory, and racial polarization hurts that goal." 
Hank Sheinkopf, who is advising Mr. Thompson, said he also believed that the economy, rather than identity politics, would drive the next mayoral election. "There is a legitimacy of a racial coalition," he said, adding, "There are less ethnic politics and more borough politics right now. People in New York City tend to vote for people who are a lot like them, but they also want people of substance."

Quest for Infinite Youth Raises Hopes and Cash

BYLINE:  By ROBERT H. BINSTOCK; Robert H. Binstock, professor of aging, health and society at Case Western Reserve University, is co-editor of the forthcoming book "The Fountain of Youth: Cultural, Scientific, and Ethical Perspectives on a Biomedical Goal."

 BODY:
MERCHANTS OF IMMORTALITY
Chasing the Dream of Human Life Extension
By Stephen S. Hall
439 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $25.
 A year ago an international group of biologists who conduct research on the processes of aging published a consensus statement in Scientific American proclaiming that there is "no truth to the fountain of youth." They did so in order to distinguish themselves from charlatans and quacks who purvey anti-aging products and treatments that are ineffective and sometimes harmful. Yet many legitimate scientists, including some who signed the consensus statement, are striving to develop biotechnologies that will slow or arrest aging and restore and rejuvenate damaged and aging body components. 
 In "Merchants of Immortality" the journalist Stephen S. Hall provides a fascinating, accurate and accessible account of some of these contemporary efforts to combat aging. He concentrates on two arenas of research and development, cell replication and stem cell therapy, and on the commercial and political forces that shape them. Of course neither arena literally involves the goal of achieving immortality.
Mr. Hall begins with the biologist Leonard Hayflick's important discovery that human cells replicate only a finite number of times. Subsequent research by others focused on telomerase, an enzyme that might possibly be used to enable cells to replicate well beyond what had become known as the Hayflick Limit.
This vision motivated Michael West, a biologist, entrepreneur and publicist extraordinaire, to raise venture capital to exploit telomerase's commercial potential. In 1992, appropriating the Greek word for old man, he established Geron, the first biotechnology company explicitly devoted to the molecular biology of aging. Mr. West's dream was to clone telomerase, the "immortalizing enzyme," for potential application in substantially extending cell life and maybe the lives of humans.
Eventually Geron scientists were able to insert the telomerase gene into laboratory cultures of human cells, which then replicated dozens (and eventually hundreds) of times beyond the Hayflick Limit. The stock market responded enthusiastically in the short run by bidding up shares of Geron. But as Mr. Hall points out, extending the lives of cells is a long way from extending the life span of humans.
Disappointingly he leaves the cell replication story here without providing much of an assessment of where the promises and limitations of applying telomerase lie today. Instead he turns to a second story, the science, economics and politics of efforts to develop stem cells for therapeutic purposes. The connective tissue between the two tales is Michael West. By the late 1990's he was eased out of Geron and became the chief executive of Advanced Cell Technology, a company that was attempting to clone embryonic stem cells.
Scientists are not focused on these cells as a potential means of slowing or arresting the basic biological processes of aging but rather because of their tremendous potential for extending years of healthy and vigorous life by treating a wide variety of diseases and regenerating damaged parts of the body. As Mr. Hall notes, they are "pluripotent." Yet the therapeutic payoff from embryonic stem cells will not be achieved without a great deal of further research and development. 
Because of this Mr. Hall weighs in heavily to document and deplore the strong opposition to using embryonic tissue, mobilized by anti-abortion advocates and conservative politicians who share and support their views, as well as by bioethicists who warn that unchecked biotechnology will ultimately destroy the "natural" human virtues.
President Bush's announcement in 2001 of a compromise policy was a critical event in the national controversy over whether the federal government should finance research based on embryonic stem cell cloning. It limited federal research support to those cell lines that existed at the time of his speech. The president claimed that there were more than 60 of them in existence, and that they would be sufficient. Mr. Hall harshly criticizes this claim because, as it turned out, "the number of usable and available stem cell lines is no more than three or four," a woefully inadequate number to enable much research progress.
The consequence, Mr. Hall laments, is that harnessing the enormous potential of embryonic stem cells to alleviate disease and misery is for now a task that has been relegated "to a handful of underfinanced, understaffed and scientifically overwhelmed boutique biotech companies." He concludes, "Constricting our biomedical opportunities in the face of speculative and often ideologically inspired fears is timid, reactive and bad public policy."
Meanwhile efforts to slow and combat aging are proceeding on many other fronts. For instance it is well established that restriction of caloric intake in experimental animals substantially increases their life span and slows aging-associated changes. Respected scientists are trying to develop for humans a pill that mimics the biochemical effects of caloric restriction while still allowing normal food consumption. One of them estimates that success in this undertaking would produce 90-year-olds as vigorous as today's 50-year-olds and increase both average life expectancy and maximum life span by 40 percent. 
The implications of widespread access to such an intervention are profound. Virtually every social institution would be radically transformed.
Scientists and entrepreneurs will persist in their efforts to combat aging as well as disease, with and without government support. It is time for widespread, sustained and farsighted public dialogue about the implications of finding the fountain of youth, so we can take a hand in shaping our collective future. Mr. Hall's compelling book is an excellent launching pad.

HEADLINE: Children Are Getting Fatter, U.S. Finds 

BYLINE:  By ERIC NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
An annual government report that assesses the well-being of American children is warning for the first time that excess weight in childhood poses a major public health problem.
 The report, released last week by the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, chronicles major changes in weight patterns. From 1976 to 1980, it said, 6 percent of children ages 6 to 18 were overweight. From 1999 to 2000, 15 percent were. 
 "The thing that's kind of alarming here is the amount of change in a relatively short time," Dr. Duane Alexander, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development director, said in an interview. Government officials cited lack of exercise and poor diet as likely causes of the problem.
Although the broad-ranging report has been issued for seven years, this is the first time that it included statistics about weight. Until now, officials said, annual data were insufficient to assess the issue. The report also draws on a wide swath of health, education, housing and other statistics.
In general, the report gave an upbeat assessment about the well-being of American children. Infant mortality, for example, continued to decrease from its high of 10.9 deaths per thousand births in 1993, although the percentage of babies with low birth weights increased slightly, to 7.7. In 2000, the infant mortality rate was 6.9 deaths per 1,000 births. Deaths in childhood, from causes like car crashes and violent crime, also declined.
Births among adolescents also continued to go down, with the greatest reduction among black teenagers. The birthrate among 15- to 17-year-olds in 2001 was 25 per 1,000, the lowest ever recorded, the report said.
Smoking among teenagers also declined to the lowest levels since officials began collecting data in 1975. Among eighth graders, 5 percent reported smoking daily. The figures were 10 percent for 10th graders and 17 percent for 12th graders.
Dr. Alexander said the findings contradicted a widespread perception that children in the United States were doing worse.
Some critics, however, including the Children's Defense Fund, described the report as too upbeat. Toby Chaudhuri, a spokesman for the group, argued that the government was losing sight of the big picture.
And even Dr. Alexander acknowledged that the data in the report did not reflect the economic downturn of the last few years. "Whether these improvements that we're seeing will hold in harder economic times, people are worried, frankly," he said.

Disturbing Lessons of Girth

BYLINE:  By John Langone

 BODY:
"Menu for Life: African Americans Get Healthy, Eat Well, Lose Weight and Live Beautifully," by Dr. Otelio S. Randall and Donna Randall. 
Broadway Books, $22.95.
 The statistics that fill this book are not cheery, especially as they relate to African-Americans. For example, the authors reveal that the average black woman today wears a size 2X, one that didn't exist 30 years ago and that corresponds to a 38-inch waistline. 
 On the other hand, the average American woman wears a size 16 and has a 34-inch waist.
There's more here to disturb the weight-conscious. Sixty-six percent of black women are overweight, and 1 in 10 is "morbidly obese," more than 100 pounds overweight. (African-American men don't fare well either. Six in 10 are overweight, and 2 of those 6 are obese.)
"African-Americans, especially women, have come to accept heavier bodies," suggest the authors, a married couple, one a cardiologist, the other a nutrition expert. "Each time the cycle swings back to putting on a few more pounds, we tell ourselves this is not so bad, that it is healthy and right to love our substantial bodies."
The Randalls outline myriad health problems that bedevil overweight African-Americans, explore the variety of historic and economic reasons behind unhealthy eating and offer a well-ordered program of exercise, recipes and tips on ways to avoid "emotional eating." 
"We work to increase our share in the American abundance," they write. "Sometimes, yes, bigger is better. Living big can be something grand and beautiful."
But, they add, the price is high.

HEADLINE: A Desperate Global Scavenger Hunt to Keep AIDS Patients Alive 

BYLINE:  By SHARON LERNER

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR 

 BODY:
Every three months or so, a package from the United States arrives at the small clinic that Dr. Mary Annel operates behind an unmarked door in a run-down neighborhood here.
 The package contains drugs to treat those with H.I.V. But the medications do not come from an official aid program or a pharmaceutical company. Instead, they are leftover drugs, prescribed for American patients, that have been collected and shipped by their doctors, whom Dr. Annel has drawn into a stopgap network that keeps at least some of her patients alive. 
 In El Salvador, the government provides antiretroviral drugs to only a small fraction of the people who need them. As in most of the developing world, a vast majority of people with H.I.V. go untreated. 
Most of Dr. Annel's patients can barely afford to travel to her clinic, let alone pay for the drugs that can cost up to $6,000 a year here.
It is illegal to redistribute these medications within the United States after they have been prescribed. But there are no laws prohibiting their use in El Salvador. Dr. Annel, who is also a nun, has amassed enough medicine to supply 26 of her 130 H.I.V.-positive patients. "As soon as I have six months' worth, I start another patient," she said.
While President Bush used his recent trip to Africa to focus attention on a global initiative that promises $15 billion to fight AIDS, people in poor countries are desperately scavenging for drugs that can suppress the virus.
An estimated 5 percent of people in developing nations who need effective AIDS medications are able to get them, the World Health Organization reports. Even fewer are gaining access to antiretroviral therapy through creative routes forged in desperation.
Though the precise number is impossible to know, thousands of people who would otherwise go without the AIDS drugs now get them from programs that recycle them, from informal networks of doctors who donate them, by traveling across borders to buy relatively low-cost generic copies and on the black market.
Aid for AIDS in Manhattan -- a nonprofit group with branches in Italy, Spain and Switzerland -- collects secondhand drugs after people with H.I.V. switch prescriptions, take a break from medications or die.
Expanding on the informal hand-me-down approach employed by Dr. Annel and other doctors, the group passes these antiretrovirals to more than 500 people with H.I.V. throughout Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America.
Others cross borders to take advantage of discrepancies in drug prices among different countries. A year's worth of antiretroviral drugs now costs $2,000 to $2,200 in South Africa, for instance, while the same regimen can be bought for a mere $300 in neighboring Lesotho and Namibia, where the governments permit the sale of generic copies of the drugs.
"Many people go to these countries to buy drugs at the wholesale distributor," said Marta Darder, coordinator of a campaign to provide access to essential medicines for Doctors Without Borders in Cape Town.
"People don't have anything to lose, so if they have a bit of money, they'll run into the pharmacy and buy what they can afford," Ms. Darder said. "Or they'll receive a box of medicines from a relative and take them for a month or two."
While Doctors Without Borders has authorization from the South African government to use generic medicines bought elsewhere, other groups distribute lower-cost medicine illegally and without oversight.
As a result, a thriving black market has grown around AIDS medicines. Health care workers report illegal sales of antiretroviral drugs left over from clinical trials in the United States, for instance.
"Because patients couldn't afford the other drugs, they've bought these at a cheaper price," Cissy Kityo, a health official in Kampala, Uganda, said in a telephone interview.
Medicine from these sources can keep hopes alive. But health experts are concerned that substandard drug quality and inadequate oversight and education of patients will create serious public health problems.
"The worry is that patients who take these drugs are not being monitored," Dr. Kityo said. "Sometimes they're taking very funny combinations."
More than 17 antiretroviral drugs are now available; therapy usually requires 3 of them. Inappropriate drug combinations or inadequate doses can result in side effects, drug resistance and unfortunate interactions between medications. Of particular concern is the spread of drug resistance, highlighted by a report last week that almost 10 percent of new H.I.V. patients in Europe had drug-resistant strains.
In poor countries, people with AIDS are often forced to choose between bad treatment and no treatment. "And if bad treatment can prolong your life just a few months, to that individual it's worth it," said Daniel Berman, coordinator of Doctors Without Borders' Access to Medicines Campaign in Geneva.
Doctors face related quandaries. Though taking two antiretroviral drugs can breed drug-resistance in the virus and is less effective than a three-drug combination in suppressing the virus, some prescribe this regimen if their patients cannot afford a third drug. Other physicians, like Dr. Annel in El Salvador, struggle with the ethical burden of distributing an inadequate supply of drugs among many needy patients.
Henry Chang, executive director of A.H.F. Global Immunity, a branch of AIDS Healthcare Foundation -- which operates clinics in Honduras, South Africa, Uganda and Ukraine -- questioned the wisdom of using drugs that may not be consistently available.
"This treatment should be lifelong," Dr. Chang said. "I'm not sure that groups donating medications have spent a lot of energy on that side of the equation. If they don't distribute drugs carefully and do it well, they could be doing more harm than good."
In the meantime, Mr. Chang's group is working to minimize drug resistance in poor countries by educating patients and health care workers about the importance of taking medicines consistently and only in prescribed combinations.
The World Health Organization has recently set up a coalition to make antiretrovirals affordable and available and to track resistance.
For their part, the international groups distributing medicines to people with AIDS in poor countries insist that any risk involved with their programs is worth taking.
"There's no guarantee that we can keep the people we serve in treatment, but the alternative is far worse," said Amar Sall, executive director of AIDS Empowerment and Treatment International, a Washington-based group that buys generic drugs in India and distributes them to people with H.I.V. in Africa and the Caribbean. "If we don't give people anything, we know they'll die."
That possibility is never far from the thoughts of Dr. Francoise Ndayishimiye. A physician in Bujumbura, Burundi, Dr. Ndayishimiye has worked with AIDS Empowerment and Treatment International to supply 18 people in Burundi with antiretroviral therapy.
"I am so grateful for the drugs," Dr. Ndayishimiye said. "But there are so many other people in need." Her mother and two cousins have AIDS, but they have been unable to get the medications, she said. Many of her patients with H.I.V., now exceeding two dozen, could benefit from antiretroviral therapy but they are unable to secure it.
And though she is not sick enough yet, Dr. Ndayishimiye said she was also infected with the virus and expected to need the drugs eventually.
Having seen more than 30 friends and relatives die of AIDS, Dr. Ndayishimiye struggles to find the right words when speaking to people unable to get the drugs they need. "We don't have so much to say to them," Dr. Ndayishimiye said. "We tell them just to hope that maybe in the coming days the drugs will be cheaper and that eventually they will get them."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: IRAQ'S ECONOMY; 
New Trade Bank to Extend Credit for Rebuilding

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 21 

 BODY:
The United States-led occupation forces in Iraq announced a new program tonight that would allow Iraqi ministries easier access to credit to buy imported food, commodities, materials and other necessities for reconstruction.
 With Iraq's shattered economy and weakened financial institutions, many foreign companies have been reluctant to sell goods on credit either to the ministries that control public services and most large industries or to independent businesses. 
 The newly established Trade Bank of Iraq will use funds, set aside in accounts held by allied forces and earmarked for reconstruction, to guarantee that the sellers will be paid. According to a decree issued by L. Paul Bremer III, the top civilian administrator in Iraq, the new trade bank will be liable for up to $100 million worth of credit guarantees. Mr. Bremer is head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the American-led alliance rebuilding Iraq. 
The money backing the bank will come from the $1.2 billion Development Fund for Iraq, said Peter McPherson, a top economic adviser to Mr. Bremer. The development fund is money already being used to help finance the $2.2 billion budget deficit projected for the second half of this year. The trade bank will initially be capitalized with up to $5 million from the development fund. If it is unable to meet its obligations with available cash, the trade bank will be able to consume up to $95 million more from the development fund.
The trade bank, an independent Iraqi governmental agency, will back up guarantees issued by a consortium of banks and financial institutions to sellers of goods and services to Iraqi ministries and businesses. The ministries, remnants of the old government, are now overseen by occupation officials.
In an interview tonight, Mr. McPherson said it was possible that up to $100 million in transactions each month could be made using the trade bank. Private companies could also use the new guarantees, but the businesses would have to post some form of collateral or margin to cover the purchases, he said. 
The new bank will speed the acquisition of materials needed for rebuilding Iraq, including power generators, sewage pipes and oil field equipment.
"The first step that a country in deep distress usually takes to get out of such distress is trade credit," he said.
But the finances of the reconstruction effort remain uncertain, and officials are still grappling with how to find the billions of dollars for the huge projects that are needed just to get Iraq to where it has even marginally acceptable systems for sewage, electricity generation and distribution, and other public services.
As of July 1, the occupation had $5.4 billion available to pay for reconstruction. But that is expected to dwindle to $1.1 billion by the end of the year as the allies burn through cash used to finance the budget deficit and to help the Iraqi Central Bank support its currency. 
Ending the year with $1.1 billion may itself be an optimistic projection, as it depends on Iraq's generating net oil revenues of almost $3.5 billion in the second half of the year. Some oil analysts say that level of revenue may not be possible because of the looting and sabotage that have undermined Iraq's already dilapidated oil-producing infrastructure.
American officials hope a donor conference later this year will raise billions of dollars from other countries to finance specific projects, allowing the coalition to use its limited cash for other purposes.
Companies involved in rebuilding Iraq, including Halliburton and Bechtel, are also pushing a plan to pledge future Iraqi oil and gas revenue to help raise billions for reconstruction. The fate of that plan remains uncertain. It has drawn both supporters and critics within the Bush administration as well as within the new 25-member Iraqi Governing Council, the country's first postwar government.

HEADLINE: Economic Indicators Rise For 3rd Month 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
An index of future economic activity was higher in June for the third consecutive month, a private research group reported yesterday.
 The group, the Conference Board, said its index of leading economic indicators edged up 0.1 percent, reflecting stronger stock prices, an increase in the money supply and more permits for home construction. 
The increase matched economists' forecasts. 
 The index, a broad measure of how the economy is likely to perform in the next three to six months, had risen 1.1 percent in May and 0.1 percent in April. The consecutive increases, though mostly modest ones, mark the longest unbroken gains since January 2002. 
Economists said that the 13 interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve since the start of 2001 and billions of dollars in tax cuts might provide more strength for the economy in the months ahead. Maria Forres of Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson in Chicago, predicted, "The lower tax rates and interest rates will fuel business investment in the second half." 
Four of the 10 indicators that the Conference Board uses to derive the index of leading economic indicators contributed to the rise. A decline in initial jobless claims also buoyed the index.
Measures of the average workweek and new orders for business equipment had no effect on the June results. Factors restraining the index included a drop in consumer goods orders, lower consumer confidence and a narrowing of the spread between the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note and the federal funds rate.
The Conference Board's index of coincident indicators, a gauge of current economic activity, increased 0.1 percent in June for a second month. That index tracks payrolls, incomes, sales and production.
The index of lagging indicators fell 0.5 percent last month, compared with a 0.1 percent decrease in May.

HEADLINE: Shifting Its Focus, Kodak Buys Dental Technology Company 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The Eastman Kodak Company, struggling to reinvent itself as digital technology eats into its once-stellar photographic film businesses, said yesterday that it would buy PracticeWorks, a company that sells information technology systems for dental offices, for about $500 million in cash.
 Analysts said the size of the deal was a clear sign that Kodak had finally accepted that health care-related businesses would be the engine of its future growth, supplanting consumer photography, for decades the bedrock of its profits and its image. 
 "Health imaging is probably the one end-market in which Kodak can have nice long-term growth," said David R. Giroux, an investment analyst for T. Rowe Price, which owns Kodak shares.
The analyst gets no argument from Daniel A. Carp, Kodak's chairman. "We are turning from a consumer film company to a balanced company, and we have consistently identified health imaging as an attractive opportunity," Mr. Carp said in an interview. 
Lately, it is one of the few opportunities for the company. The sluggish economy and the migration of photographers toward digital cameras have whittled away at Kodak's sales. Conventional wisdom among analysts is that this year, for the first time, sales of digital cameras will exceed sales of film-based cameras -- a trend that no one, least of all Kodak, expects to see reversed. 
In contrast, societal trends within the United States and around the world bode well for businesses related to delivering health care.
Kodak took its first plunge into the field in 1998 when it bought Imation's medical imaging business, which gave it the technology to capture X-rays digitally and print them without chemicals. Since then, health imaging has provided an increasing share of Kodak's sales and profits, accounting for $2.3 billion of Kodak's total $12.8 billion in revenue last year. 
"Film sales may come back when the economy comes back, but health imaging will still be their biggest growth area," said Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Buckman, Buckman & Reid. "The PracticeWorks deal is an immediate injection of growth." 
Indeed, even within health imaging, dental offices are a relatively untapped market. Kodak has been an important provider of X-ray film for dental offices for decades, but it has marketed its digital information and archiving services primarily to medical doctors and hospitals, not dentists. Kodak estimates that the annual market for dental imaging systems is about $600 million.
With PracticeWorks, which itself recently bought a French dental imaging company, Trophy Radiologie, Kodak gains the ability to offer dentists a start-to-finish computer system that they can use to schedule patient visits, take digital X-rays, and append them -- either as printouts or electronic files -- to both a patient's charts and to insurance claims. And it lets Kodak learn how dental offices work.
"We'll be in the sweet spot of millions of transactions every day, and we can develop the skills to provide management services as well as tools in the future," said Dan Kerpelman, who Kodak recruited last year from G.E. Medical Systems to head its health imaging business.
Though the deal seemed to take analysts by surprise, Mr. Kerpelman said in an interview that it was long in the making. Kodak had put out feelers to PracticeWorks and Trophy before they merged in December. Since then, he said, Kodak got to know executives at both companies, a fact Mr. Kerpelman said should ease the integration process. 
"We did lots of due diligence, we've test-driven the relationships with the people, and we know that this is a tight strategic fit," he said. The deal probably will not close until the end of the year, Mr. Kerpelman said, but an acquisition integration team is already up and running. 
The price was high. Kodak will pay the equivalent of $21.50 a share for PracticeWorks common stock and $7.33 a share for preferred shares, and will assume $34 million in debt. Kodak expects PracticeWorks to add $215 million to revenue in the first year after the deal closes. But Mr. Kerpelman conceded that the deal would probably dilute earnings slightly for the next couple of years. 
PracticeWorks will keep its headquarters in Atlanta, while Trophy will remain based in Paris, and Kodak anticipates few job cuts. "The synergies are in the growth side, so we have no need to slash and burn," Mr. Kerpelman said. 
Although Kodak says it has plenty of cash to pay for the acquisition, analysts worry about the opportunity cost. After a hastily arranged conference call yesterday to discuss the deal, several analysts expressed concern that Kodak would begin paying down its debts more slowly, and may even reduce its dividend. (On that subject, Mr. Carp would say only that Kodak's dividend policy would be reviewed as usual at a board meeting in September.)
Investors clearly think PracticeWorks shareholders got the better deal. Shares of PracticeWorks, which have been climbing since the fall, gained another $3.53 yesterday to close at $21.21, up 20 percent. Kodak shares, which have been sliding for a month, closed at $25.40, down 90 cents or 3.4 percent. 
"The deal is right strategically," Mr. Giroux of T. Rowe Price said, "but the price is still very aggressive for what they are getting."

HEADLINE: House Leaders Delay AmeriCorps Action 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21 

 BODY:
Facing a majority of House members in favor of emergency spending for AmeriCorps, House Republican leaders who oppose the increase for the program decided today to put off a floor confrontation. 
 Supporters said they believed that a cash infusion would arrive soon, after a compromise with the Senate. 
 AmeriCorps, the national service program, is facing a cash crisis, and it has warned of drastic cuts to popular initiatives like Teach for America, City Year and Save the Children if Congress does not appropriate $100 million in a few weeks. In New York, the financing would be cut by 68 percent and the number of volunteers who receive stipends would be reduced, to 599 from 1,959. Nationwide, 20,000 out of 50,000 positions would be eliminated, AmeriCorps officials said.
"Here we are in the middle of a recession, and there are no jobs out there," said Representative Norman D. Dicks, Democrat of Washington. "Why would we do this to volunteers right now?" 
Mr. Dicks sponsored an amendment adding the $100 million that was defeated tonight by the appropriations committee in a party line vote. 
The Senate recently voted 71 to 21 to add $100 million for the program to a $1.9 billion spending bill for disaster appropriations.

In New York, Anniversaries Are Abundant

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
PERHAPS the most astonishing aspect of Central Park's 150th anniversary is that New York City threw a giant party to celebrate something done by the State Legislature.
 Albany honored downstate! It wasn't quite a "when pigs fly" idea, but it came awfully close, ranking with the Mets beating Atlanta, Leona Helmsley taking a vow of poverty and Donald Rumsfeld acknowledging fallibility. In short, it was an idea hovering at the outer edges of the possible, not something on which to bet the farm. 
 Yet over the weekend, it happened. By the many thousands, New Yorkers took part in festivities commemorating the day in 1853 -- the actual date was July 21, yesterday -- when the Legislature authorized the city to use its power of eminent domain to set aside land for a large, central park. 
There was much to celebrate. The park is New York's secular cathedral.
The celebration did make one wonder, though, why yesterday was designated the birthday. The date of conception seemed more like it. The birth, one could argue, did not come until 1858, when Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux produced their designs. Perhaps an even better candidate is 1859, when the park was opened to the public. Why not wait another five or six years for the party?
That's easy, said Regina S. Peruggi, president of the Central Park Conservancy. The legislative action in 1853 was "a visionary moment," she said yesterday. Without it, there would have been no park.
Sounds reasonable. So let's move on.
With all the hoopla over the park, some noteworthy New York anniversaries have not been getting their due. Not that every one has been overlooked. Far from it. Admirable attention has been paid to the fact that in the New York of 1853, Henry Steinway began producing his pianos and Elisha Graves Otis introduced his safety elevator.
But perhaps more than the sound of one hand clapping is in order for other events of 1853. That is when New York passed the first truancy law. According to Chase's Calendar of Events, a compendium of assorted factoids, parents were fined $50 if their children did not go to school.
FIFTY dollars was no doubt a great deal of money 150 years ago. If the city were to enforce a similar policy now -- no need to call it a ticket blitz -- inflation-adjusted truancy fines alone might go far to reduce the budget deficit.
Similarly given short shrift is the 1853 opening of a New York clinic for poor women and children. That was the work of Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to earn a medical degree in the United States.
But for neglect of a great New York moment, does anything beat the lack of cheering for the potato chip, invented 150 years ago this summer in Saratoga Springs?
As the story goes, George Crum, an American Indian chef in the upstate resort town, was having trouble pleasing a finicky diner who wanted French fries (as a certain kind of potato was known before freedom fries came along). Exasperated, Crum threw into the cooking oil some potatoes that he had cut paper thin, figuring the diner would hate them. He guessed wrong. If not for that mistake, we moderns might not be blessed with the crinkly bags carrying all those "nutrition facts" on the back.
Was that a big moment, or what? But you don't hear much about it, any more than we are told about some great events of 100 years ago.
Yes, we've heard plenty about the Williamsburg Bridge having been opened in 1903. But why do we overlook that, in the same year in New York, the ultimate barbershop quartet song, "Sweet Adeline," was performed publicly for the first time? It had music by Harry Armstrong and words by Richard Gerard, who later said that he had been inspired by a young woman working behind the music counter of a New York department store.
In 1903, the first World Series was played, with the Red Sox of Boston defeating the Pirates of Pittsburgh. This is an important milestone for New York because that Series led inexorably to George Steinbrenner's habitual tormenting of Yankees' players and managers.
And how can we not note that this year is the centennial of the first traffic cops in New York? Rule books then advised police officers on speed limits, right-of-way priorities and the like. For safety, passenger vehicles were permitted to go no faster than 8 miles per hour.
It just goes to show how much can change in the course of century. Eight miles an hour? Today, on Manhattan's crowded streets, that practically qualifies as a breakneck speed.

What's the Story Between the Lines At Fannie Mae?

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Fannie Mae has had a very good run.
 Powered by federal sponsorship that enables it to borrow money cheaply, Fannie Mae has become the most important company in the housing business, the strongest part of a struggling United States economy. Its assets have increased sevenfold since 1990, to nearly $900 billion, making it the second-largest financial institution in the United States, trailing only Citigroup. 
 Along the way, Fannie Mae's management has won accolades for its political and business savvy. Fannie Mae's stock gains and earnings have easily outgrown those of the average big company the last decade. In 2001, it was one of 11 profiled in "Good to Great," a best-selling business book about the best-run public companies. 
But in the last month -- in part because of missteps by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae's smaller corporate cousin -- Fannie Mae's golden glow has suddenly faded. Its accounting and business practices have come under sharp scrutiny.
Some institutional investors and analysts say that Fannie Mae has had billions of dollars of losses the last two years that have been obscuredby the complexity of its accounting. While those losses are deferred, they will hurt Fannie Mae in the future, cutting into its capital base and making it more vulnerable to a future downturn in housing prices or sharp changes in interest rates, they said.
James Bianco, president of Bianco Research in Chicago, said that Fannie Mae did not have enough equity capital to protect itself from a market downturn and that buyers of its debt did not seem to care because they believed that the government would protect them.
"The government should be very concerned that they have this out-of- control liability that's just leveraging itself up sky-high," he said. "It's a bad situation." Mr. Bianco said he was neither long nor short in Fannie Mae stock or debt.
In the early 1990's, Fannie Mae mainly insured mortgages held by other investors against default, an unglamorous but steadily profitable business. Today, it makes most of its money holding mortgages for itself, a much riskier business because mortgages can be prepaid if interest rates fall, making Fannie Mae subject to very complex risks related to changes in interest rates. Hoping to make bigger profits, the company has chosen not to hedge those risks, raising the possibility that a sharp move in interest rates could produce unexpected losses to taxpayers.
Last week, Fannie Mae said it would change its business strategy to take less risk. Some outside analysts say that it is still taking too much risk and that it needs to disclose more information about its giant mortgage portfolio. The company strongly disputes those contentions and says it provides investors with all the data they need.
In addition, Arne Christenson, senior vice president for regulatory policy at Fannie Mae, said that the company's decision to hold more mortgages had been good for homeowners. "Rates are lower as a result of our portfolio," he said. While Fannie Mae is very large, its size does not overwhelm the market in home mortgages, which is one of the world's largest.
For now, Fannie Mae's political base remains strong, and the federal sponsorship crucial to its growth appears safe. But with government agencies and critics looking closer than ever, Fannie Mae's red brick headquarters in northwest Washington is no longer an impregnable fortress. The next few months will be crucial for Fannie Mae, as it seeks to prove to investors and regulators that its portfolio has not grown unmanageably large and risky. 
Critics will try to force any number of changes on Fannie Mae -- from toughening the government's oversight of its operations to putting legal limits on its growth to stripping away its sponsorship.
If Fannie Mae succeeds in quieting the critics, it will still have to navigate choppy waters. Interest rates have risen sharply the last month and are expected to squelch the boom in refinancing from homeowners' trading in old loans for new ones at lower rates. The Mortgage Bankers Association recently predicted that rising rates would dampen new purchases and refinancing so much that the mortgage market would decline 43 percent next year.
The recent turbulence buffeting Fannie Mae began on June 9, when Freddie Mac surprised Wall Street and Washington with the departure of its top three executives and acknowledged that it had serious accounting problems.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are very similar companies. Both are owned by investors but operate under a government mandate to make homeownership more affordable by increasing the amount of capital available for mortgages. Together, they own or insure more than 40 percent of the mortgages in the United States.
While the two companies have the same mission, Fannie Mae is older and larger and is considered better managed and more politically savvy. Fannie Mae moved quickly to distinguish itself from the problems at Freddie Mac.
Investors seemed to agree. Fannie Mae shares fell less than 5 percent the day of Freddie Mac's announcement, while Freddie Mac shares plunged 16 percent.
For years, critics of both companies have said that accounting rules give them enormous flexibility to manage their earnings to meet Wall Street's expectations.
For example, by overestimating the losses they will have from delinquent mortgages, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can artificially lower their earnings in one quarter, creating a reserve to draw on in future periods to bolster profits. The companies repeatedly denied using such tricks, saying their steady earnings growth was simply the result of good management and growth in the mortgage market.
Freddie Mac subsequently acknowledged serious accounting problems, prompting some sophisticated institutional investors to re-examine the financial statements of both companies. What they found surprised them. Freddie Mac's accounting problems -- a combination of mistakes and efforts to build a reserve for bad times -- had actually lowered its pretax profits as much as $6.9 billion in 2002 and in earlier years.
While Freddie Mac's profits were understated, Fannie Mae's appeared to be overstated, according to these analysts. The divergent analysis reflects the different strategies used by the two companies, said Dwight Jaffee, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of California at Berkeley. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac profit from the spread in the interest they receive on the mortgages they own and the interest they pay on bonds they issue. But if interest rates fall and those mortgages are refinanced at lower rates, the companies can be caught paying more interest on debt than they receive on new mortgages.
Fannie Mae has bet wrongly since 2000 that interest rates would remain relatively flat and mortgage prepayments would not accelerate, Mr. Jaffee said. Freddie Mac has been more conservative, hedging away more risk.
Standard accounting rules do not fully measure the future effects of the refinancing that swept Fannie Mae's portfolio last year and this spring as interest rates fell, Mr. Jaffee and other critics said.
They said Fannie Mae appeared to have lost billions of dollars last year and billions more in its most recent quarter, when it reported $1.86 billion in "core business earnings," a nonstandard accounting measure, and $1.04 billion in earnings under standard accounting rules. The losses, they said, have cut into its capital, making it more vulnerable to a future downturn in housing prices or sharp changes in interest rates.
While Freddie Mac's stock has risen 2 percent since it plunged the day of its announcement, Fannie Mae's has continued to erode on fears of what might be ahead. Its shares closed yesterday at $65.32, down an additional 8 percent since the day of Freddie Mac's announcement.
The critics say that Fannie Mae should give investors more information about its portfolio, including the true market value of its assets and debts at the end of each quarter, a statement known as a fair-value or mark-to-market balance sheet. That information provides a straightforward way to determine whether Fannie Mae made or lost money in a quarter, said Lawrence Kam, president of Sonic Capital, a hedge fund in Boston that has sold Fannie Mae stock short in a bet it will decline.
Franklin D. Raines, Fannie Mae's chief executive, said Fannie Mae had not decided whether to provide a quarterly fair-value balance sheet. "We have serious questions as to whether a quarterly fair-value balance sheet would provide value to investors," he said. "It is an incomplete and, therefore, potentially misleading measure of the company's value as an ongoing business."
To determine a company's profit using a fair-value balance sheet, analysts subtract its debts from its assets to find the equity that belongs to shareholders. They then compare the company's equity with its equity in an earlier period, and adjust for payments it made to shareholders. The change represents the company's profit or loss.
Based on its fair-value balance sheet, Fannie Mae was barely profitable last year, critics say, even though it reported $6.4 billion in "core business earnings." Knowing how it performed in the second quarter is impossible because it did not release a fair-value balance sheet for the quarter, but other data released by the company point to a loss, they say. Many critics are short-sellers, who stand to profit if Fannie Mae's shares fall, but even some analysts who are bullish on the company think it should offer the balance sheet each quarter.
"Analysts and investors would find the mark-to-market helpful," said Kenneth Posner, a stock analyst at Morgan Stanley who rates Fannie Mae's stock outperform. Mr. Posner said that if he could choose either seeing only the financial information that Fannie Mae now releases or only the fair-value balance sheet each quarter, he would choose the balance sheet.
Last month, Freddie Mac said it would begin disclosing its fair-value balance sheet each quarter, though it has not yet done so. It has not yet provided investors with audited financial statements for 2002, as the accounting investigations continue. 
Chuck Greener, the Fannie Mae spokesman, said comparing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was unfair. Fannie Mae remains confident in its accounting and reported earnings, he said.
Fannie Mae's results are best measured by its "core earnings," which have grown strongly the last several years, and not its balance sheet, Mr. Greener said. And when it comes to disclosure, he said, Fannie Mae already provides investors with more information than do other financial companies.

HEADLINE: 19 Indicted in Florida In Case of Phony Drugs 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., July 21 

 BODY:
A Florida grand jury investigating pharmaceutical wholesalers has indicted 19 people on charges of peddling phony or diluted medications that are often prescribed for cancer and AIDS patients, the authorities said today.
 Investigators said that the defendants made tens of millions of dollars from the scheme, and that phony drugs found their way into common chains in Florida like Walgreen's and Eckerd drug stores. 
 "This isn't just about drugs being diverted or rediverted," said John O. Agwunobi, secretary of the Florida Department of Health. "It's also in some cases about empty bottles being filled with chalk and water and labeled with fake labels. In some cases it's about tap water being injected into bottles and sold as if it was a prescription drug." 
The charges involve drugs like Neupogen, which is often prescribed for cancer and H.I.V. patients; Gammagard, for H.I.V. patients; and Epogen, for patients with cancer, AIDS or kidney failure. The defendants are not accused of causing any deaths.
Last month, Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, signed into law a bill creating stricter permit rules for prescription drug wholesalers and harsher penalties for people who mislabel or counterfeit medicines.
Eighteen people were indicted today on a variety of charges including racketeering, conspiracy and other offenses associated with prescription drug fraud.
A second indictment accuses one man, Jose Grillo, 48, of relabeling Epogen to show that it was 20 times stronger than its actual potency so he could sell it for more.
Each count carries 5 to 30 years in prison. Investigators said the defendants made tens of millions of dollars from the scheme.
"It's hard to imagine a more heinous crime perpetrated upon an individual who's counting on what they believe to be a legitimate drug to save their lives," Attorney General Charles Crist said.
Dozens of the 1,458 wholesalers of prescription drugs in Florida were under investigation on suspicion that they had substituted genuine medications with weaker or bogus drugs. The authorities said the wholesalers put lives at risk because the tainted drugs were eventually sold to hospitals and pharmacies.
The authorities said that the 19 indicted individuals represented some of the most egregious criminals involved in a sophisticated scheme and that more indictments were expected.
Michael Mann of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said the investigation began with the 2001 arrest of a man caught stealing prescription drugs from a Miami hospital.
The suspect introduced the authorities into a black market "where drugs just basically go in loops where Medicaid may pay for the drugs once, maybe twice," Mr. Mann said. 
Many of the drugs were never refrigerated or properly maintained, he said.

HEADLINE: HARVESTING POVERTY; 
The Great Catfish War

 BODY:
For Tran Vu Long, who lives atop his floating catfish trap on the Mekong River near the border with Cambodia, the recent biannual harvest day was not the joyous payday it usually is. Mr. Long, a 35-year-old Vietnamese catfish farmer, sold his flapping fish -- 40 tons' worth, all painstakingly weighed and carried in bamboo buckets onto the trading company's launch -- at a loss of some $2,000, a small fortune here.
 Mr. Long, who stood sullenly to the side as his hired hands scooped out seemingly endless gaggles of fish from underneath the space that doubles as his living room, has Washington politicians to blame. "The United States preaches free trade, but as soon as we start benefiting from it, they change their tune," he said. 
 His misfortunes are just another part of the tale of how wealthy countries that preach the gospel of free trade when it comes to finding markets for their manufactured goods can become wildly protectionist when their farmers face competition. The fate of Vietnam's catfish offers a warning to poorer nations short on leverage in the world trading system: beware of what may happen if you actually succeed at playing by the big boys' rules.
After embracing decidedly un-Marxist reforms, Vietnam became one of globalization's brightest stories in the 1990's. The nation, a onetime rice importer, transformed itself into the world's second largest rice exporter and a player in the global coffee trade. The rural poverty rate was slashed to 30 percent from 70 percent.
The normalization of ties between Hanoi and Washington brought American trade missions bent on expanding Vietnamese free enterprise. One of these delegations saw in the Mekong Delta's catfish a golden export opportunity, with the region's natural conditions and cheap labor affording Vietnam a competitive advantage. Sure enough, within a few years, an estimated half-million Vietnamese were living off a catfish trade nurtured by private entrepreneurs. Vietnam captured 20 percent of the frozen catfish-fillet market in the United States, driving down prices. To the dismay of the Mississippi Farm Bureau, even some restaurants in that state -- the center of the American catfish industry -- were serving the Vietnamese species.
Soon Mr. Long and the other Vietnamese farmers were caught in a nasty two-front war being waged by the Catfish Farmers of America, the trade group representing Mississippi Delta catfish farmers. The Mississippi catfish farmers are generally not huge agribusinesses, and many of them struggle to make ends meet. But that still does not explain how the United States, the international champion of free market competition, could decide to rig the catfish game to cut out the very Vietnamese farmers whose enterprise it had originally encouraged.
Last year, with the aid of Trent Lott, then the Senate majority leader, the American catfish farmers managed to persuade Congress to overturn science. An amendment, improbably attached to an appropriations bill, declared that out of 2,000 catfish types, only the American-born family -- named Ictaluridae -- could be called "catfish." So the Vietnamese could market their fish in America only by using the Vietnamese terms "basa" and "tra." 
That was only the first step in a bipartisan assault. Congressman Marion Berry, an Arkansas Democrat, joined in a stupendously tactless disinformation campaign against the Vietnamese, suggesting that their fish were not good enough for American diners because they came from a place contaminated by so much Agent Orange -- sprayed over the countryside by American forces during the Vietnam War. Catfish Farmers of America, for its part, ran advertisements warning of a "slippery catfish wannabe," saying such fish were "probably not even sporting real whiskers" and "float around in Third World rivers nibbling on who knows what."
Not satisfied with its labeling triumph -- an old trade-war trick perfected by the Europeans -- the American group initiated an antidumping case against Vietnamese catfish. And for the purposes of this proceeding, Congressional taxonomy notwithstanding, the fish in question were once again regarded as catfish, not basa or tra. (Don't try explaining to Mr. Long how two branches of the American government, conveniently enough, can simultaneously maintain that his fish are two different creatures.)
Antidumping cases involve allegations that imports are being sold more cheaply than they are back home or below cost, practices rightly banned by trade laws. But too often, domestic industries allege dumping in an attempt to shield themselves from legitimate competition.
In this case, the Commerce Department had no evidence that the imported fish were being sold in America more cheaply than in Vietnam, or below their cost of production. But rather than abandoning the Mississippi catfish farmers to the forces of open competition, the department simply declared Vietnam a "nonmarket" economy. The designation allowed it simply to stipulate that there must be something suspect going on somewhere -- that Vietnamese farmers must not be covering all the costs they would in a functioning market economy. Tariffs ranging from 37 percent to 64 percent have been slapped by the department on Vietnamese catfish. 
Hence Mr. Long's hardship. Prices along the Mekong crashed, as the exporters who buy his fish moved to protect their margins. Many farmers are refusing to sell at a loss. Faced with the prospect of losing their investment, they might be shocked to learn that our Commerce Department says they do not operate in a free market.
The other shoe is expected to drop as early as tomorrow, when the United States International Trade Commission, an administrative agency in Washington, decides whether the American catfish industry was indeed hurt by unfair competition. Such a finding would make the tariffs permanent. 
There is usually a decided home-field advantage in these proceedings, but Vietnam's cause has been taken up by a half-dozen senators from both parties, led by John McCain, Hanoi's former prisoner. He considers this case not only naked protectionism but also a betrayal of the nation's strategic commitment to use trade to encourage change in a Communist society. 
Senator McCain is right. The catfish war is an obscure story here, but it is front-page news in Vietnam. Washington's solicitousness on behalf of a few thousand domestic catfish farmers has stirred a great deal of anti-American resentment in Vietnam, a country of 80 million, resurrecting images of an imperial bully. One lawyer on the case compares the Vietnamese public's strong interest in the catfish saga with Americans' obsession with the Lewinsky scandal.
This all saddens Nguyen Huu Dung, the general secretary of the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters, who said in a recent interview, "Our nation has a heavy history, and we try to forget it, try something new based on a spirit of cooperation and free trade, but now we are made to wonder whether you wish us ill, as much in the present as you did in the past."
We urge the International Trade Commission to listen to Senator McCain and his colleagues and decide this case on its merits. If not, Vietnam will become yet anothercase study in the way the United States, Europe and Japan are rigging global trade rules so they remain the only winners.

HEADLINE: MEASURE TO EASE IMPORTS OF DRUGS IS GAINING IN HOUSE 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and GARDINER HARRIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21 

 BODY:
A bill that would make it easier for Americans to import inexpensive prescription medicines from Canada and Europe is gathering support among some Republicans in the House of Representatives, prompting a furious effort by the pharmaceutical industry to defeat the legislation when it comes up for a vote later this week.
 The so-called "reimportation" bill, which would legalize the importation of drugs already sold in the United States, does not have the support of House Republican leaders. They are bringing it up for consideration as part of a deal they struck with a Missouri Republican, Representative Jo Ann Emerson, to secure Mrs. Emerson's vote in favor of a broad Medicare prescription drug benefit, a measure that is a priority of the White House. 
 Under the terms of that deal, the leaders promised not to fight the reimportation bill. Now, in a somewhat surprising turn, a number of Republicans say they intend to vote for it. 
In the past, many Republicans -- who tend to receive considerable financial support from drug makers -- have been inclined to accept the industry's arguments that imported drugs pose a safety risk and that higher prices in the United States are necessary so drug manufacturers can funnel the profits back into research and development. 
That sentiment appears to be changing. Lawmakers say they now recognize that many Americans are already buying medicines overseas, often through the mail or over the Internet, and that there have been few reports of people being hurt. They say they are also mindful that many voters are fed up with paying more than citizens in nations whose governments control prices. At the same time, as the federal government contemplates spending billions to provide the elderly with prescription drug coverage, even some Republicans say cheaper medicines would save the taxpayers money.
"I just think politically, this is an unsustainable scenario, where the American consumer is shouldering the bulk of research and development costs and corporate profits," said Representative Dave Weldon, a Florida Republican and a doctor who has opposed the legislation in the past but said he would probably vote in favor of it this time. "The drug companies have to come to terms with this."
Even opponents of the measure say they understand their fellow Republicans' frustration, a sentiment shared by many Democrats. 
"Obviously, people are distressed over the cost of drugs in this country, and I don't blame them," said Representative Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
But Mr. Tauzin, who is not bound by the leaders' agreement with Mrs. Emerson, said he was pressing lawmakers to vote against the measure, calling it "a disaster to the health and safety of Americans."
The reimportation issue is not new. Similar legislation passed Congress in 2000 and was signed into law by President Clinton, and both the House and Senate included reimportation provisions when they passed Medicare prescription drug legislation last month. 
But each of those measures included what Mrs. Emerson calls a "poison pill" -- a requirement that the secretary of health and human services certify that the imported drugs pose "no additional risk" to consumers. Both the Clinton and Bush administrations have refused to do so, preventing the program from taking effect.
As recently as Friday, the federal Food and Drug Administration sent a letter to Mr. Tauzin saying the agency had "serious public health concerns" about drugs imported from foreign sources, saying they may be poorly packaged and stored and are of "unknown quality."
The bill the House will consider this week, whose lead sponsors are Representative Gil Gutknecht, Republican of Minnesota, and Mrs. Emerson, does not include the certification requirement, but would require the F.D.A. to create and institute a system to grant individuals, pharmacists and wholesalers in the United States access to F.D.A.-approved drugs from industrialized nations abroad. The House defeated a similar measure in 2001, but Mr. Tauzin said today that the outcome this time was too close to call. 
If the bill passes, it will become the official House position in the Congressional negotiations to reconcile the differences in the House and Senate versions of the prescription drug benefit bill. That is one reason the industry is so nervous about it.
"We're fighting it tooth and nail," said Jeffrey Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry trade group.
The industry has sent armies of lobbyists to the Capitol to persuade lawmakers to oppose the measure and is helping to underwrite a nationwide radio advertising campaign. 
The industry trade group has also joined forces with abortion opponents, who recently sent fliers to voters saying the bill would allow Americans easy access to the abortion pill RU-486. The fliers, based on a legal memorandum drafted by the trade group, are sent specifically to conservatives who support the reimportation measure. One shows a baby and states that if the drug importation bill passes, abortion pills "may become as easy to get as aspirin." 
But the the mailings, which are sent by the Traditional Values Coalition, a California advocacy group led by the Rev. Louis Sheldon, have backfired, enraging some of the most conservative members of Congress, including Representatives Christopher Smith of New Jersey and Dan Burton of Indiana, both longtime opponents of abortion who support the drug importation bill.
"That is a bogus issue," Mr. Burton said.
Another industry-backed group, the Seniors Coalition, is running radio advertisements. Pfizer, one of the nation's largest drug companies, took out a full-page advertisement in Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, to publish a letter from its chief executive, Hank McKinnell, who says the proposal threatens the safety of the nation's drug supply.
"The F.D.A. would no longer be able to make sure that medications are stored and shipped safely," Mr. McKinnell wrote.
Drug manufacturers are among the biggest contributors to political campaigns; during the 2002 election cycle, the industry gave nearly $27 million to political candidates, three-quarters of it to Republicans. But one industry lobbyist said the manufacturers now worried that their success in the marketplace had become a political liability in Congress.
"There's this sense on the Hill that the industry is too rich for its own good," the lobbyist said. 
For the industry, the financial stakes in the reimportation fight could hardly be greater. The Gutknecht bill estimates that widespread drug importation could reduce average drug prices in the United States by 35 percent and drug spending by $635 million over 10 years. If passed, the bill could wreck the industry's carefully constructed worldwide pricing systems.
Last year, average drug prices in the United States were 67 percent higher than those in Canada and about twice those of Italy and France, according to a report by the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, a Canadian health agency. The United States spends 1.6 percent of its gross domestic product on drugs, compared with 0.6 percent in Germany and 0.9 percent in Canada, according to the report. The drug industry now gets more than half of its worldwide revenues from American consumers.
Industry executives argue that the proposed Medicare drug benefit will, on its own, help bring drug prices down. But some fear that the House and Senate Medicare negotiations will collapse, leaving the reimportation measure to gather steam.
"There is no reason why anybody should believe that, under a Medicare drug benefit, providers would not get a similar level of discounts," said Daniel Vasella, chief executive of the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis. "Importing from countries with a different drug review and approval process and regulated prices undermines the foundation of the American economy."
Still, many lawmakers are angry at the drug manufacturers. Mrs. Emerson said she was moved to support reimportation by caring for her elderly mother-in-law, who spends as much as $1,200 a month on prescription medicines. Mr. Burton, the congressman from Indiana, frequently refers to his wife's experience taking tamoxifen, the breast cancer drug, which he says costs $360 a month in the United States, compared with $60 a month in Germany.
"Every woman in America ought to be angry as hell at the pharmaceutical industry," Mr. Burton said, "and you can quote me on that."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
I.B.M. Explores Shift of Some Jobs Overseas

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
With American corporations under increasing pressure to cut costs and build global supply networks, two senior I.B.M. officials told their corporate colleagues around the world in a recorded conference call that I.B.M. needed to accelerate its efforts to move white-collar, often high-paying, jobs overseas even though that might create a backlash among politicians and its own employees.
 During the call, I.B.M's top employee relations executives said that three million service jobs were expected to shift to foreign workers by 2015 and that I.B.M. should move some of its jobs now done in the United States, including software design jobs, to India and other countries. 
 "Our competitors are doing it and we have to do it," Tom Lynch, I.B.M.'s director for global employee relations, said in the call. A recording was provided to The New York Times recently by the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, a Seattle-based group seeking to unionize high-technology workers. The group said it had received the recording -- which was made by I.B.M. and later placed in digital form on an internal company Web site -- from an I.B.M. employee upset about the plans. 
I.B.M.'s internal discussion about moving jobs overseas provides a revealing look at how companies are grappling with a growing trend that many economists call off-shoring. In decades past, millions of American manufacturing jobs moved overseas, but in recent years the movement has also shifted to the service sector, with everything from low-end call center jobs to high-paying computer chip design jobs migrating to China, India, the Philippines, Russia and other countries.
Executives at I.B.M. and many other companies argue that creating more jobs in lower cost locations overseas keeps their industries competitive, holds costs down for American consumers, helps to develop poorer nations while supporting overall employment in the United States by improving productivity and the nation's global reach.
"It's not about one shore or another shore," an I.B.M. spokeswoman, Kendra R. Collins, said. "It's about investing around the world, including the United States, to build capability and deliver value as defined by our customers."
But in recent weeks many politicians in Washington, including some in the Bush administration, have begun voicing concerns about the issue during a period when the economy is still weak and the information-technology, or I.T., sector remains mired in a long slump.
At a Congressional hearing on June 18, Bruce P. Mehlman, the Commerce Department's assistant secretary for technology policy, said, "Many observers are pessimistic about the impact of offshore I.T. service work at a time when American I.T. workers are having more difficulty finding employment, creating personal hardships and increasing demands on our safety nets."
Forrester Research, a high-technology consulting group, estimates that the number of service sector jobs newly located overseas, many of them tied to the information technology industry, will climb to 3.3 million in 2015 from about 400,000 this year. This shift of 3 million jobs represents about 2 percent of all American jobs.
"It's a very important, fundamental transition in the I.T. service industry that's taking place today," said Debashish Sinha, principal analyst for information technology services and sourcing at Gartner Inc., a consulting firm. "It is a megatrend in the I.T. services industry."
Forrester also estimated that 450,000 computer industry jobs could be transferred abroad in the next 12 years, representing 8 percent of the nation's computer jobs. 
For example, Oracle, a big maker of specialized business software, plans to increase its jobs in India to 6,000 from 3,200, while Microsoft plans to double the size of its software development operation in India to 500 by late this year. Accenture, a leading consulting firm, has 4,400 workers in India, China, Russia and the Philippines.
Critics worry that such moves will end up doing more harm to the American economy than good.
"Once those jobs leave the country, they will never come back," said Phil Friedman, chief executive of Computer Generated Solutions, a 1,200-employee computer software company. "If we continue losing these jobs, our schools will stop producing the computer engineers and programmers we need for the future."
In the hourlong I.B.M. conference call, which took place in March, the company's executives were particularly worried that the trend could spur unionization efforts.
"Governments are going to find that they're fairly limited as to what they can do, so unionizing becomes an attractive option," Mr. Lynch said on the recording. "You can see some of the fairly appealing arguments they're making as to why employees need to do some things like organizing to help fight this."
The I.B.M. executives also warned that when workers from China come to the United States to learn to do technology jobs now being done here, some American employees might grow enraged about being forced to train the foreign workers who might ultimately take away their jobs.
"One of our challenges that we deal with every day is trying to balance what the business needs to do versus impact on people," Mr. Lynch said. "This is one of these areas where this challenge hits us squarely between the eyes."
Mr. Lynch warned that with the American economy in an "anemic" state, the difficulties and backlash from relocating jobs could be greater than in the past.
"The economy is certainly less robust than it was a decade ago," Mr. Lynch said, "and to move jobs in that environment is going to create more challenges for the reabsorption of the people who are displaced."
The I.B.M. executives said openly that they expected government officials to be angry about this trend.
"It's hard for me to imagine any country just sitting back and letting jobs go offshore without raising some level of concern and investigation," Mr. Lynch said.
Those concerns were pointedly raised on June 18, when the House Small Business Committee held a hearing on "The Globalization of White-Collar Jobs: Can America Lose These Jobs and Still Prosper?"
"Increased global trade was supposed to lead to better jobs and higher standards of living," said Donald A. Manzullo, an Illinois Republican who is the committee chairman. "The assumption was that while lower-skilled jobs would be done elsewhere, it would allow Americans to focus on higher-skilled, higher-paying opportunities. But what do you tell the Ph.D., or professional engineer, or architect, or accountant, or computer scientist to do next? Where do you tell them to go?"
The technology workers' alliance is highlighting I.B.M.'s outsourcing plans to help rally I.B.M. workers to the union banner.
"It's a bad thing because high-tech companies like I.B.M., Microsoft, Oracle and Sun, are making the decision to create jobs overseas strictly based on labor costs and cutting positions," said Marcus Courtney, president of the group, an affiliate of the Communications Workers of America. "It can create huge downward wage pressures on the American work force."
Mr. Mehlman, the Commerce Department official, said companies were moving more service jobs overseas because trade barriers were falling, because India, Russia and many other countries have technology expertise, and because high-speed digital connections and other new technologies made it far easier to communicate from afar.
Another important reason for moving jobs abroad is lower wages. 
"You can get crackerjack Java programmers in India right out of college for $5,000 a year versus $60,000 here," said Stephanie Moore, vice president for outsourcing at Forrester Research. "The technology is such, why be in New York City when you can be 9,000 miles away with far less expense?"
Company executives say this strategy is a vital way to build a global company and to serve customers around the world.
General Electric has thousands of workers in India in call center, research and development efforts and in information technology. Peter Stack, a G.E. spokesman, said, "The outsourcing presence in India definitely gives us a competitive advantage in the businesses that use it. Those businesses are some of our growth businesses, and I would say that they're businesses where our overall employment is increasing and our jobs in the United States." 
David Samson, an Oracle spokesman said the expansion of operations in India was "additive" and was not resulting in any jobs losses in the United States.
"Our aim here is not cost-driven," he said. "It's to build a 24/7 follow-the-sun model for development and support. When a software engineer goes to bed at night in the U.S., his or her colleague in India picks up development when they get into work. They're able to continually develop products."

U.S. Troops Land in Liberia As Fighting Engulfs Capital
United States marines arrived to protect the American Embassy and evacuate foreigners from the Liberian capital of Monrovia as fighting raged and as residents lay bodies of their loved ones at the shuttered gate to the embassy.

HEADLINE: Back-to-School Survival; 
Sales AreThin, Customers Bored; It's Time for 'Quality'

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
The cover of the new J. Crew catalog shows an orangy-red corduroy jacket over a green cashmere-blend sweater and a pink oxford shift. In contrast to last fall's catalog, with its drab colors and Vaseline focus, this year's crisply portrays each color-dyed stitch, each wool strand, each tiny pearl collar button. 
 The unspoken message is that J. Crew is selling quality this fall. Faced with a dismal spring and summer for business, other merchants are also striving to reposition themselves in hopes of salvaging a year battered by dismal spring weather, the Iraq war and the unrelenting boredom of shoppers. 
 For the back-to-school season, American Eagle Outfitters is promoting nostalgia. Introducing its "classic jeans," the company's Web site shows teenagers making out in the black-and-white past, next to blue-jeaned teenagers making out now, in color. The message stamped across the pictures: "Reissue."
Brooks Brothers is upgrading its fabrics and redoing its style, harking back to 1930's, 40's and 50's designs from its archives. The Gap is revamping its boys' and young men's clothes. The Children's Place is improving the fit and finishes of its girls' and boys' jeans, along with its corduroy, for the same prices as last year.
Merchants have little choice but to deliver more and better merchandise; increasingly, they concede, the old formulas are not working; consumers are saying that all the clothes in the stores look alike. After being stable for decades, sales in the back-to-school season -- July, August and September -- were down 9 percent in 2002. 
"Everyone is on pins and needles, hoping this back-to-school kind of saves the difficult business we've had in spring and summer," said Mary Gleason, president and chief executive of Group Three, a company that oversees design and marketing for Bugle Boy and a handful of other clothing brands. "We've seen a decrease in orders; we've had cancellations and stores holding goods until next year. The stores are re-evaluating their buying plans."
Young customers are making the calculations harder for retailers by delaying their purchases of back-to-school clothes. "More and more, the kids don't want to shop until they're already back to school -- and see what the other kids are wearing," said Marshal Cohen, senior analyst for the NPD Group, a market research company. Retailers are deciding whether to mark down goods earlier than ever.
Over the last three years, Americans have come to depend on bargain sales, and revenue per store has dropped for many retailers. That seems to prove that customers mean what they have been telling pollsters: They are bored, and sales, sales, sales are no longer enough to lure them to the mall. Numbers even for Wal-Mart and Target, the champions of low-priced merchandise, lately have come in below estimates. 
This fall, Wal-Mart will introduce a less expensive line of Levi's jeans, the first time it has offered the brand. Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, may be ahead of a trend. According to a survey by NPD of 5,000 families last week, expensive jeans are passe for the fall.
Other likely back-to-school losers, NPD said, include many of last year's moneymakers: cellphones (most young people already have them), desktop and notebook computers, mini-refrigerators and digital cameras.
What's in? The newest lines of jeans (again), surfing-oriented clothes, cargo pants and athletic apparel.
Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at Deloitte Research, predicted in an interview that the back-to-school season might succeed in bailing out the clothing industry, at least temporarily. He cited two factors: the spate of mortgage refinancing that is giving Americans more cash to spend and the $400 checks, on average, that with the recent increase in the tax credit for children, the government will be sending to 25 million families. (Checks are being mailed on Friday, an I.R.S. spokesman said.)
To win its share of such money, J. Crew -- now under the guidance of Millard Drexler, the former Gap chief executive -- says it is returning to a tradition of preppy, quality goods that in recent years has been diluted. It is adding pleats to the backs of its shirts and having them made in Italy instead of China. Shoes are being made in Italy, too. Trousers will fit better. 
Some of the prices are going up at J. Crew -- but not at the Children's Place, where jeans for boys and girls remain two for $25, even though "the fit is much improved and the washes are softer," said Nina Miner, vice president for trend and design at the chain, which has 671 stores.
Other merchants will be selling quality as well. Starter, the athletic-wear maker whose lines include the one endorsed by Shaquille O'Neal, promises more wicking for moisture control. Delia's and Wet Seal, chains of youth-oriented stores that sell their own jeans brands, are saying that their pants will be more stylish. Bugle Boy makes claims for both the style and durability of its new jeans.
"Quality is definitely an issue," Ms. Gleason of Group Three said. "The stores are expecting more quality for the same price."
J. C. Penney is upgrading some of its private-label clothing. "We've beefed up our in-house design team to bring more fashion to the fore in our Arizona jeans," a spokesman, Tim Lyons, said. For fall, Penney's will have new stretch corduroy jeans with a lower rise, and will cut the number of jeans styles, trying to "chase the winners and eliminate the clunkers," Mr. Lyons said.
That fairly well sums up every merchant's mission. To induce today's customer to buy, "we know we're going to have to hit her in the eye," Ms. Miner of the Children's Place said. "We've got to catch her 14 feet away in the mall. Price alone is not going to do it."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Low-Cost AirlinesBecome Big Spenders

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
Like lottery winners unleashed on Fifth Avenue, low-cost airlines in the United States and Europe are snapping up planes at a frenzied pace. They want to grow, and they want to grow fast.
 Among the shoppers are AirTran Airways of Orlando, Fla., which ordered 50 Boeing 737's on June 30, and Britain's easyJet, which in October said it was buying 120 Airbus A320's. 
 By volume, such deals by this new generation of carriers involve some of the biggest aircraft sales in years. Low-cost airlines accounted for 61 percent of narrow-body jet orders so far this year and 75 percent last year, for a total of 385 planes. In 2001, the rate was just 15.5 percent, or only 39 jets, according to Back Aviation Solutions, an industry consulting firm. 
Executives say the planes are needed to fuel double-digit capacity expansion over the next several years. That in turn is crucial to capturing market share and meeting increasing demand, they say. But given the generally eviscerated state of air travel, are the low-cost airlines trying to grow too quickly?
At Ryanair, the Irish discount carrier that is adding seats at a faster rate than any other European airline, the percentage of filled seats has dipped this year. Chris Avery, a J. P. Morgan Chase analyst, downgraded its stock rating July 14, citing a "weaker earnings growth year" because of "excessive capacity expansion."
In the United States, the economic downturn is so serious that Southwest Airlines, the world's most profitable carrier ever, is tempering its growth even as younger low-cost peers push ahead with ambitious expansion plans.
Though industry experts and former executives say the growth rates could be manageable, given both the current trends in passenger spending and the track record of executives at the low-cost airlines, they also warn of possible pitfalls.
"The People Express issue is still relevant in the sense that some of these guys could be lured into a higher-than-rational growth environment," said Robert W. Mann, an industry consultant in Port Washington, N.Y., referring to the no-frills upstart of the 1980's that foundered after expanding too quickly.
But Mr. Mann added: "I have always felt there was an insatiable desire for travel at the right price. In that sense, as long as they can continue to produce travel in popular markets at the right price, the sky's the limit."
Donald Burr, the founder of People Express, said that the three interrelated problems that hampered his airline -- too-rapid expansion, hubris from the company's initial success and lack of proper information technology -- could spell the downfall of companies in the current start-up crop if they are not cautious.
"One has to be very careful about managing success," said Mr. Burr, who still follows the industry. "When you're very successful, you've really got to get your paranoia up."
There is little doubt anymore that low-cost airlines not only are here to stay, but have also become the trendsetters of the industry, pushing air travel in directions that the traditional carriers are struggling to follow.
Industry experts say this is only the beginning of a huge change in air travel that was set off a quarter-century ago by American deregulation. But the very success of the low-cost business model -- and consequently its popularity among entrepreneurs -- makes the environment more cutthroat than when Southwest started in the 1970's.
With so many low-cost airlines popping up and expanding quickly, the number of routes where they compete is increasing. In the Los Angeles market, for example, Southwest, AirTran and JetBlue Airways already overlap on several routes.
In Europe, low-cost airlines are growing even faster and struggling to maintain success.
Ryanair shook up investors this month when it reported that its planes were only 79 percent full in June, versus 88 percent a year earlier. Michael O'Leary, the chief executive, warned that for the full year the airline's load factor -- or percentage of seats filled -- would drop to about 80 percent, from 85 percent in 2002.
Nevertheless, the airline is moving ahead with its sweeping growth plans. The company has ordered 125 737's from Boeing since the start of 2002, with an option for 125 more. It will take delivery of 18 jets this fiscal year and intends to increase capacity by 60 percent over the period, as well as by 20 to 25 percent a year for the next several years, said Sean Coyle, a company spokesman. Part of that, Mr. Coyle said, will come from entering more airports in Europe -- it currently operates out of four on the Continent -- and adding 20 to 30 routes a year.
"It's part of the long-term plan; nothing has really changed from a growth perspective for Ryanair," Mr. Coyle said. "I don't think there's any question that this year's growth rate in terms of capacity is large. From a safety perspective, we have it well under control. From a financial management perspective, we have it well under control."
But some industry experts are asking about the capital outlay that will be required for Ryanair's expansion. And they are watching the growing competition across Europe -- most obviously from easyJet, which is also in a rapid expansion mode, having ordered 120 A320's last year and aiming for capacity growth of 25 percent a year until 2007. Newer low-cost airlines are also emerging in markets that Ryanair wants to enter, including cities in Central and Eastern Europe.
"When I look at guys who are growing very fast and may have trouble, I look across the water to a guy like Ryanair," said Mr. Mann, the industry consultant. "He's growing very rapidly, he's got an apparent appetite for new airplanes. He's going to a lot of different markets, adding complexity."
But Mr. Mann added that the opportunities for expansion are larger in Europe than in the United States because deregulation is at an early stage in most countries there.
Daniel Solon, an industry analyst for Avmark International in Barcelona, Spain, said that capacity growth rates for Ryanair and easyJet looked reasonable, given the steady delivery schedule of their aircraft orders. Ryanair has spread delivery of its 125 Boeing jets from this year to 2009, while easyJet will take delivery of its 120 Airbus planes until 2007. Mr. Solon added that it made sense for the airlines to take advantage of the current slump in airplane sales to major carriers to negotiate favorable deals with Boeing and Airbus.
Low-cost airlines on this side of the Atlantic have also placed major orders recently, though not as large as those in Europe. In mid-June, JetBlue signed up for 100 regional jets from Embraer of Brazil. Two months earlier, it ordered 65 Airbus A320's. It said its capacity would grow 55 to 60 percent this year.
AirTran plans to increase capacity by 25 percent a year for the next few years with the 50 737's and six 717's it just ordered from Boeing. Its current fleet -- 64 717's and 8 DC-9's -- has limited flying range. The 737's will allow it to add transcontinental routes and possibly service to Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean.
"We still think it's very controlled growth," said Joseph Leonard, AirTran's chief executive. "If we find we're growing too fast, we'll slow it down. We will not outgrow our profitability."
Southwest has chosen not to increase its capacity as quickly as either AirTran or JetBlue. For one thing, Southwest is already much larger than either of the upstarts. Besides, Herbert D. Kelleher, Southwest's legendary founder, has always preached measured growth.
From 1991 through 2000, Southwest increased its capacity by an average of 14 percent a year. That slowed to 9 percent in 2001, 5 percent in 2002 and will most likely be 4 percent this year. The company said yesterday that it would speed up plane deliveries next year and increase capacity by 6 to 7 percent. 
"We need to grow at a pace that we feel we can manage and that the current economic environment can support, regardless of what our competition is doing," said Gary C. Kelly, Southwest's chief financial officer. "If we can grow faster comfortably, then we'll do that."
Southwest, though, will inevitably end up competing more and more with other low-cost airlines on some routes as those carriers expand. It now overlaps directly with three other low-cost airlines on 14 routes, and that is not counting metropolitan areas where Southwest and low-cost rivals fly into separate but nearby airports.
Mr. Burr, the People Express founder, said there were lessons to be learned from the implosion of his company. Capacity grew at an average rate of 137 percent a year from People Express's start in 1981 to 1985. But its load factor fell from 74.6 percent in 1983 to 69.8 percent the next year. In 1986, when People Express was sold to Continental Airlines, the load factor was 58.6 percent.
Contributing to his airline's decline, Mr. Burr said, was the reluctance of executives, guided by early success, to change anything about their product, even as rivals were thinking up new ways to steal market share.
"The public wants an improved product all the time," he said. "People Express didn't refresh its product. The minute you think you're going to produce a commodity product at the lowest possible price, someone else will come along and produce that, but give people a better product. They'll have better on-time performance, ticket you better, give you TV or whatever."
Mr. Burr also said People Express's computers were not sophisticated enough to deal with frequent-flier programs or a complex ticket pricing strategy called yield management that American Airlines popularized in the mid-80's. American quickly moved in for the kill, taking out ads that said it was matching People Express's fares in all markets where the two competed. Almost overnight, Mr. Burr said, his airline's percentage of filled seats plummeted.
These days, though, the traditional carriers are in no shape to knock anyone out. United is trying to restructure in bankruptcy court, American is struggling to avoid a trip there, and their biggest competitors are desperately flailing away. And in the short term, at least, the growth of low-cost airlines will more likely than not leave the old guard with another round of bruises and black eyes.

Now, many of them are expanding in an effort to duplicate the success of Southwest Airlines.

HEADLINE: Sleepover Camps That Redefine Notions of 'Away' 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: MINISINK, N.Y., July 15

Wearing a harness over her swimsuit, and smiling as she waited to be whisked across a lake on a giant clothesline-like contraption, 14-year-old Ayn Wisler ticked off everything that was wrong with her last sleepaway camp. Uniforms were required. Campers are allowed to spend only 75 cents a week on candy. Worst of all, she said, calls home were expressly forbidden.
 Her new camp here, one of three Campus Kids camps in the New York region, not only lets her call home. It lets her go home, every weekend, to see her parents in Westfield, N.J. 
 A growing number of sleepaway camps are tinkering with the traditional model that has long defined camps in the Northeast -- an eight-week program with limited parental contact -- to accommodate the changing needs and expectations of campers and their families. As a result, campers have more variety in how long they stay, and more chances to stay connected to home. 
For some camps, like Camp Taconic in Hinsdale, Mass., that means a liberal policy about phone calls home. For Cheley Colorado Camps in Estes Park, Colo., which has offered eight-week sessions typical of Northeastern camps, it now means posting 75 images of campers on the Web each day; parents can feel as if they are looking through a one-way mirror. Those images helped reassure parents last summer that the children were safe when fires raged a few miles from the camp, said Jeff Cheley, the camp's director of operations.
For others, like Camp Echo in Burlingham, N.Y., it means offering two-way e-mail. It is far more common to provide a one-way system: parents can send messages that are printed and delivered every day with the regular mail, but children still need stamps to reply.
Campus Kids has gone further than most in redefining the traditions of sleepaway camp. It operates only Monday through Friday, so that children spend each weekend with their families. It also lets parents drive up the weekend before camp to help the children unpack, and it lets campers call home often. 
"For a lot of families, that's very comforting," said Tom Riddleberger, one of the camp's founders.
Officials at the American Camping Association say they have no figures on how many of the nation's 8,000 sleepaway camps are changing the old ways. But they and others in the industry say they have seen a trend, particularly in the last few years, toward a new flexibility.
A company called Bunk1.com says it provides e-mail or photo services for about 1,200 camps, and another company, eCamp, says it serves hundreds more.
"Parents are wanting a higher level of communication, and many camps are acceding to that in a controlled fashion," said Marla Coleman, the president of the American Camping Association and the owner of Camp Echo. 
Campus Kids, a privately owned camp, began modestly 12 years ago on a college campus in Hackettstown, N.J., hence the name. But it later added another site in Middlebury, Conn., and two years ago opened a third here in Minisink, not far from the borders of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. This year, nearly 1,400 children will attend the three camps, paying $1,400 to $5,300 depending on their length of stay. The company says it has been taking 100 more children each summer. 
Industry officials, camp directors, consultants and parents cite several reasons why some families are switching from traditional camps. Shorter stays help save money in a poor economy, and affluent families appear to want shorter sessions as a way to cram a wider variety of experiences into one summer.
Griffin Katz, 10, of Westport, Conn., for instance, is attending seven weeks of Campus Kids in Minisink and spent an additional week at a lacrosse camp on Long Island. And, much as Ayn Wisler loves Campus Kids, she signed up for only four weeks, so she would have time to swim with the dolphins in Orlando, Fla., this summer.
Some of the newer weekday-only arrangements and shorter sessions cater to parents who want their children to experience sleepaway camping but want to spend time with them, too. Some of the parents seeking that flexibility are divorced and are eager to preserve their allotted time with the child; others are working parents who have little free time during the week but want their children around when they have time off.
"For a working mom, this is a great alternative," said Barbara Fitter, a vice president of publicity at Random House in New York whose 10-year-old son, Matt, is at Minisink. She drops him off at a park-and-ride lot near home in Westport, Conn., each Monday before catching her own train to Manhattan and then meets him each Friday, with his favorite sushi for the ride home. The camp's buses do the rest.
"I'm working all week, but on weekends, I love to be with him," she said. "It's guiltless."
Some parents are anxious about sending children far away after the terror attacks and other scares of the past two years. "We think it's important for a child to stay in touch with their family," Robert Ezrol, the director of Camp Taconic, said in explaining his camp's liberal use of the telephone. "9/11 reinforced the validity of that."
Anxiety was one reason Cyndy Salvo of Greenwich, Conn., was at the Noroton Heights train station in Darien one recent Monday morning with about 10 other parents. Clutching a bag of freshly washed laundry, she was putting her 10-year-old daughter, Valerie, on a bus to the Campus Kids camp in Connecticut.
"Valerie went to sleepaway camp in North Carolina last year, and the policy was no communication with parents," Ms. Salvo said. "This year, we decided being a little closer to home would be nice." Seeing so much of her child all summer, she added, "takes all the anxiety out of it for a mother."
Counselors say they like the camps, too, because they are less likely to burn out with weekends off. The Campus Kids camps in Connecticut and New Jersey are on college campuses, so counselors and campers are using dormitory rooms and indoor swimming pools -- not exactly roughing it. The newer 500-acre site in Minisink is more traditional, with log cabins for bunkhouses and two lakes, fondly called Root Beer Lake and Iced Tea Lake because of their hue.
"When we started, we fully expected to be a feeder system for the rest of the industry," said Mr. Riddleberger. "We were pleasantly surprised that lots of kids stay with us for many years. So it's not just an introduction for many people, but a lifestyle choice."
Alex Braverman, 10, said as much in explaining why he liked the Minisink camp. "Weekends off are good because you get to see your regular friends and family, and you don't get homesick," he said. 
Not every wish is accommodated. Although many parents want their children to take along cellphones, officials at Campus Kids and other camps have resisted the idea. And not everyone is a fan of these experiments in camping. Some traditional camps say that technology has no place in sleepaway camp. 
"That's just not the ethos and culture of this camp," said Rob Schultz, the executive director of the Farm and Wilderness Foundation. He runs six camps in Plymouth, Vt., that make limited use of electricity and offer activities like baking bread and picking blueberries. "Families choose Farm and Wilderness because they want a rustic, outdoor simple adventure," he said. "They like that their kids are unplugging."
Others simply feel that children will have an easier time overcoming homesickness and forming relationships with others if their parents let go. "There's such an investment in each other that you get" in a traditional sleepaway camp, said Donna Okin, a camp consultant in Morris Plains, N.J., who recommends camps to parents.
Andrew Schultz of Stamford, Conn., said his 16-year-old son attended Campus Kids some years ago and felt like a yo-yo. Just when the boy stopped feeling homesick, he would board the bus home, and just when he was settling in at home, it was time to leave. "I would never do it again," Mr. Schultz said.
So far, camp directors say they expect they will never see the day that webcams are installed to truly bring the children's experience home to parents.
Not that parents have not asked. "We have lots of crazy parents asking for it," said Seth Hirschel, a founder of eCamp in Lakeville, Conn. "We try not to feed their neuroses too much."

HEADLINE: HARBOR MASTER: A Fleet and How It Grew; 
Ferry Operator's Dominance Draws Rivals' Anger

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI and KEVIN FLYNN 

 BODY:
No one is laughing at Arthur's Folly anymore.
 Arthur E. Imperatore Sr., a tough-talking former trucker, has turned his romantic notion of reviving ferry service in New York Harbor into a $73-million-a-year business that some experts say is a model for privately run mass transit. 
 His lone ferry of 17 years ago has grown into a fleet of 48 catamarans and other vessels that operate 25 routes between New Jersey and New York. In the past three years, ridership at his company, New York Waterway, has increased to 60,000 daily, and profits have tripled to $6 million a year. His boats carry more than 90 percent of the private ferry passengers in the harbor. 
"We are a dedicated, innovative company that has almost single-handedly reinvented a dead industry," said Arthur E. Imperatore Jr., 40, who now runs the company founded by his 77-year-old father.
To the Imperatores and the government agencies and officials who have assisted the company in its rise, New York Waterway's dominance is entirely justified: it was in the business first, was steadfast in its commitment through lean years and has been a proven, reliable operator in meeting the region's growing demand.
But to others, chiefly Waterway's emerging rivals in the industry, the company's virtual monopoly has been helped by what they see as its status as a favorite of government.
The government has given it $27 million in subsidies and $26 million in loan guarantees, and is paying $250 million to build four terminals that Waterway will operate. Some of the financing is the first Federal Transit Administration money ever spent on a privately run ferry terminal.
The company has hired a government regulator who once oversaw the ferry business, and the Imperatores, their companies and associates have plowed a quarter of a million dollars into the campaigns of government officials in Albany, New York City and even Alaska, the home state of a congressman who helps oversee the industry.
Now the United States attorney's office in Manhattan and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have opened a joint inquiry into Waterway's performance. In addition to investigating claims by rivals that Waterway has improperly limited competition by hoarding boats and controlling access to landings, investigators are exploring whether it defrauded the federal government out of hundreds of thousands of dollars in emergency money provided after Sept. 11, 2001, an allegation the company has denied.
"I think it's obvious that Waterway has a favorite-son status with the Port Authority," said Bruce Boyle, who runs a ferry service to Manhattan from Jersey City. He has told regulators that he has been barred from certain landings controlled by Waterway.
In New York, ferry feuds date back two centuries to the rivalry between Col. John Stevens, a maritime engineer, and Robert Fulton, whose steamboats dominated the harbor. The Imperatores say the allegations against them have sprung from similar antagonism. Among those challenging Waterway for a share of the market is New York Water Taxi, whose chairman, Douglas Durst, is an influential Manhattan developer.
"Our accomplishments," said Arthur Imperatore Jr., "clearly have generated envy and resentment among certain other operators who can only benefit from having us under a cloud."

An Industry Is Reborn
Arthur Imperatore Sr. displayed a gambler's nerve in 1986 when he opened the first ferry service in two decades between New Jersey and Manhattan.
He had already earned a fortune as the owner of a short-haul trucking company, APA Transport. His businesses were a major distributor for The New York Times. He was celebrated for having stood up to organized crime.
"The trucking industry," he once said, "is not to be confused with Sunday school."
But real estate was a new venture for Mr. Imperatore when he bought two miles of dilapidated New Jersey waterfront between Weehawken and West New York. He envisioned a $5 billion Venetian city, complete with tree-lined canals, hotels and town houses.
The ferry would help to market the development by making Manhattan more accessible. It ran to a run-down railroad pier the company had bought at West 38th Street, and it quickly developed a nickname, Arthur's Folly. To his critics, Mr. Imperatore's plan was a testament to hubris. But unlike prior ferry operators, he had recognized the need to use buses to shuttle customers from remote waterfront landings to Midtown office towers.
"Arthur was a visionary," said Gene Heller, who as an executive at Hartz Mountain sold a ferry business to the Imperatores in the late 1980's.
Mr. Imperatore's city never came to pass, but his ferry business grew. In 1988, the Port Authority hired him to run boats between Hoboken and the World Financial Center to relieve overcrowding on the PATH trains.
The company lost money for its first seven years, officials said. But Mr. Imperatore added routes and pressed employees on the little things, like litter in the parking lot. "The old man, in my mind, carved something out of nothing," said Robert Bekoff, a former New York ferry operator.

A Flurry of Networking
For all his pioneering style as a businessman, Mr. Imperatore also understood the power of political friendship.
Fund-raising dinners were often held for allies like Gov. George E. Pataki or Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at the Imperatore family's waterfront restaurant in Weehawken. Two New Jersey officials who could be counted on in Washington, Senator Frank Lautenberg and Representative Robert A. Roe, had ferries named after them. The company hired lobbyists in New York City, Albany, Trenton and Washington.
"Mr. Imperatore courted everyone and everybody he could," said Jack Davis, a former Port Authority ferry official. He recalled a party on Mr. Imperatore's 142-foot yacht on a Halloween night 10 years ago with other authority executives and the mayors of towns along the New Jersey shoreline.
Mr. Bekoff, who now runs ferries in Florida, said he tried to enter the New York market in the late 1990's but gave up after losing $1 million because he could not compete with Mr. Imperatore's contacts. "Could I hire people to run and build the boats? No sweat," he said. "Did I have a lobbyist in Trenton, in New York City? Did I know the guy who knew the guy? No."
The Port Authority's former supervisor of ferry programs was among those the company wooed. The supervisor, Donald J. Liloia, was overseeing the ferry industry, including New York Waterway, in 1995 when the company asked if he would join it as a top executive. At that point, Mr. Liloia said, he recused himself from direct oversight of Waterway. He took the job three months later.
Within a year, Mr. Liloia said, he had helped New York Waterway draft its bid for a contract with the Port Authority, which it ultimately won. The agency's ethics code at the time barred former employees from representing outside vendors for two years after their departure. Mr. Liloia said he attended only one meeting about the contract and does not recall ever being told of such a restriction.

An Unexpected Demand
By 2001, New York Waterway had expanded to the point where it had five routes to Manhattan just from Jersey City and little serious competition. Then the World Trade Center was attacked.
On that day, Waterway boats spent hours transporting survivors. On subsequent days, with PATH tunnels in ruins, many commuters turned to ferries, and other companies began eyeing the market.
In two months, Waterway's ridership jumped to 52,000 passengers a day from 33,000. "We had five years of growth in six months," Arthur Imperatore Jr. said.
In fact, officials feared that without the ferries, the economy of Lower Manhattan might itself collapse. To help, the federal government agreed to subsidize four new ferry routes and increase service on another. Other companies were seriously contending for business. But all five contracts went to New York Waterway, three of them without public bidding.
To the Port Authority, which administered the contracts, the awards made sense. Waterway was well financed, had plenty of boats and, in one instance, already held the contract to provide the service the government sought to expand. But to other operators, who knew the contracts were potentially worth millions of dollars in subsidies, the awards were not warranted.
New York Water Taxi challenged several of them, including the decision not to seek bids on a $3 million contract to carry people from Hunters Point in Queens to Manhattan.
Port Authority officials at the time said they had to award the contract to Waterway because it had a lease on the authority's landing at Hunters Point, from which it had operated for years.
But Waterway had shut down service there months earlier, citing low ridership, and, with the authority's permission, had not paid rent in several years.
Water Taxi said the lease was a flimsy reason to abandon public bidding. Authority officials said they still felt a legal obligation to Waterway, which resumed the service last September. They deny the assertion that they have favored the company.
"Up until recent years," the authority said in a statement, "N.Y. Waterway was the only operator to respond to our requests for proposal."

A Flood of Help
The $27 million that the federal government ultimately provided for emergency ferry service after Sept. 11 was supposed to ensure that boats would be ready when commuters needed them, and it did. Paul Ward, who was Waterway's senior operations manager, recalled in an interview the many nights he watched ferry after ferry plow into the waters between Hoboken and Lower Manhattan. He did not like what he saw.
The federal government had agreed to pay to increase ferry services, as much as 200 percent if demand warranted. But the boats were often empty, he said. The runs were unnecessary, he told superiors.
Nonetheless, he said, he was told to run empty ferries late at night to reap the maximum reimbursement.
"The captains and crews complained that they were being forced to work overtime and they're not even carrying anybody," Mr. Ward said. "We weren't helping anybody, just putting money in New York Waterway's pockets."
Mr. Ward quit last year when, he said, Waterway officials would not revise the schedule. Waterway takes a different view.
"We didn't have the latitude to make up the schedules," said Bill Bouffard, Waterway's chief financial officer. The government had decided it wanted frequent service, he said, even in the off hours, to replicate the lost PATH service.
Investigators from the antitrust division of the United States attorney's office and the Port Authority inspector general's office have interviewed Mr. Ward as well as rival ferry operators, marina owners and boat captains. The rivals have told them that Waterway chartered boats it did not need, drove up prices and prevented its rivals from expanding.
Anthony Colasanti, vice president of New York Fast Ferry, which went out of business earlier this year, said companies without subsidies could not afford the higher prices.
"We were growing," Mr. Colasanti said. "We could've kept growing. But we couldn't get boats."
In one case, a ferry operator, Seastreak, had a tentative deal this spring to lease a boat for $50,000 a month, several operators said. Suddenly it was told it could not have the boat. Waterway had agreed to pay twice the price.
Waterway officials said that the company leased the boat because it needed it, and that they did not know what the other company was offering. They denied creating a spot shortage on the market, or trying to block other companies from landing sites. They pointed to the ease with which they rounded up 34 boats last year as part of the city's contingency plan for a transit strike.
Investigators are also reviewing whether the company double-billed the government for some of its emergency ferry services, they have said. To provide the additional hours, the company augmented its own fleet with 10 chartered boats. Under its contract with the Port Authority, it was to be reimbursed for its charter costs, plus operating expenses like landing fees, insurance and crew. 
But investigators are examining whether the charter fees included some of the same operating expenses that had already been billed separately.
Waterway said the allegations of fraud are mistaken. It did not even earn a reasonable return, it said, because its reimbursement rate was cut. To its mind, the matter is nothing more than a billing dispute.

Four New Terminals
Mass transit has long been a low-margin business, and everything from the subway system to private bus lines survives on government subsidies. But more than a decade ago New York City and Port Authority officials decided it would cost too much to give operating subsidies to private ferries, too. So they decided to finance the construction of ferry terminals instead.
The four new terminals being built today are an outgrowth of that policy. All will be publicly owned, but operated by New York Waterway under contract. Two will be built next to Waterway's current docks in Weehawken and Midtown. The other two will replace the company's landings in Hoboken and at the World Financial Center. All told, more than $250 million in government money will be spent.
At two of the facilities, Waterway will pay something toward construction -- $2 million at the Midtown terminal. It will also pay the city $150,000 in annual rent, absorb the maintenance costs and kick in an escalating percentage of its ticket revenues.
The company currently charges $3 to $15 per trip, depending on the distance. The PATH train fare from New Jersey to Manhattan is $1.50.
Rival companies, which together have collected only a few million dollars in government funds, say the terminals are another unfair bonus. Waterway, whose own terminals were becoming cramped, will not have to pay to land its boats at the new ones. It will keep much of the money from terminal concessions and advertising sales. And New Jersey Transit will build a light-rail system to deliver ferry riders to the Weehawken site.
New York City officials, however, say the terminals will actually foster competition. Other operators, for example, will be able to land in Weehawken and Midtown, something they could not do while the terminals were privately owned. They will also, under the contract, be able to use Waterway's buses. The other companies will have to pay Waterway for these services.
"It's troubling that our competitor has control of a government facility and it's being left to them to set the rates that we will have to pay," said Mark Baker, chief business officer for New York Water Taxi.
City officials say New York Waterway will not be able to abuse its role.
"The lease explicitly calls for nondiscriminatory access to connecting buses and access to docking rights and terminal facilities," said Tom Cocola, a city transportation spokesman.
The city has tried before to have ferry operators share a city-owned landing, Pier 11 near Wall Street. But Waterway took to running the pier, announcing departures, distributing schedules and directing boats to landing slips. Water Taxi complained its boats were kept waiting or were not announced.
Mr. Bouffard of Waterway said no one mentioned any problems to his company. "Somebody has to be the traffic cop," he said.

Looking to the Future
Rival ferry operators say the city's administration of Pier 11 is typical of what they see as public officials' nonchalance toward regulating the ferry industry, even as it has become more lucrative.
The Port Authority does not charge Waterway anything to land its boats at public property. The company pays just $2 a year in rent, plus maintenance costs, for the right to have its moorings on public property. When the new terminals are built, the rent increases to $20 a year, plus maintenance and a share of excess profits above 8 percent.
New York City does charge to land at its piers. But the city only recently billed the companies for charges dating back to 2001. Waterway, which the city says owes $1 million, is disputing the fees.
Going forward, transportation analysts say, an expanding network of ferries will likely provide relief for crowded train lines and traffic-choked bridges. But they say the region will have to decide in the coming years whether the market is better served by a single, financially healthy operator -- to whom the government becomes increasingly wedded as its dominance extends -- or an assortment of competing rivals.
Carter Craft, program director for the Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance, which promotes greater use of ferries, is among those who say government must do more to foster meaningful competition.
"That's the only way," he said, "you will bring prices down to the point where it's not just stockbrokers riding to Wall Street."

HEADLINE: Who Is to Blame for Yamhill's Woes? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 It's all very well for Nicholas D. Kristof to wax sentimental about his hometown, Yamhill, Ore. ("Going Home, to Red Ink and Blues," column, July 19), decrying state and local cutbacks in education, health care, drug programs, criminal justice and so on. 
But blaming the cutbacks on previous overspending, the "popping of the tech bubble" and the Bush administration won't do. 
 As you reported earlier this year, in the last three decades Oregon voters have rejected more than a dozen proposals to raise taxes on income, gasoline and sales. 
It may pain Mr. Kristof, but the message from the citizens of Oregon couldn't be clearer: Given a choice -- low taxes versus high-quality education, help for the poor, drug programs and police protection -- Oregonians will choose lower taxes every time.

HEADLINE: Japan Faces Burden: Its Own Defense 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 21 

 BODY:
Not long ago, Nisohachi Hyodo, the author of a four-year plan for nuclear armament of Japan, was part of the lunatic fringe, his ideas so far from the pacifist mainstream that he was published only in obscure journals.
 These days, though, he has his own program on a major Tokyo radio station and is a popular speaker on college campuses. With everyone from the academic establishment to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi advocating that Japan become more assertive militarily, Mr. Hyodo scarcely stands out. 
 More than a half-century after two atomic blasts forced Japan's surrender in World War II, talk of acquiring nuclear weapons -- long one of the country's most sacred taboos -- is but one illustration of how Japan is grappling openly with the challenge of becoming what is known here as a "normal nation," one armed and able to fight wars. 
By no means do all Japanese support nuclear armament. But the world has changed since Japan accepted a Constitution, written by the United States during its postwar occupation, that renounces war as a tool of diplomacy. The question now is, can Japan change too?
The country's 13-year economic slump is pushing forward a host of issues -- immigration, the role of women, a steep decline in population -- that are testing whether this tradition-bound society will adapt or face inevitable decline.
No issue is likely to have a greater impact on the region than how Japan takes up the burden of its defense after a 20th-century past that traumatized it and its neighbors.
During its long postwar boom, Japan's security rested on two pillars: the protection of the United States, which still bases 47,000 troops here, and pockets so deep that it could buy its way out of almost any unpleasant situation. Today both elements are subject to nagging doubts.
"We are becoming much more realistic about defense matters, and the reason for this is our economic stagnation," said Koji Murata, an expert in international relations at Doshisha University. "In the past we could depend on our overwhelming economic strength as a sort of cushion. Generally speaking, Japanese are beginning to feel that this margin is getting smaller and smaller."
For the first time in three generations a shift in public opinion has rendered ordinary the discussion of a more assertive Japan and left defenders of the "peace Constitution" on the defensive.
While China's expanding power is a growing concern, the most immediate spur for this change has been a year of starkly increased tensions with North Korea, which already possesses ballistic missiles and is pursuing nuclear weapons. 
In March, Mr. Koizumi's defense minister, Shigeru Ishiba, told a parliamentary committee that if North Korea started fueling its missiles, "then it is time to strike."
But even if Japanese are more comfortable with such assertiveness, their neighbors may not be. Many continue to harbor suspicion of a country that they feel has yet fully to acknowledge the damage done by its militarization last century, or to atone for its colonial past. Relations with China have been strained for two years by Mr. Koizumi's repeated visits to a controversial shrine to Japan's war veterans, including 14 people judged as Class A war criminals.
When Mr. Koizumi reasserted last month that he would continue his visits, in what has become a summer ritual, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, warned, "Without a correct view on history, there is no guarantee to healthy and stable ties between China and Japan."
During the same time, there have been no visits between leaders of the countries, and China has watched the move toward a more muscular Japan with concern. While it is unclear precisely how much China spends on defense, Japan spent $47 billion on defense in 2002, according to the Center for Defense Information. 
By almost any ranking China and Japan are among the world's top five military budgets, and some analysts warn of the dangers of an unmediated military competition in the region, which could include the unpredictable North Korea.
For a long time the United States served as a buffer in the region by providing for Japan's defense. But many say that this relationship cannot last forever and that Japan's neighbors, like the Japanese themselves, may have little choice but to accept the inevitability of a bulkier Japanese military presence.
In an era of weapons that can project power over vast distances, and with pressing security commitments elsewhere after Sept. 11, 2001, America may simply tire of shouldering the defense burden here, many Japanese analysts fear. 
Indeed, some are already drawing that conclusion from a recent decision to reduce the presence and profile of the 37,000 United States troops in neighboring South Korea.
At the same time, Japan's economic problems have begun to reveal the limits of an approach to foreign policy that critics here call "happo bijin," or the "eight-faced beauty," strategy, under which the country showers its wealth around the globe, hoping to win the good will of all.
In the Persian Gulf war of 1991, instead of sending troops, which it said its Constitution barred, this oil-dependent country spent $13 billion to placate the United States, Kuwait and the other victorious allies.
But diplomats and foreign policy experts say that heyday as a donor and practitioner of checkbook diplomacy is past. In the past year, Japan has quietly relinquished to the United States its place as the world's top international aid donor. Its aid budget has been slashed by 10 percent. Public debt has soared to 140 percent of gross domestic product. Opposition to handouts is growing.
"For years I have been saying that nuclear armament is an inexpensive solution," said Mr. Hyodo, a former member of the country's armed forces, officially called the Self-Defense Forces. "We should take the example of France, which has a minimal nuclear deterrent force. This allows them to spend far less on defense than Japan, while remaining safe from attack." 
That may not necessarily be so. For Japan, building up a military may ultimately prove more costly than handing out money, supporting the United Nations lavishly and underwriting American military moves. 
But arguments like Mr. Hyodo's may prove persuasive nonetheless. The difference, analysts say, is that the extra spending will leave Japan with something tangible -- military hardware -- and that this may at least create a feeling of greater security, which in politics is everything. Sucha shift would also buy jobs as Japan expands the large quasi-defense industry that already exists here.
Groups within the governing Liberal Democratic Party have yearned for Japan's return to a "normal," militarized status since the 1950's. Today the signs of the change in thinking abound.
Prime Minister Koizumi has urged the abandonment of the peaceful-sounding name, the Self-Defense Forces, which allows Japanese to pretend, as their Constitution demands, that that they have no army, though they have 240,000 forces engaged in national defense, according to Armed Forces of the World.
Mr. Koizumi would prefer for them to be known simply as armed forces, and for two years he has been pushing aggressively to expand their role. That began with support in the Indian Ocean for United States operations in Afghanistan, the first time Japan's naval forces have deployed so far away. In recent weeks Mr. Koizumi's government has upped the ante, offering to send troops to Iraq and arguing for a relaxation of restraints on how they could be armed.
Throughout the postwar period, the joke about Japan's foreign policy was that it did not have one, instead following ritually in the wake of the United States. 
Now Mr. Koizumi is pushing for the creation of a national security council, to be drawn up along American lines, bolstering the country's diplomacy and giving the defense and security bureaucracies far more access to the prime minister's ear.
Those legal and statutory changes are being matched in the country's armory. Although Japan's richly financed military forces boast some of the world's most sophisticated hardware -- weapons systems like the Aegis destroyer and F-15 fighter jets -- their actual configuration, as well as training for their use, has been overwhelmingly defensive.
That, too, is changing abruptly. The country is acquiring in-air refueling capacity for its fighter force, as well as developing a sophisticated air support ship -- part destroyer, part helicopter carrier -- that news reports say is intended to allow operations near the Korean Peninsula.
Such changes have increasing political and popular support. During a vote this spring on a series of national emergency laws, which greatly expand the government's ability to deploy the Self-Defense Forces, even the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, lined up in support of the bill.
Advocates of continued pacifism complain that the government has carefully exploited the tensions with North Korea to heighten fear among voters.
The Japanese public, some of them warn, is being dragged unawares into a revival of militarism.
"I cannot conceive of a war in which North Korea, a far smaller, far poorer country, attacks Japan first," said Ryuichi Ozawa, a professor of constitutional studies at Shizuoka University.
"The point here is that there is no confidence that the people of Japan and their government can control a military," he said. "This is a contemporary concern, and not just an issue of our past history."
But public opinion is turning against such sentiments. "Whenever there is any talk about the security needs of Japan, people say we are reverting to militarism," said Tetsu Takahashi, 20, a university student. "I don't necessarily support nuclear weapons, even if we can't rule them out. Whatever the case, our policies have been too meek."

HEADLINE: Crimes Outside the World's Jurisdiction 

BYLINE:  By David B. Rivkin Jr. and Lee A. Casey; David B. Rivkin Jr. and Lee A. Casey are lawyers who served in the Justice Department during the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A crusading Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, has been winning praise from human rights groups for trying to prosecute members of the military juntas that ruled, and terrorized, South America in the 1970's. In 1998, he tried to extradite Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator; last month he got custody of a former navy lieutenant accused of genocide and terrorism in Argentina.
 The praise isn't surprising: prosecuting people who are apparently escaping punishment for horrible crimes seems fundamentally sound. The problem is that efforts by Judge Garzon, and others, are based on a legal doctrine that has worrisome implications. That doctrine is "universal jurisdiction," under which every state is entitled to prosecute and punish the officials of every other state for "international" offenses. It is a principle that even its most active international practitioner, Belgium, is wisely starting to reject: the governing party plans to amend a law under which activists tried to prosecute George H. W. Bush, Gen. Tommy Franks and Prime Minister Tony Blair for human rights offenses in connection with the wars against Iraq, even though nobody involved is Belgian. 
 By contrast to those named in the Belgian cases, the man whom Judge Garzon has jailed, Ricardo Miguel Cavallo, doubtless richly deserves prosecution. Mr. Cavallo is accused of kidnapping, torturing and murdering hundreds of people during the "dirty war" in Argentina from 1976 to 1983. Under Argentina's amnesty laws, however, Mr. Cavallo cannot be punished; he was extradited to Spain not by Argentina, but by Mexico, where he was living. Judge Garzon is essentially ignoring Argentina's own history and desires.
Universal jurisdiction does have a proper place in international law. It began as a device to fight piracy and slave trading, offenses that took place on the high seas, beyond the boundaries of any individual state. In more recent years, however, universality has been asserted for an increasing number of human rights offenses, even though there is little practice (in the form of actual prosecutions that are accepted as legal by the defendant's own country) to support these claims. Without such a body of consistent and accepted practice, universal jurisdiction remains an academic aspiration rather than an established fact, and rightly so.
If international law really did permit each state to prosecute the leaders of all others, based on its own interpretation of international law, this would prompt a new kind of war, one fought in courtrooms around the globe. Courts, however, are poor instruments of international policy, and such a result would make normal international relations impossible. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld recently said, for instance, with respect to the claims brought against American officials in Belgium, that if United States officials cannot travel to Brussels without the fear of politically motivated prosecution, then the United States would take its business (i.e., NATO headquarters) elsewhere.
In addition, when compared with criminal enforcement in national legal systems, international prosecutions are always second best. This is because all prosecutions are meant to accomplish at least two goals. The first is to punish the guilty. The second is to promote socially desirable results in the form of deterrence and an overall respect for the rule of law. In instances where the cases grow out of national traumas, such as civil war or repression, the reassurance of the citizenry, political reconciliation and a kind of national catharsis are also critical elements.
 I nternational prosecutions can achieve the first goal, punishing the guilty, but they are singularly ill-equipped to deliver on the others (a flaw shared by the International Criminal Court). Reconciliation and respect for law can be taught; they cannot be dictated. This is especially the case when such "international" prosecutions are undertaken by foreign judicial systems, with little or no connection to the perpetrators, victims or offenses, under the rubric of universal jurisdiction. Such proceedings are invariably decoupled from the political, social and economic context of the affected country, and may well be based on the political or foreign policy agenda of the prosecuting state. For all of these reasons, national prosecutions should remain the primary means of doing justice. Where they have failed, the focus should be on reforming the national system from within.
In Mr. Cavallo's case, Argentina did not fail. Rather, it made the difficult and distasteful choice to give immunity to many of the people who had terrorized the country during military rule. In return, Argentina made a peaceful return to civilian government and democracy, and avoided further military coups.
It is neither the right nor the place of the Spanish judiciary to deny the validity of Argentina's laws, any more than it is, say, Britain's right to correct perceived deficiencies in the American judicial system. Argentina is no longer a colony. It made a choice. Perhaps it chose badly. Perhaps it paid too high a price for democracy. (In fact, Argentina's new president, Nestor Kirchner, is seeking to have these amnesty laws overturned.) That, however, is for Argentina, not Judge Garzon or anybody else, to decide.

HEADLINE: Politics and Economics Join in University Crisis 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

DATELINE: AMHERST, Mass. 

 BODY:
For months the faculty here at the flagship campus of the University of Massachusetts system has watched the spectacle of its president being questioned by Congress and battling efforts by Gov. Mitt Romney to force him out of office.
 But while lawmakers sought to learn about William M. Bulger's fugitive brother, a onetime F.B.I. informant now on its Most Wanted List, and the governor has accused Mr. Bulger of harming the university's reputation, a number of professors here say they have a different concern: that his political troubles are overshadowing what is happening at their university. 
 "We are the collateral damage in the battle over Billy Bulger," said Max Page, an associate professor of architecture and history, adding that the disputes had "distracted attention" from the budget cuts faced by the university. 
Mr. Bulger declined to be interviewed about his stewardship. But his supporters, including the university's board of trustees, many alumni and some legislators, say that he has greatly increased private giving to the University of Massachusetts, and helped ward off even steeper cuts during the first two years of the state budget crisis, in 2001 and 2002.
"The facts clearly indicate that by any objective measure, the quality of our students, our fund-raising and research have all increased dramatically during the past several years," Grace Fey, the chairwoman of the board of trustees, said in a written statement.
Still, the budget problems are inescapable. Over the past three years, as the state's economy has slumped and its budget problems multiplied, the Amherst campus's budget has been cut 29 percent by the State Legislature.
Other state universities have also been hit by budget problems. But Will Doyle, a senior policy analyst with the Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, in San Jose, Calif., says the cuts in Massachusetts may be the largest absorbed by any state university before the year is over.
At the same time, the university has raised its annual fees, or tuition, by a proposed $2,500, to $13,730 for students from the state, the biggest increase of any state university during the past two years, Mr. Doyle said. The number of full-time faculty members has dropped by 25 percent.
Traditionally, the university's budget was largely dependent on the State Legislature and governor. And, professors note, when Mr. Bulger, the longtime president of the Massachusetts Senate, was originally picked for his post seven years ago his backers said he would bring his political clout to fund-raising.
State Senator Stan Rosenberg, who represents Amherst and who is a graduate of the Amherst campus, drew a distinction between Mr. Bulger's performance in the first years of the state's budget crisis and the past few months.
"Going into this period, the performance of President Bulger was very dramatic in a whole range of areas," Mr. Rosenberg said. "He raised money for a lot of endowed professorships, he attracted students with higher SAT scores and he increased alumni giving," said Mr. Rosenberg, a Democrat, like Mr. Bulger.
"Now the state is facing a $3 billion deficit, and Gov. Romney has changed the political dynamic by making President Bulger the issue, and he is having a terrible year," Mr. Rosenberg said.
Mr. Romney, a Republican, won the governorship last November and soon began calling for a sweeping reorganization of the University of Massachusetts system, including the elimination of the president's office, which oversees all campuses. The Legislature rejected the plan, which Mr. Romney had said was designed to save money, not as a personal attack on Mr. Bulger. 
John Lombardi, the chancellor the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, is candid about the problems at his campus though optimistic about the future.
"The budget is terrible, the Legislature has not been kind," Mr. Lombardi said. "There is no question that the number of full-time faculty is down. And the professors are right to complain about their salaries." The salaries have not been increased in three years despite raises and cost-of-living increases guaranteed by the state.
But Mr. Lombardi said what the professors do not see is the money Mr. Bulger has raised privately, as well as a $328 million program approved by the Legislature for construction of buildings, like a heating plant and science center, and widespread repair of older structures.
"President Bulger is a celebrity, and as a celebrity he provides access to people of means," Mr. Lombardi said.
Last year, for example, the university raised $98 million from private donors, about half of it going to the Amherst campus, compared with only $34 million in 1996. Some of this money will go for endowed chairs, Mr. Lombardi said, "but most professors won't see it themselves, because faculty salaries are the state's responsibility."
Robert Connolly, a spokesman for Mr. Bulger, said that as a result of Mr. Bulger's efforts, "the university has more money to spend" now than it did when he took over.
Some of the problems the professors complain about, like cracks in the walls or exposed asbestos, Mr. Connolly said, date to decades of neglect by the Legislature.
Mr. Romney has little direct power to remove Mr. Bulger since the president is appointed by the 19 trustees who serve fixed terms and who have continued to back him. 
But Mr. Romney has said he will continue his effort and will name new trustees until he has enough allies to remove Mr. Bulger.
Professors say that means the strife will continue. "Billy Bulger is now a liability to the university, because all anyone wants to talk about when they talk about UMass is Billy Bulger," said Dan Clawson, a professor of sociology and president of the faculty union. "Noone is interested in whether the university will survive."
As the maneuvering goes on, the university has grappled with its cuts. Among the measures taken to cope with the reduced state aid are an end to state money for the university press and the university's adult education program, reductions in library hours and the merger of some academic departments.
For example, there is a proposal to merge most of the foreign language departments, so that French, Spanish, German, Latin, Greek, Chinese and Japanese would all be taught in one department.
"The administrators say they are using a corporate model, merging and downsizing to save money," said Eve Weinbaum, an assistant professor of labor studies.
In practice, this makes for hardships, she said. Because the labor studies department lost one of its four professors, it can no longer offer all the courses students need to complete their degrees.
For Ms. Weinbaum, there is a further peril. Last February she was approved for tenure by a faculty committee, but, according to the chairman of her department, Tom Juravich, the final decision rests with the provost and has been held up by the budgetary uncertainty.
The university's budget woes are painfully clear in the tiny, dilapidated office of Richard Burt, a professor of English who is moving to a new job at the University of Florida. All his books have been packed, exposing cracks in the bare cinder-block walls.
Professor Burt says he is tired of operating for periods of time without a phone, or sometimes even without mail service. He speaks of not having money to attend academic conferences, of not getting a raise for the last three years, and of watching the size of the English department drop to 36, down from 47 in 1996.
So Mr. Burt is moving on. At his new job, he says, he will get a 60 percent increase in salary and a lighter teaching load. "I feel like a character in an action movie," he said, "that runs out of a building just before it blows up."

HEADLINE: Apartments Planned Downtown For Moderate-Income Families 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
More than 300 units of housing for moderate-income families will be created in Lower Manhattan using $50 million of the $21 billion of federal money promised to New York after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, officials said yesterday.
 About two-thirds of the $50 million is expected to come from surplus funds in a residential grant program intended to attract new residents to downtown neighborhoods, rebuilding officials said. That program was administered by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which will also contribute the balance of the money from its general fund. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that the new initiative was intended to help provide housing for "moderate- and middle-income New Yorkers,the real social glue of our communities." The apartments will be available to families with incomes of about $50,000 to $85,000.
The $50 million will be used for subsidies tied to the Liberty Bond program, the federal program that offers low-cost financing for developers to construct rental housing in Lower Manhattan. Twenty percent of the units developed in the next four projects approved under the program will be set aside for moderate-income families, the officials said.
The subsidies allow the developers to charge lower rents for those apartments set aside for families with incomes at the given levels. More than 1,300 units have been approved under Liberty Bond programs, and applications for more than 6,000 units are being planned, the officials said.
Mel Martinez, the secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, who joined Mr. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki in the announcement, said the initiative "is going to provide a place for the teachers, the firefighters, the people who make a community tick to be able to live where they work."
As part of his plan for redeveloping Lower Manhattan, Mr. Bloomberg has said that the city hoped to provide subsidies to build as many as 2,000 new apartments downtown over the next 10 years that are affordable to middle-income residents.
Daniel E. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, said that to achieve that goal, "we're going to require additional funds."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: IDEOLOGY; 
In Search for Baath Loyalists, U.S. Finds Itself in Gray Area

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
Ahmad Saleh al-Wan says he languished for 15 years in an Iranian prison, a foot soldier in Iraq's unwinnable war against its neighbor. When he came home in 1997, his eyesight ruined, Saddam Hussein gave him his reward: he was made a "group" member in the Baath Arab Socialist Party, the vehicle for Mr. Hussein's rise to power and his grip on it. An honor, the rank more importantly meant higher pay for Mr. Wan in his job at a government printing plant. 
 But six years later, Mr. Hussein is gone, the Americans are here, and the reward that was meant to ease Mr. Wan's life has, he says, ruined it. 
 Under a policy to "de-Baathify" Iraq imposed in May by L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator, all public employees with the rank of group or above in the party have lost their jobs. Like many of his former colleagues, Mr. Wan, 51, is applying for an exemption. But for now, he says he has no way to support his five children. Gaunt and unkempt, he comes to the printing plant and hangs about like a ghost. 
The policy is one piece of the effort under way here to "extirpate" -- the word of Mr. Bremer's choosing -- the remnants of the old government, and rid Iraq of an ideology that was born long before Mr. Hussein's rule but became inextricably intertwined with it. Mr. Hussein took over the party in the 1960's and rode its slogan of "One Arab Nation With an Eternal Message" and its principles of unity, freedom and socialism, for more than three decades.
Much like the Nazi Party, and the Communist parties of Eastern Europe, the Baath Party came to play a central role in disseminating propaganda, stifling dissent, and ensuring that neighbors and colleagues policed each other's behavior, speech and thought.
The effort to "de-Baathify" Iraq mirrors efforts in postwar Germany and Japan and the post-Communist Soviet bloc. It is seen as the first step in building a new, democratic culture here, and undoing the legacy of 30 years of authoritarian rule. But like all principles, this one is easier to pronounce than apply.
Not all of the people affected are as sympathetic as Mr. Wan. There are plenty like Ibrahim al-Najim, 55, a university administrator and unrepentant Baathist who conceded passing reports about people up the party chain but said he could not be held accountable for how the security services used the information. Even now, his greatest regret about Mr. Hussein's rule is not gross violations of human rights but his betrayal of the party's pan-Arabic ideology by the invasion of Kuwait.
But many people, probably most, fall in between as those who went along to get along, who did not believe but did not defy. "I'm one of the ones with clean hands," said Fawzia Habib Hassan, a school principal and ranking party member who is nowout of work.
Some worry that the current approach may sweep up some whose complicity was only nominal -- and leave many of the guilty untouched. Low-level members could have given the word that sent someone to prison as easily as higher-ranking ones, even non-Baathists say.

Hints and Accusations
The Baathists also overlapped with and worked closely with the vast security apparatus, which has been dissolved but not brought to account. Some Baathists accrued wealth or property, sometimes taken from their victims, that could give them a leg up in a new free-market economy. All of this will have to be sorted out for some sense of justice to prevail in the new Iraq, a process that may take years. 
At the Association of Freed Prisoners in Baghdad, where volunteers have amassed millions of government and party files, they are finding that the identities of many of those who gave orders for executions and the like were masked by code names or numbers.
But the association is also closely guarding any information about perpetrators until a new justice system is in place. "We do not want to start trouble within Iraqi society," said the association's administrator, Nasir Jasim Lazeem al-Khrawi, 43. 
In the meantime, millions of minds shaped by the party's culture of eliminating choice and smothering initiative will have to be retooled.
That culture is well documented in fat notebooks that fill a maze of lightless rooms beneath the Baath Party's National Command headquarters in Baghdad. Much of the bureaucracy recorded here is banal: Iraqis informing on one another and then the reports moving up the party chain of command in a voluminous, handwritten paper trail.
The party had at least 1.2 million members of a total population of about 24 million, and it had many more supporters, but ultimately only one member counted. The files include letters appealing directly to Mr. Hussein.
A dismissed Baath Party member from Basra wrote to him in desperation, "The accusation I have connections to Iranians is false."
The recruiting plan for a southern district includes this thought: "Show the importance of the leadership of Saddam Hussein to lead the Baath Party, the country, and oppose the aggressions of the Americans and Zionists on our country."
The plan further suggests training all Baath Party members in light and heavy weapons, and "creating a deeper understanding of the democratic concepts of the Baath Party in this society."
Over time, party membership became a prerequisite for most chances at higher education and many promotions in the public and even private sector. There were other sources of power in Iraq, including those linked to Mr. Hussein by tribe or birth, but the party held its own until the end. 
One March 2002 decree in the Baath files orders that students applying for advanced degrees meet the party's security and intellectual requirements. Such decrees constitute the defense of those who say they are being unfairly punished for trying to survive and succeed in a system that showed no sign of ending.
"I'm sure Mr. Bremer and the new administration will understand this was our duty," said Hyam Sabri, 38, the principal at El Najat Secondary School for girls in eastern Baghdad. "We had to be Baathists." She said she joined the party at the age of 12 because she knew even then that she wanted to teach. In 1997 she became a group member, which means that she has now lost her job.

Defining Duty
Mr. Bremer and his aides bring a different understanding to the Baathists. Scott Carpenter, a deputy assistant secretary of state whose portfolio in Iraq includes weeding out senior Baathists, argues that the process should be the administration's "No. 1 priority," even if it slows the revival of government services.
"Unless you scrub hard," Mr. Carpenter said in an interview, "you can't create the seedbed" for a new society. For now, he said, the occupation should "cut very deeply." Over time the Iraqis may create, as the Allies and the Germans did with many Nazis after World War II, a mechanism to rehabilitate former Baathists.
In Iraq, Americans are relying more on the model set by the purging processes throughout Eastern Europe after the fall of Communism. Mr. Carpenter spent time there, and said that in some countries the Communists simply capitalized on the assets and networks they had amassed while in power to reinvent themselves.
He has little sympathy for those who say they had no choice but to rise in the Baath Party. 
"There was also somebody who said no," Mr. Carpenter said. "It represents that fundamental human choice."
From the view of the American soldiers charged with putting the policy in place, things are less black and white. To the chagrin of the civilian administration, some commanders have tried to use Baathists with skills and experience to get government services running again. Other commanders complain that excluding so many people from the building of a new society is creating an army of disenchanted people.
And many soldiers are finding that, up close, nuance crowds in. "It's kind of dicey -- who was just toeing the line, doing what they had to do, and those ideologues," said Lt. Louis Morelli, 26, of the First Armored Division, who is based at Baghdad University. "There's a gray area." His unit has been besieged with anonymous tips and letters complaining about Baathists still in their jobs. They must sort through it all, weeding out the personal grievances.
The unit also wants to save a man it has fired, Hamid al-Muhammad, 36, a champion high-jumper. "I've got kind of an attachment to him," said First Lt. Mike Messner, 25. 
Mr. Muhammad willingly concedes that he joined the party in 1991, but said that was only because he wanted to finish his higher education. "It was a choice -- you step backward to guarantee two steps forward," he said. His two brothers chose not to become members, and they never found jobs.
Mr. Muhammad earned a doctorate and worked as a physical trainer and extracurricular activity coordinator at Saddam University. In 2001, he became a group member in the party -- at students' insistence, he said. Now he is unemployed, with a pregnant wife and severely disabled daughter. He has no skill essential to the allies or the Iraqi people, as the exemption application demands. It comes down to this, Lieutenant Morelli said: "good character, good values."

Exceptions to a Rule
That probably will not be enough. Even the president of Saddam University -- now renamed Nahrain University -- faces an uphill battle in trying to rehire the 25 professors he has lost of 260. Many are highly trained specialists.
The president, Dr. Mahmoud Hayawi Hamash al-Tikriti, has dutifully made the case for his fired professors, but he holds out little hope. Saddam University was founded in 1993 to provide the best in scientific and professional education, so originally its officials were allowed to hire on merit. But in the past several years, Dr. Hamash said, he faced increasing pressure to "Baathify" the university. He could appeal to hire a non-Baathist, but exceptions were rare.
Now he finds himself appealing for exceptions to keep Baathists. "This is a mirror image," he said with a smile.
Dr. Hamash still has his job because he left the Baath Party in 1964, a year after joining. He conceded, though, that he cooperated with security agencies and party officials to screen applicants for higher education and jobs at the university -- the files at the National Command are full of correspondence with him -- and said he never took a stance that would have put him in danger or into exile.
He criticized privately -- and publicly sent Saddam Hussein congratulatory telegrams. "Before the war, we used to say, 'If he weren't a dictator and a murderer, he would be all right,' " he said.
One challenge for the Americans is that many Iraqis still support Baathist principles as the best to uplift and modernize Iraq. Others have been shaped by three decades of propaganda delivered through state news media and party seminars.
"We didn't become members of this party for Saddam's sake," said Nassir Muhammad, 22, a political science student. "We found in this party and its aims, and what it wishes for, things we liked," particularly Arab nationalism. He hopes to go into academia, he said, to create a generation that understands that the "occupying Americans and international Zionism" are the real enemy.
Having been raised to please the powerful, others are simply transferring blind obedience to the new powers -- the Americans in some areas, hard-line Islamic groups in others. For example, Ms. Sabri, the school principal, has allowed hard-line Shiite groups to put posters of clerics in her school -- next to the Hussein-era militaristic murals -- and says she would adopt an Islamic curriculum, despite Iraq's secular character, if told to do so.

Hearts and Minds
No policy can instantly remove Baathist elements from minds. Nor can any decree wipe out overnight the fear that the party created, as suggests the situation at the printing plant where Mr. Wan, the former prisoner of war, worked.
The plant caught the eye of Lt. Col. James Danna of the First Armored Division when its employees refused to sign a form, given to all government employees, renouncing their membership in and allegiance to the Baath Party. "They're really being defiant," he said.
Hussein Abbas, 35, said neither he, nor the 650 people he managed, nor the director general he worked for, had signed the form. "What's the use of this paper?" he asked.
It seemed to be intransigence for its own sake. But in the dim office of the director general, with the door closed, curtains drawn and anonymity guaranteed, things became clearer. In truth, the director general said, he had signed the form, and he believed that all of his employees had too. Officials with the American-led civilian administration knew this, he said, even if the American military did not.
But no one would ever publicly admit signing the form, he said. They were too frightened of vengeful Baathists.
"I cannot provide 19,000 people with security," he said.
One of his colleagues had recently received a note threatening death if he continued working with the Americans. The director general had begun driving his car himself because he no longer trusted his driver. 
"We can't tell our friends from our enemies," he said in a low voice. "You cannot even trust your own children."

HEADLINE: SOCCER; 
Manchester United Tour: For Fun, Mostly for Profit

BYLINE:  By JAMIE TRECKER

 BODY:
Manchester United's barnstorming tour of the United States, beginning with a match against Glasgow Celtic of Scotland tonight in Seattle, includes games featuring some of the most recognizable club teams in the world. 
 "This is a key part of our preseason," Manchester United's chief executive, Peter Kenyon, said of the tour. "What we want to do is promote soccer. We are bringing our first team, and we will not disappoint." 
 Organizers are close to selling out the tour's four games; 300,000 tickets have been sold and only the match in Los Angeles on Sunday, against Club America of Mexico, has tickets available. United will play at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., on July 31 against Juventus of Italy and concludes its tour in Philadelphia at the new Lincoln Financial Field on Aug. 3 against Barcelona of Spain. 
Tickets to see Celtic and Manchester United play sold out within an hour of going on sale several months ago. And, despite the loss of the team's most recognizable player -- David Beckham -- to the Spanish club Real Madrid, a glance at the Internet auction site eBay shows that the resale of tickets for the tour are doing a brisk business. 
Manchester United, which has a marketing alliance with YankeeNets, is eager to capitalize on a lucrative and as yet untapped United States market. Flush from successful forays into Asia, Manchester United thinks the time is right to mine the United States. 
 "We do think there's a good football following" in the United States, Kenyon said recently. "We know from our fan base that there is a demand for football -- the success the U.S.A. has in the World Cup was a great boost and a very important factor." 
And Manchester United, the champion of the English Premier League, does need the new markets. Ninety-five percent of its revenue -- reported at $231 million last season -- comes from Britain. Although English soccer clubs are among the richest and most visible in the world, competition from Italian, French and Spanish leagues for players have contributed to the type of wage inflation bedeviling sports in the United States. 
Coming to the United States, the club hopes to open a new market.

HEADLINE: Time Was, Farmers Prayed for Rain 

BYLINE:  By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
TED BLEW, who owns Oak Grove Plantation in Hunterdon County, N.J., with his wife, Susan Blew, did not mince words. "This is the worst year in 45 years," he said. "There was a tough, cold winter. Then the rain started and didn't stop for a month. Everything now is two to three weeks late." Most of his income comes from selling his tomatoes, peppers, squash and melons at New York City's Greenmarkets, and he estimates that he'll lose 55 percent of it.
 His litany continued. Greenhouse costs have tripled because of the cold and a rise in fuel prices; he had to replant some fields because of the rain, and simply abandoned planting others. "Once the pestilence sets in, it doesn't give up," he said. 
 For shoppers in the Northeast who welcome fresh local summer produce, the weather has resulted in delays of one to three weeks for most crops, starting with strawberries and including corn, tomatoes and peaches. And depending on the farm, some items, like berries and squash, may be in short supply. But many farmers, Mr. Blew included, have been wary of raising prices because of the economy.
Last week, the New Jersey Farm Bureau reported "growing-condition troubles brought on by weather extremes for most farmers in the state." The report said moisture and humidity were helping insects thrive, but making weed killers less effective. Many farmers complained that muddy fields made planting difficult to impossible.
It was no better in other parts of the region. "Yields are off anywhere from 10 to 50 percent," said Dale Moyer, the agricultural program director on Long Island for Cornell Cooperative Extension in Riverhead, N.Y. "And early-season lettuces were off as much as 75 percent because of the rain."
In a normal year, the local sweet-corn season begins around July 4. This year, it did not start until last week at many Greenmarket stands, including the one in Union Square run by Sycamore Farms of Middletown, N.Y. And the available ears were not as large as usual because they came from the very first plantings, always smaller and ordinarily brought to market before now.
And unlike the prices of most other crops, the cost of corn has gone up at many stands, from three for $1 last year to five ears for $2. Some stands are charging $5 a dozen. "That's one thing you can't blame on the weather," said Henry Smith, who owns Sycamore Farms. "We haven't increased the price in eight or nine years, and we're due for a raise. All our costs have gone up."
At Wickham's Fruit Farm in Cutchogue, N.Y., on the North Fork of Long Island, the raspberries, peaches, apricots and nectarines are ripening well. But the harvest is reduced, so few if any customers will be able to pick their own. "It's going to be frustrating for the consumer because of the lower yields," said Prudence Wickham Heston, an owner. Even when it was not raining or cold, the sky has tended to be overcast, she said, noting that the fruit needs sun to develop good flavor.
The weather was particularly unkind to the farm's strawberries. The sudden cold in December did not give the plants, which were put in the ground last fall, a chance to adjust gradually to winter, and then the spring brought rain but no sun. "It was a triple whammy," Ms. Heston said. "The bottom line is that we lost our entire strawberry crop."
The tribulations have not been evenly spread, however. The Green Thumb, an organic farm in Water Mill, N.Y., on the South Fork, had a fine strawberry season because its plantings were more sheltered. The cooler weather was also good for lettuce and herbs. But the farm lost its entire zucchini crop. "It was pretty devastating," said Jo Halsey, an owner. 
Christian Wolffer, the owner of Wolffer Estates winery in Sagaponack, also on Long Island's South Fork, said that at first the season looked as if it would be a disaster because of the lack of sun. "It's better now, and it could be all right, but we certainly do not need more rain," he said.
On the North Fork, Kip Bedell, the winemaker at Bedell Cellars and Corey Creek wineries, said the season is a week or so late.
"That's not so bad," he said. "Only time will tell. Farming is like that."

HEADLINE: Dealer Car Loans 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"California Takes Aim at Dealer Bias in Car Loans" (news article, July 16) questions the practice by which dealers are compensated for helping consumers obtain auto financing. 
The dealer markup reflects a legitimate retail fee for a service rendered. 
 Earlier this month, the California Court of Appeal ruled that this practice was not unlawful, unfair or fraudulent. It cited a trial court decision in a similar case: "Market forces, competition and the dealer's own long-term interest in maintaining a customer base, impose important constraints on the contract sell rate. . . . If the dealer quotes too high a contract price or interest rate, the car buyer is likely to find a better deal from another car dealer and/or seek financing from direct lenders willing to make a direct loan at a lower interest rate." 
 Dealer-assisted financing makes financing available to many consumers who otherwise might not be able to obtain it.

HEADLINE: The True Flavors of Mexico, Hidden in New York 

BYLINE:  By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
THE grocery Hidalgo Mexican Food Products looks as if it could as easily be in a courtyard in Cuernavaca as on a nondescript block in Astoria, Queens. The shelves are lined with avocado leaves and chilies. Small bags of dried herbs share the aisles with cans of beans, sacks of tortillas and racy comic books in Spanish. Bundles of fresh epazote leaves are stacked next to a cash register.
 But sidestep a mop and bucket blocking one aisle and walk to the south end of the store, and a neat little counter with a handful of stools reveals itself. Behind the counter is a stove where a short woman in a tank top is tending a pot. She looks up with welcoming eyes. "Hola," she says as you take a seat and inhale the warm, homey aromas of steamed corn and sauteed pork. 
 The taqueria within Hidalgo is one of many hidden in the small groceries and shops that dot the city's scattered Mexican neighborhoods. Part lunch counter, part family dining room, these taquerias, serving mostly antojitos, or little street delicacies, have become an essential component of Mexican culture in New York City. 
Not so long ago, any kind of taqueria was unheard of in New York. The city's Mexican population in 1980 was barely 24,000, according to the City Planning Department. But by 2000, that population had shot to about 187,000, primarily in the Queens neighborhoods of Elmhurst, Corona, Jackson Heights and Astoria; Sunset Park in Brooklyn; and East Harlem. It has spread farther since.
In the East Village, the Zaragoza Mexican Deli and Grocery, a cramped bodega with barely enough room to turn around between a cash register and a crate of fresh cactus paddles, offers a small selection of tamales and tacos each day, with a more elaborate selection on the weekends. A three-seat counter is squeezed in next to a jukebox, along with a pile of napkins on a paper plate, toothpicks and a bottle of salt.
At the Tehuitzingo Deli and Grocery in Clinton, the taqueria in the rear is far more spacious, complete with a blackboard menu, a small kitchen, a counter laminated with a sea creature design and enough fake flowers to hold a fake funeral. At Las Conchitas in Sunset Park, the taqueria is in the rear of a bakery, just a few simple tables and stools behind trays and trays of garish pastries in iridescent colors.
The quality of Mexican food in New York has improved markedly in the last few years, with restaurants as elaborate as Pampano, Rocking Horse and Salon Mexico showcasing the complexity and diversity of high-end Mexican cuisine. Yet the heart of immigrant Mexican culture beats within these rude and humble taquerias, where two soft corn tortillas, doubled and folded around carnitas or barbacoa -- braised pork chunks or stewed goat -- can for a moment soothe an ache for home. 
These taquerias are decidedly modest. Paper plates are typical, and if you haven't mastered the important skill of grasping a taco and taking a bite without squeezing out the filling, the fork you receive will be plastic.
You have as much chance of seeing a margarita as a bottle of Chateau Petrus. The drinks include beer or excellent Mexican sodas made by Jarritos, which uses cane sugar instead of the American corn syrup, giving the soda a clean, crisp taste in tangy flavors like grapefruit and tamarind. Occasionally you'll be offered a glass of house-made aguas frescas, lightly sweet water-based beverages in flavors like mango or strawberry. Hidalgo serves a wonderful agua fresca made with hibiscus, like the Jamaican sorrel drink, and called, fittingly enough, Jamaica (pronounced hah-MY-ka).
The flavors and aromas may evoke nostalgia, but oddly enough the institution of the grocery-taqueria is practically unknown in Mexico. "No, never," said Barbara Sibley, an owner of La Palapa, a Mexican restaurant in the East Village, who grew up in Mexico City. "Stores are stores. You'll more often see a person on the corner, selling their special gorditas, or a certain kind of flauta or quesadilla."
Apparently the grocery-taqueria is a New York adaptation, perhaps inspired by the little groceries and delis in New York that double as sandwich shops. Or possibly it's a question of economy.
"Maybe it's because they have lots of labor -- the whole family -- but not much capital, so they want to get dual use of the stores they rent," said Paul Berman, an author and critic who has spent a lot of time in Mexico. "But mostly I guess it's because cuisine is a big aspect of Mexican culture, and to set up some kind of kitchen seems the logical thing to do for any Mexican."
Any immigrant culture, of course, tries to reproduce aspects of its homeland, and while grocery-taquerias may not show up on the corners of Cuernavaca, they are organized in New York along typically Mexican lines. Almost always they are family enterprises, with the men generally in charge of the grocery, and the women handling the cooking. It's not surprising. While a legion of Mexican men cook in restaurant kitchens throughout New York, the kitchens of Mexican homes are ruled by women.
"In Mexico, women are the owners of the kitchen," said Carmen Boullosa, a Mexican poet and novelist who lives in Brooklyn. "You really have to be a revolutionary soul in Mexico to cook if you are a man."
When you enter one of these taquerias you are in a way joining an extended family that seems to embrace each customer. Often the television is on, showing soccer games or soap operas, soundlessly so as not to compete with the blare of the jukebox. A child might be playing on the floor as mother and grandmother work the counter. People come in and out, issuing friendly greetings. Everybody seems welcome and accepted. 
The food is family style as well. Though the menu changes little from taqueria to taqueria, the details vary. Each place has its own recipe for tacos and tamales, folk dishes with the proverbial secret ingredient. At Hidalgo, Carmen Fuentes, who owns the taqueria with her husband, Carlos Sanchez, serves tacos spread with salty, intensely flavorful guacamole. Her carnitas are chunky, with an almost crisp exterior, while the stewed goat, served on weekends, is wonderfully mellow. At Tehuitzingo, the carnitas are soft with a nutty flavor, the taco neat and compact, sprinkled with queso fresco and a salsa verde tangy with the taste of tomatillos. The tacos al pastor, made with chunks of roasted pork, are superb, and Tehuitzingo often serves chicharron tacos, made with almost jellylike pork skin that is far less chewy and more flavorful than you might expect.
"People are serving stuff that they serve at home," Ms. Sibley said. "Sometimes it's really good, sometimes not."
At Zaragoza, the tacos are filled to overflowing with tender lengua or cecina -- tongue or salted beef -- along with onions, cilantro, lettuce and red or green salsa. The delicious tamales are removed from their cornhusks and served drizzled with grated cheese, crema and lettuce. At La Vega in Corona, Queens, a deli with a small room that holds a half-dozen tables, the tacos are small and delicate, subtly flavored, accompanied by a thick, spicy salsa verde. At Las Conchitas, the bakery in Sunset Park, the tacos are also petite -- you can easily eat three for lunch -- and the salsa verde is thinner and milder. 
Homesickness is evident in the names of the groceries that are in front of the taquerias -- Zaragoza and Tehuitzingo are the hometowns of the owners. Modesty, too. No matter how proud a cook might be if you enjoy her tacos or tamales, she most likely would insist on directing you across the street to a restaurant for even better ones.
"Most of the Mexicans in New York are working class," Ms. Boullosa said. "They are running away from poverty, but they are not running away from their country." She said many send much of their earnings to their families back in Mexico, and fantasize about returning to live there one day.
As is typical in households of such recent immigrants, the children must do much of the English speaking for their parents. Why did Miguel Fuentes (no relation to Carmen) and Matilde Lopez start offering food at Tehuitzingo Deli? Simple enough, answered their son, Abraham Fuentes. "Customers came and they wanted to eat here," he said.
Few of the grocery taquerias are as elaborate or have as advanced a business plan as Hidalgo in Queens, which has been in business 10 years. It has always sold sandwiches and tacos, Carmen Fuentes said, but the counter was added four months ago with an eye to a steady stream of customers from the school down the block that is under construction and due to open in September. 
Ms. Fuentes is from Costa Rica, but her husband is Mexican and she learned to cook for him. Now she oversees a small crew of women who prepare her recipes. Almost every day she has tacos with several fillings and tamales, wrapped either in cornhusks or banana leaves (the difference is subtle). She serves fabulous roasted chicken, tangy and moist as if lacquered in citrus. But many of the specialties are available only on weekends, like carnitas and barbacoa, pozole soup and tripe.
There is no menu, so you either have to know what is available, or just luck out. Sitting at the counter one afternoon, I noticed a woman making gorditas. She picked up a handful of masa, or corn dough, and shaped it into a pocket around a dollop of braised pork and closed the edges. She put it in a pan to fry, and as it sizzled enticingly, I gestured toward it. She gestured back, and we had closed the deal. 
When it was done frying, she scooped it up, cut open an end, stuffed it with crumbled cheese and cream and handed it to me on a square paper plate. It was delicious, like a sandwich on a dense corn muffin. From a corner of the counter, Ms. Fuentes beamed. Her extended family was growing bigger.

6 Great Tacos For $2 or Less

ALMOST every Mexican neighborhood in New York City has a few delis or groceries that conceal taquerias, like these six. Most are open all day, from breakfast until after dinner, and all are inexpensive, $2 or so for a taco. The selections are modest, but almost always expand on the weekends.

FAST AND FRESH DELI -- 84 Hoyt Street, near Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 802-1661. A neat storefront that gives no indication of Mexican foods, except for the Mexicans sitting at the bright counter and the man behind the deli case, who makes fine beef, pork and chicken tacos.

HIDALGO MEXICAN FOOD PRODUCTS -- 30-11 29th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 274-6936. Great selection of Mexican products, and an inviting counter. Almost everything, whether tacos, tamales or roasted chicken or pork, is delicious. Try the refreshing aguas frescas, beverages flavored with fruit, herbs and spices.

LAS CONCHITAS -- 48-11 Fifth Avenue, Sunset Park, Brooklyn, (718) 437-5513. A small bakery with racks of bright, sugary Mexican pastries. In the rear, a small selection of compact, almost delicate tacos. Dim and rustic.

LA VEGA -- 103-07 Roosevelt Avenue, Corona, Queens, (718) 397-9362. One room of this deli has been turned into an actual restaurant, with an extended menu. The tacos are carefully made and delicious.

TEHUITZINGO DELI AND GROCERY -- 695 10th Avenue, near 47th Street, (212) 397-5956. The rear of the deli is a colorful and festive counter. Tacos carnitas and al pastor are excellent. Unusual fillings, like pork skin, are also available.

ZARAGOZA MEXICAN DELI AND GROCERY -- 215 Avenue A, near 14th Street, East Village, (212) 780-9204. A tiny bodega with a small selection of tacos that changes every day, and good tamales. ERIC ASIMOV

HEADLINE: Propping Up Dictators 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
For years, Western governments have sent billions in aid to African countries. More often than not, this money served only to prop up dictators, undermining democratic accountability. 
Leaders who receive money from outside feel fewer obligations toward the needs and desires of their own people and also encourage the endemic societal corruption so tellingly described in "The Country That a President Never Gets to See" (Letter From Africa, July 16).
 If Nigeria and other countries are to escape poverty, then African leaders must be committed to the rule of law, protection of private property and economic freedom. 
 America and Europe can also help by eliminating the huge farm subsidies that reduce world-market prices for our goods. Ending subsidies would be a politically courageous act that could help our continent combat poverty and disease.

HEADLINE: In Patagonia, Sheep Ranches Get AnotherChance 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HILL STATION LOS POZOS, Argentina 

 BODY:
Patagonia was first tamed a century ago by hardy pioneer families who established vast sheep ranches like this one to supply voracious markets in Europe and the United States with mutton and wool. Now, after a decade-long crisis that nearly wiped out both those industries here, Patagonia's producers are reclaiming their birthright.
 Over the last 18 months, wool prices, which had hovered around $3 a kilogram in the 1990's, have surged to record highs of as much as $9 here. Argentina's mutton exports nearly doubled in 2002, to nearly $500 million, and in the first quarter of this year they doubled again compared with the same period last year. 
 The resurgence is perhaps most perceptible here in Santa Cruz, a huge but sparsely populated province at the extreme southern tip of South America that is the home of President Nestor Kirchner. Twice the size of New York State, but with less than 200,000 inhabitants, Santa Cruz is a place where even after the contraction of the last decade, sheep continue to outnumber people by a ratio of more than 10 to 1.
"There has been a notable recovery here during the past year, and the timing couldn't have been better for us," said Enrique Rosell, president of the Santa Cruz Agrarian Council. "The market has really improved, and producers who had given up, because, let's face it, nobody likes losing money, are taking heart and becoming active again."
Increasingly, those local producers are being joined by foreign investors. Companies like the Italian clothing manufacturer Benetton have bought up struggling or bankrupt ranches and introduced new technologies, and a delegation of rabbis recently visited the provincial capital, Rio Gallegos, to see about setting up a kosher slaughterhouse that would supply mutton to Israel.
Much of the stimulus to renew production can be attributed to the drastic devaluation of the Argentine peso early last year. From January to April, the peso lost more than 70 percent of its value against the dollar, which meant that sheep ranchers who exported their output watched their income nearly quadruple in peso terms.
That stands in sharp contrast to the previous decade, when the peso was linked to the dollar at a fixed one-to-one exchange rate. As the value of the dollar rose against other currencies, so did the peso's, making production costs throughout Patagonia sohigh that ranchers were operating at a loss.
"Wool prices were already on the decline, and the domestic textile industry was also losing markets because of high costs and cheap imports," said Javier Urquiza, a veterinarian and third-generation sheep rancher who recently resumed production on his 62,000-acre estate. "That made for an explosive cocktail."
At the peak of production here just before World War II, Santa Cruz had more than 1,500 ranches and 7.5 million sheep. Over the years those numbers declined gradually, but in the 1990's they fell sharply, from more than four million head of sheep on 1,200 ranches to less than two million on fewer than 600 ranches.
Some of the shuttered ranches were simply abandoned, especially after a volcanic eruption in 1992 scattered ash over pastureland and two devastating snowstorms in the mid-1990's wiped out flocks. Squatters occupied some manor homes, while thieves looted others of equipment and fixtures.
To weather those difficult times, Eduardo Halliday and his wife Sylvia, the owners of Hill Station Los Pozos, turned to tourism, drawing visitors from Europe and the United States to their 75,000-acre farm. One of Patagonia's oldest sheep ranches, Hill Station Los Pozos was founded in 1885 by Mr. Halliday's great-grandfather, an immigrant from Scotland who built a sturdy manor house that is still standing.
"We'd open our house for four months a year, and have 200 or so visitors a month, all of that for a $2,000 profit," Mr. Halliday, 43, said in a recent interview. "You do what you have to to survive, but a moment comes when you say to yourself, 'It's not worth it,' and we were glad to be able to give it up" three years ago.
But the comeback that Mr. Halliday and other producers are experiencing has also been helped by developments abroad. The huge stock built up by Australia, the world's leading wool producer, in the 1990's in a failed attempt to dictate prices has dwindled, so there is no longer an excess supply to depress the market.
At the same time, oil prices have also risen, and the price of the artificial fibers that had displaced wool in some markets has gone up, making natural fibers like wool newly attractive and competitive.
Meat exporters here are also benefiting. In Europe, mad cow disease has made mutton more appealing to consumers, and producers here have been quick to discover that Patagonia is a brand name that commands top prices in markets like Britain, France, Italy and Spain.
To help move the recovery along, the federal and provincial governments are investing in the industry. A recent law set aside nearly $70 million to help restore production and modernize technology over the next decade. Sheep ranchers say this is welcome but not enough to meet all their needs.
The resurgence in production has also brought with it a new set of problems. As sheep ranchers return to the business, they need more ewes to build their flocks, which has led to what is known here as the "shortage of wombs."
As a result, ewes are being withheld longer from slaughter so that ranchers do not have to pay exorbitant prices at auction for females in their reproductive prime. That, in turn, means that for years to come, Argentina will not be able to fulfill the annual 23,000-ton quota for mutton that the European Union has allotted it.
The recovery is also being limited by labor shortages. Rather than toil for long periods away from their families on a sheep ranch for wages not that much different from those of a store clerk, workers prefer to look for jobs in the oil industry, in tourism or even on fishing boats.
"Our grandparents lived on their ranches in the same way as people in the city, listening to the radio and using coal stoves," said Carlos Milicevic, director of the Estancias de Patagonia packing house in Rio Gallegos. "Today, though, living conditions in the countryside are vastly inferior to the city, and it is hard to attract workers."
Sensing opportunities, foreign companies have begun moving into a business that has traditionally been dominated by Anglo-Argentine families, buying up ranches for production and tourism. Benetton has been especially active, acquiring so much land and so many flocks that it is now the largest producer in the province, with estimates that one in every 10 sheep is being raised on a Benetton ranch.
"Things are never going to go back to what they were, because that would be impossible and not make economic sense," said Enrique Ibanez, director of the Santa Cruz Rural Society, a sheep ranchers group. "But Patagonia is still a land of opportunity for those who are up to the challenge."

HEADLINE: About New York; 
Claws Over Broadway

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
A REVOLVING 10-foot lobster now adorns Times Square, its gaudy red neon beckoning passers-by to come in, come in, you know you want to come in. Fried popcorn shrimp. Artichoke lobster dip. Come in, the theater can wait. There will be other trains. It's "endless crab" season; all you can eat.
 With this spinning plastic creature, the Red Lobster chain staked its first claim in Manhattan yesterday, opening a three-story restaurant at the corner of 41st Street and Seventh Avenue. Beginning at 11 a.m., tourists from Duluth, Minn., or Tucker, Ga., could leaven their exotic Times Square experience with the comfort food of home. 
 The Admiral's Feast of fried sea things, for example, for $19.50. Or the Parrot Bay Coconut Shrimp appetizer ("Jumbo shrimp dipped in coconut batter flavored with Captain Morgan's Parrot Bay rum, lightly fried and served with a pina colada sauce"). Ahoy, matey, and only $8.99.
Some defenders of New York culture might see the addition of a Red Lobster to the Great White Way as another example of the corporatization of Times Square; the Disneyfication; the nadir. That argument, though, raises the question of what is worse: the popcorn shrimp of today, or the sex trade of yesterday?
Besides, people need work -- as evidenced by the thousands of job inquiries that the restaurant received in the months before it added that gaudy red bauble to the Times Square necklace. Red Lobster officials, whose eager-to-please smiles made them easy to pick out at yesterday's grand opening, estimated that about 10,000 people had asked about jobs, and about 5,000 had gone through a rigorous interview process.
Among the 300 people hired was Gretchen Bieber, 23 years old and determined to wait on tables between auditions in musical theater, which is what drew her from Missouri in the first place. She described the crush of people applying for jobs as "madness," but she endured the process, she said, because "I wanted this job."
There was Ricardo Vicens, 23, a student of computer animation who will be commuting from Union City, N.J. He was so happy to have his job as waiter -- which pays $3.30 an hour, plus tips and benefits -- that he planned to work a double shift yesterday, from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m.
"I have been so impressed with Red Lobster," he said, exhibiting the enthusiasm that earned him a "total commitment" gold pin during the training sessions.
And there was Jorge Camacho, 35, a product of East Harlem who lives in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and has three children. An experienced waiter who is also an assistant pastor at an East Harlem church, he spent many weeks looking for a job.
"It was extremely hard," he said, a half-hour before the restaurant's doors opened. "But I was fortunate enough to be blessed with being hired."
The three waiters would have continued to talk about the blessing that is Red Lobster were it not for a supervisor's call to attend the "lobster talk": a small pep rally at which they learn what to recommend to customers. Yesterday's featured drink: Sunset Passion, a pina colada with coconut rum, topped with strawberry puree.
WHETHER they realize it or not, the 300 new employees are being counted on by Red Lobster to bring a New York sensibility to the chain's new advertising campaign of "share the love." 
Share the what?
Wendy Spirduso, the communications director for Red Lobster, based in Orlando, Fla., said that according to customer surveys, the emotional and economic turmoil of 9/11 has prompted people to reconnect with friends and family through casual dining. "Seafood helps them to connect," she said. "There is an emotional attachment to the seafood and the people around the dinner table."
A company news release on the "share the love" campaign provided further explication: " 'Breaking through the shell' of seafood is a metaphor for human connection as people seek to break through their tough outer shells." A concept that essentially equates humankind to a bowl of steamed clams might be a bit Off Off Broadway for Times Square. (Would that be "in a rich, roasted garlic sauce," for $9.99?) But New York is nothing if not a place of religious and culinary tolerance.
As expected, the lunch crowd descended upon the new place on Seventh Avenue. Waiters pushed the Sunset Passion and the all-you-can-eat crab. Two men briefly protested the plight of lobster divers in Belize. Thunder and lightning came and went.
And when it was over, about 600 people in Times Square had dined at the 677th restaurant in the Red Lobster chain.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: OCCUPATION; 
U.S. to Outline 60-Day Plan For Iraq Rebuilding Projects

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22 

 BODY:
The top American civilian administrator in Iraq is to announce on Wednesday a 60-day plan for that nation, including restoring power to prewar levels, resuming criminal courts, awarding mobile-telephone licenses, and distributing revised textbooks to newly opened schools.
 The detailed set of security, economic and political objectives, to be described in a speech here by the administrator, L. Paul Bremer III, is intended to rebut growing criticism from some in Congress, aid agencies and even some military officers in Iraq that the civilian occupation authorities have no clearly defined path ahead for postwar rebuilding. 
 Since arriving here from Baghdad over the weekend, Mr. Bremer has appeared on the Sunday news programs, met with lawmakers and conferred with President Bush's top advisers to outline his blueprint for what many officials say is a make-or-break period for the reconstruction. He is to meet with Mr. Bush on Wednesday. "There's a lot of talk that we have no plan, and don't know what we're doing," Mr. Bremer said in interview at the Pentagon today. "Well, we have a plan and we're executing that plan." 
Mr. Bremer acknowledged that his $6 billion budget for the next six months would nearly deplete his available funds, from sources like appropriated money and Iraqi oil revenue, and his budget for the 2004 fiscal year was now projected to run a deficit. "We'll need more money," he said, noting that allies will hold a donor's conference in Europe in October. Mr. Bremer said he was awaiting a comprehensive assessment by the World Bank of what was needed in Iraq, which he expected by about Sept. 10.
Mr. Bremer, on the job for about two months, said one task on his visit was to manage expectations of the pace of reconstruction. He said most of the damage to Iraq's power grid, water system, ministries and other infrastructure was from three decades of neglect under Saddam Hussein, not the three-week war, and would take years to fix.
The plan Mr. Bremer is to outline at the National Press Club here, a draft of which was obtained by The New York Times, sets 60-day and 120-day deadlines for accomplishments in a wide range of areas, and forecasts some goals well into next year.
For example, on security, the American-led occupation force is aiming within the next 60 days to recruit and train one battalion of a new Iraq national army; create eight battalions, or nearly 7,000 members, of a new Iraqi civil defense force that will free thousands of American troops for antiguerrilla missions; operate a police academy for new recruits, which has just started in Baghdad; resume trials before a central criminal court; and start training new judges.
Many of these goals are well under way. The only question is whether they will meet the deadlines, and Mr. Bremer acknowledged that there would probably be instances where the allies would fall short.
Throughout most of the country, Iraqis are urging the allies to restore electricity, and Mr. Bremer has pledged to restore power to prewar levels within the next 60 days. That will mean diverting some electricity from Baghdad, which in recent years has enjoyed power nearly 24 hours a day, to outlying provinces.
Mr. Bremer is also focusing on reviving Iraq's economy by permitting private banks to help state banks, assist state-owned enterprises that employed thousands of people, and begin a loan program to stimulate small to medium businesses, including those run by women. The allies will also work to devise a plan to spend the country's oil revenues and reform its tax system.
On the civil affairs side, the allies intend in the next 60 days to help establish independent media outlets, support the new Iraqi Governing Council's efforts to create a new constitution, and support the interim ministers and their senior advisers among the allies.
Relaying information about this plan and the allies' goals for Iraq to the Iraqi public, through radio, television and other news media, has been less successful, American officials said. "We need to do a much better job in public information," Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz said after a five-day trip to Iraq.

HEADLINE: Private Equity Deals Are Again the Talkof Europe 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 22 

 BODY:
All the big names in leveraged buyouts are on the prowl for deals in Europe. But the going is not easy. 
 The action is shifting away from Britain, the preferred playground for buyout firms until recently, to the Continent, where potential deals abound but the political, cultural and legal hurdles are higher. 
 With that shift, the dominance of the big British and American specialists who reigned over the boom of the 1990's is being challenged by local competition and complicated by the depressed level of asset prices and the difficulty that some firms have had in realizing gains from earlier deals because of the economic downturn. 
In the second quarter, the total value of private equity deals across Europe fell to its lowest level in four years: 10.8 billion euros ($12.24 billion at current exchange rates), down sharply from 16.3 billion euros in the first quarter and 25.1 billion euros in the last quarter of 2002, according to Initiative Europe, a British-based research firm that tracks the market. 
And while most buyout firms have plenty of cash, they are not raising new money as quickly as before -- 24 billion euros in 2002, a 37 percent decline from 2001.
But the second half of this year promises a harvest of major deals. In Britain, CVC Capital Partners and the Texas Pacific Group are expected to conclude a deal for Debenhams, a British department store chain, worth some $2.4 billion. Scottish and Newcastle, the big British brewer, will probably conclude a sale of its chain of pubs that could yield $3.2 billion. Telecom Italia is expected to complete a sale of a controlling stake in its directory publishing subsidiary, SEAT Pagine Gialle, to a group of leveraged buyout firms including CVC Capital and Permira, in a two-stage deal that could bring in as much as $6.7 billion.
"The second half could very well be a good one" for deals, said Nicholas Gordon, director of research at Initiative Europe. "Industry practitioners would probably agree that it's a good time for the market."
Edward A. Gilhuly, managing director in Europe for the big American buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, agrees, though he acknowledges that the environment has become challenging. In some respects, he said, Europe was hurt less by the market downturn than the United States was, because European investors had shown less enthusiasm for the 1990's new economy bubble to begin with. "They have a little bit less to come back from," he said.
Many private equity firms have emerged with plenty of cash. Kohlberg Kravis, for example, had $3 billion in its Millennium fund in 1999 and has since expanded it to $5 billion, Mr. Gilhuly said, with an eye toward international investment. As European economies soured, he said, many companies found themselves with business assets they wanted to shed. But investors had no appetite for new public offerings and few companies were making acquisitions, so the private equity investors had the field to themselves. 
In December, Kohlberg Kravis wrapped up a buyout of a French electrical products maker, Legrand, in a deal whose value then of $3.6 billion made it the largest to date in Europe. But it also illustrated how complex deal making had become.
In January 2001, a French rival, Schneider, offered to acquire Legrand, but the deal was blocked by European regulators on antitrust grounds. Schneider appealed, and the appeal process was expected to take more than a year. In the meantime, Kohlberg Kravis reached an agreement with Schneider last July that if the appeal did not succeed, it would take Legrand off Schneider's hands.
"We were taking a bet that they would not win, or that if they won, it would be not in the way they wanted," Mr. Gilhuly of Kohlberg Kravis said. In the end, Schneider did win its case, but it decided to sell anyway.
Even so, Mr. Gilhuly acknowledges, the deal might not have gone through had Kohlberg Kravis not involved a French partner, Wendel Investissement, controlled by the industrialist Ernest-Antoine Selliere. 
Why the French partner? "We'll never know whether we could have been an alternative buyer without them," Mr. Gilhuly said. "It eliminated an issue that might have gotten in the way."
Britain and Ireland remain the principal field for European private equity deals, with 39 percent of the total by value in the first half of the year. But France is gaining fast,with 29 percent in the first half, far ahead of Germany's 11 percent and a big jump from a 19 percent share in 2002. Not surprisingly, French financial companies have been accelerating their activities.
Last July, Lazard brought in Patrick Sayer, who had overseen its banking, media and telecommunications business in New York, to run Eurazeo, a $3.5 billion holding company closely linked to Lazard and its chairman, Michel David-Weill. Mr. Sayer has transformed Eurazeo into one of Europe's most aggressive equity investors. In January, he engineered an $840 million buyout of Fraikin, a truck rental business, from the Fiat group; a month later, he bought a 23 percent stake in the European aerospace group Eutelsat for $486 million.
But buyout firms continue to meet cultural, commercial and political resistance, and not just in France. Often, the objections are raised on security concerns.
In 1999, when the Texas Pacific Group bought a controlling stake in Gemplus, a French maker of smart cards, critics suspected an American bid to seize strategic European technology -- suspicions that were redoubled when Texas Pacific named Alex Mandl to run Gemplus. Mr. Mandl, once a rising star at AT&T, also served on the board of In-Q-Tel, a venture capital fund established the same year by the C.I.A. to invest in companies working on technology that could be of use to intelligence agencies.
In Germany, after One Equity Partners of Chicago paid 700 million euros last year for Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, a leading builder of nonnuclear submarines, the government proposed limiting foreign ownership of military contractors. One Equity is now trying to sell Howaldtswerke.
Several acquisitions by the Carlyle Group, including a buyout of Fiat's military and aerospace unit, FiatAvio, and of a British military laboratory, QinetiQ, have also raised European eyebrows. Last month, the French defense minister, Michele Alliot-Marie, ordered an investigation into military-related buyouts by American companies.
Carlyle draws suspicion because several of its directors have been important political figures, including James A. Baker III, secretary of state under the first President George Bush, and Frank C. Carlucci, a secretary of defense under Ronald Reagan. The former British prime minister, John Major, oversees Carlyle's European operations.
Jacques Garaialde, who left the Carlyle Group earlier this year to help Kohlberg Kravis develop its business in France, said the concern was at least partly understandable. "If you saw a French fund buying out an American company in a sensitive domain," he said, "what would the reaction be?" 
Still, he said he did not think that the momentum of the buyout firms on the Continent would be stopped because there was still plenty of room for growth. As a percentage of the total economy, he said, deal volumes in Britain are at least 10 times those on the Continent and in the United States the difference is even greater. 
"It's an education process," he said, "both in business and among politicians."

HEADLINE: Washing 'South' Out of Bronx Mouths; 
Hoping That 'Downtown Bronx' Will Sound More Uptown

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
It has been said that the human spirit is by nature optimistic and that the slightest changes have the power to elevate its mood. When people are feeling mired, they may change hairstyles or brands of beer, but rarely can a neighborhood comfort itself by changing habits all at once.
 It can, however, change its name. 
 Take the South Bronx, for example, where a growing group of residents say they have tired of being thought of as the ugly stepchild of the borough. The neighborhood, they say, has outgrown its reputation as a place of drive-by shootings, poverty and apartment buildings racked by flame. 
In an effort to repair the broken window of its image, they have decided to leave the social work to the social workers and the redevelopment to the developers. They have instead have embarked upon a somewhat quixotic mission to improve the image of the neighborhood by changing its name.
"The South Bronx will become the Downtown Bronx, believe you me," said George Rodriguez, who is leading the campaign.
Mr. Rodriguez is the chairman of Community Board 1, which serves Melrose, Mott Haven and Port Morris, and he has lived in the South Bronx for more than 40 years. As befits a man who has placed great faith in the healing power of language, Mr. Rodriguez speaks of his particular tilt at the windmills of prejudice in eloquent, if slightly tortured, terms.
"We are extraordinarily gung-ho in this matter," he said last week. "It has not been undertaken capriciously or contrary to good thinking, but to change the stigma. If you take a helicopter and go upstairs into the sky and look down, you will see that the neighborhood has changed."
He is correct. The South Bronx is no longer the blockswideconflagration that shocked the country during the 1977 World Series when the Goodyear blimp flew above its streets and beamed horrific images of rampant fires and billowing smoke to television viewers across the nation. Nor is it quite the zone of desolation caught by news cameras that year when President Jimmy Carter tiptoed through the gutted rubble of Charlotte Street.
Nonetheless, the neighborhood has problems not easily fixed by switching a couple of words on its street signs. The South Bronx is part of the poorest Congressional district in the country. Unemployment is nearly 20 percent. More than half the children in the district live in poverty, according to the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation. Half the population relies on public assistance. A third of the households earn less than $10,000 a year.
This onslaught of statistical misery has done little, if anything, to curb the enthusiasm of Mr. Rodriguez and his partners, who say their first order of business is to place new signs on the Bronx side of the Willis Avenue, Madison Avenue and Triborough Bridges saying, "Welcome to the Downtown Bronx."
In the three months since the City section of The New York Times reported on the movement to rename the South Bronx, Mr. Rodriguez has reached out to the boards of several local institutions, from Lincoln Hospital to Hostos College, to generate support. His group is also working with members of the City Council to have the neighborhood's name officially changed.
"I am more than highly optimistic," Mr. Rodriguez said, "that all of this will occur next year."
That said, there is plenty of time to delve into the history of the South Bronx, a term that came into use in the late 1940's, according to Lloyd Ultan, the borough historian.
Mr. Ultan said the term was coined by social workers who had noticed pockets of poverty appearing in the neighborhoods around 138th Street as black and Latino families escaped the crowding of Harlem by flooding northward after World War II. By the 1950's, everything south of 149th Street was considered to be the South Bronx. By the 1960's, it was everything south of the Cross-Bronx Expressway. By the 1970's, Mr. Ultan said, the border had crept north to Fordham Road.
"I remember saying once that if this keeps going, anything south of McLean Avenue would soon be the South Bronx, and McLean Avenue is in Yonkers," he added.
Oddly enough, there was never a section of the Bronx that was thought of as a downtown area, Mr. Ultan said. It is different from Brooklyn, for example, where a clearly defined downtown sits in the neighborhood surrounding Borough Hall. The Bronx had -- and still has -- transportation and business hubs, but they are far-flung, Mr. Ultan said, from the main government office on 161st Street to the shopping districts of Co-op City and Fordham Road.
To consider the South Bronx as the Downtown Bronx does not, however, offend him.
"Frankly," he said, "it's just as good as any other place."
The South Bronx is hardly the first location in the country that has tried to polish its image with a name change, and it could be instructive to determine whether other towns and cities have benefited by a switch.
"I haven't seen it do a thing for our town, and I've been living here since I was 18," said Shirley Wadding, 58, who is the mayor of Lake Station, Ind., which changed its name from East Gary in 1977. "Basically, we didn't want to be associated with Gary anymore, but all it got us was our own identity."
The residents of Eastpointe, Mich., could be considered experts inthe name-change game. The town, on the eastern border of Detroit, has gone through five names.
Founded by Irish Protestants, it was first known as Orange. When Irish Catholics moved in, it became Erin Township. Because it is halfway between Detroit and Mount Clemens, it was later called Halfway. Eventually, it became East Detroit, a name that stuck until 1993, when its residents, perhaps exhausted, settled on Eastpointe.
"I wasn't in favor of that last change," said Harvey Curley, who was mayor then. "I guess I'm the nostalgic, traditional sort."
Some places have found a tremendous boon in changing their names. In fact, one need look no farther than Sleepy Hollow in Westchester County to find an example of improvement by renaming.
Sleepy Hollow, which was known as North Tarrytown as recently as 1996, found inspiration for its new name in "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by Washington Irving, who had a large estate there. When the movie "Sleepy Hollow" was released a few years ago, the tourists and investors started coming to town in semi-impressive numbers. 
"We get all types of people calling and visiting," said Mayor Philip Zegarelli. "It's a mysterious name with a mystique all its own. It has a type of cachet on the ground."
Unfortunately, the Downtown Bronx lacks a certain cachet and does not quite roll off the tongue with the same sort of spooky allure. Not that Mr. Rodriguez cares a whit. 
"I concur somewhat about the name," he said, "but the Downtown Bronx is exactly what it is. You've got the north Bronx, the west Bronx, the east Bronx and the Downtown Bronx.
"Just not the South Bronx, you understand?"

HEADLINE: Major Change in Mental Health Care Is Urged 

BYLINE:  By DENISE GRADY 

 BODY:
Mental health care in America is often inadequate and needs "fundamental transformation," a presidential commission reported yesterday. 
 The commission described the present system as a "patchwork relic" of disjointed state and federal agencies that frequently stepped in the way of people who were seeking care instead of helping them. The panel said each state should draw up plans to treat the mentally ill. 
 The report called for a more streamlined system strongly focused on early diagnosis and treatment in patients' own communities, a high expectation of recovery and methods for helping people with mental illnesses find work and housing. 
One proposed means of early diagnosis would use questionnaires to screen high-school students, with parental permission, for signs of mental or emotional disturbance, with follow-up testing and treatment for those who need it.
The report did not recommend increased spending on mental health, but called for a more coordinated and efficient use of the money available now.
The commission also said mental health should be addressed with the same urgency as physical health, with equivalent insurance coverage. Currently, many plans put tighter limits treating mental illness than for physical ailments, and President Bush has asked Congress to pass "mental health parity" legislation, requiring equal coverage.
About 5 to 7 percent ofAmerican adults have serious mental illnesses, according to the report, and 5 to 9 percent of children suffer serious emotional disturbances. 
The report was prepared by the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, a 22-member group that Mr. Bush formed in April 2002. The commissioners included psychologists and psychiatrists, as well as administrators from state and federal agencies. In 86 pages, they discussed the failings of the current system and described six major goals for transformation. 
Advocacy groups for the mentally ill praised the report.
"I think it brings us out of the dark ages," said Richard Birkel, national executive director of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. "The goals and standards they have set are good ones. Get people into treatment early, have high expectations of recovery. This is the opposite of what we have now. This really envisions a very modern health care system in mental health."
The main shortcoming of the report, Mr. Birkel said, is "limitations in terms of actual next steps, a clear road map for how we get there."
But, he added: "I'm not surprised by these limitations. Otherwise it would have been a five-year report. They had less than a year to finish this. For a one-year report, it's remarkable." 
Bill Emmet, a project director at the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, said: "We think it's a once-in-a-generation opportunity to assess the mental health system in this country, and the report comes through with recommendations that, if implemented, will change the direction of mental health services in this country. I think the 'if implemented' is the critical caveat."
Mr. Emmet said the details of instituting the changes were not really the goal of the report. 
"I think," he said, "it's up to us as advocates, and up to our champions in Congress, to move from this platform to the nitty-gritty." 
Dr. Marcia Goin, president of the America Psychiatric Association, said that the report gave an honest portrayal of "the mental health system in a shambles." Dr. Goin said many mentally ill people became lost in the system and wound up living on the streets or, if they lack needed medication, in jail for petty crimes. The report notes that 30,000 Americans a year commit suicide, many with undiagnosed or untreated mental illnesses. Attempted suicides lead to hundreds of thousands of hospital visits a year.
"It's a horrendous system across the country," Dr. Goin said. 
She noted that the commission worked under the assumption that financing for mental health programs would not increase.
"But the reality is that there needs to be a big structural change," Dr. Goin added. "And you can't do that without funding." 
The value of the report, she said, is that advocacy groups can use it to back their statements when they ask state legislatures and other agencies to pay for treatment.
Officials and others expect direction on reaching the goals from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a $3.2 billion-a-year agency in the Health and Human Services Department. 
The director of the agency, Charles G. Curie, said, "We'll conduct now a thorough review and assessment of the report and begin to outline a clear action plan."
"I anticipate an action plan within just a matter of two to three months," he said. 
Mr. Curie said his agency had been working with other agencies on translating research findings into treatment more quickly and eliminate the current 15- to 20-year lag.
Mr. Birkel's group also issued a report yesterday that hecalled a companion piece to the commission report. His group's report was based on a survey of more than 3,400 people with serious mental illnesses and their families. Most, 86 percent, were from 18 to 54 years old. 
The survey found that two-thirds were unemployed and that more than half relied on public programs. Some said they wanted to work, but had been offered just positions that did not provide insurance for mental health. If they take the positions, they lose government coverage.
In the last year, nearly half had been hospitalized, 40 percent had sought emergency care for their mental problems and 44 percent had been arrested or detained by the police. 
Mr. Birkel said of the commission's report: "Was it a good report? That depends on what happens in the next six months to a year. If it works as well as we hope to stimulate action, then it will be a great report. If it's a snapshot of a system in shambles in 2003 and nothing happens, it will be a terrible report."

HEADLINE: California Recall Backer Feels Heat 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 22 

 BODY:
Most Californians have never heard of Darrell Issa, the millionaire congressman who is bankrolling the effort to recall Gov. Gray Davis. But chances are, many know his voice.
 Before he embarked on a second career in politics, Mr. Issa, a conservative Republican from San Diego, made a $100 million fortune in the car-alarm business. That was his recorded voice on the Viper alarm system warning the interloper and stray dog alike to "please step away from the car." 
 "That's me," said Mr. Issa, raising his eyebrows, while sitting in his sparse campaign headquarters along the loop of John Wayne International Airport in Orange County, nothing on his desk but potato chips and a diet soda. "That made me a celebrity, sort of." 
It also made him the money that allowed him to pour millions into his political career, including $1.6 million into the effort to remove the Democratic governor from the Statehouse and insert himself in it.
And it provides a tasty backdrop for his opponents who are looking for ways to discredit the man who has brought California to the brink of this extraordinary political moment.
Because try as he might to step away from the car, Mr. Issa is bombarded at every turn with calls for an explanation to those nagging questions about two arrests for car theft in his youth.
"This stuff is 30 years old," said Mr. Issa, dressed in a blue polo shirt and khakis, his hair combed and parted with tonic, not hair spray as preferred by political veterans.
Such is the state of California politics. Already $38 billion in the red, the state is expected to have to finance a $30 million referendum on a governor who was just elected last November. On the same ballot California voters will be asked to pick a new governor should they back a recall. 
And you can blame Darrell Issa or thank him for propelling a movement that just a few months ago looked as if it was going nowhere. The signatures needed to put the measure on the ballot -- nearly 900,000 -- are expected to be certified this week. If so, the recall vote will occur in late September or early October.
When asked why he was sinking a sizable piece of his personal fortune and reputation into the effort, he spoke of leaving a legacy.
"Some people want to amass a great amount of wealth and make a great looking obituary," he explained. "I'm going to die with more money than is good to leave my son."
So the two-term congressman has the Democratic governor reeling. According to a recent Field poll, 51 percent of likely voters say they would support the removal of Mr. Davis from office.
But whether they would turn to Mr. Issa, 49, is another question. In April, the Field poll found that, of registered voters, 79 percent had no opinion of Mr. Issa, a sign that he was barely known. Of likely Republican candidates, former Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles, leads as the preference of likely voters, according to a July 16 Field poll.
Next comes Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor with no political experience. There is Bill Simon Jr., the conservative who lost to Mr. Davis in the last election. Next are a couple of little-knowns and at the bottom of the list is Darrell Issa.
Still, he has a Congressional seat and a $100 million fortune, and angry Democrats are determined to tar him, saying Mr. Issa's political record is shorter than his police record. They also say that his conservative views about abortion, guns and immigration are out of step with most of California.
"He might as well have tattoos on his arms," said Bob Mulholland, a campaign adviser to the California Democratic Party. "Arson, car thefts, gun charges. The man who muscled his way through life thinks he can muscle his way into the governor's office. He's mistaken."
And some Republicans, worried about his electability, are not much kinder. Despite the fact that Mr. Issa has single-handedly rejuvenated a moribund party that holds no statewide office, they say it is time for him to step aside.
"Schwarzenegger's the choice," one Republican operative said. "So, in two weeks, Republicans are going to pat Issa on the head, thank him for his service, then walk over his dead body."
Mr. Issa admits he is not gifted. He is dyslexic and to compensate for this, he says he studies hard, shoots from the hip and tries to memorize prepared statements.
"I have an I.Q. of 100 plus a little bit," he said. "I have to work real hard to get things when I read."
But now that the recall looks like a sure thing, Mr. Issa has developed his own formula to rescue California from its deficit without increasing taxes: changes in the worker's compensation system so employers pay less, wage freezes for state employees and 10 percent cuts across the board. 
An issue for Mr. Issa is whether his voting record from his conservative Southern California district would play statewide. For instance, on the votes that the National Abortion Reproductive Rights Action League considered to be the most important in 2002, Mr. Issa took its preferred position zero percent of the time. At the same time, the National Rifle Association gave him an "A" on gun issues. Voting records show him to be against most environmental measures and a big supporter of business.
Mr. Issa is of Lebanese descent and in that regard has tried to work with Arab leaders, particularly after the attacks of Sept. 11. He was the target of an assassination attempt by Irv Rubin, founder of the radical Jewish Defense League. The plot was discovered, Mr. Rubin arrested and late last yea jumped off the second tier of his cell block and died.
Mr. Issa, with an eye to one of the state's large constituencies, says he votes consistently pro-Israel. "Peace in Palestine is inevitable," he said. "The question is how do we make it happen today."
Darrell Issa was raised in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, the second of six children. His father sold trucks and worked a second job at night grinding valves. His older brother William got his own room, and the young Darrell Issa admired him.
A poor student, Mr. Issa dropped out of high school at age 17. He joined the Army. 
He was discharged on a hardship when his father fell ill and was sent home. In 1972, he and his brother William were arrested in the theft of a Maserati from a Cleveland car dealership. The case was dropped.
Last month The San Francisco Chronicle reported that in 1980, after Mr. Issa had re-enlisted in the Army as a 27-year-old officer, he was again arrested with his brother on felony auto theft charges.
The paper said that William Issa stole his brother's car, sold it to a dealership in San Jose and that within hours Darrell reported it stolen. The case was eventually dismissed for lack of evidence.
Mr. Issa offers a two-pronged defense. One is to blame it on youth. "Look, I was a kid," he said. "What would you rather have? A cardboard-cutout who never made a mistake when he was young only to become governor and then carry on like a juvenile delinquent?"
Defense No. 2: the I've-got-a-colorful-brother stratagem.
"I love my older brother Billy," said Mr. Issa, explaining that he got caught in the orbit of his ne'er-do-well brother who has five felony convictions for car theft and is currently unemployed in Cleveland. "He stole a lot of cars. He stole my car. You could say that drew me to the car alarm business. Poetic justice."
But there is the matter of possessing an unregistered handgun in Michigan a few months after the car theft charges. He was fined $100 and put on probation for carrying a long .25 millimeter semi-automatic. The gun belonged to me, says his brother Billy.
"Don't blame my brother for my sins," Billy Issa said from his home in Cleveland. 
The telephone rings. It is a political ally on the other end telling Darrell Issa that reporters are seeking more details on his past. He laughs.
"Some day," Mr. Issa tells him, "somebody's going to report on those little pineapple squares I snitched at a party."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about public scrutiny of Darrell Issa, who is financing the effort to recall Gov. Gray Davis of California, referred incorrectly to the unregistered gun he carried in the early 1970's, an offense for which he was sentenced to probation. The weapon was a .25-caliber semiautomatic, not .25-millimeter.

 With free trade in agriculture failing farmers from corn-growing peasants in the Philippines to catfish farmers in the United States, might it not be appropriate to conclude that the medicine is worse than the disease? 
 If each country actually grew its own food for its own people, we might lose a bit of the efficiency that economists assure us is the holy grail of the free market, but we wouldn't dislocate hundreds of thousands of jobs worldwide; we would improve food security for ourselves, and maybe our food would be fresher grown closer to home, too.

To the Editor:
Re "The Rigged Trade Game" (editorial, July 20): 
 As a Vermont dairy farmer, I find your implication that American farmers are partly to blame for world poverty quite a stretch. While many American farmers barely break above the poverty level themselves and many need second jobs to make a living, newspapers are filled with glossy articles that highlight the opulence, gluttony and greed of the non-farm economy. 
 The farm subsidies you criticize only try to correct market injustices that enrich many people other than farmers.

HEADLINE: Judge Dismisses Terror Charges Against Lawyer 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WILSON 

 BODY:
A federal judge yesterday dismissed charges that the lawyer Lynne F. Stewart supported terrorism by helping an imprisoned sheik direct terrorist operations in Egypt. But the judge let stand lesser charges that she lied to and defrauded the federal government.
 Ms. Stewart was accused of helping Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who was convicted of plotting to blow up New York landmarks, by helping him to pass messages to the Islamic Group, a terrorist group he once led. The charges were announced in April 2002 by Attorney General John Ashcroft, who called the case the first use of a new rule that allows the Bureau of Prisons to monitor conversations between lawyers and inmates who are threats to commit "future acts of violence or terrorism." 
 In his ruling yesterday, Judge John G. Koeltl of United States District Court called the terrorism counts against Ms. Stewart and a translator unconstitutionally vague. The judge said that the antiterrorism statute could not apply to a lawyer doing her job.
"The government fails to explain how a lawyer, acting as an agent of her client" who is an alleged leader of a terrorist organization "could avoid being subject to criminal prosecution as a 'quasi-employee,' " said Judge Koeltl, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1994. 
The charges that remain accuse her of making false statements and conspiring to defraud the government through what prosecutors say was her broken promise not to be a conduit for Mr. Abdel Rahman. 
Ms. Stewart, who has defended such unpopular clients as members of the Weather Underground and the mob informer Salvatore Gravano, suggested in an interview with The New York Times in 1995 that violence and revolution were sometimes necessary to right the economic and racial wrongs of America's capitalist system.
Yesterday, she called the ruling "a great relief," and addressed its broader implications. "It augurs well for things returning to a normalcy where the judges and courts are able to take a good look at what the government is doing, and consider what it's doing and stand up for the judicial branch and for justice," she said.
Prosecutors said they were exploring possibilities of an appeal. "We continue to believe that the statute prohibiting material support of terrorism is constitutional, and we are reviewing our appellate options," said a spokesman for James B. Comey, the United States attorney in Manhattan.
Ms. Stewart was indicted in April 2002 after visits she and a translator, Mohammed Yousry, made to the Minnesota prison where Mr. Rahman, a blind cleric, is serving a life sentence. Prosecutors said that in May 2000, she distracted prison guards during a visit with her client while Mr. Yousry took instructions from him that were later passed on to the Islamic Group in Egypt.
Mr. Abdel Rahman's instructions included a message to his followers in Egypt that they should no longer honor a halt in terrorist activities that began after a 1997 attack in Luxor, Egypt, that killed 62 people, including 58 foreign tourists. The Islamic Group claimed responsibility for the attack.
Ms. Stewart has denounced the charges since her arraignment, when she said on the courthouse steps, "They've arrested the lawyer and the interpreter. How much further? Are you going to arrest the lady who cleans the sheik's cell?"
Her lawyer, Michael E. Tigar, argued in motions that the antiterrorism statute violates the First Amendment. "It endangers the rights of people, lawyers, journalists and citizens to assert certain political views," he said yesterday.
The charges carried a 15-year sentence. The prosecution, in court papers filed in March, called Ms. Stewart "an indispensable and active facilitator of the terrorist communication network," and compared her to a "bank robbery co-conspirator who has the job of distracting security guards while others take money from the tellers, or a lookout guarding a drug dealer's corner."
Ms. Stewart rejected the claims again last night. "It's so broad that you can sweep anybody under its rug," she said of the statute. "A conduit of communication. How could you not be if you're taking phone calls from your client?"
Mr. Abdel Rahman is subject to strict security rules imposed by the government on him and certain other prisoners who are considered to pose continuing threats of violence. Ms. Stewart signed a form in May 2000 agreeing to the rules before a visit, and the government charged her in the indictment with not complying with them. Ms. Stewart said she hoped those charges would be dismissed "as a factual matter" after the hearing next month.
The case brought widespread attention because of Ms. Stewart's notoriety as an outspoken lawyer, and because of its possible implications for lawyers representing clients accused of terrorist links. "We tried to mount a real defense and organize as many people as possible," she said yesterday, "to understand that what was at stake here was the ability of defense counsel to fully represent and make decisions concerning political clients."
Also charged in the case was Ahmed Abdel Sattar, a postal worker from Staten Island, and Yassir al-Sirri, an Egyptian who was arrested in Britain in 2001 and charged with conspiring in the assassination of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the commander of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING; 
1986 Derby Winner Was Slaughtered, Magazine Reports

BYLINE:  By BILL FINLEY

 BODY:
Victories in the 1986 Kentucky Derby and the 1987 Breeders' Cup Classic figured to have earned Ferdinand a cushy retirement when his racing days were over. Instead, his life apparently ended in a grisly manner, in a Japanese slaughterhouse in 2002, according to the racing industry trade magazine The Blood-Horse, which will report his death in its issue dated July 26. It is believed that his carcass was used to make pet food.
 Efforts by the magazine to locate the horse, who was sold to Japanese interests in 1994 after a modest breeding career in the United States, led to the horse dealer Yoshikazu Watanabe. Watanabe told the magazine: "Actually, he isn't around anymore. He was disposed of late last year." 
 According to The Blood-Horse, in the Japanese racing industry, the term "disposed of" means slaughtered.
Speaking to The Associated Press, Watanabe said: "Ferdinand was disposed of during last year. He was getting old and was in some discomfort." 
Ferdinand was removed from the Japanese Horse Registry's list of thoroughbred stallions on Sept. 10, 2002. He was 19 at the time of his death.
"This is sickening, it's disgusting, it's sad, it's every bad word you can think of," said Dell Hancock, whose family owns Claiborne Farm, where Ferdinand stood at stud before he was sold. "The only positive thing I can think of is that this shows how important the efforts are of people working for the thoroughbred retirement foundations in this country. I'm so glad we have things like that here."
The problem of horse slaughter has been a continuing issue in the United States and throughout the world. Even though Americans do not consume horse meat as a practice, tens of thousands of horses are slaughtered each year in this country and shipped overseas. In the latest available statistics, 62,000 horses were slaughtered in the United States in 2001, and it is believed that about 10 percent of them were thoroughbred racehorses. Most are horses who no longer have any practical economic value as sires, broodmares or racehorses, but can still attract as much as $600 from meat buyers. 
"It's very disturbing," Bill Shoemaker, the jockey who rode Ferdinand in the 1986 Kentucky Derby, said from his home in San Marino, Calif. "He was a real good horse. He won the Kentucky Derby, but, of course, that doesn't mean anything to the Japanese. I guess he wasn't reproducing well and ended up in a slaughterhouse. It wouldn't have happened over here.
"It hits you in the stomach. Had we known they were going to do something like that, we could have bought him and brought him back here."
There are several horse-rescue operations in the United States, but they do not have the financial resources to care for every retired horse. Kentucky Derby winners, however, are pampered and revered in this country.
"The Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation is committed to stopping the slaughter of all thoroughbred racehorses, no matter what their racing stature is," said Diana Pikulski, the executive director of the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation, the nation's largest and oldest thoroughbred-rescue operation. "It saddens us deeply that a prestigious horse like Ferdinand would meet this horrific fate." 
In Japan, a retired horse may be even more likely to end up in a slaughterhouse. Land is scarce in Japan and horse meat is consumed by humans in that country, two reasons why the Japanese may be less squeamish about horse slaughter than Americans. Because the Japanese do not normally use thoroughbred horses as a source of meat for human consumption, it is very likely Ferdinand was used for pet food.
Trained by the Hall of Famer Charlie Whittingham and ridden by Shoemaker, Ferdinand retired in 1988 after winning 8 of 29 career starts and earning $3.7 million. But he was never able to pass on his greatness. From 247 foals, he produced only 8 stakes winners before being sent to Japan, where he continued to struggle as a sire.
"He was getting fewer mares here to breed than we had hoped for and thought the situation may be better for him in Japan," Hancock said. "It was just a business decision. It's such a shame it ended up the way it did."
He was sold to the JS Company in Japan and spent six breeding seasons there, but fell out of favor with breeders and was bred to only a handful of mares in his final years. According to The Blood-Horse, Watanabe acquired Ferdinand on February 3, 2001, and it appears that he briefly stood at stud at another farm before he was slaughtered.
Toshiharu Kaibazawa, a groom who took care of Ferdinand in Japan, told The Blood-Horse that the chestnut thoroughbred was "the gentlest horse you could imagine."
"He'd come over when I called to him in the pasture," Kaibazawa said. "He was so sweet."
Exceller, the only horse to defeat two Triple Crown winners when he won the 1978 Jockey Club Gold Cup over Affirmed and Seattle Slew, met a similar fate. After a failed breeding career, his life ended in 1997 when he was sold for horse meat in Sweden.

HEADLINE: Alcan Posts $89 Million Loss As It Continues Bid for Rival 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, July 22 

 BODY:
The Canadian aluminum and packaging group Alcan, which is in the throes of a hostile takeover bid for its French rival Pechiney, reported a second-quarter loss today, but attributed it mostly to nonoperational factors, like currency movements and write-downs on businesses for sale.
 Alcan's chief executive, Travis Engen, said today that the offer for Pechiney, valued at 3.4 billion euros in cash and stock ($3.85 billion), was on track, and that submissions were being finalized to the antitrust authorities at the European Union and in other countries where the two companies operate. 
 Alcan aims to complete the Pechiney deal by October, Mr. Engen said. "It's not in our interest," he said, "to go through a protracted period where management teams are distracted and customers are uncertain about the outcome." He said that Alcan would abandon its pursuit of Pechiney if it was unable to get by the first phase of antitrust approvals from the European Commission. 
The bid for Pechiney, made public on July 7, revived a similar deal that was blocked by European antitrust regulators three years ago. The earlier deal, which Pechiney supported, would have included the Alusuisse-Lonza Group of Switzerland, known as Algroup.
Alcan, based in Montreal, subsequently acquired Algroup, and Mr. Engen attributed improvements in Alcan's performance in the last year largely to savings achieved as a result of the takeover.
Alcan reported a loss of $89 million, or 28 cents a share, in the second quarter, in contrast to a profit of $71 million, or 22 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The loss included a $146 million charge for currency movements, mostly the strengthening euro and Canadian dollar, as well as a $113 million write-down on packaging businesses that Alcan has put up for sale.
Operating earnings before one-time charges fell 4 percent to $144 million, while revenues rose 10 percent to a record $3.47 billion. Victor Lazarovici, a metals analyst at BMO Nesbitt Burns in New York, said that other than higher energy costs and the currency losses, Alcan's "operations are going well." 
But on a wider front, the aluminum industry has been dogged by oversupply in Western countries. The chief economist at the Rio Tinto mining group in London, David Humphreys, said it was difficult to see how a spate of aluminum smelters currently being planned by companies around the world "can be justified in terms of supply-demand projections."
Mr. Humphreys said demand for aluminum in China was "going crazy," but even there it would have to keep expanding at a high rate to absorb planned production increases.
According to Alcan's projections, supplies of primary aluminum in Western countries will grow 3.3 percent this year, with inventories rising by 400,000 metric tons. Aluminum prices are around $1,600 a ton, down from a peak of $2,200 a ton in 1995.
The slide in prices has already prompted several mergers and takeovers. But Mr. Humphreys said that Alcan's bid for Pechiney might represent the start of a new round of mergers. "If the market is going to remain weak for the next two to three years, we need to continue with that process of rationalization and consolidation," he said. Pechiney reported a loss of 50 million euros last year.
The French company has rejected Alcan's bid as inadequate. According to some analysts, the Canadian company may have to raise its offer of 41 euros for each Pechiney share. Pechiney's stock traded today at 43.40 euros.
Hostile bids by foreign companies are rare in France, and Alcan has mounted a public relations campaign to draw attention to its substantial existing operations in France and its roots in French-speaking Quebec.
Answering a question today during a conference call with analysts, Mr. Engen said that, if the bid was successful, Alcan would probably invite some Pechiney directors to join its board.
Mr. Engen said that Alcan had not bought any shares in Pechiney. He said his company wanted to avoid the impression that it was mounting a hostile bid.
"The offer was unsolicited, but it was not in any way intended to be unfriendly," he said, noting that he and Pechiney's chief executive, Jean-Pierre Rodier, had discussed a deal several times in the last 10 months.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
Off Their Rafts, Refugees Are Still at Sea

BYLINE:  By DAVE KEHR 

 BODY:
In August 1994 Fidel Castro invited his citizens to leave Cuba if they wished. Some 50,000 people took him up on his offer, piling onto homemade rafts and setting out for Miami. 
 The exodus lasted 15 days, until President Bill Clinton reached an agreement with Mr. Castro, and the flood of immigrants was shut off. But the 50,000 refugees were left in the middle. Some arrived in Florida; others were taken at sea and returned to the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they lived in limbo while the American government tried to figure out where to place them. 
 "Balseros" -- the title is Spanish for "rafters" -- is a documentary directed by Carles Bosch and Josep M. Domenech that draws on seven years of material, much of it originally shot for the Catalan public television series "Trenta Minuts." The filmmakers follow seven rafters from the heady first days of mass departures through their periods of detention and finally into their integration, more or less, into American life, as they are resettled, mainly through the good graces of Catholic Charities, into communities from Granby, Conn., to Albuquerque. 
The filmmakers return five years later to see how the rafters have fared, and the stories are widely different. One young woman has fallen into drug dealing and desperation; a middle-aged man has found stability and some sort of happiness working as a stock clerk in an office-supply store.
"Balseros" is a polished film that will eventually make its way onto HBO but for the next two weeks will be playing at Film Forum in the South Village. Each of the major figures emerges with the clarity and complexity of full-blown novelistic characters, though with an extra element of unpredictability. The struggle brings out the best in some of them and reduces others to acts of betrayal and abandonment. If there are those who are ennobled by the experience, finding resources they never knew they possessed, there are just as many who are destroyed. 
The Cuba we glimpse in "Balseros" is a shattered country, undermined by the withdrawal of Soviet financial aid and with little to export but its music and the enduring celebrity of its charismatic leader. The America that emerges is a land of cheap apartment blocks and shopping malls, where a certain material comfort reigns without the support of culture or social cohesion. 
For these refugees, moving from a socialist to a capitalist system means discovering that they are free not only to succeed but also to fail. The most successful are those, like the store clerk, who seem able to leave their Cuban identities behind and become cogs in the American economic machine. 
"I am a sculptor," one refugee says as we watch him work on an elaborate wood carving. "This category doesn't exist here. But I could always be a handyman."
"Balseros" was completed with the aid of the screenwriter David Trueba ("Vengo," 2000; "Two Much," 1996), whose compositional skills no doubt helped to spin the seven different strands of the story into a coherent and emotionally satisfying tale. But it remains a documentary at heart, full of astonishing glimpses of human resiliency that have nothing to do with artfulness and everything to do with patience, persistence and sympathy.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Stocks Rise on News From Iraq and High-Tech Industry

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, underpinned by solid earnings from companies like Texas Instruments and spurred by reports that Saddam Hussein's two sons were killed in a gun battle with United States troops in Iraq.
 The market took off in late morning on initial reports that the sons, Uday and Qusay, might have been killed. The reports, later confirmed by the United States military, appeared to soothe fears that persistent unrest in Iraq could hinder the still-fragile economic recovery at home. 
 "People were just concerned that it's costing us quite a bit in money and in lives -- a lot more than people were expecting after it was officially declared over," said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of the United States equity group at Deutsche Bank Private Banking. "This type of news we had today doesn't put an end to it, but it lessens the perception that this thing will drag on." 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.76 points, or 0.68 percent, to 9,158.45, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 9.31 points, or 0.95 percent, to 988.11. The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 24.69 points, or 1.47 percent, to 1,706.10.
Traders also said the market's drop over the last week was luring bargain hunters. The ability of the S. &P. to stay above the technically significant 975 mark added to investors' confidence.
"It's a combination of things: a technical bounce, decent earnings in the tech space and decent earnings in the financial sector," said David Memmott, head of listed block trading at Morgan Stanley. "You've had four out of the past five days down. We're just seeing a bit of a snapback."
Aside from the news out of Iraq, Wall Street focused on earnings statements. After bidding up stocks for the last four months, investors are scrutinizing companies' quarterly results for signs that an economic upswing is firmly under way.
Texas Instruments rose after it reported quarterly sales and earnings that surpassed its lowered outlook from a month ago, helped by a recovery in wireless sales. Its shares jumped 7.7 percent, or $1.37, to $19.25.
Semiconductor equipment stocks were among the big gainers of the day after Lehman raised its rating on a number of the sector's stocks. Applied Materials rose 89 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $18.76. Novellus Systems gained $1.76, or 5.1 percent, to $36.31. Lam Research rose $1.05, or 5.2 percent, to $21.34.
Countrywide Financial, a mortgage lender, also surged after it said its quarterly earnings doubled as low interest rates prompted Americans to refinance their homes in record numbers, and it said full-year earnings would top Wall Street estimates. Its shares rose $4.60, or 7 percent, to $70.32.
Shares of Colgate-Palmolive rose after the company said its second-quarter earnings increased 10 percent, as new products and the weaker dollar lifted sales. Colgate shares gained 30 cents to close at $56.60.
In a Treasuries market suffering from a technically oversold condition, prices rose and yields, which move in the opposite direction, eased.
The Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, said in an interview on CNBC that he was not inclined to revive the issuance of 30-year bonds, tamping down speculation the long bond would return amid burgeoning federal budget deficits.
"I think we've crossed that bridge in the sense that we've determined that the 30-year is an instrument that raises our borrowing costs and gives us less flexibility," Mr. Snow said. "So we're more inclined to borrow lower down on the yield curve."
By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 22/32, to 96 2/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.12 percent from 4.20 percent on Monday. And the 30-year bond gained 23/32, to 104 30/32. Its yield fell to 5.04 percent from 5.09 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

HEADLINE: For Every Child, a Stake in America 

BYLINE:  By Ray Boshara and Michael Sherraden; Ray Boshara is a program director at the New America Foundation. Michael Sherraden is professor of social work at Washington University in St. Louis.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain came to Washington last week to bolster President Bush against his critics on Iraq. Let's hope the two leaders found a moment to discuss domestic policy as well -- particularly Mr. Blair's effort to give every child a stake in Britain's economic future. 
 Each British baby born after last Sept. 1 will receive a trust fund worth at least $400, and up to $800 for the poorest one-third of children. The government will make smaller supplementary payments when the child turns 5, 11 and 16 years old -- and relatives or friends can contribute limited amounts tax-free over the years. Add to this the magic of compound interest, and the account could be worth $7,000 when it matures on the child's 18th birthday. In large part, the idea is to help the 16 million Britons -- out of 60 million -- who have no savings or equity at all to join the middle class. 
 Mr. Blair's initiative is the latest example of a concept that political scientists call "stakeholding." In postwar Japan, land was redistributed to millions of farmers, laying the foundation for the country's economic renaissance. Singapore has achieved one of the highest rates of savings and home ownership in the world largely because of laws requiring workers to put a portion of their earnings (and making employers contribute a matching amount) into a trust called the Central Provident Fund. And in the United States, a quarter of adults today can trace their family legacy of asset ownership to the Homestead Act that, beginning under Abraham Lincoln, awarded land in the American West to those pioneers with the courage to settle it. 
Why not, then, some version of stakeholding here in the United States, a Homestead Act for the 21st century? This country could certainly use it. The poorest 60 percent of Americans collectively owns less than 5 percent of the nation's wealth; one-quarter of white children and half of nonwhite children grow up in households with no resources at all for investment.
A United States version of baby bonds would have the political advantage of not being based on the politics of resentment -- soaking the rich to help the poor is an idea most Americans reject -- but on the politics of opportunity; that is, creating a larger middle class. In fact, members of Congress from both parties have in recent years proposed versions of retirement savings accounts for all children.
Here's how such a system might work in the United States. Each of the four million babies born every year would receive a deposit in an American stakeholder account. Initial deposits could range from, say, $1,000 to $6,000. Yes, it would be difficult to free up this money in a time of deficits, but as a long-term investment it would be money well spent.
Unlike Mr. Blair's baby bonds, which can be spent on anything after the recipient reaches age 18, Bush baby bonds would be restricted to higher education or technical training, a small business or a first home, or they could be put aside for retirement.
While all Americans would participate, it would be of the greatest benefit those born in low-income families, who have the greatest need for lifetime asset accumulation. It doesn't take an army of economists to know that society as a whole reaps huge rewards when we have more owners, savers, taxpayers and entrepreneurs -- and fewer people depending on the state, their communities and others for their livelihood and well-being.
Over the next decade, the United States may well spend $100 billion or more to give the Iraqi people, for the first time, a real stake in their society -- without doubt a worthy investment. But as our attention inevitably shifts back to domestic economic security, we should consider a new level of stakeholding in America as well.

HEADLINE: LETTER FROM THE MIDDLE EAST; 
With U.S. in Neighborhood, Syria Eases Its Grip

BYLINE:  By Dexter Filkins 

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria 

 BODY:
Before the war in Iraq, one of the oft-heard arguments put forth by the war's proponents was that an invasion of Iraq would break governments like this one.
 The government of President Bashar al-Assad, the scion of a party dynasty that has ruled this country for 40 years, was not freely elected. Human rights groups say its prisons contain hundreds of political prisoners. The American government says it sponsors terrorism. 
 Put 150,000 American troops and a democracy in Iraq, the argument went, and leaders like Mr. Assad, whose country sits on Iraq's western border, would quickly conclude that they needed to loosen their grip.
It is not easy to take the measure of public opinion in a society as closely watched as this one, but most Syrians heard the recent American demands made on Syria. One Damascus businessman, who said he routinely paid bribes to secure government contracts, said he thought the government had begun to reform itself here in part to keep the Americans at bay. 
"When the Americans are breathing down your neck, you start moving," he said. 
But the reality in Syria is perhaps more complicated than mere cause and effect, and the future may hold something less than a democratic contagion. Take the recent experience of two men, Ali Firzat and Haitham Maleh. 
In January, Mr. Maleh, a longtime human rights campaigner who spent seven years in prison in the 1980's, was charged with a number of politically related crimes. The charges, including forming an illegal organization and printing without a license, seemed intended not so much to crush him as to harass him. None carried a sentence of more than three years. 
In the seven months that followed, and as the Americans moved to destroy the government of Saddam Hussein, the Syrian government began a number of political and economic changes. Leaders of the all powerful Baath Party ordered their members to stay out of the day-to-day running of the bureaucracy. Mr. Assad ruled that Syrians could hold foreign currency. He even chucked the military uniforms worn by Syrian schoolchildren in favor of pink and blue ones. 
"It is Bashar's perestroika," said Walid Jumblatt, a veteran Lebanese political leader and an ally of the government. "He knows he has to change." 
Mr. Maleh, 72, was quick to seize on one of the most significant decrees, an amnesty for anyone charged with a crime that carried a sentence of less than three years. Although the decree seemed aimed at freeing petty criminals, Mr. Maleh argued that he qualified, too. 
Ever fearless, Mr. Maleh stood before an anonymous judge seated on a high bench in a Syrian military court and made his case.
"The law requires that the charges against me be dropped," he said. 
The judge, a uniformed officer with a short mustache, offered no comment. But he considered Mr. Maleh's argument, nodded and, last Tuesday, threw out the case. Mr. Maleh walked free. 
But even Mr. Maleh did not take his victory as a sign that a new era was dawning. "All these changes are cosmetic," he said.
Syrian officials insisted that the changes ordered by Mr. Assad, as well as the dropping of Mr. Maleh's case, had nothing to do with the recent American pressure on Syria or the invasion of Iraq. 
"Americans tend to see things only in their own terms," Bouthaina Shaaban, a government spokeswoman, said in an interview. "These changes would have happened anyway." 
In fact, the limits of the Syrian experiment are already becoming clear. The hypersensitive atmosphere created by the war appears to have prompted the Syrian government to crack down on at least some of its enemies. 
For years, Mr. Firzat's political cartoons survived despite their merciless -- and often hilarious -- ridiculing of Syrian officialdom. He managed this by fashioning his cartoons deftly enough to make their point, but obliquely enough to allow him to deny any ill intent. Syrians got the joke. 
But the Syrian government's tolerance for Mr. Firzat, 51, came to end, as did his newspaper, The Light Holder, when he took up the subject of the American invasion of Iraq.
The trouble began on March 29, Mr. Firzat said, when he published a cartoon showing a man clearly intended to be a hysterical Mr. Hussein trying to rally a crowd of Iraqis. The Iraqis standing before him were hungry, tattered and afraid. 
"They want to steal your palaces!" the man is shouting, "your companies, your wealth and your oil!" 
That same week, the Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, said publicly that he wanted America to lose the war, and as the cartoon appeared, American soldiers were moving toward Baghdad. 
Three days after the cartoon appeared, Tishrin, a government newspaper, published an extraordinary attack on Mr. Firzat. "Have dollars and dinars become more valuable than the blood and tears of children?" the headline asked.
Soon demonstrators were gathering outside Mr. Firzat's office, and the people who printed The Light Holder began, one by one, to refuse. A handful, intimidated, said they would consider doing so only if Mr. Firzat obtained a letter from the Syrian officials authorizing it. 
"It was every man for himself," Mr. Firzat said. "People were afraid." 
After weeks of haggling, Mr. Firzat said the government finally agreed to give him such a letter but would only guarantee that the newspaper would be printed a week after it was ready. Mr. Firzat, realizing there was little point in trying to sell a newspaper that was a week old, finally gave up. He has not printed since. 
"I don't succumb to political pressure," Mr. Firzat said, "but I couldn't get the paper printed." 
Ms. Shaaban, the Syrian government spokeswoman, rejected Mr. Firzat's story, asserting that The Light Holder went out of business because Syrians did not like it. 
"I really didn't read it," she said. "It was shallow." 
In the same interview, Ms. Shaaban offered a clue to Syria's future and possibly to the futures of Mr. Firzat and Mr. Maleh. The model was not Europe or America but, Ms. Shaaban said, China, a place where the economy was increasingly market oriented but where one party still held absolute power. 
"We will take the lead," Ms. Shaaban said of the Baath Party. 
Her reasoning came as no surprise to Mr. Maleh. As long as one party retains all the power, he said, it will always be free to go back on its promises, whether they are codified in law or not. 
"There is no law here," he said. "Only the dictators."

HEADLINE: Bush Team Faces Widespread Pressure to Act on Liberia 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22 

 BODY:
Three weeks after signaling it might send American troops to Liberia as part of an international peacekeeping operation, the Bush administration today disputed any suggestion that it was deliberately delaying a decision even as the Liberian capital of Monrovia endured another violent day.
 Faced with growing pressure from Liberians, the United Nations and other countries, administration officials sought to tamp down speculation among diplomats and analysts that President Bush was caught in an internal dispute about whether the United States should put combat forces on the ground in Liberia. Administration officials also countered speculation that Mr. Bush was reluctant to risk American lives in Liberia because of qualms among some Republicans in Congress. 
 Officials said the administration was pressing both the rebels who have pushed into Monrovia and the forces loyal to President Charles G. Taylor to abide by the cease-fire they agreed to last month. The officials said they also continued to work with other West African nations on how to deploy a peacekeeping operation that would involve or be supported by the United States military.
One administration official said the main issue now was working out with the Economic Community of West African States, the umbrella group for governments in the region, what roles the African military forces were capable of playing.
Although there have been differences between the State Department and the Pentagon over the size and nature of any United States peacekeeping mission, the official said the internal differences were not playing a big role in President Bush's consideration.
But proponents of American military involvement in peacekeeping harshly criticized the administration, saying it was moving too slowly.
Some analysts said the United States had delayed so long in making a decision that the rebel forces had concluded that there was nothing to stop them from making another attempt to seize Monrovia and force Mr. Taylor from power.
"I'm becoming increasingly cynical," said Susan E. Rice, assistant secretary of state for African affairs in the Clinton administration. "The dithering and delaying, particularly after raising expectations in Liberia and throughout Africa and in the international community, is bordering on the criminally irresponsible. I don't understand what they're waiting for."
Mr. Bush has said a number of times in recent weeks that the United States would support a peacekeeping effort by the West African nations, but that he had not decided on the size or nature of any American deployment. The president held extensive discussions about the peacekeeping operation during his trip to Africa this month.
Even analysts who said they were sympathetic to the administration's approach suggested that Mr. Bush would have to make a decision soon.
"We've been missing moments in Liberia since 1989, so to suddenly hold this administration responsible for another night of bad news from Monrovia is a little bit much," said Chester A. Crocker, who was assistant secretary of state for African affairs in the Reagan administration.
But, Mr. Crocker added, "More days and nights like this will put the administration in a bind because it will inadvertently create the impression that it's changed its mind from the expectations that were built up during the president's trip."
Mr. Bush has had to contend not only with Pentagon reluctance to commit substantial numbers of troops to Liberia at a time when the military is already stretched thin, but also with nervousness among Republicans in Congress about putting American lives on the line in Africa.
One Republican foreign policy aide acknowledged that Liberia's historic ties to the United States and the expanding crisis there would probably result in intervention by the United States, though "the enthusiasm for an extended U.S. military role in Liberia is dim."
The aide said he expected Congress to approve a deployment of "hundreds, not thousands of troops" and only in a protection role that backed up the West African forces.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has been talking daily with Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general. Mr. Annan and Mr. Powell have been negotiating with West African leaders to deploy about 1,500 troops -- most of them Nigerian -- who would re-establish stability. The plan under discussion then calls for the African troops to be joined by as many as 2,000 American troops. 
The plan assumes that Mr. Taylor will make good on his promises to step down and leave the country, and that the American presence will be phased out quickly and replaced by United Nations peacekeeping forces from other nations.
In an interview today with the BBC, Olara A. Otunnu, an under secretary general of the United Nations, said the organization was seeking to designate the peacekeeping operation as one "that can take on those who are violating an agreed cease-fire" and therefore can be established as "a more muscular operation." Mr. Otunnu said that the West African nations were seeking financial support from Washington, and that he was optimistic there "may be some important and positive announcements about the U.S. decision." The Pentagon has moved an amphibious group with 2,000 marines through the Red Sea toward the Mediterranean, and they could steam down Africa's west coast to Liberia.
Mr. Powell and Walter H. Kansteiner, the assistant secretary for African affairs, are scheduled to brief the Congressional foreign affairs committees, at the invitation of lawmakers, on Thursday.
Mr. Bush first involved himself in Liberia last month by calling for Mr. Taylor to step down. Mr. Taylor's ambiguous pledges to leave have complicated the administration's stance. Mr. Taylor has been accused by a tribunal created by the United Nations and Sierra Leone of crimes against humanity in connection with the war in Sierra Leone.
A successful peacekeeping operation will depend partly on "getting the circumstances on the ground" in which Mr. Taylor "is extracted or extracts himself," Mr. Crocker said. "He's as slimy as an eel."

HEADLINE: Compromise Plan Is Offered To Widen Child Tax Credit 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22 

 BODY:
Senate Republicans offered a compromise to the House today intended to end the stalemate blocking an expansion of the child tax credit to low-income families, but Democrats said the proposal's benefits for wealthier families were too expensive to pass.
 The offer came with an increase in political activity just four days before the government will begin mailing $400-per-child checks to 25 million middle-income families eligible to receive the tax credit. On Thursday, President Bush is scheduled to visit a federal office in Philadelphia that is printing the checks, using the opportunity to remind voters that the checks are to stimulate the economy. 
 Democrats plan a series of protests on and off the floors of Congress this week to demonstrate their anger that 6.5 million low-income families were left out of the economic stimulus package and will not be receiving the checks. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said members of her party would make this "the week from hell" for Republicans. On Wednesday, as part of one protest, 700 children are scheduled to descend on the Capitol to make a similar point. 
Today's compromise proposal, made by the three Republican senators who are negotiating with the House on the credits, would give the $400-per-child credits to the 6.5 million minimum-wage families, a provision that would cost $3.5 billion. But the plan would also spend $20 billion to give increased credits to 25 million middle- and upper-income families from 2005 to 2007. The increase, to $1,000 from $600, is now scheduled to expire in 2005.
The proposal would also increase the tax credit through 2007 for millions of families making more than $110,000, a measure that would cost about $10 billion to $12 billion, Republican tax officials said. The full child credit is currently not available to most families at that income level.
The overall proposal would cost about $50 billion during the next 10 years, which is much more expensive than the $10 billion bill passed overwhelmingly by the Senate seven weeks ago. But House Republicans, who object to giving the credit to low-income families who do not pay federal income tax, have insisted on a much broader package of tax cuts for middle- and upper-income families that would cost $82 billion.
Although today's proposal moves much closer to the House bill, its size is likely to raise serious problems for many Democrats and moderate Republicans in the Senate. Most senators have said they want any tax credit package to be paid for with increases in fees so it does not raise the federal deficit, already at record levels. The costs of today's proposal would be only partly offset by fees, and thus may not be able to summon a majority in the Senate.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the principal author of the plan, acknowledged that a majority of the Senate did not want the package to add to the deficit, but he said it was necessary to put an offer on the table to get the stalled talks moving.
"Nothing will get done if we don't sit down and talk," Mr. Grassley, chairman of the Finance Committee, said. "At least it's less expensive than what the House passed."
He added that he hoped to get the issue settled by the end of the week, when the House leaves for its August recess.
That seemed unlikely, though, after Senate Democrats and House Republicans alike expressed disagreement with the plan.
"This is not an excuse to increase the debt on our children," said Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas and the chief proponent of the expanded credits. "It's an opportunity to provide something fair and equitable to the 12 million children who belong to working families in this country."
Although President Bush has said he wants the House and Senate to reach agreement on providing the credits to low-income families, the White House has not yet moved to broker a compromise, despite weeks of political criticism from religious groups, Democrats and advocates for children. Almost every day for the last two weeks, House Democrats have introduced a measure that would prod the conference committee to accept the original Senate bill, but Republicans have defeated each resolution.
Democrats have said that House Republicans know full well that the Senate will not pass another tax package this year that adds to the deficit, and they have accused Republicans of throwing in the other tax breaks as a kind of poison pill to prevent the entire package from being passed. House leaders say that if the Democrats want to give credits to people who do not pay income taxes, they must also be willing to cut taxes further for those who do.

HEADLINE: The Brothers Grim 

 BODY:
Few Iraqis will mourn the deaths of Saddam Hussein's two sons, Uday and Qusay. Like their father, they were mercurial, cruel killers who terrorized and plundered their country so they could live in imperial style. The word from American commanders in Iraq yesterday that the Hussein brothers had been killed in a firefight with American troops in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul was the most encouraging news out of Iraq in weeks. If American forces can now track down Saddam Hussein himself, Iraqis may finally begin to believe that the dictator and his clan will not someday storm back into power. 
 That Saddam Hussein and his sons somehow managed to escape Baghdad and elude American searchers for so long has been one of the war's many surprises. Washington's inability to find some of its most prominent enemies -- Osama bin Laden, Mullah Muhammad Omar and Saddam Hussein -- has been frustrating for all Americans. The capture of Mr. Hussein would be especially helpful in pacifying Iraq. 
 Yesterday's shootout leaves many intriguing questions unanswered. It is not clear where the Hussein brothers were hiding for the past 15 weeks, or what role, if any, they played in the attacks that have killed 40 American soldiers since May 1. If they were moving from house to house in close proximity to their father, Saddam Hussein may be in Mosul as well. The choice of that city as a hiding place by the brothers was somewhat surprising because of Mosul's location, near the Kurdish region where the Hussein family is particularly hated. 
The two Hussein brothers were essential pillars of the Baathist dictatorship. Though not as powerful as their father, they were his equals in brutality, well practiced in crimes against their own people.
Qusay, calm and coldblooded, headed the Special Republican Guard. As one of his father's major security lieutenants, he helped organize thousands of executions and disappearances of regime opponents. Uday, infamous for fierce rages, was the organizer of the Fedayeen Saddam death squads, made up of criminals who were freed to kill for the regime. He was also known for torturing athletes during his tenure as head of Iraq's Olympic Committee.
Much more than the capture of Saddam Hussein is needed to turn around what has so far been a tense and troubled occupation. Electricity and other vital services have to be restored on a round-the-clock basis throughout Iraq. Reliable Iraqi police and security services need to be trained and vetted, new jobs found for the unemployed, and the oil industry restored to full production. 
Paul Bremer III, Washington's chief civilian administrator in Iraq, plans to unveil today the most specific plan to date for reviving Iraq's economy and public institutions, complete with target goals for the next 60 and 120 days. Realizing his hopes will require more money than Washington originally planned and the active support of the Iraqi people. The demise of the Hussein brothers should make it easier to win that support.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. Increases Earnings 13%, Exceeding Analysts' Estimates 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 22 

 BODY:
United Parcel Service reported today that its second-quarter profit rose 13 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The company cited strong growth in its international business. 
 U.P.S. earned $692 million, or 61 cents a share, compared with $611 million, or 54 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
 The earnings included a gain of $14 million, or 1 cent a share, from the sale of a small subsidiary, UPS Mail Technologies.
Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call were expecting earnings of 59 cents a share, including the gain from the asset sale. 
Revenue totaled $8.23 billion, up 7 percent from the $7.68 billion reported in the 2002 quarter.
U.P.S., based in Atlanta, said international revenue increased nearly 20 percent in the quarter. Worldwide export volume climbed 6.2 percent, led by a 15 percent gain in Asia.
D. Scott Davis, the chief financial officer, said the company was performing better than the rest of the economy. He also credited a rebranding initiative for increasing profit.
U.P.S. derives most of its $33 billion in annual revenue from small-package deliveries in the United States. But overseas shipments, finance and supply-chain management are growing, and that is where executives think the future lies.
Mr. Davis said that U.P.S. this quarter expected a volume gain of 2 percent to 3 percent in domestic business, international operating margins to improve and earnings of 58 cents to 62 cents. Analysts forecast 60 cents. 
In trading today, shares of U.P.S. fell 56 cents, to $64.23.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS: U.S.O.C. Analysis; 
Coloradan Would Bar U.S.O.C. Office Move

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
He says there is no proof of a plot to snatch the United States Olympic Committee's headquarters from Colorado Springs. But Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado is certain that "people in Olympic circles in New York" want to steal away with some part of the dysfunctional organization.
 "I'm convinced," he said yesterday from Washington. "I can't elaborate. Some people are wearing two hats." 
 He added: "It's not my responsibility to get to the bottom of this. It's my job to preserve the U.S.O.C. for Colorado Springs."
Jay Kriegel, executive director of NYC2012, who is a central member of Olympic circles in New York, declined to comment.
Campbell has attacked the Olympic committee for its chaotic, self-interested, profligate ways and has helped lead the drive for reform. But his role has been ad hoc. He was invited to help the fix-the-U.S.O.C. effort by the Senate Commerce Committee, and he has done so with relish: a 1964 judo Olympian, Campbell has been feistier than his Senate Republican colleagues John McCain of Arizona and Ted Stevens of Alaska.
Just as McCain's reform bill was introduced last week, Campbell blocked it with a procedural hold and vowed to relent only when he gets what he wants: legislative protection that no part of the U.S.O.C.'s Colorado Springs complex will go anywhere, neither its executive offices nor its training center. 
But the Commerce Committee is resistant to make policy over office location, being eager as it is to legislate the size of a new board (to nine elected directors) and the creation of an assembly, which would be made up of nearly all of the 124 members of the nearly extinct U.S.O.C. board.
"I want more than reasonable assurance that it won't move," Campbell said, allowing only that he would not mind New York's having a "satellite office."
Campbell said he and McCain had not formally met on any compromise language in the bill that "will satisfy Colorado Springs and me." He said he would not support language that would let a supermajority, or 60 percent, of the proposed assembly decide on any move.
"I want specific language," he said.
Whatever threat is perceived by Campbell has not been apparent in the debate over how to alter the course of the floundering, bloated Olympic committee.
Recent reports on reforming the U.S.O.C. -- one by an internal task force, the other by an external, independent commission of five members, four of them from the New York area -- made no mention of moving the headquarters.
"I don't know where this is coming from," Harvey Schiller, a member of the commission, said yesterday from France.
Donna de Varona, also a commission member, said of Campbell: "He's running for re-election. There are politics other than Olympic politics. It's really unfortunate. It's a tragedy that it has to be an Olympian."
Only one U.S.O.C. board member, Anita DeFrantz, said in Senate testimony earlier this year that the organization's main offices, not its training center, should be moved to a major city. "I've said that it would be important to have the executive offices -- and this is other people's opinions, too -- in a major metropolitan area," DeFrantz said yesterday from Los Angeles. 
De Varona said the benefits of such a move would be in recruiting executive talent and in marketing. But the commission did not deal with the idea.
Campbell called it fallacious to believe that Olympic sponsors would prefer visiting New York, where some of them are located, over Colorado Springs. In travelogue style, he asked, "Do people want to stay in the sweltering concrete canyons of New York or visit the beautiful mountains and real canyons of Colorado Springs?"
The senator's initiative has led Mayor Lionel Rivera of Colorado Springs to start a letter-writing campaign to Congress (to help save what would be lost of the $315 million local sports economy if U.S.O.C. jobs flee), and prompted a coalition of business groups to hire a Capitol Hill lobbyist.
Rocky Scott, president of the Greater Colorado Springs Economic Development Corporation, said he was unfazed that Campbell's evidence of a plot is slender because the U.S.O.C.'s ethical house of cards made what is denied look believable.
"How long have you tracked the U.S.O.C.?" Scott said. "There are more subplots there than a 'Hill Street Blues' episode. The things people say may communicate less than what they don't say. There are denials, half-denials, and you can get any answer you want depending on the level of confidentiality."
Although Campbell is wary of "covetous eyes" that he said New York had cast upon the U.S.O.C. and its assets, he held a fund-raiser last week that included former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
"I see no irony in that at all," Campbell said.

HEADLINE: After Mad Cow Report, Export Ban Hits Home 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, July 23 

 BODY:
Two months after more than 30 countries closed their borders to Canadian beef, one business after another in High River, a small town south of Calgary, Alberta, is feeling the pinch.
 First, the truckers who used to carry cattle across the United States border, a three-hour drive away, stopped showing up at the local Heritage Inn. Darren Barker, the hotel's office administrator, estimated the loss in food, liquor and lodging at almost 2,000 Canadian dollars ($1,422) a month. 
 Then, the Cargill meatpacking plant, High River's biggest employer, laid off 375 of its 2,000 workers. "Any time you lay off that amount of people, it can affect the economy of a small town," said Bob Barker -- no relation to Darren -- the owner of the Photo Encounters camera store, who estimated that his business was down 15 percent from a year ago. 
Beef exports came to an abrupt halt on May 20 after the carcass of a single cow from a remote ranch in Northern Alberta tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.
As a precaution, food inspectors have ordered the slaughter of more than 2,000 cattle. 
Canadian and international animal health experts say they have found no other cases of mad cow disease, nor any evidence that the disease has entered the food supply or exports. In recent weeks, Canada has mounted a vigorous diplomatic campaign to persuade its trading partners that Canadian beef is safe.
But these efforts have so far failed. Japan has warned that if the United States reopens its borders to Canadian beef, it may restrict imports of American beef. Prices of cattle futures in the United States are up in recent weeks as traders weigh the prospect that supplies from Canada may be cut off for a while.
With exports of beef and cattle bringing in about 4 billion Canadian dollars ($2.84 billion) last year, or 60 percent of the industry's revenue, the ban is cutting a wide swath, especially in the prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
One of the industry's biggest headaches so far has been trying to find a market for the tripe, shank, chuck and other types of meat that are sold mainly in Asia and are of little interest to North American consumers.
Brian Read, general manager of Colbex-Levinoff Meats of Kitchener, Ontario, said his company had an inventory of these cuts valued at 2.5 million Canadian dollars ($1.78 million) before the mad cow scare struck. "On May 20, it was worth zero," said Mr. Read, who is also president of the Canadian Meat Council, a packers group. "It will end up as fodder."
At the other end of the production chain, Stephen Hughes, the third generation to tend his family's 5,000-acre ranch in the foothills of the Rockies, recently sold a dozen cows that are not weaning calves this summer. "It should have been an eight- or nine-thousand dollar check, and it was only three," he said. "We're price takers in this business to begin with, but I never would have guessed our industry was this fragile."
Even though the beef industry has lost more than half its market, the damage has so far been relatively limited.
Contrasting Canada's situation with the outbreak of mad cow disease in Britain in the mid-1990's, Kevin Grier, senior analyst at the George Morris Centre, an agrifood research group in Guelph, Ontario, said, "The good news is that Canadians are still eating beef."
Burger King's Canadian unit said last week that it had not bought any foreign beef in the last month, and was moving toward using only Canadian meat for its burgers. Meanwhile, the beef industry is bombarding consumers with recipes, and supermarkets are offering deep discounts, mostly on ground beef.
The federal government and the provinces have softened the blow with a program, valued at 480 million Canadian dollars ($341 million), to partly compensate producers for the drop in prices. The program kicks in when cattle prices fall below 1.05 Canadian dollars a pound, roughly where they were when exports were halted. At a price of 70 cents a pound, the government makes up 84 percent of producers' lost income. Alberta added another 60 million Canadian dollars to the program this week.
The compensation program "is the only reason we're going to be in business once this thing is over," said Bernard Kotelko, president of Highland Feeders, one of the biggest feedlots in Northern Alberta.
According to Mr. Kotelko and others, the timing of the mad cow outbreak has also helped cushion the loss of export markets, at least for now. Many feedlots took advantage of high prices last spring to ship cattle to meatpacking plants. "When this disaster happened, the industry was not in a big rush to market cattle," said Mr. Grier, the analyst. With calves born last spring not ready to be shipped to feedlots for another month or two, "the rancher is not on the front line right now."
Furthermore, a severe drought on the prairies last year led many ranchers to cull their herds. More young cows than usual were shipped from Alberta to the United States in 2002 and early this year.
Highland Feeders had about 25,000 cattle in its feedlots when the border was closed, compared to the normal 35,000 at that time of year. Mr. Kotelko said that, since May, Highland's cattle population has fallen further, to 18,000, as the company seeks to match supply with demand.
But with no sign of exports resuming, the industry is starting to grapple with the prospect of a more serious crunch. "If the borders are not going to open, we as a country have to look at our population of livestock," Mr. Read said. "We have to look at a reduction of herds."
A newspaper reported today that Alberta would soon begin a program to discourage ranchers and feedlot operators from flooding slaughterhouses with cattle in coming months.
Mr. Hughes, the rancher, said that with his wife expecting their third child and with no chance of cutting expenses, "there's nothing but worry and uncertainty." He said that he may have to turn to his bank for help: "What would anyone else do if their income was cut by at least half with the same living expenses?"

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Telling Children Not to Inhale Junk Food, Either

BYLINE:  By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
HECTOR BATISTA wants to stamp out obesity in the New York City schools. He is not an intimidating figure. He is rather unassuming and low key. So one wonders exactly how he will accomplish this feat: persuading schoolchildren to give up sugary drinks and high-fat treats.
 But as the executive vice president of the American Cancer Society in the New York City region, Mr. Batista is known for being quietly aggressive, somewhat like a gnat. He swarms around an issue, directing his staff of 215 employees and 2,000 volunteers in the city, in Westchester County and on Long Island, to flood the offices of political leaders with letters and telephone calls. 
 In the case of tobacco, Mr. Batista was a powerful voice exhorting City Hall and leaders in Albany to ban smoking in most restaurants and public places. They have. Now, with the New York City Council considering a bill to ban the sale of junk food in the schools, he wants to keep up the momentum on obesity. 
"I don't plan to let go," Mr. Batista said from his Midtown office the other day, sipping a glass of orange juice and rattling off statistics. Did you know, he asks, that only 1 percent of Americans see the link between obesity and cancer? And did you know that 90,000 people die each year of obesity-related cancer, and that deaths from obesity could soon overtake those from smoking? For that reason, the society has intensified its advocacy efforts. 
A city survey released earlier this month found that nearly half the children in the public elementary schools are overweight, and that one in four is obese. The rate of obesity is 31 percent among Hispanic children. Other studies indicate that obesity is rising faster among Hispanics than among any other group. 
"This is personal," Mr. Batista says, shaking his head. "It's a community close to my heart." He celebrates his Latino heritage. His father is Dominican, a musician who has a salsa and merengue band; his mother is Puerto Rican. But he says some cultural habits are simply getting the best of his people. "Latinos eating vegetables? Come on," he says, raising his hands in frustration. "We don't eat vegetables. It's rice and beans and meat. It's very natural. We could do it every single day. It's about finding that balance." 
For the record, Mr. Batista is 5 foot 8 and weighs 184 pounds. He says he wants to lose 10 pounds, that he is about 40 pounds heavier than he was 19 years ago, when he married his wife, Frances, an administrator at a brokerage firm. They live with their two children in Park Slope, Brooklyn. As far as his family goes, it is his 8-year-old daughter, Katrina, whom he worries about. (He describes his 12-year-old son, Gian, as a finicky eater.) He says she could live off chicken nuggets and fries. 
"I have to get my hands around it before it becomes a problem," he says. "I want to make sure when my daughter looks at junk food, she looks at it the same way she looks at tobacco, totally turned off by it." 
In his large office, family photographs line the shelves. There are photographs of Katrina, as a baby, and one of her now, a girl in a white communion dress.
Mr. Batista, who has a trim mustache, graying hair and an old-fashioned manner, lights up when he mentions Katrina. He says it is not so easy, even as a top cancer official, to persuade a daughter to eat well.
"She melts me," he says. "She says, 'Daddy, why are you punishing me? I'm your princess.' "
As for reaching a broader audience, he wants schools to adopt a 10-point plan to promote better nutrition and more exercise, including a period for stretching, replacing fund-raising efforts that use candy with ones using fruit or gift wrap, and, of course, banning junk food. 
Mr. Batista knows that the schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, has already stated his intention to remove junk food from vending machines, without City Council action. Even so, Mr. Batista says legislation is needed to ensure that change outlasts a political administration.
He has also asked State Assemblyman Felix W. Ortiz, a Democrat from Brooklyn, to hold hearings in each borough on legislation he is sponsoring to place a 1 percent tax on junk food and soft drinks. 
"If we don't address this issue now, we are setting up the next cancer victim," Mr. Batista says.
MR. BATISTA, who received a master's degree in public administration from New York University, has spent most of his career in public service. He was the chief of staff and deputy commissioner in the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, and the economic development adviser to the former Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden. He joined the cancer society two years ago from Jeffrey M. Brown Associates, a real estate development company that builds stores. 
From where he sits now, Mr. Batista says he will know he is winning the war against obesity when young people are as upset about it as he is.
"They're the best advocate," he says. "It's not until the kids begin to fight this that we're hitting close to home."

HEADLINE: Kodak Reports Lower Profits And May Cut 6,000 Workers 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The Eastman Kodak Company, still grappling with ways to bring its costs in line with its shrinking film revenue, said yesterday that it would eliminate as many as 6,000 jobs.
 The announcement came even as the company said that its second-quarter earnings were much higher than it had predicted as recently as mid-June and that its digital-photography and health care-related businesses were performing well. 
 Much of the pleasant surprise apparently stemmed from an abatement of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Asia, a lower tax rate and other external factors. Kodak's mainstay film business continues to decline and, while its revenue from digital cameras and related printing and archiving services is rising, profits have yet to catch up. 
"Film sales will recover when the economy bounces back, but the impact of digital substitution will make that hard to see in our results," Daniel A. Carp, Kodak's chairman, said during a conference call. 
For the latest quarter, Kodak earned $112 million, or 39 cents a share, compared with $284 million, or 97 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales were flat at $3.35 billion. Kodak said that net income in the second half would be 25 to 65 cents a share -- a sharp drop from $1.54 in 2002.
The report was not entirely bleak. The job cuts, which would reduce the work force by up to 9 percent, could add 80 cents a share to 2004 earnings. Moreover, Mr. Carp noted, the software and services that underlie much of Kodak's growing digital business do not require big manufacturing plants.
"We now know that digital adoption accounts for the great majority of our sales decline in the United States, and we are adjusting costs for that reality," Mr. Carp said.
Still, some analysts wonder whether, even now, Mr. Carp recognizes how deep a threat the shift to digital photography represents.
"Carp finally is acknowledging that film is a no-growth business," said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst for Goldman Sachs, who has a rating of underperform on Kodak shares. "He is adjusting the cost structure accordingly, but the question remains, is he adjusting it enough?"
Even Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Buckman, Buckman & Reid who is among a dwindling few giving Kodak shares a buy rating, is impatient.
"They are contracting out some manufacturing, but I want them to outsource all of it," he said. 
That would be sad news in Kodak's home base, Rochester, where more than half the job cuts will be made. 
"We've lost around 40,000 jobs in the last few years, so any new job loss is a shock to our nervous system," said William A. Johnson Jr., the city's mayor. Nonetheless, Mayor Johnson said he was "sad, but not angry," about the pending cuts. "Kodak is still our largest employer and a philanthropic force in our community, and anything they do to remain viable will eventually work to our benefit," he said.
That may not be equally true of shareholders, analysts say. Earlier this week, Kodak said it would spend more than $500 million to buy PracticeWorks, which sells information systems to dentists' offices. While few analysts take issue with Kodak's strategy of bolstering its fast-growing health imaging businesses, many are concerned that the acquisition's high price will cause debt to mount and threaten Kodak's $1.80 dividend.
"Maintaining that dividend is paramount," said David R. Giroux, an investment analyst at T. Rowe Price, which owns Kodak shares. Carol Levenson, director of research for the bond research firm Gimme Credit, was even more blunt. "By any measure this acquisition is a gamble," she said.
During the conference call, both Mr. Carp and Robert H. Brust, Kodak's chief financial officer, maintained that Kodak had ample cash and that its debt was manageable. They said dividend policies would be discussed, as usual, at a regularly scheduled September board meeting. "The company is in good, solid financial condition," Mr. Carp said. 
Analysts were not so easily mollified, though. Some even see a dark side to surpassing expectations. As recently as June 18, Kodak warned that second-quarter earnings from continuing operations would be 25 to 35 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, Kodak earned 60 cents.
"It makes you wonder about their internal controls and if they are constantly working with outdated numbers," said Charles L. Hill, director of research at Thomson First Call.
Mr. Brust, in an e-mail message, said that, because of factors like the SARS epidemic and the rate of technological change, it was "increasingly difficult to forecast in these volatile times."
Investors seem ready to give Kodak the benefit of the doubt. Kodak shares rose $2.27, to $26.86.

HEADLINE: Strong Financial Results at Roche and Gl axo 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LANGLEY 

DATELINE: BASEL, Switzerland, July 23 

 BODY:
The natural resistance of drug makers to the vagaries of economic ups and downs shone through today in the latest financial results from Roche of Switzerland and GlaxoSmithKline of Britain. Both reported substantial sales and earnings gains on the strength of their latest big drugs. 
 Coming two days after another Swiss-based drug giant, Novartis, announced its own strong showing, today's reports cheered drug investors in Europe, who bid up Glaxo shares 3.1 percent and Roche's 4.7 percent. 
 "This is an industry with defensive qualities," Richard Jarvis, a pharmaceutical analyst for Pictet & Company, said in a telephone interview from London. 
Two American drug makers that also reported results today, Wyeth and Schering-Plough, did not fare as well. Wyeth posted a 44 percent gain in earnings in the second quarter, but most of that came from asset sales, and the company warned that declining demand for hormone treatments would hurt its results next year; its stock fell 28 cents in New York, to $47.95.
Schering-Plough's results reflected the loss of patent protection for its allergy drug Claritin and generic competition with the successor drug, Clarinex. Schering's sales fell 17 percent in the second quarter from the period a year earlier. Its profit dropped 71 percent. Still, investors who had expected even worse news bid up the stock 78 cents, to $17.75.
For Roche, whose revenue in the first half rose 17 percent, to 13.8 billion Swiss francs, or $10.2 billion, the best news came from its pharmaceutical division, where newer drugs like MabThera, for treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Pegasys, for hepatitis, are recording robust gains in sales. 
The company's net income for the half fell 24 percent because of a steep decline in profits from financial investments and because last year's results included a one-time gain from the sale of a unit. Roche did not break out figures for the second quarter, but operating profit was up sharply in the half.
Glaxo said that it had reaped the benefits of cost-cutting and that generic competition for Augmentin, an antibiotic recently off patent protection, had not hurt as much as expected. "The market was impressed because sales didn't collapse," Mr. Jarvis said.
Roche's chief executive, Franz Humer, at a news conference here announcing the financial results, was asked about the company's plans to deal with a problem involving its diagnostic-test business, which contributes a growing share of revenue.
Many of Roche's diagnostic products depend on amino-acid-based technology licensed from Igen International of Gaithersburg, Md., but Roche and Igen have been fighting for years over royalties. On July 9, Igen won a court ruling allowing it to terminate the license. 
Roche confirmed on Tuesday that it was in talks to resolve the dispute by acquiring Igen. But Mr. Humer bristled at suggestions that the court ruling had given Igen the upper hand in the talks. "I will not be pressured into a deal that doesn't make sense," he said today. "I will not have a gun held to my head."
Roche can easily afford to buy Igen, whose market capitalization is about $900 million. But Mr. Humer, in a separate interview, said repeatedly that the deal depended on finding a fair price, adding: "I feel it is in the interest of both parties to see if a solution can be found. If it cannot be found at reasonable terms, we cannot do a deal." 
He also said that strong demand for two new drugs -- Fuzeon, the first of a new class of antiviral AIDS drugs, and Pegasys -- as well as the successful integration of Chugai Pharmaceuticals of Japan, which Roche bought last year, meant that the company was well on its way to meeting a target of 25 percent growth in the next two years. 
Analysts said another new drug nearing approval -- Avastin, for treating metastatic colorectal cancer -- had the potential to yield $1 billion a year in sales. 
By contrast, Glaxo has been quiet about its pipeline of new drugs, saying it will not discuss this in detail until December. Analysts speculated that the pipeline might now be relatively thin.
A promising Glaxo drug is Levitra, for erectile dysfunction, which is expected to be approved in the United States later this year. Glaxo bought the patent from Bayer of Germany. 
Roche has bought many of its headline drugs as well, including two from Genentech, the American biotechnology company in which Roche has a 59 percent stake.
"You have to remember that Roche's pipeline is really Genentech's pipeline," a London analyst said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
The Supreme Court finds the 'mushball middle' on affirmative action.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and a co-editor of The Journal of the European Economic Association. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
"WHEN we see a complicated, seemingly intractable problem," the comedian Al Franken once remarked about affirmative action, "we have the only really genuine, authentic human reaction you can have: we're confused."
 Supreme Court justices do not have the same luxury. 
 The justices were forced to take sides last month in the landmark cases involving admissions practices at the University of Michigan. Their rulings will likely satisfy Mr. Franken's quest to find the "mushball middle" when it comes to affirmative action. 
By a 5-4 margin, the court permitted the "narrowly tailored" use of race-conscious admissions policies used by the university's law school. The justices expressly prohibited the use of numerical quotas but ruled that race may be considered along with other factors on an individual basis if "serious, good faith consideration" was given to race-neutral alternatives to achieve diversity. Although the court ruled that achieving "student body diversity is a compelling state interest," its support is not indefinite.
"We expect that, 25 years from now," Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in the majority opinion in the law-school case, "the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today." That expectation led the majority to conclude, "We see no reason to exempt race-conscious admissions programs from the requirement that all governmental use of race must have a logical end point."
How likely is it that racial gaps will be substantially eroded in 25 years, so that the use of racial preferences is no longer desirable? Is the year 2028 a logical endpoint for special efforts to ensure that underrepresented minority groups are given a fair chance in admissions or employment, or will the vestiges of past discrimination and unequal treatment still largely be with us then?
These are not the legal grounds on which the court ruled, but the question is not without interest, and it is undoubtedly tied to society's demand for diversity in institutions of higher education.
Although a definitive answer is impossible, estimates of the extent of income mobility from fathers to sons provide a rough forecast. Studies find that 40 to 60 percent of the gap in earnings between a particular individual and the average worker is closed from one generation to the next. Results specifically for blacks tend toward the lower end of this range but are not significantly different, according to research by Bhashkar Mazumder of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
In 1969, the average 30- to 39-year-old black male worker -- who had attended separate and unequal schools and entered the labor force before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 barred discrimination -- earned 37 percent less than the average white worker. This gap was mainly because of the legacy of discrimination.
If -- and it is only a hypothetical if -- the depressed income of black workers is not prevented from regressing to the mean because of subsequent discrimination, then the gap would be expected to close to 15 to 22 percent for the next generation, and to 6 to 13 percent when members of the third generation reach their 30's, around a quarter century from now. The actual earnings gap for men in their 30's in 1999 -- roughly the second generation -- was 19 percent, so the forecast appears on track.
Continuing discrimination or backsliding on civil rights enforcement would slow this convergence, so Justice O'Connor's expectation is probably optimistic. Nevertheless, it is not unrealistic, at least when it comes to earnings, to think that the lingering effects of discrimination could be substantially reduced, though hardly eradicated, in the next quarter century or so.
For their part, many elite universities plan to continue using race-conscious admissions policies, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. 
In his bitter dissent in the law-school case, Justice Clarence Thomas made clear that he thought favorable treatment in admissions for minority students would prolong racial gaps in academic and economic achievement, not eradicate them: "These overmatched students take the bait, only to find that they cannot succeed in the cauldron of competition."
Beyond the alleged "harm" to students given favorable treatment in admissions, he went on to say that affirmative actions programs "stamp minorities with a badge of inferiority and may cause them to develop dependencies."
Instead of drawing on systematic evidence on the effect of affirmative action on students after they leave school, or on how the vast majority of minorities admitted to elite colleges actually viewed their college experience, Justice Thomas's opinion relied on introspection, selective anecdotes and the assertion that "no social science has disproved" his view that affirmative action is harmful.
"Somehow, someway, social scientists should say clearly to judges, even to Clarence Thomas, that evidence matters," said William G. Bowen, president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and co-author of "The Shape of the River" (Princeton University Press, 1998). In that book, Mr. Bowen and his co-author, Derek Curtis Bok, a former president of Harvard University, found that the more selective the college that black students attended, the more likely they were to graduate and earn an advanced degree, the more satisfied they were with their college experience, and the more successful they were later in life.
Moreover, these findings held for black students at the lower end of the College Boards distribution as well as those at the higher end, which is significant because those at the lower end were more likely to have been admitted to the elite schools because race was taken into account as a background characteristic along with other factors.
Some people -- including me -- have questioned whether all the salutary outcomes associated with attending an elite school are because of the school. (Stacy Berg Dale, a researcher at Mathematica Police Research, and I have published a study that found the selectivity of the undergraduate college one attends does not materially affects one's earning power later in life.) But the evidence certainly does not suggest that attending top colleges harms minority students.
No one raises concerns that preference in admissions given to athletes, cheerleaders and children of wealthy alumni causes self-doubt or stigma. The fact that this concern only rises to prominence when it comes to considering race as one of many factors in admissions illustrates how difficult it will be to overcome the lingering discrimination in American society.
A quarter century from now, the Supreme Court will have a tougher call as to whether diversity is still a compelling state interest, but chances are it will wind up back in the mushball middle when it revisits the issue then.

HEADLINE: Report Says Freddie Mac Misled Investors 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Freddie Mac, the big mortgage financier, has used a grab bag of accounting techniques to mislead investors about its results since 2000, according to a report released yesterday by the company. Gregory Parseghian, the new chief executive, knew of some of the tactics, which reduced reported profits, the report said.
 Freddie Mac, which for most of the last few years has faced the uncommon problem of having profits that substantially exceeded forecasts, did not want to deviate too much from those expectations, the report said. So it used techniques to make its main business of insuring and buying mortgages seem less profitable and to create a reserve of earnings for later years. 
 The 107-page report, prepared by outside investigators for Freddie Mac's board, underscores the complexity of the accounting used by Freddie Mac to present its results. It also underlines how easily financial companies like Freddie Mac can manipulate their reports to investors. 
Last month, Freddie Mac said it had understated its pretax profits by as much as $6.9 billion in 2002 and previous years as a result of serious accounting problems, and the company ousted its three top executives.
The report also offers more evidence of what regulators and many investors say is a culture of earnings management in corporate America. Like many other big publicly traded companies, Freddie Mac put a premium on meeting analysts' forecasts of its profits and providing consistent growth in reported earnings.
Paul Miller, senior analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, a regional brokerage firm in Virginia, said he and other analysts had too often taken on faith the earnings reports of Freddie Mac and other big financial companies.
"There's always been these companies, there's this black box in there, and you ask about their numbers, and they tell you what they want you to hear and you go back and write a report," Mr. Miller said. "When you get very, very straight earnings streams -- the economics of the business don't operate that smoothly."
Mr. Miller also said he did not know if Mr. Parseghian could survive as the company's chief executive. At one point, Mr. Parseghian told another senior official at Freddie Mac that he "needs help in earnings management," according to the report.
In a conference call yesterday, Mr. Miller said that Freddie Mac's chairman, Shaun F. O'Malley, appeared to be trying to blame the former management. "The company would like to think it's settled," he said. "Investors, they haven't quite bought into it yet."
Mr. O'Malley said yesterday that the board had confidence in Mr. Parseghian. "Greg is a person of considerable talent, deep expertise and unquestioned integrity," he said.
With more than $600 billion in assets, Freddie Mac is the fourth-largest financial institution in the United States. It is owned by investors but has a government charter to make housing more affordable by increasing the pool of capital available for mortgages. It owns or insures some 19 percent of all home mortgages.
For now, the problems at Freddie Mac have not had a broad impact on financial markets or the housing market, one of the few strong sectors in a struggling United States economy. Shares in Freddie Mac rose 60 cents yesterday, to $51.69, although they are down 13.7 percent since June 6, shortly before the company announced the firing of David W. Glenn, its president, and the resignations of Leland C. Brendsel, its chairman, and Vaughn Clarke, its chief financial officer. Freddie Mac's bonds have held their value since the announcement, dropping only slightly compared with Treasury bonds.
But the scope of the problems at Freddie Mac, and assertions by some institutional investors that its larger corporate cousin, Fannie Mae, has had multibillion-dollar losses that have been obscured by complex accounting, have caused critics of the companies to complain that they are taking on too much risk without enough government oversight.
The companies and the government both say that the debt is not guaranteed by taxpayers, but because of the two lenders' government sponsorship, many bond investors think that Washington would ultimately step in to repay them if the companies ran into financial trouble.
Such a guarantee could one day prove very costly to taxpayers, especially because both companies have about $50 in debt for every $1 in equity, giving them very little cushion against unexpected problems, the critics say.
James Bianco, president of Bianco Research, said: "At the end of the day, a lot of people think that this is all about nothing because if the company isn't able to pay me back, the government will anyway. We don't let Citigroup or J. P. Morgan Chase or Goldman, Sachs come to the bond markets and borrow to infinity without looking at the financial statements. But we certainly seem to with these guys."
The report released yesterday was prepared over the last seven months by the law firm Baker Botts for Freddie Mac's board. In December, the board's audit committee hired Baker Botts after the company received two anonymous letters saying it had misstated its 1999 results and committed other wrongdoing. Baker Botts determined that the accusations in the letters were largely wrong, the report said.
But in the course of its investigation of the letters, Baker Botts discovered other possible problems with the company's accounting policies. At the same time, PricewaterhouseCoopers, which Freddie Mac had hired in March 2002 to replace Arthur Andersen as its auditor, discovered problems in the company's books. As a result, Baker Botts broadened its investigation, according to the report.
James Doty, a lawyer in the firm's Washington office and the former general counsel of the Securities and Exchange Commission, led the inquiry. The board set no limits on the investigation's time or cost and directed all its employees to cooperate with the investigation, Mr. Doty said.
Besides using accounting techniques to create a reserve of earnings for future years, the report asserts, the company tried to conceal the impact of the techniques when it was forced to discuss them with the board and investors.
Further, the report says, Freddie Mac's accounting controls were weak for a company of its size, and the company discouraged employees from admitting or discussing accounting errors.
The techniques themselves fell into several categories, according to the report. Late in 2000, the company found itself with a large one-time gain because of an accounting change mandated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
Instead of reporting the gain to investors, the company sought ways to defer it over time. Senior managers, including Mr. Parseghian, approved a strategy that included selling and repurchasing some bonds in its portfolio, a transaction that had no economic effect but created a one-time loss to offset the gain. Over time, the loss would be reversed into the company's income, according to the report. The company intended the transaction to comply with standard accounting rules, but it did not, according to the report.
In another effort to hide its one-time gain in 2000, the company stopped using market prices for some of the derivatives in its portfolio, according to the report, which called the decision "results-oriented, reverse engineered, and opportunistic."

HEADLINE: Techies By Necessity, Not by Choice 

BYLINE:  By KATIE HAFNER 

 BODY:
JOSHUA MARCUSE didn't plan things this way. Mr. Marcuse, a 21-year-old who is about to start his senior year at Dartmouth College, had no desire to follow the example of his many peers who pursued technical fields. His academic studies are in international relations and moral philosophy. 
 "I would not describe myself as technically inclined," he said. "I almost have a neo-Luddite attitude to technology." 
 Yet Mr. Marcuse devotes several hours a week to the care and feeding of his computer, printers and other electronic devices. With no formal training, he has grown proficient at rummaging through his laptop's settings and changing them to suit any number of connection options. For several months he has been tinkering with the computer's balky DVD drive. He is so proficient that members of his family rely on him for all their technical needs. 
 As consumer electronics proliferate and consumers grow increasingly disenchanted with technical supportoperations (which routinely charge for calls), many people are discovering that whether they want to or not, they are developing more than a little technical proficiency. Some, like Mr. Marcuse, become virtual experts. But many of these accidental techies learn only as much as they absolutely must. 
 "People are getting more proficient because they have to, not because they want to," said Steve Cousins, manager of the Advanced Systems Development Laboratory at the Palo Alto Research Center, known as PARC, a subsidiary of Xerox. 
 PARC noted the trend toward self-sufficiency two years ago in a report on home computing. "As computers enter the home in greater numbers, individuals find themselves becoming systems administrators," it concluded. 
 Indeed, wrote the paper's authors, W. Keith Edwards and Rebecca E. Grinter, the average consumer performs chores that two decades ago would have been familiar only to a mainframe systems operator: installation and removal of hardware and software, and general troubleshooting and maintenance. 
 In the last two years, many devices have become more demanding. Home CD players are not simply turned on; they must be programmed before they can be used. Digital cameras seem relatively straightforward until the time comes to hook them up to the computer and download photos. Even cable TV boxes need to be rebooted from time to time. With the spread of constant broadband connections and in-house networks, people have had to become their own network administrators. 
 And if the future really does include Internet-ready coffee pots and refrigerators, the situation is only going to get worse.
 "I've definitely become more courageous over the years," said Ann Kilhoffer-Reichert, 41, a marketing consultant in San Diego who has never read a computer manual. Ms. Kilhoffer-Reichert said she used to take her computer in for repair whenever it malfunctioned. But now she tackles repairs herself, stopping just short of the operating system level. 
 Her first troubleshooting measure is usually to make sure everything is connected properly, with no loose wires. "I learned this lesson the day I unloaded and reloaded printer drivers and couldn't figure out why I still couldn't print," she said. "Then much to my embarrassment I found that the printer cable had come unplugged from the back of the computer."
 Ms. Kilhoffer-Reichert credited the Windows XP System Restore feature with much of her new-found "repair" ability. Recently, for example, the sound mysteriously disappeared from her computer. The speakers were working and all the wires were connected properly. So she went to the XP restore feature and selected the previous day. "Magically I had sound again," she said.
 Instead of calling tech-support lines, she also navigates her way through Web site lists of frequently asked questions, or FAQ's, which are growing more detailed and widespread to accommodate the technically proficient. 
 For Ms. Kilhoffer-Reichert and others, such expertise derives from economic necessity, as their livelihoods depend on the technical tools they use. "If my computer isn't working, I equate it directly to lost income," she said. 
 Yet Mr. Marcuse says he has learned just the amount he must, perhaps slightly less. "I can get my computer to operate most of the time, and frequently there are things wrong with it that I just tolerate," he said. "I don't want to deal with some company's tech support bureaucracy. I'd rather just suffer with the imperfection." 
 Often what results from learning only as much as you have to is a house of cards. If one thing goes wrong, it can bring everything else down with it. Many users know this but would rather risk the consequences than seek professional help. 
 "I call tech support only as a last resort," said Emile Barrios, 48, a self-employed marketing consultant in San Diego who fixes his own equipment. He said that most of his experiences with technical support lines have been disappointing. 
 "It seems they're less and less interested in finding a human being who can help you out with your problems," Mr. Barrios said. "You're on hold for 30 or 40 minutes before you get someone to help you." 
 Phyllis LaBaw, 45, associate athletic director at the University of South Florida in Tampa, is seldom away from her computer. As a result, she has grown self-reliant over the years without having attended a single computer-related class, she said. "You start spending time, and you're going to get to the point that eventually you're going to learn how to fix what you've botched up." 
 Still, for all the time they invest, most self-taught technicians would rather be doing something else. 
 Mr. Barrios would prefer a good game of golf to the many hours he spends tweaking and troubleshooting the computers and devices that populate his house. "And given the way I play golf, that's saying something," he said. "It's a testament to how little I want to do this." 
 Yet as the Southern California sun beckoned outside his window one day recently, Mr. Barrios remained inside, noodling with the Microsoft Word utility for printing addresses on envelopes. "It's like this unending thing, a part of my job now," he said. And they have no other option, thanks in part to interdependencies that have developed. Mr. Marcuse, for instance, said his parents planned their yearly schedule around his plans to be home. "They don't want to undertake a computer project when I'm not nearby," he said. 
 The technically proficient consumer is nothing new. "When electric wiring was first introduced in homes, people had to learn how to handle that and perhaps string wires themselves," said Donald Norman, a professor of computer science and psychology at Northwestern University. 
 Throughout much of the 19th century, the owner of a parlor clock had to install and regulate the pendulum, which required a certain amount of technical knowledge, said Joe Corn, a senior lecturer in history at Stanford University who is researching the history of consumers' encounters with technological complexity. Some 150 years ago, Dr. Corn said, sewing machines were sold with a wrench, a screwdriver and, often, an oiling can.
 The automobile is another example, Dr. Norman said. "Years ago, if you were rich enough, you had to take your mechanic with you on trips because cars broke down so frequently," he said. Thereafter, car owners learned to tinker under the hood themselves, making use of rather elaborate tool kits that were sold with the cars.
 Dr. Corn said that drivers of some early automobiles had to pump lubricating oil into the cylinders periodically, acting as a machine tender. By 1910, he said, virtually all automakers had automated that process. 
 Similarly, the rise of electronics has furthered automation. But, Dr. Corn noted, the constant addition of features introduces new sources of complexity. "The computer will never become simply an appliance as long as some users want software that does so many things," he said. 
 Electronic devices are growing more reliable, Dr. Norman said, but they still require maintenance. "The navigation system in my car works just fine,but every year they send me a new DVD and I lose all the addresses that I carefully typed in the previous year," he said. "Digital cameras, cellphones, P.D.A.'s, MP3 players all need maintenance." 
 What's more, the variety of devices that must be fixed and maintained is expanding. "You purchase and learn how to use one gadget and you want the next gizmo that comes out," Ms. LaBaw said. 
 That is borne out by the book "PCs for Dummies," which used to cover just PC technology -- the hard drive, the monitor and the disk drive. The ninth edition of the book, expected in October, will include a section covering peripherals like digital cameras, scanners and printers.
 "And that list continues to expand," said Andy Cummings, vice president and publisher of Wiley Technology Publishing in Indianapolis, which publishes the "For Dummies" series. 
 As a result, the sheer number of hours spent tinkering has grown. "There are times when I feel that I've worked the whole day and done no work," Dr. Norman said. "All I have done is maintained or fixed my computer equipment." 
 The shift toward self-sufficiency is being noticed by those who run technical support operations. "Five years ago, more calls than not were about problems, about things not working," said Matt Fingerhut, director of consumer technical support at Microsoft. "Today they are overwhelmingly from customers trying to take advantage of new features of software." 
 Joe L. Pastorelli, who is in charge of customer service and information technology at Linksys, which makes networking equipment for the home, agreed. "We used to see a lot of techno-geek people that would come in, and it's completely gone to the other side of the coin," Mr. Pastorelli said. "Now we've got the housewife who calls in and wants to hook up a wireless network in her home."

HEADLINE: In the Lecture Hall, A Geek Chorus 

BYLINE:  By LISA GUERNSEY 

 BODY:
AT the University of Maryland, it started as an innocent question posed in an e-mail message to those attending WebShop, a three-week lecture series about the Internet.
 "Does anyone else think it would be a good idea if we all had IM available to us during these lectures?" asked Sinan Aral, a doctoral student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, referring to instant messaging. "Several times after questions, I wanted to 'whisper' to someone across the room or send a relevant link." 
 Mr. Aral discovered that he was not alone. The next day in the auditorium, which was outfitted with a wireless link to the Internet, a group of people booted up their laptops, opened their IM programs and spent the next three hours happily exchanging notes during the presentations. 
 The "IM circle," as it became known at the June lecture series, soon attracted more than a dozen people at a time. As the speakers ran through their PowerPoint presentations, the room hummed with the tip-tap of IM chatter.
 "Is this really an economic issue?" wrote one audience member in response to a presenter's remark. "Experiments like this are too structured," wrote another. "Did he really just say that?" asked one. "Wow! He did," someone responded.
 Over the past year, as wireless networks have been introduced in hotels, university auditoriums and conference halls, people with laptops have realized that they do not have to sit idly during the presentations. Some people, of course, ignore speakers entirely by surfing the Web or checking their e-mail -- a practice that has led some lecturers to plead for connectionless auditoriums or bans on laptop use. 
 But others are genuinely interested in a lecturer's topic and want to talk concurrently about what is being said. They may also like to pass around links to Web sites that relate to, and may refute, a speaker's point. For them, wireless technology allows a back channel of communication, a second track that reveals their thoughts and feedback and records it all for future reference.
 Cory Doctorow, a science fiction writer and blogger who has experienced this back-channeling at several international technology meetings, likens the chatter to what happens in the corridor just after people leave a conference session. 
 "We're just moving the corridor into the room and time-shifting it by 30 minutes," said Mr. Doctorow, who takes notes and posts them to his Weblog, or blog, during conferences, enabling people to follow the speaker and Mr. Doctorow's take on the speaker at the same time.
 Clay Shirky, an adjunct professor in New York University's interactive telecommunications program, has run experiments using messaging software to supplement face-to-face meetings of 30 people. Many participants find the experience highly stimulating, he said, explaining, "The intellectual quality of a two-track meeting is extraordinarily high, if it is run right and you have smart people involved." 
 But many speakers at the front of room are less enamored of the practice.
 "To me, it's a little irritating, frankly," said Stewart Butterfield, chief executive of Ludicorp, a company that is developing Neverending, a multiplayer online game. In April, Mr. Butterfield addressed a conference on emerging technologies as listeners experimented with messaging software, including a program called Confab offered by his own company. The next week, when he spoke at a conference without any Internet access, "people were a lot more attentive," he said. (He added, however, that many of them kept opening their laptops during the speeches in the vain hope that somehow the Internet might have magically become available.)
 Indira Guzman, a doctoral student and adjunct professor at Syracuse University who was at the WebShop lecture series, said she had become aware of the back-channeling while teaching her classes. "You realize that something is going wrong," Ms. Guzman said. "You think, 'Uh-oh, maybe they are talking about me."'
 Some people who have experienced the phenomenon cite a speech given last year at a computer industry conference by Joe Nacchio, former chief executive of the telecommunications company Qwest. As he gave his presentation, two bloggers -- Dan Gillmor, a columnist for The San Jose Mercury News, and Doc Searls, senior editor for The Linux Journal -- were posting notes about him to their Weblogs, which were simultaneously being read by many people in the audience.
 Both included a link forwarded by a reader in Florida to a stock filing report indicating that Mr. Nacchio had recently made millions of dollars from selling his company's stock, although he complained in his speech about the tough economy. "No sympathy here," Mr. Gillmor wrote.
 "When Dan blogged that, the tenor of the room changed," Mr. Doctorow said. Mr. Nacchio, he said, "stopped getting softball questions and he started getting hardball questions."
 Some people are hoping that conferences will evolve to allow the undercurrent of conversation to be projected on a big screen in the front of the room. They say that such public disclosure will enable speakers and unconnected audience members to feel less isolated. 
 Mr. Shirky, the adjunct N.Y.U. professor, considers openness to be critical to productive discussions and conducts his messaging-software experiments so that all speakers can see what is being posted. At the University of Maryland, where the use of IM became a matter of a heated debate, several students said they were perturbed by the back channeling not because it seemed rude (although some argued that point, too), but because they felt left out. 
 The split focus of two-track meetings and back-channeled conversations have other drawbacks, not the least of which is that they can be utterly distracting. "There were times when I'd follow a thread and come back to the lecture and feel a little disoriented," Mr. Aral acknowledged. 
 Joichi Ito, a venture capitalist and former chief executive for the Japanese branch of the Internet service provider PSINet, opened a chat room for back-channeling during Supernova, a communications conference held this month in Crystal City, Va., just outside Washington. But Mr. Ito readily acknowledges the downside. "There is definitely a lot less focus in the room," he said, "but I think we were already starting to suffer from that."
 At high-tech conferences where everyone is already wired to the gills with BlackBerry pagers and cellphones and can cope easily with constant connectedness and streaming information, the concept of multitrack communication channels almost seems matter-of-course. "This is not something that is going to go away," Mr. Ito said. As many technology experts point out, if laptops were banned, people would use cellphones. If wireless Internet access were not officially available, networking gurus would find a way to create ad hoc connections.
 Some observers say that the multitrack channels will simply be considered a given by a young generation that has honed multitasking to a fine art and grew up on VH1's "pop-up" videos, in which commentary about the artists pops up on the screen during the song. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Ito is already creating a new riff on the concept. He said he was working with a group on designing a "hecklebot," a light-emitting diode screen that displays heckling messages that are typed during online chats at conferences. "I want to make something that I can put in a suitcase and take to conferences," he said. He describes it as a subversive device that will get people thinking about the significance of the back channel. From the chat room, he said, "you could send something like, 'Stop pontificating."'
 If the speakers were logged on, they could play the game, too. Maybe some would type, "Pay attention."

 CORRECTION:
An article in Circuits last Thursday about wireless online chat among audience members during conferences omitted part of the title of a computer game being developed by Ludicorp, a company whose chief executive was irritated by the practice at a recent conference. It is Game Neverending, not just Neverending.

House Passes Bill to Block New Media Rule by F.C.C.
The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed legislation to block a new rule supported by the Bush administration that would permit the nation's largest television networks to grow bigger by owning more stations.
 The vote, 400 to 21, sets the stage for a rare confrontation between the Republican-controlled Congress and the White House. There is strong support in the Senate for similar measures, which seek to roll back a decision by the Federal Communications Commission to raise the limit on the number of stations a network can own.

HEADLINE: SHOOTING AT CITY HALL: THE COUNCILMAN; 
Davis Recalled as Maverick Who Rallied Against Violence

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS with DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
To many in central Brooklyn, Councilman James E. Davis was the man whose face was the centerpiece of red-and-white campaign posters on scores of bus shelters and store windows in the area. 
 To others, he was the combative, upstart politician who took on anyone and everyone, from the City Council speaker to the Democratic Party organization in Brooklyn, with which he fought bitterly and publicly. 
 At the time of his death yesterday, Mr. Davis, a former police officer and part-time minister, had emerged from the pack of 51 largely unknown City Council members as a maverick quick with a dig and a quotation. He was antagonistic, deliberately so and did not hesitate to speak his mind, no matter whom he might offend. 
As the news of his death at the hand of a political rival spread yesterday, residents of Mr. Davis's district began to gather outside his Council office in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, to leave flowers, candles and mementos. Even bitter foes expressed outrage over the shooting of the 41-year-old councilman.
"This is such a tragic loss," said Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., the Brooklyn Democratic chairman, whom Mr. Davis had challenged at every turn. "James Davis was a very talented public servant who was just beginning to demonstrate his leadership skills. It is beyond ironic that he dedicated himself to nonviolence, both as a police officer and as founder of Stop the Violence marches in Crown Heights and Fort Greene."
Mr. Davis's election to the City Council two years ago came after a series of unsuccessful campaigns. The most notable was in 1998 against Mr. Norman, an incumbent who was defending his Assembly seat. Mr. Davis, then a police officer who ran an annual march against violence, came within 600 votes of defeating the Brooklyn Democratic leader.
From then on, Mr. Davis was seen as a political force to reckon with. Two years later, he lost again to Mr. Norman but had become a well-known political personality in Fort Greene, Clinton Hill and Crown Heights. By 2001, when Councilwoman Mary Pinkett was forced out because of term limits, Mr. Davis was quickly seen as the front-runner in a seven-candidate primary. 
Not long after joining the Council, Mr. Davis became even more of a fixture in his district, going sometimes to three or four church services on Sundays and spending nights at community meetings. 
Some politicians, usually those on opposite sides of issues, described him as being brash. He became known for taking stands in the Council that would place him squarely against the leadership. Earlier this year, Mr. Davis voted against an 18.5 percent increase in the property tax, prompting the Council speaker, Gifford Miller, to strip him of his seat on the Cultural Affairs Committee. Mr. Davis threatened to sue Mr. Miller to regain his seat, then used every opportunity to criticize the speaker.
More recently, Mr. Davis disagreed with Mr. Miller and other leaders on a move to amend the city's term-limit laws in a way that would extend the terms of office for several council members, including Mr. Miller. The issue had two rounds in court; during that time Mr. Davis indicated that he might want to succeed the speaker.
Mr. Davis's ambition was no secret. He talked from time to time of his interest in one day running for a host of positions, including United States Congress and even mayor. Just yesterday morning, he spoke with a reporter about his confidence in winning re-election this year. 
Mr. Davis was born on April 3, 1962, and graduated from Tilden High School in 1980 and from Pace University. In 1989, Mr. Davis joined the city's Correction Department. In 1991, he became a New York City Transit police officer. Two years later, he was transferred to the Police Department and eventually worked in the Police Academy, where he was an instructor until 1998. 
While he was a police officer, Mr. Davis organized the annual march in Crown Heights, emphasizing, as he put it "nonviolence and self-respect." The marches attracted the support of figures like Don King, the boxing promoter, but they also drew criticism from some of Mr. Davis's rivals, who said the events were to promote his political aspirations. 
Mr. Davis also had a highly publicized battle with his employer. After the 1998 primary against Mr. Norman, the Police Department fired Mr. Davis, contending he had been the Liberal Party's official candidate in the general election (police officers are required to resign once they become the official candidate of a political party). 
But Mr. Davis said that he had not been an official candidate and had never received notice that he was the party's designated candidate. The Liberal Party and the Board of Elections supported Mr. Davis's contention, and after 14 months of unemployment, the State Supreme Court ordered his reinstatement in 2000. 
It remains unclear what will happen to Mr. Davis's position on the ballot in the Democratic primary. Under the election laws, a committee on vacancies that had been selected by Mr. Davis as part of the petitioning process can select a candidate to replace him. Any substitution must be made by the first week of August. 
But yesterday, little to no attention was devoted to the political aftermath in the 35th Council District. 
Last night, about a dozen council members, including Mr. Miller, were at an emotional service at Brown Memorial Church attended by Mr. Davis's mother. The service drew hundreds of community residents, including several of Mr. Davis's opponents from the 2001 Council race.
And earlier, crowds gathered outside the home of the councilman's mother. Geoffrey Davis, his brother, emerged from the home and spoke to those outside. "I'm heartbroken and I'm weak," he said. "But we have to keep on going. We've got to love each other, and we've got to stop the violence."

HEADLINE: Powerless to Change Tax Credit, House Democrats Turn to Protest 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23 

 BODY:
Democratic lawmakers slowed business in the House to a crawl today, conducting an hour or two of obstruction to protest the refusal of House Republican leaders to expand the child tax credit for low-income families.
 Using one of the few tools available to members of the minority party, Democrats repeatedly forced the House to stop debate and vote on procedural motions they knew would not pass, like immediate adjournment. House Democrats said they also planned to force a vote every half hour on Thursday to make the same point. 
 "Democrats are in the heat of battle on the floor of the House using every weapon in our arsenal to disrupt the schedule and to force a vote on the child tax credit," the party's House leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said. 
Beginning Friday, the government will mail checks of $400 per child to 25 million middle-income families, as part of President Bush's new tax cut law. But 6.5 million minimum-wage families with children will not receive the checks, the result of a decision in May by the White House and Republican lawmakers not to include them in the tax cut because most do not pay federal income taxes.
House Republican leaders have said they will increase the tax credit for low-income families only as part of a much broader tax-cut package for wealthier families, a position that has led to a stalemate in talks with less conservative Senate Republicans. Today's slowdown was the latest effort in a seven-week barrage of news conferences and demonstrations by Democrats to make Republicans pay a political price for their position.
The effect of the slowdown, however, was mostly to annoy Republican appropriations leaders, who had to stay much later than planned to pass an unrelated foreign operations spending bill tonight.
"This really throws us behind," said Representative C. W. Bill Young, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee. "I would really like to get this bill done, but they're using one of the tools of the minority."
Neither Democrats nor Republicans said they expected the tactic to have much effect on the negotiations over the tax credit. But with President Bush scheduled to speak on Thursday at a Philadelphia office where the tax credit checks are being printed, extolling the economic benefits of the tax cut, Democrats said they would not let the House begin its August recess this week without at least putting up a fight on the matter.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Money Is Likely to Go Unspent 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday that it would not spend $103 million of its record $716 million budget this fiscal year because it could not hire accountants and investigators fast enough.
 Congress increased the budget 63 percent for the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30 to help the agency combat fraud and restore investor confidence. 
The unspent money is about a third of the increase. 
 "I am perplexed," said William A. Niskanen, chairman of the Cato Institute in Washington and a former member of President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. "At a time when the Congress and the president seem to be willing to give the S.E.C. a lot more money, they found they couldn't spend it."
The House Appropriations Committee has proposed using the $103 million in the S.E.C.'s budget for the 2004 fiscal year. The appropriation is being debated by the full House.
That bill provides $841.5 million for the S.E.C. for the 2004 fiscal year, the amount the agency was previously projected to get. That means in effect it is losing the $103 million it cannot spend before fiscal 2003 ends.
"A lot of the money was for additional staff," said Peter Derby, a managing executive at the agency. "We didn't pay those people because they didn't exist."

HEADLINE: Compassion and the Tax Cuts 

 BODY:
President Bush is planning a victory lap today for his latest round of tax cuts, visiting Philadelphia to signal the first mailings of $400 government checks to 25 million middle-class families entitled to expanded child credits. Missing from the photo opportunity, unless the president plans something truly dramatic, will be any children from poor families left out of the child-credit boon while the Republican-controlled Congress continues to wrangle over this shameful omission. 
 When the slight to the neediest first became clear six weeks ago, the White House claimed that the president wanted Congress to quickly repair the damage so 6.5 million poor families could share in the benefit. Since then Mr. Bush has made no obvious effort to broker a solution between House and Senate Republican leaders who seem intent on a stalemate more than a solution. Their "compromise" proposals would include outrageous extra helpings of child credits for Americans earning more than $150,000 a year. This would add tens of billions of dollars to the deficit. 
 Only the president has the clout to engineer a true, less costly solution in the days remaining before Congress's summer recess. There are 12 million deserving children in poor families that are far more likely than the affluent to immediately spend the money in the economic stimulus Mr. Bush has been promising. As the Republican government's priorities become ever clearer, the status of the nation's poorest children is a prime litmus test for the G.O.P. vows of compassion. 
In another crucial measure, Congress is proposing to tighten requirements for workers receiving temporary welfare aid -- mandating 40 hours of work from them rather the current 30. This means a parent will need more child-care aid in order to be free for the required low-wage job. Some 350,000 impoverished children will likely be denied care in the next five years. No help is in the offing as the Republicans shrink the federal revenue flow and channel tax cuts to the upper brackets.

HEADLINE: White House Memo; 
Deaths of Hussein's Sons Allow Change of Subject

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23 

 BODY:
With the deaths of Saddam Hussein's sons on Tuesday in Iraq, a bad political month for President Bush got palpably better.
 Suddenly the big summer story was no longer whether Mr. Bush had misled the nation in his State of the Union address. The prospect that American troops in Iraq might face prolonged guerrilla warfare seemed diminished. The Democratic presidential field had to temper and qualify its increasingly aggressive attacks on the White House's postwar foreign and military policies. 
 Speaking in the Rose Garden this morning, Mr. Bush devoted only a few sentences to the deaths of Uday and Qusay Hussein, saying that "more than ever, all Iraqis can know that the former regime is gone and will not be coming back."
But privately, advisers to the White House said the development marked an important turn of fortune that will help Mr. Bush frame the political debate for the rest of the summer and into the fall on terms more favorable to him.
"He's not going to do a victory death dance -- that's not appropriate for the president," said one Republican who works closely on strategy with the White House. 
"But the death of the Hussein brothers has a tactical political meaning because it changes the subject from the 16 words in the State of the Union," he said, referring to Mr. Bush's use of what the White House later acknowledged was unreliable evidence suggesting that Iraq had been trying to acquire uranium in Africa for nuclear weapons. 
Democrats said Mr. Bush would not easily wipe away the questions about his credibility or escape doubts among some voters about whether his economic and foreign policy is succeeding. And there is lingering concern within the president's party. Only a few days ago, Republican strategists, including some with close ties to the administration, were acknowledging that Mr. Bush was having his worst stretch in political terms since early in his presidency.
The rise in the unemployment rate and the surge in the federal budget deficit undermined his assurances that his tax cuts would nurse the economy back to robust health. 
The steady if relatively small loss of American life in Iraq and the acknowledgment by the American commander in the region that United States forces there faced a classic guerrilla campaign conjured up all kinds of unwelcome associations. And the White House's fumbling efforts to explain how possibly flawed intelligence about Iraq's nuclear program got into the State of the Union speech had shown Mr. Bush's top aides to be uncharacteristically willing to indulge in finger pointing.
"This is one of the worst weeks Bush has had because everyone is challenging, Republicans and Democrats, the credibility and integrity of the White House," a prominent Republican said late last week.
But the mood among Republicans changed once the military confirmed that they had found and killed the Hussein sons.
Republicans said they would be happy to debate Democrats on the handling of Iraq and the war on terrorism and readied a push to claim credit for what they expect to be a gradual economic improvement.
In a sign that the White House is still on the political offensive, Mr. Bush will travel on Thursday to Pennsylvania and Michigan, two states that he lost to Al Gore in 2000. In Pennsylvania, Mr. Bush will visit the government printing plant sending tax rebate checks of up to $400 per child to 25 million middle-income families.
The president faces plenty of political heat on the economy. Democrats are geared up to attack him on Thursday for not doing more to force his party to extend the $400 credit to 6.5 million low-income families left out of the original legislation.
Moreover, it is not clear whether the questions about Mr. Bush's credibility raised by the problems with the State of the Union address will continue to dog the White House. But Mr. Bush's case on that score got a boost on Tuesday night from former President Bill Clinton. Mr. Clinton told "Larry King Live" on CNN that "everybody makes mistakes when they are president" and that it was "incontestable that on the day I left office there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons" in Iraq.
Mr. Clinton may have been signaling to his party's presidential candidates that fighting Mr. Bush on his handling of the war is a losing proposition. 
But, sensing that Mr. Bush might be vulnerable on his handling of the postwar situation in Iraq and on related issues like his willingness to pay for beefed up security at home, Democratic strategists said the presidential candidates were likely to keep up their attacks on the president's foreign policy. The reasoning, they said, is that if they can diminish Mr. Bush's current advantage on national security issues, they can move the election to the economy and the White House's record of presiding over millions of job losses.
"The political threat to the White House has never been that Bush would be impeached or humiliated over 16 words about Iraq," said Bruce Reed, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group. "It's that if the president fumbles away his national security trump card, he has a very weak hand."
Republicans said their polling showed that Mr. Bush's approval ratings for his handling of the war remained extremely strong and that there had been little damage to his reputation as a straight shooter from the State of the Union address. 
"I want the Democrats to stay on the tack they're on, which is attacking Bush's honesty," a Republican adviser said. "It's like attacking Clinton's knowledge of policy. It plays right to our strengths. If they actually attacked us on policy, we might have a harder time."

HEADLINE: Better Alive Than Dead 

BYLINE:  By Sandra Mackey; Sandra Mackey is author, most recently, of "The Reckoning: Iraq and the Legacy of Saddam Hussein."

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
The killing of Saddam Hussein's sons, Uday and Qusay, is a tactical victory for the American occupation of Iraq. But it is not a strategic one. By not capturing these odious symbols of the old regime alive and putting them on display, the American occupation authority has denied itself the chance to give absolute proof of their demise to a society that rejects authority and thrives on conspiracy theory. It has also lost an opportunity to give Iraqis a chance to purge their bitterness, and satisfy a deep-seated need for revenge, by confronting their tormentors in court. 
 Yesterday the United States presented evidence -- dental records and identifications by officials of the Hussein regime -- to prove that the brothers were indeed killed in a firefight with American forces. But many Iraqis seemed unpersuaded. Even more telling, others voiced disappointment over the two not being captured and subjected to the sort of treatment they meted out to their victims. By denying Iraqis their revenge on the sons of Saddam Hussein, the American authorities have overlooked the needs of a society dominated by the rural values of the diverse tribes that make up much of the country's population. 
 This background of revenge may put the lie to the optimistic declarations by United States officials that the corner has been turned in the pacification of Iraq. With the deaths of the two brothers, they predict, Saddam Hussein's followers will lose their will to resist. And while the officials concede that in the short run the deaths may result in increased guerrilla attacks on American troops, they also argue that soon those passions will be spent.
But another possible series of reactions cannot be ignored, however. Strikes against the American military in Iraq may decline immediately only to re-ignite later. For the Iraqis have long memories. Supporters of Saddam Hussein may lie low before seeking revenge for what the American invasion of Iraq has done to their status in the power structure. More significantly, tribal elements who opposed the regime may hold the United States responsible for not giving them the opportunity to extract their own vengeance on Uday and Qusay Hussein. 
It is also uncertain whether the United States will be able to tell its story to the Iraqi people. The American military may control large parts of Iraq, but it does not control the flow of information. The Iraqi media is capable of devising its own narrative of the firefight, and there's a good chance that this narrative will not paint the United States in a favorable light. (Even the American release of photographs may not confirm that the brothers were killed.)
The United States continues to forget it is dealing with a culture that is far older and far different from its own. Suspicion and distrust of authority is deeply rooted in Iraq. Through Iraq's long history, conqueror followed conqueror. As a result, the diverse groups of people who lived in what came to be designated as Iraq in 1921 found their only real security in family and tribe. Even though the elite that ran Iraq after independence in 1932 had urban attitudes, the ties of family and group remained enormously important. 
In 1968, when the Baath Party came to power, the tribalism that had been a characteristic of Iraq since its inception intensified. The Baath Party itself was the purview of one tribe, the Bu Nasir, the tribe of Saddam Hussein. In 1991, in the service of survival after the gulf war, Saddam Hussein gave tribalism a prominence it had not been accorded since the formation of Iraq. At the same time, repressive politics and economic hardship continued to drive out the old urban elite and much of the urban middle class that had risen during the oil boom of the 1970's. In the last decade of his regime, Saddam Hussein remade Iraq into a country governed by the rural values of the tribes. Operating according to the values of the tribe, the system sanctioned the age-old principle of revenge.
Saddam Hussein meted out revenge on those who defied the system. They went into the regime's torture chambers and prisons. Tribes visited revenge on the regime for slights to their honor and for punishment of their members by Saddam Hussein's security system. The imperative of revenge was no different in late-20th-century Iraq than it had been for the tribes living for generations on the land of Iraq. This is a fact that the Bush administration needs to realize. 
In giving up on the attempted capture of the Hussein brothers as too risky, the American administration of Iraq has ignored the dictates of Iraqi culture. At the same time, it also runs counter to the kind of country we want Iraq to become -- one built around the rule of law. Under Mr. Hussein's reign, justice, to the extent it existed, was consistently perverted. It was erratic, violent and retributive, a tool of Mr. Hussein and his Baath Party. By not doing more to allow Uday and Qusay Hussein to surrender, the United States lost an opportunity to show Iraqis that those who have committed the most heinous of crimes can still be brought to justice. 
On trial in Baghdad, the Hussein brothers could have recounted the regime's crimes. Certainly, the effort would have been moredrawn-out than a firefight -- getting Balkan criminals to The Hague has not been easy -- but the results would have been more lasting. An appearance by the brothers would not only have pinned them to their gruesome past, it would have also demonstrated the effectiveness of a sound system of justice.
The deaths of Uday and Qusay Hussein are being proclaimed a victory, but it is a temporary victory. And the manner in which they died is yet another long-term complication for the American occupation of Iraq.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. MEDIA RULE BLOCKED IN HOUSE IN A400-TO-21 VOTE 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23 

 BODY:
The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed legislation today to block a new rule supported by the Bush administration that would permit the nation's largest television networks to grow bigger by owning more stations.
 The vote, which was 400 to 21, sets the stage for a rare confrontation between the Republican-controlled Congress and the White House, because there is strong support in the Senate for similar measures, which seek to roll back last month's decision by the Federal Communications Commission to raise the limit on the number of television stations a network can own. The F.C.C. has ruled that a single company can own television stations reaching 45 percent of the nation's households, but the House measure would return the ownership cap to 35 percent. 
 Only a few weeks ago, support for the F.C.C.'s move by House Republican leaders had been expected to counter the Senate uprising. But many House members from both parties have evidently taken note of the vocal resistance to the F.C.C. action by many members of the public and a broad spectrum of conservative and liberal lobbying groups -- from the National Rifle Association to the National Organization for Women. 
Today's House rebuke of the F.C.C. was embedded in a spending bill. The White House, which has threatened to veto the bill if the network provision remains in it, today sought to play down the lopsided size of the vote. Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, said that presidential advisers had recommended approval of the legislation so that it could proceed to a House-Senate conference committee where the network ownership provision might be stripped out. 
If, as is becoming more likely, the provision survives in final legislation, President Bush will face a difficult political predicament. He could carry out his veto threat and alienate some of his traditional constituents, which include several conservative organizations opposed to a number of new rules adopted by the F.C.C. Or, he could sign the legislation, abandon the networks and undercut his own advisers who have recommended that he reject the legislation.
A number of Republicans said privately today that they were surprised that the president would be willing to expend significant political capital over the issue; others said the White House felt compelled to defend the decisions of a regulatory agency whose leaders it had appointed. 
Judging political sentiment from today's vote, a veto could be easily overridden in the House, and perhaps in the Senate, where there is also broad support for repealing some of the F.C.C.'s new media rules. 
Five weeks ago, the Senate Commerce Committee adopted a provision similar to the one the House passed today. The Senate committee passed the provision by voice vote after a wide majority of Democrats and Republicans on the committee expressed support for it. 
At the time of that vote, network executives and top aides to Michael K. Powell, the F.C.C. chairman and architect of the new rules, predicted that the effort to overturn the rules would die in the House because its leadership had supported them. The vote, a clear repudiation of Mr. Powell, suggested that he miscalculated the widespread opposition to the new rules.
One of the main sponsors of the Senate provision, Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and other Senate supporters of reversing the rules include Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, and Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on both the Senate Commerce Committee and the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the F.C.C.'s budget. Senate officials said they expected that a measure to roll back the F.C.C.'s decision would reach the floor soon after the Senate returned from its summer recess in September.
Supporters of the effort to overrule the F.C.C. said that today's action demonstrated that the leadership in the House, as well as the White House, had lost control over the legislation.
"The House has now repudiated the F.C.C.'s attempted giveaway of the public airways to national media giants based in New York and L.A.," said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee and author of the network ownership provision in the bill. "I hope the administration is listening and will fix its flawed policy, so citizens can get accurate, free-flowing information -- the lifeblood of democracy."
Administration officials appeared committed to the new rules and to opposing Congressional attempts to repeal them. 
After the vote, Stephen Friedman, the president's top economic adviser, dismissed the assertion by the legislation's backers that further media consolidation would reduce the diversity of voices on the airwaves. He said that if all four networks reached 45 percent of the nation's homes, that would demonstrate that there is competition in the media market. 
Asked in a brief telephone interview how the administration might be able to turn the tide in Congress, he said, "I think we try to educate the members and make the case."
He also conceded that he was not a media specialist and that he was only beginning to understand the political forces at play. "The politics I'm still getting an education on," he said.
A number of Democratic presidential contenders, meanwhile, have criticized the rules and the consolidation in the media industry. They include Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor; Senator John Edwards; Senator John Kerry; and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich. 
But traditional allies of the administration, most notably a coalition of religious and conservative groups, have also joined liberal organizations in attacking the new rules. The religious and conservative organizations have said they fear the growth of the media may reduce their access to the airwaves. They also blame the networks for programming that they say is increasingly violent and indecent. The coalition includes the Parents Television Council, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Consumers Union, the Writers Guild of America and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
The concern over the growth of media conglomerates transcends traditional party lines in part because of the personal experiences of many politicians. Congressional aides say lawmakers fear that they could suffer political problems if there are too few media outlets in their home districts, making it more difficult for them to convey their messages to their constituents and increasing the influence of the remaining newspapers and stations.
Mr. Powell and the networks have responded with the assertion that without some regulatory relief for the networks, free over-the-air television could be eliminated. The networks say that they need to find new ways to raise revenues to support expensive programming like the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl, and that owning more stations will give them the money to do so. 
Mr. Powell, who had been largely silent during the Congressional debate, today issued a statement defending the F.C.C.'s rules.
"Our democracy is strong," he said, saying that critics have overlooked the various ways the public receives information besides broadcast television. "It would be irresponsible to ignore the diversity of viewpoints provided by cable, satellite and the Internet."
Network executives agreed. They have been unhappy that the commission under Mr. Powell did not relax the rules even further and have suggested that they may bring a lawsuit to challenge even the new rules.
"NBC was disappointed, and today's action by the House was a huge step backwards in giving broadcasters the regulatory relief needed to compete with cable," Shannon Jacobs, an NBC spokeswoman, said. 
There are also signs that investors are nervous about the possible reimposition of the old rules. Stock prices of several of the parent companies of the networks -- General Electric, Owner of NBC; Viacom, owner of CBS; and the News Corporation, which owns Fox -- have declined slightly from their highs in early-to-mid June, around time of the approval of the new regulations. The broader market indexes, including media stocks more generally, continued to rise through mid-July. The shares of the companies were little changed today.
The networks had sought the elimination of the cap entirely, or at least raising it well above 45 percent. Two of the networks, CBS and Fox, are already slightly over the 35 percent limit and had been allowed to do on a temporary basis, pending the rule change.
The F.C.C.'s rule change had touched off deep divisions within the broadcasting industry.
The networks' local affiliate stations and smaller owners of broadcast stations had sought to keep the cap at 35 percent, saying they feared that any further growth in the networks' power would be detrimental to viewers in a variety of ways: homogenizing entertainment, discouraging local news coverage in favor of national broadcasts, and reducing the commercial leverage of the local stations to offer independent programming.
The networks' stakes in the fight was evident this week as their lobbyists desperately attempted to defeat the House measure. Congressional aides said that lobbyists for the News Corporation helped to circulate a one-sentence petition, endorsed by House leaders, saying that the undersigned members would vote to sustain a presidential veto. 
Attached to the memo, the aides said, was a set of policy "talking points" on the merits of the new rule that had been prepared by lobbyists from CBS's owner, Viacom, and the Walt Disney Company, parent of ABC.

HEADLINE: HOME VIDEO; 
Video Revenue Is Still Rising

BYLINE:  By Peter M. Nichols 

 BODY:
The factors that restrict the economy don't have too tight a grip on home video. While 2003 movie box-office receipts are down by more than 4 percent from last year, video revenue is up by 16 percent, according to a report by Video Business magazine. In the first half of the year consumers spent $10.2 billion buying and renting DVD's and videocassettes, a healthy performance for an industry that some analysts once wrote off as road kill on the supposed fast lane to the information superhighway. 
 Movies routinely make more money (sometimes twice as much) on video than in theaters: "8 Mile," starring the rapper Eminem, earned $117 million at the box office and $130 million on DVD and cassette; "Drumline" $56.4 million and $84.7 million, respectively; "Barbershop" $76 million and $102 million; "One Hour Photo" $31.6 million and $72.6 million. 
 A major reason of course is DVD. Close to half the households in the United States have DVD players. Many more have VCR's, but the smaller DVD universe has an impact beyond its numbers. 
"The first people in on a new technology are always the most active participants," said Scott Hettrick, editor of Video Business. "The first 50 percent disproportionately represent the lion's share of all buying and renting on home video."
Video Business reported that $4.8 billion has been spent buying DVD's so far in 2003, as opposed to $1.05 billion purchasing videocassettes. On the rental side DVD also has taken the lead over the cassette. The studios have priced discs low for sales, but not everyone wants to buy most movies. "The single biggest change this year is the surge in DVD rentals," Mr. Hettrick said. "At first with the prices so much less on DVD everybody dove in and bought everything, but now people are turning back to more typical habits and renting titles they don't want to watch many times."
Mr. Hettrick doesn't expect as much sales activity from the next 50 million DVD households. "DVD sales for the next several years will continue to outpace rentals, but it will be more of a balance," he said.
As DVD proceeds into the mainstream, movie selections broaden, with romantic comedies, family films and serious drama sliding in with the action fare that has dominated DVD since the early days.
Many of these films rent as well as they sell on DVD. Take "One Hour Photo," with Robin Williams as a clerk in a photo shop who develops an obsession with a customer and her family.
Of the $72.6 million that the film has made on DVD and cassette since its release in February, about $51 million has been from rental. Of that, $28 million has been for DVD rental and $23 million for cassette.
Mr. Hettrick said that it would take a couple of years, but that the era of the cassette was ending. Studios are eliminating stocks of older films on VHS, and they are beginning to squeeze out new films as well.
"We're already seeing some titles coming out only on DVD," he said.

HEADLINE: HAVENS; 
Weekender Shelter Island, N.Y.

BYLINE:  By ELLEN MAGUIRE 

 BODY:
OSPREYS, and people who admire them, love the bluffs, salt marshes and pebbled bay beaches of Shelter Island. Ospreys, hawklike birds with five-foot wingspans, were once ndangered in New York State. Now, about 30 pairs are scattered around Shelter Island, an 8,000-acre windswept island town tucked between the twin forks of eastern Long Island. Their nests, which can weigh 100 pounds and have been known to include pilfered beach toys and Hula Hoops, can be spotted on tall platforms erected for them by local conservationists.
 The ospreys have come to symbolize the island. Residents, full time and part time, are quick to point them out, and both the birds and the people like the Mashomack Preserve, which occupies nearly a third of the island. It was created in 1980 by the Nature Conservancy to limit local development and protect wildlife. 
 "It's just glorious to walk there," said Barbara Horgan, 70, a lifelong New York City resident and the director of the George Balanchine Trust. She attended camp on Shelter Island as a child and returned to buy a weekend home in 1989. In summer the paths through the rolling forests and meadows of the preserve are also good vantage points for glimpsing songbirds. 
With more than 25 miles of coastline, half a dozen beaches, three deep-water harbors, three marinas and a yacht club to lure them, weekenders spend a lot of time in and around the water. Janet Roach, a screenwriter who has lived part time on Shelter Island since 1979, and her husband, Dr. Gordon Potts, a retired neuroradiologist, dock a well-worn sloop near their renovated farmhouse on Coecles Harbor. On summer evenings when it is very hot, they sail to the farthest point of the harbor and drift while eating dinner.
Shelter Island is accessible only by ferry, from either North Haven or Greenport. The frequent morning mists, the rambling gardens, hidden inlets, and restored Victorian homes on steep, winding roads, along with unreliable cellphone reception, create a sense of otherworldliness. "We have Brigadoon here," Ms. Roach said. "Only with ticks."

The Scene
Julie Kavner (the voice of Marge Simpson), the art critic Robert Hughes and Hugh L. Carey, the former governor of New York, are among the part-time residents. The pace of life is slow and most residents socialize at home.
Keith Recker, a home furnishings designer from TriBeCa, and his partner, James Mohn, an architect, spent the last year renovating a 2,800-square-foot 1850's Greek Revival home, inspired in part by a group of their city friends who had bought houses nearby. "Most Saturday nights, there's some collection of us on someone's porch eating some kind of delicious food," Mr. Recker said. 
Other residents find reasons to venture out. Zeva and Don Shapiro attend free summer concerts at the Perlman Music Program, a residential program for student musicians led by Itzhak Perlman. "I love to hear those young kids playing their hearts out," said Ms. Shapiro, a Manhattan resident who built a 1,200-square-foot summer house in 1961 with her husband, a psychoanalyst and a former pianist.
Dr. Potts is a member of the Romeos (for Retired Old Men Eating Out), an unofficial group that gets together for lunch and takes trips to nearby Southold, on the North Fork, for lectures and the occasional video on the sex lives of oysters, clams and scallops. The Romeos have taken up shellfish farming off their own docks to help clean the island's waters. They also acknowledge gastronomic benefits, which they share with friends. "A dozen people came by the other night," Ms. Roach said. "The oysters came out of the bay by our dock at 5 and we were serving at 6."
Each August, the local volunteer fire department holds a chicken cookout to raise money. "It's the best party of the year," said Donna Winston, a human resources manager from Manhattan who shares a family compound on five waterfront acres with her parents, two sisters, two brothers-in-law and five young nieces and nephews. "The air around the island smells of barbecue sauce for two days," she said.
Last year Shelter Island began celebrating the 350th anniversary of the first English settlement there. Sheep lawn ornaments, sold to raise money for anniversary events, are still seen in yards. The festivities continue this year until September. "Two years of parties are better than one," said Art Williams, the town supervisor.

Pros
Harried city dwellers appreciate Shelter Island's friendliness. The post office employees greet customers by name, and residents catch up on local news at George's, the town's only large grocery store. "You're forever meeting people," Ms. Horgan said. "If you're going for three items, it takes you an hour to get in and out."
Mr. Recker, who bought his yellow Labrador, Betsy, through an ad posted at George's, said he liked the islandwide tag sales on Saturday mornings. "Everyone starts caravaning around, like pigeons on popcorn," he said.
There is no end to charming island quirks. The term "hareleggers" refers to residents born on the island; it derives from the need to run as quickly as hares for the last ferry home after dawdling on the mainland. People call each other nicknames like Zippy, Scratchy, Nanny, Tink and Toots, and when asked for directions, residents often tell visitors to turn left where the pink house used to be. 
Rushing traffic is not a problem. The islandwide speed limit is 35 m.p.h.; there is no stoplight.
Planet Bliss, which serves weekend brunches, is one of several good restaurants. Two fish markets, Bob's and Commander Cody's, serve casual dinners. Day-trippers flock to the Chequit Inn and to the open-air bistro at Sunset Beach, Andre Balazs's hotel on Crescent Beach.
Old houses and buildings reflect Shelter Island's simpler past. Benjamin Dyett, a lawyer, and his wife, Rosemarie Ryan, an advertising executive, who live in SoHo with their daughter, Ella, 5, found a 1790's farmhouse with hand-hewn beams and spent two years renovating it as their weekend home. They built walls along the driveway and next to their guesthouse with "the stones we found in the root cellar," Mr. Dyett said.

Cons
Gardeners beware. The deer are tick-laden and they are voracious eaters. Many residents hate them with a passion bordering on obsession. Mr. Recker forbids houseguests to mention the word deer unless it is accompanied by an unprintable expletive.
"I consider every bite of venison an act of retributive justice," said Ms. Roach, who has lost many a crop to her four-legged foes, often while she has stood in plain view.
Residents use elaborate protective measures, particularly in winter. "By the time we're finished," Ms. Roach said, "it looks like Christo came and wrapped the place."
Shelter Island is in Suffolk County, which has one of the highest rates of Lyme disease in the nation. Some Shelter Islanders have adopted a fatalistic attitude toward the recommended precautions. "If you can't go out barefoot on the grass, you might as well as go back to the city," Ms. Shapiro said.
Both the north and south ferries take less than 10 minutes, but long waiting lines at the north ferry can prolong the trip to an hour. In summer, the population can swell to 10,000. The nearest hospital is off-island, in Greenport.

The Real Estate Market
Earlier this week there were 64 properties on the market, and despite the weakened economy, sales are brisk. "There are no bargains out here, but sellers of houses listed at over $2.5 million are often open to negotiation," said Penelope Moore of Allan M. Schneider Associates (631-749-4000; www.allanschneider.com).
This week Schneider Associates was offering an 875-square-foot, two-bedroom cottage with a dock and a screened porch for $695,000, and a 3,512-square-foot, five-bedroom waterfront traditional, with sunset views, a boathouse, a guesthouse and a beach cabana, for $7.9 million.
"Two years ago, the attitude was 'We have to have the house,' " said Melina Wein of M. Wein Realty (631-749-0999; www.mweinrealty.com). "Now buyers are smarter about it."
Listings this week at Wein Realty included a 2,754-square-foot renovated 1890's house with four bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, a terrace and water views for $795,000, and a 1,392-square-foot restored farmhouse with four bedrooms, four bathrooms, a pool and a separate artist's studio for $980,000.

HEADLINE: France Makes Major Changes in Pension Law 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 24 

 BODY:
In a victory for France's center-right government, the Senate and the National Assembly today approved a groundbreaking law that would force the French to work longer before becoming eligible to retire on a full pension.
 The vote came after six weeks of debate but was not unexpected because the center-right French government has a comfortable majority in both chambers. The National Assembly voted 393 to 152 in favor of the bill; later in the day, the Senate approved it on a vote of 205 to 113. 
In a news conference before the votes, Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the architect of the reform of France's expensive and generous pension plan, praised the expected outcome and expressed hope that it would not cause permanent damage to relations between unions and employers. 
The reform "is not the victory of some over others," he said, "it is the victory of a shared effort of our country." 
He added, "I hope that in the country, there remains no scar from our debates." 
A major change in the law forces public sector workers -- more than one-fourth of the French work force -- to follow the same general formula as the private sector by 2008. More significant, public sector workers will have to contribute to the state pension system for 40 years instead of 37 and a half. 
Among other changes, tax incentives will be introduced to attract workers to company-based savings programs like those in the United States, and workers will be allowed to get a pension bonus if they work more than 40 years. 
Pension reform is by far the most explosive domestic issue in the country. France has a pay-as-you-go system in which current workers pay for the retirement of the previous generation. Mr. Raffarin has said that in 1960, four workers financed each pensioner, compared with two in 2000; by 2020, the ratio is expected to be one worker per pensioner. Without radical changes, he argued, the state pension fund would fall into deficit as early as 2005 and pensions would shrink by 50 percent in 20 years. 
The government's campaign to push through pension reform infuriated workers and union leaders, and set off broad recurrent strikes in recent months, disrupting classes at schools and universities and services at hospitals, halting newspaper and mail deliveries, and crippling transit. The strikes further hurt an already damaged economy. 
The vote and the traditional recess at the end of June were delayed by the introduction of 11,000 amendments, primarily by opposition Socialist and Communist deputies. 
Mr. Raffarin said he hoped to restore a "social dialogue" between unions and employers and to create a more constructive climate on future reforms. 
The government will next tackle its generous but underfinanced social security system, but it is likely to wait until next year before beginning any sort of ambitious campaign.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Plans for 2 Towers Near TriBeCa Raise Concern

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
A 35-story residential building is planned for a long-vacant lot two blocks north of the World Trade Center site, and an even taller apartment tower is being considered for the adjacent parcel, leaving residents of the low-lying 19th-century buildings in nearby TriBeCa concerned about crowding.
 The 35-story building is being designed by Norman Foster, the British architect who, among other projects, remodeled the Reichstag in Berlin and designed London City Hall. 
 Bernard D'Orazio, president of Save Our Space, a neighborhood nonprofit group, said he was "gravely concerned about enormous residential towers beside what is predominantly a low-rise historic district."
"The community's position is that both of these sites should be planned and developed together in order to preserve our community," he said. 
The two parcels -- officially referred to as Sites 5B and 5C -- are remnants of what for more than 100 years was the Washington Street Market, the city's primary fruit and vegetable district until the 1960's, when the market was moved to Hunts Point in the Bronx. Soon after, an 11-block-long, 3-block-wide swath of mostly cast-iron mercantile buildings stretching from Barclay Street on the south to Hubert Street on the north and from Greenwich Street on the east to the Hudson River was leveled.
And over the years, on what was designated as the Washington Street Urban Renewal Area, large buildings and complexes were built, including the towers of Independence Plaza North, a 1,500-apartment Mitchell-Lama development; Manhattan Community College; the St. John's University Manhattan campus; and the Citigroup Building. Also built on the site were Public School 234 and a one-acre oval of green space called Washington Market Park, with a wrought-iron gazebo, a wading pool and a community garden.
Across Greenwich Street from the park is TriBeCa, where late-19th-century corniced loft buildings with arched windows are now interspersed with new 10- and 12-story apartment buildings with terraces and bay windows that evoke the style of the older buildings.
What remains on the urban renewal property is Site 5B, a 90,560-square-foot lot, and Site 5C, at 34,257 square feet, where the Norman Foster building is planned. In 2001, the New York City Economic Development Corporation chose Minskoff Equities to develop 5B as a commercial building. But development did not proceed, because no major tenant was found. 
Now, said Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the Economic Development Corporation, "on 5B, we are examining our options to develop it as residential, with some retail." Mr. D'Orazio contended that zoning for the lot would allow construction of a building as high as 60 floors.
The designated developer for the smaller site, 5C, is Jack Resnick & Sons. Under the provisions of the 40-year urban renewal plan, a 135-foot-high residential building was allowed for the site. However, on Jan. 1, 2002, the plan expired. And at a public meeting held by the Economic Development Corporation on June 26, the plan offered by the Resnick company called for a 360-foot-high, 35-story market-rate rental building with about 480 apartments, 12,000 square feet of retail space, a 90-car parking garage and a community facility.
Madelyn Wils, chairwoman of Community Board 1, is worried about overpopulation. In 1980, according to census figures, there were 15,918 people living inthe community board district; by 2000, that had more than doubled to 32,116. "We're all for housing," Ms. Wils said. "But Lower Manhattan has been burgeoning. We have 12,000 units coming on line since the 2000 census, which would increase our population by 75 percent by 2005."
Scott Resnick, president of the Resnick company, declined to comment on his company's proposal for Site 5C. Pointing out that the plan for Site 5C must still go through a public review process, Ms. Patterson of the Economic Development Corporation said, "In our negotiations, we are responding to community desires."

HEADLINE: Japan's Neglected Resource: Female Workers 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 24 

 BODY:
When Yuko Suzuki went into business for herself after the advertising company she worked for went bankrupt, no amount of talk she had heard about the hardships facing professional women here prepared her for the humiliations ahead.
 As an independent saleswoman, she found that customers merely pretended to listen to her. Time and again when she finished a presentation, men would ask who her boss was. Eventually she hired a man to go along with her, because merely having a man by her side -- even a virtual dummy -- increased her sales significantly, if not her morale. 
 "If I brought a man along, the customers would only establish eye contact with him, even though I was the representative of the company, and doing the talking," she said. "It was very uncomfortable." 
Japan has tried all sorts of remedies to pull itself out of a 13-year economic slump, from huge public works projects to bailouts of failing companies. Many experts have concluded that the expanding the role of women in professional life could provide a far bigger stimulus than any scheme tried so far.
But it often seems that the Japanese would rather let their economy stagnate than send their women up the corporate ladder. Resistance to expanding women's professional roles remains high in a country where the economic status of women trails far behind that of women in other advanced economies.
"Japan is still a developing country in terms of gender equality," Mariko Bando, an aide to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, recently told reporters. This year the World Economic Forum ranked Japan 69th of 75 member nations in empowering its women.
While 40 percent of Japanese women work, a figure that reflects their rapid, recent entry into the job market, they hold only about 9 percent of managerial positions, compared with about 45 percent in the United States, according to the government and the International Labor Organization. Women's wages, meanwhile, are about 65 percent of those of their male counterparts, one of the largest gaps in the industrial world.
Japanese labor economists and others say it is no wonder, then, that Japan, which looked like a world beater 20 years ago, is struggling to compete economically today. With women sidelined from the career track, Japan is effectively fighting with one hand tied behind its back.
"Japan has gone as far as it can go with a social model that consists of men filling all of the economic, management and political roles," said Eiko Shinotsuka, assistant dean of Ochanomizu University and the first woman to serve on the board of the Bank of Japan.
"People have spoken of the dawn of a women's age here before," she said, "but that was always in relatively good times economically, and the country was able to avoid social change. We've never had such a long economic crisis as this one, though, and people are beginning to recognize that the place of women in our society is an important factor."
By tradition Japanese companies hire men almost exclusively to fill career positions, reserving shorter-term work, mostly clerical tasks and tea serving, for women, who are widely known in such jobs here as office ladies, or simply O.L.'s.
Ms. Suzuki, who went into business for herself, is the exception. These days Ms. Suzuki, an impeccably groomed 32-year-old who dresses in crisp suits and speaks at a rapid, confident clip, is the proud owner of her owncompany, a short-term office suite rental business in one of Tokyo's smartest quarters. "I am the only professional out of all of my girlhood friends," she said. "The rest are housewives or regular office ladies, and they all say that what has happened to me is unbelievable."
Whatever a woman's qualifications, breaking into the career track requires overcoming entrenched biases, not least the feeling among managers that childbearing is an insupportable disruption.
That is so even though the country faces a steep population decline and keeping women sidelined has had economic costs. Women's relative lack of economic participation may be shaving 0.6 percent off annual growth, a study presented to the Labor Ministry estimated last year.
Meanwhile, at companies where women make up 40 to 50 percent of the staff, average profits are double those where women account for 10 percent or less, the Economy Ministry reported last month.
A recent issue of Weekly Women magazine nonetheless recounted the stories of women who said they had been illegally dismissed because of pregnancy or had sought abortions for fear of being dismissed.
"I reported to my boss that I was pregnant and would like to take off for a medical check," Masumi Honda, a 33-year-old mother was quoted as saying. "When I came home from the hospital, I was shocked that he had just left a message saying that I needn't bother coming to work any more."
Other women say the intense competitive pressure in the workplace can lead to resentment, even in progressive companies, against mothers who avail themselves of child care leave or flexible work hours.
One woman, who abandoned a career in marketing after similar experiences in two companies, recounted taking leave for three days to look after a sick child. 
"After that I was not included in new projects," said the woman, who spoke on condition that she not be identified, "and after that I felt they saw me as an unreliable person. I finally decided that if I work in a company, I must understand the company's spirit, which means I couldn't feel comfortable taking maternal benefits."
The growing sense of urgency in official circles about these issues is driven largely by the projections of a population decline that could cause huge labor shortages over the next half-century and possibly even economic collapse. So far, though, government efforts to expand women's place in the economy have been modest and halting.
An advisory panel appointed by Prime Minister Koizumi recommended recently that the public and private sectors aim to have at least 30 percent of managerial positions filled by women by 2020. These days there is growing talk of affirmative action in Japan.
But changing mind-sets will be difficult. Earlier this year, former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, a member of a government commission charged with finding solutions to the population crisis, was widely quoted as saying the main reason for Japan's falling birthrate was the overeducation of its women.
Mr. Koizumi's top aide, Yasuo Fukuda, was recently quoted as saying that often women who are raped deserve it, while a legislator from the governing party said, approvingly, that the men who carried out such acts were virile and "good specimens." The latter comment came last month at a seminar about the falling birthrate.
While senior politicians bemoan overeducation as the cause of Japan's population problems, women unsurprisingly cite other reasons that make it difficult for them to have children and also play a bigger role in the country's economic life.
Foremost is the lack of day care, which for many forces stark choices between motherhood and career. There are also the working hours of many offices, which extend deep into the evening and sometimes all but require social drinking afterward.
Haruko Takachi, 37, a postal manager, is luckier than most. Her child was accepted into a 20-student nursery school opened last year by the Ministry of Education. 
It is the only public nursery school available for the 38,000 government employees who work in Kasumigaseki, central Tokyo's administrative district. Unlike most private nurseries, which close earlier, the school remains open until 10 p.m.
"I work until 8 in the evening, but there are plenty of times when I work much later," she said. "That's just the social reality in Japan. There are some other women in my milieu, but most of them have just one child and don't plan for more."
Ms. Suzuki, who founded her own business, has been married for several years and has no children. She regards day care as just a small piece of what is needed in Japan. Men and women, she says, must rethink gender roles -- an idea that she hesitantly concludes makes her a feminist.
"Men are really intimidated by professional women in Japan," she said. "But this is still a society where even when it looks like a woman has some authority, the men usually manage to stay on top."

HEADLINE: In Europe, Profits Are Painfully Low For Auto Industry 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 24 

 BODY:
A wintry chill has settled over Europe's automobile industry this summer, as DaimlerChrysler of Germany and Peugeot of France reported sharply lower profits today, while investors prepared for a bleak earnings report expected from Volkswagen on Friday.
 Renault managed to post an increase in profits, thanks to buoyant results at Nissan Motor, in which it has a 44 percent stake. But the fact that France's second-largest carmaker depended on its Japanese partner to salvage its numbers underscores the ills afflicting Europe's industry. 
 DaimlerChrysler, hobbled by a $1.1 billion operating loss at its Chrysler division, said its profits fell 90 percent in the second quarter from the year-earlier period. 
PSA Peugeot Citroen, dented by weakness in the French car market and the rising value of the euro, reported a 12 percent decline in its net income in the first half. Peugeot, one of Europe's top performers in recent years, also cut its earnings outlook for the rest of 2003.
The strong euro is likely to figure prominently in Volkswagen's earnings for the second quarter, which may have fallen 55 percent, the average forecast from 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.
While the causes of pain vary from company to company, the prevailing mood was summed up succinctly by Jurgen E. Schrempp, the chairman of DaimlerChrysler, in a conference call with analysts.
"We have a revenue problem," he said. "We have to deal with that."
DaimlerChrysler is battling lackluster sales in Europe, but its biggest difficulties stem from its 1998 merger with the Chrysler Corporation. Chrysler's sales continue to decline, while its profits have been hurt by the industry's reliance on rebates, low-interest loans and other costly incentives to sell cars in the United States.
Doubts about Chrysler have intensified since the disappointing debut of the Pacifica, an oversized station wagon that the company said would be the first of a diverting array of new models. Chrysler plans to offer a lower-priced version of the car -- around $30,000 instead of $38,000 -- to stimulate sales.
"Obviously, the start was not living up to our expectations," said Dieter Zetsche, the Mercedes executive sent by Mr. Schrempp to turn Chrysler's problems around. Still, he added, "we're seeing constant increases of Pacifica sales."
Mr. Schrempp asserted that Chrysler's current woes did not call into question the five-year-old merger. He said that deal had yielded other financial dividends through the sharing of parts and automobile platforms.
"We have had a setback, admittedly," he said. "But if you look at the trend, we are moving in the right direction."
In fact, DaimlerChrysler's results, though poor, were marginally better than analysts had forecast. The company had net income of 109 million euros ($124 million) in the second quarter, compared with 1.1 billion euros ($1.25 billion) in the comparable quarter last year. Its revenue of 34.3 billion euros ($39.2 billion) was 13 percent lower than a year earlier.
Mr. Shrempp said he saw some signs of economic recovery in DaimlerChrysler's main markets, and predicted that 2004 would be a better year than 2003. He appeared to endorse Mr. Zetsche, saying that the parent company, which is based in Stuttgart, would support the "great management" at Chrysler.
Daimler's Mercedes-Benz unit eked out a 2 percent increase in operating profit in the second quarter, based largely on robust sales of its E-class sedan. But even its flagship line faces questions about wavering quality in the wake of a report on vehicle dependability.
The report, by J. D. Power & Associates, ranked Mercedes behind Chrysler in the number of problems car owners encountered through three years of ownership. Jurgen Hubbert, the Daimler board member responsible for Mercedes, said he took the complaints very seriously.
"In many ways, we have already changed things to make it better," he said in the conference call.
Analysts, however, said that DaimlerChrysler's future depended mostly on whether it could turn Chrysler around. The company has not retreated from its promise that Chrysler would show a slight operating profit in 2003, a forecast that many analysts view with skepticism.
"Chrysler is in a crisis that's going to get worse," said Graeme Maxton, an analyst at Autopolis, a consulting firm in London. "It is a dead weight that could drag down the whole company."
Peugeot's problems are also linked in part to a single market, Britain, which has become far less profitable for foreign carmakers because of the euro's rapid appreciation against the British pound.
Net income at Peugeot fell to 869 million euros ($995 million) in the first half of 2003 from 985 million euros ($1.12 billion) in the first half of 2002. The company said most of the decline was caused by the shift in the exchange rate.
"This is the first time in six years we haven't met our first-half targets," said the chief executive, Jean-Martin Folz, at a news conference in Paris. The second half of the year, he said, scarcely looked better.
For Peugeot and other European carmakers, the erosion of profitability in Britain is a painful blow. Retail prices for cars are somewhat higher there than on the Continent, and until recently there was little or none of the frantic incentive-offer selling seen in the United States, making Britain a lucrative market.
Among the European manufacturers, only Renault showed healthy financial results today. Net income increased 32 percent to 1.18 billion euros ($1.35 billion) in the first half (neither Renault nor Peugeot reports quarterly results). 
But much of Renault's strength came from its Nissan stake. Excluding Nissan, Renault's operating income fell 36 percent from the year-earlier period, to 588 million euros ($673 million).
Despite the grim tidings, analysts said the companies that make most of their sales in Europe, like Peugeot and Volkswagen, were better off than companies with major exposure in the United States, like DaimlerChrysler.
"Europe is not likely to drop hugely," Mr. Maxton said. "So those companies are likely to weather the storm better than the others."

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims at Lowest Since February 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24 

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits fell below 400,000 last week for the first time since early February, suggesting a labor market on the mend.
 For the week ended Saturday, first-time claims for unemployment insurance declined by 29,000, to 386,000, the lowest since the week ended Feb. 8, the Labor Department said. 
 The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure, dropped to 419,250, the lowest since the week ended March 8, from 424,750. 
Filings for benefits had exceeded 400,000 for 22 consecutive weeks, the longest stretch since 1992, when the economy was recovering from a recession. Claims have declined since reaching a high of 459,000 in the week ended April 18.
Employment growth has been the missing ingredient in the recovery that started in November 2001, with the economy losing 1.2 million jobs since.
Bush administration officials have said $330 billion in tax cuts will help growth accelerate and bring down unemployment, which set a nine-year high of 6.4 percent in June.
Today's labor statistics were "very encouraging and consistent with other reports suggesting the economy is firming up," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management in St. Louis. "Business is starting to improve and expectations are more positive."
Government reports scheduled for release next week are expected to show that the economy added 13,000 jobs in July and economic growth quickened in the second quarter to a 1.8 percent annual rate, a number of economists said.
The number of people continuing to collect state jobless benefits declined 24,000 in the week ended July 12, to 3.605 million, the lowest since the 3.562 million in the week ended April 12. 
Claims this month are difficult to interpret because automakers close plants in July for maintenance and retooling for new models, economists said.
The government has trouble adjusting its figures for this seasonal effect, they said.
Because of that, "some caution should be used in interpreting these results," said Steven Wood, principal economist at Insight Economics in Walnut Creek, Calif.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Intel and Alzheimer's Group Join Forces

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
The Alzheimer's Association and the Intel Corporation announced yesterday that they were forming a research consortium to explore the application of computing technologies and sensor networks to the care of patients with early and advanced cases of Alzheimer's disease.
 The debilitating disease, which strips away independence from those who have it and adds an economic burden to society, is expected to grow at a much higher rate as the American population ages in the next decade. 
 According to the Alzheimer's Association, unless a cure is found, about 14 million Americans will have the disease by 2050, up from 4 million today. One in 10 people older than 65 and nearly half of those older than 85 now have Alzheimer's disease. 
The disease now costs the United States economy $61 billion a year, according to the association.
Intel executives and officials of the Alzheimer's Association sketched out a vision of existing and future computer-related devices that would be modified to permit Alzheimer's patients to live independently for longer periods, as well as elaborate monitoring networks that might help reduce the burden of caring for patients with advanced cases.
"The idea is to enhance individuals' ability to function independently," said Zaven S. Khachaturian, senior science adviser for the association. He said reliance on information technology was essential, "because warehousing people is unacceptable."
Plans call for the project, Everyday Technologies for Alzheimer's Care, initially to finance more than $1 million in research to develop systems for Alzheimer's care in the home.
The project, which will be managed by the association, will initially pursue research to develop affordable systems that can delay the effects of disabling symptoms and provide automated support to postpone the need to put patients in facilities where they require constant care.
Intel researchers cited examples like simple drill-and-practice memory systems, which might be displayed on a home television. These would help people practice recognizing co-workers, so they could hide the effects of the disease and continue to work.
For patients with more advanced cases, the researchers held out the possibility of systems that use artificial intelligence techniques to determine whether a person has remembered to drink fluids during the day.
"If it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon and the person has not gone into the kitchen or the refrigerator and the cabinets have not been opened, then it might be useful to offer a reminder," said Eric Dishman, an Intel sociologist who is a member of the company's proactive health strategic research project, based in Hillsboro, Ore.
He acknowledged that the researchers' greatest challenge was to create systems that would not compound the challenges already faced by Alzheimer's patients. "The danger is getting a confused person and making them more confused," he said.
The company has already developed a range of prototype systems and is preparing to test them with patients. One experiment would place tiny radio transmitters in shoes to help track people.
The Alzheimer's Association and Intel had independently begun exploring the use of computer technologies in connection with the disease more than four years ago when they discovered each other, Mr. Khachaturian said.
"We found out that Intel was on a similar track and were further ahead than what we had begun to do," he said. "I was impressed with what they had done and their expertise."

HEADLINE: Textile Industry Seeks Trade Limits on Chinese 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
In another sign of how American companies are struggling in the face of China's export powerhouse, a coalition of textile and apparel industry groups asked the federal government yesterday for new protections against what it called unfair competition.
 In a petition filed yesterday, the coalition pressed the Bush administration to put a cap on certain imports from China and to impose safeguards that were agreed upon when China entered the World Trade Organization. 
 Industry officials say a flood of cheap imports from China has forced some American textile and apparel companies out of business and led to the loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs.
"This industry is literally flat on its back, and if the government doesn't do something about it, we're going to disappear," said Cass Johnson, a spokesman for the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, an industry lobbying group in Washington. 
The trade dispute is one of many that have grown out of China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001. The Bush administration has been seen as reluctant to antagonize China, which is now an important trading partner and a potentially important ally in the United States' dispute over nuclear capabilities in North Korea.
At a news conference in Washington, industry officials were joined by a group of mostly Republican congressmen, who also called on the Bush administration to act.
"I have long maintained that China cheats on trade agreements," Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said in a statement. "The practices of Chinese companies and the policies of the Chinese government are illegal and give them an unfair advantage in the textile market."
Most of the congressmen at the news conference were from Southern states with large textile and apparel operations that are suffering. Some of the nation's biggest textile and apparel companies, like Burlington Industries and Guilford Mills, have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
According to the Labor Department, about 270,000 textile and apparel workers, or about a quarter of the industry, have lost their jobs over the last two years.
Commerce Department officials said yesterday that they would review the textile industry's petition. The Commerce Department is part of an interagency group that deals with textile issues tied to the World Trade Organization. If the group determines that China violated a W.T.O. agreement, the United States could place quotas on the four products the industry wants to protect: brassieres, gloves, dress gowns and knit fabric.
"If we make a determination that there's been a market disruption, we'll put a quota in place with the Chinese," said Jim Leonard, a deputy assistant secretary of commerce and chairman of the federal interagency group that deals with textiles and apparels. 
Officials in China have repeatedly disputed allegations of unfair trade in the textile market and some textile industry officials in China have threatened to call for countermeasures if the United States takes action.
Textile industry officials, however, say that China and other Asian countries are unfairly taking control of the market by keeping their currencies weak against the dollar and then dropping their prices even more to compete unfairly.
Many manufacturers in the United States complain that China has been flooding the market with underpriced goods, seeking to gain market share, and that thousands of jobs are being lost because of dumping and unfair competition.
China, which benefits from cheap labor and huge foreign investment, is now running up huge trade surpluses with the United States.
In the first five months of this year alone, for instance, China's trade surplus with the United States was $43 billion. Last year, it was $103 billion.
Since 2001, when China entered the World Trade Organization, textile officials in the United States say, China's market share in 29 textile and apparel products has jumped to 45 percent from about 9 percent. 
And in the four products cited in the industry's petition yesterday -- gloves, bras, knit fabrics and dress gowns -- China's exports to the United States soared to nearly 4 billion square feet from about 484 million, according to the textile industry.
American textile officials are now asking the federal government to put safeguards into effect that China agreed to upon entering the World Trade Organization.
According to the agreement, the United States can put a cap, or quota, on Chinese imports of certain products if there is evidence that the United States market is seriously disrupted.
Quotas on the four disputed products were lifted after China joined the W.T.O. There are still quotes on other textile imports, but nearly all of them are expected to be lifted by 2005.
Officials from several different industry groups, including the National Textile Association and the American Yarn Spinners Association, say that China could gain control of 75 percent of the United States apparel market when those quotas are lifted, unless the government acts.
"We're worried that the U.S. government won't act," said Mr. Johnson at the American Textile Manufacturers Institute. "And if China does this same thing when the rest of the quotas are lifted, this industry is history."
Industry experts, though, warned that while the United States has lost manufacturing jobs and could lose even more after the quotas are lifted in 2005, the industry picture is much more complex.
David Weil, an associate professor at Boston University's School of Management and a member of the Harvard Center for Textile and Apparel Research, said the nation's textile industry remained competitive and that many of those jobs were lost to increasing efficiencies.
"I think it's an overstatement to say it's going to be wiped off the map," he said in a telephone interview. "But is it going to be more at risk post-2005? Absolutely."

HEADLINE: FILM IN REVIEW; 
'Mondays in the Sun'

 BODY:
Directed by Fernando Leon de Aranoa
In Spanish with English subtitles
R, 113 minutes
 "Mondays in the Sun" was shown as part of this year's New Directors/New Films series. Following are excerpts from A. O. Scott's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 27; the full text is online at nytimes.com/movies. The film opens today in Manhattan. 
 Fernando Leon de Aranoa's "Mondays in the Sun," which was Spain's Academy Award nominee for the best foreign language film, is part of a trend in European filmmaking that examines, with pessimism and compassion, the present condition of the continent's working class.
The film, which looks at the lives of a group of laid-off shipyard workers in northern Spain, surveys the state of the working class in the wake of its historical defeat. The film opens with a violent protest, in which workers in their hard hats face helmeted police officers across makeshift barricades. The rest of the action takes place a few years later, when the barricades are gone and the shipyard has shut down.
The main characters, their friendships strained by envy and resentments, deal with their circumstances in different ways. Lino (Jose Angel Egido), a stout middle-aged man with a teenage son, puts on a coat and tie each morning and goes off to interview for office jobs that invariably go to younger men with skills he lacks. Rico (Joaquin Climent) has opened a bar, where his buddies run up tabs they are unlikely to pay. Reina (Enrique Villen) works as a security guard, which for some of his comrades is dismayingly close to being a policeman.
The other characters live in a state of anxious idleness, vacillating between depression and seething, impotent anger.
The movie often feels meandering and anecdotal. Having established his point vividly and early -- that unemployment entails the loss of manhood -- Mr. Aranoa is content to repeat it, sometimes humorously, sometimes bitterly. But this slow, episodic film is held together by the galvanic presence of Javier Bardem, who plays Santa, a skilled welder and the angriest and most reckless of the men. Mr. Bardem is an actor who seems able, by adjustments of posture and demeanor, to transform himself physically from one role to the next.
Here, with his heavy brow and dented nose, he moves with a heavy, taurine grace that recalls Anthony Quinn in his prime. He walks slowly, shoulders back and belly out, and his every gesture throbs with barely contained violence, which shows itself in the form of curt, brutal sarcasm. But underneath his stiff-necked bravado is terror, which Mr. Bardem conveys with his eyes and the occasional nervous flutter of his hands.
Santa sees more clearly than his friends what has happened to their lives, but his insight only compounds his sense of impotence. His small gestures of defiance, refusing to pay for a streetlight he broke during the protests and breaking another one when he finally does pay, are politically futile assertions of an identity that has been summarily taken away by forces that he can neither see nor control.
"Mondays in the Sun" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual scenes and some profanity.

HEADLINE: Roche Moves to Settle Dispute With Igen by Buying It 

BYLINE:  By HEATHER TIMMONS with ALISON LANGLEY 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 24 

 BODY:
Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, said today that it had agreed to buy Igen International of Gaithersburg, Md., for $1.26 billion -- and then give nearly the whole company right back to Igen's shareholders.
 Roche would come away from the deal with one major benefit: a perpetual license to use Igen's patented amino acid-based technology in its diagnostic tests without paying royalties. Roche already has some $370 million in annual revenue from products based on the technology. 
 But ownership of the patents and virtually all the rest of Igen's business would be spun off in a new company 100 percent owned by Igen's current shareholders. The new company would also get $155 million in working capital from Roche, plus $5 million a month in fees until a closing, expected to take place in four to six months. 
The deal, which has been approved by the boards of both companies and is subject to approval by regulators and Igen shareholders, would settle a long legal battle between Igen and Roche over royalty payments and other facets of their licensing agreement. Earlier this year, Igen won a $505 million judgment against Roche; this month, an appeals court reduced the award to about $19 million but gave Igen the right to cancel the license. Analysts said Roche had little choice but to reach some kind of deal with Igen to preserve its access to the technology through 2018, when the patents expire. 
The purchase price Roche agreed to pay, $47.25 a share, is a premium of more than 20 percent over Igen's closing price of $37.20 in regular trading today. Counting the working capital payment and the court award, which Roche agreed to pay in today's deal, the total cost to Roche would be about $1.4 billion, some 56 percent more than Igen's market capitalization at the close today. Investors bid Igen's stock up above $56 a share in after-hours trading.
Both Roche and Igen issued statements expressing satisfaction with the deal, which would end the litigation by the companies, including withdrawal of pending appeals, and would leave Igen's current management in charge of the as yet unnamed spinoff company.
The terms of the deal shocked some Roche investors, who expected the company to buy Igen outright for roughly its market capitalization. "Roche blinked," said one New York-based money manager. 
Roche did not see it that way. "I think we got a fair deal," said Franz B. Humer, the company's chairman and chief executive, in a telephone interview. The deal allows Roche to resolve "this legally and contractually highly complex dispute in the best interest of both companies and shareholders," Mr. Humer said. 
Though the deal allows Igen to license the technology to other companies as well, Mr. Humer said it took Roche eight years to develop the ability to manufacture and market products based on it, and "it's not as if somebody tomorrow can come on to the market." 
The deal would also change some other aspects of the relationship between the two companies. Igen would gain the right to enter with its own products some markets that had been off limits before, like hospitals and blood banks, while Roche would no longer have to share improvements it made to Igen's technology.
Igen and Roche have been arguing in court over royalties since 1997, and several times tried to reach a deal for Roche to acquire Igen, but could not settle on a price. Roche also tried without success to develop an economical alternative to Igen's technology. 
Analysts said that once Igen won the right to terminate the license, negotiating a new contract could have proved very costly for Roche.
In the interview, Mr. Humer reacted heatedly to suggestions that $1.4 billion may be a high price to escape paying royalties to Igen, which have run less than $100 million a year so far. He defended the often-criticized prices Roche paid in past deals, like its purchase of 60 percent of Genentech for about $2 billion, and said that the facts would bear out the company's judgment once again.
Earlier this week, Roche reported a 17 percent rise in revenue for the first half, to 13.8 billion Swiss francs ($10.2 billion). Net income fell, mainly because of investment losses. Analysts said the company had almost $20 billion in ready assets that could be used to make acquisitions.

HEADLINE: The Country Castro Will Leave Behind 

BYLINE:  By Jorge I. Dominguez; Jorge I. Dominguez is professor of international affairs at Harvard.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Fifty years of victory, 50 weeks of goodbyes: it has an appealing symmetry. It was 50 years ago tomorrow that Fidel Castro led the assault that would eventually topple the Cuban government and bring him to power. He is sure to use the anniversary over the next year to remind Cubans that while they must plan for his succession, they should not expect a new regime.
 The assault on the Moncada barracks launched Mr. Castro onto the world stage. Against all odds, he has triumphed time and again. 
 The army of President Fulgencio Batista eventually shriveled in the face of rebellion, and Batista fled on New Year's Eve 1958. Mr. Castro's militias defeated an American-sponsored exile brigade invasion at the Bay of Pigs and his secret police foiled many American-induced assassination attempts. In the 1970's and 1980's, Cuban armies did three times on African soil what the United States could not in Vietnam, nor the Soviet Union in Afghanistan: they won the wars they fought, twice defending Angola against South African invasions and once defending Ethiopia against a Somali invasion. Mr. Castro's regime survived the collapse of the Soviet Union and Communist governments in Europe.
His leadership also helped Cuba forge a strong sense of peoplehood and solidarity. Cuban schoolchildren are among the world's best performers, with Cuban fourth graders outscoring all Latin American students in mathematics tests. And the rate of infant mortality is lower in Havana than in Washington.
Much also went wrong during Mr. Castro's decades in power. In the 1960's and 70's, his government jailed more political prisoners relative to population, and held them longer in prison, than any right-wing military dictatorship in the Americas. As recently as last spring, his government imprisoned dozens of opposition activists for their "crimes" of political opinion and association. The death penalty was used repeatedly, mainly in the 1960's but also last spring, in trials woefully lacking in due process. During the 1960's, torture was an administrative practice.
Only the Communist Party is legal. National Assembly elections are uncompetitive. The government owns and operates all newspapers and television and radio stations. The economy collapsed in the early 1990's. From 1985 to 2000, per capita income fell by one-quarter. Since the early 1990's, poverty has increased, inequality has grown worse and shortages of basic necessities have spread.
Starting about a year ago, Fidel Castro began his long goodbye. The National Assembly formally opened his succession process by amending the Constitution to make it impossible to alter the regime's fundamental principles after his death. Born in 1926, Mr. Castro has been in poor health; he fainted in the middle of a speech in June 2001. His designated successor is his brother, Raul Castro, Cuba's defense minister, who is 72.
But will there be just a succession to Raul -- or will there be a wider and deeper political transition? Cuba's domestic opposition seeks a full transition. Twenty years ago, there were few activists for human rights or the political opposition. During the past dozen years, thousands have emerged.
What is striking about Cuba today is not that its government represses the opposition. It has done so for more than four decades. What's new is that the government no longer succeeds when it tries to repress the opposition. Since 1990, every time activists have been imprisoned, new members and leaders have arisen to take their places. The arrests in 2003 resemble previous episodes, except for the greater severity of the prison sentences, which are widely believed to have been imposed to keep popular opponents out of public life during this sensitive moment in history.
The battle between succession and transition is the key to Cuba's politics. In late 2002, Cuba held local and national elections. Last March, the National Assembly elected the Council of State, which will serve for five years. The assembly and the council will formally choose Cuba's next president. Also in March, six prominent activists announced a hunger strike, and the opposition lobbied the European Union to reject Cuba's application for preferential trade treatment and assistance. The crackdown on the opposition followed.
Significant elite personnel changes have also been under way. Cuba's finance minister, the party's secretary for ideology, several provincial party first secretaries, and other government and party officials have been replaced. The person in charge of economic reform, the minister of economy and planning, lost four of his six deputy ministers.
These steps are preparations for the Sixth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party, which may meet later this year or early next. The Congress will choose a new central committee and political bureau to hold office for about six years. Their members will ratify Raul Castro as Fidel's successor, and will be among the most influential in choosing Raul's successor.
Along with a few other notables, these members constitute the "selectorate" -- that is, the few hundred people who will determine the succession to the Castro brothers and its success or failure. They seek to protect the succession from the equivalent of a panicky rush on the bank that might set off a regime transition. Repression and succession are two sides of the same coin -- the currency to ensure regime survival and avoid regime transition.
Fidel Castro's long goodbye opens Cuba's most important political struggle in more than four decades. Top officials want to ensure that only they can shape the nation's future. Yet "Fidelismo without Fidel," they know, has at best uncertain prospects. This may be not just the start of Fidel Castro's goodbye, but also his regime's.

HEADLINE: All Road Maps Lead to Washington 

BYLINE:  By Yossi Beilin; Yossi Beilin was a minister in the governments of Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Ehud Barak.

DATELINE: TEL AVIV 

 BODY:
With Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel and the Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, each heading to the White House in the next few days, optimism is in the air. After all, we have an American president eager to prove that the war in Iraq can lead to an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, a right-wing Israeli leader who supports the establishment of a Palestinian state, and a Palestinian prime minister who is against the armed intifada. Also, the terrorists are holding their fire for the time being, and both sides have committed to Mr. Bush's "road map" to peace. 
 The actual situation, though, is far more complex and fragile. The quiet in the territories depends totally on the extremist Islamic groups, which have agreed only to a temporary cease-fire. Mr. Abbas, who is a prime minister without a state, lacks real control over the Palestinian security forces and has Yasir Arafat breathing down his neck. 
 In addition, the acceptance of the road map by Israel and the Palestinians may be misleading. In recent years both parties have preferred "yes, but" responses to new initiatives rather than the traditional "no, but" ones. They have welcomed every new plan -- the Mitchell report, the Tenet plan, the Zinni ideas, the Jordanian-Egyptian outline, the Saudi initiative -- but none was ever acted on. The problem with all these proposals was that no real efforts were made to explore ways to bridge the two sides' conflicting needs.
President Bush's job will be to sell a formula that would enable both leaders to continue the first phase of the road map (the cessation of terrorism and the crackdown on settlements that have been established since the Sharon government came to power in 2001) while ensuring that we make progress on the second phase, the creation of a temporary Palestinian entity with provisional boundaries, and then the third, a permanent state for the Palestinians with security for Israel, by the end of 2005.
It won't be easy. Mr. Sharon is really interested only in the second phase of the road map -- the interim Palestinian state -- while Mr. Abbas is interested only in the third, which will give him a viable nation and put an end to the Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza. 
Mr. Sharon wants to get to the second part of the road map quickly because creating a Palestinian entity covering about half of the West Bank would solve for him a huge demographic problem -- as things stand now, in seven years the Israeli government will rule over a larger number of Palestinians than Jews -- while leaving Israel a considerable part of the territories it captured in 1967. 
He has far less interest, however, in relinquishing the rest of the territories, as would be required in the third phase. Undoubtedly, he would prefer if the settlement controversy stalled the road map, keeping the embittered Palestinians perpetually in a small, economically emaciated state with no capital or claim on Jerusalem.
Mr. Abbas, for his part, is wary of falling into Mr. Sharon's trap and would love to skip the second stage altogether. He fears that if the Palestinians are given a rump state, their conflict with Israel would be transformed from an uprising of global importance into a run-of-the-mill border skirmish, and that international impetus toward completing the third stage would wane.
Thus President Bush needs to propose a new way forward that will take into account these two leaders' different desires, abilities and fears. For one thing, while each side's demands concerning removing the Israeli settlements and dismantling the Palestinian terrorist groups are essential, I see no reason that the completion of these efforts has to be a prerequisite for beginning negotiations toward the interim Palestinian state. As long as the United States feels progress is being made by both sides, why not start talking about Stage 2? As for the two sides' contradictory interests concerning the second and third parts of the road map, Mr. Bush needs to make two relatively simple pledges. Mr. Sharon needs to go back to Israel knowing that if he goes along with dismantling the settlements and the interim agreement, America will not try to dictate to Israel the final shape and status of the Palestinian state. Those must come from negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
For his part, Mr. Abbas needs to be certain that if Mr. Sharon tries to drag his feet on final-status talks in hopes that the interim agreement will become a de facto permanent solution, Washington will accept a decision by the Palestinian government to dismantle its state on Dec. 31, 2005, or any time thereafter. This is the Palestinians' trump card -- the ability to make the process start over, burdening Israel again with its demographic problem, if the Israelis don't honor their part of the bargain. 
Fair and transparent promises from Mr. Bush on these two fronts could transform the road map from a piece of paper (that both sides accepted largely to appease the United States) into a document that could resolve the most protracted international conflict of our time.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: ATTACKS; 
3 G.I.'s Killed in Ambush in Iraq

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: QAIYARA, Iraq, July 24 

 BODY:
Three soldiers with the Army's 101st Airborne Division were killed in an ambush here early this morning that involved what one local resident said was an attack by insurgents armed with rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov assault rifles.
 Military officials offered no information about who was behind the attack, and the ambush undermined hopes that the killing on Tuesday of Saddam Hussein's two sons, Uday and Qusay, would weaken resistance to American forces. 
 The attack was the second serious strike against American troops in the last two days in and around the large northern Iraqi city of Mosul, where soldiers from the 101st joined with the Special Forces in a raid that killed the two Hussein heirs as they hid out in a home in a wealthy neighborhood. On Wednesday morning, one American soldier was killed and six were wounded in Mosul when a remotely detonated bomb exploded as their convoy was driving on the outskirts of the city. 
Military officials said the convoy in Qaiyara was ambushed by small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades at 2:30 a.m. Two rocket-propelled grenades and an AK-47 rifle were found at the site, the military said.
"I heard the Americans shooting," said Ibrahim Husain, a 46-year-old farmer who lives across the road from the site of the attack. "It woke me up. They were shooting hard." Soon, he said, the Americans were searching surrounding homes. "After 10 or 15 minutes, the Americans came inside and they looked for weapons," Mr. Husain said. "They looked all over the house, and they apologized for not finding anything."
Outside the house, he said, the troops blocked off the remote stretch of road. "All over there were trucks and helicopters," he said. Mr. Husain said that he had no idea why the attack occurred, but that he doubted the assailants were from Qaiyara, a town in a barren swath of land about 40 miles south of Mosul.
Mahmoud Unis Alawy, a 30-year-old who also lives nearby, said that after the attack, "They started searching all the homes for weapons and they took some people for interrogation." At about 10 a.m., he said, the American forces towed away the wrecked vehicle, which he said appeared to be a Humvee. The troops also removed an unexploded grenade left behind by the attackers, he said.
Until this week, the region around Mosul had not experienced the same intensity of violence against American troops that had become common closer to the capital. Most of the recent deadly attacks against American soldiers have occurred to the north and west of Baghdad, in cities like Ramadi and Falluja. That area is heavily populated by Sunni Muslims, who were favored under the rule of Mr. Hussein and who now, having lost their privileged status, are particularly angered by the American occupation.
Standing on the two-lane road in Qaiyara where the ambush occurred this morning, Mr. Alawy said he was not sure what prompted the attack or whether it was only coincidence that there had been four American deaths in the Mosul area within two days of the killing of Uday and Qusay Hussein. 
Mr. Alawy said many Iraqis remained angry with the Americans for allowing the economy to disintegrate after the war. "Iraqis just sit in their home," he said. "They are angry and have no money."

HEADLINE: Dropping The Bonds 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; Nicholas D. Kristof is on vacation.; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In his July testimony to Congress on monetary policy, Alan Greenspan was cautious but -- adjusting for his usual funereal demeanor -- quite upbeat. "Although the uncertainties of earlier this year are as yet not fully resolved," he declared, "the U.S. economy appears to have withstood a set of blows. . . . Not surprisingly the depressing effects of recent events linger. . . . Nevertheless, the fundamentals are in place for a return to sustained healthy growth."
 O.K., I cheated: those quotations come from his testimony in July 2002, not July 2003. Needless to say, "healthy growth" failed to materialize. Undaunted, he said pretty much the same thing last week -- and the result was to reinforce a huge sell-off in the bond market, which may undermine the very recovery he predicted. 
 I used to be a great admirer of Mr. Greenspan. But something has gone very wrong with the maestro.
His testimony last week was surprising on several counts. There is very little evidence in the data for a strong recovery ready to break out. As far as I can make out, Mr. Greenspan's optimism is entirely based on models predicting that tax cuts and low interest rates will get the economy moving. But that's what the models said last year, too: the report that accompanied his July 2002 testimony predicted an unemployment rate of 5.25 to 5.5 percent by late 2003 (the rate is now 6.4 percent). Maybe tax cuts mainly for the affluent aren't as effective as the models say.
Meanwhile, the boost from low interest rates seems to be evaporating. Mortgage rates did indeed fall briefly to historic lows, extending the home-buying and refinancing boom that has helped keep the economy's head above water. Since mid-June, however, rates have been climbing rapidly. This week rates on 30-year mortgages hit their highest level since January.
And Mr. Greenspan bears some of the responsibility. Until June, Fed officials had helped push down interest rates precisely by not being too optimistic -- by indicating that they took concerns about deflation seriously, that they were not taking recovery for granted. Then they surprised markets with a small cut in the federal funds rate, a move that seemed to suggest that they were taking recovery for granted, after all. Mr. Greenspan's testimony reinforced that impression. 
Still, I would be prepared to forgive Mr. Greenspan's recent fumbles if it weren't for the huge fiscal damage he has inflicted on the republic in these past few years.
Let's not forget that back in 2001, Mr. Greenspan lent crucial political aid to the first Bush tax cut, arguing that such a cut was necessary to prevent, yes, excessive budget surpluses and too rapid a payoff of the federal government's debt. He should have known better -- it wasn't hard, even then, to figure out that those huge projected surpluses were largely fantasy. But he tied himself in knots to find a way to give his political friends what they wanted.
He could have redeemed himself by changing his mind once record surpluses turned into record deficits, but he didn't. Mr. Greenspan still talks about the evils of deficits, but refuses to say the obvious: that if we are ever to balance the budget again, many of the Bush tax cuts will have to be reversed once the economy recovers. Instead, Mr. Greenspan offers platitudes about spending restraint: "I would prefer to find the situation in which spending was constrained, the economy was growing and that tax cuts were capable of being initiated without creating fiscal problems." ("I would prefer a world in which Julia Roberts was calling me," Representative Brad Sherman replied, "but that is unlikely to occur.")
In short, the budget is in a mess, and Mr. Greenspan is one of the main culprits. And that, suggest some people I've talked to, may explain how he misjudged his recent testimony so badly.
Their theory goes like this: Mr. Greenspan must know that his legacy is in tatters -- at the rate things are going, history will remember him not as the maestro of the new economy, but as an accomplice in America's descent into debt. For his own self-esteem, he has to believe that things will somehow turn out all right. Thus his sudden, destructive outbreak of optimism.
It's only a theory. What isn't a theory is that Mr. Greenspan has a lot to answer for.

HEADLINE: Illinois Enacts Plan to Freeze Tuition Rates At Its Colleges 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
A new law in Illinois will freeze tuition for public university students at the level they pay when they enter as freshmen.
 While some individual colleges, like Western Illinois University and Pace University in New York, have adopted similar plans, Illinois is the first state to try the approach for its public colleges, said Travis Reindl, director of state policy analysis for the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. 
 The law, called Truth in Tuition, will take effect at the state's nine public colleges and universities in the 2004-2005 academic year. 
"The dream of a college education is something we must encourage, not discourage," Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich said on Tuesday when he signed the legislation. "Today we are doing our part to keep that dream alive."
The plan comes as financially squeezed colleges in many states have raised tuition significantly to cover rising costs and to make up for cuts in state financial support. In reaction, some federal policy makers as well as some in Illinois and other states have begun to discuss ways to hold down those increases. 
"Some of the policy makers are saying they are mad as hell and are not going to take it any more," Mr. Reindl said.
He said the Illinois plan was a new and largely untested step in tuition policy. "The underlying desire is a good one: to put predictability and stability into setting tuition," he added. "The question is how effective it will be."
State officials said that average tuition and fees at Illinois public universities had more than doubled in a decade, rising faster than the rate of inflation. This year, tuition will rise 5 percent at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and an average of 14 percent for all the state's public universities. Annual tuition at the University of Illinois this fall will be $5,568.
College officials said that their campuses were financially squeezed, but that they intended to make the new plan work. One requirement, they said, is that tuition rises enough the first year to make up for no increases in the next three years, a process known as front-loading. 
So rather than facing 5 percent tuition increases for four years, for example, students might face a 13 percent increase in their first year and no increases after that, said Chester S. Gardner, vice president for academic affairs at the University of Illinois system. The actual amounts will not be set until next year.
State Representative Kevin Joyce, a Democrat representing part of Chicago and its southwest suburbs, introduced the legislation. Mr. Joyce, 31, who entered the legislature this year, said the idea came from college students he had met while coaching football at Marist High School and who were volunteers in his election campaign. They had gone on to college but some had to drop out for a semester or longer when they faced tuition increases they could not meet. 
"It has gotten so bad, that people said that anything -- any kind of predictability -- would be good," he said. 
Under the law, students will remain eligible for the tuition freeze for four years, as long as they are continuously enrolled. Those in five-year degree programs remain eligible for five years. Students who transfer or drop out lose their eligibility.
Mr. Gardner said that the university plans to use a similar system for out-of-state students, though the law does not require it.

HEADLINE: Quick Bush Trip Raises Hopes, and Money 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., July 24 

 BODY:
President Bush visited Pennsylvania and Michigan today on a campaignlike swing that highlighted one of his greatest strengths, his ability to raise money almost at will, and one of his greatest vulnerabilities, the still-sluggish economy.
 Mr. Bush's emphasis was on the steps he has taken to reverse job loss, and he delivered the message in two big industrial states that he lost to Al Gore in 2000 but dearly wants to win next year. 
 On a day when much of Washington was focused on the release of the Congressional report on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mr. Bush sought to focus attention on his most recent tax cut, traveling to a Treasury Department building in Philadelphia where workers were preparing $400 rebate checks that will go this week to 25 million families with children. 
He then flew to Michigan, stopping at an aerospace factory to talk up signs of economic recovery before a fund-raiser here at which he raised $2 million. That brought the total take for his re-election campaign, in a little more than a month of raising money, to more than $45 million.
"We've overcome a lot because we acted," Mr. Bush told flag-waving workers in Livonia, Mich., at the Beaver Aerospace and Defense plant, which as a maker of missile and aircraft parts has benefited from the administration's buildup in military spending. "Sign after sign after sign says we're poised for growth so people can find work."
But when it came to convincing voters that good times are around the corner, Mr. Bush clearly had a sales job to do in Pennsylvania and Michigan. The unemployment rate nationally has risen to 6.4 percent from 4.1 percent when Mr. Bush took office, and joblessness is even higher in the two areas Mr. Bush visited today. In Philadelphia, the unemployment rate stands at 7.8 percent. In the Detroit area, it is 6.6 percent, and it is higher in cities, including Flint, where it is 8.8 percent.
Democrats are eager to do battle with Mr. Bush on the economy in general and jobs in particular.
"The state of Michigan has been devastated by this administration's reckless economic policies," Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, a Democratic presidential candidate, said. "Instead of creating new jobs and growing the economy, President Bush has continued down the senseless road of cutting more taxes for the wealthiest Americans."
Mr. Bush's decision to highlight the $400 child credit checks also exposed him to criticism from Democrats. They said he had done little to keep his promise to extend to lower-income families the increase in the child credit to $1,000 from $600. The checks going out this week will go only to families with incomes between $26,000 and $110,000, the level at which eligibility begins to phase out. Unless Congress acts, families making between $10,500 and $26,625, most of whom do not pay federal income taxes, will not get the checks.
Although Mr. Bush repeated today that he wants Congress to extend the credit to the lower-income group, many Republicans in Congress continue to resist, prompting Democrats to ask whether he will make a serious effort to bring his party along. 
Mr. Bush's trip today was part of a strategy to lay claim for what officials said should be a gradual economic upturn. Next week Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans and Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao are scheduled to tour Minnesota and Wisconsin to talk about how the three tax cuts Mr. Bush has signed into law will help create jobs.
Mr. Bush has summoned his economic team to a meeting at his ranch next month. And he will make trips for the next several months to talk about how his proposals, including his call for more domestic oil and gas production and his advocacy of a new approach to forest management, will help stimulate employment.
Democrats said the administration's effort to crisscross the country with the promise that things will improve was wearing thin with the electorate, especially since so much of the benefit of Mr. Bush's tax cuts has gone to upper income taxpayers.
But Republicans said Mr. Bush's policies would show results in time to allow the president and his party to avoid the fate that befell his father, whose political fortunes dimmed as the unemployment rate rose throughout the first half of 1992.
"What's most important with regard to the economy is where we are a year from now, not where we are now," said Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio.

HEADLINE: House Votes to Shift Control Of Head Start in Eight States 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday, July 25 

 BODY:
After a tense and bitter debate that ended a 38-year history of bipartisan cooperation on Head Start, the House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill early this morning that would allow eight states to take over Head Start, the largest federal program for nearly 1 million preschool children in poverty.
 The bill, formally called the School Readiness Act, has attracted broad opposition from Head Start providers around the country and from an array of child welfare organizations, who describe it as a block grant program that will open the way for dismantling the popular day care program. Republicans rejected the criticism, saying their bill would merely permit states to better coordinate their own efforts with federal day care services. 
 The bill passed 217 to 216. Twelve Republicans voted against it, and no Democrats voted for it. 
"Head Start Centers just aren't getting the job done," said Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Mr. Boehner called the bill "the first attempt in nearly 40 years to seriously address the weaknesses in the Head Start program."
Republicans faced difficulties in pulling together a majority for the bill, forcing them to delay the vote by a week and introduce a substitute version late Wednesday night. Given those difficulties, it appeared unlikely the Senate would copy wholesale the bill's most controversial provisions when it takes up Head Start.
Head Start, a creation of Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society initiatives, provides educational, nutritional, medical and other services to impoverished children in a day care setting. It also helps parents through neighborhood outreach efforts, with many Head Start teachers hailing from the ranks of parents whose children were once enrolled. 
Under the bill that passed this morning, eight governors could take over Head Start in their states in a demonstration program. States that do so must pledge not to reduce state and local money spent on preschool centers, and to maintain the level of services children receive under the federal program. 
The bill also raises the educational requirements for Head Start teachers, demanding that all teachers hired after 2005 have at least a two-year college degree, and that half of all Head Start teachers have four-year college degrees by 2008. 
The substitute bill Republicans presented Wednesday night made modest changes to win over Republicans. One change bars states that take over Head Start from shutting down existing centers for five years, unless the centers were already found substandard or did not meet a state's own criteria for preschool programs. Another change requires states to establish standards for judging how well their programs prepare children for kindergarten before joining the pilot project. Previously, the bill gave them two years to set criteria.
The bill also spells out spending caps for five years, beginning with $6.87 billion in 2004 and increasing to $7.42 billion in 2008 -- a level that child welfare advocates said would not keep pace with inflation, and would force 5,000 to 13,000 children off Head Start rolls. Republicans maintain that the increases would not mean serving fewer children. 
The Trust for Early Education, which supports parts of the bill, has nevertheless estimated that an additional $2.2 billion a year is needed to pay competitive salaries to Head Start teachers with college degrees, which is not in the bill.
The bill also allows religiously affiliated Head Start providers to consider religion in hiring decisions for jobs paid for out of taxpayer money. 
But Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked why it was so offensive for people of one religion to be forced to work with those of another, if they are receiving federal money to offer a secular service. "What is this, the Taliban?" Mr. Frank asked. He suggested the bill should be renamed "the Anti-Heretic and Infidel Association Act."
In a statement before the vote, child welfare advocacy groups, including the Children's Defense Fund, the Child Welfare League of America and the United Way called the bill "a big step in the wrong direction."
Despite the bill's demands that states continue serving at least as many children without lowering the quality of services, Representative George Miller, the ranking Democrat on the education committee, said states could still cut corners. "You can exclude 3-year-olds, you can increase the child to teacher ratios, you can run half-year programs and serve more children."

HEADLINE: Move to Reclaim Rail Line Receives Bipartisan Push 

BYLINE:  By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
City officials put aside partisan differences yesterday to forcefully push an ambitious proposal that would transform an elevated rail line spanning 20 blocks on Manhattan's West Side from an antiquated eyesore into a lush park.
 The passionate appeals by City Council Speaker Gifford Miller and representatives of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, normally political adversaries, were viewed by park advocates as a major step forward for a plan that, in less than two years, has gone from half-baked to cooked enough to require the involvement of lawyers. 
 "We believe we can turn this space into one of New York's great places," said Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff. "This is the spine, truly the vital link, that connects three rapidly evolving and exciting neighborhoods." 
Mr. Miller called the proposed 1.6-mile elevated greenway a "signature development" for New York unlike any other rail-bed reclamation project in the country.
"It is such a creative, thoughtful and exciting possibility that it's just unthinkable that we could not seize this," he said.
Though dramatic, the remarks were delivered at a hearing before an obscure federal transportation panel whose mission is far more mundane: namely, to untangle a raft of legal issues that have kept the fate of the 69-year-old railroad viaduct, known as the High Line, in limbo for more than a decade.
The panel, the Surface Transportation Board, is not expected to issue any rulings for at least a month. The project, which by some estimates could cost $65 million, would still face years of design planning, regulatory approvals and development.
A rusting incongruity, the High Line is a hulking relic when viewed from below, its promise revealed only when one ascends its verdant deck of tall native grasses and wildflowers that have taken hold since the trains stopped running in the early 1980's. It emerges from a rail yard at 34th Street and runs about 30 feet above sidewalk level south to Greenwich Village, where it ends at Gansevoort Street.
In 1992, a coalition of property owners along the corridor, arguing that the old railway was a hazardous eyesore and an impediment to redevelopment, won federal backing for a plan to tear it down, a proposal later supported by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. However, the plan never materialized because the coalition and the railroad's owner at the time, Conrail, could not agree on an ultimate price tag for demolition.
Conrail's successor, the CSX Corporation, has not taken a stand publicly on the question of whether to preserve the High Line, but has suggested it would not object as long as the company's financial interests were protected.
As attempts to raze the rail line stalled, the once-far-fetched notion of revitalizing it steadily gathered steam, and Mr. Bloomberg, in a turn-about from his predecessor, embraced the concept. The Bloomberg administration envisions a transformed High Line as an engine for economic growth in the communities through which is passes.
All sides in the issue -- the preservationists, the neighbors who have favored demolition and the High Line's owner -- are now seeking guidance from the transportation board. Whatever decision the board makes may not be final, because the city has said it would move to block any attempt to demolish the High Line, setting the stage for a protracted battle in state court.
The city's change of heart regarding the future of the High Line was cause for bewilderment by the transportation board chairman, Roger Nober, who pressed officials on what had changed since 1992.
"Back then, elected officials were saying the High Line had to come down," Mr. Nober said during the hearing at 26 Federal Plaza. "Why is it now in the public interest to maintain it?"

HEADLINE: After One Tax Increase, Some Homeowners Face Another 

BYLINE:  By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
New York City homeowners bearing the brunt of an 18.5 percent property tax increase will soon have something else to complain about: revised tax bills that will raise taxes on one- to three-family homes an additional 2.8 percent.
 The tax increase, the result of an adjustment required by state law, will reflect the increasing value of the homes relative to other classes of property. 
 The latest increase for homeowners is likely to add to the political challenges faced by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has come under fierce criticism in the boroughs outside Manhattan for the property tax increase that went into effect in January.
All told, the 18.5 percent tax increase, the adjustments and the higher assessments prompted by rising home values could result in an effective tax increase of almost 30 percent over the last year for some homeowners. They will still be paying lower taxes than their suburban counterparts, however. 
Under state law, New York City divides properties into four different groups: one-to three-family homes and small condominiums, larger residential buildings including most co-ops and condos, utilities, and commercial properties. The taxes paid by those in the first group are set well below those of other groups.
But in recent years, the value of one- to three-family homes has been increasing relative to that of properties in the other categories. New York law requires that these homeowners gradually pick up a larger share of the total tax burden. This year, that adjustment, under the state's formula, should have required an increase in the tax rate of 5.8 percent for these homeowners. 
While the State Legislature, following a pattern of recent years, voted to cap the tax increase at 2.8 percent, it deferred the rest of the increase to future years. This deferral, coupled with others from previous years, virtually ensures that city homeowners will see similar tax increases in years to come. Gov. George E. Pataki is expected to sign the legislation capping the tax increase. 
Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for the mayor, said Mr. Bloomberg had fought to limit the increase through the cap approved by the Legislature. "The modest rise in tax bills is due to increases in the value of homes and the operation of state law beyond the city's control," he said. 
Under the changes, owners of larger residential properties, including co-ops and condos, will most likely pay an additional increase of under 1 percent, while owners of commercial buildings and utilities will see taxes decline slightly or stay the same. The final rates are to be set by the City Council.
"This recent tax policy is saying, 'Sell, make money and get out,' " said Dennis Dell'Angelo, an architect and land use coordinator for the Staten Island Taxpayers Association, who has seen his tax assessments and taxes rise sharply over the last few years. "A lot of people are doing it, and you can't fault them for it."
Mr. Dell'Angelo has been building a large two-family house on the south shore of Staten Island for 13 years, and has no plans to move out. The market value set on his home by tax assessors has nearly doubled since 1999, to $958,000 from $519,000. He received a tax bill for $6,457 in June, and this will rise by nearly $200 when new tax bills go out in the fall. And because the increase in market value is phased in over several years, he will continue to pay higher taxes over the next decade or so.
Last year, the rising values of one- to three-family homes also led to an extra tax increase for homeowners as their share of the tax burden went up. So when the city approved an average 18.5 percent tax rate increase in the middle of the fiscal year, many homeowners were upset that their taxes rates had actually gone up by 22 percent, not including increases in assessed values.
"It is a definite political liability for the mayor," said Corey Bearak, a lawyer and former City Council aide who is executive vice president of the Queens Civic Congress. "I wouldn't want to run for mayor with a tax increase hanging over me."
The attached brick row house Mr. Bearak bought in North Bellerose, Queens, in 1985 for $158,000 has rapidly increased in value lately, according to City Finance Department figures, to $279,000 this year from $171,000 in 2000.
David I. Weprin, chairman of the Council's Finance Committee, who supported the tax increase, said: "I heard a lot of complaints from my constituents. It is an issue, but it is also an issue that they were going to reduce sanitation collection from two days to one and close libraries a couple of days a week." The property tax increases have prevented many service cuts, he said.
Mr. Weprin said he hoped that an improving economy would allow the City Council to roll back at least a part of the 18.5 percent tax increase.

HEADLINE: Durable-Goods Orders Soared in June, Heartening Economists

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Factory orders for durable goods surged in June, helped by spending on new equipment, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
 Orders for goods made to last at least three years increased 2.1 percent after there was no change in May. New-home sales in June rose 4.7 percent, the government reported, to a record 1.16 million annual rate, spurred by the lowest mortgage rates ever. Existing-home sales declined 0.3 percent, according to an industry group. 
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, has forecast for several months that corporate investment is on the cusp of recovery and will help the economy quicken by increasing production and incomes.
John Ryding, chief economist at Bear, Stearns in New York, wrote in a note to clients, "The improving picture for capital expenditures painted by this report bodes well for our forecast that growth will accelerate to 4 percent in the second half of the year." 
The rise in orders for durables was led by demand for automobiles and aircraft. Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, a measure of demand for business equipment, rose 0.6 percent in June after a 0.5 percent increase in May. A measure of shipments of equipment, which is used for the gross domestic product report, rose 1.3 percent, the third increase in four months.
Orders for transportation equipment gained 3.9 percent, the sharpest rise since a 22.6 percent increase in July 2002, after falling 2.1 percent in May. Orders for motor vehicles and parts jumped 2.2 percent after a 0.6 percent decline a month earlier. Aircraft orders rose 20 percent after gaining 5.6 percent the previous month.
Excluding transportation equipment, all durable-goods orders gained 1.4 percent last month after rising 0.9 percent the previous month. 
New homes account for 15 percent of all housing sales. Previously owned homes account for the rest. Homebuilding contributes 5 percent of gross domestic product and adds to growth because it creates jobs and encourages spending on appliances, building materials and home furnishings.
By region, new-home sales rose 0.9 percent in the South to an annual pace of a record 537,000 last month; gained 2.7 percent in the West to an annual rate of 347,000, the highest ever; jumped 9.8 percent in the Midwest to an annual rate of 190,000, the most since December 2002; and surged 32.3 percent in the Northeast to 86,000 homes at an annual rate.
Sales of previously owned homes ran at a 5.83 million annual pace, slower than May's 5.85 million but close to the record 5.94 million in January and December. They were expected to rise to a 6 million-unit annual pace from May's originally reported 5.92 million rate.

 BODY:
When the United States Navy officially stopped its bombing exercises on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques in May, the 9,000 islanders were overjoyed. After for more than 60 years of using Vieques for target practice and occupying two-thirds of the island, the Navy was going, leaving behind a priceless gift: 16,000 acres of untouched land that could make Vieques an unparalleled site for Caribbean eco-tourism. If development isn't handled wisely, however -- and recent plans for projects aren't encouraging -- Vieques may one day be nostalgic for the era of Navy occupation.
 That land left behind by the Navy has rolling, forested hills that rise out of the blue Caribbean. The magnificent white-sand beaches are almost deserted. With the exodus of the Navy, this area has become a national wildlife refuge, one of the largest in the Caribbean. 
 Next to the reserve is a ecological treasure, the Bioluminescent Bay, which sparkles at night because of microorganisms that glow as sea creatures brush against them -- human swimmers feel as if they're floating among the stars. The area is all the more precious because the similar bays in the Caribbean have been destroyed by pollution.
The immediate issue that Vieques has to confront is two proposed projects, both promoted by the Puerto Rican government, that would threaten the bay and the commonwealth's 1,200-acre Bio-Bay Nature Reserve that surrounds it. The first is a recreational village, the second is a fisherman's wharf. Both proposals have been greeted by protests from residents, many of whom make a living catering to the relatively small number of visitors who have braved Vieques despite the bombing runs.
The first project, a "Village in the Park" to be built directly on the beach, would prevent turtles from nesting, disrupt bird sanctuaries and sacrifice acres of mangrove to new roads and parking places. 
Similar "villages" on the main island of Puerto Rico have been ecological and social disasters, and are known as havens for noisy parties and drug dealing. This development would also create mainly temporary jobs and would compete with the small innkeepers and local families who rent rooms to budget-conscious visitors.
The second project, the wharf, would use nature reserve land for an industrial fish-processing complex with a pier and a gas station. Gasoline spills and the remains of fish cleaning would pollute the waters of a beautiful bay nearby and attract sharks and barracuda to a shallow swimming area that is now a paradise for children. The stench and the pollution would discourage tourism in the neighboring village, Esperanza.
There are alternative locations for the projects, and the commonwealth needs only the political will to move both projects to suitable locations. The recreational village could be built on oceanfront land owned by the local municipality elsewhere. The wharf could be built on the Esperanza waterfront at a site fishermen have used for 20 years.
The longer-term problem for Vieques, though, is how to preserve the environment while encouraging sustainable development. Proper planning -- taking into account residents' desires and environmental concerns -- could transform an island that has suffered years of economic stagnation. Vieques has all the prerequisites to become a prime eco-tourist destination.
Indeed, there are several eco-tourism projects under way or planned for Vieques. A handful of small inns and resorts whose builders are trying to be sensitive to their surroundings are being planned. Other businesses are seeking to encourage organic farming. These projects hold the promise of providing long-term jobs while preserving, and in some cases improving, the environment. This is the sort of development that the government should support.
Puerto Rico's governor, Sila Calderon, proclaimed that the Navy's withdrawal was "the beginning of a new era of peace and prosperity for Vieques." To make this vision become a reality, the island needs to adopt a long-range policy that prevents the destruction of natural habitat and rewards ecologically smart development.
For Vieques, partly protected from crudedevelopment by an accident of history, the environment is its greatest asset. The Navy's gift shouldn't be squandered.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Dow Hits a Five-Week High on Strong Economic Reports

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks surged yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting a five-week high, after a surprisingly strong durable goods report raised investors' confidence that an economic rebound is on its way and traders snapped up shares hit in Thursday's late-day sell-off.
 The market hovered near where it began in early trading, but staged a late-day rebound that helped the Dow Jones industrial average post its biggest one-day percentage gain since mid-June and its fourth consecutive week of gains. 
 A government report showed new orders for costly manufactured goods shot up in June at the fastest rate in five months. Orders for durable goods climbed 2.1 percent, beating forecasts for a 1.0 percent increase, and fueling optimism an economic recovery is shaping up. 
In another report, the government said sales of new homes reached a record pace in June. Sales of new single-family homes jumped 4.7 percent in June to a record seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.16 million -- surprising Wall Street analysts who had expected sales to slip to a rate of 1.12 million.
"People came in in the morning thinking sell and once they looked at the economic data, they realized it was better than expected," said Adam Tracy, director of listed trading at Thomas Weisel Partners.
Hopes that the United States' involvement in Iraq will soon wind down also gave the market a lift after the death of Saddam Hussein's sons and the capture of several men suspected of belonging to his bodyguard unit, traders said.
Those factors helped overshadow forecasts from several technology companies, including JDS Uniphase, a supplier of parts that increase the speed and capacity of fiber optic networks, and KLA-Tencor, a maker of semiconductor production equipment.
Investors also focused on the bright spots in a mixed bag of corporate score cards, including the diesel engine maker Cummins.
The Dow jumped 172.06 points, or 1.9 percent, to 9,284.57, its highest close since June 18. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 17.08 points, or 1.7 percent, to 998.68, and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 29.28 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,730.70.
The market fell sharply late Thursday on technical selling, and investors took the opportunity yesterday to nibble at beaten-down stocks.
"Every time the market backs off, it seems like buyers come back in on the dip," said James Volk, managing director of equity trading at D. A. Davidson & Company. "It's obviouspeople are looking for excuses to buy stocks."
Shares of Cummins surged $7.22, or 19 percent, to $45.16 after it reported an unexpected rise in its quarterly earnings on a rebound in diesel engine business revenue.
But after the market's strong springtime run, with the S.& P. 500 up about 25 percent from its 2003 low on March 11, a relatively solid earnings reporting period has largely left investors cold.
For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent, the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.3 percent, and the S.& P. 500 advanced 0.5 percent.
JDS shares sank a day after it reported a much smaller fourth-quarter loss and forecast falling sales amid continued weak demand in the communications industry. Its shares sank 9.4 percent, or 30 cents, to $2.85.
KLA-Tencor reported lower fourth-quarter net income and revenue and projected higher revenue in the current quarter, but its chief financial officer said he was cautious about the timing of a recovery. Shares rebounded from an initial decline and rose 31 cents to $52.44.
Pfizer reported a net loss in the second quarter versus a profit last year as costs from its acquisition in April of Pharmacia weighed on results. Pfizer shares still managed to climb 49 cents, to $33.04.
In other economic readings, sales of existing homes edged down 0.3 percent in June, while inventories jumped to the highest level in nearly 12 years, the National Association of Realtors said.
Existing-home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.83 million units from a revised 5.85 million rate in May.
Treasury prices fell yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note fell 3/32 , to a price of 95 19/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.18 percent from 4.17 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond declined 14/32 , to 103 25/32 . The bond's yield rose to 5.12 percent from 5.10 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Report Says Restaurant Jobs Unaffected by Smoking Ban 

BYLINE:  By PAUL von ZIELBAUER

 BODY:
Employment in New York City restaurants and bars has increased slightly since the law restricting smoking went into effect on March 30, according to city health officials, defying predictions from critics that the industry would be harmed. 
 City employment figures for that industry show that jobs increased to 164,900 from 155,200 between March 11 and June 11, the Health Department said. That 9,700-job increase, part of a national trend, also represents an acceleration over the same period last year in the rate of jobs created by New York City restaurants and bars, the department added. 
 The department issued the report this week in response to the New York Nightlife Association and other critics of the new law, who said that the near-ban on smoking would cause restaurants and bars to lose business and, in turn, jettison employees.
"There's no evidence of a negative impact, and if there were a negative impact, we would have seen it," said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the health commissioner. "A lot of the rhetoric in the industry is off the wall."
But Robert Bookman, the lawyer for the New York Nightlife Association, said the city Health Department's report was wrong.
"It's not the facts," he said, adding that he had researched bar and restaurant employment figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "If you compare June 2003 compared to June 2002, employment is down," a trend that dates back to at least 2001, he said. 
The Health Department's figures are "politically motivated," Mr. Bookman said. "We're not surprised that unemployment is up, and yes, we do think it's because of the smoking law."
But the majority of research seems to support the city. Studies in New York, California and elsewhere have shown that new restrictions on smoking in restaurants and bars do not result in a drop in business. 
"What New York City is experiencing is entirely consistent with what we've seen all across the country, which is that the predictions of people going out of business are baseless," said Russell Sciandra, director of the Center for a Tobacco Free New York, who has lobbied for smoking restrictions. 
Dr. Frieden, and the Bloomberg administration, anticipated charges that the ban would harm restaurants. At a news conference the day the city law went into effect, the commissioner noted that on average, three bars and restaurants fail each day in New York City. 
"I'm sure that as of today," he said, "they're all going to be our fault."

HEADLINE: At 50, the Korean Truce Defines a Generation Gap 

BYLINE:  By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, July 25 

 BODY:
For Joo Sung Ro, a 72-year-old veteran of the Korean War, the truce that ended the conflict half a century ago heralded an age of prosperity for South Korea, and an era of a divided Korean people.
 The armistice served as a bittersweet reference point for the men and women of his generation. Its 50th anniversary, coming Sunday, made Mr. Joo reflect on a North Korea that, to him, has remained unchanged and on his own society, which seems to be changing beyond recognition. 
 "We cannot resolve any problems by talking with Communists -- that's my experience," said Mr. Joo, a retired colonel. "When Communists are weak, they want to talk. When they are strong, they want to invade other countries. There should be another war against North Korea, the same way the United States succeeded in Iraq and Afghanistan."
No doubt his words would have sounded jarring in the fashion center of downtown Seoul. None of the young South Koreans randomly interviewed had heard of the celebrations marking the anniversary of the truce. They also blamed the United States, not North Korea, for causing the crisis over the North's nuclear weapons program.
"The United States is interfering too much in our relationship with North Korea," said Kim Min Jung, a 24-year-old university student. "But we cannot help accepting the United States because it is too strong."
The anniversary of the armistice has exposed the deep divisions in South Koreans' perceptions of North Korea, the United States and the current crisis. Many of the divisions are generational, pitting older South Koreans, who saw this country democratize and prosper under the security alliance with the United States, against younger South Koreans resentful of the presence of 37,000 American troops here.
Those divisions reached a peak last December as President Roh Moo Hyun was elected amid a large-scale protest movement against the American forces. But they began taking shape especially under former President Kim Dae Jung's policy of rapprochement with the North, known as the "sunshine policy."
"The sunshine policy was supposed to change North Korea," said Lee Jung Hoon, a professor of international relations at Yonsei University here. "But it has not changed North Korea at all. Instead, it has changed South Korean society, and its attitudes toward issues like reunification, North Korea and the U.S."
The truce will be commemorated Sunday in Panmunjom, a village near the border with the North where the armistice ending the three-year war was signed on July 27, 1953. Officials and veterans from here and the nations that supported the South in the United Nations force are scheduled to participate.
The commemoration, which will take place within a short distance of North Korean soldiers standing watch across the world's most heavily guarded barrier, is a reminder that the armistice was never followed by a peace treaty. The nuclear standoff has only emphasized the fact that the two nations are still technically at war.
When North Korea and their Chinese backers signed the armistice 50 years ago with the United States -- against the wishes of South Korea, which wanted to keep fighting lest a truce mean the continued division of the peninsula -- the two Koreas were not so far apart economically. North Korea was actually richer, more industrialized; the South was largely agricultural.
Today, in contrast to the impoverished, isolated North, the prosperous, democratic South is a society in rapid transition, a fact made clear by the different attitudes toward the anniversary of the armistice.
Younger South Koreans, having grown up in an era in which school textbooks no longer portrayed North Koreans as devils with horns and tail, appear less distrustful of the North Korean government. At the same time, their mistrust of American motives and actions has grown.
Chae Hee Byung, 37, is chairman of the Pan-Korean Committee on the Girls Killed by U.S. Armored Vehicles, a private group formed last year after two schoolgirls were crushed to death by a military truck and the drivers were acquitted. For Mr. Chae, the armistice has never led to a peace treaty because the unresolved conflict allows the United States to station its troops here and extend its influence in the region.
"When we have had the chance for better relations with the North," he said, "the United States has blocked it."
Similar comments could be heard in downtown Seoul's fashion area, even on a corner with a McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts, and Billy Joel's song "Uptown Girl" blaring out of a clothing store.
"The United States is more dangerous than North Korea," said Jung Hyun Sun, a 24-year-old store employee, wearing hip-hop clothes and an earring. "They are actually ruling South Korea with the excuse that they are protecting us."
To Mr. Joo, the retired colonel who fought alongside American soldiers in the war, such ideas were incomprehensible. He was a staunch supporter of United States policy toward North Korea and a critic of President Roh's softer approach. To him, no South Korean could possibly hold anti-American sentiments. They were, he said, infiltrators from the North.
Then, amending his comment, he said of the tens of thousands who had participated in anti-American demonstrations last year: "Only 1 to 3 percent of the demonstrators are really anti-U.S. The rest are not anti-U.S. from the heart. They're just following their friends."

HEADLINE: Tentative Deal Set on Budget In Connecticut 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 25 

 BODY:
After nearly a month in which the state has had to operate without a budget, leaders of the Connecticut House and Senate said todaythat they had the makings of a deal that would close the state budget gap with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.
 And though many details were not disclosed, the deal they have put together is likely to spread the pain around. Childless welfare beneficiaries are losing at least $18 million in annual support, while the very wealthy will be facing a potential state inheritance tax next year even if Washington phases it out on the federal level. 
 Both sides were at an impasse when the new fiscal year began on July 1, forcing Gov. John G. Rowland to issue executive orders to cover vital spending needs for each week that the budget crisis remained unsolved. 
Republicans were holding out for more spending cuts, while Democrats pushed the governor and his fellow Republicans to tax the wealthy to bridge a $100 million gap separating them. Governor Rowland had resisted efforts to single out the wealthy.
Both sides were reluctant to divulge much about the plan out of fear that it would collapse. "It's still at a very tentative stage," said Julie Cammarata, policy director for the state's budget office.
But it is clear that both parties gave ground in the budget, which may be voted on by the middle of next week.
For starters, the deal they have discussed is likely to take a big swipe at the $130 million in annual general assistance benefits that some 4,900 unemployed, single adults receive from the state, legislative aides said. Gone entirely would be the $300 a month in cash that these beneficiaries now get, which aides say would save $18 million in the current fiscal year. These beneficiaries would also be expected to participate in managed care programs for health and mental benefits, which could potentially save millions more, according to legislative aides.
In addition, the maximum property tax credit that many middle-class residents now get on their state tax returns may shrink at least 20 percent from the current $500, and wealthy taxpayers could completely lose eligibility, aides said.
In a concession he had long resisted, the governor also agreed that he might continue the state's inheritance tax even if the federal government eliminated its version of the tax. He has agreed to allow the state to continue taxing large estates in the next fiscal year if he is unsuccessful in prying loose at least $125 million in additional aid from Washington or if other shortfalls develop.
Aides said the governor held the line against raising the state's sales tax from 6 percent, which Democrats had wanted but which business had fought.
The mayors of Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport huddled behind closed doors with legislators today to learn how much of the roughly $2.2 billion that the state now dispenses in aid might be lost under the deal. Their cities are among the biggest beneficiaries of state aid. Hartford's mayor, Eddie Perez, told The Associated Press that his city might have to lay off 45 police officers who only joined the force today if the flow of state money ebbed.
Democratic strategists claimed victory in that they had quashed efforts by Republicans to pass a one-year budget only, after years in which the state has passed two-year budgets. Republicans, meanwhile, comforted themselves that they had fought back at least part of the effort to single out anyone making more than $1 million a year.
"These are people who have money to invest, who are taking risk to bring jobs here," said Richard Belden, a deputy minority leader for the House. "It doesn't take a whole lot of them to relocate to New Hampshire or Florida for six months and a day to lose it all. So, to drive the rich out of the state is the wrong way to go."
Both sides were unable to come to terms as recently as Wednesday. But the governor invited them back on Thursday for what turned out to be a marathon session late into the night.
At that meeting, participants say, Democrats realized that many towns and cities and nonprofit groups whose needs were not being met by the weekly executive orders could not function much longer without a budget. "To run the state on weekly executive orders is no way to run a business," said Moira Lyons, the speaker of the House.
Republicans, meanwhile, said they realized that the governor's popularity ratings were dropping in the polls and that it would be hard for him to hold the line against efforts to demand more from the rich.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE INQUIRY; 
Classified Section Of Sept. 11 Report Faults Saudi Rulers

BYLINE:  By DAVID JOHNSTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
Senior officials of Saudi Arabia have funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to charitable groups and other organizations that may have helped finance the September 2001 attacks, a still-classified section of a Congressional report on the hijackings says, according to people who have read it.
 The 28-page section of the report was deleted from the nearly 900-page declassified version released on Thursday by a joint committee of the House and Senate intelligence committees. The chapter focuses on the role foreign governments played in the hijackings, but centers almost entirely on Saudi Arabia, the people who saw the section said. 
 The Bush administration's refusal to allow the committee to disclose the contents of the chapter has stirred resentment in Congress, where some lawmakers have said the administration's desire to protect the ruling Saudi family had prevented the American public from learning crucial facts about the attacks. The report has been denounced by the Saudi ambassador to the United States, and some American officials questioned whether the committee had made a conclusive case linking Saudi money to the hijackings. 
The public report concluded that the F.B.I. and C.I.A. had known for years that Al Qaeda sought to strike inside the United States, but focused their attention on the possibility of attacks overseas.
The declassified section of the report discloses the testimony of several unidentified officials who criticized the Saudi government for being uncooperative in terrorism investigations, but makes no reference to Riyadh's financing of groups that supported terror.
Some people who have read the classified chapter said it represented a searing indictment of how Saudi Arabia's ruling elite have, under the guise of support for Islamic charities, distributed millions of dollars to terrorists through an informal network of Saudi nationals, including some in the United States.
But other officials said the stricken chapter retraces Saudi Arabia's well-documented support for Islamic charitable groups and said the report asserts without convincing evidence that Saudi officials knew that recipient groups used the money to finance terror.
The public version of the report identified Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi student who befriended and helped finance two Saudi men who later turned out to be hijackers. 
Mr. Bayoumi helped pay the expenses for the men, Khalid Almidhar and Nawaq Alhazmi. Mr. Bayoumi, the report said, "had access to seemingly unlimited funding from Saudi Arabia." The report said Mr. Bayoumi was employed by the Saudi civil aviation authority and left open his motivations for supporting the two men.
The Saudi ambassador to the United States has angrily denied that his country failed to cooperate with the F.B.I. and C.I.A. in fighting terrorism and has dismissed accusations that it helped finance two of the hijackers as "outrageous."
Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador, said in a statement after the report was released on Thursday that his country "has been one of the most active partners in the war on terrorism, as the president and other administration officials have repeatedly and publicly attested."
Prince Bandar dismissed the report's assertions about Saudi involvement in the hijackings.
"The idea that the Saudi government funded, organized or even knew about Sept. 11 is malicious and blatantly false," Prince Bandar said. "There is something wrong with the basic logic of those who spread these spurious charges. Al Qaeda is a cult that is seeking to destroy Saudi Arabia as well as the United States. By what logic would we support a cult that is trying to kill us?"
He added: "In a 900-page report, 28 blanked-out pages are being used by some to malign our country and our people. Rumors, innuendos and untruths have become, when it comes to the kingdom, the order of the day."
Asked to comment on the report today, a Saudi Embassy representative said Prince Bandar was out of town and could not be reached.
Today, a senior Democratic senator wrote to President Bush asking for the White House to demand that the Saudis turn over Mr. Bayoumi, who is believed to be residing in the kingdom.
"The link between al-Bayoumi and the hijackers is the best evidence yet that part of official Saudi Arabia might have been involved in the attacks," said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York. "If the Saudi royal family is as committed to fighting terrorism as it claims, it will turn this guy over to U.S. officials immediately so that we can finally get to the bottom of his role in the attacks and his links to Al Qaeda."
Behind the immediate issue of whether Saudi Arabia played any role in terrorism are a complex web of political, military and economic connections between the two countries. Successive Republican and Democratic administrations have aggressively sought to maintain the relationship with a huge producer of oil and an ally in the Arab world.
One section of the report took issue with Louis J. Freeh, the former F.B.I. director, who testified to the joint committee that the bureau "was able to forge an effective working relationship with the Saudi police and Interior Ministry."
The report quoted several senior government officials, who were not identified, expressing contradictory views. One government official told the panel "that he believed the U.S. government's hope of eventually obtaining Saudi cooperation was unrealistic because Saudi assistance to the U.S. is contrary to Saudi national interests."
Another official said: "For the most part it was a very troubled relationship where the Saudis were not providing us quickly or very vigorously with response to it. Sometimes they did, many times they didn't. It was just very slow in coming."

HEADLINE: A Big Tax Cut For Business Is Proposed In Congress 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
The chief Republican tax writer in the House introduced a big new tax cut for businesses today, a proposal that would reduce the top rate to 32 percent from 35 percent for small companies, provide other benefits for manufacturers and add about $120 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years.
 The bill, offered by Representative Bill Thomas of California, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is meant to replace an existing tax break for businesses that export overseas. That subsidy has been ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization, and the United States faces $4 billion in sanctions from Europe if it is not repealed. 
 Mr. Thomas's proposal, however, is more than three times as large as the tax break it would replace. He said the extra tax cuts were necessary to reform an antiquated business tax code and create jobs. A similar bill was introduced in the Senate today by Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. 
Democrats said it was reckless to be so generous with tax benefits for businesses at a time when the federal budget deficit had grown to record levels and in a week when House Republicans refused to expand the child tax credit for low-income families, a step whose 10-year cost would be $3.5 billion. 
"The supporters of this bill seem more interested in budget-busting tax cuts for multinational corporations than in protecting American jobs," said Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, a Democratic presidential candidate.
The bill would require 60 votes to pass the Senate, and it is so expensive that it could probably not summon even a majority there unless tax writers found a way to minimize the effect on the deficit. In fact, the measure has yet to gather significant support in Mr. Thomas's committee or among the House leadership.
The Ways and Means Committee's top Democrat, Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, who has proposed a rival bill that has greater bipartisan support, said the "Christmas tree of tax breaks" that Mr. Thomas was offering to businesses would so weigh down the legislation that a solution to the export subsidy problem might not be reached until next year. By then, Mr. Rangel said, Europe may decide that the United States is not serious about ending the subsidy, and may slap billions in tariffs on American products.
Democrats expressed outrage that Mr. Thomas proposed the business benefits on the day the Bush administration was beginning to mail $400-a-child checks to 25 million middle-class families, while not giving the same credits to 6.5 million families earning the minimum wage. Throughout the day, Democrats in both houses held news conferences and made statements on the floor to denounce the stalemate that has held up the checks for poor families, saying the contrast illustrated Republican economic priorities.
Senator Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat whose son is an Army sergeant, said 200,000 military families were among the group of minimum-wage earners who were left out of the legislation expanding the child tax credit.
"Many military personnel who left their families behind to fight America's wars will themselves be left behind by this Congress," Mr. Johnson said on the Senate floor. "It doesn't matter how many speeches we give thanking them for their service and lionizing their courage and acclaiming their patriotism. A single mother who has been deployed to the Middle East for the 50th week running cares a lot more about getting her check than she does hearing from us how much we appreciate their sacrifice."
In addition to reducing the top rate for companies earning less than $10 million -- the vast majority of American businesses -- Mr. Thomas's bill would increase corporations' ability to depreciate assets and to increase credits for research and development. Although repealing the export subsidy would save the government about $50 billion over 10 years, enactment of the new bill would mean a net cost to the Treasury of $120 billion over the same period.
Mr. Thomas said that fixing the tax code for exporters and manufacturers could not be done without spending money.
"You're dealing with 40 years of neglect in the tax code," he said. "Although revenue neutrality is always a good starting point, you have to take a look at where and how we have to change that antiquated tax code. The world has changed since 'Lawrence of Arabia' won best picture."

HEADLINE: Leader of Major City Union Faces a Re-election Fight 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The president of New York's main union of social workers announced yesterday that he would challenge Lillian Roberts for the leadership of District Council 37, setting up what is likely to be the closest election battle at any large New York union since the 1980's.
 Charles Ensley, whose local represents 15,000 social workers, announced his candidacy in a telephone interview, saying that District Council 37, the nation's largest municipal union, had ineffectual leadership and needed a change. 
 Mr. Ensley fiercely criticized Ms. Roberts, who for 17 months has been executive director of the 125,000-member council, a group whose diverse membership also includes accountants, clerical workers, sewage treatment workers and zookeepers. His union is one of 56 union locals in District Council 37, an umbrella group that negotiates for those locals. 
"D.C. 37 is not being effectively led," Mr. Ensley said. "This is not about personal ambition. It's about the union. Once upon a time, D.C. 37 used to be the premier union in the city, respected by all. Unfortunately, we don't think that's the case now."
Mr. Ensley, 62, said he would compete with Ms. Roberts to secure a majority of the 300 union delegates who are scheduled to choose an executive director in January. 
Ms. Roberts, 74, was overwhelming elected executive director last year to help re-establish the union's power and integrity after it was rocked by scandals in the mid-1990's involving ballot-stuffing and millions of dollars in embezzlement. 
"Certainly we expect to win," said Mr. Ensley, who is president of Local 371 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the district council's parent group. Mr. Ensley is viewed by many labor experts as more confrontational than Ms. Roberts, taking her to task, for instance, for not doing enough to prevent layoffs. 
In a telephone interview, Ms. Roberts said she planned to run for re-election. But she declined to say anything to promote her candidacy, insisting that campaign remarks would be inappropriate when she is seeking to negotiate a new contract for her members with City Hall.
Suggesting that aggressive campaign oratory would divide the union and undermine its bargaining efforts, she said, "I'm trying to negotiate the best possible contract for our members in the most difficult economic times since the 1970's." 
Mr. Ensley said he was declaring his candidacy now because Ms. Roberts appeared to be contacting delegates to round up support. She denied that she was campaigning, but said many delegates have been approaching her to pledge support.
Lenora Gates, a delegate and executive vice president of Local 1549, the District Council's largest local, representing nearly 25,000 clerical workers, said she was backing Ms. Roberts to assure continuity. "I believe she's brought some credibility back," she said. "She has the knowledge. She has the experience." 
Mr. Ensley disagreed with her appraisal, saying: "We have lost ground under this administration. If we judged Ms. Roberts and her administration to be an effective, aggressive, militant administration, we would not be running."
At District Council 37, no candidate has mounted a major challenge for the top position since the 1970's. At the United Federation of Teachers, representing 80,000 New York City teachers, there has not been a tight race in more than a generation. 
At 1199/S.E.I.U., the city's largest union, representing 240,000 health-care workers, the last major races were in the 1980's, when Dennis Rivera won the presidency after two aggressively fought campaigns, including one in which the former president was accused of rigging ballots.
In the 1960's and 1970's, Ms. Roberts served as District Council 37's chief organizer and eventually its No. 2 official, under Victor Gotbaum, developing a reputation as a militant and a firebrand. She ultimately quit to become state labor commissioner.
In February 2002, Mr. Ensley and nearly all other presidents of union locals at the council enthusiastically backed Ms. Roberts, optimistic that she could use the popularity she developed at the union decades earlier to heal its many wounds and rifts.
But yesterday, the district council's No. 2 official, Mark Rosenthal, the treasurer, said he would back Mr. Ensley. "I'm for Charles because Lillian has no record," said Mr. Rosenthal, who is also president of a union local representing city drivers and park workers. "She's done everything wrong. My members don't have a contract, and they don't see any viable plan for one right now."
Mr. Rosenthal was Ms. Roberts's running mate, but now plans to run for treasurer on Mr. Ensley's slate.
Defending her bargaining record, Ms. Roberts said that none of the city's other municipal unions have reached contracts with the city in the new round of bargaining.

HEADLINE: Do Aid Studies Govern Policies Or Reflect Them? 

BYLINE:  By DAPHNE EVIATAR 

 BODY:
When President Bush promised to channel billions of dollars in aid -- but only to countries that were committed to "ruling justly, investing in their people and encouraging economic freedom" -- it was an extraordinary example of how an idea hatched by scholars could wend its way into mainstream politics.
 The plan, which Mr. Bush announced as the Millennium Challenge Account at the 2002 United Nations International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico, was largely based on the work of two economists, Craig Burnside and David Dollar. After completing an elaborate statistical analysis, they concluded that yes, foreign aid did promote economic growth, as long as the recipient government had solid fiscal, monetary and trade policies in place; their article, "Aid, Policies and Growth," was published in The American Economic Review in 2000. 
 But new research that uses the same methodology, though more up-to-date and comprehensive data, says those findings don't hold up. "We no longer find that aid promotes growth in good policy environments," write three researchers: William Easterly, a former principal economist at the World Bank who is now an economics professor at New York University; Ross Levine, a finance professor at the University of Minnesota; and David Roodman, a research associate at the Center for Global Development in Washington. 
In a forthcoming article, also for The American Economic Review, these authors do not claim to prove that aid is ineffective, but they do argue that "policymakers should be less sanguine about concluding that foreign aid will boost growth in countries with good policies."
Because the new research has not yet been published, it is too soon to say just how influential it will be. But the conflicting studies highlight the often fraught and puzzling relationship between the world of professors and the world of politics. Why can one study trigger the flow of millions or even billions of dollars while another, equally valid work sits on the shelf? Often, the answer is that that is the way policymakers want it.
Mr. Burnside and Mr. Dollar's work caused a sensation when their paper first began circulating, in 1997. Ever since President Harry Truman, at his inauguration in 1949, announced a "bold new program" to alleviate world poverty, economists and others had been trying to figure out how to use aid to turn poor countries around. Here, finally, seemed to be the answer.
Soon, the British and the Canadian development agencies began saying that the idea that foreign aid reduced poverty in countries that were well governed was backed up by solid research. Most important, the Burnside-Dollar study became the cornerstone for a 1998 World Bank report that White House officials cite as the "key study" supporting the Millennium Challenge. Steven Radelet, who helped design the Millennium Challenge program as a deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury from 2000 to 2002, said that Mr. Burnside and Mr. Dollar's work was unusually influential, partly because it "resonated with an idea that a lot of development practitioners had come to believe, independent of the research."
Research that confirms what policymakers already believe is, not surprisingly, going to have greater impact than research that does not. As the economist Henry J. Aaron noted 25 years ago in his study of the Great Society programs, "Research reflects prevailing moods at least as much as it influences them."
Mr. Levine said of the Burnside and Dollar study: "It gave a reason for foreign aid and a strategy for giving it out. That's great for one paper. People grabbed this like I've never seen any other academic article grabbed before. It became the pretext for why the World Bank exists, and for the Millennium fund. One of the reasons for the World Bank is to funnel money to less developed countries and have them grow faster as a means for alleviating poverty. So it's nice to have evidence that suggests the money is linked to growth and hence the alleviation of poverty. Prior to the Burnside-Dollar finding, it was difficult to make that claim."
As Mr. Easterly chronicles in his book "The Elusive Quest for Growth: Economists' Adventures and Misadventures in the Tropics" (M.I.T. Press, 2001), for decades economists have been on an "audacious quest" for the magic formula that would make poor countries rich. Yet each time they thought they had found the elixir, he writes, they were disappointed.
Whether it was more investment, better technology, lower birth rates, broader education or debt relief, each once-fashionable theory of how to end third world poverty has ultimately fallen flat. Sub-Saharan Africa, the area most tended to by Western economists since their search began, has barely grown at all. Although some directed forms of aid have been highly effective -- like health programs providing oral rehydration therapy or vaccinations for children -- the key to the overall development puzzle has remained a mystery. 
"When you're talking about development, you're talking about wholesale transformation of a society," Mr. Roodman said. "You're trying to recreate the history of the Western world over the last 200 years, to put other countries through that process. No one knows how to do that."
Even if someone did, it would be tough to prove on paper. Cross-country statistical studies may be inaccurate because, as Mr. Dollar pointed out, "there are a relatively small number of countries in the world" and so many potential variables. For one thing, aid is not always aimed at promoting growth. During the cold war, for example, much of American foreign aid was funneled toward American allies in the fight against Communism, regardless of its likely effect on development. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the amount of American foreign aid has declined, and its focus has shifted.
As Mr. Radelet, now a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, noted: "Our two largest aid recipients are Israel and Egypt. The main reason for that aid is to support the Camp David Accords, not for economic development."
He continued, "In the last two years we've provided huge amounts of foreign aid to Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt and Turkey because they are frontline states in the war on terrorism."
Even when aid does seek to promote development, though, how recipients spend it is only part of the story. Mr. Easterly stressed problems on the donor end: "You have bloated, inefficient bureaucracies that don't really know what they're doing as far as achieving results," he said in an interview. He compared agencies like the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank to "companies that get no customer feedback." The customers are the poor, and the poor often have little say in their own governments, let alone in international organizations, he said, adding, "It's as if Hollywood was making movies but never had any information about ticket sales."
So people look at the latest research -- but only to a certain extent. 
Mr. Burnside, who is now an economics professor at the University of Virginia, called the Easterly study "a significant challenge to our results" because it was the only one that used a very similar methodology. Still, he added, "the notion that among poor countries aid should be allocated to those with better institutions and policies has gained currency not because of any single statistical study, but rather because several different types of information all point in the same direction." (The two authors, who were both economists at the World Bank when they published their article, are working on a new paper responding to their critics.)
The Bush administration, for its part, does not seem particularly concerned about the latest findings. A senior White House official familiar with the new paper dismissed the dispute as "a statistical issue" that does not alter the soundness of the government's approach.
Few economists would disagree that policymakers should consider how governments are likely to use aid money. Dani Rodrik, professor of international political economy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, called the basic philosophy of the Millennium Challenge Account sound. "We have learned that attaching policy conditions to aid is futile when the recipient governments are uninterested in generating economic growth and poverty alleviation," he said.
But he added that there was still no magic formula for growth. China, India and Vietnam, for example, have all been economically successful in the past two decades, he said, but would not have passed the criteria set out by the Millennium Challenge Account. Trying a one-size-fits-all foreign aid policy "presumes not only that we have a fairly good idea what growth-promoting policies are, but also that these policies are the same everywhere," Mr. Rodrik said. "Neither of these presumptions is supported by evidence."

HEADLINE: Bush, With Palestinian Prime Minister, Urges Compromise 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
President Bush received the new Palestinian prime minister at the White House today for the first time, and he used the occasion to signal to both Palestinians and Israelis that he would push them toward tough decisions for peace.
 After meeting in the Oval Office with the prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, Mr. Bush said that they had held forthright discussions about the most sensitive issues between the sides and that the issues would be discussed again when the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, visited the White House on Tuesday. 
 The president suggested that he was supportive of the Palestinians on one topic raised by Mr. Abbas: Israel's construction of a security fence that is cutting into Palestinian areas on the West Bank. But he said the onus was on Mr. Abbas to clamp down on terrorist activities by Palestinian groups, and he rebuffed calls by Palestinians for Israel to release as many as 6,000 prisoners it is holding, many accused by Israel of taking part in terrorist activities. 
Mr. Bush noted that the United States had recently provided a $20 million grant to the Palestinian Authority for economic development in the occupied territories, and he announced that he would send Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans to the region this fall to develop specific plans to create jobs and attract investment.
"This is the time of possibility in the Middle East," Mr. Bush told reporters in the Rose Garden, with Mr. Abbas at his side. "And the people of the region are counting on the leaders to seize opportunities for peace and progress."
Having concluded that the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, is not serious about coming to a peaceful solution in the Middle East, Mr. Bush has promoted Mr. Abbas as a reformer with the courage to lead his people toward an independent state and coexistence with Israel. But after nearly three months in office, Mr. Abbas is still solidifying his position and dealing with deep strains within the Palestinian leadership over how far to go in accommodating Israel.
"Some steps have been taken by Israel so far, but these steps remain hesitant," Mr. Abbas said. "The new era of peace requires the courageous logic of peace, not the suspicious logic of conflict."
Mr. Arafat met at least 20 times with Bill Clinton during Mr. Clinton's two terms as president. Mr. Bush has never met with Mr. Arafat, and the only previous Palestinian official to visit the Bush White House was Mr. Abbas's finance minister.
For Mr. Bush, today's meeting continued a deepening involvement in the Middle East and furthered his role as a go-between for Mr. Abbas and Mr. Sharon. The president noted that Mr. Sharon had chosen today to signal a willingness to address more of the demands of the peace proposal, known as the road map, that has been the basis for the most recent effort to end the violence.
Mr. Sharon's government said today that it would take a number of steps intended to reassure the Palestinians, including withdrawal of troops from two West Bank towns, removal of three roadblocks that have choked traffic and an increase in the number of work permits issued to Palestinians for employment in Israel. Mr. Sharon's government also said it would "consider ways to reduce as much as possible infringements by the security fence on the Palestinian population's daily lives."
Answering questions from reporters after the White House meeting today, Mr. Bush offered some support to both sides but also made clear that he would press them to make painful compromises. Asked about Israel's construction of the security fence, Mr. Bush replied, "I think the wall is a problem."
Mr. Bush said that he had raised the matter before with Mr. Sharon, and that the Israeli prime minister was willing to discuss it in Washington next week. "It's very difficult to develop confidence" between the sides, Mr. Bush said, "with a wall snaking through the West Bank."
On the subject of Palestinian demands that Israel release prisoners, Mr. Bush appeared sympathetic to Mr. Sharon, who has agreed to release more than 500 of the 6,000 prisoners but none "with blood on their hands."
Mr. Bush said prisoner release should be considered case by case. "But I would never ask anybody in any society to let a prisoner out who would then commit terrorist actions," he said.
The president also indicated that while he would push Israel to adhere to the requirement of the road map that it dismantle recently built Jewish settlements, he also saw resolution of the broader issue of the settlements as dependent on Mr. Abbas's ability to curb terrorism.
"I've constantly spoken out about the end of settlements," Mr. Bush said, apparently referring to the required dismantling of settlements established since March 2001, when Mr. Sharon took office. "And I'm going to tell you point-blank that we must make sure that any terrorist activity is rooted out, in order for us to be able to deal with these big issues."

HEADLINE: Head Start Overhaul Passes in House but Faces Senate Hurdle 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
The House passed a bill to overhaul Head Start by the narrowest of margins early today, and the Senate appeared increasingly unlikely to adopt the House's controversial blueprint for handing over control of the program to eight states.
 The bill passed 217 to 216, with 12 Republicans voting against it and no Democrats voting in favor. 
 Two Democrats, Representatives Ed Pastor of Arizona and Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who is running for president, missed the vote, while Republicans brought in Representative John Sullivan of Oklahoma, who had been in a car accident on Wednesday, to reach a majority. 
"Bringing in someone at the last minute is a tough way to run a vote," said Megan Farnsworth, an education fellow at the Heritage Foundation. "It is obviously a clearly contentious issue, and with such a tight vote, it's more likely the Senate will shy away from it." 
Under the House bill, eight states could take over Head Start as part of what the bill calls a demonstration program. States that participate maynot reduce their spending on preschool centers and must pledge to maintain the level of services children currently receive under the federal program.
The bill has come under fierce attack from Head Start parents and providers around the country and from an array of child welfare organizations. They contend that the demonstration program would ultimately dismantle Head Start's elaborate system for ensuring quality.
Head Start, created in 1965, provides educational, nutritional, medical and other services to impoverished children in a day care setting. It also helps parents through neighborhood outreach efforts, with many Head Start teachers coming from the ranks of parents whose children were once enrolled in the centers.
The House bill raises the educational requirements for Head Start teachers, demanding that all teachers hired after 2005 have at least a two-year college degree, and that half of all Head Start teachers have four-year college degrees by 2008. 
In an effort to win over moderates and conservatives, the bill would not allow states to close existing Head Start centers for five years, with some exceptions. It also sets spending limits through 2008 that child welfare advocates complained would not keep pace with inflation, and could force 5,000 to 13,000 children off the Head Start rolls. Republicans contended that no fewer children would be served.
Tom Mann, a political analyst at the Brookings Institution, said Representative Michael N. Castle, the moderate Republican from Delaware who sponsored the Head Start bill, was generally liked and trusted in the House. "The fact that Castle is having some difficulty tells you the extent to which there is support for the program," Mr. Mann said.
A spokesman for Mr. Pastor's office, Maura Saavedra, said the congressman had to fly home to Phoenix after his father suffered a health emergency, thus missing the vote.
Erik Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Gephardt, said the candidate flew to South Carolina at 6 p.m. "It was unclear whether the Head Start vote was going to come up at all," Mr. Smith said.
In any event, a spokesman for Representative Tom De Lay of Texas, the majority leader, said Republicans had "two or three" votes in reserve that would have assured victory.

WHEN he was a boy living in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn in the late 1950's and early 60's, he and his friends would take the D train to Yankee Stadium to see their favorite team play. Young Chuck loved the Yankees. The Dodgers and the Giants had absconded to Los Angeles and to San Francisco, the Mets were barely a gleam in Bill Shea's eye, and the Yankees were the only team in town.
 His favorite players in that era were Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra. And Roger Maris. Mantle and Berra are in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Maris is not. 
 Charles E. Schumer, now a United States Senator from New York, believes this is a grievous oversight and should be corrected as soon as possible.
Taking time away from such away-from-the-diamond issues as the Mideast, Iraq, Iran, the economy, federal judicial nominees and potholes, Schumer turned his attention to this perceived injustice and recently issued a statement from his office in support of Maris's enshrinement.
"He played with grit and determination, but was also a class act," Schumer said. He recalled that he had intently followed Maris and Mantle's pursuit of Babe Ruth's single-season home run record, which Maris broke with 61 homers in 1961. Maris was named the American League's most valuable player in 1960 and 1961. 
"You ask anyone who followed the Yanks in those days, and they'll tell you Maris belongs in the Hall of Fame," Schumer said. "I asked Jim Bunning" -- Bunning, Republican from Kentucky, is the only Baseball Hall of Famer in the Senate -- "and he thinks Roger should be in the Hall of Fame, too."
Why is Schumer campaigning for Maris now? After all, the Veterans Committee of the Hall of Fame -- which votes on previously passed-over older players and executives -- doesn't meet again until March. "I wanted to get a jump-start on the voting for Roger," Schumer said by telephone from Washington the other day. "Let the Veterans Committee begin thinking about it now, with the attention of the ceremonies in Cooperstown this weekend." 
Gary Carter, the Expos and Mets catcher, and Eddie Murray, the Orioles, Dodgers, Mets and Indians first baseman, are being inducted into the Hall of Fame tomorrow.
Maris, while close, does not have the overall credentials to be a Hall of Famer. Without question, Maris, who died in 1985 at age 51, was a superb hitter, fielder and base runner, and a popular player among his teammates, if not consistently with the news media. He had a reputation for being surly, though I found him to be genuine and candid. But personality or character issues should not play a role in election to what ought to be consideration based solely on performance on the field. 
There are only nine retired players who won back-to-back Most Valuable Player awards. "Other than Maris and Dale Murphy, every one of them is a Hall of Famer," Schumer said.
He admitted, however, that Maris's 12-year career statistics fell somewhat short of those of other Hall of Famers, as well as those of other worthy candidates. Maris hit 275 home runs, had 851 runs batted in and had an unimpressive .260 batting average. He never batted over .300, never hit more than 39 home runs in any season other than 1961, won just one Gold Glove and was named to just four All-Star teams.
One of the pleasurable aspects of following baseball is that arguments over the merits of various players past and present can never be conclusive. Like holding up a mirror to nature itself. Gray areas often dominate.
But on the face of it, players like relief pitcher Bruce Sutter, and the sluggers Jim Rice and Andre Dawson, who finishedthird, fourth and fifth in the most recent balloting for the Hall of Fame, are more deserving than Maris -- longer careers, better numbers. For example, Rice, who got 52.2 percent of the sportswriters' vote, played 16 seasons, hit 382 homers and had 1,451 runs batted in and a .298 batting average, far superior to Maris's numbers. Rice won one M.V.P. award and was an eight-time All-Star.
Don Mattingly and Thurman Munson, to name two Yankees, have stronger credentials than Maris. Murphy, Cecil Travis, Stan Hack, Dummy Hoy, Carl Mays, Tony Oliva and Ron Santo, as well as Tommy John (288 victories), Bert Blyleven (287) and Jim Kaat (283 victories), among several others, have claims at least as strong as Maris's for the Hall of Fame.
Shortly before the Veterans Committee voted this year, Schumer issued a news release promoting Gil Hodges, the Dodgers first baseman and the manager of the 1969 Miracle Mets, for inclusion in the Hall of Fame.
"Hodges may have stronger credentials than Maris for the Hall of Fame," Schumer said, "but I think both should be in it. I remember when I was a kid, and Hodges was retired and living on Bedford Avenue, my friends and I would go by his house on Halloween and get candy for trick or treat. He was a great guy."
As a politician, Schumer has artfully covered all local bases -- that is, Yankees, Mets and Dodgers. Yet there is a believable passion to his Hall of Fame urgings, even if, from my view, he is on relatively shaky ground. No need for him to don a New York team cap to establish credentials. Unlike another United States Senator from New York, he is no Roger-come-lately Yankee.

HEADLINE: Author Clinton Shakes Many Hands and Sells Many Books 

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
Defying the odds on blockbuster books by celebrities and public officials, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's memoir, "Living History," is now certain to cover its near-record $8 million advance and begin earning her royalties, her publisher said yesterday. 
 Booksellers say the book owes its success partly to the public's enduring fascination with the Clinton White House and partly to Senator Clinton's status as a dual symbol of female victimhood and power. 
 But sales of "Living History" also testify to Senator Clinton's own unusual, indefatigable efforts to promote it, stirring questions about the possible combination of competitive, political or financial ambitions behind her book tour.
As first lady, Senator Clinton used a mechanical device to sign copies of her previous book, "It Takes A Village," donating her proceeds to charity. But since the June 9 release of her memoir, "Living History," Senator Clinton has personally signed more than 20,000 books by her own estimate, appearing at more than 17 store events around the United States and others in London, Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam. 
Senator Clinton has sometimes signed until she can no longer move her hand. At a Wal-Mart in Virginia, a volunteer administered a vigorous rubbing to revive it. Senator Clinton soaks it in ice or wears a wrist-support to recover.
"Signing 1,500 books in an hour and a half is not an easy thing to do while you are shaking hands with everybody, and she has continued to do it with great enthusiasm," said Carolyn Reidy, president for adult books at Simon & Schuster, Mrs. Clinton's publisher. 
Ms. Reidy said the publisher was itself surprised by the immediate and continuing velocity of the sales, and she attributed the relatively sustained pace partly to Senator Clinton's energetic salesmanship.
For her part, Senator Clinton said, "It is exhausting, but it is also wonderful and very rewarding."
"Obviously, I am tremendously moved by the responses that I have received both personally and from the number of people who have bought the books," she said in a telephone interview yesterday from Washington, shortly before flying to a book signing in Little Rock. 
Including proceeds from the advance sales of foreign rights, Senator Clinton needs to sell about 1.35 million copies to recoup her advance with hardcover sales alone, Ms. Reidy said. As of last week, Simon & Schuster had reports from bookstores of at least 1.2 million copies sold in the United States, with sales at a rate of more than 50,000 a week, making it almost certain that the book's sales will exceed the advance when royalty checks are cut in September, Ms. Reidy said.
Unlike most other nonfiction -- and especially unlike most books by U.S. government officials -- "Living History" has also become the No. 1 best seller in France, Germany,England and Ireland and made best-seller lists in Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands. On Friday, Romania become the 28th country where Simon & Schuster has sold the rights. 
Ms. Reidy said foreign sales are likely to pay Senator Clinton further royalties, and she can look forward to additional royalties from the United States paperback sales. 
Senator Clinton will receive her first royalty check around February. The royalty rate is about 15 percent of the cover price, or about $4.20 from each hardcover book. Last week's sales would earn her more than $210,000, although sales are slowing.
It is very rare for a celebrity author to recoup the advance and receive royalty payments, especially before factoring in paperback sales. In the economics of the book business, publishers often make enough money from blockbuster books to make a profit, even if the percentage earmarked for royalties never covers the advance.
To the astonishment of a legion of literary and political pundits, this book may have been a bargain for Simon & Schuster. But Robert Barnett, the lawyer who handled the sale for Senator Clinton, said, "We used the free enterprise system in its purest form -- the auction -- and it yielded a fair price." 
Its success was very hard to foresee. Her sales have already nearly doubled the reported sales of Barbara Bush's memoir, "Barbara Bush: A Memoir," and more than tripled the sales of Nancy Reagan's best-selling memoir, "My Turn." Senator Clinton's "Living History" has far outsold Senator John McCain's best-selling memoir and campaign book, "Faith of My Fathers." 
With 1.2 million copies sold in six weeks, she is pulling up behind General Colin Powell. His memoir, another book that sparked speculation of a run for the presidency, has 1.6 million hard-cover copies in print after eight years.
Asked whether she set out to cover her advance, she said, "I am sure in the long list of motivating factors, it might be down there somewhere." But, she added, "I really just wanted to do the best job I could with the book, and I told the publisher that obviously, given this very large advance, I would certainly promote it."
Senator Clinton said she did not feel competitive with her husband's autobiography, expected next year, and predicted that it would probably outsell hers.
It is impossible to know the appeal of any book, perhaps especially one that many critics described as a thin, self-serving account of a potentially riveting story. 
Several stores said women outnumbered men nearly two to one at recent book signings, and in Boston, Pasadena and elsewhere, supporters lined up before dawn.
"She had it down to boom, boom, boom," said Norma Pierson, 55, an insurance broker and Clinton supporter who lined up outside Vroman's bookstore in Pasadena. "You got the handshake, got the book, got a joke or a word or something. It was great."
Reader reviews on Amazon.com suggest others bought "Living History" just to fling it across the room. "If you don't want to add to the reported income of the book sales, buy the book used, check it out from the library, or borrow a copy -- I did," one reader wrote in a review on Amazon.com.
Some at the signings had more mercenary motives. Many unread, signed copies are available for sale on Internet auction sites for prices of more than $90 a copy.
She said she saw plenty of men at her signings as well as women, and she also saw a lot of support for with her positions. "It is a book as much about the public policies and the progressive agenda that I have championed all these years as it is about my life, because it is part of who I am."
The book tour has given Senator Clinton an opportunity to reintroduce herself in the relatively favorable context of discussing her story rather than political issues. Mrs. Clinton denied for the millionth time that she was campaigning for president. "That is not in the cards," she said. 
Senator Clinton said she had worked hard to fashion her book tour around her Senate schedule. On one occasion, she shuttled to Washington in between stops in New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore.
But complying with Senate ethics rules also means her publisher picks up much of the tab for her appearances, including paying a quarter of the salary of one of the aides who travels with her. (If she conducts fund-raising or other business, the publisher shares the cost.) One executive at Simon & Schuster said the cost of the book tour might approach $1 million.
Terrance Finley, a spokesman for Books-A-Million, a bookstore chain concentrated in the southern states, said the book had exceeded expectations, though sales had trailed the national trends. 
He notes that Mrs. Clinton is only beginning to promote the book in the South. "Like always with books, if the author is willing to really work it, it makes all the difference in the world, and she certainly has done that."

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT ORDERS TROOP DEPLOYMENT TO LIBERIAN COAST 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
President Bush gave orders today for a naval amphibious force that includes 2,300 marines to sail from the Mediterranean and nearby waters to a position off the coast of Liberia, but left vague what its specific mission would be.
 The timing of the announcement caught Pentagon officials off guard, and sent them scrambling to explain that three ships carrying the marines could be off the Liberian coast within a week or so, in position to support 1,300 Nigerian peacekeepers who are committed to enforcing a cease-fire and delivering aid to victims of the civil war there. 
 Mr. Bush, speaking to reporters at the White House, said he had ordered American forces a step closer toward intervening in the long-running war that has left hundreds dead in recent months because conditions in Liberia were deteriorating rapidly. 
"We're deeply concerned that the condition of the Liberian people is getting worse and worse and worse," he said. "Aid can't get to the people. We're worried about the outbreak of disease."
Mr. Bush's decision is an important symbolic move, but falls far short of actually sending American troops ashore. It appeared to be an effort to walk a careful line between the Pentagon's reluctance to put American lives at risk and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's argument that the United States must not appear to be sitting on its hands.
"We do have some obligation as the most important, powerful nation on the face of the earth not to look away when a problem like this comes before us," Mr. Powell said earlier this week.
Mr. Powell's aides say the United States and the United Nations may have missed their best opportunity two weeks ago, before the attacks on Monrovia, the capital, began.
One aide said, "The president is convinced that we need to be in position should the opportunity present itself again." 
Before he traveled to Africa earlier this month, Mr. Bush demanded that Liberia's president, Charles G. Taylor, step down before any American troops go in because he is the central, polarizing figure in the war there. His failure to leave has angered the president, aides say, and has acted to paralyze Washington's Liberia policy. Mr. Bush met with his top national security aides today to end that impasse and step up pressure on Mr. Taylor, Bush aides said.
"It is very important for Charles Taylor to leave the country," Mr. Bush told reporters today during a White House Rose Garden appearance with the Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas.
Mr. Bush said the Pentagon would determine exactly how the American forces would help the African peacekeepers. But the timing of his remarks and a statement earlier from the White House surprised defense officials in Washington and Europe, who plan military missions in Africa. "We were really blind-sided," one defense official said.
Two amphibious ships carrying marines, the Iwo Jima and the Carter Hall, are now in the Mediterranean and could reach Liberia in about a week, defense officials said. A third ship, the Nashville, is several days behind the other two.
The marines aboard belong to the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, based at Camp Lejeune, N.C. Pentagon officials say they want to limit their involvement to providing logistical, intelligence and communications support. But the Marines also bring artillery and light-armored vehicles, as well as transport and attack helicopters that could be used to provide security for peacekeepers.
The White House statement said only that the American military's role "will be limited in time and scope as multinational forces under the United Nations assume the responsibility for peacekeeping and as the United Nations arranges a political transition in Liberia."
Being deliberately vague about the American military role allows Mr. Bush to put more pressure on Mr. Taylor, but also allows him to maintain the flexibility to monitor events in Liberia and determine what help the Nigerian peacekeepers need.
It also allows the president to straddle two competing political camps: conservatives in Congress who are suspicious of sending American troops on a mission that sounds to them too similar to Somalia, and liberals and religious groups who have urged Mr. Bush to address the desperate needs of a nation founded in 1847 by freed American slaves.
"I'm glad they've decided to move closer to Liberia, but I'm disappointed it's taken so long," said Representative Donald M. Payne, a New Jersey Democrat who is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. "Had we gone in a month ago, we could have been way ahead on humanitarian assistance."
A senior administration official said Mr. Bush's decision was intended to speed action by the Economic Community of West Africa States, which has committed the two Nigerian battalions.
"They weren't moving quickly, and it was clear that the humanitarian situation was moving south," the official said. "We want to fix this -- but you have to work with the countries in the neighborhood."
The official added that the West African group seemed to be waiting for a signal from the United States that it was ready to help militarily, "so there was something of a stalemate, everyone waiting for everyone else."
Military representatives from the West African organization, joined by American military attaches, have been meeting for weeks in Dakar, Senegal, but have failed to resolve the final size and makeup of the African peacekeeping force.
Pentagon officials said they were still trying to determine details of any proposed mission, and raised questions about what would happen if Mr. Taylor did not leave or no West African peacekeeping force actually became a reality.
Mr. Bush said today that the United Nations would take charge of Liberia's long-term political and security needs. "Finally, we're working very closely with the United Nations," he said. "They will be responsible for developing a political solution. And they will be responsible for relieving the U.S. troops in short order."
The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, said in a statement today that he was "very pleased" about Mr. Bush's decision.

Dozens Die in Monrovia Battle
MONROVIA, Liberia, July 25 (Reuters) -- Mortar shells pounded Liberia's capital today in fighting that killed 23 people and wounded about 200. Afterward, rebels declared an immediate cease-fire but vowed to defend their positions.
The fighting today represented an escalation in the seesaw battle for the capital. Mortar shells struck a school where hundreds of refugees had sought shelter and hit near a medical treatment area.

 EVIDENCE OF
THINGS UNSEEN
By Marianne Wiggins.
383 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $25.
 Ray Foster first sees Opal upside down, a shimmering reflection in the iridescent glass bubble that swirls at the tip of her father's blowpipe. A self-taught science adept, Fos has been driving through a hard rain to the North Carolina shore to count shooting stars for a home-brewed hypothesis about light. His truck sputters and dies outside the glass workshop. Sturdy, right side up and no longer shimmering, Opal marches out, opens the hood, dries the magneto and gets the engine going.
Shooting stars and iridescence, and a wiped-down engine. They are among the counterings of soul and body, of immortal longings and mortal contrivance, in one of the most suggestively original love stories in our current fiction. These pairings serve a broader design as well, one that runs from World War I to the development of the atomic bomb. They stand as the moral poles of an individual, for whom tinkering American idealism is gradually flattened by the impersonal weight of technology and economic concentration.
Marianne Wiggins has written something approaching an epic, and it could have been dangerous. She is a writer who takes wild risks of style and story. She gets where she's going by going too far, and that can mean going too far the wrong way. 
Her novel "John Dollar" was a rending, mesmerizing novel of eight girls marooned on an island. Its beauty left its readers all the more defenseless against its horror. There was a splendid short-story collection, "Herself in Love." Two more recent novels -- written a few years after a fatwa-forced existence hiding out with Salman Rushdie, then her husband -- claimed sweeping imaginative territory, but made awkward if fitfully brilliant efforts to occupy it.
There is roughness in "Evidence of Things Unseen," an occasional grandiloquent reach beyond its fictional grasp. Rarely, you sense Wiggins spurring her story to lift it to the next stage, or chivying a sentence to snare a sublimity. This time, though, she has schooled her winged horse to transport human riders.
Even with their epic stirrings her characters are wryly, plangently particular. When their voices soar, it is from the grit of country speech. The journey of Fos and Opal through America's 1920's, 30's and 40's is up and down and eventually downhill, matching the author's sense of the course taken by our national virtues. But it is a discursive, resilient descent; one that arouses in the reader, along with sadness over what is being lost, exhilaration that it ever existed.
Fos begins in 1918 as one of a bunch of North Carolina recruits in the American Expeditionary Force in France. They went "for valor, decency and hell like they'd never known." With no detectable join, Wiggins merges this Appalachian twang with something darker and larger. "Not one among them who survived was proud of it in any way that didn't cast a shadow back across his pride." 
Light, Fos volunteers when recruiters ask what he is good at. His untutored passion, speculative and mystical, is for starlight, phosphorescent plankton, lightning bugs, radium: natural, not man-made, illumination. Naturally, since the shortest military distance is a broken line, two British officers "with more brass than a church organ between them" (twang again) put him in a workshop making fireworks and colored flares to light up the trenches. "So that the boys could see what they were shooting at. See death coming, when it came."
Fos's wartime friendship with the unit's photographer, nicknamed Flash, leads to partnership in a photography business in Knoxville. When he's not working in the studio he tours county fairs, putting on fireworks displays and letting customers examine the bones of their feet in his portable X-ray machine. His passion, though, is tinkering with notions about phosphorescence; in particular the thought that it increases when the night sky is at its brightest. 
Thus the trip to the coast, timed to the Perseid meteor shower. His truck, with a sign reading "Phenomenologist" (he figures it ought to mean someone who investigates phenomena), carries the X-ray machine and a jar of fireflies whose performance is to be measured at the height of the shooting-star display.
Nature has other things than light, though. It has rain, and it has love. Fos had left this last to Flash, an exuberant woman-chaser, while he chased his scientific speculations. Opal changes all that. Their wet meeting at the truck, she wiping, he noticing, she noticing his noticing; also, accidental brushings of arms, a loose button and a Perseid shower of casually exploratory yet charged remarks: these ensnare the reader almost as thoroughly as the couple. We do not so much read as eavesdrop.
In a few hours Fos and Opal are lying on the beach in Kitty Hawk, where lovemaking mingles with star counting. She works as a bookkeeper, so she does the counting. She is the practical one, he the awkward celestial idealist; and the distinction runs through the book even while periodically dissolving. He's been out in the world and seen a war; by contrast to her crimped small-town life, he offers a welcome if drifty openness. "As much as she was headstrong, single-minded and self-made, she could see a vision of herself taking shape in Fos's eyes that she liked better."
Fos marries Opal and takes her to Knoxville. It is a while before she and Flash can be comfortable with each other. She is serious and he is a tearaway, but he comes to recognize the radiance in her solemnity, and she the pain (he has broken with his family: rich, bigoted and the town's aristocrats) in his wildness. A triangle of loyalty and trust takes shape. There is work (her practical talents revive the photography shop), picnics, rowing and fishing on the river, and afternoons of talk.
The idyll doesn't last but, through tragedy and transformation, the three figures somehow do. Disasters accumulate. Flash is jailed after getting a young girl in fatal trouble. Opal and Fos's life collapses; they leave town to take over the farm of a cousin crushed by the deaths of his wife and child. Neither has any idea how to manage. At night, hardly able to speak, they can only hold each other.
Then the new Tennessee Valley Authority hires Fos to talk up electrification at county fairs, and later to document rural life in Walker Evans-style photographs. Progress has rescued them -- at a progressively mortal price. Dams submerge the farm; they move to housing and jobs at the Oak Ridge atomic bomb project, set up on vast tracts of T.V.A. land.
Their lives, once shaped by their quirks, dreams and contrivances, are subject here to a chilly regimentation. Science, which for tinkering Fos means the exploration of spirit and possibilities, serves here a lethal purposefulness. Lethal to both of them as well, in a fashion too splendidly and paradoxically intricate -- as are so many of the book's other movements -- to detail. Years later, in a kind of epilogue, their orphaned son will go on a quest for them. It is a quest for a lost America.
If satire is what closed Saturday, saga, in modern times, is what sags like Thanksgiving's balloon giants. Wiggins keeps hers aloft, for the most part, with potent, well-aimed jets of breath: the lifting jerk and veer of agile human moments.
The patch of moisture that appears on a lab worker's gauze mask when he speaks. Opal, rowed on the river, registering the creaking oarlocks as if she were "being lofted by the ball and socket action in the wings of a giant bird." A bereaved farmer with the expression seen "in certain kinds of people of an iron reserve who never cry. They end up looking like they've cried too much." Flash, out of prison, holding to a salvific memory from the guilty catastrophe that put him there: "A lover's gaze is like having your portrait painted by a master and then being able to look into it, stare at it for as long as the love lasts -- or for the rest of your life."
A half-dozen years ago, two of our masters experimented with panoramic novels: Philip Roth with "American Pastoral" and John Updike with "In the Beauty of the Lilies." Wiggins lacks their mastery, their agility, their breadth and craft. Yet I find in "Evidence of Things Unseen" an urgency they lack, a passion to hurl herself into a continental unknown, to seek, misstep, recover and push on, while noticing every grass blade along the way, that seems to me the mark of a true epic endeavor.

Pattern Recognition

BYLINE:  By Laura Miller 

 BODY:
Feeling alienated from contemporary architecture is a commonplace experience: the pleasure that leaches out of your afternoon stroll when you have to walk along a big building with a flat, smooth, featureless front; bafflement at another magazine spread celebrating a conglomeration of soul-less boxes. So it's surprising that social critics (besides the ever-canny Tom Wolfe) haven't had more of a field day with the topic. In this underfought war, there's even a ready-made hero in the person of Christopher Alexander, an architect who was born in Vienna, raised in England and now lives in California, and is something of a prophet without honor in his own profession. 
 Alexander produces the kind of books every serious reader should wrestle with once in a while: fat, challenging, grandiose tracts that encourage you to take apart the way you think and put it back together again. Depending on whom you talk to, they're either canonical or completely off the reservation; among architects, he has some devoted followers and plenty of scornfully dismissive critics, particularly among the champions of the avant-garde. "A Pattern Language" and "The Timeless Way of Building," two seminal works he wrote with five colleagues, have continued to sell well since they were first published in the 1970's, but despite his position as emeritus professor of architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, their influence on his profession (outside the continuation of some of his ideas in the New Urbanism movement) has faded. Instead, laypeople use "A Pattern Language" to design their own homes, and "The Timeless Way of Building" has been a major influence on, of all things, a school of software engineering called object-oriented programming. 
 Even people who aren't building a house or constructing a database are fascinated by "A Pattern Language," a recipe book of "patterns," or archetypal elements that can be combined to form a structure as small as a desk or sitting area or as large as a city or region. The patterns, distilled from (mostly premodernist) examples all over the world, are what the authors believe best foster the comfort, activities and social lives of the people who live in them. To use a key Alexander word, these patterns help make a building "alive." The book is easiest to digest if you read its 253 numbered sections in reverse order, from smallest to largest, since most of the thinking on regional and urban planning reflects the starry-eyed utopianism of its day: nice, but wildly impractical, politically and economically. Some of the more nuts-and-bolts patterns, however, have become architectural rules of thumb: "Balconies and porches that are less than six feet deep are hardly ever used"; "When they have a choice, people will always gravitate to those rooms that have light on two sides." In a profession that seems indifferent to the concerns and delights of ordinary life, Alexander has always been a humanist, a proponent of window seats, sunny spots and arcades.
Last year, Alexander began the publication of "The Nature of Order," his four-volume magnum opus, the second volume of which appears next month. An unclassifiable work, "The Nature of Order" offers the results of his quest to figure out what underlying principles make his patterns work. It has some of the same qualities that make "The Timeless Way of Building" and parts of "A Pattern Language" a tricky sell to hardheaded empiricists wary of any whiff of the metaphysical. Clearly influenced by Taoism, Alexander unabashedly uses words like "wholeness"and complains of the prevailing Cartesian "mechanistic" view of the universe. "The Nature of Order" has vast ambitions; it floats a hypothesis that Alexander hopes will lead to "a new view of space and matter" and to a different conception of "the fundamentals of the way the world is made." This theory, very crudely summarized, would be based on the understanding that order is inherent in space and systems and that they are more or less "alive" based on the quality of the order they manifest.
That precis alone is probably enough to send some readers fleeing to the new Janet Evanovich novel, but it would be stupid and shortsighted to write Alexander off as a fuzzy-minded New Age philosopher. He did leave me unpersuaded that what he calls "life" is a property of the physical universe, but I am convinced, after reading the first two volumes of "The Nature of Order," that at the very least, "order" as he meticulously defines it is fundamental to human cognition, which makes it important enough. Besides, as with all of Alexander's writings, "The Nature of Order" is so firmly grounded in the visual, palpable world that it can never be accused of drifting off into cloud-cuckoo-land. And then there's his unsettling tendency to be right.
TO make his case, Alexander repeatedly uses a flexible and eloquent tool: he presents two images -- a pair of buildings or drawings or household objects or country roads -- and asks the viewer to choose the one that has the most "life." (Sometimes he asks which one is "a better picture of the self.") The quintessential pairing asks people to choose between a diner-style saltshaker and a bottle of the best-known brand of ketchup. According to Alexander, 80 percent of the people asked choose the saltshaker, and his experiments with other pairings along these lines yield similar results; when asked to pick which of two images looks most "right" in some vague way, a great majority of respondents gravitate to one -- which does make you wonder if the question really is as vague as it seems. Even if it's hard to agree with Christopher that a science comparable to physics can be created out of such responses, following his argument amounts to being shown how to see art and the world by a man with one of the most developed senses of beauty I've ever encountered. In wending my way through his image-packed books, I found myself looking harder at photographs -- of Turkish carpets, Moroccan mosaics, Japanese temples, ginkgo leaves, soap bubbles, postmodern houses, you name it -- than I have looked at anything in a long time. Afterward, I saw familiar objects and places with new eyes -- not as momentous as a new science, I'll grant you, but a revelation all the same.
