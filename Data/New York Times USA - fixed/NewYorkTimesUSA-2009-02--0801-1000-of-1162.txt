HEADLINE: Despite Kyrgyz Vote to Close U.S. Base, Gates Explores Options to Keep It Open

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and ELLEN BARRY; Thom Shanker reported from Krakow, and Ellen Barry from Moscow.

DATELINE: KRAKOW, Poland 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Thursday that the United States might consider increasing payments to Kyrgyzstan for access to a crucial air base, just hours after the Kyrgyz Parliament voted to terminate the lease and require the Americans to vacate the base within six months.
 ''We have not resigned ourselves to this being the last word,'' Mr. Gates said at a meeting here of NATO defense ministers to discuss the need for more combat forces and reconstruction teams in Afghanistan. 
 The base, in Manas, plays a central role for NATO's Afghan mission. It provides transit facilities for thousands of personnel and 500 tons of cargo each month, and it is used by the tanker aircraft that refuel fighter planes on missions over Afghanistan. The Obama administration has called the war there a high priority, announcing this week that an additional 17,000 American troops would be sent in the coming months. The loss of the base is seen as a serious challenge. 
 Mr. Gates said the United States remained prepared to discuss with Kyrgyzstan whether larger fees were warranted for use of the base, but he cautioned, ''We are not going to be ridiculous about it.''
 ''Manas is important,'' he said, ''but it is not irreplaceable.''
 He said that American negotiators already were deep into discussions with ''a number of different countries,'' including Russia, about alternatives to the logistics hub in Kyrgyzstan.
 It remained unclear how quickly the United States would have to find an alternative. President Kurmanbek Bakiyev of Kyrgyzstan was expected to send Washington an official notice, but American officials said they still did not know when it would be received or when the six-month countdown would start.
 The bill in Parliament was approved by 78 of the 81 lawmakers present, with two voting against it and one abstaining. 
 The Kyrgyz government in Bishkek had longstanding complaints about the base and had asked for more cash compensation. Tensions were exacerbated in 2006 when an American serviceman fatally shot a Kyrgyz truck driver. 
 Mr. Bakiyev announced the move to close the base at a news conference with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, who this month promised to shore up Kyrgyzstan's struggling economy with about $2.15 billion in loans and grants. Moscow has long complained about the continued American military presence in Central Asia, and many in Washington concluded that Russia had encouraged the move in an attempt to assert its dominance in the region.
 Although Russian and Kyrgyz officials say there was no connection between the Kremlin's financial aid and efforts to kick out the Americans, senior American officials have complained that the Russians are trying to have it both ways -- with the Kremlin expressing a desire to support the international military mission in Afghanistan while pressing the Kyrgyz government to end American access to its air base.
 In public comments as part of the vote, Kyrgyz lawmakers portrayed the action as the culmination of years of complaints and said the American presence in Central Asia had outlasted its usefulness. 
 ''It is impossible to make people of Afghanistan live by standards which are brought in from abroad,'' said Kabai Karabhekov, a member of Parliament. ''One has to give an opportunity to Afghan people to build their country themselves.''
 The shadow of Russian actions in Central Asia and Central Europe fell over the session of NATO ministers here, as Mr. Gates also was pressed on whether the Obama administration intended to move forward with a plan for missile defenses in Europe that had been a priority of the Bush administration's foreign policy and that had brought threats of military retaliation from Russia.
 Mr. Gates, in his first overseas trip since he began serving the new president, said the missile defense bases planned in Poland and the Czech Republic would proceed if the technology proved it could work and was affordable.
 Neither of those two caveats were part of the Bush administration's language when discussing requirements for the bases.
 But Mr. Gates also made it clear that the Obama administration had not yet met on the issue of missile defense policy, and that no decisions had been made on how to proceed.
 ''The administration has not yet reviewed where it is on a whole range of issues,'' Mr. Gates said, including the missile defense program and how to manage that within the relationship with Russia.
 Mr. Gates said the radar proposed for the Czech Republic and the 10 interceptor missiles for Poland were to counter a potential threat from Iran, and he reiterated that the United States would work with NATO and wanted Russia as a partner in the effort.
 To reassure his hosts here, Mr. Gates said that a series of new bilateral military cooperation efforts with Poland were proceeding even as the prospects for the missile defense site on Polish territory remained uncertain.
 Also Thursday, NATO officials confirmed that Germany had pledged 600 more soldiers to the mission in Afghanistan.
 ''We welcome the commitment of additional German forces for the upcoming Afghan national elections,'' said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary. ''For those contests to be credible, voter turnout must be robust and representative, and improving the security situation is the key to making that happen.''
 Italy announced this week that it would add 500 troops to the alliance mission in Afghanistan by April.

HEADLINE: Times Co. Suspends Its Dividend To Raise Cash

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The New York Times Company suspended dividend payments to shareholders on Thursday for the first time in four decades as a publicly traded company, another in a series of concessions because of sharply lower newspaper revenue. 
 The decision by the board pre-empts a dividend payment that, on the usual schedule, would have been paid later this month. The annualized savings is just $34.5 million, because the dividend was already cut sharply last fall.
 ''Today's decision provides the company with additional financial flexibility given the current economic environment and the uncertain business outlook,'' the company chairman, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., said in a statement.
 In May 2007, the company raised its quarterly dividend to 23 cents a share, from 17.5 cents. Newspaper advertising had already begun to slump by then, and the decision was second-guessed by some analysts.
 The industry's troubles steadily worsened through 2007 and 2008. The Times Company's overall revenue last year fell 7.7 percent, and its newspaper ad revenue dropped 14.2 percent.
 In November, the company cut the dividend to 6 cents, the lowest it had been since the 1980s.
 Cash flow remains positive, but it is shrinking, and the company faces significant debt payments over the next 13 months, so it has taken several steps to raise cash. The company is seeking a sale-leaseback of a portion of its headquarters building, it is trying to sell its investment in the Boston Red Sox and it recently borrowed $250 million from the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helu, an investor in the company.
 The company has a two-class stock structure, with the majority of the supervoting shares held by a trust for Mr. Sulzberger's extended family. For members of the family, the dividend has been a major source of income.
 The trust released a statement saying, ''In light of the economic climate and the challenges facing the media industry, the trustees believe that the board's suspension of the dividend is in the best interests of all shareholders. All of the trustees remain committed to the editorial integrity and independence of The New York Times.''
 Shares closed Thursday at $3.51, down 20 cents.

HEADLINE: Stimulus Law Aids Small Business, But Benefits Are Not Easy to Find

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
THE $787 billion recovery package that President Obama signed into law on Tuesday has a little something for most small-business owners, though some complained that the law's benefits were not easy to figure out.
 ''Who has time to read it?'' said Michael J. Fredrich, president of MCM Composites, a maker of highly engineered composite molding parts in Manitowoc, Wis. 
 Ethan Siegel, chief executive of Orb Audio, a maker of home theater speakers and systems, said his initial impression was that ''there is nothing in here for me as a small-business owner.'' 
 But Mr. Siegel said that as he started to dig deeper, he found a provision that would increase loan guarantees for Small Business Administration lenders. That, he said, would make it easier for Orb, whose main office is in New York, to secure a line of credit. ''With a line of credit we can do a lot more with the same amount of capital,'' he said, ''which is exactly the purpose of the stimulus package.'' 
 Several other items also caught his eye, including one that offers a tax credit for businesses that hire disadvantaged workers like veterans and ''disconnected youth,'' those who are not in school or working. That credit could be a tipping point between hiring and not, he said. ''This is especially true since we build the speakers in the U.S.A., and the people with production skills can fall into these groups.'' 
 Business owners and their tax advisers are finding that a little detective work is needed to reap the full benefits of the law, which includes tax relief for businesses and individuals, as well as spending provisions. 
 Todd Flemming, chief executive of the Advantor Systems Corporation, a military contractor, for example, said he found spending allocated to military construction. His company, based in Orlando, Fla., makes and installs high-security systems at military installations worldwide. ''That's spending that would be stimulative for us,'' he said. 
 Not everyone will be served directly, said Leonard Steinberg, who owns Steinberg Enterprises, a tax, financial and business advisory company in West Windsor, N.J. His clients, including mom and pop retailers, limited liability companies and S corporations -- corporations that elect to have their income pass through to the shareholders -- ''won't see the benefits of the stimulus,'' he said.
 Even so, tax specialists say, those companies may be aided indirectly by the tax relief for individuals, which will give workers more money to spend and will help certain taxpayers avoid the alternative minimum tax.
 At the same time, some of the tax provisions for businesses, while they mean well, may not help in the way intended, said Barbara Weltman, a tax specialist and author of ''J. K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes 2009.''
 She cited one provision that allows businesses to deduct up to $250,000 for capital investments. ''That sounds great,'' Ms. Weltman said, ''but you can't benefit from it unless you are profitable.'' She added that many businesses were having trouble securing financing, but, if that should free up, the incentive was there.
 Another provision gives companies a 50 percent bonus deduction on capital investments made in 2008 that normally would be deducted over many years. ''Again, that only benefits those who are making capital investments,'' Ms. Weltman said. ''So many people are struggling to pay bills that they cannot go out and make purchases.''
 One tax measure she likes is the ability of companies to use losses from 2008 to offset profits in earlier years -- any full year that is more than two but less than six years ago -- and obtain an immediate refund. It is only for 2008, she pointed out, and for companies with annual revenue of up to $15 million. 
 Mr. Fredrich said he had looked for a silver lining in the law but had yet to find one. ''We certainly will have a loss to carry back, but we could do that before the bill passed,'' he said. ''It does not even move the needle. If you have no revenue, nothing else matters.'' 
 He said he had hoped in vain for a reduction in the highest personal tax rate, a change that would have allowed him to put the money back into his business. 
 Now that the bill has been signed, he said he had not had time to read all 1,000 pages, but he was not optimistic about finding help for his company, which had its last production day of the month on Wednesday.
 Weekly orders at MCM used to generate $100,000 to $180,000, Mr. Fredrich said. Last week, the company took in $32,000, and this week $19,000. ''We expect it to be worse,'' he said. ''You just have to gut it out.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 21, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The Practically Speaking column on Friday, about benefits for small businesses in the federal stimulus package, described incorrectly a provision that gives companies a 50 percent bonus deduction on capital investments. That provision was extended to investments made in 2009; it is not just for investments made in 2008. The article also misstated the production schedule of MCM Composites, whose president commented on the legislation. Wednesday was its last production day of the week, not the month.

HEADLINE: Netanyahu Gains in Bid to Be Israeli Premier

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
Benjamin Netanyahu looked poised to become Israel's next prime minister after earning the endorsement on Thursday of Avigdor Lieberman, head of the far-right party Yisrael Beiteinu. 
 President Shimon Peres has yet to decide who should form Israel's next government. After conferring with Mr. Peres, Mr. Lieberman expressed support for a government led by Mr. Netanyahu's conservative Likud Party but also urged that the government include Kadima, the centrist party led by Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni.
 Mr. Lieberman did not rule out participating in a narrow right-wing government, however, and that looked like a real possibility because Mr. Netanyahu had enough seats to set up such a coalition.
 Mr. Lieberman said there were ''three possibilities, from our point of view: A broad government, which is what we want; a narrow government, that will be a government of paralysis, but we don't rule out sitting in it; and the third option is going to elections, which will achieve nothing.''
 Ms. Livni, however, seemed uninterested in joining any government that she did not head, and told supporters on Thursday that Kadima would probably go into the opposition.
 ''Today, the foundation was laid for an extreme right-wing government led by Netanyahu,'' she told party members. ''This is not our way, and there is nothing for us in such a government.'' 
 She added that she ''would not serve as a fig leaf for a government of paralysis.''
 Kadima favors continuing the peace talks with the Palestinian Authority that Ms. Livni has been leading, while Mr. Netanyahu believes that the talks have been largely fruitless and that emphasis should be placed on building the Palestinians' institutions and economy. 
 Mr. Lieberman's anti-Arab stands, including a demand that all Arab citizens sign a loyalty oath to the Jewish state, have alienated many in Ms. Livni's party. It is widely felt that a government with Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Lieberman in charge would be narrowly based and unstable and would find little favor in Washington, leading to another election before long. 
 Israel's elections last week ended with Kadima edging past Likud to the top spot with 28 seats, compared with 27 for Likud and 15 for Mr. Lieberman's party out of 120 seats in Parliament. A stable government needs a commitment of at least 61 seats. Mr. Netanyahu had 65 by day's end from Mr. Lieberman's party, the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic party Shas, with 11 seats, and several smaller religious parties.
 Mr. Peres has consulted with all parties but was to meet again on Friday first with Mr. Netanyahu and then with Ms. Livni. All three want to see a broad, centrist coalition for the difficult decisions ahead -- what to do about Gaza, the West Bank, Iran and the economy -- but they cannot agree on what terms that coalition would come into being.
 Mr. Peres is expected to announce his choice to form the coalition by Sunday or Monday. Since the parties to the left of Ms. Livni did not endorse her selection, she is in a weak position to get the nod.

HEADLINE: Alston Is Dealt, but Most N.B.A. Deadline Moves Are Minor

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK; Jonathan Abrams and David Waldstein contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Shaquille O'Neal, Amar'e Stoudemire, Vince Carter, Chris Bosh, Marcus Camby, Baron Davis and Richard Jefferson all stayed with their teams on Thursday, when a furious whirlwind of trade rumors gave way to a harmless winter breeze.
 Only one impact player, Rafer Alston, changed teams -- Houston to Orlando -- in the final hours before the N.B.A.'s trade deadline. Alston will become the Magic's starting point guard for the stretch run, replacing the injured Jameer Nelson, who had season-ending shoulder surgery on Thursday. 
Several minor deals were also completed before the 3 p.m. deadline, but a depressed economy and the league's arcane salary-cap rules kept the biggest names from changing teams.
 The most fascinating scenario of the day had O'Neal joining LeBron James in Cleveland. But the Suns, who were seeking cap relief, were not enticed by the Cavaliers' offer of Ben Wallace and Sasha Pavlovic, according to reports by The Cleveland Plain Dealer, Yahoo Sports and other news media outlets.
 Stoudemire had been linked to a half-dozen teams over the last two weeks, but the Suns decided to keep him after replacing Coach Terry Porter with Alvin Gentry and returning to their up-tempo system.
 Carter was likewise dangled around the league, drawing interest from Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, among others. The Nets would have liked to shed Carter's huge contract as they clear cap space for 2010, but they never found the right deal.
 ''The point of the trade deadline is not to just make a deal; it's to make a good deal,'' Nets General Manager Kiki Vandeweghe said. ''In our estimation, there were no deals that were going to benefit our team.''
 The most active teams in the final 24 hours of trading were the Knicks, the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Chicago Bulls, who all made multiple trades.
 The Knicks acquired guard Larry Hughes from the Bulls for three minor players, and also acquired forward Chris Wilcox from Oklahoma City in exchange for Malik Rose and cash. The Thunder acquired Thabo Sefolosha from the Bulls in exchange for a first-round draft pick. A day earlier, the Bulls acquired center Brad Miller and guard John Salmons from Sacramento, in exchange for forwards Andres Nocioni and Drew Gooden.
 By acquiring Hughes and Wilcox, the Knicks sent a clear signal that, although they have embarked on a rebuilding effort, they intend to make the playoffs this season. They began the day three games out of the playoff field, despite a 22-31 record.
 Three months ago, the Knicks traded Jamal Crawford and Zach Randolph -- arguably their two best players -- as part of a payroll purge. Team officials are clearing cap space for the free-agent class of 2010, which could include James, Dwyane Wade, Stoudemire and Bosh.
 ''We want to be competitive, but we don't want to interfere with being in the free-agent market the summer after next,'' said Donnie Walsh, the Knicks' president. ''I hope this will make us more competitive; I feel like it can.''
 Hughes should step right into the Knicks' rotation, possibly as a starter. The Knicks have been without a steady shooting guard since they traded Crawford in November. Wilcox, a solid rebounder and low-post scorer, fills a need in the frontcourt, where the Knicks are thin because of injuries to Eddy Curry and Jerome James, and the trade of Randolph.
 In exchange for Hughes, the Bulls received James, Tim Thomas and Anthony Roberson. Only Thomas had been in the Knicks' rotation. James had season-ending surgery last month to repair a ruptured Achilles' tendon.
 It is the second time the Bulls have acquired Thomas from the Knicks, and it ended badly the last time. After being acquired in a 2005 trade for Curry, Thomas was effectively banished by the Bulls because of his perceived poor practice habits. They waived him a few months later.
 ''I played with Tim for a couple years and had him in Phoenix,'' Bulls Coach Vinny Del Negro told Chicago reporters. ''I didn't have any problem with him. I enjoyed playing with him.'' 
 Wilcox ended up with the Knicks only after a bigger deal fell through this week. Oklahoma City had agreed to send Wilcox and Joe Smith to New Orleans for center Tyson Chandler, but the deal was rescinded after Chandler failed his physical examination.
 The biggest trade of the day, by default, was the three-team deal that sent Alston from Houston to Orlando. The Rockets acquired Brian Cook from the Magic and Kyle Lowry from the Memphis Grizzlies, who obtained a first-round pick, center Adonal Foyle and guard Mike Wilks from the Magic.
 Orlando (39-14) began the day with the third-best record in the Eastern Conference. But the Magic had lost three of its last five games after losing Nelson. Alston could revive Orlando's postseason hopes.
 Two minor deals were also executed just before the trade deadline. Sacramento acquired guard Rashad McCants and center Calvin Booth from Minnesota, in exchange for forward Shelden Williams and guard Bobby Brown. The Grizzlies acquired center Chris Mihm from the Lakers, in exchange for a conditional second-round pick in 2013.

HEADLINE: Health Care Industry In Talks to Shape Policy

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Since last fall, many of the leading figures in the nation's long-running health care debate have been meeting secretly in a Senate hearing room. Now, with the blessing of the Senate's leading proponent of universal health insurance, Edward M. Kennedy, they appear to be inching toward a consensus that could reshape the debate.
 Many of the parties, from big insurance companies to lobbyists for consumers, doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies, are embracing the idea that comprehensive health care legislation should include a requirement that every American carry insurance.
 While not all industry groups are in complete agreement, there is enough of a consensus, according to people who have attended the meetings, that they have begun to tackle the next steps: how to enforce the requirement for everyone to have health insurance; how to make insurance affordable to the uninsured; and whether to require employers to help buy coverage for their employees. 
 The talks, which are taking place behind closed doors, are unusual. Lobbyists for a wide range of interest groups -- some of which were involved in defeating national health legislation in 1993-4 -- are meeting with the staff of Mr. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, in a search for common ground.
 Mr. Kennedy is fighting brain cancer, and participants in the talks said his illness had added urgency to the discussions.
 While President Obama is not directly represented in the talks, the White House has been kept informed and is encouraging the Senate effort as a way to get the ball rolling on health legislation.
 Kennedy aides summarized discussions of the stakeholders, known as the ''workhorse group,'' in a recent memorandum obtained by The New York Times. 
 ''While there was some diversity of views,'' it said, ''the sense of the room is that an individual obligation to purchase insurance should be part of reform if that obligation is coupled with effective mechanisms to make coverage meaningful and affordable.''
 The ideas discussed include a proposal to penalize people who fail to comply with the ''individual obligation'' to have insurance.
 ''There seems to be a sense of the room that some form of tax penalty is an effective means to enforce such an obligation, though only on those for whom affordable coverage is available,'' said the memorandum, prepared by David C. Bowen, a neurobiologist who is director of the health staff at the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. 
 The proposal for an individual mandate was one of the few policy disagreements between Mr. Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton in their fight for the Democratic presidential nomination. She wanted to require everyone to have and maintain insurance. He said he wanted to ''ensure affordable coverage for all,'' but would initially apply the mandate only to children.
 The 20 people who regularly attend the meetings on Capitol Hill include lobbyists for AARP, Aetna, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the American Cancer Society, the American Medical Association, America's Health Insurance Plans, the Business Roundtable, Easter Seals, the National Federation of Independent Business, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, and the United States Chamber of Commerce.
 Their motives vary. Some say the moment to overhaul the health care system has arrived because of a confluence of events, including Mr. Obama's election, the growing number of uninsured and the relentless increase in health costs. Some want to protect the interests of their members and could ultimately oppose the legislation, depending on its details. 
 While a fragile consensus is slowly emerging, it is not unanimous. The Business Roundtable, representing big corporations, would place ''an obligation on all Americans to have health insurance coverage'' and says the government should offer financial aid to help low-income people buy it.
 On the other hand, James P. Gelfand, senior manager of health policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said: ''Forcing individuals to purchase insurance in the current market would be a disaster. Before we even have that discussion, we need to make health care more affordable and improve its quality.''
 The current efforts contrast with the Clinton administration's approach in 1993-4. The Clinton White House demonized health insurance companies, accusing them of ''price gouging'' and profiteering. Mr. Kennedy is trying to keep insurers and other stakeholders talking together in the same room. Getting affordable health insurance is now a top priority for small-business owners, who helped kill the Clinton plan.
 Participants in the talks, held around tables arranged in a big square, said they had not agreed on whether employers should be required to contribute to the cost of coverage for their employees. Nor have they agreed whether it is desirable to change the tax treatment of employer-sponsored insurance, which is not counted in an employee's taxable income.
 Having just passed a $787 billion measure to pull the nation out of its economic rut, Democrats are eager to work with Mr. Obama to realize their long-deferred dream of universal coverage.
 Employers and insurers tend to agree with Republicans more often than Democrats on health policy, and business lobbyists have implored Republicans to participate in the talks.
 But so far Republican aides have stayed away from the sessions, saying they felt they would be relegated to a secondary role, with no opportunity to set the agenda or choose the outside participants.
 A business lobbyist involved in the talks said: ''The lack of acrimony, the air of cooperation toward a common end, is quite refreshing. If the Republicans were a party to these intense discussions, that would ease the path to enacting health care reform.''
 This lobbyist, like most other participants, spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying that Senate aides had threatened to expel anyone who divulged details of the work group.
 Over the years, Mr. Kennedy has used such stakeholder meetings to forge consensus on many legislative issues, including health care, civil rights and immigration. 
 It is not clear whether such back-room negotiations are still viable at a time when politicians are promising a new transparency and condemning the influence of lobbyists.
 Many businesses, crushed by soaring health costs, say they now support changes in the health care system as a way to control their costs. But in its summary of the recent discussions, Mr. Kennedy's office said, ''There was little consensus on the employers' role.''
 Many insurance executives say they are willing to accept stricter regulation, including a requirement to offer coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions, if the federal government requires everyone to have coverage.
 The lobbyists have discussed two ways to make insurance available to all, by offering subsidies for private insurance, based on a person's income, and by expanding public programs.
 Members of the group generally agree that ''eligibility levels for Medicaid should be increased,'' the memorandum says, so that more people would qualify. Lobbyists said that if the government subsidized insurance premiums, it would probably need to set minimum standards for benefits as well.
 Some participants in the talks said Congress should specify the benefits. But ''the sense of the room seemed to be'' that Congress should leave details to a group of experts, according to the memorandum. 
 Under this proposal, the experts would define the minimum coverage ''within statutory parameters'' set by Congress. Insurersmight be allowed to offer different benefits with the same overall value. 
 The group has also been discussing the possibility that federal standards ''may supersede state benefit mandates.''

HEADLINE: Salvaging Afghanistan

 BODY:
President Obama and his aides haven't completed their policy review for Afghanistan -- one of the most dangerous of the many foreign policy disasters George W. Bush so blithely left behind. But the situation is unraveling so quickly that aides say that the president decided that he had no choice but to send another 17,000 troops while commanders and diplomats try to come up with a strategy to stop the bloodletting and to try to block the Taliban from recapturing the country. There isn't a lot of time. 
 In coming weeks, Mr. Obama will have to grapple with a series of very difficult questions starting with how he will define success in Afghanistan. The president will have to consider whether to keep supporting a central government in Kabul or focus more on cultivating local leaders. The rampant corruption of President Hamid Karzai's government has driven far too many Afghans back to the extremists.
 During the campaign, Mr. Obama said that he was open to talks with some Afghan militants. In recent weeks, American commanders said they are expanding contacts with so-called moderate members of the Taliban. At this point, there may be no other choice. 
 But we are deeply skeptical that there is any deal to be cut with Taliban leaders who gave sanctuary to Al Qaeda before 9/11 and would undoubtedly insist on reimposing their repressive, medieval ways, including denying education and medical care to women.
 Mr. Obama and his team also must quickly come up with a plan to more effectively expand and train the Afghan Army (which eventually must replace American and NATO troops) and police force, curb a $720 million Afghan opium industry that finances the Taliban and encourage development along the Afghan-Pakistan border. 
 Mr. Obama will have to figure out a way to persuade NATO allies to send more troops -- with orders to fight -- and more money. Along with the United States, Britain, Canada and the Netherlands have been carrying nearly all of the burden. The new American president has rock star ratings in Europe. He needs to leverage some of that to get leaders there to finally ante up. 
 Mr. Obama's biggest challenge will be trying to figure out how to persuade Pakistan that the fight against extremism is not a favor to the Americans. It is essential to Pakistan's own survival.
 The nuclear-armed country faces terrifying problems: political and economic instability, home-grown extremists who are far too cozy with Pakistan's intelligence services, a lawless border region used by the Taliban to execute bloody attacks on Afghanistan. This week the government effectively ceded the Swat Valley -- which is in the border region but just 100 miles from Islamabad -- to militants in a misguided bid for a false peace. 
 The White House's decision to bring senior Pakistani and Afghan officials into the policy discussion -- they visit Washington next week -- is very welcome. Saudi Arabia, Iran and India must also be involved.
 Mr. Obama goes to Europe the first week of April for a NATO summit. He has told aides to come up with a strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan before then. Given how fast things are coming apart in Afghanistan -- the Taliban have now moved into peaceful areas near Kabul -- they may have to decide even faster.

HEADLINE: Cellphones Without Strings

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Maybe Tony Soprano was onto something. As the lead mobster in the HBO series ''The Sopranos,'' he and his crew often turned to prepaid cellphones, presumably to avoid wiretaps.
But now these pay-as-you-go phones are winning over fans for different reasons -- recession-battered consumers are buying them as a way to cut costs and avoid the lengthy contracts and occasional billing surprises that come with traditional cellphone plans.
''Frugal is the new chic,'' said Joy Miller, 33, a piano teacher in Aubrey, Tex. After almost a decade on contract plans with Verizon Wireless, Mrs. Miller and her husband decided this month to test-drive a few prepaid plans, including MetroPCS. ''In today's economy, it's not cool to pay $120 a month for a phone. It's a waste of money.'' 
Although prepaid phones remain a fraction of the overall mobile phone market, sales of the category grew 13 percent in North America last year, nearly three times faster than traditional cellphone plans, according to Pali Research, an investment advisory firm. For the first time in its history, T-Mobile has been signing up more new prepaid customers than traditional ones. And Sprint Nextel is betting that a new flat-rate prepaid plan will help it wring more value from its struggling Nextel unit.
Any stigma attached to the phones -- they are a common prop in any show or movie about gangs and spies -- is falling away as prices drop and the quality of the phones rises. Prepaid carriers like MetroPCS, Virgin Mobile and Sprint's Boost Mobile division now offer sleeker handsets, better coverage and more options, from 10-cent-a-minute calling cards that customers refill as needed to $50-a-month, flat-rate plans for chatterboxes who want unlimited calling, Web browsing and text messaging.
The savings can be considerable. An AT&T customer with an Apple iPhone on a traditional plan pays at least $130 a month, excluding taxes and fees, for unlimited calls and Web use. Compared with the $50-a-month, all-inclusive prepaid plans, the iPhone owner pays nearly $1,000 more over the course of a year.
Prepaid customers typically have to buy their phones without the subsidies offered with a contract. When Jerry Cruz, a manager at a tanning salon in Manhattan, switched to T-Mobile's prepaid service, he paid more than $300 apiece for Sidekicks, which feature keyboards and cameras, for himself and his daughter. But, he said, he saves at least $40 a month compared with his previous contract with Sprint. ''Every dollar I save goes towards something else.''
MetroPCS, a carrier based in Dallas that sells only prepaid plans and just added New York and Boston to its network, said it has seen a lot of interest from people who are ''cutting the cord,'' or abandoning their landlines to use only a mobile phone.
''Over 80 percent of our users use our phone as their primary phone,'' said Tom Keys, the company's chief operating officer. MetroPCS added 520,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter, the biggest quarterly gain in its six-year history. MetroPCS finished 2008 with more than five million subscribers, a 35 percent increase over 2007.
Charlie Bournis, owner of Champion Wireless in Brooklyn, said his prepaid business doubled in the last year while sales of traditional contract plans plunged.
''In 2001, we would sell upwards of 100 contracts per month,'' he said. ''Now, maybe we do 10.'' The store sells 100 prepaid refill cards each week, he said.
Boost Mobile's $50 unlimited-everything prepaid plan, introduced last month, has helped stoke demand, said Mr. Bournis.
''Over the holidays, all of our Boost Mobile handsets were just collecting dirt,'' he added. ''After they announced the $50 plan, they sold out within a week. It doesn't make any sense to get a contract anymore.''
Prepaid plans are generally offered in two flavors. Customers can buy pay-as-you-go cards, with $20 providing 60 to 200 minutes of calling time that must be used within a specified period. Some prepaid companies also offer flat-rate monthly plans that resemble traditional plans except that customers pay upfront and have no continuing commitment. Customers can even switch back and forth between the types of prepaid plans depending on their needs.
Wireless carriers are ambivalent about the growing popularity of prepaid services. They would prefer to sign up customers with good credit to long-term contracts. But as the overall mobile phone market becomes more saturated, they are looking for growth wherever they can.
Sprint and T-Mobile, the No. 3 and No. 4 carriers in the country, are particularly aggressive about courting prepaid customers. In the fourth quarter, 355,000 of the 621,000 customers that T-Mobile added were prepaid users.
Prepaid phones are not for everyone, said Peter Pham, chief executive of BillShrink, which offers free analysis of consumers' cellphone bills and recommends cheaper plans that match their calling patterns. Some carriers, like MetroPCS or Leap Wireless International's Cricket, have limited networks or charge extra for roaming outside regional zones.
The trick, he said, is for consumers to figure out their calling needs and pick the plan that make sense. ''Saving $15 to $20 a month is a big deal these days,'' Mr. Pham said.

CHART: Regular or Prepaid
Cellphone Plans Compared: Depending on a customer's pattern of usage, prepaid cellphone plans can save hundreds of dollars a year over traditional contract plans, which are paid at the end of the month. With flat-rate prepaid plans, customers pay up front for a month of unlimited texting, e-mailing and Web surfing. Pay-as-you-go plans, which are better suited to occasional callers, allow customers to buy refill cards that provide a certain number of minutes of talk time. Here is a comparison of some leading plans.

HEADLINE: Back in America After 70 Years: A Storied Polo Rivalry

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

 BODY:
WELLINGTON, Fla. -- Thrust into the role of gentleman gaucho, the legendary British polo player Julian Hipwood was rounding up ponies from as far as his cellphone roams.
Two days before the 2009 Westchester Cup, a storied polo competition between the United States and Britain dating to 1886, Hipwood managed to marshal three dozen horses to a field that ends where the Everglades begin.
For the four-man team from Britain, the practices leading to Saturday's match have been the equestrian equivalent of speed dating, featuring a multitude of mounts. During a practice game Thursday against the White Birch Club's United States Open entry, the Britons changed ponies after every chukker in the hopes of finding a few suitable matches. One of the players, James Beim, test-rode nine. 
Two weeks ago, Hipwood said, the quality of mounts he was being offered by the host Americans led him to believe the Britons would be at a distinct disadvantage. With a few exceptions, he said, the Americans have not made their best ones available. ''The Americans are very pro-American,'' Hipwood said. ''They're kind of looking after their own.''
Because of the distressed economy, there are fewer teams here than normal preparing for the coming United States Open, further shrinking the pool of prospects. The horses Hipwood rounded up Thursday, though, gave him hope. ''We're better mounted now,'' he said. ''There won't be a huge gap like I thought two weeks ago.''
To appreciate the Britons' predicament, imagine the Ryder Cup being played in the United States with the golfers from Europe using borrowed clubs. Or the celebrity finalists on ''Dancing With the Stars'' changing partners before their final tangos.
Player and pony are joined at the haunches, their partnership forged on communication as subtle as a flicked wrist or pricked ears. During a match, the ponies are continually counterbalancing their riders who lean out, back or over them while swinging mallets. It is an intricate dance that requires many hours of daily exercise and training to sharpen their techniques as a twosome.
The British players and their borrowed ponies are trying to develop that rapport overnight. It is a small price, the Britons say, to pay for the privilege of playing in the first Westchester Cup on United States soil in 70 years.
''Horses in the sport are everything, so the American team has a bit of an advantage,'' the British coach, Javier Novillo Astrada, said. ''But we are happy to be here because I think this is a good thing to publicize the sport. That's the idea, you know. To start building it slowly.''
The Britons are here to revive a rivalry that in the years after World War I was one of the most celebrated in sports. The first Westchester Cup, which was contested at the Westchester Polo Club in Newport, R.I., in 1886, was won by the British.
This year's event is being played to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Americans' first victory. They were also victorious the last time it was held in the United States, at the Meadow Brook Club in Westbury, N.Y. For that event, the British were so determined to win for the first time since 1914 that they shipped their 64 ponies to the United States six months before the matches in June 1939 to give them time to become acclimated.
A crowd of many thousands watched the United States team, led by Tommy Hitchcock Jr., dispatch the Britons with ease. The Cup has been held twice since then, most recently in 1997, when Britain finally ended its losing streak.
Retaining the Cup will not be easy for the Britons, but they improved their chances when they reached out to Eduardo Novillo Astrada, who was born in London but lives in Argentina and is a brother of the coach, Javier.
Eduardo Novillo Astrada, 36, plays the No. 3 position, the polo equivalent of point guard. He is a top-notch tactician, and his long passes leave his mallet head like arrows from a bow. Luke Tomlinson, the British captain, said the team would have no chance of winning without him. ''It's as simple as that,'' he said.
And yet his inclusion was not as automatic as a throw-in. There are those in Britain who hold a grudge against the Argentines for supplanting the British as the kings of the sport. Some attribute the British decline to the predilection of the well-heeled patrons of the top clubs to pass up homegrown talent to sign Argentine players.
With a wink and a nod to the controversy, Tomlinson, when called upon to introduce his teammates at a cocktail party at the Museum of Polo and Hall of Fame, called Astrada ''Edward.''
''It was a big step to invite me,'' said Eduardo, who shrugged off the controversy. ''It's difficult for them to accept that maybe I'm English because I play in Argentina.''
Eduardo will bring more to Saturday's match, hosted by the International Polo Club Palm Beach, than just his leadership and expertise. He has ponies stabled in Florida, so he will be the lone Briton riding mounts he knows like the calluses on his hands, including his favorite, Flecha (which means ''arrow'' in Spanish).
The objective for each team Saturday in the six-chukker championship game, aside from winning, is to grow the sport of polo. ''We're doing this for the future,'' Beim said. The participants will know they succeeded if the Westchester Cup becomes an alternate-year event, like the Ryder Cup, and no one has to scramble for horses.

HEADLINE: San Francisco Identifies Buildings Most at Risk

BYLINE: By MALIA WOLLAN

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- The picturesque Victorians and brightly painted apartment buildings where thousands of city residents live and work are especially vulnerable during earthquakes, according to a report issued Friday by the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection.
The report said that an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 or higher could render unlivable as many as 85 percent of the city's ''soft-story'' apartment buildings -- those that are less structurally sound because their ground floors are open space, often used as retail stores or garages. At least 65,000 people live and work in the 2,800 most vulnerable buildings studied in the report.
The cost to retrofit those wood-framed buildings would be about $260 million. The expense would be borne by the landlords and the city, which is facing a $576 million budget shortfall. 
''A big earthquake is overdue in the region, and we're not naive to that reality,'' said Mayor Gavin Newsom, who ordered the report in July and is working on legislation to make earthquake safety upgrades mandatory on soft-story buildings. ''We cannot wait five years. We should have done this 35 years ago, 100 years ago.''
Mr. Newsom said that he recognized the economic realities facing the city and its 744,000 residents and that he did not want retrofitting to put building owners ''at risk of insolvency.''
Still, building owners say they are nervous about the cost of earthquake damages and the cost of mandatory changes. Few apartment owners in the city carry earthquake insurance, the report said.
''We want to keep our tenants safe, but we're fearful in this economy,'' said Janan New, director of the San Francisco Apartment Association, a rental property owners association. ''No one is going to get financing for construction in this market.''
There is a 20 percent chance of a magnitude 7.2 earthquake on the San Andreas Fault just west of the city sometime in the next 30 years, according to the United States Geological Survey. That probability jumps to 63 percent for a magnitude 6.7 tremor. And seismologists say many of the fault lines running veinlike across the state could begin shaking anytime.
Predictions about earthquakes and the potential wreckage wrought are not taken lightly in San Francisco, where a quake in 1906 left much of the city in ruins and started a fire that lasted three days, killing more than a thousand people. A 1989 earthquake, which had a magnitude 6.9 on the Richter scale, resulted in dozens of deaths and billions of dollars in damage.
Some neighborhoods, particularly those along the water, were once wetlands and sand dunes that had to be fortified. Particularly precarious are the soft-story building atop the artificial fill because, ''the ground becomes liquid and buildings lose their ability to stand and then they begin sinking into the ground,'' said Thomas Brocher, a chief scientist for the Geological Survey's Western Earthquake Hazards Team.
Building department employees walked block by block through the city, tallying the number of multiunit, soft-story buildings constructed before 1973, when changes to the city's building codes mandated more structurally sound buildings. The count was 4,400. The study released Friday by the building department's Community Action Plan for Seismic Safety considers only the most dangerous of those.
The price tag to fortify the city against the grinding fault lines flanking it on all sides is likely to climb as the building department continues to study other at-risk structures over the next 18 months.
''This report shows the potential for soft-story buildings to collapse,'' said Vivian Day, director of the building department. ''But in earthquake country, almost any kind of building can collapse. It just depends on the size of the earthquake.''

HEADLINE: Foreign Investors Wary of Long-Term U.S. Securities

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
JUST when the United States really, really needs the money, overseas investors seem to be less willing to buy long-term American securities.
The government said this week that net purchases of those securities fell to $412.5 billion in 2008, less than half the 2007 level and the lowest annual total since 1999, when the federal government was running a budget surplus. 
Money did come in, but it was diverted into the safest investment around, albeit one with almost no expectation of profit, Treasury bills. Overseas investors increased their holdings of those securities by $456 billion, an unprecedented flow.
A good part of that cash may have come from investors who would otherwise have invested in bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage lending enterprises.
For many years, those securities, which carried an implicit -- that is, not certain -- government guarantee, were popular overseas because they yielded more than Treasury bonds but seemed to have little additional risk.
But foreigners began selling them as the financial crisis accelerated last summer, and continued doing so even after the government rescued Fannie and Freddie and issued an explicit guarantee of their debts. Over all, foreigners sold $37.8 billion of agency securities. It was the first year since 1983, when the agency market was much smaller, that foreigners were net sellers.
The aversion to risk also showed up in the choice of long-term securities that were purchased. Foreigners bought a net $316 billion in Treasury notes and bonds, the most in three years. But purchases of corporate bonds and stocks plunged.
It has long been a cliche that foreign investors in any market lack local knowledge and get the timing wrong. The data bears that out this year. The largest annual flow into American stocks ever was in 2007, when $195.5 billion came in. That broke the previous record of $174.9 billion, set in 2000. Stock prices fell sharply after each of those years.
The decline in funds for corporate bonds was not entirely attributable to a new hesitation to lend money to companies. The government counted other securities -- like private mortgage-backed securities -- as corporate bonds, and those markets have basically dried up. In any case, foreign purchases of corporate bonds fell to under $100 billion in 2008, less than a fifth of the level two years before.
Official institutions -- foreign governments and central banks -- have largely stopped investing in long-term American securities, a fact that may reflect their need for funds at home as the global recession deepens. Those institutions were net sellers in every month from July through December, an unprecedented stretch.
The fact that so much of the money came into Treasury bills -- which mature within a year -- means that the owners can get their money back whenever they wish, and will get it soon if they simply do nothing. It is thus readily available to move rapidly.
When the fear that drove money into Treasury bills fades, it may become clearer whether the rest of the world still sees the United States as a good place for long-term investments.

HEADLINE: Fraud Case Shakes a Billionaire's Caribbean Realm

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, JULIE CRESWELL and CHARLIE SAVAGE; Clifford Krauss reported from St. John's, Julie Creswell from New York and Charlie Savage from Washington. Simon Romero contributed from Caracas, Venezuela.

 BODY:
This article was reported byClifford Krauss, Julie Creswelland Charlie Savage.
ST. JOHN'S, Antigua -- When Robert Allen Stanford arrived here in the early 1990s, few locals had ever heard of the Texas financier. Today, he dominates so many aspects of life on this sun-drenched Caribbean island that some have taken to calling it ''Stanford Land.''
At one point or another, he has owned an airline that many locals and visitors fly on. A local newspaper that covers their goings-on. A vast residential complex where many live. Two restaurants where they eat. And a stadium where they go to watch cricket, the island's favorite sport.
But the crown jewel of his domain has long been Stanford International Bank, an offshore institution that attracted billions of dollars of cash from clients around the world -- and especially from Latin America -- seeking a haven for their wealth. 
All the while, he cultivated a comfortable relationship with Antiguan officials. The bank made loans to the Antiguan government, which often used the money to award his companies lucrative construction contracts. To clean up the nation's image as a dodgy tax haven, the authorities installed him on a new regulatory authority to oversee its banks -- including his own.
To some, it felt too cozy.
''There seemed to be a complete breakdown of the normal barriers between the regulator and the regulated,'' said Jonathan Winer, who was, at the time, a deputy assistant secretary of state for the United States State Department. ''The relationship between the government of Antigua's political leaders and Stanford seemed weirdly intimate.''
Despite raised eyebrows and occasional investigations of Mr. Stanford -- or Sir Allen, as he is called here since he was knighted by the Antiguan government in 2006 -- his sway continued to grow. That is, until this week, when the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Stanford International of orchestrating a huge fraud that may have bilked investors of some $8 billion that regulators say cannot be accounted for. The company is referring all calls to the S.E.C.
Mr. Stanford, 58, who has not been charged with any criminal wrongdoing, could not be reached. On Friday, his troubles mounted, as officials here took over his Antiguan bank, following seizures of his operations elsewhere in the world.
Stanford International claims it had about $8 billion in assets, but the Securities and Exchange Commission has only said it has not been able to account for that money. Most of the key players, including Mr. Stanford, failed to appear to testify after the S.E.C. issued a subpeona.
Seeking Answers
The collapse of Mr. Stanford's empire has left many questions unresolved. What happened to investors' money, which supposedly was put into high-quality assets? To what extent did his efforts to curry favors with politicians here -- and in the United States, where he made contributions to many congressmen -- help him elude serious scrutiny despite suspicions raised about his activities in the past? And what was the nature of the fraud that is being alleged -- a plain-vanilla securities fraud, as the S.E.C. has charged; a Ponzi scheme; or, given the history of some offshore Caribbean banks, was money laundering also involved?
It may take months to figure out the answers. Few documents have emerged to shed light on Mr. Stanford's business dealings, which involved high-yielding certificates of deposits sold to investors and housed in the Antigua bank -- or even its exact size.
In numerous interviews with former Stanford employees, former American regulators and agency officials, and individuals who had direct dealings with Mr. Stanford over the years, a picture emerges of a man who had visions of grandeur for himself and his company and who knew the key to his success was aligning himself with politically powerful individuals.
At the same time, much of Mr. Stanford's true background appears elusive.
Born in Mexia, Tex., a rural town of 6,600 about 85 miles southeast of Dallas, he claims to have based his company, Stanford Financial Group, on an insurance firm started by his grandfather Lodis Stanford during the Depression.
Mr. Stanford's first foray into business, however, was far from finance. He started with a chain of body-building gyms in Waco, Tex. He later claimed to make much of his fortune in the 1980s buying distressed properties in Houston.
A former Stanford employee said that while some properties, such as ones Mr. Stanford picked up in the chic River Oaks area of Houston, made money, many others ended up as busts.
So when Mr. Stanford decided to start his first offshore bank, Guardian International Bank, on the Caribbean island of Montserrat in 1986, he turned to his father, James Stanford, for about $2 million to $4 million in seed money, according to the employee, who declined to be named because he did not want to be drawn into ongoing investigations.
Guardian International sought out wealthy individuals and companies in Mexico, Venezuela and Central America, where people were eager to move money offshore because of onerous regulatory and political regimes.
Antigua-Bound
As Mr. Stanford's small operation grew, so did his ambitions.
''He talked about wanting to build the largest financial company in the world,'' the employee said.
Mr. Stanford, who showed at times a charming demeanor as well as a fiery temper (a former employee said he once threw a glass ash tray against the wall in a fit of anger), began to see himself in more grandiose ways. He came up with a shiny new logo for his company, a Golden Eagle, which he described as a knight's shield and required all employees to wear.
In the early 1990s, the government of Montserrat cracked down on a number of offshore banks. Guardian was out.
Quickly, Mr. Stanford set his sights on territory he would soon call home, Antigua. His presence on the tiny island, population 85,000, began taking shape when Lester Bird, then the prime minister, saw him as a can-do American with ample cash who could help solve Antigua's myriad problems. When the local, Bank of Antigua ran into difficulties, for example, Mr. Stanford stepped in in 1990 to take it over.
And when the United States began pressuring the Bird government in the late 1990s to take a firmer hand on alleged money laundering, Prime Minister Bird again asked Mr. Stanford to help.
The government formed a banking advisory board and put Mr. Stanford on it, a move that alarmed American authorities scrutinizing Antigua, who saw an inherent conflict of interest since the board also oversaw Mr. Stanford's bank. The project was paid for by the Antiguan government by money either lent or granted by Mr. Stanford.
Various United States regulators and agencies were already uneasy about Mr. Stanford. Around 1998, he sent a letter to Jeanette Hyde, then the United States ambassador to Antigua, in which he said he had been investigated by numerous agencies over the years. None of them had turned up anything, he claimed, a vindication he said showed he was a law-abiding citizen.
If anything, the concerns about Antigua and Mr. Stanford's presence there grew. In 1999, he gave the Drug Enforcement Agency a $3.1 million cashier's check from Stanford Financial in Antigua after the bank found that a former Mexican drug lord had hid or laundered money there. The same year, however, the American Treasury Department placed Antigua on its money-laundering watch list.
Around the same time, Mr. Stanford and his Houston-based company, Stanford Financial Group, burst onto the scene as players in federal politics. The White House was pushing legislation to make banks crack down on money laundering, so Stanford Financial hired a Washington lobbying firm and began donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republicans and Democrats alike.
Suspicions Grow
The sudden rush of money drew the attention of Public Citizen, which singled out Stanford as a case study of the influence of campaign donations in shaping legislation. Public Citizen concluded that it was ''clear'' that the Stanford contributions ''were aimed at killing the bills,'' although broader help turned out to be unnecessary because Texas Republicans simply blocked it from receiving a vote in both chambers. (After the 2001 terrorist attacks, Congress revived and passed the money-laundering proposals. Antigua's government, meanwhile, had recreated the reform panel and rewrote its banking regulations to Washington's satisfaction, allowing its name to be stricken from the watch list that same year.)
Still, Mr. Stanford kept his outreach to Washington going. From 1999 to 2008, Stanford Financial dispensed some $4.8 million on lobbying activities -- spending $2.2 million of that in 2008 alone -- and its employees and its political action committee have given $2.4 million to federal candidates since 2000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Mr. Stanford also wooed lawmakers and their staff with plane rides and ''fact-finding'' trips to vacation destinations. Many were paid for by the Inter-American Economic Council, a nonprofit organization that he supported.
In recent days, some lawmakers have sought to distance themselves from Mr. Stanford. Among them is Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, who received more money from Mr. Stanford and his employees than any other lawmaker: $45,900, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Mr. Nelson's office said he was donating the money to charity.
Another lawmaker, Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas, received $41,375 in such donations. He also went on two council trips, totaling more than $10,000 in expenses, according to Legistorm, a group that tracks lawmaker travel disclosure forms.
Mr. Sessions's spokeswoman, Emily Davis, told Bloomberg News this week that Mr. Sessions did not know Mr. Stanford personally. But that account was called into question when the Web site Talking Points Memo published a photograph showing the two men talking during a trip to Antigua. (Ms. Davis declined to comment on Friday.)
But Mr. Stanford's ties to key lawmakers did not completely shield him from the wary eyes of regulators. A routine S.E.C. examination of Stanford's broker-dealer operations in Houston revealed a major problem -- the firm was in violation of net capital requirements, resulting in the company paying a fine of $20,000 in 2007.
In 2006, the agency opened an investigation, but halted it abruptly at the behest of another unnamed agency. The inquiry was reopened late last year, after the alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme involving Bernard L. Madoff came to light. It is unclear why these and other investigations, including by various law enforcement agencies, appeared to have stalled over the years.
Meanwhile, relatively unfettered, Mr. Stanford and his companies continued to attract money to their Antigua-based bank, particularly from Venezuela and other Latin American countries. Venezuelan regulators estimate investors there may have put $2.5 billion into C.D.'s issued by the Antigua-based bank.
Mr. Stanford was quick to offer flights to prospective investors to Antigua on his private jets and maybe a breezy trip through Antigua's quiet bays on his yacht.
The richest prospective investors would be put up for a few days at Jumby Bay, a 300-acre secluded private island with cottage guest rooms and a nature preserve.
''He's an 'everything is big in Texas' kind of man,'' said Winston Derrick, a radio show host and publisher of The Antigua Observer newspaper, the competitor of Mr. Stanford's own newspaper. ''Everything he does is first class.''
Now, Antigua is reeling. Senior government officials declined to comment on their relationships with Mr. Stanford. Many met behind closed doors Friday with executives of several local Stanford companies to gauge how far the Stanford empire would be impacted. ''What we are concerned about is the fallout,'' said Attorney General Justin Simon. ''Although it is only one bank, we need to ensure that the local assets are protected for depositors.''
Correction: February 26, 2009, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the relationship of the financier Robert Allen Stanford to the Caribbean island of Antigua misstated the year when he started his first offshore bank, on Montserrat. It was 1986, not 1996. The article also referred incorrectly to the status of a cricket stadium built by Mr. Stanford. The stadium, on Mr. Stanford's property, is used for short matches sponsored by the Stanford International Bank; it is not the national stadium. (The national cricket stadium is the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium.)
And a picture caption with the article misspelled the Virginia town where Mr. Stanford was served with a civil complaint in an alleged investor fraud. It is Fredericksburg -- not Fredricksburg.

HEADLINE: 6 Governors May Reject Portions Of Stimulus

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
A handful of Republican governors say they may reject portions of the federal stimulus money, raising objections from lawmakers, mayors and other critics that they are placing political ideology before the interest of constituents who need help and budgets with huge deficits.
Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana announced Friday that he would reject a portion of expanded unemployment benefits that would eventually require the state to raise taxes on businesses. 
And the governors of Alaska, Idaho, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas have said their states may not want to meet the conditions that accompany the money or expand programs that will have to be paid for by the state once the stimulus money runs out.
''You may get yourself out of a temporary budget hole, but create another budget hole in the next 24 months,'' said Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, who like Mr. Jindal and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is considered a potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.
Although Mr. Sanford has said he will not stand in the way of his state's accepting the $463 million in transportation money in the bill, his public opposition to the stimulus measure angered Representative James E. Clyburn, a powerful South Carolina Democrat who helped write it. Mr. Clyburn included a provision saying that if a governor did not agree in 45 days to accept the state's allocation in the bill, a legislature could request the money.
Mr. Jindal said he would reject $98.4 million in federal incentives to expand unemployment coverage, or 2.5 percent of the $3.8 billion that Louisiana stands to receive in all, on the grounds that it would force a change to state law to cover more unemployed people. Such a change would result in increased taxes when the federal money runs out, he said.
''I strongly suggest that other states also look closely at this provision in the bill so they can also avoid ultimately passing on a significant tax to businesses,'' he said in a statement.
Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi has also focused on the unemployment provisions, saying that of $54 million offered to his state under the bill, only $4 million would be available unless Mississippi changed its law to expand eligibility to part-time workers. But Mr. Barbour has not yet formally rejected the money.
Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director at the National Employment Law Project in Washington, a group that advocates for low-wage workers, differed with Mr. Barbour's interpretation. Mr. Emsellem said Mississippi, where average unemployment benefits are the lowest in the nation and only 25 percent of unemployed workers qualify for help, would receive $42 million for increased payments to recipients and $4 million for administrative costs without changing its policy.
Under the incentive program that Mr. Jindal turned down for Louisiana, Mississippi would get up to $56 million more for expanding coverage by selecting from a menu of options that includes giving benefits to some part-time workers. The $56 million would pay for the expanded benefits for five years, Mr. Emsellem said.
Some governors objected even to the no-strings-attached $25 a week increase in unemployment benefits, saying it would raise expectations that would be difficult to manage when the federal dollars dry up.
In Idaho, Gov. C. L. Otter has appointed an executive panel of five former state budget officers and three former governors to review requests for stimulus money from state agencies and the private sector. David Hensley, a lawyer for Mr. Otter, complained that the law required the state to spend 3 percent of the transportation money on ''transportation enhancement.''
''I never imagined that Congress would tell the state of Idaho that they have to spend $5.5 million on bike paths or pedestrian lanes,'' Mr. Hensley said.

RESHAPING DIPLOMACY
By Tossing the Script
Hillary Rodham Clinton is redefining the job of secretary of state, fusing the weighty themes of regional security and nuclear proliferation with lighter encounters in which Mrs. Clinton is quizzed about her musical tastes or asked what it was like to raise her daughter.

HEADLINE: When the Sideshow Becomes the Main Event

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
You may not care about the Oscars, but the Oscars definitely don't care about you.
The producers and broadcasters of the Academy Awards ceremony want us all to watch, of course, and they fret about the decline in ratings. There has already been ritualistic worrying about the low box-office returns collected by some of the best picture nominees this year. While ''Slumdog Millionaire'' and ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'' have done pretty well, the combined grosses of the other three would barely reach the bellybutton of ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop.'' Has the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences lost touch -- or broken faith -- with the moviegoing public?
The question makes sense only if you believe that any such faith existed in the first place, or that the moviegoing public is something more than a mathematical abstraction. But hand-wringing about the state of the audience has become such a staple of Oscar-season discourse that its peculiar double-edged logic deserves some unpacking. 
There is a fake-populist version, favored by hard-nosed business columnists and trade paper wiseguys, which condemns the elitism of the academy. All those heavy-duty, deep-dish, politically correct dramas! Don't those academicians understand that the people want ''Friday the 13th'' and ''The Dark Knight,''Harry Potter and Pixar?
The response is simply to turn the accusation on its head, to answer fake populism with ersatz high-mindedness and lament the coarsening of popular taste. All these wonderful, serious films, and so few discerning customers paying money to see them! Offered an exquisite delicacy like ''The Reader,'' Americans flock to, um, ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop.'' Apparently you'd rather watch an overweight shopping center guard chase bad guys than watch an illiterate concentration camp guard have sex with a teenager. What is wrong with you people?
Underlying both the sighs of the art lovers and the grumblings of the democrats is a shared fantasy, a cloudy, rose-tinted memory of the days when good movies were popular and popular movies were good, and the Academy Awards floated serenely in the cultural mainstream. Remember ''The Godfather''? A heck of a picture, that one -- a blockbuster and a critical favorite, the film of the year and one for the ages. Those were the days.
Actually, though, there have been only about three or four such days in the eight-decade history of the Oscars -- serendipitous moments when mass taste, artistic distinction and a majority of academy votes magically fell into alignment. And it can happen again. But most of the time it doesn't. The best picture winner and its satellite laureates are filed away in the cabinets of cultural curiosities, while the parallel histories of cinematic accomplishment and fan behavior go on to write themselves.
In other words, the Oscars have always been trivial, and are best appreciated when they are allowed to be. They have over the years provided an annual sideshow, where the stars dress up, the host cracks awkward jokes and the viewing population feasts for a few hours on the inimitable combination of vulgarity and high-mindedness that defines the image of Hollywood.
And to the extent that this year's Oscars will uphold this tradition, supplying a dash of sentimentality, sweet (those ''Slumdog Millionaire'' kids) or bitter (Heath Ledger), a spoonful of suspense (Mickey Rourke or Sean Penn?) and perhaps even a surprise (Melissa Leo!), they may exceed the low expectations that surround them. But the problem -- the reason for those low expectations -- is that in the past decade these awards have transformed themselves from a harmless, annoying, sometimes enjoyable sideshow into the main event. Less through the ambitions of the academy itself than through a combination of entertainment-media overkill and film industry anxiety, the Oscars have taken on a cultural and economic importance that they can't possibly sustain and were never meant to have in the first place.
As studio profits have increasingly come from globally marketed, hugely expensive (and often pretty good) franchise movies, the less tangible but still vital reward of prestige has been passed down to a different class of movie. The ''A'' pictures of an earlier era (sweeping social dramas like ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' or bittersweet comedies like ''The Apartment'') have been reborn as the middle-sized, serious movies that dominate this newspaper's Friday arts section from October to Christmas. These tend to be literary adaptations (''Brokeback Mountain'' and ''Atonement'') or biographies of admirable figures of 20th-century history (''Capote'' and ''Ray'').
Sometimes one of the two or three remaining movie stars will be involved, but more often the casts are composed of actors whose reputations have been secured by previous awards and nominations. Similarly, the directors have usually achieved a level of name recognition that allows them to be referred to, in a shorthand whose theoretical origins are all but forgotten, as auteurs.
What unites these movies is Quality -- not as a designation of merit, but rather as a brand. Whether or not particular films qualify as successful works of art, the most important thing is that they be marketed successfully as art films, not in the old sense of being difficult or esoteric but in the tautological new sense of being the kind of movie that might qualify for an award.
And the kind of movie that does best is one that manages to blend art-house or ''indie'' cachet with old-fashioned populist appeal, combining a degree of originality with reliable and recognizable genre elements. That formula, which worked last year for ''No Country for Old Men'' -- a western and a heist movie as well as a prestigious literary adaptation -- has been wielded with particular success by Fox Searchlight, distributor of ''Slumdog Millionaire.''
For four of the last five years Searchlight has had a best picture nominee that manages to be both a scrappy little underdog and a specimen of an established mainstream breed. ''Sideways'' was a buddies-on-the-road comedy. ''Little Miss Sunshine'' was a family-on-the-road comedy. ''Juno'' was a teenage romantic comedy. And ''Slumdog'' is a twofer: a coming-of-age comedy and a fast-paced crime drama.
These are likable movies, and it's hard to begrudge them their success. But why should an industry award be the measure or the spur of that success? More to the point, why should the inability of other movies to occupy the narrow middle ground of Oscar-worthiness be taken as failure?
Each week, as the fall weather grows colder, a new batch arrives, first in New York and Los Angeles (sometimes by way of Cannes or Toronto) and then in other cities, and every movie is greeted with the same question: Will it get any nominations? The early answer will depend on reviews and on initial grosses; if those auguries look promising, more money will be spent trying to generate momentum, to spin news coverage and to solicit the favor of the voters.
To what end? The phrase ''Oscar campaign'' has entered the lexicon, but it's an odd kind of campaign, involving an office with neither symbolic nor actual power and a public that is constitutionally barred from voting. But perhaps the metaphor is military rather than political, since what is required is for one movie -- or five of them, in the early phases -- to wound, exhaust and ultimately kill the others.
The losers in this cultural blood sport are ambitious, idiosyncratic films that never get a fair chance at an audience, and filmgoers whose attention is distracted by endless, empty chatter about the state of the contest.
Or maybe not distracted. It seems just as likely that the vast, multifarious, unpredictable public is tuning out the Oscar noise and going to see, for example, Clint Eastwood's ''Gran Torino,'' which has made more money so far than any of his academy-honored efforts. Or maybe they're fanning out in search of DVDs of the interesting movies the academy overlooked, or taking comfort in the kind of entertainment the academy never seems to recognize. It may be that the more movies matter, the less the Oscars do. And vice versa.

HEADLINE: First, Let's Fix The Bonuses

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
''If you weren't getting a bonus, what would you not do? Would you take longer lunches, or leave early on Wednesday?''
So asked Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, of John J. Mack, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley. The tongue-in-cheek question was posed last week, when the C.E.O.'s of the eight largest financial institutions in the country -- all of whom had taken billions in government bailout money to shore up their balance sheets -- testified before the committee in a widely publicized hearing.
Mr. Mack didn't miss a beat. ''We love what we do,'' he replied smoothly. ''If we had no bonuses, we would still love it.''
To which I remember thinking: yeah, right. 
--
Ever since it was revealed that John A. Thain had paid out $3.6 billion in bonuses two days before Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America -- and just weeks before it posted a staggering fourth-quarter loss of $15.3 billion -- the country has been up in arms about Wall Street bonuses. According to the New York State comptroller's office, total 2008 Wall Street bonuses were $18.4 billion, a number that seemed so blatantly outrageous that President Obama condemned them. How can it be, people fume, that companies that have brought themselves down with their poor decision making and short-term greed, and have very nearly brought the country's financial system to its knees -- how can the employees of these companies still feel entitled to multimillion-dollar bonuses? How can they be so callous, so tone-deaf, so arrogant?
''When I'm trying to explain to my constituents why we are doing this stuff to help the financial system, they just want to talk about the bonuses,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. ''I can't ever get to the big picture because this keeps getting in the way.''
Mr. Dodd added testily, ''I would like to see one of these Wall Street guys go to a Caterpillar factory, where 20,000 people have lost their jobs, and explain why they need their bonus.''
Late last week, Mr. Dodd did something about Wall Street bonuses: he inserted an amendment into the stimulus package that pretty much chokes them off for the five top executives -- and, far more horrifying for Wall Street -- for the top 20 earners as well. The antibonus amendment applies to any company that has received bailout money (it gets tougher the more money a company has received) -- and the only sure way a company can get out from under these new strictures is to give back the taxpayers' money.
With the signing of the Dodd amendment into law this week, it's now Wall Street's turn to sputter in anger. Don't the politicians understand that the best performers will be most hurt by these new strictures? Wall Street executives mutter to themselves. Don't they realize that some of those companies didn't even want the bailout money--and only took it to because former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. forced them to? Don't people realize that this is just political pandering on Mr. Dodd's part?
''Dodd wants to pay people like congressmen,'' said Brian Foley, an independent executive compensation consultant, ''all up front and without regard to performance.''
I agree that the Dodd amendment is a poorly conceived piece of legislation that will have unintended consequences. But that doesn't mean the Wall Street bonus system isn't a problem. It is. Until the bonus system undergoes a long-term fix, Wall Street won't be fixed either.
--
It may seem hard to believe now, but Wall Street pay wasn't always in the stratosphere. ''When I became a partner at Lazard in 1961, my salary was $51,000,'' recalled Felix G. Rohatyn, perhaps the best-known investment banker of his era. ''And until I left the firm in 1997,'' he added, ''my compensation was always based on what percentage interest I had in the firm. Everybody was working for the greater interest of the firm.''
And why wouldn't they? Like all Wall Street firms in those days, Lazard Freres was a private partnership. Every year the partners drew a percentage of the annual profits as their compensation -- but they also had to keep most of their capital in the firm until they retired. They had a keen interest in ensuring that the firm had a healthy, long-term future.
Today's bonus system is a warped legacy of those old partnerships. Starting in the 1970s, Wall Street firms began going public, which meant that the partners' capital was replaced by shareholder equity. But the firms never abandoned the idea that salary was only a small portion of employee pay -- and that the big payoff came at the end of the year at bonus time.
In addition, trading began to overshadow advising as an investment bank's primary way of making money. Valuable traders whose operation made hundreds of millions of dollars for their firms demanded a significant piece of those profits for themselves -- or they took their services elsewhere. So that quaint notion that the firm's long-term health came first slowly gave way to a more cutthroat ethos. Whereas the incentives during the partnership era fostered loyalty to the firm, the new incentives turned everyone into a greedy free agent like, say, Alex Rodriguez.
By the time the late, great housing bubble was in full throttle, the compensation incentives were moving the financial system toward disaster. Firms made short-term underwriting fees for packaging mortgage-backed securities that have since become known as ''toxic assets.'' Traders booked short-term profits trading them (or simply marking them up). Executives pushed their subordinates to take more risk because that would yield more profits, and bigger bonuses. Nobody had any incentive to worry about whether those securities would someday ''blow up.'' Too much bonus money was at stake.
Is this the problem Mr. Dodd is trying to solve with his amendment? Alas, no. He seems mainly trying to send a message that people who take money from taxpayers need to show restraint. And surely they do.
But as Mr. Foley pointed out to me, the Dodd rules won't force the ones most responsible for the current problems to give back the tens of millions they made as they led their firms off the cliff. Secondly, Wall Street is actually right that the best performers will be hurt the most, and they'll jump ship. (It's already happening. Just recently, a group of Merrill Lynch bankers, shortly after getting their share of the Merrill booty, split for Deutsche Bank, which does not have any American bailout money.)
Perversely, under the Dodd rules, the merely above-average performers have a better chance of making the big bucks than the true superstars at the top. And finally, the new rules encourage firms to give back the bailout money to avoid the pay restrictions. Given the still-fragile state of the financial system, that's not a very smart idea.
What Wall Street really needs is smart pay incentives instead of dumb ones. Bonuses are not inherently evil -- indeed, they are probably a sensible way to encourage risk-taking -- so long as the bonuses reward genuine performance and calculated risk-taking, rather than the smoke-and-mirrors lunacy of the past few years. (The sheer size of bonuses, still based on the glory years, also needs to drop, though the market is likely to cure that problem as Wall Street's business continues to deteriorate. After all, you can't pay out money you don't have.)
Thus, instead of the Dodd amendment, wouldn't we be better off with an approach that requires everyone who gets a bonus to have a large chunk of it deferred? ''You can have a pool of cash and common equity that would comprise the compensation that is being deferred,'' said Jaidev R. Iyer, a managing director at the Global Association of Risk Professionals. ''That way everyone would have skin in the game in terms of the ongoing health of the firm.'' Traders would get the deferred portion of their bonus paid out over a number of years, as the profitability of their trades were assured. And if the trades went sour, traders would have to give some, or all, of their bonus back. That way, traders would have an incentive to act for the long term, instead of churning out short-term, often illusory, profits.
As it turns out, the one big Wall Street financial institution that comes closest to this approach is Mr. Mack's firm, Morgan Stanley. Last year, it instituted new bonus rules that say the more senior you are, the more of your bonus you get in stock. What's more, 65 percent of a trader's bonus is deferred, and it vests over three years. If deals or trades you worked on later go bad, that portion of the bonus can be clawed back by the firm. It's a step in the right direction.
During his testimony last week, Mr. Mack told the committee that he took no bonus in 2007 or 2008. He also likes to point out that in 2006, his bonus was all in stock.
I did a little checking. That 2006 bonus? It was worth $40 million at the time, making it, at least for a while, the largest bonus ever given to a Wall Street executive. No wonder he loves coming to work.

HEADLINE: Government Offers Look At Nation's Immigrants

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Indians are the best educated newcomers from overseas. Somalis are the youngest and poorest. Immigrants from Jordan and Bangladesh are most likely to be working in sales and office jobs. 
 Those are among the findings of a profile of the nation's foreign-born residents, legal or illegal, released this week by the Census Bureau.
 Over all, the profile indicates that Latin Americans and Africans account for a greater share of the nation's immigrant population than they did five years ago. In 1990, 22 percent of the foreign-born residents were from Mexico. By 2007, 31 percent were. 
 In 2007, the Census Bureau found, 54 percent of the nation's 38.1 million foreign-born came from Latin America, 27 percent from Asia, 13 percent from Europe and 4 percent from Africa. 
 More came from Mexico -- 11.7 million -- than from any other country, followed by China, the Philippines, India, El Salvador, Vietnam and South Korea. 
 Dominican immigrants accounted for 2 percent of the foreign-born -- the same as the share of Canadians and the same percentage as Germans as recently as 2000. Indians made up 4 percent of the foreign-born.
 A separate analysis found wide disparities among foreigners, especially Mexicans, being drawn to different regions.
 ''The new immigrant magnets, especially in the Southeast, are disproportionately attracting young Mexican men who are willing to accept low wages,'' said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. ''They have a lower potential to assimilate into the community than foreign-born Mexicans going to other destinations, and, as a result, they may be more prone to leave as economic opportunities continue to dry up in construction and related industries.''
 The profile found that immigrants are about as likely to have graduated from college as native-born Americans, 27 percent compared to 28 percent. (Seventy-four percent of Indian immigrants have a bachelor's degree.)
 Those from India, Australia, South Africa and the Philippines had the highest median household incomes, with the figure for Indians at $91,195. Those from Somalia and the Dominican Republic had among the lowest. The median for the foreign born was $46,881 compared with $51,249 among the native born.
 The oldest immigrants were from Europe (Hungarians, Italians, Greeks, Germans and Irish all had median ages of about 60 or more) while Somalis had the youngest median age (26.8).
 A disproportionately high percentage of Nigerians and Kenyans are employed or looking for work. 
 Fully 97 percent of immigrants from Mexico and the Dominican Republic do not speak English at home. About 52 percent of foreign-born residents say they speak English less than very well.
 Americans born in the Netherlands and Ireland had the lowest poverty rates (5 percent). Somalis had the highest (51 percent).

HEADLINE: In a Global Spree, China Buys Up Commodities

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
China is taking advantage of the economic downturn to go on a major shopping spree, investing in energy and other natural resources that could give it an economic advantage it has never had before.
 Some economic analysts say they believe that China's investments pose a threat to competitors like the United States. In the last move, Beijing said on Friday that one of its big state-owned banks, the China Development Bank, would lend the Brazilian oil giant Petrobras $10 billion in exchange for a long-term commitment to send oil to China. 
 China signed similar deals this week with Russia and Venezuela, bringing Beijing's total oil investments this month to $41 billion. They represent an important investment. Supplies of commodities like oil are likely to tighten again once global growth picks up, and China will have a toehold it lacked during the recent boom, when it grew phenomenally even with limited access to resources. 
 But some analysts say China's recent investments are welcome because they will help finance much-needed development, increasing the global supply of oil and natural resources at a time when many of the world's biggest banks are reluctant to lend.
 ''It's a good thing because a lot of projects have been postponed,'' said Prof. Philip Andrews-Speed, director of the energy policy center at the University of Dundee in Scotland. ''Oil companies may now have the money to produce oil.''
 It is not just oil. This month, China's biggest aluminum producer also agreed to invest $19.5 billion in Rio Tinto, an Australian mining company that is one of the world's biggest. On Monday, China Minmetals bid $1.7 billion to acquire OZ Minerals, also of Australia, a huge zinc mining company.
 China is flush with cash -- thanks to trillions of dollars from decades of selling goods to the West -- at a time when credit markets are tight and collapsing commodity prices have left energy and natural resource companies desperate for cash. For many of these companies, China has gone from pariah to lender of first resort.
 ''This is heavy energy diplomacy,'' Professor Andrews-Speed said. ''If you need money, you go to where the money is, and today, China's the place.''
 President Hu Jintao of China traveled this week on his ''Friendship and Cooperation Tour'' in Africa, where China has huge interests in resources and mining. The vice president, Xi Jinping, visited South America, met with the leaders of Brazil and Venezuela and signed cooperation agreements on oil and minerals.
 Venezuela borrowed $6 billion from China and agreed to increase its oil exports to China, bringing China's total investment in the country to $12 billion. In Brazil, China signed a $10 billion ''loan-for-oil'' deal that guarantees the country up to 160,000 barrels a day at market prices.
 And in Beijing this week, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao met his Russian counterpart after China agreed to lend Russia's struggling oil giant Rosneft and Russia's oil pipeline company, Transneft, $25 billion in exchange for 15 million tons of crude oil a year for 20 years. 
 The investments are China's biggest moves since 2005, when a Chinese state-owned oil company made an unsuccessful bid for Unocal, the American oil company, prompting worries about whether fast-growing China was seeking to tie up global resources.
 But the world has changed drastically since then. Commodity prices have fallen sharply in recent months, after a long bull market that was partly fueled by China's voracious demand for energy and resources. And China has built up nearly $2 trillion in foreign currency reserves, giving the country easy access to capital.
 ''What's changed for China is that their key competitive strength has increased, and that's capital,'' said Andrew Driscoll, a resources analyst at CLSA, an investment bank. ''A lot of companies are begging for capital.''
 China wants reliable supplies of crude oil to fuel its growing transport sector; it needs iron ore for steel production, and copper and aluminum to build homes and consumer goods.
 Analysts say there are still worries about whether China will compete with other nations, like the United States and India, for oil and other natural resources.
 Analysts say China could continue to make deals this year for small oil and gas companies, mineral producers and mining firms.
 This week, for instance, shares of the Fortescue Metals Group, an Australian mining company, rose after reports the company was in talks with China over a big investment to help the company expand operations.
 In many cases, China has struck deals in countries that have access to large supplies of oil and minerals but where American and European countries are not well positioned, like parts of Africa and the Middle East. In one of the deals struck this week, China made an alliance with the government of Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela, who has denounced American leadership. While the oil deals announced this week vary in terms, analysts say they ensure China a steady supply of oil for decades to come, sometimes at favorable prices.

HEADLINE: Changing Climate Numbers

 BODY:
In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its fourth assessment report, summarizing evidence collected and weighed by scientists around the world. At the time, it was the best estimate of where the planet was, climatically speaking, and where it was likely to be going, and the news the report offered was daunting. 
 There was unequivocal evidence of a warming climate, with human activity the dominant cause. The panel warned that further warming could have devastating consequences for societies around the world, including rising seas and widespread drought. 
 The 2007 assessment established a base line of expectation, but it is already looking outdated. From all over the globe, in bits and pieces, data are accumulating that suggest we may have already left behind the world of possibilities portrayed in the panel's report. Sea ice has melted more quickly than expected. And, according to a recent report from the United States Geological Survey, sea levels in 2100 could increase by more than double the 1.5 feet rise projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (it chose not to add in water from eroding ice sheets because they remain poorly understood). Add to that the hard reality that carbon dioxide is a long-lived gas, and the picture of global warming is both volatile and forbidding.
 The authors of the climate-change panel's report knew that events could overtake their findings. A fifth assessment is currently under way. And while the worldwide recession might provide a slight breather, population pressures and energy demands are likely to drive emissions inexorably higher without a major shift to new energy sources.
 It is imperative, of course, that the Obama administration -- and every other government around the world -- keep abreast of the changing data. What is equally imperative is that the governments tailor any prescriptions to the possibility of more ominous news in the future.

HEADLINE: Saab in Bankruptcy Filing; G.M. Seeks More Aid

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Ian Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa, Nick Bunkley from Detroit and Carter Dougherty from Frankfurt.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Saab, the Swedish automaker, filed for bankruptcy protection Friday and asked its government for financial support to remain in business as an independent company, separate from General Motors, its parent.
 It was the latest example of auto companies asking governments in different countries -- including the United States and Canada -- to step in with aid, opening the door to those governments playing a direct role in deciding the future form of their automobile industries.
 ''This looks to me like it's going to be a subsidized industry forever,'' said Donald R. Grimes, an economist with the University of Michigan. ''And then the question becomes, do you view it as a public benefit that the government should provide?'' 
 Hours after Saab made its case to the Swedish government, General Motors submitted a request to the Canadian government approaching $6 billion, which is double the amount it previously said it would seek, according to Michael Bryant, the economic development minister for Ontario.
 Chrysler Canada similarly did not offer a specific amount it was seeking. But in a letter to the governments of Canada and Ottawa released Friday, the company asked for 25 percent of what it has requested from the United States, or $3.75 billion. The Canadian governments had set aside $1 billion Canadian for the company.
 Like G.M., Chrysler said that if Canada provided aid, it would not close any plants in the country.
 On Tuesday, the two Detroit companies raised the amount they were seeking from the Treasury Department to nearly $40 billion. The presidential panel reviewing the requests held its first meeting Friday.
 More industry requests to government officials are likely to come. G.M. said Friday it would need more than the $2.3 billion in loan guarantees it discussed with the German government for its Opel division. A reorganization plan for Opel, G.M.'s second-biggest brand behind Chevrolet, is expected at the end of next week.
 G.M. said earlier this week that it wanted to cut Saab loose by 2010, as it tries to restructure. G.M. said in a report to the Treasury Department that it planned to end financial support for Saab by next year.
 Saab went to a Swedish court for protection from its creditors, and said it would -- with assistance from the Swedish government -- reorganize to pave the way for private investors to buy all or part of the company.
 After exploring Saab's options, ''it was determined a formal reorganization would be the best way to create a truly independent entity that is ready for investment,'' Saab's managing director, Jan-Ake Jonsson, said in a statement.
 Saab said it would need financing during its three-month restructuring ''from both public and private sources'' and ''would continue to operate as usual.''
 Elisabeth Thand Ringqvist, a spokeswoman for the Swedish industry ministry, said Saab would be eligible for help through loan guarantees provided to the Swedish auto industry as part of a support package the government approved in December.
 ''This could be interpreted as the government supporting Saab in the reorganization phase,'' Ms. Ringqvist said. But she said guarantees for working capital, like what G.M. is seeking in Germany, were not on the table.
 A bailout for Opel is politically contentious in Germany, with politicians calling for strict conditions on the package. Some have even called for Opel to be taken out of American hands, but it is tightly integrated into the G.M. supply and technology chain. For example, G.M. uses Opel underpinnings for vehicles sold by Saturn, although G.M. plans to dissolve the Saturn unit by 2012.
 In Canada, Mr. Bryant said the Ontario and Canadian governments were negotiating with G.M. over whether the government would provide additional help in financing a pension shortfall. 
 In its plan, General Motors of Canada said that it expected to employ about 7,000 workers next year. The company had about 20,000 employees in 2005. It also intends to have 450 to 500 Canadian dealers, compared with the current 700.
 Professor Grimes said government leaders the world over would face enormous public pressure to aid the auto companies. ''Politically, I don't think they will have a choice,'' he said.
 But, ''the automakers could become quasi-government agencies,'' he said. ''It will be up to the government to determine what wages the workers get paid, what holidays they get and what benefits they receive.''
 Swedish officials have repeatedly resisted efforts to nationalize Saab, which came to life as part of the Svenska Aeroplan, a firm founded in 1937 to build military planes. The first Saab cars were built after World War II. 
 Saab, long known for quirky vehicles with ignition in the floor and a griffin insignia, became a more conventional brand under G.M. It borrowed the underpinnings from some of Opel's cars for its lineup, which includes sedans, wagons and a sport utility vehicle.
 Saab, however, is G.M.'s smallest brand in the United States, selling 21,383 vehicles in 2008, down 34.7 percent from 2007. Its best-selling vehicle is the 9-3, of which G.M. sold just over 10,000 cars last year.
 Nonetheless, dealers said they were optimistic about Saab's future. ''It's probably a great time for someone to get a bargain deal on a car company,'' said Annette Adams, owner of Iowa City Saab.
 Her dealership sells about 50 Saabs a year, while her husband's Saab dealership, Saab Meyer Garage, sells a similar number.
 She predicted Saab would thrive under new ownership. ''I look for good things to come,'' she added. ''We just have to step across the hot coals to get there.''

HEADLINE: Diamond Sales, and Prices, Plunge

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Diamonds may be forever, but apparently diamond buyers are more fickle.
 Tiffany, the famed jewelry chain on Fifth Avenue in New York, is struggling even after lowering prices. In Botswana, at one of the biggest diamond mines in the world, the effects are being felt by workers who have been told to remain on an extended Christmas vacation to help De Beers, the giant producer, adjust to the sudden slump.
 After enjoying more than two decades of almost uninterrupted price increases amid buoyant demand, the global diamond business is suffering along with many other luxury businesses. Retail sales dropped as much as 20 percent over the year-end holidays in the United States, which is responsible for about half of the world's demand for diamonds. 
 But the industry is different from other luxury businesses because it is based on a commodity. And that commodity is no longer entirely under the control of De Beers, which used to be able to maintain high diamond prices by restricting supply.
 Hopes that the growing wealth in India and China would fill the demand gap were dashed once recession spread to Asia, prompting prices for diamonds to drop by roughly 30 percent from an August peak.
 ''The whole industry has stalled as it has been hit by the recession,'' said Christine Gordon, an independent diamond industry analyst in London. ''This is going to go on for a while and in the meantime production cuts will be necessary.''
 De Beers, the world's largest diamond producer, said Friday that sales in the fourth quarter slowed and that 2009 would remain ''challenging.''
 Strong demand for diamonds in the first three quarters of last year helped De Beers increase yearly sales to $6.89 billion, from $6.84 billion. But sales in November and December were ''below expectations,'' Gareth Penny, the company's group managing director, said.
 As recently as September, De Beers could not get diamonds out of the ground fast enough. But since the financial crisis took a sharp turn for the worse after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in mid-September, De Beers has had to reduce production by shortening workweeks, introducing more flexible hours and shifting workers away from digging to mine maintenance.
 De Beers, in which the mining giant Anglo American owns a 45 percent stake, controls about 40 percent of the diamond market. The company said in January that it would reduce the production of rough gems by about 50 percent through April.
 A De Beers unit also recently shelved a deal to acquire half of a Russian gem miner because of the financial crisis; another subsidiary just terminated a production agreement at a mine in South Africa.
 Other producers are also suffering. Alrosa, the Russian state-run diamond miner, sharply reduced its annual profit forecast in December, citing falling demand. And the jewelry retailer Fortunoff and a smaller rival, Shane, have filed for bankruptcy protection.
 But the seeds of the diamond industry's troubles were planted even before the downturn, as producers accumulated a large inventory and took on excessive debt.
 The production overhang is mainly the result of a strategic change at De Beers about 10 years ago. When Cecil Rhodes, the swashbuckling British-born businessman, founded De Beers in the 19th century, the company established a tight grip on the diamond market and kept the price of diamonds on a steady upward arc by buying excess supply.
 The system worked wonders for decades but became unsustainable as competition from smaller miners increased and demand for other luxury goods replaced consumer appetite for gemstones. De Beers changed its strategy and started to sell rough diamonds at 10 annual auctions, but it was still stuck with a stockpile of roughly $4 billion in diamonds.
 The immediate outlook is grim. Chaim Even-Zohar, manager of Tacy, an industry consulting firm in Israel, said he expected demand for rough diamonds to decline by at least 60 percent this year, leading to a further price drop of about 25 percent.
 Recent price declines prompted Angola and other countries whose economies rely heavily on the industry to consider buying diamonds to keep them off the market. Indeed, Russia has already bought some products from Alrosa.
 In Botswana, where the mining giant Debswana is a joint venture between De Beers and the government, lawmakers have warned of the devastating effects a mine closure or a fire sale of assets could have on the country's economic, social and development projects, since diamonds account for about two-thirds of its exports.
 The $20 billion industry is grappling with corporate debt levels that ballooned to a combined $22 billion in 2008. The reluctance of banks to lend coincides with a drop in the value of diamonds that companies use as a security for loans.
 The immediate outlook for the industry might look bleak, but some analysts said that once the production overhang worked itself through the system, prices would recover. Without new discoveries, Mr. Even-Zohar expects the world to run out of new diamonds within 20 years.
 As demand recovers, any diamond shortage would drive up prices and revive mining. ''The long-term fundamentals look good,'' Mr. Even-Zohar said. ''But in the meantime countries and populations will suffer.''

HEADLINE: Want to Run the N.Y.C. Marathon? Get Out Your Checkbook

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
The application process opened Thursday for the 40th running of the New York City Marathon on Nov. 1. The first big road races of the year have had record fields, so the marathon's registration, which closes June 1, could increase for 2009. 
 The marathon has already had another significant increase. With the economic outlook uncertain, the organization that directs the race has raised its entry fees. 
 Members of the New York Road Runners will pay $13 more than they did last year, with the fee increasing to $138. Nonmembers will pay $171, an extra $16, and those from other countries entering the international lottery will pay $21 more, $231. The New York City Marathon is the most expensive premium marathon in the country.
 ''As much as we'd like not to raise the prices, it was necessary at this time,'' said Mary Wittenberg, the president and chief executive of the Road Runners.
 Wittenberg estimated that the organization's cost per runner ''is easily more than $250.'' The entry fee was increased even though organizers realized the economy could worsen, Wittenberg said, and the marathon's costs -- such as cancellation insurance, liability insurance and special promotions for the race's 40th anniversary -- could rise. 
 ''We're sitting in a marketplace where we have to anticipate that costs will be up and revenue will be down,'' Wittenberg said.
 The race's title sponsor, the embattled Dutch financial services company ING, is still committed to the marathon through 2010. 
 ''We're a not-for-profit, we can't afford to lose money and we're trying to break even,'' Wittenberg said, adding that the Road Runners decided not to raise its $40 membership fee this year. 
 Besides the marathon entry fee, the Road Runners charges an application processing fee of $11 (unchanged from last year). That fee is nonrefundable, which has led to frustration in the running world over paying for the right to be rejected. 
 Of the approximately 83,000 people (including automatic qualifiers and charity group runners) paying the $11 fee in 2008, 53,146 gained entry to last year's race. After cancellations and deferrals, the 2008 race had 38,832 starters.
 Wittenberg acknowledged the complaints and said the $11 fee went toward technology and other operating costs. ''In an over-subscribed field, it does help ensure that there is a level of commitment of those individuals who sign up,'' she said. 
 New York was not the only popular race to raise its entry fees this year. The Walt Disney World Marathon and Half Marathon in Orlando, Fla., raised its fees by $20 to deal with rising costs that included labor, T-shirts, medals and insurance, said the race director, Jon Hughes. 
 ''Putting on the race has just become more expensive,'' he said.
 It was the largest jump in fees in the history of the Disney marathon, which was founded in 1994 and was run on Jan. 11. Despite the increase, the races registered record fields. There was no application fee. 
 Along with Orlando, marathons and half-marathons in Miami, Houston and Phoenix last month also drew larger fields than ever.
 The Boston Marathon, which will be run April 19, closed its registration on Jan. 26, capping the field at 25,000. Runners with qualifying times from the United States paid $110 ($116 if they registered online), and $150 for international runners ($6 more online).

HEADLINE: Taking the Slum Out of 'Slumdog'

BYLINE: By MATIAS ECHANOVE and RAHUL SRIVASTAVA. 
Matias Echanove and Rahul Srivastava are affiliated with the research collective Partners for Urban Knowledge Action and Research.

DATELINE: Mumbai, India 

 BODY:
 IT does not take much to galvanize protest against a movie in India, but few thought the word ''slumdog'' would cause so much anger -- especially as hundreds of Bollywood titles translate into much worse slurs. We had to pay attention, though, when friends from Mumbai's sprawling Dharavi area joined hands with those demonstrating against the Oscar-nominated film ''Slumdog Millionaire.'' The Indian media widely reported that the outrage was over the word ''dog.'' But what we heard from Manju Keny, a college student living in Dharavi, was something else. She was upset at the word ''slum.'' We could not agree more. 
 In truth, the movie never claims to be a portrait of Dharavi, though some of the most spectacular scenes were shot there, including depictions of the anti-Muslim riots of 1992. The director, Danny Boyle, constructs a cinematic slum out of many pockets around Mumbai. The opening sequence has children playing near the airport, being chased by policemen and ending up -- in a moment of pure Hollywood magic -- a few miles away in Dharavi. 
 The imagery represents what most middle-class residents of Mumbai (and now all over the world) imagine Dharavi to be. The urban legend of its squalor has taken root because few Mumbaikers have ever been there -- just as most Manhattanites still avoid stepping anywhere near Bedford-Stuyvesant, that beautiful neighborhood in Brooklyn. Times may have changed since the mid-'70s, when the community worker Barry Stein described Bed-Stuy as the ''largest ghetto in the country,'' but prejudices die hard, in New York and India. 
 Its depiction as a slum does little justice to the reality of Dharavi. Well over a million ''eyes on the street,'' to use Jane Jacobs's phrase, keep Dharavi perhaps safer than most American cities. Yet Dharavi's extreme population density doesn't translate into oppressiveness. The crowd is efficiently absorbed by the thousands of tiny streets branching off bustling commercial arteries. Also, you won't be chased by beggars or see hopeless people loitering -- Dharavi is probably the most active and lively part of an incredibly industrious city. People have learned to respond in creative ways to the indifference of the state -- including having set up a highly functional recycling industry that serves the whole city. 
 Dharavi is all about such resourcefulness. Over 60 years ago, it started off as a small village in the marshlands and grew, with no government support, to become a million-dollar economic miracle providing food to Mumbai and exporting crafts and manufactured goods to places as far away as Sweden.
 No master plan, urban design, zoning ordinance, construction law or expert knowledge can claim any stake in the prosperity of Dharavi. It was built entirely by successive waves of immigrants fleeing rural poverty, political oppression and natural disasters. They have created a place that is far from perfect but has proved to be amazingly resilient and able to upgrade itself. In the words of Bhau Korde, a social worker who lives there, ''Dharavi is an economic success story that the world must pay attention to during these times of global depression.'' 
 Understanding such a place solely by the generic term ''slum'' ignores its complexity and dynamism. Dharavi's messy appearance is nothing but an expression of intense social and economic processes at work. Most homes double as work spaces: when morning comes, mattresses are folded, and tens of thousands of units form a decentralized production network rivaling the most ruthless of Chinese sweatshops in efficiency. Mixed-use habitats have often shaped urban histories. Look at large parts of Tokyo. Its low-rise, high-density mixed-use cityscape and intricate street network have emerged through a similar Dharaviesque logic. The only difference is that people's involvement in local development in Tokyo was seen as legitimate. 
 Building on what exists, rather than clearing it for redevelopment, may preserve not only the character of a place but also its economic vibrancy. In Dharavi, it would allow all residents to leverage their most precious asset: a place to live and work. Slum-rehabilitation projects in Mumbai often end up creating new slums elsewhere as they increase real-estate value in the places they redevelop. 
 In the movie, when the protagonists return to their childhood haunts, they find that multistoried apartments have replaced the old decrepit structures, giving the impression of urban mobility and transformation. What the camera doesn't reveal are the enormous shantytowns hidden behind those glistening towers, waiting to be redeveloped all over again.
 In many ways, Dharavi is the ultimate user-generated city. Each of its 80-plus neighborhoods has been incrementally developed by generations of residents updating their shelters and businesses according to needs and means. As Ramesh Misra, a lawyer and lifelong resident, puts it: ''We have always improved Dharavi by ourselves. All we want is permission and support to keep doing it. Is that asking for too much?''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Takes Another Run at a Major New York Employer

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The cross-border war for jobs is heating up again.
 New Jersey has offered the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, a major employer in Lower Manhattan, a lucrative subsidy package if it moves its offices and 1,600 employees to the west side of the Hudson River.
 State and city officials in New York are also negotiating with Depository Trust over enticements to keep the company's main offices at 55 Water Street, where its lease expires in 2012. 
 The competition for jobs among New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania were relatively quiet during the boom years. But with layoffs coming by the tens of thousands and corporations suddenly in a cost-conscious mode, governments are once again outbidding one another for employers. And critics contend it is at taxpayers' expense.
 Earlier this month, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority granted tentative approval for a 10-year grant to Depository Trust, worth an estimated $74.6 million, under the state's business employment incentive program. The grant would be based on a rebate of state income taxes should the company move to New Jersey, according to Glen J. Philips, a spokesman for New Jersey's development authority.
 Depository Trust holds, clears and trades securities for brokerage firms and banks; it is intimately connected to the business of Wall Street.
 Stuart Z. Goldstein, a managing director of Depository Trust, confirmed that the company was exploring its options, but said that it was early in the process and that no decisions have been made. 
 Depository Trust may be the kind of company Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had in mind on Wednesday when he discussed the city's job initiatives and competition across the Hudson. ''The State of New Jersey, unfortunately, has been recruiting our companies here in New York City very aggressively,'' he said, ''and we're working as hard as we can to keep them here.''
 Or, real estate brokers say, he could have been referring to ImClone Systems, a biotechnology company acquired by Eli Lilly last year for $6.5 billion. ImClone has offices downtown on Varick Street, although some officials are trying to lure the company to the city's nascent East River Science Park in Manhattan. The brokers said that New Jersey is also wooing ImClone, which has offices in Branchburg, N.J.
 New Jersey usually trumpets its lower taxes and office rents, although rents are falling sharply in New York. Critics say that no one wins when states compete against one another by offering increasingly large tax breaks.
 ''Cross-border wars in the metropolitan region are truly counterproductive, since this is one economy where governments should be working in sync,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, an alliance of the city's largest companies. ''During a recession and fiscal crisis, when the public sector can barely afford to maintain essential services, it makes no sense to drive up the cost of business incentive packages.''
 In the past, New York companies routinely visited potential office sites in New Jersey to leverage subsidies from New York. With the exception of subsidies for Goldman Sachs and the New York Yankees, Mayor Bloomberg has been far more stingy on this front than his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
 ''We take the potential loss of any employers seriously and actively engage with these companies,'' said David Lombino, a spokesman for the New York City Economic Development Corporation. ''In the long term, we're confident that our strategy -- to invest taxpayer money to keep the city a place businesses want to be, rather than competing with other cities' offers of incentives -- will generate the greatest return for New York's taxpayers.''
 This is not the first time that Depository Trust has gone to the public well. Fourteen years ago, Mr. Giuliani gave the company a tax break worth $18.5 million after the company threatened to leave New York.
 ''We were strongly wooed by New Jersey, and without the incentives, we just can't justify what the cost of the lease would have been,'' Edward McGuire, corporate secretary of Depository Trust, said in June 1995.

HEADLINE: Hospitality Begins at Home in the Family Palace

BYLINE: By PERRY GARFINKEL

 BODY:
PADMAJA KUMARI MEWAR straddles several worlds -- old and new, East and West. 
 She was born into a family of Indian royalty, maharanas who call themselves ''custodians'' over the region surrounding the city of Udaipur in India and who trace their lineage back 1,500 years through 77 generations. 
 But both by choice and necessity, Ms. Mewar, 29 years old, and her generation seem increasingly removed from the insular wealth and privilege of their ancestors. Ms. Mewar said in an interview that she ''could have chosen to live a very luxurious lifestyle without lifting a finger,'' but following the entrepreneurial leads of her father and grandfather into the global business community proved too compelling. 
 She moved to the United States to complete high school at Northfield Mount Hermon School in western Massachusetts, then earned a degree in international relations from Tulane University. She went to work as an events coordinator at Burlington Capital Markets in New York and from there, the Four Seasons New York, where over two years she worked her way up from the front desk to special services liaison for the hotel's top 100 guests. 
 Ms. Mewar returned to Udaipur in 2006 to join HRH Hotels, a collection of about a dozen resorts and former Mewar family palaces and hunting lodges that was founded by her grandfather. She lives with her parents and brother in the centuries-old family palace.
 Ms. Mewar is now joint managing director of the hotel company and travels extensively to promote the chain. 
 Though India's tourism economy suffered after the attacks on Mumbai in November, the country is still ranked first in the world for 10-year growth potential by the World Travel & Tourism Council. But Ms. Mewar said she was pursuing new markets to expand the family business.
 Q.Youcome from an upbringing in which you must have been served hand and foot, and yet now you're in the hospitality industry serving others?
 A. Hospitality was not and is not a business for us; it's a way of life. Historically, my family has been the official welcoming committee for visiting dignitaries. But it's erroneous to think I grew up spoiled. Yes, we had privilege but our parents taught us very early that with privilege comes responsibility -- thus ''custodianship.'' My late grandfather, Maharana Bhagwat Singhji, established a charitable foundation in 1969 to preserve the region's heritage and develop better local educational infrastructure. My father, Shriji Arvind Singh Mewar, added health care and support for regional crafts and arts, recently involving the Getty Foundation in our preservation initiatives. I am forging new associations with local nongovernmental organizations, such as Alakh Nayan Mandir, a medical institution dedicated to eye care, and Seva Mandir, a group advocating women's rights. The rewarding part is when people come up to me when I visit their centers, they just want a hug. I have the means. But it's the human connection that gives my support meaning.
 Q.How do you compare the styles of service between India and the West?
 A. Service isn't necessarily part of the culture in the West. It has to be taught. In India, it's in our DNA. We learn it in our nuclear families from the earliest age. On the other hand, Westerners deliver a kind of seamless service I admire. You don't see the waiter refilling your glass but it gets done. In India, sometimes you feel everyone hovering over you -- until you need something, that is. It's something I am very conscious of as we train employees who work more and more with our international guests. Working at the Four Seasons job, I saw Americans get things done because they are clear and simple. They know the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Indians tend to solve problems in a more circular fashion but are beginning to see there are more efficient strategies. 
 Q.What are you doing to respond to the double whammy India is dealing with now, between the global economic downturn and any reduction in travel to India due to the attacks?
 A. At the trade show I just came from in Madrid, I was heartened to hear that people are still keenly interested in and fascinated by India. Surviving the attacks has actually increased people's appreciation of our fortitude. But hearing the reality of the slowdown in Europe and the United States, I came home more committed to exploring and opening new markets. Diversifying is the key these days. That's why next month I am going to Germany and Russia, two segments with vast potential that we have not fully tapped.
 Also, I feel well positioned, even through these times, because of the growing trend of authenticity, a word that's already in danger of becoming a cliche in the hospitality world. Guests know the difference between brand-new hotels built to look like 200-year-old palaces and actual 200-year-old palaces turned into hotels with modern amenities and history that's palpable everywhere. Hospitality is like fashion. Both thrive on changing styles and tastes. But our kind of authentic is timeless.
 Q.How do you explain the dichotomy between the perception and the reality of India, between the booming economy we read about in headlines and the India that many in the West saw for the first time in ''Slumdog Millionaire''?
 A. Yes, there is poverty. Yes, there is illiteracy, overpopulation and massive traffic. We are dealing with them the best we can. It's another cliche, but India really is like the proverbial blind men and the elephant. It all depends on what part you touch, what your perception is. The reality is we are like our famous biryani dish, a mix of spices, rice, and vegetarian or non-vegetarian.

HEADLINE: For High Earners, Day Of Reckoning With Taxman

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
This is the season of scam allegations, from Bernie Madoff to Stanford Financial with a clutch of smaller swindles in between. What hasn't received as much attention are the personal Ponzi schemes that are about to come crashing down. What I'm referring to are the people who calculated ways to delay their tax payments.
 The yearly income for these people consists mostly of a lump sum payment -- bonus, partnership distribution, restricted stock. Many of them have generally paid the minimum tax during the year and waited to even up with the government. High earners have regularly used part of the current year's windfall to pay taxes owed from the last one. As long as they filed their tax return on time, there was no penalty. 
 But this tax season, with bonuses down across various industries, these personal Ponzi schemes are crumbling. Many bankers, hedge fund partners, venture capitalists, and even lawyers and doctors are struggling to come up with the money they owe the Internal Revenue Service. 
 ''If you didn't withhold properly, you now have to pay taxes and have less money to pay those taxes,'' said Joseph Spada, managing director at Summit Financial Resources, an investment adviser in Parsippany, N.J. 
 He singled out clients who worked at Morgan Stanley. He said several clients, whose restricted stock units converted into actual shares in the fourth quarter, opted to have the minimum withheld or even borrowed money to pay the tax. 
 Typically, people sell enough stock to cover the tax on the day they receive their grants. But this year, they either thought the stock would go back up or they needed the extra money for expenses. But Morgan Stanley's stock didn't go back up. Shares fell to $16.04 on Dec. 31, from $41.36 on Sept. 5. 
 ''The units went to shares and they went off a cliff,'' Mr. Spada said. ''Now you still owe taxes on a $40 stock.''
 His Morgan clients are far from alone. Current tax law calls for an automatic 35 percent deduction for cash bonuses over $1 million. Those under that threshold, however, can select the minimum tax withholding of 25 percent. Even taking into account their deductions, they could still owe $50,000 to $75,000, said Joseph Toce, head of the New York office of WTAS, a tax accounting and consulting firm. 
 The biggest debtor this year could be the once high-flying hedge fund partner, particularly if he received his deferred fee income early last year. When the payments are distributed to partners, they are made without withholding and the recipients are responsible for paying the tax. (This is because they are often held in offshore accounts and do not face the same withholding requirements.)
 In the bull market, the partner took his check worth tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars, and invested it until tax time. At the end of the year, he paid Uncle Sam and pocketed whatever he earned in the market from not paying the tax months earlier. This year, if the same partner followed that strategy, he may well have far less than he started with. 
 And because many of these high earners never had to worry before about paying their taxes, they are likely to be completely blindsided by a humongous tax bill this year. ''They always made more than enough money to satisfy their income tax and lifestyle obligations,'' said William Woodson, managing director in the family wealth management group at Credit Suisse in Chicago.
 In other words, they lived to the limit of their means, like so many less wealthy people, and now they are being called to account. The difference, though, is that the I.R.S. has a huge incentive to strike a deal with them. They are, after all, the biggest taxpayers in the system. And the difference between the 25 or 28 percent they have already paid and the 43 percent that Mr. Spada says his high net worth clients typically owe is millions of dollars per person. 
 Unlike other Ponzi schemes that have fallen apart recently, these personal ones will be resolved because the aggrieved party is the I.R.S. Here is some advice for people who find themselves in this situation: 
 DON'T HIDE Avoiding the issue only makes it worse. This is good advice for anyone who owes money to the I.R.S. 
 The temptation is not to file a return if you cannot pay the taxes you owe. Not only will the I.R.S. charge you interest for your delinquent payment, it will charge you penalties that could have been avoided by filing for an extension. 
 ''People want to dodge the tax collector until they're flush,'' Mr. Woodson said. ''That catches up with everyone. Whether you're worth $10 million or $100,000, the outcome is the same.''
 The smart thing to do is file your tax return and tell the I.R.S. your situation.
 PLAY LET'S MAKE A DEAL Believe it or not, the I.R.S. is a fair creditor. It wants what you owe, no more, no less. This may remind people of the old joke -- ''I'm from the government and I'm here to help you.'' But it is more true now than ever. 
 ''You can work with the government if you're up front with them and approach them,'' Mr. Toce said. ''In this climate, the I.R.S. is generally understanding.''
 That said, the I.R.S. is not going to let you hold onto your ski chalet while you claim you cannot pay your taxes. A laid-off auto worker has a better chance of having his tax obligation forgiven than an analyst who complains that the market for villas in Vail is too depressed to sell. 
 INTEREST RATE ARBITRAGE When the economy started to collapse last winter, people who paid estimated quarterly taxes -- partners, say, in venture capital or private equity funds -- decided to skip them. This was not illegal. It just meant that they would have to make up those payments, with interest, come April. The bet was that the interest rate they would have to pay would be far less than what they could earn investing that money on their own.
 These same people may be in the worst straits now. The silver lining is that the government's penalty rates are at historic lows. The I.R.S. Web site says the penalty for not paying taxes is 0.5 percent a month, which works out to 6 percent a year. While it is never ideal to owe the government money, if cash flow is constrained, the deal may be better than a loan from a private bank and certainly from an American Express Platinum card. 
 TIME IS ON YOUR SIDE The good thing about negotiating with a large government bureaucracy is that it moves slowly. 
 ''For practical purposes, the day of reckoning generally does not come for 12, 18, 24 months,'' Mr. Woodson said. ''During that time, wealthy individuals are able to create the liquidity they need to satisfy their obligations.''
 There is a limit to the taxman's patience, of course. If your day comes and you say you cannot pay your taxes, the I.R.S. will take a cold, hard look at your assets and make you satisfy your debt. 
 ''The I.R.S. won't go away,'' Mr. Woodson said. ''Your debt won't be forgiven.''

HEADLINE: Harvard Endowment Chief Is Earning Degree in Crisis Management

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Harvard may be the nation's wealthiest university, but it is short on cash.
 The school relies on its endowment to generate a third of the money for its operations, and the endowment is on the verge of posting its biggest loss in 40 years. With much of its money tied up for the long term, it is scrambling to meet some obligations. 
 Harvard has frozen salaries for faculty and nonunion staff members, and offered early retirement to 1,600 employees. The divinity school has warned it may not be able to cover tuition for all its students with need, the school of arts and sciences is cutting its billion-dollar budget roughly 10 percent, and the university president said this week than the unprecedented drop in the endowment was causing it to delay its planned expansion, starting with a $1 billion science center, into the Allston neighborhood of Boston.
 The school has even added to its debt by issuing $1.5 billion in new bonds, its largest such offering ever. 
 Turning the ship around turns heavily on Jane Mendillo, who took over the Harvard endowment on July 1 -- which in hindsight looks like the worst possible moment to step into a job once held by some legendary investors. The endowment, the largest of any university in the nation, has shrunk by at least $8 billion, to $29 billion, since she arrived.
 Undoubtedly, Ms. Mendillo inherited a complex portfolio, with many investments involving leveraged bets on equities and commodities that are difficult to unwind. Within days of her arrival, oil prices peaked and, with other commodities, began a precipitous fall. Stock prices commenced a sharp decline. Then came the cash calls on her portfolio.
 In an interview, she recalled the Sunday in September when she learned Lehman Brothers would file for bankruptcy -- a night she was celebrating her 50th birthday -- as the beginning of her 12-hour workdays. ''Clearly, that was a big turning point,'' she said, adding that her longer-term strategic goals were overrun by urgent needs, like raising cash. 
 ''There were some things that I knew were going to happen and be challenges,'' said Ms. Mendillo, who speaks softly, choosing her words carefully. ''There were others that I don't think anybody could have foreseen.''
 One she might not have anticipated was the intense pressure caused by the Allston expansion, according to one person with knowledge of the endowment. Several years ago, the university had envisioned an ambitious capital expansion program stretching for more than a decade. Lawrence H. Summers, then Harvard's president, had raised the possibility of locking in interest rates that appeared to be at historic lows, a plan the university adopted, said several people familiar with the endowment. 
 All went well at first. But in the second half of last year, interest rates plummeted, and Harvard turned to the endowment to meet hefty collateral calls, which could rise to $1 billion if rates remain weak, according to a person with knowledge of the university. According to a statement Friday from James R. Rothenberg, treasurer of the university, Harvard has taken a series of steps to reduce the risk associated with the transaction. 
 The endowment was squeezed partly because it had invested more than its assets, a leveraging strategy that can magnify results, both good and bad. It also had invested heavily in private equity and related deals, which not only lock up existing cash but require investors to put up more capital over time. 
 To free up cash, Ms. Mendillo has had to make some unpleasant choices, selling $1 billion in equities, including some in hedge funds with outstanding performances. A source familiar with the endowment identified Convexity Capital, run by one of her predecessors, Jack Meyer, as well as Baupost Group, led by Seth Klarman. Neither would comment for this article. Though she would not confirm relationships with specific managers, Ms. Mendillo said, ''We have taken money from a lot of funds as the size of the portfolio has changed.''
 She also sought to sell some of the endowment's large private equity positions, to little avail.
 Harvard, like other universities, has pushed into alternative investments, including private equity, which now constitute 13 percent of its total assets. In good times these investments return money as deals are completed. Now the returns have dried up, yet the commitments for new money remain, causing perhaps her greatest headache.
 ''The university needs cash, and we have investments that need capital,'' Ms. Mendillo said.
 She has raised the equivalent of 3 percent of assets for a cash reserve. ''For a long time, Harvard had a negative 5 position,'' she said. ''That means that 105 percent of the assets are invested at most times.'' 
 Her critics say that Ms. Mendillo's overall investment strategy is unclear and that while the crisis erupted faster and with more magnitude than could have been predicted, she could have moved more quickly to manage the risk. Supporters counter that her predecessors essentially left her hamstrung with a portfolio that was illiquid, and give her high marks on investing acumen.
 ''She does not beat you over the head with her knowledge, although it is clear that it is there,'' said Andrew K. Golden, who oversees the endowment at Princeton.
 Harvard has said its overall endowment portfolio declined 22 percent from July through October and that it could end the fiscal year in June down 30 percent. That performance is in line with the average for university endowments, though some have done better. Yale's endowment was off 13.4 percent in the comparable four-month period, while Princeton's was down 11 percent, and both have projected a total 25 percent drop for the fiscal year. 
 Like Harvard, many schools are responding by taking on more debt. Princeton sold $1 billion in bonds recently, its first taxable offering since 1994.
 Before landing on the hot seat, Ms. Mendillo ran the much smaller endowment of Wellesley College. But she honed her investing style earlier at Harvard. After graduating from Yale and its school of management, she was an equity analyst and a consultant. David Swensen, a friend who manages Yale's fund, advised her to work for Mr. Meyer if she wanted to learn portfolio management. She started covering steel and insurance industries, because ''that was what was left over'' and stayed 15 years.
 Mr. Meyer racked up a stellar record running the endowment, putting Harvard's returns second only to Yale's. But complaints about the size of managers' pay packages, relative to the academics' pay, ultimately prompted Mr. Meyer and many of his acolytes to leave in 2005.
 A period of relative instability ensued. Harvard hired Mohamed El-Erian, who stayed just two years before returning to a top post with Pacific Investment Management Company. Before and after Mr. El-Erian's stint, the endowment relied on board members as interim managers. 
 Though the Harvard endowment posted a strong 8.6 percent gain in the year before Ms. Mendillo arrived, David A. Salem, who heads the Investment Fund for Foundations, says he believes that Mr. El-Erian did the school a disservice by hiring people to implement certain strategies and then ''jumping ship.''
 Mr. El-Erian declined to comment for this article. 
 Mr. Salem, who knows Ms. Mendillo from the board of the investment fund, also said that Mr. El-Erian appeared to have left Harvard with an extremely illiquid portfolio, a situation complicated when a permanent replacement was not named for seven months after his departure.
 According to two people familiar with Harvard's strategy, the endowment had entered into swap agreements under which it paid short-term interest rates and received the returns on stock and commodities indexes. Those indexes declined sharply in the third quarter last year, and Harvard had to come up with collateral just as it was forced to meet other cash needs. 
 Though she has let go about 25 percent of her staff, or roughly 50 people, as the portfolio shrinks, Ms. Mendillo seems intent on keeping 30 percent of the assets under internal management.
 She is also trying to manage expectations.
 ''I am preparing the Harvard portfolio for the next one to three years for returns that will not be as attractive as what we expected on average,'' she said.

HEADLINE: City Ballet Cuts Corps As Deficit Widens

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
The ax has fallen at New York City Ballet, where the ballet master in chief, Peter Martins, has let go 11 members of the corps to help confront the same economic woes that have afflicted most performing arts institutions amid the recession. 
 Ticket sales and donations are both down about 6 percent to 8 percent, company officials said, causing a major shortfall in revenue. The company expects to record a $5.5 million deficit this season, even with extra cost-cutting measures, Kenneth Tabachnick, the general manager, said on Friday.
 Mr. Tabachnick called the $5.5 million deficit, on a budget of $62.3 million, ''extraordinary.'' He said the company had already planned for a $3.7 million deficit going into this season. 
 Other cost-cutting measures include 10 percent salary reductions for senior staff, a hiring freeze and cutbacks in marketing, communications, production, development and administration, he said. 
 ''We have, over the past several years, had an increasing level of deficit,'' Mr. Tabachnick said. ''This year with the economic environment around us, as you can imagine, like everybody else, it's even more pressing.''
 Opera companies, orchestras, concert presenters and dance troupes throughout America have been hard pressed by declines in ticket sales, donations and endowments this year. The financial pressures have led to salary cuts, layoffs, canceled performances and even a few collapses, like those of the Baltimore Opera and the Connecticut Opera.
 If the economy does not significantly worsen, the layoffs and cost-saving measures at New York City Ballet should mean a deficit of $2 million to $3 million next year, Mr. Tabachnick said. Junior staff members will have their salaries cut by 5 percent next season, Mr. Martins said. 
 Mr. Martins said he spent the whole day on Thursday telling the affected corps members individually that their contracts would not be renewed for next year. ''This is the hardest thing I've done my entire professional career,'' he said. He also said he included himself in the 10 percent pay cut.
 The cuts will bring the company's complement to 90 from 101 unless other dancers are added, although no decisions have been made, City Ballet officials said. The officials were quick to point out that the average number of dancers was 93 over the last 20 years.
 There were no plans to reduce the number of principals and soloists, and their salaries remain fixed by collective bargaining agreements, Mr. Martins said. He said the cutbacks would not reduce the quality, quantity or scope of performances on the stage of the David H. Koch Theater, the former New York State Theater, where City Ballet performs. 
 The cut in corps numbers came now because the deadline for renewing contracts is Feb. 28. 
 New York City Ballet said it would not release the names of the corps members whose contracts had not been renewed because the members have another five months of dancing to do until their contracts expire.
 City Ballet's endowment, reflecting the dismal results for many other nonprofit investment funds, is down to about $138 million from about $187 million. City Ballet said it decides how much it will draw down from the endowment at the beginning of the fiscal year, so the drop will be reflected next season.

HEADLINE: Bank Worries Keep Pulling Markets Back

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY; Chris Nicholson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The week on Wall Street started bad and only got worse, as worries about Eastern European banks gave way to fears that the United States would have to take over major financial institutions. By the end of trading on Friday, the Dow had tumbled 6.2 percent, its worst week since October.
 Signs of concern abounded: Gold prices briefly rose above $1,000 an ounce and Treasury prices rose as investors looked for safer investments. Most market sectors finished lower. Citigroup fell below $2 a share. 
 On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed back from a 200-point loss and other indexes partly recovered after the White House issued a statement assuring investors it supported a privately owned banking system.
 Even with its afternoon recovery, the Dow Jones industrial average declined 100.28 points, or 1.34 percent, to 7,365.67, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.89 points, or 1.14 percent, to 770.05. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 1.59 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,441.23.
 For the week, the Dow lost 485 points, to close at a six-year low. The S.& P. 500 fell 6.5 percent, but was still slightly above its bear-market lows of Nov. 20. 
 As the recession drags on and banking losses pile up, investors have been concerned that the administration could step in and take over some large banks, effectively wiping out stockholders, analysts said. Those concerns gripped markets on Friday after Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, told Bloomberg Television that a short-term nationalization might be necessary.
 Bank of America fell slightly, and Citigroup fell by 22 percent, to $1.95 a share, down 90 percent from its share price a year ago. Regional banks fell. Shares of the Ohio-based Fifth Third Bancorp, which has been granted more than $3 billion under the federal financial bailout, closed at $1.03. 
 ''All these banks are becoming insolvent,'' David Kovacs, chief investment officer of quantitative strategies at Turner Investment Partners, said of the broad banking system. ''These banks are undercapitalized.''
 Still, some analysts said the chatter about nationalization highlighted deepening investor pessimism.
 ''I think it is a cause du jour for taking down financial stocks,'' said Michael Holland, chairman of Holland & Company. ''When people see a reason for selling, they go ahead and sell some more.'' In another signal of growing investor fear, gold prices rose $25.70, to $1,001.80 an ounce, as investors ran for cover in a metal thought to have intrinsic value. Gold prices tumbled to near $700 an ounce last autumn as the economy slowed, but analysts say investors have bid up the precious metal as they worry about long-term inflation and huge government spending plans.
 Demand for United States. debt was strong as well. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 19/32, at 99 22/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.79 percent, down from 2.85 percent late Thursday.
 Crude oil prices in New York fell 54 cents, to settle at $38.94, up from $35 a barrel at the start of the week. Shares of energy companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Total closed lower.
 ''We thought the low points of last fall were behind us, but we seem to be in for more disappointments,'' said a strategist at ING Investment in Brussels, Vincent Juvyns. ''The markets have lost all sense of direction, which makes it hard to take a position.''
 Markets largely discounted a report from the Labor Department that consumer prices increased 0.3 percent in January, rising for the first time since July. Consumer prices remained flat year-over-year, a sign of continuing pressure on prices as the recession deepens.
 ''It's not terrible to see a break in the disinflationary spiral we're in even if such a break is only temporary,'' Dan Greenhaus, an analyst with the equity strategy group of Miller Tabak, wrote in a note.

HEADLINE: 'Buy America' in Stimulus (But Good Luck With That)

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The ''Buy America'' clause in the $787 billion stimulus package signed into law on Tuesday has a certain quaintness to it. Far more than in the past, the phrase has come to mean ''Buy America -- if it is still made here.'' 
 Take the $43 billion earmarked for green technology. Most of the nation's solar panels and wind turbines are imported, mainly from Europe and Asia, and the new law waves aside Buy America restrictions if ''the relevant manufactured goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities.''
 The provision will apply mainly to the nearly $150 billion that will be spent on infrastructure projects, including green technology. Supporters of the original measure hoped that all of the ''iron, steel and manufactured goods'' used in the various projects would be made in the United States. But the legislation signed by President Obama is full of exceptions that quiet even the fiercest critics of that original plan. 
 ''We are not happy with any Buy America provision, but we can live with this one,'' said Martin A. Regalia, chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce, which represents many multinational companies that have moved manufacturing offshore for products likely to be used to build or repair highways, bridges, schools, rapid-transit systems, waterways and homes. 
 Most of the support for a clause to protect American businesses came from small manufacturers, with operations concentrated in the United States. But even they no longer make much of the machinery and materials likely to be needed for a wave of investment. 
 Trade data tell the story. By late last year, 37 percent of all manufactured goods sold in America were imported. That was more than double the percentage in 1991, according to Commerce Department data, and nearly four times the level in 1978. Buy America had far more impact in the 1930s and in the early 1980s, two other periods in which Congress enacted similar measures with the goal of generating good jobs in manufacturing and lifting output. 
 ''The reality is that if we want to move ahead on shovel-ready infrastructure,'' we cannot limit ourselves to products made in the United States, said Scott N. Paul, executive director of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which represents small manufacturers. The alliance had pushed hard for stronger protections, and the measure that emerged is unlikely to shield its constituents from foreign imports. 
 The Buy America clause allows, for example, imports from the 38 countries with which the United States has trade agreements. Among the nation's major trading partners, only Brazil, India and China would be subject to the restriction. And what they ship to America would not be turned away if doing so ''would be inconsistent with the public interest,'' the law says.
 The components of green technology, an important target of federal spending, fall into this category. ''The president's goal is to double the output of renewable energy in three years,'' said George Sterzinger, executive director of the Renewable Energy Policy Project, financed by the federal government and private foundations. ''But right now we don't make enough solar panels and wind turbines in this country to do that.''
 Seventy percent of the 14,000 wind turbines in the United States were imported. That level of imports would continue, even under the new Buy America clause, if domestic manufacturers could not fill the orders. Importing many of these products will dilute the job creation and output increases that are the overall goals of the stimulus package, many economists say, just as job creation and output are diluted when people save tax rebates or spend them on imported goods and services. 
 ''The leakage is a real issue; we don't make enough stuff here,'' said Daniel R. DiMicco, chairman of Nucor, the big steel company. 
 The steel industry, not surprisingly, was a big supporter of the Buy America clause. Although some specialty steels needed for public works will still be imported, most of the steel orders generated by the federal stimulus package are expected to go to American mills, which are now operating at less than 50 percent of capacity. 
 While there may be excess capacity in steel, that is not the issue elsewhere in manufacturing. That is partly because American multinationals often use overseas factories, but also because American companies, whatever their size, simply do not make some of the key components of Mr. Obama's recovery proposals. 
 Take mass transit. The Obama stimulus would designate a chunk of money for the upgrading or expansion of mass transit systems, in part through the purchase of new subway and light rail cars. No American manufacturer makes these cars, although three foreign companies assemble them at plants in the United States, mainly from components manufactured abroad, according to Jonathan M. Feldman, an American economist at Stockholm University, whose research focuses on mass transit.
 ''The assembly operations represent only 10 percent of the total value added,'' Mr. Feldman said. ''The rest is embedded in the components, made overseas.'' 
 That cuts into the job creation promised by Mr. Obama, but even so Buy America is a worthy goal, says Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and a consultant to the Alliance for American Manufacturing. 
 ''We are behind other countries in solar and wind turbine technology,'' he said, ''and Buy America is an incentive for American companies to catch up. It is not just trade protection but a form of industrial policy.''
 No multinational was more outspoken in its opposition to the Buy America provision than Caterpillar, the manufacturer expected to provide thousands of the tractors, dump trucks and other heavy equipment that will be needed for the newly authorized infrastructure projects. Most are made at factories in the United States, but one high-riding dump truck with giant rubber tires and a snout-like cabin is made only at a Caterpillar plant in Peterlee, England. 
 John Deere produces a similar vehicle in the United States, at a plant in Davenport, Iowa. Still, waivers and exceptions built into the Buy America provision will allow Caterpillar to import the dump truck from England -- competing with Deere for stimulus spending -- and also to continue to sell them in China, which is involved in an even bigger stimulus package than the United States' plan, says William C. Lane, Caterpillar's director of government affairs in Washington. 
 ''The Buy America provision in the House was bad,'' Mr. Lane said. ''The Senate made it worse, and fortunately the conference bill watered it down. Now it is up to the Obama administration to issue regulations that do not delay infrastructure projects and don't encourage mirror legislation in other countries.''

HEADLINE: Financial Problems Close Sports Museum

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
The Sports Museum of America, which opened near Wall Street in May with high expectations and the sight of stars such as Eli Manning and Walt Frazier waving red foam fingers, shut down after business on Friday.
 ''The board of directors voted to cease operations last night,'' said Philip Schwalb, the 25,000-square-foot museum's founder and a board member, ''but I'm hoping it's not the end.'' 
 The $93 million, for-profit museum, at 26 Broadway, had exclusive relationships with more than 60 sports halls of fame and other organizations, and was home to the Heisman Trophy and the Billie Jean King International Women's Sports Center. 
 The museum suspended payments late last year on $57 million in tax-free Liberty Bonds, which were designed to assist an economic rebound in Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Another $36 million in private money was raised.
 The museum was on track to draw 125,000 visitors, well below preopening projections of one million. Schwalb said the museum could have survived with 275,000. Over the past year it cut its top ticket price from $27 to $16 and laid off employees.
 He insisted that the recession was far less a problem than a $6 million construction cost overrun that forced the museum to severely cut marketing. He said an ill-conceived ad campaign resulted in ''95 percent of residents of New York City never hearing of us.'' 
 Schwalb said that for the past six weeks, after efforts to restructure the bond debt failed, the board tried to sell the museum for $10 million, one-tenth of the total cost of the venture, including seed money that was invested earlier. 
 He said the deal now being offered potential buyers is an 85 percent stake in the museum, with the rest retained by the original equity investors. He said he would prefer that the old investors retain 25 percent. Schwalb was the original chief executive, but the board asked him to surrender the role last year.
 Unsuccessful acquisition talks were held, he said, with Magic Johnson Enterprises and a small group of the original investors. 
 ''I think we'll have to sell within about three weeks,'' said Schwalb. ''The concept is still strong and the subject matter is as compelling as the Museum of Arts and Design in Columbus Circle, and it's not in the middle of Times Square, either.'' The arts and design museum opened last September.
 David Warburg, the lead lawyer of the unsuccessful effort to restructure the museum's debt, said the museum will probably liquidate its assets and return memorabilia to their owners. He said that Schwalb ''never appeared with any investor that was concrete and, quite frankly, he didn't do much to advance things.''
 Schwalb's plan from its earliest conception was to create a Smithsonian-like museum of sports that would be more central to fans and tourists than individual sports halls of fame. 
 He believes the site, near the World Trade Center and where tourists head to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, is as viable as the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum at 12th Avenue and 46th Street, or the popular Bodies exhibition at the South Street Seaport. But the museum was hamstrung by not being in a stand-alone building; it is inside the old Standard Oil building and lacks the exterior signage that would define it as a major attraction.
 The museum's demise is likely to make the Heisman Trophy an orphan again. The Downtown Athletic Club, its longtime former home, shut its doors in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. A large gallery in the museum is devoted to the Heisman and its history.
 Bill Dockery, president of the Heisman Trophy Trust, said: ''We're disappointed and find it unfortunate that the traffic flow didn't allow the museum to continue as it was expected. A new buyer would be fine if they treat the Heisman with integrity. I know Philip had his heart in this, and I'm sure this is taking a lot out of him.''

HEADLINE: In the Tents, Most Faces Feature Model Pout

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
''Zoloft should send a comet into this place,'' said Elvis Nunez, a 32-year-old stylist who lives in Brooklyn, declared as he surveyed the main tent in the middle of Fashion Week on Wednesday night. ''So should Paxil. They should shower this place with pills. Serotonin levels are down.''
 At first it was hard to know what Mr. Nunez was talking about. The crowd looked pretty good: young women were tiptoeing about in high heels and even higher skirts, and men were sailing by in black outfits and natty suits. But regulars at the twice-yearly shows said that rather than providing escape, as they normally do, the bubblelike tents of Bryant Park were bubbles no more, and were invaded instead by a palpable grimness this year. 
 ''Everyone just seems to be really sad,'' said Mimi Ton, an editor of a New York-based fashion and design Web site, www.plaztikmag.com. 
 ''There are less guards, and less cute little girls in their cute outfits'' with their complaints ''you didn't need to hear,'' Ms. Ton said, referring to the clipboard-clutching publicists who oversee access to the shows. ''Even the guards seem a little down.''
 The economy being in shambles, it was natural to expect a toned-down Fashion Week this season, with fewer designers showing fewer outfits, fewer models on the catwalks and fewer lavish parties. But some were taken aback by just how somber the mood hanging over the crowds at Fashion Week was; several of the most devout fashionistas said that even they were thrown into a bit of an existential crisis.
 ''When you really stop to think about it, this is something you shouldn't be doing,'' said Marilyn Kirschner, a former senior editor at Harper's Bazaar and the editor in chief of lookonline.com. Ms. Kirschner said she always felt strange riding the subway to Fashion Week alongside people of all -- or no -- incomes, but never more so than this week. 
 ''You should be programming yourself to not buy anything,'' she said. ''But I don't know if I could do that. Years of programming have told me that I have to buy this platform boot because it's three-quarters of an inch different from last season's. No one else notices, except if you're in fashion. It's very sick.'' 
 Speaking just before the Richie Rich show in the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria, Justin Estill, a 24-year-old model (who was not part of the show) said he wondered whether the excesses of high fashion were necessary, given the economic crisis. 
 But several veterans said that far from being a frivolity, Fashion Week highlights an industry, however besieged, that is vital to the lifeblood and culture of New York. The city's Economic Development Corporation estimates that the industry employs 175,000 people and generates $10 billion in wages, $1.6 billion in tax revenue and $55 billion in sales each year; the shows themselves are estimated to draw 100,000 people and generate $466 million in visitor spending annually.
 Jasmine Snow, a fashion assistant at Seventeen magazine, noted that the winter shows were usually lower-key anyway. One stylist attributed the crowd's relative moroseness to the fact that fewer free bubbly cocktails were being passed around. ''It would be better if we had been given Champagne before noon,'' said the stylist, who did not want her name printed lest she come across as an alcoholic. 
 Even within the confines of the tents, where the liqueur company Chambord was serving free drinks and a Barbie display surrounded the center fountain, it was nearly impossible to forget the world's woes. To wit: a Wall Street fund manager who had been brought by a friend to Nanette Lepore's show on Wednesday morning, found himself unable to put down his BlackBerry, even though it was delivering a great deal of bad news. 
 ''Look at it -- it's all red, everything's red,'' said the fund manager, who spoke on the condition he not be named because he did not want to disclose that he was taking a break to attend fashion shows. As he thumbed through his e-mail, a sea of stock symbols stared back at him, and sure enough, all of them were red, indicating losses.
 ''Let it all go, forget it,'' urged his friend, a former model and freelance journalist. ''Just for 15 minutes.''
 ''I would like to relax,'' the fund manager conceded. He slipped his BlackBerry into the pocket of his cashmere coat, which happened to be missing a button, took a long breath, looked around, and began bouncing his leg up and down. The show began, with lanky, pouty models prancing by in tweed miniskirts and beribboned dresses, jewels gathered at their throats. 
 No sooner had the last model left the runway than the fund manager whipped his BlackBerry back out -- and groaned.
 ''I'm watching the whole thing melting down,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Despite Kyrgyz Vote to Close U.S. Base, Gates Explores Options to Keep It Open

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and ELLEN BARRY. 
Thom Shanker reported from Krakow, and Ellen Barry from Moscow.

DATELINE: KRAKOW, Poland 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Thursday that the United States might consider increasing payments to Kyrgyzstan for access to a crucial air base, just hours after the Kyrgyz Parliament voted to terminate the lease and require the Americans to vacate the base within six months.
 ''We have not resigned ourselves to this being the last word,'' Mr. Gates said at a meeting here of NATO defense ministers to discuss the need for more combat forces and reconstruction teams in Afghanistan. 
 The base, in Manas, plays a central role for NATO's Afghan mission. It provides transit facilities for thousands of personnel and 500 tons of cargo each month, and it is used by the tanker aircraft that refuel fighter planes on missions over Afghanistan. The Obama administration has called the war there a high priority, announcing this week that an additional 17,000 American troops would be sent in the coming months. The loss of the base is seen as a serious challenge. 
 Mr. Gates said the United States remained prepared to discuss with Kyrgyzstan whether larger fees were warranted for use of the base, but he cautioned, ''We are not going to be ridiculous about it.''
 ''Manas is important,'' he said, ''but it is not irreplaceable.''
 He said that American negotiators already were deep into discussions with ''a number of different countries,'' including Russia, about alternatives to the logistics hub in Kyrgyzstan.
 It remained unclear how quickly the United States would have to find an alternative. President Kurmanbek Bakiyev of Kyrgyzstan was expected to send Washington an official notice, but American officials said they still did not know when it would be received or when the six-month countdown would start. Mr. Bakiyev signed the legislation on Friday.
 The bill in Parliament was approved by 78 of the 81 lawmakers present, with two voting against it and one abstaining. 
 The Kyrgyz government in Bishkek had longstanding complaints about the base and had asked for more cash compensation. Tensions were exacerbated in 2006 when an American serviceman fatally shot a Kyrgyz truck driver. 
 Mr. Bakiyev announced the move to close the base at a news conference with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, who this month promised to shore up Kyrgyzstan's struggling economy with about $2.15 billion in loans and grants. Moscow has long complained about the continued American military presence in Central Asia, and many in Washington concluded that Russia had encouraged the move in an attempt to assert its dominance in the region.
 Although Russian and Kyrgyz officials say there was no connection between the Kremlin's financial aid and efforts to kick out the Americans, senior American officials have complained that the Russians are trying to have it both ways -- with the Kremlin expressing a desire to support the international military mission in Afghanistan while pressing the Kyrgyz government to end American access to its air base.
 In public comments as part of the vote, Kyrgyz lawmakers portrayed the action as the culmination of years of complaints and said the American presence in Central Asia had outlasted its usefulness. 
 ''It is impossible to make people of Afghanistan live by standards which are brought in from abroad,'' said Kabai Karabhekov, a member of Parliament. ''One has to give an opportunity to Afghan people to build their country themselves.''
 The shadow of Russian actions in Central Asia and Central Europe fell over the session of NATO ministers here, as Mr. Gates also was pressed on whether the Obama administration intended to move forward with a plan for missile defenses in Europe that had been a priority of the Bush administration's foreign policy and that had brought threats of military retaliation from Russia.
 Mr. Gates, in his first overseas trip since he began serving the new president, said the missile defense bases planned in Poland and the Czech Republic would proceed if the technology proved it could work and was affordable.
 Neither of those two caveats were part of the Bush administration's language when discussing requirements for the bases.
 But Mr. Gates also made it clear that the Obama administration had not yet met on the issue of missile defense policy, and that no decisions had been made on how to proceed.
 ''The administration has not yet reviewed where it is on a whole range of issues,'' Mr. Gates said, including the missile defense program and how to manage that within the relationship with Russia.
 Mr. Gates said the radar proposed for the Czech Republic and the 10 interceptor missiles for Poland were to counter a potential threat from Iran, and he reiterated that the United States would work with NATO and wanted Russia as a partner in the effort.
 To reassure his hosts here, Mr. Gates said that a series of new bilateral military cooperation efforts with Poland were proceeding even as the prospects for the missile defense site on Polish territory remained uncertain.
 Also Thursday, NATO officials confirmed that Germany had pledged 600 more soldiers to the mission in Afghanistan.
 ''We welcome the commitment of additional German forces for the upcoming Afghan national elections,'' said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary. ''For those contests to be credible, voter turnout must be robust and representative, and improving the security situation is the key to making that happen.''
 Italy announced this week that it would add 500 troops to the alliance mission in Afghanistan by April.

HEADLINE: Netanyahu to Form New Israel Government

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER; Ethan Bronner reported from Jerusalem, and Alan Cowell contributed from Paris.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the conservative Likud Party, was invited by Israel's president, Shimon Peres, on Friday to take the lead in assembling the next government. Whatever form that government takes, Mr. Netanyahu, 59, is widely expected to return as prime minister a decade after the last government he led fell apart.
 In a brief but statesmanlike speech at the presidential residence on Friday afternoon, Mr. Netanyahu accepted the mandate and immediately called on the centrist Kadima Party, led by Tzipi Livni, and the center-left Labor Party, led by Ehud Barak, to join him in a unity government. He said national unity was necessary in order for Israel to contend with the formidable challenges ahead. 
 ''Let us unite to secure the future of the State of Israel,'' Mr. Netanyahu said, adding that he wanted to discuss the possibility of forming a broad government ''for the good of the people and the state.''
 Mr. Netanyahu and Ms. Livni have agreed to meet on Sunday, but the negotiations between them are likely to be tough and the chances of success are unclear.
 Ms. Livni, the current foreign minister and Mr. Netanyahu's main rival for the premiership, has so far refused the idea of joining a government led by Mr. Netanyahu and including several ultra-orthodox and far-right parties. Committed to the peace process with the Palestinians, she has said she would rather go into the opposition than serve as a fig-leaf for a coalition of the right.
 Mr. Barak, whose Labor Party fared badly in the elections, has already said he would heed the will of the people and head into the opposition. 
 But in his plea for unity, Mr. Netanyahu pointed to the existential threat to Israel that would be posed by a nuclear Iran and the global economic crisis that he said could cost hundreds of thousands of Israelis their jobs. 
 Such major challenges, Mr. Netanyahu said, required ''a new approach'' of unity and of ''joining hands.'' Striking a more positive and conciliatory tone, he said the goal was to seek ''peace with our neighbors and unity among ourselves.'' 
 A broad government joined by the center and left would likely promote a more pragmatic agenda and avoid friction with Israel's most important ally, the United States. 
 Mr. Netanyahu will have up to six weeks to put together a governing coalition. He was tapped for the premiership after he gained the endorsement of 65 members of the 120-seat Parliament, from religious parties and those on the far right. 
 While Ms. Livni's Kadima narrowly won the Feb. 10 elections, it failed to muster the support of a majority in the Parliament, a prerequisite for forming a governing coalition. Ms. Livni gained the endorsement only of Kadima's 28 legislators. 
 In the last few days, many here have predicted that Mr. Netanyahu would be left with no choice but to form a narrow government with those he has termed his ''natural partners,'' parties representing the ultra-orthodox and the right. 
 After a private meeting earlier Friday with Mr. Peres, who has also been urging national unity, Ms. Livni said that the coalition taking shape lacked political vision and that ''a broad coalition has no value if it does not lead the way.''
 But in his speech on Friday, Mr. Netanyahu indicated that he wanted to embark on a new track. He said he would meet first with Ms. Livni and Mr. Barak, and made no mention of the parties that endorsed him -- groups like Avigdor Lieberman's ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu, which came third in the elections, or the ultra-orthodox Shas.
 Rina Mazliah, a political commentator with Israel's Channel 2 News, said that Mr. Netanyahu had changed direction and that his call for unity based on national responsibility might make it difficult for Ms. Livni to refuse.
 Nevertheless, Mr. Netanyahu's vision of unity seemed far from assured. 
 Leading members of Mr. Barak's once-dominant Labor Party, which won a mere 13 seats in the new Parliament, have said the party must spend time rebuilding itself in the opposition. 
 Moreover, the parties to any coalition would have to agree on basic government guidelines. 
 Ms. Livni has staked her political career on promoting negotiations with the more pragmatic, Western-backed Palestinian leadership for a two-state solution. Mr. Netanyahu says he wants to promote ''economic peace'' in the West Bank but has remained deliberately vague about any long-term political solutions. 
 Ms. Livni noted on Thursday that Mr. Netanyahu ''meanwhile refuses to talk about a two-state solution.''
 Mr. Netanyahu acknowledged on Friday that there were serious political differences, but he said that given the momentousness of the hour he believed it was possible to ''find a common path to reach the country's goals.'' 
 A narrow government would be less stable, with Mr. Netanyahu having to balance the often competing demands of small parties. A right-wing agenda would also set Israel on a possible collision course with the new administration in the United States, which has pledged an active and aggressive pursuit of peace. 
 Shalom Yerushalmi, a columnist in Friday's Maariv newspaper, described such a government as Mr. Netanyahu's ''nightmare.''
 ''The narrow government he formed in 1996 fell apart in stages,'' Mr. Yerushalmi noted. ''Netanyahu swore that he would not make a narrow government again, and would never again be the prime minister of half the people.''

HEADLINE: 'Project Runway' Battle Dampens Fashion Week

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
Each season on ''Project Runway,'' a buzzword seems to emerge from the fashion ether. In Season 4 the word was ''fierce,'' courtesy of the winner, Christian Siriano. This season ''bummer'' may be the operative word. 
 The sixth season of the hit cable television show is in production without a parent network or a premiere date, because of dueling lawsuits by NBC Universal and the Weinstein Company. 
 Although Season 6 won't be broadcast for months, if ever, the producers filmed an awkward finale at Fashion Week in New York on Friday, in a tented room filled with barely hushed uncertainty about the show's future. 
 ''We are all in a bit of a limbo,'' the show's host, the model Heidi Klum, told the roughly 1,000 audience members, ''and we hope that everything is sorted out very soon.'' 
 The ''Runway'' finales are normally a highlight of Fashion Week, which is held at Bryant Park in Manhattan twice a year. But the lawsuits cast a pall over the competition on Friday. 
 ''For the contestants, it's kind of horrible,'' Mr. Siriano said before the show. 
 In previous seasons the first episodes of ''Runway'' had been broadcast by the time the three finalists presented at Fashion Week, enabling the audience at Bryant Park to root for their favorite contestants and handicap the results of the final competition. 
 But on Friday the ''Runway'' producers went to great lengths to conceal the identities of the finalists, lest future viewers feel that the show is spoiled by leaks. The finalists weren't allowed to walk onstage and present their fashion collections publicly; instead the collections were shown anonymously. 
 ''I'm a little bit sad for our designers, that they don't get that recognition today,'' Ms. Klum said. The introductions of the finalists were taped in advance. 
 In addition, all 16 contestants were expected to be backstage, making it more difficult for models or makeup artists to spot the finalists. Unlike in past years, reporters were prohibited from going into the area. 
 ''I feel really bad'' for the contestants, one audience member said as the lights were dimmed. ''What a bummer,'' a woman seated in the first row added. 
 Jane Cha, an executive producer, said the sixth season -- the first to be filmed in Los Angeles, after five seasons in New York -- was mostly unaffected by the legal dispute, save for the finale. In a telephone interview, she said the finalists were more worried about ''the nuts and bolts of the collection'' than about the lawsuits. 
 The producers finished filming the Los Angeles portion of the competition in October. ''We'll hold it in the can until all this gets sorted out,'' Ms. Cha said.
 She added that it was frustrating, but that ''I think we've all kind of accepted the situation.'' 
 The legal wrangling started last April when, after five seasons on NBC Universal's Bravo channel, the producers at the Weinstein Company sold the rights to the series to another cable channel, Lifetime. That sale prompted a breach-of-contract suit by NBC and a countersuit by the Weinstein Company. 
 Almost six months ago a New York state judge issued an injunction that prevented Lifetime from promoting or broadcasting ''Runway'' for the time being; Lifetime will appeal that decision in court on March 19. The two companies, meanwhile, are awaiting a trial date. 
 Neither company would comment on the pending suits. In a statement, Lifetime said that it continues ''to look forward to this entire matter being resolved expeditiously'' and that it remains hopeful that the show will appear on the channel. 
 Speaking to the crowd on Friday, Tim Gunn, a designer who coaches the contestants on ''Project Runway,'' said he wished he could introduce the finalists: ''We have a smashing, sensational season for you. We can't wait for you to see it.'' 
 Nina Garcia, one of the ''Runway'' judges, said in an interview that she was ''very hopeful'' the program would eventually be shown. 
 ''The show is about supporting young designers,'' she said. ''It's about supporting the business of fashion. It's not a reality show for the sake of having a reality show.'' And amid a gloomy economic backdrop, she added, ''Runway'' is ''very needed right now in the industry.'' 
 ''Runway,'' which in 2007 became the first reality show to win a Peabody Award, has in previous years been the top-rated show on Bravo. 
 After New York Fashion Week, the producers normally start work on the next season. But for now they are holding off. As for the contestants, they will return to their normal lives, albeit under a strict confidentiality contract that bars them from talking about the show.
 Mr. Siriano, for one, sounded confident that viewers wanted ''Runway'' to return. ''The audience is still out there,'' he said. 
 But he also sounded aware that television shows don't remain fashionable forever. 
 When a reporter asked whether viewers would still be waiting a year from now, he said, ''It might be a little bit over by then.''

HEADLINE: Obama Tells Mayors to Spend Wisely

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama told the nation's mayors on Friday that he would hold them accountable for how they spend the money in his $787 billion economic stimulus package, which he described as ''a true partnership'' between the federal government and cities that have been too long neglected by Washington.
 ''I want to be clear about this: We cannot tolerate business as usual -- not in Washington, not in our state capitols, not in America's cities and towns,'' Mr. Obama told a gathering of the United States Conference of Mayors. He said he was putting them ''on notice'' that if they propose a wasteful project, ''I will call them out on it.'' 
 The mayors, who also spoke with Cabinet secretaries during their visit to the White House, came with a variety of projects in mind for the money: community health centers, new water towers, sewage treatment plants. They said afterward that their main concern about the money was that it would be bottled up in state government. Even some Republican mayors who had been uneasy about the stimulus package said they were happy to have the money.
 ''Now that the bill has passed, I want it to work the best way it can,'' said Patrick McCrory, a Republican and the mayor of Charlotte, N.C., who said he had concerns about the package before it passed. 
 Kevin Burns, a Democrat and the mayor of North Miami, Fla., said: ''Whether we like it or not, this money is here; we have to account for it, we have to spend it. The time for bickering that it's a bad program is over with.''
 In his remarks to the mayors, Mr. Obama further distanced himself from his predecessor, George W. Bush, whom he accused sharply, though not by name, of paying too little attention to urban problems. He also sought to defuse frequent Republican assertions that the Democrats' idea of solving problems is to toss taxpayers' money at them, heedless of where it lands. 
 Alluding to the astronomical sums in the stimulus program, President Obama said, ''What is required in return, what I will need from all of you, is unprecedented responsibility and accountability -- on all of our parts. The American people are watching.''
 The president repeated his pledge that, under scrutiny byhis team of money managers and in public view through the Web site www.recovery.gov, the money flowing out of Washington would be spent ''wisely, free from politics and free from personal agendas'' -- a goal that skeptics have said will be hard to meet.
 The stimulus package, whose details are outlined in a document as thick as several metropolitan telephone books, will direct money at health care, transportation, education, energy efficiency and other areas in an effort to ''turn this crisis into opportunity and bring our cities into the future,'' Mr. Obama said.
 ''If a federal agency proposes a project that will waste that money, I will not hesitate to call them out on it, and put a stop to it,'' the president said, emphasizing that state and local governments would be held to the same standard.
 Acknowledging that the mayors of, say, Newark, N.J., and Tulsa, Okla., may have starkly different ideas about governing and very different constituencies, the president said that they still would have something in common: ''You're on the front lines in our communities. You know what happens when folks get laid off or they lose their homes or their health care, and they turn to the mayor's office for help.''
 Mr. Obama drew applause when he praised the cities' chief executives for tackling systemic problems on their own, and then he flung a dart at Congressional Republicans, almost none of whom supported the stimulus package: ''You shouldn't have to succeed, though, despite Washington,'' he told the mayors. ''You should be succeeding with a hand from Washington. And that's what you're going to get now.''
 Mr. Obama was introduced by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who told the mayors, ''We want you to know you can have our phone number, and you know where we live.''
 While President Obama did not appear to gloat, he may have taken satisfaction in alluding to his days as a community organizer, a period in his life that Republicans tried to exploit during the presidential campaign as representing the extent of his executive experience.
 ''Whenever I have the opportunity to meet with mayors, I think about how I got my start doing what you do each day, working with folks at the local level and doing our best to make a real impact on the lives of ordinary Americans,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Albany, Don't Bank on the Feds

 BODY:
The big federal stimulus package offers only momentary relief to states like New York with looming deficits. Even though California's sleep-deprived lawmakers finally passed a recession-era budget this week to deal with an enormous deficit, budget gaps will continue to grow unless drastic changes are made in the way most states spend their money.
 California's budget imposes new taxes, slashes state services and asks almost every Californian to give up something. Now, it's every New Yorker's turn. 
 Over the next month, Gov. David Paterson and the New York State Legislature will have to agree on a $120 billion budget that reorders spending on health care, education and employee benefits. Mr. Paterson's budget proposals last year projected a $13 billion deficit for the 2009-2010 fiscal year. That was bleak enough, but since then the economy has grown steadily worse.
 The federal stimulus package will help some; New York will receive at least $24 billion over two years. But without reforms, cuts in services and new fees, the state will still suffer big deficits this year and in the future. 
 For too many in Albany, that sounds like tomorrow's problem. Special-interest lobbyists have only intensified their efforts to fight this year's cuts. Their campaign includes the usual overdrawn television ads, warning of disaster if the governor has his way. Those groups argue that such pain is not necessary if Albany enacts a new ''millionaire's income tax'' on anyone making more than $250,000 a year.
 Mr. Paterson must, of course, protect the basics -- students, patients, police and firefighters, as well as bridges, roads and commuter rails. And if higher income taxes become necessary, he should make sure they are temporary and merely a prelude to a broader revision of New York's tax structure to make it fairer and more dependable. But over all, he must stick to his guns and fight entrenched forces and make the cuts and reforms necessary to put the state on a firm financial footing now and in the future.
 Perhaps the toughest part of that fight will be pushing for Medicaid reforms that would curb reimbursements for most hospitals, nursing homes and home care and encourage more cost-effective care. As part of that drive, the governor should continue efforts to expand community clinics so that people without health insurance will not be forced into emergency rooms for expensive routine treatments. 
 On education, he and the legislators should make certain that more money flows to students in need. Old formulas -- with every district getting its traditional share of whatever money is available -- may be easier politically. But this downturn offers the opportunity to shift funds from powerful and richer suburbs to less-fortunate urban and rural areas.
 As the economic picture worsens, lawmakers, unions and Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City should also seek a reasonable way to cut back government pension plans for new employees. Many of these plans are unusually generous compared with private companies' pensions, and the cost to the state is going up far too quickly each year.
 Mr. Paterson should also continue his efforts to expand the bottle redemption bill and find secure revenues for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. He should not give up on his tax on sodas -- a good idea that has drawn a lot of unnecessary criticism.
 Finally, Mr. Paterson should keep repeating this to his old Albany pals: Washington's bailout is a patch on New York's troubles, not a fix.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Governor Seeks Increase in Gas Tax

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Massachusetts would have the nation's highest gasoline tax under a plan that Gov. Deval Patrick proposed Friday to reduce the mountainous debt from the Big Dig and other projects. 
 Mr. Patrick, a Democrat, said he wanted to raise the state gas tax by 19 cents, to 42.5 cents a gallon, to deliver almost $500 million a year in badly needed revenue that otherwise would have to come from raising highway tolls. 
 Massachusetts has not increased its gas tax since 1991, but it is among several states that may do so this year, given the scope of the economic crisis. The legislature has to approve Mr. Patrick's plan.
 New York now has the nation's highest gas tax, 41.3 cents a gallon, followed by California, at 35.3 cents. In all states, drivers also pay a federal tax of 18.4 cents a gallon.
 Mr. Patrick said that without new revenue, the state's transportation system would face a deficit of up to $19 billion over the next 20 years. That is partly due to the Big Dig, a tunnel system that replaced an elevated highway through downtown Boston.

HEADLINE: Critique of Housing Plan Draws Quick White House Offensive

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The White House signaled its concern on Friday about a populist backlash against President Obama's housing plan, taking the offensive against a cable television reporter whose critique of the plan sparked a new debate about assisting homeowners in danger of foreclosure.
 Mr. Obama's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, used his daily televised briefing to deliver a calculated attack against the reporter, Rick Santelli of CNBC, whose criticism reflected a broader concern that taxpayers were being asked to rescue people who had been financially irresponsible. Mentioning Mr. Santelli repeatedly by name, Mr. Gibbs declared flatly that the reporter, a former derivatives trader, ''doesn't know what he's talking about.'' 
 The administration says the plan, which could cost taxpayers as much as $275 billion, will help as many as nine million homeowners avert foreclosure, including many who are not delinquent on their mortgages. On Thursday, speaking from the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Mr. Santelli said the plan rewarded ''bad behavior'' and called for the creation of a Web site where Americans could vote on whether they ''really want to subsidize the losers' mortgages.''
 By Friday morning, the Santelli critique was dominating the talk shows and spreading rapidly on the Internet. Mr. Gibbs hit back hard after consulting with the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, and Mr. Obama's senior adviser, David Axelrod, a senior administration official said.
 ''I'm not entirely sure where Mr. Santelli lives, or in what house he lives,'' Mr. Gibbs began, jabbing at the reporter for his former career. ''I think we left a few months ago the adage that if it was good for a derivatives trader that it was good for Main Street.''
 Mr. Gibbs went on to say that ''Mr. Santelli has argued, I think quite wrongly, that this plan won't help everyone,'' adding, ''I would encourage him to read the president's plan and understand that it will help millions of people, many of whom he knows. I'd be more than happy to have him come here and read it. I'd be happy to buy him a cup of coffee -- decaf.''
 In a sense, Mr. Santelli's critique turned the tables on Mr. Obama; the president himself has been trying to tap into populist anger by declaring Wall Street bonuses ''shameful.'' When he announced his housing plan in Phoenix on Wednesday, Mr. Obama said pointedly that it would not help ''speculators who took risky bets'' or ''dishonest lenders who acted irresponsibly'' or ''folks who bought homes they knew from the beginning they would never be able to afford.''
 Mr. Santelli's attack was a reminder to the White House that the mounting costs of the bailouts carry a political risk. If the bailouts are seen as primarily helping groups like bankers and people who got themselves into trouble by making bad financial decisions -- rather than helping the overall economy and trying to stem the loss of jobs -- it could make it more difficult for the administration to go back to Congress for more money and to maintain support for the president's agenda.
 Mr. Santelli, for his part, said on CBNC on Friday that he was pleased Mr. Gibbs had paid so much attention to his critique.
 ''I think it's terrific that this has been opened up to national debate,'' he said. ''I think it's wonderful that he invited me to the White House. I'm not really big on decaf though; I think I prefer tea.''

HEADLINE: With New Name and Mission, the Infamous Abu Ghraib Prison Is to Reopen

BYLINE: By SAM DAGHER

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
The Iraqi government has renamed and partly renovated the infamous Abu Ghraib prison on the outskirts of Baghdad, and it plans to transfer about 3,000 convicts there shortly, the first to occupy the facility in any numbers since it was handed over by the Americans in 2006. 
 The government says it sorely needs Abu Ghraib -- now Baghdad Central Prison -- and other detention centers around the country being refurbished with American money because of overcrowding at prisons and continued threats to security, said Safaa el-Deen al-Safi, who was the acting justice minister for almost two years, until Thursday. 
 A former judge, Dara Noureddin, who was imprisoned in Abu Ghraib in 2002, was named the new justice minister. Mr. Noureddin, a Kurd, was freed in October of that year after Saddam Hussein emptied the prison ahead of the American invasion. Although Abu Ghraib was notorious under Mr. Hussein's government as a place for torture and executions, it may forever be defined around the world by the images made public in 2004 of Iraqi detainees being abused and sexually humiliated by American soldiers and interrogators. 
 Some of the victims, who are now suing the American contractors that supplied interrogators and translators to Abu Ghraib when it was under American control, are opposed to its reopening as a prison and want instead to turn it into a museum to immortalize Iraqis' suffering. Others say it should simply be razed.
 But the Iraqi government is determined to operate it as a prison. ''It's not so easy for us to waste a state resource,'' said Mr. Safi, who is also minister of state for parliamentary affairs and a confidant of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. ''Yes, this prison has a bad reputation, but this is not an excuse in itself to demolish this prison, given that we need it.''
 Mr. Safi said that renaming Abu Ghraib as the Baghdad Central Prison and changing its mission to rehabilitation would help remove some of the stigma.
 Mr. Safi said that he personally oversaw the renovation of the cellblocks where the worst of the abuses were committed by American soldiers and contractors, and that the prison now had classrooms, a library, plots of land for gardening and hothouse farming, and workshops where inmates would be taught sewing, hairdressing and computer skills. 
 Abu Ghraib, designed by an American architect, Edmund Whiting, and built by British contractors in the late 1960s, occupies a site of nearly 280 acres about 15 miles west of Baghdad. 
 Mr. Safi spoke with pride about the Iraqi government's ability to complete the limited renovation of Abu Ghraib for about $1 million, as opposed to the millions of dollars being spent by American government agencies on similar projects around the country.
 Reading from a document on his desk, Mr. Safi listed American-financed prison renovations and projects in Basra, the Kurdistan region, Nasiriya and Ramadi at a total cost of about $100 million.
 Mr. Safi said there were about 17,000 inmates in prisons under the administration of the Ministry of Justice, adding that this figure did not include those being held by the Ministry of Interior and other security organs of the government. 
 The American military is holding about 14,500 inmates as what it calls ''security detainees.'' Mr. Safi said their cases were being examined in batches of 1,500 for release or referral to Iraq's judicial system, as called for in the security agreement signed between Baghdad and Washington in the fall. 
 Mr. Safi estimated that 5,000 of those in American custody would ultimately be convicted in Iraqi courts and sent to prison. That influx, in light of the already overcrowded Iraqi prison system, makes reopening Abu Ghraib all the more pressing, Mr. Safi said.
 But the reopening is stirring unease among many Iraqis, who associate the prison not only with American abuses but also with a long history of government brutality and repression. 
 In a report issued in December that underscored those concerns, Human Rights Watch warned that long pretrial detentions and the prevalence of abuse in Iraqi prisons -- including the coercion of confessions and arrests made based on testimony by secret informants -- ''show disturbing continuity'' with the abuses of Mr. Hussein's era.
 Hassan al-Azzawi, who spent seven months in the prison in 2004 when it was under American control, said the reopening showed the government's lack of commitment to reconciliation, or perhaps betrayed an intention to stuff the prison with its opponents. 
 Mr. Azzawi, 50, is among more than 300 former inmates suing two American contractors, CACI International and the Titan Corporation, for torture and abuse in American courts. The companies supplied the military with interrogators and translators. 
 Another plaintiff, who wished to be identified only by his first name, Asaad, because his case is pending, described in detail the tactics used by the interrogation teams.
 He said he was made to stand for hours under a freezing cold shower until he collapsed. He was then dragged to the cellblock's hallway, where he said he had to crawl naked on the hard floor as he was punched by guards and threatened with rape. Asaad, 36, said he was once shackled to his bed for more than a day.
 ''I am an average citizen, I have no say, but it is better to turn it into a museum,'' Asaad said. ''Horrible things happened in Abu Ghraib.''
 Balkis Sharara cringes when she recalls how her husband, Rifat Chadirji, one of Iraq's most prominent architects, was incarcerated there 30 years ago after being sentenced to life in prison for ''economic sabotage'' and ''grand treason'' after declining to work on a government-financed project.
 ''These were the darkest days of our lives,'' she said by telephone from the couple's home in Lebanon. 
 Mr. Chadirji, now 83, recalled hearing torture sessions nearly every night, and the execution in one day of 180 fellow inmates in the cellblock for political detainees. He was pardoned in late 1981 by Mr. Hussein, and the couple left Iraq for good the next year.

HEADLINE: Netanyahu, Pick to Lead Israel, Calls for a Centrist Government

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER; Isabel Kershner contributed reporting.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
Benjamin Netanyahu, the Likud Party leader chosen Friday to form Israel's next government, likes to tell a story about his meeting last summer in Jerusalem with President Obama, who was then still the Democratic candidate. 
 As it was ending Mr. Obama pulled Mr. Netanyahu aside from their aides to a corner of the room in the King David Hotel.
 ''You and I have a lot in common,'' Mr. Obama said, according to Mr. Netanyahu's account. ''I started on the left and moved to the center. You started on the right and moved to the center. We are both pragmatists who like to get things done.'' 
 Whether that turns out to be an accurate assessment will determine much of what happens in the American-Israeli relationship in the next couple of years and in efforts to make progress on Middle East peace. 
 But what is almost as noteworthy is that Mr. Netanyahu tells the story with pride and a kind of endorsement. Although he is a hawkish man of the right and runs the largest conservative party in Israel, he considers himself a pragmatist. 
 He has long said that he hoped to form a centrist governing coalition and he restated that ambition on Friday, calling on the centrist Kadima Party, led by Tzipi Livni, and the center-left Labor Party, led by Ehud Barak, to join him in a unity government. Mr. Netanyahu and Ms. Livni have agreed to meet Sunday, but the negotiations are likely to be tough. Ms. Livni, his chief rival for the premiership, has said she would rather go into opposition than serve as a fig leaf for a coalition of the right.
 Mr. Barak, whose Labor Party fared badly in the elections, has already said he would head into the opposition. 
 To many here, it is increasingly likely that Mr. Netanyahu's government will consist exclusively of parties from the right, which oppose a Palestinian state and favor expanding Israeli settlements in the West Bank, making it much harder for him to exercise his pragmatic penchant.
 Mr. Netanyahu, 59, who earned a bachelor's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and speaks flawless English, is no newcomer to Israeli politics or to claims of pragmatism. Raised in Jerusalem and in a suburb of Philadelphia, where his father was a history professor, he served in an elite Israeli military unit under Mr. Barak, the current defense minister. The author of several books, he has a daughter from a first wife and two sons with his current wife, Sara.
 He was ambassador to the United Nations while still in his 30s and has held numerous ministerial posts. He was prime minister between 1996 and 1999, and although he opposed the 1993 Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, he then met with the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and forged an agreement with him to share the volatile West Bank city of Hebron.
 That led ultimately to new elections (the Israeli right abandoned him) and victory for Mr. Barak. 
 Mr. Netanyahu remains a deep skeptic about the Muslim world's intentions toward Israel and tends to highlight fears more than hopes for the region. He opposed Israel's withdrawal in 2005 from Gaza, saying it would lead to Hamas rockets on Israel, which it did. Like other dark predictions of his, that has led Israelis to see him as a reliable guide to the region. 
 Today, he says stopping Iran from going nuclear is a much more important issue than whether a Palestinian state is established. He has made clear that the Iranian challenge is an existential one that could well lead to military action.
 He believes that if Iran's ambition for regional hegemony is checked and its nuclear program stopped, then its clients, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, will be of less concern. 
 Mr. Netanyahu does not plan to end negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, although he wants to refocus them on building the Palestinian economy and its institutions in the West Bank rather than on signing a comprehensive deal. The Palestinian leadership has openly disdained that approach. 
 Still, many of the steps that the departing prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and the Palestinians have agreed to regarding economic development have stalled, and Mr. Netanyahu believes his ability to cut through bureaucratic red tape could make a difference. He has told the former British prime minister, Tony Blair, who is the international representative to the Palestinians, that he could more quickly build industrial zones, cut back on checkpoints and generally improve life in the West Bank.
 Whether he would be willing to remove Israeli settlements, however, or give up enough territory to satisfy the Palestinians remain open questions, as does whether he could return the Golan Heights to Syria in exchange for a peace accord. He has said no a number of times, and again last week, arguing for Golan's strategic value. 
 But when he was prime minister a decade ago he explored the issue through an American intermediary. The Israeli election campaign in recent weeks tilted rightward after the war in Gaza, so he may have been campaigning rather than revealing his true intentions. Those on the left who dislike Mr. Netanyahu say they hope he is as personally ambitious as they suspect and that pressure from Washington will produce results.
 ''I don't think he has much compunction in sacrificing an ideological position as long as it keeps him in power,'' said Yaron Ezrahi, a liberal political scientist at Hebrew University. ''We either need a prime minister who is ideologically committed to a two-state solution and has the power to move the country in that direction, or a very flexible opportunist who appears committed to the right but acts according to what is necessary.''
 But Mr. Netanyahu's associates and fellow Likud activists say that he remains committed to core principles and that his flexibility reflects a change in his party's position.
 ''Likud as a party has made a major transformation in the last 15 years from being rigidly committed to retaining all the land of Israel to looking pragmatically at how to retain for Israel defensible borders in a very uncertain Middle East,'' said Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and a close associate.
 For Mr. Netanyahu, that has meant accepting that much of the West Bank will be part of a future Palestinian state, but with Israel keeping control of the borders, airspace and electromagnetic frequencies. The state would also have no military, by his reckoning. 
 Whether such a deal would ever be acceptable to the Palestinians is far from clear. Equally unclear is whether the government he forms will allow him the freedom of action to go even that far.

HEADLINE: Reshaping Diplomacy By Tossing The Script

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
On Friday morning, Hillary Rodham Clinton was the picture of a stern superpower diplomat, warning North Korea not to test a long-range ballistic missile. A few hours later, she was asked by a giggly Korean student how she knew she had fallen in love with her husband.
 ''I feel more like an advice columnist than a secretary of state,'' Mrs. Clinton said with a smile. 
 Henry Kissinger, this isn't.
 On each stop of her Asian tour, Mrs. Clinton is redefining the job of secretary of state, fusing the weighty themes of regional security and nuclear proliferation with lighter encounters in which Mrs. Clinton is quizzed about her musical tastes or asked what it was like to raise her daughter.
 She is also redefining herself to some extent. After going to Beijing in 1995 as first lady to deliver an impassioned speech on women's rights, Mrs. Clinton has sidelined human rights on this trip, saying she does not want the topic to interfere with central issues like climate change or the economic crisis.
 In Indonesia on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton appeared on a popular variety show, ''Awesome,'' on which she told the young host, somewhat sheepishly, that her favorite musicians were the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. She politely declined to sing, saying it would empty the room.
 None of this is especially new to Americans. But it is novel to people outside the United States, who expect foreign ministers to stick to a diplomatic script.
 As she neared the end of her maiden voyage as secretary of state with a two-day visit to Beijing, Mrs. Clinton said she was determined to make a connection to people ''in a way that is not traditional, not confined by the ministerial greeting and the staged handshake photo.''
 ''I see our job right now, given where we are in the world and what we've inherited, as repairing relations, not only with governments but with people,'' she said to reporters on Friday.
 To do that, Mrs. Clinton is exploiting both her megawatt celebrity and her training during the presidential campaign. On Friday, nearly 3,000 female students packed an auditorium at Ewha Womans University in Seoul to hear Mrs. Clinton deliver a speech that ranged from North Korea's nuclear threat to the challenge women face in balancing work and family.
 A standing-room-only crowd at the University of Tokyo listened to Mrs. Clinton discuss how the United States should rebuild its ties to the Muslim world. Toward the end, a nervous young woman, who said she played on a baseball team, asked Mrs. Clinton how to become as strong as she was. 
 ''Well, I played a lot of baseball, and I played with a lot of boys,'' she replied, to peals of laughter.
 Mrs. Clinton said she was skeptical that these appearances alone would lead to changes in the policies of foreign governments. But by connecting with people on a personal level, she said, she believes she can help mold public opinion, which, in turn, can influence governments.
 ''President Obama has an extraordinary capacity to do that because of the really positive feelings that he personally engenders,'' she said. ''To a lesser degree, I have some of the same capacity.''
 In a working-class area of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, a small crowd trailed Mrs. Clinton as she toured health and water-treatment projects financed by the United States Agency for International Development.
 ''People are very excited to see Hillary Clinton,'' said Daniel Sitorus, 24, a lawyer in the neighborhood. ''It doesn't matter that she isn't Barack Obama; she is one of the most famous women in the world.''
 She is not just beguiling audiences. During her visit to Seoul, Mrs. Clinton raised eyebrows among journalists and analysts with a frank assessment of how a succession struggle in North Korea could undermine talks over its nuclear program. She said she was baffled by the reaction.
 ''I don't think that it's a forbidden subject to talk about succession in the hermit kingdom,'' she said.
 ''Maybe this is unusual because you are supposed to be so careful that we spend hours avoiding stating the obvious,'' Mrs. Clinton continued. ''I think it's worth, perhaps, being more straightforward, trying to engage other countries on the basis of the reality that exists.''
 That said, Mrs. Clinton did reaffirm Friday that the United States would conduct negotiations with the government of Kim Jong-il ''now, and for as long as he is the man calling the shots.''
 And in a news conference with South Korea's foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, she used time-tested diplomatic language in warning North Korea to stop its belligerence toward South Korea. ''North Korea,'' she said, ''is not going to get a different relationship with the United States while insulting and refusing dialogue with the Republic of Korea.''
 Mrs. Clinton, however, evinces little patience for running through talking points. In Beijing, for example, she said she would raise familiar issues with Chinese officials like human rights in Tibet, while she expected them to complain about American arms sales to Taiwan.
 ''We know what they're going to say, because I've had those conversations for more than a decade with Chinese leaders,'' said Mrs. Clinton, who first visited Beijing in 1995 for her speech on women's rights and has written about how she made her Chinese hosts uncomfortable.
 This time, however, she said human rights concerns should not derail discussions on big issues like the global economic crisis, climate change and North Korea. That has earned her sharp criticism from Amnesty International, which said Friday that it was ''shocked and extremely disappointed'' that human rights were not made more of a priority.
 For all of her innovations, Mrs. Clinton's schedule in Beijing on Saturday looks like that of any other secretary of state: meetings with President Hu Jintao, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and other senior officials. 
 On Sunday, before she flies home, she plans to attend church services, a small gesture to religious freedom in a Communist society. But she said she did not want to make a big deal of it. ''I'm going to be there on Sunday morning, and I thought I would go to church,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Balancing Needles and Cigars

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III. 
E-mail: pursuits@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SOMEHOW I always knew my executive pursuits would end with me lying face down on a massage table at Sage Hampton Spa in Wainscott, N.Y., naked except for a towel around my waist, perforated from head to toe by two dozen fine filiform Chinese acupuncture needles, splayed out like a road-killed porcupine beneath the winter moon.
 I just never imagined it would all turn on a point called ''Stomach 36.''
 Mikal Gohring, 59, a veteran acupuncturist with wire-rimmed glasses and a ponytail protruding from an otherwise shaved head, leaned across the massage table, brandishing yet another needle over my left shin. 
 ''Breathe in, and then exhale,'' he urged in a soothing whisper.
 I did as instructed, hoping for bliss. Mikal had told me that his prescribed respiratory routine would distract my mind from the impending puncture and align my yin better with my yang. But when he jabbed that 25th needle into my shin, my whole body seemed to go into spasm.
 ''Ouch!'' I cried out. ''That really hurts!''
 ''It's Stomach 36,'' Mikal replied. ''It's one of the famous points in acupuncture that influences the functions of your internal organs.''
 I shuddered, second-guessing my sanity and my reasons for seeking acupuncture treatment. My ostensible motivation was to quit smoking cigars. Along with the obvious health considerations, there were new financial urgencies. The price of my brand of small cigars had soared to $15 a pack. I was going through at least five packs a week. I simply could not afford it much longer.
 ''Acupuncture won't make you quit smoking,'' Mikal reminded me. ''The only way to stop is just to stop. But there's an aspect of your being that will realize his time may be limited, and he will rebel. Acupuncture will help you deal with what comes up.''
 Moments later, Mikal turned on a DVD of Gregorian chants, dimmed the lights and left me alone to allow the treatment to take effect.
 The rebellious aspect of my being, heretofore known to me as my evil twin, Larry, immediately reared his needled head. My first executive pursuit, back in May 2005, reported on a renaissance in cigar smoking prompted by the then-booming economy. Feeling a fellowship with the likes of Sigmund Freud, Arnold Schwarzenegger and James E. Cayne, then the chairman of Bear Stearns, I had proposed four rules of cigar etiquette intended to counteract the antismoking police.
 Now we had come full circle, and Larry was totally depressed. Arnold had morphed from a Republican governor of California into a de facto Democrat. Jimmy Cayne had suffered an ignominious fall. There was no such thing as Bear Stearns anymore, no such thing as a Wall Street investment bank, for that matter. Having once gorged on the kind of tobacco-wrapped stimulus packages that Dr. Freud favored, we now had to settle for a series of half-baked Washington bailout plans.
 If Larry disdained the idea of quitting cigars, he believed that turning to acupuncture was downright kooky. I begged to differ. According to a 2002 survey by the National Institutes of Health, more than eight million people in the United States have tried acupuncture. It is legal in 40 states, and there are more than 11,000 licensed acupuncturists nationwide, plus another 3,000 medical doctors who practice the art. 
 Classified as a part of traditional Chinese medicine dating back more than 3,000 years, acupuncture is based on the principle of achieving health by balancing yin and yang, or opposing forces. Two crucial concepts are the qi (pronounced ''chee''), often described as the flow of ''vital energy,'' and the blood, variously described as both a liquid and a metaphorical flow. The goal is to regulate the qi and the blood by alleviating blockages, draining excesses and refilling shortages.
 This spiritually charged plumbing operation relies on inserting needles into a patient's skin along 14 pathways known as ''meridians'' that wind across the body. The meridians purportedly correspond to specified internal organs like the lung, the heart, the pericardium, the spleen, the liver and the kidney. But as I discovered in the case of my shins and ''Stomach 36,'' the insertion points and the corresponding organs do not necessarily occupy the same physical locations.
 While many leading Western medical authorities remain skeptical about acupuncture, scores of patients have extolled its apparent effectiveness in treating low back pain, headaches, sciatica, dysentery, nausea and vomiting and certain forms of addiction. One of those satisfied souls referred me to Mikal Gohring, insisting that he could surely help me quit cigars.
 Born in New York City, Mikal is a former modern dance student whose career aspirations were terminated by injury. But he always had a passion for the healing arts. Trained in my own native Texas, he has been practicing acupuncture for 25 years. At Sage Hampton Spa, he charged $225 for an initial appointment and $125 per follow-up visit.
 Mikal worked on Larry and me for about six hours during four acupuncture sessions spread over three weeks. In keeping with traditional Chinese medicine diagnostic protocols, he began by examining my tongue. He found it to be swollen, pale and scallop-coated, indicating, he told me, a ''deficiency in my spleen with dampness accumulating'' and a deficiency in my pericardium. He took my pulse for a good five minutes, concluding that I had many blockages in the flows of qi and blood.
 ''All addictions are tied to some deep lack in the inner self tracing back to childhood,'' Mikal informed me. ''By taking substances like tobacco, you're trying to fill in that emptiness. We're going to fill it in with healthy things.''
 Mikal plied me with herb capsules branded ''Tobac Off'' and ''Jitters Away'' and a bottle of drops labeled ''Addiction Detox.'' In addition to perforating my meridians and the ''Stomach 36'' points on my shins, he pinned the tragus of my left ear, a location that was supposed to be specific to treating tobacco addiction.
 By the time Mikal returned to the massage table room at the end of our fourth session, Larry wanted to jump out of my skin and bolt to the nearest cigar bar. I didn't blame him. Every pore ached or tingled. My tragus felt as if it had been pounded with a jackhammer. 
 Mikal clearly sensed my agony as he removed the acupuncture needles. ''If using acupuncture to quit cigars doesn't work for you in the present moment, don't stress on it,'' he said. ''But do know that your relationship to the habit of smoking cigars will be forever changed.''
 I paid Mikal and went straight home to bed. I slept for the next 12 hours. When I finally mustered the energy to arise, Larry insisted on jamming a lighted cigar between my lips. I smoked it, then a second and a third. They tasted as good as they ever did.
 ''So much for coming full circle,'' Larry said, sneering. ''You're never going to stop smoking cigars.''
 I had to concede that my evil twin might be right. He knew me much too well. After all, we had come a long way together from Chateau Bow Wow, a k a the Doghouse, to divorce court; from getting a custom suit in Chinatown to donning a clown suit in the circus; from the cockpit of a World War II vintage fighter plane to the kitchen of a four-star French restaurant; from football fields, ballet barres and whitewater kayaking rivers to darkened pool halls and the front door of the Four Seasons Hotel on Inauguration Day.
 But even if I don't quit cigars, my bosses say I have to quitmy executive pursuits with this column, the 98th consecutive installment. So I leave you, dear readers, with two words that my late momma taught Larry and me never to forget to say -- thank you.

HEADLINE: At Amateur Team Events, It's All Fun and No Profits

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

 BODY:
Most chess tournaments with large cash prizes are organized into sections of players of similar ability, which makes the competitions fairer and easier to run. The drawback is that people who simply like to play in tournaments, and who are not focused on winning money, have few chances to compete against players who have different levels of skill. 
The exceptions are open tournaments where everyone is thrown into one pool. The biggest open tournaments are the United States Open, which is held every summer, and the Amateur Team Championships, which are held over the Washington's Birthday weekend.
There are four Amateur Team Championships in the United States. Each team in competition has four players, and the team's average rating must be below 2,200, the rank of a master. Although there are no cash prizes, many players, even grandmasters, say the events are among their favorites because of their collegiality.
In the team tournaments, it is possible to compete against people from a variety of backgrounds. In one round, a team might face a group of retired Navy veterans from Virginia, and in the next, junior high school students from the Bronx.
The tournaments encourage playfulness. There are awards for best costumes and best team names. Names this year included Madoff With Your Pieces; President Obama: Check Please; We're From Illinois and We Paid to Be Here; and I Can See Russians From My Board (voted best name at the Amateur Team East Tournament, the oldest and biggest).
Steve Doyle, an executive with the Aetna insurance company, has directed the East tournament for years. He said there were 283 teams this year, down slightly from the record of 291 in 2008. He attributed the decrease to the weak economy.
The East was won by the Sarah Palin Gambit: I Can See Checkmate From My Window, which defeated You Are Outrated: Give Up in the final round. A key to the victory was the game between Libardo Rueda of the Sarah Palin Gambit and Ian David Schoch of You Are Overrated. Rueda used the King's Indian Attack, a favorite of Bobby Fischer's. The idea is that White tries to hold the center while shifting his pieces, particularly his knights, toward Black's king in preparation for an all-out assault.
Black's best chance to counter is to play d4, which Schoch could have done on moves 13 and 15.
Rueda got a bit overeager with 17 f4. After 19 Bf4, the game could have continued 19 ... Bf4 20 Re8 Qe8 21 Bd5 Kh8 22 gf4 h6 23 Qf3 Bb7, and White's awkwardly placed pieces give Black adequate compensation for his pawn deficit.
Schoch blundered with 30 ... Kh7, but his position would have been quite difficult even after 30 ... Nf8.

HEADLINE: When Consumers Cut Back: An Object Lesson From Japan

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- As recession-wary Americans adapt to a new frugality, Japan offers a peek at how thrift can take lasting hold of a consumer society, to disastrous effect.
The economic malaise that plagued Japan from the 1990s until the early 2000s brought stunted wages and depressed stock prices, turning free-spending consumers into misers and making them dead weight on Japan's economy.
Today, years after the recovery, even well-off Japanese households use old bath water to do laundry, a popular way to save on utility bills. Sales of whiskey, the favorite drink among moneyed Tokyoites in the booming '80s, have fallen to a fifth of their peak. And the nation is losing interest in cars; sales have fallen by half since 1990.
The Takigasaki family in the Tokyo neighborhood of Nakano goes further to save a yen or two. Although the family has a comfortable nest egg, Hiroko Takigasaki carefully rations her vegetables. When she goes through too many in a given week, she reverts to her cost-saving standby: cabbage stew. 
''You can make almost anything with some cabbage, and perhaps some potato,'' says Mrs. Takigasaki, 49, who works part time at a home for people with disabilities.
Her husband has a well-paying job with the electronics giant Fujitsu, but ''I don't know when the ax will drop,'' she says. ''Really, we need to save much, much more.''
Japan eventually pulled itself out of the Lost Decade of the 1990s, thanks in part to a boom in exports to the United States and China. But even as the economy expanded, shell-shocked consumers refused to spend. Between 2001 and 2007, per-capita consumer spending rose only 0.2 percent.
Now, as exports dry up amid a worldwide collapse in demand, Japan's economy is in free-fall because it cannot rely on domestic consumption to pick up the slack.
In the last three months of 2008, Japan's economy shrank at an annualized rate of 12.7 percent, the sharpest decline since the oil shocks of the 1970s.
''Japan is so dependent on exports that when overseas markets slow down, Japan's economy teeters on collapse,'' said Hideo Kumano, an economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. ''On the surface, Japan looked like it had recovered from its Lost Decade of the 1990s. But Japan in fact entered a second Lost Decade -- that of lost consumption.''
The Japanese have had some good reasons to scale back spending.
Perhaps most important, the average worker's paycheck has shrunk in recent years, even after companies rebounded and bolstered their profits.
That discrepancy is the result of aggressive cost-cutting on the part of Japanese exporters like Toyota and Sony. They, like American companies now, have sought to fend off cutthroat competition from companies in emerging economies like South Korea and Taiwan, where labor costs are low.
To better compete, companies slashed jobs and wages, replacing much of their work force with temporary workers who had no job security and fewer benefits. Nontraditional workers now make up more than a third of Japan's labor force.
Younger people are feeling the brunt of that shift. Some 48 percent of workers age 24 or younger are temps. These workers, who came of age during a tough job market, tend to shun conspicuous consumption.
They tend to be uninterested in cars; a survey last year by the business daily Nikkei found that only 25 percent of Japanese men in their 20s wanted a car, down from 48 percent in 2000, contributing to the slump in sales.
Young Japanese women even seem to be losing their once- insatiable thirst for foreign fashion. Louis Vuitton, for example, reported a 10 percent drop in its sales in Japan in 2008.
''I'm not interested in big spending,'' says Risa Masaki, 20, a college student in Tokyo and a neighbor of the Takigasakis. ''I just want a humble life.''
Japan's aging population is not helping consumption. Businesses had hoped that baby boomers -- the generation that reaped the benefits of Japan's postwar breakneck economic growth -- would splurge their lifetime savings upon retirement, which began en masse in 2007. But that has not happened at the scale that companies had hoped.
Economists blame this slow spending on widespread distrust of Japan's pension system, which is buckling under the weight of one of the world's most rapidly aging societies. That could serve as a warning for the United States, where workers' 401(k)'s have been ravaged by declining stocks, pensions are disappearing, and the long-term solvency of the Social Security system is in question.
''My husband is retiring in five years, and I'm very concerned,'' says Ms. Masaki's mother, Naoko, 52. She says it is no relief that her husband, a public servant, can expect a hefty retirement package; pension payments could fall, and she has two unmarried children to worry about.
''I want him to find another job, and work as long as he's able,'' Mrs. Masaki says. ''We must be ready to fend for ourselves.''
Economic stimulus programs like the one President Obama signed into law last week have been hampered in Japan by deflation, the downward spiral of prices and wages that occurs when consumers hold down spending -- in part because they expect goods to be cheaper in the future.
Economists say deflation could interfere with the two trillion yen ($21 billion) in cash handouts that the Japanese government is planning, because consumers might save the extra money on the hunch that it will be more valuable in the future than it is now.
The same fear grips many economists and policymakers in the United States. ''Deflation is a real risk facing the economy,'' President Obama's chief economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, told reporters this month.
Hiromi Kobayashi, 38, a Tokyo homemaker, has taken to sewing children's ballet clothes at home to supplement income from her husband's job at a movie distribution company. The family has not gone on vacation in two years and still watches a cathode-ray tube TV. Mrs. Kobayashi has her eye on a flat-panel TV but is holding off.
''I'm going to find a bargain, then wait until it gets even cheaper,'' she says.
Correction: March 8, 2009, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Feb. 22 about the austerity of Japanese consumers, a legacy of the economic malaise that plagued Japan from the 1990s until the early 2000s, referred incorrectly to a residential area known as Nakano, the home of one frugal Japanese family whose members talked about their lives. It is part of the city of Tokyo, not a suburb. The article also misspelled, in some editions, part of the name of a research group whose economist, Hideo Kumano, said Japan's economy may once again be entering a prolonged malaise. It is Dai-ichi Life Research Institute (not Dai-chi).

HEADLINE: Trapped in Their Own Homes

BYLINE: By MARY JO PATTERSON

 BODY:
ON May 1, 2007, a very different economic era, Janet Faello put her former marital home on the market for $829,000. She and her husband were divorcing.
It seemed like a good price for the house, a six-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath ranch in Dix Hills, in Suffolk County on Long Island. But it didn't sell at that price, or at $750,000, where it landed six months later, or at $699,000, where it stands now.
''It's not the Taj Mahal, but it's a nice, well-maintained home,'' said Ms. Faello, a 53-year-old massage therapist with two daughters in college who remains in the house, which she and her ex-husband still jointly own. Her ex-husband lives elsewhere. ''I haven't been entertained once with an offer, and I'm still not getting any bites.''
With the house unsold, Ms. Faello said she and her ex-husband are struggling to meet expenses. Taxes alone are $13,860 a year. 
''I'm not ashamed to say to you, I have had to borrow money from my father,'' she said. ''We each want to move on. We're just hoping and praying things will turn around.''
Would-be sellers in New York City's suburbs understand her pain, whether they are trying to sell a Cape Cod for $300,000 or a center hall Colonial for $1 million. In a housing market characterized by eroding home values, high inventory and tight credit for borrowers, many feel stuck in a place they don't want or can't afford. As the recession becomes more severe and unemployment mounts, they fret each week their properties remain unsold, and fear losing equity. While buyers hunt for exceptional values, sellers feel like hostages. And their pain is sometimes drawn out when deals that seem to be done blow up just before the closing.
''I have an offer and we've accepted it,'' said Ray Lopez of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., a manager for Metro-North Railroad who has been trying to sell his house since last March. Last year he signed a contract, but learned two weeks before the closing that the buyer could not get a mortgage. While he hopes the current deal will go through, he said he won't relax until three weeks after the closing. ''Anything could happen,'' he said. ''You don't know till you have the check in your hand.''
All real estate is local, as brokers like to say, and comparable sales information is most useful within a smaller neighborhood, because prices vary so much even within one community.
Nevertheless, all the reporting agencies are concluding that the number of sales of single-family homes in 2008 was down from 2007 in the New York metropolitan area, and prices in general were down. The median price for a home sold in the metropolitan area was $458,600 in the fourth quarter of 2008, down 11.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Those figures reflect the agency's tracking of sales in Bergen, Hudson and Passaic Counties in New Jersey; and the Bronx, Kings, Putnam and Westchester Counties in New York.
In Connecticut, the median price of a single-family home sold in 2008 was $268,000, down from $295,000 the year before, according to the Warren Group.
The number of pending home sales in the Northeast, meanwhile, decreased 14.5 percent from December 2007 to December 2008, according to the National Association of Realtors. And some experts are warning that the housing market may not hit rock bottom for at least another year.
A seller's anguish may not be as sharp as the pain of a homeowner facing foreclosure. But the situation can alter life plans and jettison hopes.
Some sellers are losing hope.
Consider Mary Beth Lang of Shelton. She is 62, with grown children and a husband who retired as a buyer for a technology company. Her dream went like this: sell the house and move to their new custom home in Kentucky.
Her five-bedroom, four-bath house went on the market for more than $1 million in 2006. The price has since slid to $875,000, but there are no takers. Repainted, with many personal effects removed to look less cluttered, it no longer feels like home. The Kentucky house? It's for sale, too.
''Sometimes dreams just blow away,'' Ms. Lang said. ''Everything is incredibly depressing. Of course, there are people with sadder stories.''
Conventional wisdom holds that well-priced, attractive and aggressively marketed homes will sell. Now that is not necessarily true, said Cynthia Lippolis, principal broker with River Towns GMAC Real Estate in Croton-on-Hudson. ''I have some good listings that are priced very well and attractive, yet they are sitting there,'' she said. ''The economy is holding everyone back.''
James Bednar, a real estate agent representing buyers at DRI Real Estate Company in Ridgewood, N.J., said many sellers overvalue their homes.
''The industry has nailed into people's minds that their houses are worth a certain amount,'' said Mr. Bednar, who blogs about the New Jersey market at njrereport.com. ''Sellers remember what neighbors sold their houses for two years ago and hold on to those unrealistic comparables. They need to accept the current reality of the market.''
Mr. Bednar said he knows that sellers do not always have the leeway to drop their price. Others will be asked to pay a steep price for features buyers consider undesirable.
''In a boom time, buyers tend to overlook things like a high tension line that's a little close to the house, a street that's a little too busy or an odd layout,'' Mr. Bednar said. ''In a down market like this, those preferences are magnified.''
JONATHAN GREENBERG paid $792,000 for a lake house in Montville, N.J., in 2005, attracted by its unusual architecture and striking views. Then he invested nearly $100,000 in improvements. At the time he was single, but is now married and a father. With its steep slopes and 30-foot drop to the lake, the property is not ''kid-friendly,'' said Mr. Greenberg, who sells investment properties for a living. He listed the house a year ago for $930,000. The price is now $670,000.
''People say they love it, but it doesn't have some of the fundamentals families are looking for,'' said Mr. Greenberg, 41, whose wife, Malu, is expecting a second child. ''It'd be perfect for New Yorkers who need some kind of getaway. It's stressful. We do feel stuck.''
Some sellers manage to find equilibrium in limbo.
Pamela and Daniel Greenhall of Aberdeen Township, N.J., have been trying to sell their ranch-style home since May, when they learned they were expecting a third child. Their house, priced at $279,900, has three bedrooms and one bath. Mrs. Greenhall, 33, a school counselor, and her husband, 33, a carpenter, bought the house for $235,000 in 2004 and took out a loan for renovations. ''If it sold, we wouldn't stand to make a dime,'' she said.
Last month Mrs. Greenhall prepared for the new baby by converting one child's bedroom into a nursery and doubling the children up in the other.
''We're blessed in that we can still afford it,'' said Mrs. Greenhall, who delivered a boy on Feb. 3. ''We're comfortable. Is it a little cramped? Yes. Am I being overtaken by toys? Yes. But that's O.K.''
Margaret and Matt Brown, teachers in Westchester, took a similar approach. Last spring, when Mrs. Brown, 38, was pregnant with their second child, they listed their two-bedroom home in White Plains for $519,000. Within a month they reduced the price to $499,000.
As the baby's birth approached, the couple took the house off the market. Just then a buyer offered $475,000, but the couple rejected the offer.
''Now it's $465,000,'' said Mrs. Brown, a little ruefully, referring to the current asking price.
The new baby arrived last June, and in January the house was put back on the market. On the Feb. 7-8 weekend the Browns staged an open house themselves, after listing their home on Craigslist, placing advertisements in two newspapers and sending e-mail messages to everyone they know.
Twenty-three people showed up. Mrs. Brown said that 11 knew about the open house from a sign outside; 6 spied the listing on Craigslist; 4 were referred by friends; and one saw a newspaper advertisement. (One declined to talk.)
In the meantime, the Browns made an offer on a bigger house conditioned on the sale of their house. The owners accepted it, but are leaving the country and anxious to sell.
''That puts a little pressure on us,'' Mrs. Brown said. After the open house she paid to list the house with an online multiple listing service.
People who move into a new place before selling their old one feel even more stressed. Take Patrick Sweeney, 43, a father of three from Rowayton, who put his home on the market after he and his wife agreed to divorce and moved into separate homes. Mr. Sweeney is a builder who constructed the six-bedroom, six-bath house himself.
The house went on the market last month for $1,995,000, $300,000 less than Mr. Sweeney had banked on. There were no offers. He was surprised.
''The thinking was always, 'It will sell in a heartbeat,' '' Mr. Sweeney said.
He is worried now, and he plans to drop the price this spring. ''This can't go on forever,'' he said. ''It's got to go. We're paying to keep the heat on.''
In spite of the months without a buyer, Ms. Faello of Dix Hills is still optimistic that her house will sell, if she can just find the right approach.

HEADLINE: Drought Adds To Hardships In California

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: MENDOTA, Calif. 

 BODY:
The country's biggest agricultural engine, California's sprawling Central Valley, is being battered by the recession like farmland most everywhere. But in an unlucky strike of nature, the downturn is being deepened by a severe drought that threatens to drive up joblessness, increase food prices and cripple farms and towns.
 Across the valley, towns are already seeing some of the worst unemployment in the country, with rates three and four times the national average, as well as reported increases in all manner of social ills: drug use, excessive drinking and rises in hunger and domestic violence.
 With fewer checks to cash, even check-cashing businesses have failed, as have thrift stores, ice cream parlors and hardware shops. The state has put the 2008 drought losses at more than $300 million, and economists predict that this year's losses could swell past $2 billion, with as many as 80,000 jobs lost. 
 ''People are saying, 'Are you a third world country?' '' said Robert Silva, the mayor of Mendota, which has a 35 percent unemployment rate, up from the more typical seasonal average of about 20 percent. ''My community is dying on the vine.''
 Even as rains have washed across some of the state this month, greening some arid rangeland, agriculture officials say the lack of rain and the prospect of minimal state and federal water supplies have already led many farmers to fallow fields and retreat into survival mode with low-maintenance and low-labor crops.
 Last year, during the second year of the drought, more than 100,000 acres of the 4.7 million in the valley were left unplanted, and experts predict that number could soar to nearly 850,000 acres this year. 
 All of which could mean shorter supplies and higher prices in produce aisles -- California is the nation's biggest producer of tomatoes, almonds, avocados, grapes, artichokes, onions, lettuce, olives and dozens of other crops -- and increased desperation for people like Agustin Martinez, a 20-year veteran of the fields who generally makes $8 an hour picking fruit and pruning. 
 ''If I don't have work, I don't live,'' said Mr. Martinez, a 39-year-old father of three who was waiting in a food line in Selma, southeast of Fresno. ''And all the work is gone.''
 In Mendota, the self-described cantaloupe center of the world, a walk through town reveals young men in cowboy hats loitering, awaiting the vans that take workers to the fields. None arrive. 
 The city's main drag has a few quiet businesses -- a boxing gym, a liquor store -- and tellingly, two busy pool halls. The owner of one hall, Joseph R. Riofrio, said that his family had also long owned a grocery and check-cashing business in town, but that he had just converted to renting movies, figuring that people would rather stay at home in hard times. 
 ''We're not going to give up,'' Mr. Riofrio said. ''But people are doing bad.''
 Just down the highway in Firebaugh, Jose A. Ramirez, the city manager, said a half-dozen businesses in its commercial core had closed, decimating the tax base and leaving him to ''tell the Little League they'd have to paint their own lines'' on the local diamond.
 The situation is particularly acute in towns along the valley's western side, where farmers learned on Friday that federal officials anticipate a ''zero allocation'' of water from the Central Valley Project, the huge New Deal system of canals and reservoirs that irrigates three million acres of farmland. If the estimate holds and springtime remains dry, it would be first time ever that farmers faced a season-long cutoff from federal waters. 
 ''Farmers are very resilient, we make things happen, but we've never had a zero allocation,'' said Stephen Patricio, president of Westside Produce, a melon handler and harvester. ''And I might not be very good at math, but zero means zero.'' 
 While California has suffered severe dry spells before, including a three-year stint ending in 1977 and a five-year drought in the late '80s and early '90s, the ill effects now are compounded by the recession and other factors. 
 Federal, state and local officials paint a grim picture of a system taxed as it has never been before by a growing population, environmental concerns and a labyrinth of water supply contracts and agreements, some dating to the early 20th century. In addition to the federal water supplies, farmers can irrigate with water provided by the state authorities, drawn from wells and bought or transferred from other farmers. Such water may not always be the best quality, said Mark Borba, a fourth-generation farmer in Huron, Calif.
 ''But it's wet,'' he said. 
 Richard Howitt, the chairman of the agricultural and resource economics department at the University of California, Davis, estimates that 60,000 to 80,000 jobs could be lost -- including in ancillary businesses -- and that as much as $2.2 billion in crop and other losses could be caused by restrictions on water and the drought, which he called ''hydrologically as bad as 1977 and economically as bad as 1991.''
 ''You're talking about field workers, processing handlers, people packing melons, trucking hay, sprayers, people selling tractors, people selling lunches to people selling tractors,'' Mr. Howitt said. ''And in some of these small west-side towns, it's going to hit the people who are least able to adapt to it.'' 
 One of the hardest hit areas is the farmland served by the Westlands Water District, which receives water exclusively from the Central Valley Project and distributes it to 600,000 acres in Fresno and Kings Counties. Sarah Woolf, a spokeswoman for the district, said that her 700 members expected to leave 300,000 to 400,000 acres fallow and that some might not come back to farm at all.
 ''Everyone's trying to go down fighting,'' Ms. Woolf said. ''But there will be significant companies that will go out of business, as well as families that have been farming for generations, if it doesn't get better.'' 
 The outlook for things getting better quickly is dim, despite forecasts of rain this week. Last month, California officials estimated the snowpack in the Sierra, a primary source of water for the state when it melts in the spring, at 61 percent of normal. On Friday, the State Department of Water Resources said it would deliver just 15 percent of its promised contracts, a level it was able to maintain only because of the recent spate of rain. ''It's pathetic,'' said Lester A. Snow, the department's director. 
 Lynette Wirth, a spokeswoman for the United States Bureau of Reclamation, said water levels in all federally managed reservoirs in California were well below normal, with ''abysmal'' carryover from the previous year. 
 ''There's been no meaningful precipitation since last March,'' Ms. Wirth said.
 Farmers, of course, are also dealing with issues unrelated to rain, including tight credit from banks and recent court decisions meant to protect fish that have limited the transfer of water through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which feeds snowmelt to farmbound canals. Many farmers refer to a ''man-made drought'' caused by restrictions. 
 At the same time, environmental groups say they also fear a range of potential problems, including depletion of the valley aquifer from well pumping, possible dust-bowl conditions in areas of large patches of fallow ground and concern about salmon and other species. ''It's a tough year for the environment, and people,'' said Doug Obegi, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council.

HEADLINE: The Dangers Of 'Cap and Trade'

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WHENEVER I pull up to my neighborhood service station in Rancho Mirage, Calif., or anywhere else lately, I have a strange feeling. Because gasoline is so incredibly cheaper than it was just eight months ago, I almost feel as if I am getting something free.
 I keep wondering when someone in government will award some kind of stimulus prize to the oil companies for that. After all, by cutting the price of gasoline and other fuels by roughly half, the oil companies are giving consumers hundreds of billions of dollars in new purchasing power for other goods and services. Isn't that worthy of praise? 
 What's that, you say? It isn't the oil companies? It's just the free market correcting itself after a huge oil price bubble last year? Well, I agree. But I have a lot of angry e-mail burned into my brain from readers insisting that those high prices were an oil-company conspiracy.
 So, are the lower prices now a conspiracy to help the consumer? If that's silly -- and it is -- then let's go back to the free-market explanation. It might actually work. The free market can make us crazy, but it can also explain a lot. 
 Still, when I go to my local gas station, I am amazed that there is any gasoline there at all. Yes, I can see how the big oil companies happily made gasoline when oil was $140 a barrel. But how can they do it when oil is in the $30s? That takes some fancy planning.
 How do the oil companies manage to keep going when the price of their basic source product changes so much? Again, that takes fancy planning.
 Such planning has allowed this country to get by without major supply disruptions since the shah of Iran was overthrown. But the situation is about to become much trickier, as we confront the need to reduce carbon emissions on the way to a cleaner environment. Indeed, President Obama's Environmental Protection Agency now seems likely to act within months to begin restraints on carbon dioxide. This move had been resisted by the previous administration.
 Obviously, oil and gasoline are a big part of the emissions problem, and something needs to be done. I seem to have trouble breathing on too many days. Part of the solution involves more efficient cars and furnaces, and better technology at all levels. But what about a direct financial restraint on burning hydrocarbons? Might that not reduce hydrocarbon emissions, too? It is hard to believe that it wouldn't.
 Two main ways to address the issue are under discussion. One would involve a nationwide system of credits for carbon burning, with a total cap. The credits would be traded in national and maybe world markets. Entities that emit more carbon gases would have to pay more to buy these credits, and those who saved carbon would pay less and be able to sell credits to heavier users. 
 The other idea is a direct tax on carbon emissions of a stable amount. The proceeds might be refunded in whole or in part to energy producers to help with other goals, such as producing cleaner fuels.
 Both ideas have merit, but there is a tricky little history to ''cap and trade,'' which seems to be President Obama's favored approach. Because the credits would be traded on an exchange, or somewhere else, their prices would fluctuate. They could even fluctuate wildly, as prices of traded items often do. (See the stock, bond and commodity markets if you're looking for examples.)
 The European system of cap and trade has seen large fluctuations. Right now, because of the recession in European manufacturing, the cost of these carbon credits has fallen fantastically, rendering the cost of carbon emissions low. That doesn't do much for reducing emissions.
 Why add another element of uncertainty to energy production, especially if the goal of suppressing carbon-based fuel burning can be accomplished by another means? Energy companies have enough problems as it is -- including reduced supplies, political risks and wildly changing prices for raw materials. 
 Of course, the new system would be a great benefit to the people who traded the credits. But how about the rest of us? Haven't we just had a big lesson in what happens when we put traders ahead of producers and consumers? Have we forgotten that lesson already? 
 Why not do what governments usually do to reduce consumption -- namely, impose a tax that punishes the production of carbon emissions? That would also be much less sensitive to manipulation by speculators -- and the types of extremes that have led to our country's recent undoing. 
 It seems a more direct and simpler way to go, and would help ensure that gasoline will always be there when we need it.

HEADLINE: Allia Zobel and Desmond Nolan

BYLINE: By ERIC V. COPAGE

 BODY:
AFTER almost 15 years of marriage, Desmond Nolan said he and his wife, Allia Zobel Nolan, are embarking on ''the second part of our lives.''
 ''I'm working on a project that will hopefully cover me the rest of my working career,'' he said of the software product he is developing. Last spring Mr. Nolan, who is 45, quit his job as a consultant in the information technology department at Melissa & Doug, a toy company in Wilton, Conn. 
 About a year before he left his job, Ms. Zobel Nolan, who is roughly a decade older than her husband, quit her job as a senior editor at Reader's Digest in Pleasantville, N.Y. to write books full time. 
 When his wife announced to him that she wanted to leave her job, Mr. Nolan said, ''I tried to encourage her to stay. But she wasn't happy on a day-to-day basis. After a while I said, 'Go out on your own. We'll work it out.' ''
 Even with the country's darkening economic outlook since they made their decision, they remain optimistic. 
 ''This is life,'' he said. ''There's good and there's bad. We'll get through it.''
 Ms. Zobel Nolan described her first steps in early 2007 into the unknown of self-employment as ''scary.''
 ''I'd never had to balance a checkbook because I always had enough money to do what I wanted to do,'' said Ms. Zobel Nolan, who had worked as an editor for Reader's Digest for nine years. 
 ''He didn't say to me, ' You have a perfect job, why spoil it?' '' she said.
 ''He believed that if I worked hard enough, I might not be making the same money, but I could do it. That's very important. When you're scared yourself, if you have someone saying you'll never do it, that affects you.'' 
 Even before his wife began writing books full time two years ago, Mr. Nolan endured ribbing from his friends for being married to a woman who wrote a book entitled ''101 Reasons Why a Cat Is Better Than a Man.'' 
 ''It isn't male bashing,'' Ms. Zobel Nolan said she assured him, ''it's cat enhancing.'' 
 She also wrote a book called ''Younger Men Are Better Than Retin-A,'' about the virtue of younger men, which she said ''redeemed'' herself to her husband.
 The difference in their ages has never been a problem. ''I might be the younger one, but only in calendar years,'' he said. ''Allia is the younger spirit.''
 Over the years, Mr. Nolan has been his wife's emotional pillar through several crises including a detached retina that almost blinded her right eye in 1997 and a disease called reflex sympathetic dystrophy that ''makes everything you touch feel like cut glass,'' she said. 
 Finances have been a different story.
 ''It was one of the toughest issues,'' he said. ''She's more creative and trusts in God, while I'm struggling to get the finances in order, planning for the future, saving for a pension. It was stressful for the first seven years.
 ''At one point I said to myself: 'Certain things will never be exactly the way you want them to be. I've got to let it go or I'll never be happy.' '' 
 Living on one regular salary (money from the eight books she's written since she left her staff job comes in ''dribs and drabs'' from advances and royalty payments, she said) required belt tightening -- fewer new clothes, no new car.
 Nonetheless, about a year after striking out on her own, her husband announced that he, too, wanted to leave his job. 
 ''Allia was a little bit concerned that we would both be self-unemployed, as opposed to self-employed,'' Mr. Nolan recalled. 
 Ms. Zobel Nolan said: ''At first I thought, 'Jeepers, one of us has to make a lot of money.' I'm leaving, and he's leaving, and we'd have no hospitalization. But just like he let me take a risk, I said to him, 'You just do what you have to do.' It can't be all one way.''
 Luckily, or wisely, they had paid off the mortgage on their Norwalk, Conn., home, which they share with three cats, which provide Ms. Zobel Nolan with material for her books. They had also built up a nest egg, largely because of Mr. Nolan's financial prudence. 
 They renewed their vows in October 2004, in their 10th anniversary year. They took their first vows on May 7, 1994, before a justice of the peace, but chose a Roman Catholic church for their second ceremony because, ''I wanted to renew my vows in front of God,'' Ms. Zobel Nolan said.
 This from a woman who just before she met her husband had written the book, ''The Joy of Being Single,'' a list of humorous reasons why it's better for a woman to remain unattached that included ''You never have to watch 'Monday Night Football' '' and ''You can use all the hot water.''

HEADLINE: Brookhaven Race May 'Set the Tone' for Fall

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: BROOKHAVEN 

 BODY:
 PRESIDENTS' DAY was no holiday in the fierce political battle here for the top post in Suffolk County's predominant town. 
 Despite a wintry chill that morning, the race for Brookhaven supervisor was in full swing. Dozens of volunteers packed campaign headquarters for pep talks and snacks -- bagels for the Democrats, pancakes for the Republicans -- before heading out to knock on doors.
 At his headquarters in Medford, the Republican nominee, Timothy P. Mazzei, urged supporters to gear up ''our ground game.'' The Democratic candidate, Mark Lesko, cheered on his troops at a rally in Farmingville. 
 The candidates face off in a special election on March 31 to fill the vacancy created by the recent elevation of the Democratic supervisor, Brian X. Foley, to state senator.
 Their contest is also a rehearsal for the broader fall campaign for control of Brookhaven, when the supervisor and all six Town Council seats come up for re-election. Suffolk's Democratic Party chairman, Richard H. Schaffer, said, ''It's going to set the tone for November.''
 Brookhaven ranks as the ultimate political prize among Suffolk's 10 towns. At more than 300 square miles, it is Long Island's largest town and roughly equal to Nassau County. With an estimated 489,000 residents, it is home to nearly a third of Suffolk's population.
 Though it was the citadel of Suffolk Republican power as recently as the 1990s, Brookhaven is now a swing district. After a series of scandals earned it the nickname Crookhaven, Democrats won the supervisor's office and a Town Council majority in 2005 for the first time in decades. 
 The Republicans regained the council majority in 2007. Now they seek to complete their return to power by taking back the supervisor's position. But the Democrats say they are equally determined to retain that office and recapture the council majority in the fall.
 Both candidates are former prosecutors.
 Mr. Mazzei, 54, of Blue Point, worked for nearly a decade in the Suffolk district attorney's office, rising to homicide bureau chief and overseeing notable cases like the murders of John Pius, Lisa Solomon and Jessica Manners. He is now in private practice. Supporters say his background negates corruption concerns.
 Mr. Lesko, 42, of East Setauket, worked for a decade in the United States attorney's office, supervising prosecutions on Long Island, until he resigned to run. His cases included the prosecution of the Muttontown couple convicted of abusing their maids.
 The campaign has quickly grown harsh, with Mr. Mazzei criticizing his opponent as an outsider while Mr. Lesko tied his foe to ''the corrupt old guard.''
 Mr. Mazzei denied that. ''I am not part of any old guard,'' he said in an interview. ''I'm the face of the new Republicans. Instead of looking back, I'm looking forward.''
 Mr. Mazzei noted that he had lived in Brookhaven his entire life while Mr. Lesko had lived there only a few years. ''I've worked here my whole career,'' Mr. Mazzei said. ''He's never worked here. What connection does he have with the community? Zero,'' he said, forming a circle with his finger and thumb.
 But Mr. Lesko criticized Mr. Mazzei for being the last councilman appointed by the old Republican regime and misusing the council to curb Supervisor Foley's powers and reforms and to return ''several members of the old guard back into town hall.''
 Mr. Schaffer charged that John Powell, the former town and county Republican chairman convicted of extorting bribes, has been soliciting donations for Mr. Mazzei's campaign and attended a fund-raiser for him. 
 Mr. Mazzei's camp said that Mr. Powell was one of several hundred people who bought a ticket to an event but had not otherwise raised funds. 
 ''Maybe it's not a bad thing that I haven't been involved in town government,'' Mr. Lesko said. 
 He cited his prosecution of crimes in Brookhaven, including collusion by the town's asphalt suppliers, pollution at the Lawrence Aviation site in Port Jefferson Station, tax evasion by William Floyd school officials and fraud at Symbol Technologies.
 Mr. Mazzei has higher name recognition, boosted by nearly six years on the council, a year as its majority leader and service on the Bayport-Blue Point school board. Republicans enjoy a 14,000-voter enrollment edge over Democrats, and Mr. Mazzei is endorsed by the Conservative and Independence Parties.
 ''Mazzei has the name recognition advantage, and the Brookhaven Republicans are on the upswing'' under their new chairman, Jesse Garcia, after a spell of infighting, said a former Suffolk Republican party chairman, Howard C. DeMartini. Still, he said, ''I expect it to be a very competitive race.''
 Voting has shifted more Democratic, Mr. Schaffer said. For example, Mr. Foley won re-election as supervisor in 2007 by 9 percentage points.
 Mr. Schaffer estimated that the Lesko campaign will spend at least $700,000, and Mr. Mazzei estimated his budget at $500,000. 
 Both candidates say the economy is the overriding issue, and each says he has a plan to promote development and jobs. 
 Mr. Mazzei said he would expedite the approvals process. Mr. Lesko said he would provide a 100-day approval for developers who promise to offer town residents a fourth of the related construction jobs and who pay 1 percent of a new development's assessed value to a parks fund.
 Turnout in special elections is usually low, 10 to 15 percent, and both sides agree that organizing core supporters is the key to victory. ''Special elections all come down to who gets out the vote,'' Mr. DeMartini said.

HEADLINE: Touching All the Bases for a Legend

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI. 
E-mail: conn@nytimes.com

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT 

 BODY:
 FOR much of the past decade, a forlorn house, rising from the rubble just off Interstate 95 here, has served passers-by as an education of sorts in the life and contributions of James Henry O'Rourke. O'Rourke was a baseball legend and Hall of Famer who might be the only player to set records with his first and last base hits. His was the first hit in National League history in 1876, and his last came in 1904 at age 54, making him the oldest player to have a hit, a record that still stands. In between, he won eight league championships, earned a law degree from Yale University and made a fortune in business as well as baseball.
 He also built this house, a huge Victorian, with ornate ceilings, stained-glass windows and a view of Bridgeport Harbor when such a thing was worth boasting about. 
 This particular neighborhood was leveled by the wrecking ball in the late 1990s , as the first step in an urban renewal project. Cty officials and others who wanted to keep O'Rourke's memory alive hoped the site would include a museum about him. But now, with the redevelopment project still waiting, it appears that such plans may never come to pass, and the house is about to come down. 
 The house has stood vacant, but it has seen plenty of use. Vagrants slept in it, teenagers smoked marijuana in it, and judging from the refuse in the yard, it has been spectacularly popular among connoisseurs of cheap vodka.
 And every day, roughly 100,000 people drive past, bearing witness to the slow disintegration of a home once revered as the locus of a city hero. Some time in the coming weeks, though, commuters will watch a wrecking crew put the house out of its misery, making way for a new chapter in one of Bridgeport's biggest redevelopment projects.
 It is a matter of sweet historical symmetry that the person who saved the house when he was a state senator, Bill Finch, will preside over its destruction. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Finch, a Democrat who is now Bridgeport's mayor, offered an informal tour of the property at 274 Pembroke Street and of the waterfront.
 Looking up as a brisk wind peeled vinyl siding from the upper stories, Mr. Finch said that when he heard about the home's planned destruction in the late 1990s, he was already fed up with the city's habit of razing historical landmarks like the homes of P. T. Barnum or the Harral-Wheeler mansion, which was famed for its Gothic Revival architecture. 
 Mr. Finch said he had had no grand plan for the home. He had hoped private citizens would raise enough money to move the house and turn it into a museum, but by last fall it was clear that would not happen. Still, he said, the home's long, ugly farewell was worth it. ''By leaving this house that everybody sees, a lot of people know about this scholar-athlete, a great entrepreneur, a leading citizen,'' he said. ''See, it was all part of my plan!''
 Don't get Mr. Finch started on the idea that the house also represents Bridgeport's failure to advance the so-called Steel Point project, hailed for nearly 20 years as the cornerstone of the city's revival. Once planned as a seven-million-square-foot mix of commercial and residential high-rises, the proposal is now roughly half the size.
 Developers remain committed to the project, Mr. Finch said, but their partnership recently expired and one developer lost his financing during the recent global credit squeeze. ''It's complicated,'' he said. 
 For now, the area is surrounded by a wrought-iron fence to prevent dumping, and garbage sprouts through the patchy grass that is being swallowed by mud. Mr. O'Rourke, meanwhile, will get a statue, most likely at Harbor Yard, the minor-league ball field just across the water from his old home.
 That he deserves a monument seems beyond debate. In addition to his playing career, O'Rourke was a city impresario of sorts who owned and ran Newfield Park, a minor league stadium on the East End of Bridgeport. There, he hosted Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and other legends for Sunday games as they shuttled between Boston and New York.
 The son of an Irish immigrant of modest means, O'Rourke was also the first team owner in the area to hire an African-American, and when he wasn't financing real estate deals or arguing legal cases, he could be found playing catch with the neighborhood children.
 He had Thurman Munson's build, Teddy Roosevelt's bluster and Walt Frazier's weakness for ten-dollar words. Nicknamed Orator Jim, O'Rourke once unloaded this argument on an umpire, ''I am conversant with the conglomeration of facts in this case, and as my optical eyesight is of extreme excellence, I am positive of your misinformation.''
 Michael J. Bielawa, a Bridgeport librarian and poet, unearthed this quote for his book, ''Bridgeport Baseball'' (Arcadia Publishing). Mr. Bielawa and Bernard Crowley, a former Bridgeport resident and marketing executive, stumbled on O'Rourke's history in the 1980s, and helped bring the story to Mr. Finch's attention.
 The two men started a nonprofit organization, the First Hit, in 2003, and spent the past several years marching in St. Patrick's Day parades and issuing an annual award in the ballplayer's name, in hopes of raising awareness and money. Now, standing outside the O'Rourke house with Mr. Crowley on the day after the mayor's visit, Mr. Bielawa said a statue would work just fine.
 ''The house was the biggest piece of memorabilia, sure, but we have to be realistic about these things, you know?'' Mr. Bielawa said. ''It's the bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, we need that hit. We'll bunt instead of trying to hit a home run.''
 ''We'll take a walk,'' Mr. Crowley said. ''Just get on base.''
 ''Right,'' Mr. Bielawa said. ''Even the count. Just work it out.''

 BODY:
THE DAY WALL STREET EXPLODED
 A Story of America in Its First Age of Terror
 By Beverly Gage
 Illustrated. 400 pp. Oxford University Press. $27.95
 At the stroke of noon on Sept. 16, 1920, a bomb exploded along Wall Street, killing 38 people and maiming hundreds more. It was the worst terrorist bombing in the United States until the Oklahoma City attack in 1995, the worst in New York until the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. 
 The bomb was an immeasurably cruel device, most likely dynamite tied to iron sash weights that acted as shrapnel. It blew people apart where they walked out on a cool, late-summer day, tore arms and legs, hands and feet and scalps off living human beings. Others were beheaded or eviscerated, or found themselves suddenly engulfed in flames. Still more injuries were caused by a cascade of broken glass and the terrified stampede that followed. 
 The bomb's target was presumed to be the House of Morgan, which sat like a blockhouse just across the street from where the explosive had been left in a horse-drawn wagon. The Morgan bank had emerged from World War I as the single most powerful financial institution in the world, and both the firm and its principals had been under increasing attack, rhetorical and otherwise, ever since it had arranged a huge loan a few years before to help the Allies and keep the Great War going. But the only fatality inside the firm was a 24-year-old clerk. Nearly all the bank's employees were back at their desks the next morning, some of them still bandaged and bruised. The explosion merely pocked the firm's impenetrable, marble walls, the marks defiantly left where they can be seen to this day: ''the stigmata of capitalism.'' 
 As with all terrorist attacks, most of the victims were innocent bystanders, ''messengers, stenographers, clerks, salesmen, drivers,'' men and women for whom ''Wall Street was not a grand symbol of American capitalism'' but ''a place to make a modest living by selling milk, driving a car, typing reports, recording sales.'' Only seven of the dead were over the age of 40. Five of them were women, four of them teenagers. 
 Who would do such a thing? A bevy of the nation's most prominent lawmen and private detectives immediately descended on Wall Street, blaming first anarchists, then paid agents from Lenin's new government in Moscow. But years of investigation yielded nothing -- no indictments, no trials, no culprits. No one ever came forward to take responsibility for the crime, or to state what it was supposed to accomplish, and before long it had dropped from public view, lost among the sensations of the racing, giddy '20s. 
 Beverly Gage, a writer and history teacher at Yale, has brought the bombing to life again in her outstanding first book. ''The Day Wall Street Exploded'' describes in detail both the bombing itself and the hunt for the perpetrators, but Gage also does us the great good service of placing it in the wider history of industrial warfare that once proliferated in America. Like much of American history, these battles have dropped out of mind because no one wanted to look at them too closely. As Gage points out, the right was loath to discuss the decades of brutal labor and political repression that preceded the Wall Street bombing; the left, to admit that extremists really were willing to resort to violence to overthrow the capitalist order. 
 Between 1881 and 1905 alone, there were more than 37,000 labor strikes in the United States, many of them bloody, bitter struggles. Efforts to unionize were routinely met with clubbings, shootings, jailings, blacklistings and executions, perpetrated not only by well-armed legions of company goons, but also by police officers, deputies, National Guardsmen and even regular soldiers. Dozens of workers were killed in these conflicts -- at Ludlow in 1914, in the Homestead and Pullman strikes of the 1890s, at Telluride and Cripple Creek and Colorado Springs. 
 Some unionists, seeing the state aligned with the employers, struck back with dynamite, invented in 1866 and readily available at American construction sites. In Idaho in 1905, a bomb ripped the legs off Gov. Frank Steunenberg in his own front yard, after he stuck a thousand miners from the Coeur d'Alene strike in makeshift jails for months without trial. Twenty-one men died when labor radicals blew up the rabidly anti-union Los Angeles Times building in 1910. Relatively few workers were involved in such outrages, but millions did turn to the Socialist Party and the far-left Industrial Workers of the World (the Wobblies), organizations that promised to sweep away the entire capitalist system. ''Far from being an era of placid reform,'' Gage writes, ''the turn of the century was a moment in which the entire structure of American institutions -- from the government to the economy -- seemed to be up for grabs, poised to be reshaped by new movements and ideas.'' 
 A murky underworld developed, one in which some radicals -- particularly the small but implacable cells of anarchists -- really did plot assassinations and bombings, while companies tried to frame strikers and their leaders with phony bomb plots and other accusations. 
 Things came to a head when America entered World War I and the ostensibly progressive Wilson administration put aside the Constitution, jailing thousands of dissidents and suppressing the antiwar Socialists and Wobblies. On June 2, 1919, a new wave of bombs hit in apparent retaliation, including one that wrecked the home of Woodrow Wilson's attorney general, A. Mitchell Palmer, who opportunistically used the incident to start the nation's first ''Red scare.'' It became one of the most shameful campaigns in the country's history, with hundreds deported merely on suspicion of having radical proclivities. In perhaps the worst episode, an anarchist named Andrea Salsedo was found dead in his underwear on the sidewalk of Park Row in New York, below a room where the Bureau of Investigation -- predecessor to the F.B.I. -- had secretly held him for weeks. 
 The feds claimed suicide; Salsedo's family and friends saw murder. Four months later came the Wall Street bomb. What few clues there were pointed to Salsedo's comrades, members of a particularly ruthless anarchist group called the Galleanisti, named after their founder, Luigi Galleani. But the Red hunters had done their work too well, having already deported Galleani and many other potential witnesses. 
 Even though the crime was never solved, it had other repercussions. The bungled investigation and its wholesale violation of people's civil liberties, as Gage shows, led to a major housecleaning at the Bureau -- which, paradoxically, enabled the rise of the biggest civil liberties violator in American history, J. Edgar Hoover. And the bombing contributed to an atmosphere in which two other anarchists, Sacco and Vanzetti, were convicted of murder in a case that would become the great leftist cause of the decade. 
 Over time, the bombings petered out, though organized violence in labor and other disputes continued. Even now, as Gage writes, ''there remains a tendency to think of violence as an anomaly, something outside the American experience, rather than as one of the many ways that Americans have long carried out their political disputes.''

HEADLINE: Traditional Spanish, With Nuevo Influences

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
Having been a fan of Meigas, a Spanish restaurant in a restored trolley barn in downtown Norwalk, since the late 1980s, I have watched it change incrementally over the years, always under the stewardship of its owner, Ignacio Blanco. 
 This charming restaurant morphed from Meson Galicia into Meigas (Galician for benign sorceress), changed chefs en route and leapfrogged from traditional Galician cuisine into the 21st century with a Basque chef, Luis Bollo. He was influenced by Ferran Adria, the genius who invented foams, infusions and an entire new way of cooking in his Catalan restaurant, El Bulli, in Roses, Spain. 
 Now Meigas has changed again. It was recently sold to Carlos Fernandez, originally from Guatemala. The name Meigas remains intact, but the menu and food are more classic than Nuevo. Luis Bollo remains as a consulting chef, so there are still a few Nuevo influences, mostly in presentation and in desserts like the ambrosial chocolate croquettes (toasted chopped almond covered balls with warm, soft, dark chocolate inside), served on a spoon along with coconut foam and a teeny square of lemon gelatin. (One is instructed to swallow the entire spoonful at one time, to get the full effect of the different taste sensations.) 
 On the whole, though, the food has reverted to traditional Spanish, with a few modern flourishes. In fact, Miguel Docampo, who used to work for the original Meson Galicia, is back in the kitchen -- a sure sign that the menu will continue to emphasize classic Spanish cooking. 
 Sorry as I am to see the amiable, professional Senor Blanco go, I confess I am happy to find the familiar classic dishes again. For instance, Meigas now offers a terrific value: $65 for 10 tapas for two people. The tapas change often, but most of them are more ample than the usual tapas portions, thus the 10 shared dishes obviate any need for an entree. In fact, they are almost too generous to do them all justice.
 For an entree I chose braised boneless short ribs -- incredibly succulent and well-cooked -- served with a potato puree with smoked bacon, a savoy cabbage roll, crispy garlic and a whole dried apricot in a luscious ginger-infused dark-beer and soy sauce. For dessert, a light torrija bread pudding. 
 Another evening I shared the tapas special with a friend. The first two tapas arrived in tandem and seemed well mated: a plate of grilled asparagus (al dente) with a Manchego gratin in a light garlic sauce coupled with crispy crab cake with sauteed spinach and kataifi (fried noodles) in a lobster sauce. Next came a salad of grilled sea scallops, avocado, orange and beets in lemon vinaigrette, paired with grilled shrimp in a garlic sauce. And so the largesse continued for five courses of twosomes. 
 One innovation I am not crazy about is the way Meigas prepares paella. Instead of bringing the hot paella pan to the table in all its sizzling glory, an individual dish arrives, with a border of mussels and clams in their shells and jumbo shrimp, surrounding the bounteous paella of fat, short-grained saffron rice studded with chicken, chorizo, pork and peas. While the effect is attractive, the paella is deprived of that wonderful briny undercurrent that comes from many disparate ingredients cooked together.
 As an indication of the current economic situation, on Monday and Tuesday night, Meigas is offering a three-course dinner for $24 a person. This covers the entire menu, an amazing bargain. I partook of Meigas's generosity by beginning with cheese croquettes (a melding of Cabrales goat cheese with Manchego) with aioli -- runny, tangy cheese inside six tiny, crunchy exteriors. The new owner is also planning a Sunday brunch that will start March 1 with entrees priced from $14 to $20.
 In addition to its generous tapas and dinner specials, Meigas offers gratis treats to keep diners happy, including an amuse-bouche of a demitasse of vegetable soup with a tiny crab croquette, crusty bread and a pungent extra virgin olive oil dip. There's also a finale of four miniature desserts.
 Meigas's transition has been so smooth it seems quite likely that what is already a very good restaurant will soon become as excellent as it has been in the past. It doesn't have far to go.

 VERY GOOD
 THE SPACE The main dining room, with saffron-yellow walls, tiled floors and a country cupboard with ceramic plates, has the air of a Spanish countryside inn. A second, smaller dining room is usually for private parties. Quiet, conversational atmosphere. There is a ground-level entrance, but the main entrance is down a long flight of stairs. 
 THE CROWD Many couples, foursomes and small groups, casually dressed. Friendly and accommodating wait staff.

 THE BILL Lunch: tapas, $5 to $11, or 3 tapas for $15; entrees: $8 to $18. Dinner: tapas, $9 to $14, or 10 tapas (for two) for $65; entrees, $27 to $38 (on Monday and Tuesday, $24 for three courses); desserts, $9.50. All major credit cards are accepted.
 WHAT WE LIKE Cheese croquettes with aioli; grilled shrimp in garlic sauce; grilled chorizo with spinach and chickpeas;tortilla Espanola; mussels in garlic tomato sauce; crispy crab cake; almost all tapas; braised boneless short ribs; roasted suckling pig; grilled marinated pork tenderloin; chocolate croquettes, bread pudding. 
 IF YOU GO Lunch: Monday to Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Dinner: Monday to Thursday, 5 to 10 p.m.; Friday, Saturday and Sunday, 5 to 10:30 p.m. Reservations accepted. Free parking available in lot opposite the main entrance to the building.

HEADLINE: My First Book Of Urban Planning

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
ARCHITECTS may need only to point at a building to explain to their children what they do. 
 Planners aren't so lucky. 
 In fact, unless airplane windows are involved, it's probably a struggle to describe how they map out roads, stores and homes to form neighborhoods. 
 A new children's book may help shed light at a time when interest in the field seems to be growing. 
 ''Where Things Are, From Near to Far'' (Planetizen Press, $19.95), by Chris Steins and Tim Halbur, depicts a mother and son on a stroll through a city and its surroundings.
 Mr. Steins, a planner by training, said that his target audience was children like his twin sons, Rowan and Grant, who are 3. ''If we teach kids how to build them,'' he said, ''we will end up with better cities.''
 Among the book's 20 colorful pages is one with a Beaux-Arts firehouse that looks as if it could be on Great Jones Street in Manhattan. On another page, about outlying neighborhoods, row houses with rounded bays resemble those in Park Slope, Brooklyn. 
 But David Ryan, the book's illustrator, who lived in the East Village for several years, insists any resemblances are coincidental.
 According to Mr. Steins, an earlier version of the text was critical of the suburbs, telegraphing the New Urbanism point of view of architects like Andres Duany, who argues that suburbs should be less dependent on cars.
 But by the third draft ''we removed those value judgments,'' Mr. Steins said. ''We know lots of people live in the suburbs, and that every type of community has value.''
 Indeed, the busy two-lane street on Pages 9 and 10 abutting a sprawling parking lot seems a far cry from places like Seaside, Fla., the pedestrian-friendly town featured in the movie ''The Truman Show,'' perhaps Mr. Duany's best-known creation.
 Though ample children's books profile police officers, firefighters and doctors, there are comparatively few in-print titles that focus on careers in the built environment, librarians say.
 Yes, Richard Scarry's 1968 ''What Do People Do All Day?'' (Random House) famously depicts a mason, a carpenter and a plumber and, elsewhere, road-building engineers and surveyors.
 More recently, Meghan McCarthy's ''City Hawk: The Story of Pale Male'' (Simon & Schuster, 2007) dived into real estate, including specifics about the bird's nest, a 12-story limestone co-op at 927 Fifth Avenue. The building, it informed young readers, housed the actress Mary Tyler Moore ''and other wealthy dwellers.''
 Children are increasingly studying topics like planning in school, says Elizabeth Bird, the senior children's librarian at the New York Public Library. In the last few years, grade-school patrons have even come in looking for information on the planner Robert Moses, she said. 
 There are more issue-oriented books for children over all, she added; books on the environment, man-made and otherwise, join titles about cerebral palsy, say, or cyber-bullying.
 ''I think we are moving away from a time when adults want books filled with sweetness and light,'' Ms. Bird said. ''They now trust their kids with more realistic topics.''
 Others, like Ethel Sheffer, an adjunct assistant professor in the department of urban planning at Columbia University, cite news reports about what to put up at the World Trade Center site as fueling interest. 
 That interest seems to be on the rise. The New York chapter of the American Planning Association has 1,500 members, up from 500 two decades ago, which outstrips the national rate of growth, said Ms. Sheffer, a past president of the chapter.
 And six years ago, New York created the Academy of Urban Planning, a public high school in Bushwick, Brooklyn, with 450 students. 
 By focusing on planning at an earlier age, said Ms. Sheffer, who discovered her career only after college, young people can better hone their powers of observation.
 ''They can learn to look with careful eyes at the places they walk through,'' she said. ''And that's terrific.''

HEADLINE: Dodgers' Wolf Accepts Downturn

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

DATELINE: GLENDALE, Ariz. 

 BODY:
Often in sports, extravagant contracts meet extravagant egos, and attitudes contrast sharply with the rest of society's. In a penny-pinching economy, sports often holds the dollars. This off-season, the Yankees committed more than $400 million to three free agents.
 Then there is Randy Wolf, a left-handed starter beginning his second tour with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He signed a one-year, $5 million deal with $3 million in incentives after missing out on a three-year, $28.5 million contract with the Houston Astros. Through it all, he has preserved a refreshingly positive outlook. 
 He did not lose the contract because Houston suddenly soured on him or he had haggled in hopes of more money or more years. 
 Instead, as the final details were being hammered out, the Astros informed him that the economic climate had changed their financial situation and the contract would not be offered.
 Wolf learned from his agent, Arn Tellem, that the offer had been rescinded while he was at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, Calif. He was headed to visit his brother and sister-in-law for Thanksgiving in Arizona.
 He thought another team might make a multiyear offer. He waited. Nothing.
 ''After about a month -- I think it was in mid-December, and I'm usually signed by then -- I kind of realized it was a lot different this year,'' Wolf said. ''But I didn't really look back or get depressed over what could have been. I understood the reality of what was going on and just moved on and tried to make the best of what was going to go on from that point on.''
 By his statistics, Wolf is a slightly above-average pitcher. He has yet to make the playoffs in 10 seasons. The Dodgers originally drafted him in 1994, but he did not sign. He ended up in the Philadelphia Phillies organization and played with them for eight seasons.
 He finally signed with Los Angeles in 2007 and went through an injury-shortened season. In 2008, he went 12-12, splitting time with the San Diego Padres and the Astros, who saw enough to want to bring him back. 
 But that deal fell through, and he signed with the Dodgers on Feb. 6.
 Instead of being rueful, Wolf is realistic.
 ''If you're looking for a big contract, I think you've got to basically be on the Yankees' wish list,'' he said laughing. ''But you can't think that way, look back and feel sorry for yourself.
 ''I play major league baseball. It may not be under what the contract was that the Astros offered, but I make a very good living and I get to do what I love to do. With people losing their jobs, and they're making $40,000 a year and they're working their tails off 12 months a year to make ends meet, and they get laid off, it's not right for me to complain about a contract.''
 Although extravagant offers were made this off-season -- from the Yankees' signings of C. C. Sabathia, Mark Teixeira and A. J. Burnett to Manny Ramirez's rejection of a one-year, $25 million contract from the Dodgers -- this is a period of economic-induced retreat for many teams.
 The salaries that many free agents looked for simply never materialized.
 ''I'm not surprised the Yankees did, but I can understand why other teams haven't,'' said Larry Bowa, the Dodgers' third-base coach, who once filled the same role in the Bronx. ''The Yankees have a lot of assets coming in. Other teams have to watch what they do, and I can understand that.
 ''You watch the economy every day and read the stock market and read people losing jobs, you understand. There were some big-time players getting one-year contracts for five, six million. Don't get me wrong, that's a ton of money, but they're used to getting $15 million.''
 Dodgers Manager Joe Torre said he was not surprised by his former team's spending.
 ''They generate a lot of revenue,'' Torre said. ''The one thing George Steinbrenner has always been committed to is putting a winner out on the field there in New York. He's really committed to the fan base and in spite of all the negatives people tried to warn me about going to work there, I knew that was the positive -- that he was going to give you a chance to win.''
 Torre seemed mildly surprised that the former Yankees outfielder Bobby Abreu idled on the free-agent market as long as he did. He signed a one-year, $5 million deal with the Los Angeles Angels last week. 
 ''I thought he was a perfect fit for where he went,'' Torre said. ''I thought he was that type of player that the Angels could use. But it has been a slow market and I don't know any other reason other than the financial situation that you can blame it on.''
 Wolf, who was born in Southern California's Canoga Park and attended nearby Pepperdine University, was a casualty of the financial concerns some teams are facing.
 Wolf said there was little reason to feel sorry for him. As he put on his glove to exit for an early-morning workout, he spoke about how happy he was to return to the Dodgers, not how unhappy he was to land with a team that was his second choice for a contract that was not his first choice. 
 ''It's exciting,'' Wolf said. ''I saw what happened last year and how they played the second half of the year. I'm 15 minutes from the ballpark. I get to live at home. I get to go to Dodger Stadium every day.''

EVEN before the economy took a spill, Carlos Quirarte, a marketing director for brands like Earnest Sewn and Freemans Sporting Club, and his business partner, Matt Kliegman, were rethinking the retail concept. ''We always wanted to do a multiuse space, something that had a family vibe to it,'' Mr. Quirarte said. ''Now it feels even more appropriate.'' 
 The Smile, which opened unofficially on Friday, is a conceptual mash-up, housed in a rustic two-floor space designed by Luke Scarola, owner of the Brooklyn antiques store Luddite. There is a cafe, with a Mediterranean-inspired menu created by Melia Marden; a tattoo parlor, run by Scott Campbell of Saved Tattoo; a gallery curated by Mr. Quirarte (Nate Lowman's smiley-face work is now on display); and a wall of shelves filled with exclusive or custom-made products from Adam Kimmel, Sol Moscot, the Brooklyn-based lingerie line the Lake & Stars, the Parisian knitwear label Wool and the Gang, House of Waris, White's Boots and the candle maker Cire Trudon, which dates to the 17th century and designed a candle inspired by the scent of the salvaged-wood interior. ''So many stores just chase trends,'' Mr. Quirarte (right) said. ''We're trying to do something different.''

HEADLINE: Himes Returns for Coffee and Stimulus Talk

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE STUART

DATELINE: Bridgeport 

 BODY:
 THE day after Congress approved the economic stimulus package, United States Representative Jim Himes, a freshman Democrat, was back in Connecticut's Fourth Congressional District, chatting with constituents who wanted to know what the new bill would mean for them.
 ''Washington is all about words like 'unemployment,' 'the economy' and 'money supply,' '' Mr. Himes said at the Take Time Cafe here. ''You come back to the district and see the very human cost of where our economy is, and it's a lot easier for me as a congressman to pound the table driven by the stories here at home than it is to do it on the basis of abstract policy.'' 
 For his first visit to his district since being sworn in, Mr. Himes, 42, a political novice who in November defeated Representative Christopher Shays, the last Republican representative from New England, invited constituents to come talk to him about whatever was on their minds. 
 About 50 people took him up on the offer at stops he made in several coffee shops and diners in Bridgeport, Norwalk and Greenwich, and many of them wanted to talk about the economy and the stimulus package. Mr. Himes sat and talked individually with each one of them.
 At the Silver Star Diner in Norwalk, Steve Knowles, 56, of Westport wanted to know if there was anything in the stimulus package for small businesses. Mr. Knowles, who owns a small printing company, said that even if there were, many small businesses would not know where to turn for assistance. 
 Sitting in a booth, Mr. Knowles said that he had encouraged Mr. Himes to do what he could to get the banks to take on credit risk to help businesses expand while real estate is cheap. ''Right now the banks need assurance,'' he said. ''If the government could guarantee these loans, even if they default, it would be better than letting all these businesses go out of business.''
 Mr. Himes said that passage of the economic stimulus package was ''important but not sufficient to turn the economy around.'' 
 ''We need to deal with the banks, and we need to deal with the housing crisis,'' the congressman said. ''That's big and complicated, and it needs to happen fast.'' 
 At the Take Time Cafe in Bridgeport, Tom Kelly, 55, who described himself as a community advocate, expressed concern to Mr. Himes about the foreclosure problem and the need for home foreclosure relief. Some of the poorer neighborhoods in the city will be ''decimated'' if something is not done soon, Mr. Kelly said. 
 Mr. Himes, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs who was an executive with a nonprofit urban housing agency before taking office in January, did not disagree. 
 He said that a few weeks earlier, he had walked into his Stamford office and was greeted by a woman waiting to speak with him. As he shook her hand, he said, the woman broke down in tears because she was on the verge of losing her home. 
 ''Nobody is saying, 'Solve my problems,' they're just saying it shouldn't be this hard,'' Mr. Himes said. 
 Easily moving back and forth from English to Spanish, Mr. Himes, who was born in Peru and is bilingual, sat down with a Bridgeport family concerned that the cost of college for their child may be out of reach. 
 Mr. Himes said he explained the expanded education tax credit and the increase in Pell grants included in the stimulus package. But he said that he was honest with them and told them that ''it doesn't fix the problem.''
 ''This is probably the most diverse Congressional district in the country,'' Mr. Himes said. ''You've got billionaires at one end, and you've got people living in abject poverty.''
 Not everyone came to talk about the economy. Katie Tepper, 72, and Laure Dunne, 64, both of Norwalk, wanted to talk about the opportunities for change now that the Democrats control both Congress and the White House. 
 ''It's time to put some progressive ideas into action and really get some big things done,'' said Ms. Dunne, a marketing and communications specialist who was laid off in October. 
 Mr. Himes, whose first few weeks in Congress have been spent hiring staff and dealing with new computer and phone systems, said he was disappointed that Republicans in the House chose not to vote in favor of the stimulus. 
 ''I guess, naively, I would like to believe in a time of crisis we would set aside politics,'' he said. ''It's clear some of these battles may be more hard fought than some of us would like it to be.''

HEADLINE: Running A Business After Doing Time

BYLINE: By LESLIE BERLIN. 
Leslie Berlin is project historian for the Silicon Valley Archives at Stanford. E-mail: prototype@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THIS year, nearly 700,000 people will be released from state or federal prisons. They will join the worst economy in decades, many of them with limited education and little or no legitimate employment experience. And a criminal record will make it that much harder to find a job. 
 Yet newly released prisoners need to work, not just to support themselves or their families, but also because having a job correlates with staying out of trouble. One study, in December 2006, found that 89 percent of people who violate the terms of their parole or probation were unemployed. 
 In the past few years, several programs have been introduced to teach prisoners, who may have problems finding traditional employment after their release, how to work for themselves. 
 ''We try to help these guys realize that the skills they already possess from illegal ventures have real value in the business world,'' explains Catherine Rohr, founder and chief executive of the Prison Entrepreneurship Program, based in Houston. ''Major drug dealers are already proven entrepreneurs.'' 
 The program, usually called P.E.P., works with men incarcerated in Texas and spends about $15,000 on each graduate. Last year, it raised $2.5 million from private sources. Ms. Rohr, a graduate of the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, started P.E.P. in May 2004, when she was 27. She said she left a $200,000-a-year job in private equity when her Christian faith led her to embark on a life of service.
 Prisoners accepted into the five-month P.E.P. program attend class for 35 hours a week. Curtis Hogue, a former securities analyst, teaches an intensive M.B.A.-style curriculum, with lessons in finance, accounting, marketing and sales. Several dozen executives and business students volunteer as guest lecturers or as judges at a competition for the best business plan. 
 A few days each week, Ms. Rohr teaches a course on character development. She stresses what she calls ''consequence trails'' and encourages students to recognize the suffering and pain unleashed in the wake of bad decisions.
 Ms. Rohr says she believes the focus on character is essential. Without it, the program might, as she puts it, ''take an old dope dealer, equip him with a skill set and help him to become a better dope dealer when he gets out.''
 P.E.P. also sponsors comprehensive post-release programs for its graduates in Houston and Dallas. Services include housing, free or low-cost dental and medical care and an evening entrepreneurship school taught by volunteers who also serve as professional mentors.
 Since the program's inception, 441 men, roughly a quarter of whom had been incarcerated for violent crimes, have graduated. Just over 8 percent have returned to prison -- nationally, the recidivism rate exceeds 25 percent. 
 A low recidivism rate can be a misleading measure of success, warns Shawn Bushway , a criminologist at the School of Criminal Justice at the University at Albany. Prison-based work programs can be effective, he explains, but their success may say as much about the cross-section of participants as the programs themselves. 
 Ms. Rohr happily acknowledges cherry-picking the most talented prisoners who want to change their ways. She says that P.E.P. accepts only about 20 percent of its applicants. Moreover, fewer than half the students accepted last year graduated from the program. Most graduates put their business skills to work for someone else, but 57 men have begun their own businesses. These range from painting and automotive repair to catering; 32 of the 57 businesses are still operating. 
 One of the entrepreneurs is Nathan Dangerfield, owner of Promised Land Lawn Service in Houston. Mr. Dangerfield, who was released from prison in October 2006, after serving 21 months for possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, started the business in March 2008. A low-interest $2,000 loan and a $500 seed grant, both from P.E.P., financed the company. 
 Mr. Dangerfield, who has two part-time employees, declined to disclose current revenue, but says he hopes to gross $250,000 this year by expanding the number of commercial customers. He consults weekly with a mentor he met through P.E.P. Mr. Dangerfield calls the program ''the best opportunity I could have had at a second chance.''
 ANOTHER P.E.P. graduate, Jeffrey Doucette, began Save the Day Restoration and Carpet Care, in Wylie, Tex., in December. He was released from prison in January 2008, after serving 42 months for drug dealing, and says P.E.P. gave him not just business knowledge, but also honesty and integrity. ''If I don't clean the spot of carpet behind a door, I can't live with myself,'' he said.
 Many in the corrections business are wary of entrepreneurship programs, according to Deborah Mukamal, director of the Prisoner Reentry Institute at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Entrepreneurs must thrive in unstructured environments, and many ex-offenders do better with more structure, she says. In addition, failure rates among new companies are high. 
 Ms. Mukamal nonetheless commends P.E.P. and similar programs, like the Coffee Creek Prison Project in Wilsonville, Ore., and the Workshop in Business Opportunities in New York, which offers a course to introduce inmates to the basic concepts of owning a business.
 ''These are new, bold ideas,'' she says, ''and there are too many people going into prison and coming home not to try new ideas.''

HEADLINE: Art And Commerce: Not All Cashed In On Boom

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''The Boom Is Over: Long Live the Art!'' by Holland Cotter [Feb. 15]: 
 For years Mr. Cotter has said the same things: The art market is bad. Money is bad, and it's making art worse. These kids are all making bright shallow things for the ravenous art market. 
 As a struggling artist and art writer (one who makes bright shallow things), I find these critical broadsides irritating. The implication that my entire generation has been brainwashed by M.F.A. programs and transformed into craven money-hungry fiends by the art market always struck me as slightly glib and naive. 
 Now that the economy is collapsing, Mr. Cotter chimes in with a screed about how great things are going to be for art and artists now. Well, I guess Mr. Cotter doesn't know any young artists who don't make boatloads of money showing in Chelsea galleries, because it's been ''day-job time'' for artists in New York for quite a while now. 
 This economic crisis has been worse for artists than it has been for everyone else. Try living in New York with the debt of a higher education but without the increases in earning power and job security that this usually brings. It is not fun.

HEADLINE: U.S. Cash for Clunkers? Not Yet

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
AMONG the measures recently proposed in Congress for reviving auto sales in the United States were plans that would offer owners of older cars -- vehicles that, in theory at least, gobble gasoline and pour out pollutants -- vouchers toward the purchase of more efficient models.
 While none of these so-called cash-for-clunkers plans made it into the final economic stimulus package, at least one of the proposals is still considered viable by its sponsors and could turn up appended to a future bill. 
 The concept of retiring old cars met opposition from car enthusiasts concerned that classic models, valued either as restoration projects or as sources of spare parts, might be scrapped. But it has the backing of public transit advocates, environmentalists and economists, and is seen by some legislators as a better use of tax money than making loans directly to failing automakers.
 Under a Senate proposal called the Voluntary Retirement of Fuel-Inefficient Vehicles, consumers who voluntarily turn in cars or trucks that get less than 18 miles a gallon would receive vouchers worth up to $4,500 to help them buy more economical replacements.
 ''For Americans who have a clunker sitting in their driveway, this is an even better trade-in offer than they could get from any car dealership,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who proposed the measure with two Senate colleagues, Dianne Feinstein of California and Susan Collins of Maine. ''This is a classic win-win that can provide stimulus for the economy and make long-term gains for the environment.''
 The proposal is similar to programs that have been tried in several states, though not always successfully; Illinois dropped a pilot program tried in Chicago.
 One of the biggest problems with these plans is that there is little to stop consumers from turning in vehicles that they rarely drive. Drivers in California need only show that they have owned the car for at least two years and that it failed a smog test. They need not prove how much they used the vehicle, which could have been sitting unused for years.
 Texas has rules to ensure that only people who own cars can benefit from the program.
 ''It's not like you can haul in your brother's jalopy from out of the area, or raid junkyards,'' said Andrea Morrow of the Texas Drive a Clean Machine program, which specifies which cars can be bought with vouchers. ''Any time you get old ones off the road, the new ones are superior to reduce emissions.''
 In California, where a goal of the program has been to reduce air pollution, the administrators who run the program on a local level do not have accurate figures on what consumers did with the money they received for their old cars. ''There is very little data on what cars people buy,'' said Tom Evashenk, an engineer with the Air Resources Board, which tracks California's Voluntary Accelerated Vehicle Retirement Program. ''We assume it's an average fleet vehicle.''
 It is also unclear how much these programs have helped consumers and automakers. In California, most drivers receive $1,000, while in Texas, they typically get $3,000. Even that amount would only make a dent in the price of a new car. And as Steven D. Levitt, wrote in the Freakonomics blog at nytimes.com: ''People who drive clunkers are generally not in the market for new cars.''
 Indeed, nearly 60 percent of drivers who turned in cars in Texas bought used vehicles. 
 And they often bought imports: in Texas, the car that drivers most frequently purchased with their vouchers was the Toyota Corolla, followed by the Toyota Camry. The Honda Accord and the Honda Civic were the fourth and seventh most popular. Efforts in the Senate to guarantee that the money for trade-ins went to American companies failed: on Feb. 5, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa withdrew his proposal for a $10,000 voucher if drivers then bought a car assembled in the United States.
 There is also the question of whether taxpayers are getting their money's worth. From December 2007 to August 2008, Texans turned in 13,492 vehicles, costing the state $45 million. 
 In California, the five districts that administer the programs locally have had mixed success. In the Antelope Valley northeast of Los Angeles, only 153 vehicles were retired from October 2004 to May 2008. In the San Francisco region, the government has spent about $4.4 million annually and retired more than 45,000 vehicles since 1996.

 335 pp. Spiegel & Grau. $26
 In 1927, the Louisiana man of letters Lyle Saxon complained to Sherwood Anderson that none of the writers rushing down to chronicle the effects of the great Mississippi River flood seemed able to make things ''wet enough or muddy enough.'' Almost eight decades later, after Hurricane Katrina, the problem was often the opposite. Many journalists, operating more on romantic affection for New Orleans than any deep knowledge of the city, seemed unable to dry the place off, to reconstruct what had made it so distinctive to begin with. 
 Dan Baum, the author of books on Joseph Coors and the American ''war on drugs'' (a federal effort about as successful as the government's response to Katrina), showed up in New Orleans to report for The New Yorker on Aug. 31, 2005, ''two days after the levees broke.'' He stayed for three weeks, went home, came back repeatedly and, early in 2007, just moved there. (He now lives in Colorado.) Aware of journalism's failure to reimagine New Orleans as it had been before the hurricane, Baum has written a splendid book that is two-thirds prologue. The winds and waters of Katrina don't begin battering the nine lives he puts on display until the reader is past Page 200, by which time his characters and their city have been realized in all their generosity and folly. 
 ''Nine Lives'' begins in 1965 with a previous hurricane, Betsy, and moves forward in plausibly reconstructed scenes derived mostly but not solely from long conversations Baum had with his main characters. ''I conduct interviews with my laptop in my hands,'' he explains, ''and can type as fast as most people can talk.'' Baum might have settled for a jazz choir of his principals, but he's after lives, not mere voices, and toward that end has conducted a wealth of collateral interviews with ''friends, colleagues and even ex-wives'' of the nine. He has wisely chosen to render almost all the material in what novelists and writers of creative nonfiction like to call ''close third person,'' approximating the diction and consciousness of his characters but retaining the freedom to wander into the bigger picture. 
 That picture was grim enough even before Katrina struck. New Orleans was a ''sick and wounded'' city, crime-ridden and police-brutalized, its economy as fragile as a parade float. Baum understands that ''in the context of the techno-driven, profit-crazy, hyper-efficient self-image of the United States, New Orleans is a city-sized act of civil disobedience,'' but he also knows that it can be a sentimental basket case of corruption and self-delusion. ''Nine Lives'' is his ''attempt to convey what is unique and worth saving'' in the city -- first and foremost its citizenry, who seemed chillingly expendable in 2005. Baum's vivid, selective census of survivors includes ''a millionaire king of carnival from the Garden District and a retired streetcar track repairman from the Lower Ninth Ward, a transsexual bar owner from St. Claude Avenue and the jazz-playing parish coroner, a white cop from Lakeview and a black jailbird from the Goose.'' 
 What often connects them is an involvement in Mardi Gras, though they can't really be said to share the bacchanal, since the ''parallel traditions'' of white uptown and the city's poorer parts didn't truly converge even after the festivities were formally desegregated in 1991. Black men always costumed themselves as fantastical Indians, and each year, for more than half a century, Tootie Montana constructed and wore the most astonishing ''suit'' of them all. The Indians used to brawl among themselves until Tootie got them to put all their competitive energies into finery rather than fisticuffs. But long after they'd stopped battling one another, the city's police kept whaling on them. Tootie's widow, Joyce Montana, is one of Baum's nine lives. 
 The author's ''king of carnival'' is Billy Grace, who made his own money and married into an old family with a ''gigantic and historic'' mansion. In 2004, as captain of the Rex krewe -- one of the more progressive Mardi Gras organizations -- Billy made a hesitant approach, too little and too late, trying to get to know Tootie Montana. But Tootie died two months before the hurricane, and after the storm, deaths from stress and suicide diminished even Billy's privileged circle. 
 Ronald Lewis, Baum's streetcar track repairman, lived through Hurricane Betsy during his adolescence, and in the succeeding decades watched as his neighborhood in the Lower Ninth Ward was scorched by crime and then threatened with extinction from a plan to expand the locks in the city's Industrial Canal. As a young radical, Lewis distributed Black Panther literature, but his self-respect really ''went back to Mama: you got to do their work, but you don't have to give them a song and dance.'' By the early 1990s, Lewis was helping to start a second-line club of musicians and marchers in the more-than-ever beleaguered Lower Ninth, even though ''second-lining was a city thing, and the people here cross the canal had always remained, at heart, country people.'' Lewis eventually started a museum for the group's costumes -- and began rebuilding it after the deluge. Baum's title has a clear double meaning, with ''Nine'' also standing for the ward and ''Lives'' acting as a verb. 
 During the 1960s, Frank Minyard was a big-spending, hard-partying, womanizing gynecologist, until a depressive crisis pushed him into good works and a run for coroner, an office from which he could legally introduce a methadone program for the city's prisoners. In the late summer of 2005, after decades autopsying the violence performed by and on the city's police, Minyard found himself swimming up Canal Street, through trash and feces, to his office, where he valiantly objected to the use of the word ''drowning'' on death certificates for people who had in fact ''died from heat exhaustion, dehydration, stress, and from being without their medication -- from neglect, basically.'' 
 Every so often, sentimentality gets the better of Baum. A reader may lose patience with the italicized jive of Anthony Wells (the only character presented in the first person), a ''jailbird'' before and after his displacement from the city, and with Tim Bruneau, a battered, racially prejudiced cop who sees the city as ''one big misdemeanor lockup.'' When, during Katrina, Bruneau shelters in his unmarked car the corpse of a young black woman rejected as ''the city's trash'' by a doctor running the morgue at University Hospital, the policeman has probably the finest moment in his life. But his ensuing, ruminative dialogues with the body can make a reader cringe. 
 Then again, these excesses are no worse than a last drink that might have been resisted at the end of an evening crowded with memorable characters. Baum continually serves up wonderful detail and phrasing: during Katrina ''the tang of a thousand busted-open oak trees made the air taste scrubbed,'' and after it downtown was full of ''law enforcement golf shirts with their guns in the open like the genitals on short-haired street dogs.'' People in ''Nine Lives'' sometimes use the phrase ''You feel me?'' the way other people say ''You understand?'' If Baum had employed these words as the last line of his book, as a question about everything he's told us, the answer would be a firm, appreciative yes.

HEADLINE: The Sofa That Ate Brooklyn

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
WHEN Kimberly Oliver and Stuart Sclater-Booth decided to move in together, they knew that neither of their apartments was exactly right. 
 Her loft, in Williamsburg, wasn't set up for his three children, who visit regularly. And his apartment, in Brooklyn Heights, wasn't large enough for her furniture, acquired mostly from various employers in the home-furnishings business. ''I've been in the industry since college,'' said Ms. Oliver, 39.
 Luckily, friends were giving up their apartment in a town house on Hicks Street, in one of the quaintest parts of Brooklyn Heights. (The cross streets have names like Cranberry and Orange.) The red-brick building was built in the late 19th century.
 The place, which occupies three floors of the house, seems reasonably priced, even at $4,750 a month. With three fireplaces, old wooden banisters and an ample backyard, it had been the well-loved home of a family that moved to New Hampshire and began renting it out. 
 Coziness is important to the couple, who wanted to make sure Mr. Sclater-Booth's children, Eliza, 9, Luke, 8, and Charlie, 4, felt comfortable during their visits.
 But if the setting is vintage, the couple's possessions are not. Much of their furniture is from Design Within Reach, the marketer of modern classics. Ms. Oliver is the public relations manager for the company. (Though it is based in San Francisco, she has an office behind the Brooklyn Heights store.)
 Yet the home is hardly a Design Within Reach catalog. For one thing, their most prominent piece, a huge sectional sofa, is an item the company decided not to sell.
 According to Ms. Oliver, DWR considered adding the sofa to its line, which is why it acquired a ''review sample'' from the manufacturer, in Belgium. The gray and russet sectional, as large as some Manhattan living rooms, would have sold for about $28,000, she said. The company, given its ''within reach'' mission, passed. 
 So it shipped the sample over to the DWR Annex, an outlet store that is open to the public in Secaucus, N.J. Ms. Oliver spotted it there and called Mr. Sclater-Booth, whom she had recently started dating. ''You've got to come to New Jersey right now,'' she said. 
 When he arrived, the sofa didn't look like much. The pieces were stacked up, and his children began climbing all over them. Still, Ms. Oliver persuaded him to buy it, after bargaining the price down to $1,000.
 ''I liked it,'' Mr. Sclater-Booth said. ''But when I realized it was $28,000, I found out I'm very shallow, because I liked it even more.''
 The piece, divided in two, is now the mainstay of both the living room (which occupies most of the first floor), and the den (on the second floor). The living room is pretty much off-limits to the children, because it contains several fragile pieces, including a marble-topped table by Eero Saarinen, and a large porcelain greyhound (the couple's ersatz pet, named Coco). ''I wouldn't want the pieces, or the children, to get hurt,'' Ms. Oliver said. 
 The den, in which everyone is welcome, contains several pieces that Mr. Sclater-Booth bought before he met Ms. Oliver at a party in 2007. One is a chaise by Le Corbusier, which Ms. Oliver describes as a bachelor cliche. (Forget that it is sold by her employer.) In the center of the room is a collection of cork tables by Jasper Morrison, which Ms. Oliver described as very child-friendly. 
 ''They make wonderful mountains for little army men to play on,'' Mr. Sclater-Booth, also 39, observed.
 On the third floor are two bedrooms for the children: the boys share the front room, with bunk beds; Eliza has a back room with a grown-up bed. The bedroom that Ms. Oliver and Mr. Sclater-Booth share is below hers.
 The backyard, to the east of the house, is in shade most of the day, one of the couple's few complaints. Another is that the kitchen, with its mismatched cabinets and outdated appliances, is functional, but far from lovely. 
 The couple attended Vassar at the same time, but hardly knew each other. ''I did a lot of feminist stuff,'' Ms. Oliver recalled. ''Stuart was on the rugby team.'' 
 After college, Ms. Oliver, who was raised in Maine, took a job in San Francisco, where she worked for architects and furniture retailers. She moved to New York in 2002 to work for Vitra, the German furniture manufacturer, which was opening a showroom in the Meatpacking District. 
 Ms. Oliver, who suffers from hair loss due to alopecia, a benign auto-immune disorder, said: ''I used to wear wigs, but about six months after I moved to New York I decided to be brave -- this city is inspirational in that way -- and being bald has now become part of who I am.'' 
 In 2007, she was offered the public relations job at Design Within Reach. Lately, DWR -- its share price depressed -- has been weighing options, including a possible sale of the company, according to its chief executive officer, Ray Brunner.
 Before taking her current job, she worked as a design promoter, helping to create Haute Green, an annual showcase for hip, environmentally responsible furniture that coincides with the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York each spring.
 And she did public relations for David Weeks, the Dumbo lighting designer who works in a midcentury idiom. Not surprisingly, the house contains nearly a dozen pieces by Mr. Weeks, including several from his end-of-year sales. ''There's not a lot that I bought retail,'' Ms. Oliver said.
 At Vassar, Mr. Sclater-Booth -- who grew up on the West Side of Manhattan -- studied economics. He became an expert in emerging markets, working at the Federal Reserve Bank and Paine Webber before landing at JPMorgan. After 11 years his job there ended recently; now, he said, ''My job is looking for a job.'' 
 In the meantime, he has more time for his children, and for the house, which shows its age. ''The kids were playing with the banister and one of the rails basically disintegrated,'' Ms. Oliver said. And the inside knob on the front door has a habit of falling off.
 Ms. Oliver and Mr. Sclater-Booth do what they can to help maintain the place, despite the fact that they are merely tenants.
 ''It's an old house,'' Ms. Oliver said. ''You have to give it love.''

HEADLINE: Again, a Time to Wait for Whatever

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
''Let us not then speak ill of our generation, it is not any unhappier than its predecessors. Let us not speak well of it either. Let us not speak of it at all.''
 -- Pozzo in Samuel Beckett's
 ''Waiting for Godot''
 HERE he comes again. Or rather, here he doesn't come again. And it is just possible that in the silence of his nonarrival this year, theatergoers who never knew his name, or haven't thought about him in ages, may hear the sound of their own troubled thoughts quite clearly. Is Broadway finally ready to worship Godot?
 It's been more than half a century since ''Waiting for Godot,'' Samuel Beckett's watershed portrait of two tramps' rendezvous with nothingness, was staged at the John Golden Theater, where it was greeted with some respect, some derision and much puzzlement. ''Don't expect this column to explain Samuel Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot,' '' read the first sentence of Brooks Atkinson's review in The New York Times on April 20, 1956. ''It is a mystery wrapped in an enigma.'' 
 The show, which featured Bert Lahr and E. G. Marshall, ran for 60 performances and was revived the following year with an all-black cast, when it lasted for a mere six performances. And there you have the entire history of Broadway's relationship with ''Waiting for Godot,'' a play that seemed destined to be consigned forever after in New York to small theaters catering to bookish audiences. (Lincoln Center Theater's much publicized Mike Nichols version in 1988, with Steve Martin and Robin Williams, was an Off Broadway production.) Yet this spring Beckett's mangy, aimless tramps promise to be the It boys of the mainstream English-speaking theater with deluxe productions both on Broadway (opening April 30 at Studio 54, starring Nathan Lane and Bill Irwin, directed by Anthony Page) and in London's West End (at the Theater Royal Haymarket, starting April 30, with the heavy hitters Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, directed by Sean Mathias). And for New York theatergoers wanting a double dose of existential absurdity, there's Eugene Ionesco's ''Exit the King,'' a short, ruthless and funny study of a decaying monarch in flight from his own death, which opens next month at the Barrymore Theater, in a production from the Australian director Neil Armfield, with a cast led by Geoffrey Rush and Susan Sarandon. The last time it was seen on Broadway was 1968, when it ran for 47 performances.
 What gives? How is that two austere, cryptic works more often studied than seen have sneaked back into a tourist-courting district dominated by musicals based on cartoons? Well, you could say they are following a path increasingly taken by budget-conscious, recession-era Broadway producers: big stars in small productions, a trend that this season also embraces Jane Fonda in Moises Kaufman's ''33 Variations'' and Joan Allen and Jeremy Irons in Michael Jacobs's ''Impressionism.'' (Roger Blin, the French director and actor who presented the world premiere of ''Waiting for Godot'' in Paris in 1953, said he chose it over another, more elaborate Beckett play ''because there were only four actors, and they were bums.'')
 But there's another, deeper reason that the moment seems right for ''Waiting for Godot'' and ''Exit the King.'' A time of recession and transition -- when the smoke screen generated by years of frantic getting and spending suddenly evaporates -- is perhaps exactly the time to contemplate life stripped down to its naked essentials, or what Shakespeare's Lear called ''unaccommodated man.'' 
 In ''Exit the King'' (newly translated by Mr. Armfield and Mr. Rush) the title character's acerbic, older wife (one of two), musing on the sorry state into which her country has fallen, describes her husband in a way that brings to mind the United States of the last two decades: ''He's been like one of those travelers who falls in love with every hotel along the way and forgets the purpose of his journey.'' She also observes impatiently: ''We don't have time to take our time. The frolics are over. The good times are over. Days of plenty -- over.''
 In ''Godot'' Vladimir, the more philosophical of the two tramps, provides a diagnosis that, out of context, seems even more eerily relevant: ''On the other hand, what's the good of losing heart now, that's what I say. We should have thought of it a million years ago, in the '90s.'' There's both blitheness and despair in those words. Classified by that oxymoronic label ''tragicomedy,'' ''Godot'' and ''The King'' speak directly to those feelings of desperation that people refer to when they say, ''I don't know whether to laugh or cry.''
 In a sense New York theatergoers have already been steeped in this sensibility with the recent boom in high-profile, star-studded productions of plays by Anton Chekhov, starting with last fall's ''Seagull'' on Broadway and including current offerings like Sam Mendes's Anglo-American ''Cherry Orchard'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, ''Three Sisters'' at the Classical Theater of Harlem and ''Uncle Vanya'' at the Classic Stage Company.
 In ''Chekhov's Plays: An Opening Into Eternity,'' Richard Gilman talks about how Chekhov anticipates Beckett. ''In their plays -- so much straitening, so much absence!'' Gilman writes, adding that for the characters of both playwrights, ''The inescapable fact is that there's nothing much to do.''
 In portraying the restless, hope-strapped lives of provincial Russians waiting for trips to Moscow, romantic pairings and economic deliverances that never come, Chekhov wrote plays that elude easy categorization, calling ''The Seagull,'' which ends tragically, a comedy. Much of the strength of Ian Rickson's recent staging of that play came from its grasp of this paradox, from its sense that life is too funny to be sad, and vice versa.
 Ionesco, the Romanian-born French author of what are often called metaphysical farces, shared this point of view. Among his artistic antecedents, he said, he numbered ''Job, Shakespeare's Richard II, King Solomon, the Marx Brothers, Charlie Chaplin, the Keystone Cops.'' And ''Waiting for Godot'' seems descended from both the uncompromising bleakness of ''King Lear'' and the vaudeville routines of the British music hall. (Beckett gave equal weight to both aspects, and, in a letter to Blin about the importance of nailing a scene in which one of the tramps' pants falls down, wrote, ''The spirit of the play, to the extent that it has one, is that nothing is more grotesque than the tragic.'')
 As has often been observed, nothing really happens in ''Godot.'' It depicts and is about marking time on the way from the cradle to the grave. (The critic Kenneth Tynan, reviewing ''Waiting for Godot'' in London in 1955, wrote of Beckett, ''Passing the time in the dark, he suggests, is not only what drama is about but also what life is about.'') 
 Not much more occurs in ''Exit the King.'' It's a protracted death watch, in which the title character is told shortly after his entrance: ''You are going to die in an hour and a half. You are going to die at the end of the play.''
 But it is one of the happier contradictions (amid the sea of contradictions one faces in the works of Beckett and Ionesco) that, in the right performances, a pure and vital dynamic that is quintessential theater emerges from the depiction of stasis and decay. Ionesco's king may be dying, but, oh, the energy he radiates in clinging to life. 
 Vladimir, in speaking of his fellow members of the human race, says, ''They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams for an instant, then it's night once more. On.''
 That quotation captures precisely why a good production of ''Waiting for Godot'' is never a bummer. The play, in its most abstract sense, may be about mortal darkness, but what it portrays is that instant of gleaming light. Somehow in that ''On'' lies more poignant hope and determination than a dozen inspirational Hollywood beat-the-odds movies.

HEADLINE: Trapped in Their Own Homes

BYLINE: By MARY JO PATTERSON

 BODY:
ON May 1, 2007, a very different economic era, Janet Faello put her former marital home on the market for $829,000. She and her husband were divorcing.
 It seemed like a good price for the house, a six-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath ranch in Dix Hills in Suffolk County on Long Island. But it didn't sell at that price, or at $750,000, where it landed six months later, or at $699,000, where it stands now. 
 ''It's not the Taj Mahal, but it's a nice, well-maintained home,'' said Ms. Faello, a 53-year-old massage therapist with two daughters in college who remains in the house, which she and her ex-husband still jointly own. Her ex-husband lives elsewhere. ''I haven't been entertained once with an offer, and I'm still not getting any bites.''
 With the house unsold, Ms. Faello said she and her ex-husband are struggling to meet expenses. Taxes alone are $13,860 a year. 
 ''I'm not ashamed to say to you, I have had to borrow money from my father,'' she said. ''We each want to move on. We're just hoping and praying things will turn around.''
 Would-be sellers in New York City's suburbs understand her pain, whether they are trying to sell a Cape Cod for $300,000 or a center hall Colonial for $1 million. In a housing market characterized by eroding home values, high inventory and tight credit for borrowers, many feel stuck in a place they don't want or can't afford. As the recession becomes more severe and unemployment mounts, they fret each week their properties remain unsold, and fear losing equity. While buyers hunt for exceptional values, sellers feel like hostages. And their pain is sometimes drawn out when deals that seem to be done blow up just before the closing.
 ''I have an offer and we've accepted it,'' said Ray Lopez of Croton-on-Hudson, a manager for Metro-North Railroad who has been trying to sell his house since last March. Last year he signed a contract, but learned two weeks before the closing that the buyer could not get a mortgage. While he hopes the current deal will go through, he said he won't relax until three weeks after the closing. ''Anything could happen,'' he said. ''You don't know till you have the check in your hand.'' 
 All real estate is local, as brokers like to say, and comparable sales information is most useful within a smaller neighborhood, because prices vary so much even within one community. 
 Nevertheless, all the reporting agencies are concluding that the number of sales of single-family homes in 2008 was down from 2007 in the New York metropolitan area, and prices in general were down. The median price for a home sold in the metropolitan area was $458,600 in the fourth quarter of 2008, down 11.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Those figures reflect the agency's tracking of sales in Bergen, Hudson and Passaic Counties in New Jersey; and the Bronx, Kings, Putnam and Westchester Counties in New York. 
 The number of pending home sales in the Northeast, meanwhile, decreased 14.5 percent from December 2007 to December 2008, according to the National Association of Realtors. And some experts are warning that the housing market may not hit rock bottom for at least another year.
 A seller's anguish may not be as sharp as the pain of a homeowner facing foreclosure. But the situation can alter life plans and jettison hopes. 
 Some sellers are losing hope.
 Consider Mary Beth Lang of Shelton, Conn. She is 62, with grown children and a husband who retired as a buyer for a technology company. Her dream went like this: sell the house and move to their new custom home in Kentucky.
 Her five-bedroom, four-bath house went on the market for more than $1 million in 2006. The price has since slid to $875,000, but there are no takers. Repainted, with many personal effects removed to look less cluttered, it no longer feels like home. The Kentucky house? It's for sale, too. 
 ''Sometimes dreams just blow away,'' Ms. Lang said. ''Everything is incredibly depressing. Of course, there are people with sadder stories.''
 Conventional wisdom holds that well-priced, attractive and aggressively marketed homes will sell. Now that is not necessarily true, said Cynthia Lippolis, principal broker with River Towns GMAC Real Estate in Croton-on-Hudson. ''I have some good listings that are priced very well and attractive, yet they are sitting there,'' she said. ''The economy is holding everyone back.''
 James Bednar, a real estate agent representing buyers at DRI Real Estate Company in Ridgewood, N.J., said many sellers overvalue their homes.
 ''The industry has nailed into people's minds that their houses are worth a certain amount,'' said Mr. Bednar, who blogs about the New Jersey market at njrereport.com. ''Sellers remember what neighbors sold their houses for two years ago and hold on to those unrealistic comparables. They need to accept the current reality of the market.'' 
 Mr. Bednar said he knows that sellers do not always have the leeway to drop their price. Others will be asked to pay a steep price for features buyers consider undesirable.
 ''In a boom time, buyers tend to overlook things like a high tension line that's a little close to the house, a street that's a little too busy or an odd layout,'' Mr. Bednar said. ''In a down market like this, those preferences are magnified.'' 
 JONATHAN GREENBERG paid $792,000 for a lake house in Montville, N.J., in 2005, attracted by its unusual architecture and striking views. Then he invested nearly $100,000 in improvements. At the time he was single, but is now married and a father. With its steep slopes and 30-foot drop to the lake, the property is not ''kid-friendly,'' said Mr. Greenberg, who sells investment properties for a living. He listed the house a year ago for $930,000. The price is now $670,000. 
 ''People say they love it, but it doesn't have some of the fundamentals families are looking for,'' said Mr. Greenberg, 41, whose wife, Malu, is expecting a second child. ''It'd be perfect for New Yorkers who need some kind of getaway. It's stressful. We do feel stuck.''
 Some sellers manage to find equilibrium in limbo. 
 Pamela and Daniel Greenhall of Aberdeen Township, N.J., have been trying to sell their ranch-style home since May, when they learned they were expecting a third child. Their house, priced at $279,900, has three bedrooms and one bath. Mrs. Greenhall, 33, a school counselor, and her husband, 33, a carpenter, bought the house for $235,000 in 2004 and took out a loan for renovations. ''If it sold, we wouldn't stand to make a dime,'' she said.
 Last month Mrs. Greenhall prepared for the new baby by converting one child's bedroom into a nursery and doubling the children up in the other.
 ''We're blessed in that we can still afford it,'' said Mrs. Greenhall, who delivered a boy on Feb. 3. ''We're comfortable. Is it a little cramped? Yes. Am I being overtaken by toys? Yes. But that's O.K.''
 Margaret and Matt Brown, teachers in Westchester, took a similar approach. Last spring, when Mrs. Brown, 38, was pregnant with their second child, they listed their two-bedroom home in White Plains for $519,000. Within a month they reduced the price to $499,000.
 As the baby's birth approached, the couple took the house off the market. Just then a buyer offered $475,000, but the couple rejected the offer.
 ''Now it's $465,000,'' said Mrs. Brown, a little ruefully, referring to the current asking price. 
 The new baby arrived last June, and in January the house was put back on the market. On the Feb. 7-8 weekend the Browns staged an open house themselves, after listing their home on Craigslist, placing advertisements in two newspapers and sending e-mail messages to everyone they know.
 Twenty-three people showed up. Mrs. Brown said that 11 knew about the open house from a sign outside; 6 spied the listing on Craigslist; 4 were referred by friends; and one saw a newspaper advertisement. (One declined to talk.)
 In the meantime, the Browns made an offer on a bigger house conditioned on the sale of their house. The owners accepted it, but are leaving the country and anxious to sell.
 ''That puts a little pressure on us,'' Mrs. Brown said. After the open house she paid to list the house with an online multiple listing service. 
 People who move into a new place before selling their old one feel even more stressed. Take Patrick Sweeney, 43, a father of three from Rowayton, Conn., who put his home on the market after he and his wife agreed to divorce and moved into separate homes. Mr. Sweeney is a builder who constructed the six-bedroom, six-bath house himself. 
 The house went on the market last month for $1,995,000, $300,000 less than Mr. Sweeney had banked on. There were no offers. He was surprised.
 ''The thinking was always, 'It will sell in a heartbeat,' '' Mr. Sweeney said. 
 He is worried now, and he plans to drop the price this spring. ''This can't go on forever,'' he said. ''It's got to go. We're paying to keep the heat on.''
 In spite of the months without a buyer, Ms. Faello of Dix Hills is still optimistic that her house will sell, if she can just find the right approach. First she listed with a broker, then switched to an online multiple listing service that charged a flat fee. She also listed the property on Craigslist, which cost her nothing, and on ForSaleByOwner.com, which charged. Recently she began interviewing new real estate agents.
 ''I feel as if I get a little sharper each time,'' she said. ''The amazing thing is, they'll see your home and come up with a number they justify by saying they've sold homes for that in the area. But list with them, and they're ready to drop the price.''

HEADLINE: Smoothing the Way To Self-Employment

BYLINE: By KELLEY HOLLAND. 
E-mail: newmanage@nytimes.com

 BODY:
BEING your own boss. Hanging out your shingle. Striking out on your own. In a society that reveres rugged individualism, self-employment has always had a certain allure. 
 In fact, each month from 2002 through 2007, just under 300 of every 100,000 adults in the United States started a business, according to the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity.
 When the economy is strong, people may try self-employment because the opportunities seem plentiful and financing is easy to get. And in harder times like these, it can seem a tempting option for people who have just been laid off -- or are watching as colleagues all around them lose their jobs. 
 But mystique aside, is self-employment always an attractive option? 
 Working for yourself offers distinct advantages, and they go beyond the ability to wear slippers to work. (Who, me?) You can say goodbye to that usually pointless 10 a.m. sales meeting, for example. Your schedule is often your own. 
 If a one-person business succeeds -- well, owner takes all. And when opportunities surface, there is no bureaucracy to slow response time. 
 Brian Wilkerson, global practice director for talent management at Watson Wyatt, previously experienced both the pluses and minuses of self-employment, when he owned and ran a consulting business. Among the pluses: ''If I have five big service lines in a big consulting company and a client comes with a request, we go through a whole big process. If I'm on my own, I can respond right away.'' 
 He said he used to get two or three calls a month from people thinking about starting a business. But in the last six months, he has heard from two or three every week. He suspects that some are weighing self-employment as a stopgap, not as a long-term choice.
 All his callers may find, however, that being their own boss is harder than they expected. Preliminary results indicate that the rate of people going into business for themselves actually declined in 2008, said Robert W. Fairlie, a professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who developed the Kauffman survey. He says he suspects that's because new businesses found financing harder to get. 
 Apart from the money, switching from corporate functionary to swashbuckling entrepreneur isn't nearly as simple as it seems. Isolation and loneliness are possibilities, and the risk of failure is high. Fewer than half of all start-ups survive five years, and only 25 percent last 10 years, according to Ari Ginsberg, professor of management and organizations at the Stern School of Business at New York University. Moreover, a failed stint in self-employment is not exactly a plus for a resume. 
 What helps, several experts say, is thinking of self-employment as a business problem and adjusting corporate management skills to a one-person operation. 
 Consider performance measurement. An independent marketing consultant needs a set of business goals just as much as a midlevel corporate marketer needs performance objectives. A writer I know sets goals for how many words she will publish each year, how many publications she will approach for assignments, and so on. 
 ''Self-employed people need to create a structure for themselves, and a schedule,'' said Howard Seidel, a partner at Essex Partners, an outplacement and career counseling firm specializing in senior executives. ''They need to create measurements for themselves. If you have a business plan to map against, you can look at what you're doing.'' 
 Then there is administration. A corporate manager relies on others to handle filing, purchasing and the like, but that infrastructure disappears in a one-person shop. There is no lawyer on staff, and no one to order Post-it notes. Self-employed people who learn to manage behind-the-scenes functions efficiently have more time for their core business. 
 They also need to focus on selling, Mr. Seidel said. ''Not everyone who comes through here is a salesperson, or wants to be,'' he said. ''But for the most part, you have to accept that you are a salesperson, and build that into your infrastructure.''
 The newly self-employed also have no team members with whom they can toss around ideas. Mr. Seidel says some of his clients use him as a sounding board or set up an advisory board, perhaps including former colleagues.
 THE self-employed also need certain skills that they may not have developed in corporate life, Professor Ginsberg said. ''The challenges are skill-related and also attitude-related,'' he said. ''You have to have the stomach for setbacks, great tenacity and commitment and passion. Those are things that you can't take for granted that someone necessarily possesses as a career manager.'' 
 Yet some self-employed professionals say independence is worth that challenge. ''It is an enormous change,'' said Gary Rich, a former human resources executive and founder of Rich Leadership, an executive coaching firm. ''All of the structure in your world goes away,'' along with features like a tech help desk, he said. 
 ''But I'd rather be on the phone here at home with Dell trying to decipher why my computer sounds like a garbage truck than sitting on the 33rd floor of a building in New York writing memos.''

HEADLINE: Nervous Agencies Change Ways

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
SELLERS and buyers are not the only jittery players in today's housing market. Real estate offices along Main Streets throughout Westchester County are struggling to stay in business during one of the worst markets in decades, and at the same time shift away from their traditional job description to become more competitive players on the Internet.
 Reflecting the grave state of the market, Houlihan Lawrence, a family-owned real estate company dating back to the 1950s, announced on Feb. 13 that it was laying off 10 percent of its employees -- although not its sales agents, who work as independent contractors. 
 During the past six months, the company has shuttered 5 of its 30 offices and is planning more closings as it increasingly conducts business on the Web, said Chris Meyers, the chief operating officer.
 ''It's all part of our down-market strategy,'' Mr. Meyers said. ''Since September the economy has been in a rapid decline, and we can't run faster than this wave any longer.'' 
 The company is also increasingly advertising on the Web and establishing business alliances with online listing sites like Trulia.com. ''It's striking how consumer behavior has changed,'' he added, ''and as a result we have had to shift our strategies to meet them.''
 But as the agencies themselves change tactics, so must the agents, said Mark Boyland, the president of the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. ''The old model of a sales agent who just takes listings, hosts a couple of open houses, and places an ad or two is not enough anymore,'' he said.
 A new breed of agent is emerging, wise in the ways of short sales and other foreclosure avoidance techniques. ''That's going to be a large part of the business going forward into the next several years,'' said Mr. Boyland, who is also an associate broker for Keller Williams in White Plains. ''Lots of homeowners have lost jobs and had their salaries and/or hours reduced, and they're in trouble.''
 According to RealtyTrac.com, 2,259 Westchester homes are in preforeclosure (meaning their owners have defaulted on the mortgage, but formal proceedings have not yet begun); 237 are about to be auctioned; and 358 are about to be taken over by banks. Adjustable-rate mortgages that are scheduled to be reset this year could affect those numbers, said Alex Charfen, the president and chief executive of the Distressed Property Institute in Boca Raton, Fla. 
 Mr. Charfen's company offers courses in foreclosure avoidance techniques and short sales, among other things, for real estate agencies. The Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service and several real estate agencies are offering classes and seminars on the new financing. Houlihan Lawrence, for instance, has opened a training center to teach agents the use of networking tools like Facebook and LinkedIn, as well as other Internet marketing techniques. 
 As Bill Holmes, the president of Prudential Holmes & Kennedy, put it: ''Agents have to know so much more when making a sale today. There are just so many roadblocks in the way.''
 Holmes & Kennedy, which serves Westchester and Putnam Counties, has laid off workers or reduced their hours, Mr. Holmes said, but it has not closed any of its six offices.
 ''We're really all waiting to see what the news may be from D.C.,'' he said. ''Hopefully then we'll have a better understanding of where things are headed.''
 Still, with the number and dollar value of sales plummeting, and far less business to go around, a sizable number of agents are fleeing the field, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive of the listing service. At the end of 2008, the service had a membership of 7,628; by the end of this year, he predicted that number would be closer to 7,100.
 ''We're witnessing wrenching changes,'' he said, adding that several mergers and acquisitions were also taking place. ''It's no surprise the industry is contracting.''
 Prudential Rand recently acquired Shaw Properties in Yonkers, Nelson-Vrooman Associates in White Plains and Gibbons Realty in Dobbs Ferry. Greg Rand, an owner, said the agency would be announcing more acquisitions in the coming months. Prudential Rand has 20 offices in the Hudson Valley, 7 of them in Westchester. 
 Meanwhile, in a move that seems counterintuitive in light of all this contraction, a real estate company has opened a new office in Scarsdale: Engel & Volkers, which is based in Hamburg, Germany, and has 400 offices worldwide.
 ''The local agencies are missing half of the market,'' said Jonathan Lerner, the managing director of the company's new franchises in Scarsdale and South Hampton. ''Buyers today are as likely to come from Berlin as from Boston.'' 
 As for opening in a down market -- while other agencies are letting workers go, and sales agents are becoming increasingly frustrated -- Mr. Lerner said: ''Maybe it's not such a bad time. If the market was so great, we'd have a much harder time getting some of those experienced people the other agencies are laying off to work for us. Some things about this market may not be that bad after all.''

HEADLINE: Expect the Worst and You May Get It

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics at Yale and chief economist at MacroMarkets LLC. He and George A. Akerlof are the authors of ''Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism'' (Princeton University Press).

 BODY:
PEOPLE everywhere are talking about the Great Depression, which followed the October 1929 stock market crash and lasted until the United States entered World War II. It is a vivid story of year upon year of despair. 
 This Depression narrative, however, is not merely a story about the past: It has started to inform our current expectations.
 According to the Reuters-University of Michigan Survey of Consumers earlier this month, nearly two-thirds of consumers expected that the present downturn would last for five more years. President Obama, in his first press conference, evoked the Depression in warning of a ''negative spiral'' that ''becomes difficult for us to get out of'' and suggested the possibility of a ''lost decade,'' as in Japan in the 1990s. 
 He said Congress needed to pass an economic stimulus package -- as it ultimately did -- to prevent this calamity.
 The attention paid to the Depression story may seem a logical consequence of our economic situation. But the retelling, in fact, is a cause of the current situation -- because the Great Depression serves as a model for our expectations, damping what John Maynard Keynes called our ''animal spirits,'' reducing consumers' willingness to spend and businesses' willingness to hire and expand. The Depression narrative could easily end up as a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
 The popular response to vivid accounts of past depressions is partly psychological, but it has a rational base. We have to look at past episodes because economic theory, lacking the physical constants of the hard sciences, has never offered a complete account of the mechanics of depressions. 
 The Great Depression does appear genuinely relevant. The bursting of twin bubbles in the stock and real estate markets, accompanied by huge failures of financial institutions and a drop in confidence, has no more recent example than that of the 1930s. 
 This isn't the first time that the Great Depression has become an active story. It also was heard during the recession of 1981 and 1982, which resulted in unemployment rates of nearly 11 percent. 
 Hyman Minsky wrote a 1982 book, ''Can 'It' Happen Again?,'' that raised the possibility of a new depression. But the widespread perception then was that the decline was caused by the Federal Reserve, which had clamped down on the money supply to end out-of-control inflation. Depression fear did not take off.
 The Great Depression also received some attention after the market crash of 1987. But then the stock market crisis was widely perceived as having been caused by a technical strategy called program trading, and again there was no huge banking crisis or loss of confidence.
 This time is different: the Great Depression appears truly relevant, and many people have been spooked by the story.
 To understand the story's significance in driving our thinking, it is important to recognize that the Great Depression itself was partly driven by the retelling of earlier depression stories. In the 1930s, there was incessant talk about the depressions of the 1870s and 1890s; each of those downturns lasted for the better part of a decade. Christina Romer, now the chairwoman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, has shown that the unemployment rate stayed above 10 percent for each of the five years from 1894 to 1898. 
 In his influential 1909 book, ''Forty Years of American Finance,'' Alexander Dana Noyes (who would later be financial editor of The New York Times) argued that the depressions of the 1870s and the 1890s might have lasted much longer, except for accidents of history -- a ''European famine and a bumper crop at home'' which stimulated the domestic economy through its agricultural sector. 
 EARLY in the Great Depression, people were concerned that, as one observer put it in 1931, we may ''pass through a long period of mediocre business activity like that of the 1890s.'' 
 Also early in the Depression, Forrest Davis worried in ''What Price Wall Street?'' that weakness after the panic of 1907 might have led to a prolonged depression if not for the accident of the World War. In 1932, a review of this book in The Times lamented that Mr. Davis had given us ''no especial assurance that any of the traditional accidents can save us once more. The last war showed how terrible the next war will be.''
 Should President Obama have reinforced the Great Depression story? Perhaps he had to take that risk to promote the economic stimulus plan, and not just hope for some accident to save us. The story was already entrenched in our consciousness, and will be with us until we see a real, solid boost from the stimulus package and its likely successors.

HEADLINE: A Higher Price For Rate Locks

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
LOCKING in a mortgage rate gives borrowers some protection from sudden spikes in interest rates, which not only helps them save money over time but also provides peace of mind. 
 The credit crisis hasn't removed this option -- mortgage brokers and bank loan officers will still freeze rates on a loan. But borrowers looking for such guarantees these days face more hurdles and higher fees, especially if they need to lock in a rate for more than a month.
 The shift is part of the industry's more conservative business approach, said Michael Moskowitz, the chief executive of Equity Now, a mortgage broker and direct lender based in Manhattan. 
 Only a few years ago, Mr. Moskowitz said, ''during the last 'refi' boom, lenders were locking in people willy-nilly, no questions asked. But things have shifted, because lenders are more attuned to the bottom line.''
 Indeed, before the credit crisis, lenders were doing such brisk business that many of them seemed to care little if they spent time working on a loan that ultimately fell through. But because lending standards were so liberal, few loans actually did. 
 Loan officers will more carefully scrutinize applications now, to ensure that borrowers can qualify for a loan, according to Mr. Moskowitz and Matthew Hackett, Equity Now's underwriting manager.
 ''Nowadays,'' Mr. Hackett said, ''a high percentage of people don't have the income or assets or equity in their homes to qualify for a mortgage.''
 He says he requires a recent pay stub to help prove a borrower's income. And a pay stub showing big overtime payments may not help much, he added, because companies are likely to cut back on overtime pay as the recession deepens. 
 Before the credit crunch, an oral estimate of borrowers' earnings and home values was often enough for many lenders and brokers. 
 Mr. Hackett says he also conducts an informal appraisal of the home's value before offering to lock in a rate. Lenders typically rely on industry sources for such information, though they will sometimes also check online sites like Zillow.com or Realtor.com to create rough estimates.
 The cost of a rate lock is usually built into the lender's fee, which is expressed in ''points.'' An up-front charge, a point is equal to 1 percent of the loan amount. For a 30-year mortgage of $250,000, for instance, Equity Now's borrowers with good credit would have received an interest rate of 5.125 percent earlier this month and would have paid a point, or $2,500, to lock that rate for 30 days. 
 Thirty days is usually enough time for borrowers and lenders to compile and process the documents needed to complete a loan. But Mr. Hackett says more complicated loans, like those involving co-ops, can often take longer. This is also the case, he said, for so-called consolidation and extension mortgage agreements, used by those who are refinancing their loans.
 Before the credit crisis deepened last year, Mr. Hackett said, borrowers would have paid 1.25 points to guarantee an interest rate for 60 days. Now, he said, the price is 1.75 points. 
 Consumers can help avoid delays, and more costly rate locks, Mr. Hackett said, by gathering their W-2 documents from employers from the last two years, plus a pay stub. 
 ''You'll get locked much quicker that way,'' he said.
 Debra Killian, the chief executive of Charter Oak Lending Group, a mortgage brokerage in Danbury, Conn., says she gathers full loan applications from clients, who then wait for rates to drop into a comfortable range before committing. ''I've got 40 files sitting here, waiting,'' she said.
 She noted that some lenders recently started charging an extra half point to lock a rate beyond 15 days on refinance loans, and an extra point to lock a rate for 45 days. 
 And if rates happen to fall while the application is being processed? Borrowers are still required to accept the rate they locked in. They can go elsewhere, and forfeit any fees already paid, but in the current economic climate, there is no guarantee that their new application will get approved.

HEADLINE: The Cost of a Haircut, the Sound of the Subway

 BODY:
In Praise
 Of Glossy Hair
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Women, Haircuts and the Price of Self-Esteem'' (Dispatches, Feb. 15), about the economic slowdown's impact on stylists and their customers: 
 As an Episcopal priest, I am a public figure. Like Ann Snitow, a professor and customer quoted in the column, I also advocate for women as a teacher and author. I have had my hair cut and highlighted at Marie Bove Salon since graduating from college 25 years ago. 
 To embrace fully Christian simplicity of life and feminism or have impressive hair? I'll say this: John Updike made me a minor character in his short story ''Varieties of Religious Experience,'' about the faith responses of people affected by 9/11. He described me as ''the minister, a short young woman wearing a bell of glossy hair.''
 The Rev. K. Jeanne Person
 Fiske Terrace, Brooklyn
 The author is the associate rector of the Church of the Holy Trinity in Yorkville.
 To the Editor:
 After spending more than $200 for a cut and color at Carol Bowden Salon in Chelsea, I was reassured by the column that my expenditure was not extravagant. While I admire those Bohemian New York women who have sufficient moxie to grow their hair long and defiantly gray, my own choice is well trimmed and eternally dark brown. 
 It's not a matter of vanity, as the column makes clear. It's part of professional self-presentation in Manhattan. And at a good salon, you get conversation and conviviality along with your haircut, a combination that's a distinct boost to morale.
 Eileen Pollock
 Upper West Side
 To the Editor:
 The only thing a smart, industrious woman in search of self-esteem and noticeable savings need do is learn how to cut her own hair. 
 I have never succumbed to a professional haircut, and last time I checked, I seemed to be doing just fine. I also sew and repair my own clothes and brush and clean my own carpets, on bended knee.
 What is it with these otherwise highly capable women who seem unable to do anything with their own (perhaps over-manicured) hands anymore?
 Fiona Bayly
 Upper East Side
 The Music
 Of the F Train
 To the Editor:
 Those notes that some subway trains play as they head out of the station (F.Y.I., Feb. 15) predate Leonard Bernstein's ''Somewhere.'' They're also the principal notes of the first theme of the second movement of Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto. Give a listen: About 30 seconds into it, you'll hear the F train as it pulls away from 42nd Street.
 Daniel Okrent
 Upper West Side
 On Paying Ads
 And Poetry
 To the Editor:
 Re the F.Y.I. report on Feb. 15 about revenue from advertising on buses and in subways and stations:
 One would think that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's own advertising and messages on most trains should factor in. If that space was sold to groups who would pay for it, it could bring in a substantial amount. 
 I'd rather see the authority eliminate things like ''Poetry in Motion'' and other unnecessary uses of space than raise the fare. Doreen Bartholomew

HEADLINE: Filmmaking at 90 Miles Per Hour

BYLINE: By DAVE KEHR

 BODY:
IT had been 38 years since William Friedkin last trained a camera on the boxy red-brick apartment complex on Stillwell Avenue, just a few blocks north of the Coney Island boardwalk in Brooklyn. But on a bright, windy day last spring, Mr. Friedkin was back with a crew -- shooting high-definition video this time -- to revisit the fictional residence of the New York police detective Popeye Doyle, the character played by Gene Hackman in Mr. Friedkin's 1971 film, ''The French Connection.''
 ''It looks like a prison,'' Mr. Friedkin said, remembering why he selected this building to be Popeye's home; that, and the fact that it adjoins the Bay 50th Street station of the Stillwell elevated train line, the jumping off point of possibly the most electrifying chase sequence in movie history. 
 The reason for Mr. Friedkin's return was to shoot some supplementary material for the Blu-ray edition of ''The French Connection,'' which Fox Home Entertainment will release on Tuesday (along with its 1975 sequel, ''French Connection II,'' directed by John Frankenheimer). Walking his young crew members through the setup to the chase scene Mr. Friedkin effortlessly remembered exactly where he'd positioned his camera all those years ago. Here, he said, is where Popeye enters the courtyard; here's where he takes cover behind a tree when a bullet meant for him strikes a bystander; here's where he jumps a railing to climb the stairs to the roof; where he sees the sniper (Marcel Bozzuffi) already at ground level, running for a train. 
 At 73 Mr. Friedkin has hair touched with gray, and his trademark glasses are a bit bigger than they used to be, but the famous Friedkin intensity -- his Hollywood nickname was Hurricane Billy -- seems almost undiminished. 
 But ''I was a different person then, really,'' he insisted. ''I was like Popeye, obsessed. All I cared about was getting the shot that I had in my head.'' 
 Mr. Friedkin was a rising young filmmaker with four features (his unlikely debut was the 1967 Sonny and Cher vehicle, ''Good Times'') and several documentaries to his credit when the producer Philip D'Antoni approached him about ''The French Connection.'' The story, essentially true, was derived from a book by Robin Moore that described how two narcotics detectives, Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, broke up a drug smuggling ring in the early 1960s, resulting in a record seizure: 120 pounds of heroin, worth more than $32 million. 
 ''We felt, at the time, that the story had everything for a great police thriller except for one thing, and that was a great action scene,'' Mr. Friedkin said. ''Because it was mostly about an investigation that took place between 1960 and 1962, it was mostly listening in on wiretaps, following guys. There was no action. It was all police work.''
 As the producer of ''Bullitt'' (1968), with its famous car chase through San Francisco, Mr. D'Antoni knew something about the importance of action. Joining Mr. Friedkin in Brooklyn for the DVD shoot, Mr. D'Antoni reminded him about a brainstorming session: ''I remember meeting you at your apartment, and we went for a walk, maybe 50 blocks. And somewhere along the line an elevated train went by. You said, what about doing this? We got so excited we raced back to Ernest Tidyman, who was our screenwriter, and page by page we gave him our version of what the chase would be like. Later, when you shot it, it was changed three times again.''
 The concept evolved into a parallel setup: as the sniper commandeered a train on the tracks above, forcing the motorman to drive at top speed, Popeye would hijack a passing car on the avenue below, and try to head the train off at the next station. 
 The car was driven by Bill Hickman, a veteran stunt coordinator who died in 1986. ''Bill Hickman drove the car at 90 miles an hour,'' Mr. Friedkin recalled. ''I was in the back seat holding a camera over his shoulder, focused on the street ahead. There was a camera in the front seat looking out the window, and another one on the front bumper. The reason I handled the camera was because the camera operator and the director of photography both had families with children, and I didn't.''
 Riding in the shotgun seat was Randy Jurgensen, a police officer moonlighting as a technical advisor for the film. (Later Mr. Friedkin would base ''Cruising'' on one of Mr. Jurgensen's cases.) 
 ''We took off, with Billy telling Bill Hickman, 'Give it to me, come on, you can do it, show me!' '' Mr. Jurgensen said in an interview. ''We had a police siren on top that people could hear, so that those who were able to get out of the way, could.''
 There were no permits and no planning -- just sheer nerve. ''After 26 blocks, from Bay 50th to Bay 24th Street, I ran out of film, but I knew I had enough,'' Mr. Friedkin said. ''The fact that we never hurt anybody in the chase run, the way it was poised for disaster, this was a gift from the Movie God. Everything happened on the fly. We would never do this again. Nor should it ever be attempted in that way again.'' 
 Even with the master shot in the can, it took a lot more shooting, spread out over five weeks, to get the close-ups of Mr. Hackman and the exterior views that Mr. Friedkin and his editor, Jerry Greenberg, would massage into the final sequence. 
 As brilliantly executed as the chase scene is, it would mean little without the grindingly realistic context that Mr. Friedkin provided in his story, set in a New York City on the verge of economic collapse. ''I had made documentaries,'' he said, ''and I thought I could make a film out of the street.'' 
 The evocative locations were chosen with the help of Fat Thomas, a downtown bartender and New York character who was a friend of Mr. Friedkin's friend, the columnist Jimmy Breslin. For the dialogue Mr. Friedkin cocked an open ear to the contributions of his actors and, above all, his two technical advisors, Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, the detectives who had worked the original case. 
 ''We didn't really have a final script,'' Mr. Friedkin recalled. ''I would ask Eddie or Sonny, 'What would you say here, when you come into the bar?' Eddie would tell Hackman and me, and we'd shoot it.''
 If anything, the movie reined in Mr. Egan's outsize personality: Mr. Friedkin's original choice for the role was Jackie Gleason. ''But the studio wouldn't do it with Gleason,'' Mr. Friedkin said, ''Though if you knew Eddie Egan, as an actor, you'd say Gleason. He was a big, heavyset Irishman, dark and brooding, but funny.'' 
 Mr. Egan died in 1995, after enjoying a career playing variations on himself in movies (''Badge 373'') and television shows (''Police Story''). Mr. Grosso, the calmer, more conciliatory member of the team, continued to work as a technical advisor. 
 ''On the last day of 'The French Connection,' '' he recalled, ''Billy drove me over to the studio where Francis Ford Coppola was shooting 'The Godfather,' and convinced Francis to take me on.'' Today he is a partner in a busy independent television production company, Grosso-Jacobson Communications. 
 Mr. Friedkin remains an active director of movies (''Bug,'' 2006) and has developed a second career staging operas in the United States and Europe. (He recently withdrew from a La Scala adaptation of ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' citing problems with the libretto.) 
 But all these years later he still hasn't finished tinkering with ''The French Connection.'' The Blu-ray release offers a new transfer from the original negative, for which Mr. Friedkin has devised a different color palette, inspired by experimental work the cinematographer Oswald Morris had performed on John Huston's 1956 ''Moby Dick.'' The color now appears to be brushed on to what is essentially a high-grain, black-and-white image, giving the film a raw, chilly look. 
 ''There's a false impression that in the '70s we had all this freedom to do whatever we wanted, to experiment,'' Mr. Friedkin said, suggesting, in more colorful language, that the studio was on his case through the entire production. ''They wanted to fire me three or four times. The budget was $1.5 million, and the film ended up costing $1.8. In those days that didn't go down well.''
 The complaints stopped when ''The French Connection'' won five Oscars -- best picture, director, editing, actor and adapted screenplay -- and grossed nearly $80 million worldwide, according to a 1972 Variety article. Just more gifts from the Movie God, who has never stopped smiling on this little cop thriller.

HEADLINE: Start Up The Risk-Takers

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Reading the news that General Motors and Chrysler are now lining up for another $20 billion or so in government aid -- on top of the billions they've already received or requested -- leaves me with the sick feeling that we are subsidizing the losers and for only one reason: because they claim that their funerals would cost more than keeping them on life support. Sorry, friends, but this is not the American way. Bailing out the losers is not how we got rich as a country, and it is not how we'll get out of this crisis.
 G.M. has become a giant wealth- destruction machine -- possibly the biggest in history -- and it is time that it and Chrysler were put into bankruptcy so they can truly start over under new management with new labor agreements and new visions. When it comes to helping companies, precious public money should focus on start-ups, not bailouts. 
 You want to spend $20 billion of taxpayer money creating jobs? Fine. Call up the top 20 venture capital firms in America, which are short of cash today because their partners -- university endowments and pension funds -- are tapped out, and make them this offer: The U.S. Treasury will give you each up to $1 billion to fund the best venture capital ideas that have come your way. If they go bust, we all lose. If any of them turns out to be the next Microsoft or Intel, taxpayers will give you 20 percent of the investors' upside and keep 80 percent for themselves.
 If we are going to be spending billions of taxpayer dollars, it can't only be on office-decorating bankers, over-leveraged home speculators and auto executives who year after year spent more energy resisting changes and lobbying Washington than leading change and beating Toyota.
 I've been traveling all across the country on a book tour, and every evening I return to my hotel with my pockets full of business cards from inventors in clean energy. Our country is still bursting with innovators looking for capital. So, let's make sure all the losers clamoring for help don't drown out the potential winners who could lift us out of this. Some of our best companies, such as Intel, were started in recessions, when necessity makes innovators even more inventive and risk-takers even more daring.
 Yes, we have to shore up the banking system, which underpins everything; and finding a fair way to prevent hardworking people, who played by the rules, from losing their homes to foreclosure is both right and essential for stability. 
 But beyond that, let's think, talk and plan in more aspirational ways. We're down, but we're not out. As we invest taxpayer money, let's do it with an eye to starting a new generation of biotech, info-tech, nanotech and clean-tech companies, with real innovators, real 21st-century jobs and potentially real profits for taxpayers. Our motto should be, ''Start-ups, not bailouts: nurture the next Google, don't nurse the old G.M.'s.'' 
 To be fair, the stimulus package that the Obama team and the Democrats in Congress recently passed -- with virtually no Republican help -- goes some way toward doing just that. Hat's off for that. Now let's do more.
 The renewable-energy business -- wind, solar and solar thermal -- was almost dead in this country. Most new projects stopped last fall because they depended for their financing on selling their renewable energy tax credits to Wall Street firms. As those Wall Street firms went bust or suffered steep losses, they had no need for tax credits because they had no profits to offset. The stimulus package created a mechanism for renewable energy innovators to bypass Wall Street and monetize their tax credits directly through the U.S. Treasury, for any project that starts between now and the end of 2010. 
 The wind and solar industries in America ''were dead in the fourth quarter,'' said John Woolard, chief executive of BrightSource Energy, which builds and operates cutting-edge solar-thermal plants in the Mojave Desert. Almost five gigawatts of new solar-thermal projects -- the equivalent of five big nuclear plants -- at various stages of permitting were being held up because of a lack of financing.
 ''All of these projects will now go ahead,'' said Woolard. ''You are talking about thousands of jobs ... We really got something right in this legislation.''
 These jobs will be in engineering, constructing and operating huge solar systems and wind farms and manufacturing new photovoltaics. Together they will drive innovation in all these areas -- and move wind and solar technology down the cost-volume learning curve so they can compete against fossil fuels and become export industries at the ''ChinIndia price,'' that is the price at which they can scale in China and India. 
 That is how taxpayer money should be used to stimulate: limited financing, for a limited time, targeted on an industry bristling with new technology start-ups that, with a little push from Uncle Sam, won't just survive this crisis but help us thrive when it is over. We need, and the world needs, an America that is thriving not just surviving.

HEADLINE: Financial Problems Shut Down Museum

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
The Sports Museum of America, which opened near Wall Street in May with high expectations and the sight of stars like Eli Manning and Walt Frazier waving red foam fingers, shut down after business Friday.
 ''The board of directors voted to cease operations last night, but I'm hoping it's not the end,'' Philip Schwalb, the museum's founder and a board member, said Friday. 
 The $93 million for-profit museum, at 26 Broadway, had exclusive relationships with more than 60 sports halls of fame and other organizations, and was the home to the Heisman Trophy and the Billie Jean King International Women's Sports Center. 
 The museum suspended payments late last year on $57 million in tax-free Liberty bonds, which were intended to assist an economic rebound in Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. An additional $36 million in private money was raised.
 The museum was on track to draw 125,000 visitors, well below projections of one million before it opened. Schwalb said the museum could have survived with 275,000. Over the past year, it cut its top ticket price to $16 from $27 and laid off employees.
 He said the recession was far less a problem than a $6 million construction cost overrun that forced the museum to severely cut marketing. He said an ill-conceived ad campaign resulted in ''95 percent of residents of New York City never hearing of us.'' 
 Schwalb said that for the past six weeks, after efforts to restructure the bond debt failed, the board tried to sell the museum for $10 million, one-tenth of the total cost of the venture, including seed money that was invested earlier. 
 He said the deal now being offered is an 85 percent stake in the museum, with the rest retained by the original equity investors. He said he would prefer that the old investors retain 25 percent. Schwalb was the original chief executive, but the board asked him to surrender the role last year.
 Unsuccessful acquisition talks were held, he said, with Magic Johnson Enterprises and a small group of the original investors. 
 ''I think we'll have to sell within about three weeks,'' Schwalb said. ''The concept is still strong and the subject matter is as compelling as the Museum of Arts and Design in Columbus Circle, and it's not in the middle of Times Square, either.'' 
 The arts and design museum opened in September.
 David Warburg, the lead lawyer on the unsuccessful effort to restructure the debt, said the museum would probably liquidate its assets and return memorabilia to the owners. He said that Schwalb ''never appeared with any investor that was concrete and quite frankly, he didn't do much to advance things.''
 Schwalb's plan from its earliest conception was to create a Smithsonian-like museum of sports that would be more central to fans and tourists than individual halls of fame. 
 He said he believed that the site, near the site of the World Trade Center and where tourists head to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, was as viable as that of the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum at 12th Avenue and 46th Street, or the Bodies exhibition at the South Street Seaport. But the sports museum was not in a stand-alone building; it is inside the old Standard Oil building and lacks the exterior signage that would define it as a major attraction.
 The museum's demise is likely to make the Heisman Trophy an orphan again. The Downtown Athletic Club, its longtime former home, shut its doors after the 9/11 attacks. A large gallery in the museum is devoted to the Heisman and its history.
 Bill Dockery, the president of the Heisman Trophy Trust, said: ''We're disappointed and find it unfortunate that the traffic flow didn't allow the museum to continue as it was expected. A new buyer would be fine if they treat the Heisman with integrity. I know Philip had his heart in this, and I'm sure this is taking a lot out of him.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Seats at a Table Where Space Can Seem Elusive

BYLINE: By GREGORY BEYER

 BODY:
CHEESE sandwiches, homemade chocolate truffles, a haircut, a hem: These are some of the things you can get at the Essex Street Market. 
 But it's the matter of how vendors get space in the market that has recently raised questions at this vibrant indoor bazaar at Essex and Delancey Streets on the Lower East Side. There the city's Economic Development Corporationleases space at an average rate of $34 a square foot, an attractive price to vendors. 
 Merchants can apply online. The city considers the applicant's business plan and how the business would affect the market's mix of products. Qualified applicants who cannot be immediately accommodated are placed on a waiting list.
 But there is another way to gain entry to the market, one not mentioned on its Web site. This involves buying out the lease of a vendor who already has space in the market, just like subletting an apartment.
 A spokeswoman for the corporation, which has operated the market since the early 1990s, said this route was acceptable, adding that her agency reviewed a transfer request with the same criteria used to evaluate new applications.
 But the corporation is currently reviewing this policy, responding to a request from Community Board 3. Last month, the board urged the city to clarify the application process out of concern that the system did not give equal opportunity to all potential vendors, a particular issue for those who would otherwise struggle to pay the neighborhood's high rents.
 ''It's really necessary for everyone to be treated the same,'' said Susan Stetzer, the board's district manager. ''Where is the transparency? And where does the wait list play into this?''
 Lyn Pentecost, the executive director of the Lower Eastside Girls Club, asked herself those very questions when she applied for a booth in 2007. 
 Ms. Pentecost said she couldn't understand why her name remained on the waiting list even as several booths became available. Eventually, she said, a vendor suggested she might be able to expedite the process by offering money to a vendor. Choosing not to go that route, she stayed on the list for nearly a year. Her organization's shop, which sells baked goods and crafts, opened last April.
 Since complaining to the city and the community board, Ms. Pentecost said in an e-mail message, the girls' club has received threatening notes from vendors who, as she put it, ''feel we have 'stolen' their right to transfer their leases (for cash).''
 Of those vendors, Ms. Pentecost said, ''My feeling is that they have no right to sell city equity, particularly as it is heavily subsidized to start with.''
 Other vendors shrugged off the complaint, among them Jeffrey Ruhalter, a butcher who owns Jeffrey's Meat Market, which his grandfather opened on the same spot in 1939. 
 ''People on the waiting list are waiting for an open spot,'' Mr. Ruhalter said. ''But if someone decides, 'Hey, I want this guy's business,' that's a transaction between them.''

HEADLINE: Rescue Flight

BYLINE: By JON MOOALLEM. 
Jon Mooallem, a contributing writer, last wrote for the magazine about environmentally friendly house deconstruction.

 BODY:
 1.
 People started gathering at the Lighthouse Missionary Baptist Church in southwestern Kentucky before sunrise. First there were just a few, sealed in their cars with the heat blasting, but before long there were close to 100, standing in the parking lot in multiple coats. It was the first Friday in December, 23 degrees at dawn and nearly windless. Everyone was looking up. 
 Operation Migration's four ultralight planes floated into view over some oak and maple trees, then passed over the small, white chapel. An ultralight is powered by a massive rear propeller. In the sky, it looks like a scaled-down Formula 1 car dangling under the wing of a hang glider. Because the little planes taxi on three wheels, pilots call them trikes. At 200 feet, the first pilot, Chris Gullikson, was perfectly visible in his trike's open cockpit. He was wearing his whooping-crane costume, a white hooded helmet and white gown that looked like a cross between a beekeeping suit and a Ku Klux Klan get-up. Gullikson and the other trike pilots were going to pick up the 14 juvenile whooping cranes that they were, little by little, leading south for the winter. Traditionally, and for many millenniums, cranes learned to migrate by following other cranes. But traditions have changed. Outside the church, a plucky, silver-haired woman named Liz Condie was explaining to the spectators why, exactly, her team has had to dress up and step in.
 For the last eight years, Operation Migration has been one of several organizations collectively trying to bring whooping cranes back to the eastern part of the continent. The whooping crane is reclusive and headstrong -- it demands a square mile around its nest to itself -- and consequently was one of the first birds to suffer as humans crowded into North America. In a 1946 article in The New York Times, a spokesman for the U.S. Wildlife Service, which was then going through considerable trouble on the species's behalf -- much of it for naught -- called the whooping crane ''intolerant of civilization.'' The article went on to blame the crane's ''lack of cooperation'' for its looming extinction.
 But the birds' uncompromising wildness ''is part of their majesty,'' Joe Duff, Operation Migration's co-founder and a trike pilot, told me not long ago. Thus, re-establishing the species presents a challenge: how can humans intervene to breed and teach the birds what they'll need to survive without also wearing away those birds' natural apprehension of people; without inadvertently building a race of whooping cranes that feels comfortable hanging out on golf courses and in schoolyards and the fetid little ponds around retirement communities? The birds would most likely find people in those places eager to feed them, and suddenly, you'd have whooping cranes that are hardly wild or majestic, but more like the irascible geese parked on the lawns of suburban courthouses -- except that a goose, Duff told me, doesn't jump into the air and rake forward with its long talons when it feels cornered. How, then, do you restore wildlife without simultaneously taming it? One way is to do it in disguise. 
 From the time Operation Migration's cranes hatch at the federal government's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland, and for the rest of their lives, every effort is made to keep them from acclimating to humans or encountering even the slightest sign of them. Workers never speak around the cranes, and they always wear the same white costumes. They use a small crane-head puppet slipped over one hand to teach the chicks how to peck and forage. Gradually, the cranes ''imprint'' on the costume, accepting whoever is wearing it as the dominant bird in their cohort. 
 The chicks are then shipped to the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in Wisconsin for ''flight training.'' Like many species, whooping cranes learn to migrate only by following their parents. They have no inborn understanding of where to go, and if no older birds are around to show them, they'll just stay put. So the ultralight and its costumed pilot are introduced as a proxy. While still in their eggs, these cranes were played recordings of a trike engine, attuning them to it as a pseudo-parental presence. Now in Wisconsin, they spend their first summer learning to run, then fly, behind the aircraft. By fall, the whole entourage sets off for Florida, and Operation Migration takes its stage-managed show on the road.
 The journey from Wisconsin to Florida is 1,285 miles long. Wild cranes can do it in as little as a week, swirling up to 8,000 or 10,000 feet on columns of rising air and coasting for miles. But the human-led migration takes longer -- last year, it took more than three months. Trikes can't keep up with the birds at such high altitudes, so they stay closer to the ground and force the birds to flap the whole way. And both the trikes and the cranes have fussy, sometimes opposing, requirements about what times of day and kinds of weather they'll fly in. This year, Operation Migration left Wisconsin on Oct. 17. It was now Dec. 5, and they'd only managed to fly on 10 of the 49 days in between. They'd been grounded at this stopover in Kentucky for six days, by headwinds of up to 40 miles per hour, and they were still shy of the route's halfway point. 
 2.
 A voice broke in on Condie's radio, and she narrated for the crowd outside the church. ''O.K., they're off and in the air, folks. We had one reluctant bird. No. 827 was the last one out of the pen.'' 
 ''He wanted to stay at my house!'' a woman in the parking lot cried. Her name was Martha, and she owned the soybean field where the cranes had been hidden all week. Last spring, two team members showed up at her door with a satellite photo of her land, asking her to volunteer it as a stopover point. 
 Operation Migration relies exclusively on such hospitality. The organization, a nonprofit on an unforgiving $700,000 budget, gets almost no government money and so is left to scrape up the majority of its financing from individual donors. A cult of these so-called Craniacs now reads the crew's daily journal religiously at OperationMigration.org, following the team and its numbered cranes like the cast of a reality show. (After Condie's announcement, one woman explained to me that 827 is known for being ''very independent.'') Along the route, well-wishers also bring the crew comfort food: very heavy hams, pots of chili. Already that morning, Condie was handed three batches of homemade fudge, several dozen donuts and a carrot cake. ''Everybody puts on 10 pounds on migration,'' she said later with a laugh. No one ever thinks to bring them a big salad.
 The early-morning flyovers are the only opportunity for the Craniacs to even see the birds. The cranes must be moved from the refuge in Wisconsin to two refuges in Florida as furtively as fine art is moved between museums. From the time they land at each stopover to the time they can take off again, the cranes are stashed in a camouflage pen, tucked out of view and ringed by two electric fences. Costumed workers feed them twice a day, but otherwise the area is off-limits and resolutely guarded from trespassers, hunters, journalists and dogs. Martha (Operation Migration asked that I not disclose her full name) was sworn to secrecy, but it didn't take. ''This has been wonderful,'' she loudly told acquaintances outside the chapel. ''The best week of my life.''
 Condie kept fielding questions from the crowd. ''You only have to show the birds the way once,'' she explained. After following the trikes their first year, the cranes continue migrating back and forth on their own each spring and fall. That very morning, in fact, graduates of the team's seven previous ultralight-led migrations -- 73 cranes in all -- were scattered up and down the eastern flyway, at various points on their passage to Florida. Also scattered up and down the flyway were biologists -- lots of biologists -- from Operation Migration's many partner organizations, tracking the radio signals emitted from those birds' leg bands. And now that Operation Migration's current class of cranes were airborne, its crew would hit the road, too, chasing the migration to its next stop in two motor homes, two pickups towing campers, and two vans, one towing a 50-foot supply trailer with a spare aircraft. All told, seven state and federal agencies and two nonprofits with an annual collective budget of $1.7 million in public and private funds were hard at work, fulfilling humankind's responsibility to a bird that we've defibrillated out of near-certain extinction and gotten breathing again, if not yet absolutely saved. 
 The whooping crane, David S. Wilcove, a Princeton ecologist, told me recently, ''is just about the most charismatic endangered species in America.'' By 1941, only 21 wild ones remained. Today there are 381, enough to make it one of the most uplifting success stories in a field where the bar is admittedly sinking rather low. By now, one biologist told me, ''work on any endangered species is certainly a very severe, rear-guard effort.'' Twelve percent of the world's bird species are threatened with extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature -- so are a fifth of all mammals, and almost a third of all amphibians. In other words, we've backed ourselves into a corner, and sustaining the world's wildlife will require progressively more systemic interventions from here on out. ''Many of those species, probably most of them,'' Wilcove said, ''are in a certain sense wards of the state. Now and for the foreseeable future, they will be dependent on humans for their survival.'' 
 Operation Migration exemplifies the kind of ingenious, unwavering work that needs to be done -- and that we'll need to keep doing, maybe forever, even as the strenuous administrative challenge of micromanaging so much of the natural world begins to blur the line between conservation and domestication. Already, it has come to this on planet Earth: men dressed like birds, teaching birds to fly.
 3.
 The hum of the trike engines swelled into a buzz. Then the lead pilot, Chris Gullikson, reappeared in the sky, drawing a lopsided V of tremendous white shapes behind his wingtips. As the parade of birds and machines coasted over the chapel and the three large wooden crosses driven into the ground beside it, people raised their binoculars and cameras to their faces and tilted back their heads. ''It looks like a revival from up here, Liz,'' a voice quipped in Condie's radio. It was Jack Wrighter, one of the retired commercial pilots who flies top cover for the migration in his Cessna 172.
 ''There's not a biologist among us,'' Joe Duff told me later. (There is, however, a metal sculptor, a former butterfly breeder and Gullikson, who splits the rest of his year between leading adventure tourists into tornadoes and designing English-style riding saddles.) Duff, who is now 59, was a photographer in Toronto when, in 1993, he helped another ultralight hobbyist and artist named William Lishman -- the first person to fly with birds -- lead 18 Canada geese on a migration from Ontario to Virginia. ''The whole idea was to use this technique for endangered species,'' Duff told me. Soon the two men started practicing by costume-rearing nonendangered sandhill cranes and then migrating with them.
 The nonprofit International Crane Foundation had been costume-rearing sandhills experimentally at the Necedah refuge in Wisconsin since a biologist named Rob Horwich devised the process there in 1985 as a tool for eventually reintroducing endangered crane species. Horwich theorized that crane chicks are similar to human infants, clinging to a parental figure who tutors or reassures them at various periods in their development. ''Because of those periods,'' Horwich told me, ''you can have a tremendous amount of control over the animal.''
 In the 1980s, Horwich led his sandhills around Necedah on foot, always in costume. As they made their first attempts at flight, he ran ahead of them like a boy launching a kite. But a decade later, Lishman and Duff were flying their sandhills outside the bubble of a refuge, and this meant having to fight even harder to keep them away from anything or anyone uncranelike. ''It just kept getting more complicated,'' Duff told me. A hinge on the pen might break in some farmer's field, but ''you can't fix it, can't bring a drill out there,'' without someone in costume first walking the cranes a half-mile away, out of earshot. After five years they had honed a strict and effective protocol, and in 1998, Duff presented their work to the International Whooping Crane Recovery Team, the partnership of Canadian and American biologists charged by the two governments with reviving the species. ''We were basically trying to ask the federal government to give us one of their most endangered species so we can dress up in a costume and lead it halfway across the country,'' Duff recalled. ''With a puppet.''
 The whooping crane is the largest North American bird. It stands five feet tall and has a stiletto beak and a raspy call that carries for two or more miles. It is not particularly nice. (Operation Migration's intern last year was short and unassuming, and whenever she suited up and got in the pen, Duff says, ''the birds used to whale on her.'') The bird nests in marshes and all but vanished as the wetlands running down the center of the continent were drained for agriculture in the 1800s. The crane's size, elusiveness and abrasive voice also seem to have made it a particularly satisfying trophy for hunters. (Washington Post headline, 1904: ''Two Nebraska Duck Hunters Kill the Last of the Pompous Bird.'') It was one of the original species listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1973, when only a single migratory population of about 50 birds remained. Since then, staunch protection of its breeding grounds on the border of Alberta and the Northwest Territories and its wintering grounds on the Gulf Coast of Texas have allowed that lone, wild population to rebound. It is now up to 265 birds, an extraordinary turnaround but still not enough to give solid odds for the species' long-term survival. So for 30 years, biologists have been trying to bolster that population by setting up a second, separate one. Operation Migration and its partners, known as the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership, are just the latest chapter in that effort.
 Reintroducing endangered species is rarely easy. Wild whooping cranes have evolved over 60 million years. There is no blueprint for engineering one in captivity, no key that might elucidate which of its behaviors are hard-wired genetically and which ones it must be taught. In 1975, biologists tried, essentially, to outsource the job of teaching cranes to survive in the wild. They replaced the eggs under female sandhill cranes in Idaho with whooping-crane eggs, hoping the sandhills would foster those chicks through maturity. They didn't anticipate that the whooping-crane chicks would grow up sexually attracted to the species of bird that raised them and not to other whooping cranes. This confusion led to few new whooping cranes, though the birds did manage to produce one aberrant ''whoop-hill'' hybrid.
 The biologists next tried to build a nonmigratory population. Beginning in 1993, juveniles costume-reared in Maryland were released on protected land in central Florida. Very quickly, however, bobcats and alligators devoured a great percentage of them. Eventually, the scientists realized that the birds weren't roosting in water at night the way wild cranes do -- a habit that allows them to hear the splashes of approaching predators. Apparently, this was a learned behavior, too. So back in Maryland, the biologists built new pens with ponds in them and started leading the cranes inside at sundown, propping up a whooping crane mannequin in each pond as a role model. 
 This helped, but once released in Florida, hundreds of birds were still eaten or died after ingesting stray metal objects, and the ones that did survive failed to produce chicks. Necropsies found that 10 percent or more had deformed reproductive organs -- no one is exactly sure why. Last fall, after 15 years, the recovery team decided to stop shipping whooping cranes to Florida, shifting those resources instead to the more promising ultralight-migration program. Besides, projections showed development shrinking the nonmigratory birds' habitat in Florida radically in the next 50 years. ''We just didn't pick a good spot,'' Tom Stehn, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist who is a chairman of the joint American-Canadian recovery effort, told me. ''The question is, Is there a good spot left in the United States?''
 Compared with these past efforts, the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership has been an almost unthinkable success. It has also proved to be an awareness-raising juggernaut, with a sexiness that's hard to come by for conservationists; the ultralight-led migration is covered in hundreds of local media outlets along its route and is a huge hit in classrooms. There is a serious problem, however: The whooping-crane population that the partnership has toiled to build up in the eastern United States has shown virtually no ability to sustain itself so far. The birds are abandoning their nests on the Wisconsin refuge, leaving their eggs to be eaten. It's not clear why, but it may be that an infestation of black flies is harassing the birds, and they're just getting fed up and walking away.
 Whooping cranes don't typically reproduce until they are 5 years old. But after seven years of guided migrations, Operation Migration's cranes have successfully fledged only one chick, and biologists are concerned. The population is growing every year, but only because humans are rearing more birds in captivity, teaching them to migrate and putting them out there. Duff is confident the problem can be solved, whatever's causing it, and that someday -- when new generations of birds start materializing in Wisconsin and are led south by their parents -- Operation Migration's work won't be necessary anymore. ''I do anticipate that it's going to work eventually, otherwise I wouldn't bother,'' he said. ''But I don't think it's going to be as easy as we thought when we started.''
 4.
 After flying over the church, Chris Gullikson climbed with the birds to 2,000 feet, where the air was frigid but calm. He managed to lead the migration past its next planned stopover to the following one, a gated wildlife sanctuary in Hardin County, Tenn. It was a gain of 120 miles. A costumed pilot walked the birds down to a creek, allowing the crew to drive in and set up the pen. (After touching down, the pilots communicate by text message, setting their phones to vibrate.) The crew set up its camp on the opposite end of the property, then took turns showering and doing laundry in the sanctuary's guest home. The owners had set out stacks of Domino's pizzas and some Miller Lite for dinner.
 The next morning, Richard van Heuvelen took his turn as lead pilot. The whooping cranes were hidden in the crook of a grassy, bean-shaped field. It was surrounded by pines and looked like part of a golf course. As van Heuvelen descended and swept around the back of the pen, the mob of birds rushed to follow the sound of his engine, the way dogs race along a chain-link fence when a car passes. He landed 100 yards from the pen door. Then he revved his engine, blasted an MP3 of a whooping crane call from a bullhorn on his rear axle and took off.
 The door opened, and the cranes swept out in a rowdy blur. They formed a perpendicular line behind him, rising neck and neck, then rapidly sorted themselves into a V, 11 on one side and 2 on the other. This, once again, left crane No. 827 still inside the pen. (''Performance anxiety'' is how one of the ground crew later explained it.) A costumed operative was hunched nearby, ready to lurch out under a giant, crinkly green tarp and scare the bird into the air, should the pilots call for the Swamp Monster.
 ''It's a little rough down here, and they can't climb,'' van Heuvelen said over the radio. As soon as he turned south, onto the migration's route and into a 12-mile-per-hour headwind, the flock fell out of alignment and scattered behind him. The headwind was not awful but strong enough that even if the birds could be persuaded to fly into it, they might not have the stamina to reach the next stopover, 57 miles away. 
 By this time, 827 had been jolted into the air, but he was lingering over a remote stand of conifers. Duff's trike swept in to pick up the bird, but he ended up having to speed up and bolt by 827 to shake off a stall. 
 ''One's breaking off to the right,'' another pilot, Brooke Pennypacker, soon radioed. ''Do you see that one, Joe?'' 
 ''I see it,'' Duff said. He had 827 lodged behind his left wing now and rocketed in to pick off this second drifter. 
 Meanwhile, a quarter-mile to the west, a thousand feet up, van Heuvelen was engaged in something akin to crane herding. He kept swooping under, and virtually through, the ragged white cloud of birds, putting his wingtip right in front of the cranes and hoping, again and again, to emerge with a neater arrangement filed behind him. Sometimes it worked, but as soon as he turned into the wind, the cranes would reshuffle and flap away. After half an hour, he turned back to the pen. Having traded the headwind for a tailwind, the cranes immediately locked behind him in a tight diagonal. He landed in the field, and the birds gladly shuffled back into the pen. Then the pilots headed for the hangar. The airport manager had sent out to Hardee's for a big breakfast of sausage-and-egg biscuits to console them.

 As hard as it is to create cranes that will survive in the wild, making sure there is suitable wilderness to put them in may be harder. Globally, loss of habitat is the grimmest threat to endangered species, and it is no longer enough to simply seal off the habitat that's left. Those ecosystems also must be managed as assiduously as the animals themselves.
 Having disrupted natural fire cycles, we're forced to suppress fires in some areas and set them in others. We control predators, mop up pollution or clear out invasive species. We slip contraceptives to overpopulations of deer and the plague vaccine to ferrets; call in sharpshooters in helicopters to assassinate every last feral pig from certain islands; teach California condors not to perch on power lines; pick up migrating salamanders and carry them safely across a California road; and install feeders to satiate the Devil's Hole pupfish, a species of small blue fish that lives exclusively in a particular pool of warm water in the Nevada desert. ''If humans had the inclination to give up, this would be the one species given up on,'' Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, says of the pupfish. ''You could say it wouldn't matter -- it has very few ecological interactions with anything else in the world. But just the opposite has happened. I think we've got a very unshakable ethic to prevent extinction in this country.
 ''A term that has come into use in the last couple of years is 'conservation-reliant species,' '' Suckling went on. ''These are species that we can reintroduce successfully, but they'll forever require active management.'' They will last, in other words, as long as we keep rigging the world around them in their favor.
 The term was proposed in a 2005 paper by a United States Geological Survey wildlife biologist named J. Michael Scott and several colleagues, including David S. Wilcove of Princeton. By now, Scott told me, it's clear that the notion that we can roll up our sleeves, neutralize the threats to a species and walk away ''is a flawed assumption.'' According to data from the Fish and Wildlife Service, only 16 of the roughly 1,350 species in the United States ever listed under the Endangered Species Act have been recovered fully enough to be delisted, but only 9 have been allowed to go extinct. We should accept that, in many cases, shepherding a species to the point in between -- keeping it conservation-reliant -- is the only reasonable vision of success. It's a concession, Scott said, that ''right now, nature is unable to stand on its own.''
 It's difficult to imagine what a world of conservation-reliant wildlife might look like, how far we'll go to prop up species in landscapes that have become drastically different from the ones they evolved to thrive in. Scott mentioned the example of the Columbia River, where endangered salmon are carried around hydroelectric dams in barges and where sea lions trying to eat the fish have been hazed with rubber bullets. His point was that we're managing to balance the salmon's needs and ours -- including our need to keep salmon living in the Columbia River and not have the undoing of that particular facet of creation on our conscience. Then again, Scott added, with enough creativity and hard work, ''I could keep polar bears in San Diego if I really wanted to.''
 Eighty percent of the species on the endangered list are conservation-reliant, and the list is growing. Moreover, a study by Wilcove estimated that the actual number of endangered species in the United States is, conservatively, between 14,000 and 35,000 -- the vast majority haven't been studied closely enough or generated enough concern to get on the list. As Scott told me, if we want to preserve even some of them, and most of those turn out to be conservation-reliant, we're talking about having to manually override a huge amount of the machinery of the natural world. Scientists and grad students will have to fan out, tending our Devil's Hole pupfish and their habitat over here, and our whooping cranes and their habitats over there -- fastidiously gardening the wilderness. ''We're in this for the long haul,'' he said. ''It's the full-employment act.''
 6.
 Even as the recovery team jump-starts a new population of whooping cranes in the East, threats are gathering around the longstanding population of wild birds. Water is being diverted from the river that feeds the birds' wintering grounds in Texas toward the ballooning San Antonio area. This, scientists at Fish and Wildlife believe, has raised the salinity of the refuge's wetlands, reducing the population of blue crabs, the cranes' main food source. Meanwhile, ponds of toxic tailings from the tar-sands industry are multiplying near the northern end of the crane's migratory corridor, in Canada. And 40,000 wind turbines are projected to rise up along the route. (Collisions with power lines are already the leading known killer of the cranes during migration.) Then there's climate change, which, among other things, is projected to put much of the crane's current protected habitat underwater.
 As our own population and its influence continues to expand, less free space remains for other species. ''The animals that survive and thrive are those that do well in and around a human-oriented landscape,'' John French, a U.S.G.S. biologist who oversees the whooping-crane research in Maryland, told me. The truest triumphs of conservation may be the species that rebound so phenomenally that they spill out of the refuges and recovery zones we set up for them and become a nuisance to us on our own turf, like the gray wolf, or the wild turkey and the white-tailed deer -- both of which, in the early 1900s, were assumed to be doomed in the Northeast.
 By now, French told me, the scientists overseeing the whooping-crane recovery are having a ''sometimes very heated debate about how wild we actually want these birds we release to be. Is that the best thing for them? In my opinion, it may not be.'' In other words, maybe the ''Truman Show'' existence that has been concocted for them isn't actually doing them any favors. Maybe the most useful skill we could teach whooping cranes is how to coexist with people -- if that's even possible. 
 Still, all of those involved with the recovery I spoke to were confident about their ability to get the species on solid footing in the near term. And yet they were also perfectly willing to look the more worrying, longer-term picture squarely in the face. 
 ''There's no hope for whooping cranes in the long term,'' Joe Duff told me back at the wildlife sanctuary in Tennessee, after that morning's false start. In fact, if he looked ahead 50 years, he didn't see hope for very much wildlife at all -- or, he added plaintively, for his daughter, who is now 9 years old. ''I think the world is facing a major crisis, and nobody cares,'' he said. ''I mean, we've left a mess. It's a mess, and I don't know what to do. Do you?'' 
 Wilcove calls the whooping-crane recovery team ''miracle workers,'' and the resurrection of the bird in North America, provisional as it still may be, is a heroic accomplishment -- and heroic in the somewhat Sisyphean way that any conservation work may be, since it requires rallying the will to build something you also realize the future is likely to erase. ''I feel like I'm doing something useful,'' Duff said. ''I'm doing something, and I don't know if it's going to work out or be worth anything, but at least we're trying. We try, and we educate and maybe -- I'm thinking pessimistically, but I'm trying to be positive,'' he went on. ''Maybe you preserve a little bit of wetlands for something -- and not just whooping cranes.'' Or, he added, ''maybe whooping cranes will survive when we don't.'' 
 That night, a belt of trashy air moved in. Then came a long chain of storms. Operation Migration wound up stuck in Hardin County for five more days. (The migration didn't finally wrap until Jan. 23, and the team arrived in Florida with its budget in the red; donations from Craniacs were drying up along with the rest of the economy.) 
 One afternoon at the sanctuary, a crew member named Beverly Paulan suited up to let the cranes out of their pen for some exercise. The birds rose over the grassy field, then turned south around a dogleg and disappeared behind the pines. After three, maybe four minutes, Paulan started to panic. What if the birds didn't return? But part of her, she later said, also wanted them to just keep going, hoping that they'd somehow figured out how to make it to Florida on their own. 
 She stood in her whooping-crane costume, flapping its wide, white sleeves. Then the birds came back.

HEADLINE: Trapped in Their Own Homes

BYLINE: By MARY JO PATTERSON

 BODY:
ON May 1, 2007, a very different economic era, Janet Faello put her former marital home on the market for $829,000. She and her husband were divorcing.
 It seemed like a good price for the house, a six-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath ranch in Dix Hills. But it didn't sell at that price, or at $750,000, where it landed six months later, or at $699,000, where it stands now. 
 ''It's not the Taj Mahal, but it's a nice, well-maintained home,'' said Ms. Faello, a 53-year-old massage therapist with two daughters in college who remains in the house, which she and her ex-husband still jointly own. Her ex-husband lives elsewhere. ''I haven't been entertained once with an offer, and I'm still not getting any bites.''
 With the house unsold, Ms. Faello said she and her ex-husband are struggling to meet expenses. Taxes alone are $13,860 a year. 
 ''I'm not ashamed to say to you, I have had to borrow money from my father,'' she said. ''We each want to move on. We're just hoping and praying things will turn around.''
 Would-be sellers in New York City's suburbs understand her pain, whether they are trying to sell a Cape Cod for $300,000 or a center hall Colonial for $1 million. In a housing market characterized by eroding home values, high inventory and tight credit for borrowers, many feel stuck in a place they don't want or can't afford. As the recession becomes more severe and unemployment mounts, they fret each week their properties remain unsold, and fear losing equity. While buyers hunt for exceptional values, sellers feel like hostages. And their pain is sometimes drawn out when deals that seem to be done blow up just before the closing.
 ''I have an offer and we've accepted it,'' said Ray Lopez of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., a manager for Metro-North Railroad who has been trying to sell his house since last March. Last year he signed a contract, but learned two weeks before the closing that the buyer could not get a mortgage. While he hopes the current deal will go through, he said he won't relax until three weeks after the closing. ''Anything could happen,'' he said. ''You don't know till you have the check in your hand.'' 
 All real estate is local, as brokers like to say, and comparable sales information is most useful within a smaller neighborhood, because prices vary so much even within one community. 
 Nevertheless, all the reporting agencies are concluding that the number of sales of single-family homes in 2008 was down from 2007 in the New York metropolitan area, and prices in general were down. The median price for a home sold in the metropolitan area was $458,600 in the fourth quarter of 2008, down 11.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Those figures reflect the agency's tracking of sales in Bergen, Hudson and Passaic Counties in New Jersey; and the Bronx, Kings, Putnam and Westchester Counties in New York. 
 On Long Island, the median sale price of homes in 2008 was $378,688 in Suffolk County, compared with $410,000 the year before, and $455,000 in Nassau County, down from $490,000 in 2007, according to the New York State Association of Realtors.
 The number of pending home sales in the Northeast, meanwhile, decreased 14.5 percent from December 2007 to December 2008, according to the National Association of Realtors. And some experts are warning that the housing market may not hit rock bottom for at least another year.
 A seller's anguish may not be as sharp as the pain of a homeowner facing foreclosure. But the situation can alter life plans and jettison hopes. 
 Some sellers are losing hope.
 Consider Mary Beth Lang of Shelton, Conn. She is 62, with grown children and a husband who retired as a buyer for a technology company. Her dream went like this: sell the house and move to their new custom home in Kentucky.
 Her five-bedroom, four-bath house went on the market for more than $1 million in 2006. The price has since slid to $875,000, but there are no takers. Repainted, with many personal effects removed to look less cluttered, it no longer feels like home. The Kentucky house? It's for sale, too. 
 ''Sometimes dreams just blow away,'' Ms. Lang said. ''Everything is incredibly depressing. Of course, there are people with sadder stories.''
 Conventional wisdom holds that well-priced, attractive and aggressively marketed homes will sell. Now that is not necessarily true, said Cynthia Lippolis, principal broker with River Towns GMAC Real Estate in Croton-on-Hudson. ''I have some good listings that are priced very well and attractive, yet they are sitting there,'' she said. ''The economy is holding everyone back.''
 James Bednar, a real estate agent representing buyers at DRI Real Estate Company in Ridgewood, N.J., said many sellers overvalue their homes.
 ''The industry has nailed into people's minds that their houses are worth a certain amount,'' said Mr. Bednar, who blogs about the New Jersey market at njrereport.com. ''Sellers remember what neighbors sold their houses for two years ago and hold on to those unrealistic comparables. They need to accept the current reality of the market.'' 
 Mr. Bednar said he knows that sellers do not always have the leeway to drop their price. Others will be asked to pay a steep price for features buyers consider undesirable.
 ''In a boom time, buyers tend to overlook things like a high tension line that's a little close to the house, a street that's a little too busy or an odd layout,'' Mr. Bednar said. ''In a down market like this, those preferences are magnified.'' 
 JONATHAN GREENBERG paid $792,000 for a lake house in Montville, N.J., in 2005, attracted by its unusual architecture and striking views. Then he invested nearly $100,000 in improvements. At the time he was single, but is now married and a father. With its steep slopes and 30-foot drop to the lake, the property is not ''kid-friendly,'' said Mr. Greenberg, who sells investment properties for a living. He listed the house a year ago for $930,000. The price is now $670,000. 
 ''People say they love it, but it doesn't have some of the fundamentals families are looking for,'' said Mr. Greenberg, 41, whose wife, Malu, is expecting a second child. ''It'd be perfect for New Yorkers who need some kind of getaway. It's stressful. We do feel stuck.''
 Some sellers manage to find equilibrium in limbo. 
 Pamela and Daniel Greenhall of Aberdeen Township, N.J., have been trying to sell their ranch-style home since May, when they learned they were expecting a third child. Their house, priced at $279,900, has three bedrooms and one bath. Mrs. Greenhall, 33, a school counselor, and her husband, 33, a carpenter, bought the house for $235,000 in 2004 and took out a loan for renovations. ''If it sold, we wouldn't stand to make a dime,'' she said.
 Last month Mrs. Greenhall prepared for the new baby by converting one child's bedroom into a nursery and doubling the children up in the other.
 ''We're blessed in that we can still afford it,'' said Mrs. Greenhall, who delivered a boy on Feb. 3. ''We're comfortable. Is it a little cramped? Yes. Am I being overtaken by toys? Yes. But that's O.K.''
 Margaret and Matt Brown, teachers in Westchester, took a similar approach. Last spring, when Mrs. Brown, 38, was pregnant with their second child, they listed their two-bedroom home in White Plains for $519,000. Within a month they reduced the price to $499,000.
 As the baby's birth approached, the couple took the house off the market. Just then a buyer offered $475,000, but the couple rejected the offer.
 ''Now it's $465,000,'' said Mrs. Brown, a little ruefully, referring to the current asking price. 
 The new baby arrived last June, and in January the house was put back on the market. On the Feb. 7-8 weekend the Browns staged an open house themselves, after listing their home on Craigslist, placing advertisements in two newspapers and sending e-mail messages to everyone they know.
 Twenty-three people showed up. Mrs. Brown said that 11 knew about the open house from a sign outside; 6 spied the listing on Craigslist; 4 were referred by friends; and one saw a newspaper advertisement. (One declined to talk.)
 In the meantime, the Browns made an offer on a bigger house conditioned on the sale of their house. The owners accepted it, but are leaving the country and anxious to sell.
 ''That puts a little pressure on us,'' Mrs. Brown said. After the open house she paid to list the house with an online multiple listing service. 
 People who move into a new place before selling their old one feel even more stressed. Take Patrick Sweeney, 43, a father of three from Rowayton, Conn., who put his home on the market after he and his wife agreed to divorce and moved into separate homes. Mr. Sweeney is a builder who constructed the six-bedroom, six-bath house himself. 
 The house went on the market last month for $1,995,000, $300,000 less than Mr. Sweeney had banked on. There were no offers. He was surprised.
 ''The thinking was always, 'It will sell in a heartbeat,' '' Mr. Sweeney said. 
 He is worried now, and he plans to drop the price this spring. ''This can't go on forever,'' he said. ''It's got to go. We're paying to keep the heat on.''
 In spite of the months without a buyer, Ms. Faello of Dix Hills is still optimistic that her house will sell, if she can just find the right approach. First she listed with a broker, then switched to an online multiple listing service that charged a flat fee. She also listed the property on Craigslist, which cost her nothing, and on ForSaleByOwner.com, which charged. Recently she began interviewing new real estate agents.
 ''I feel as if I get a little sharper each time,'' she said. ''The amazing thing is, they'll see your home and come up with a number they justify by saying they've sold homes for that in the area. But list with them, and they're ready to drop the price.''

HEADLINE: Trapped in Their Own Homes

BYLINE: By MARY JO PATTERSON

 BODY:
LIKE many other young suburban families, Pamela and Daniel Greenhall of Aberdeen Township have outgrown their first house. It's a classic ''starter home,'' with three bedrooms and one bath. 
 Last year, when the Greenhalls learned they were expecting a third child, they put the ranch-style house on the market for $279,000. That's when the waiting began. 
 Mrs. Greenhall, 33, a school counselor, kept the house neat, clean and organized at all times, no small task for a parent with two young children. If she knew potential buyers were coming by, she put flowers on the kitchen table, or lighted a candle. If a car slowed, she wondered if the driver were a buyer. She called her real estate agent constantly. 
 As the months rolled by and no buyer materialized, Mrs. Greenhall tried to put the sale of the house out of her mind. She stopped calling the agent, resolved not to look at bigger homes lest she fall in love with one and bought bunk beds. Last month she prepared for the new baby by converting one child's bedroom into a nursery and doubling up the children in the other. 
 The Greenhalls would still like to sell their house. But they are trying to make the best of things. 
 ''We're blessed in that we can still afford it,'' said Mrs. Greenhall, who delivered a boy on Feb. 3. ''We're comfortable. Is it a little cramped? Yes. Am I being overtaken by toys? Yes. But that's O.K.'' 
 Other would-be sellers in New York City's suburbs are finding the situation harder to bear, whether they are trying to sell a Cape Cod for $300,000 or a center hall Colonial for $1 million. In a housing market characterized by eroding home values, high inventory and tight credit for borrowers, many feel stuck in a place they don't want or can't afford. As the recession becomes more severe and unemployment mounts, they fret each week their properties remain unsold, and fear losing equity. While buyers hunt for exceptional values, sellers feel like hostages. And their pain is sometimes drawn out when deals that seem to be done blow up just before the closing.

 It seemed like a good price for the house, a six-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath ranch in Dix Hills in Suffolk County on Long Island. But it didn't sell at that price, or at $750,000, where it landed six months later, or at $699,000, where it stands now.

 In Westchester, Margaret and Matt Brown, both teachers, also had to accommodate a growing family. Last spring, when Mrs. Brown, 38, was pregnant with their second child, they listed their two-bedroom home in White Plains for $519,000. Within a month they reduced the price to $499,000.
 As the baby's birth approached, the couple took the house off the market. Just then a buyer offered $475,000, but the couple rejected the offer.

HEADLINE: A Market Going Downhill Fast

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

DATELINE: Montclair 

 BODY:
 IN the heady real estate days of the summer of 2005, a well-maintained house in a decent school district would not last long on the market. That was when a three-bedroom ranch house at 46 Windermere Road here achieved its peak-value moment. 
 The red-brick ranch sold that July for $709,000 -- fetching $50,000 over asking price -- after just 10 days on the market. 
 Fast forward to the spring of 2008, and a market gone slack, not just in Montclair or Essex County, but in all 21 counties of the nation's second-wealthiest state. The brick ranch was for sale again, and had been, on and off, for more than a year. The owner had given up on getting his price, and moved out. The bank had agreed to a ''short sale'' in which it would recover less than it was owed. The asking price was reduced to $599,000. 
 ''That seemed like a really good price when we first saw it,'' said John Strong, who finally bought the house with his partner, Heather Carter. ''But there were no lights in the house -- the electricity had been turned off -- and later we could see there were problems, because it had been empty and not kept up.'' The final price at the closing last month: $528,110.
 Over the course of three and a half years, the New Jersey residential market has headed downhill fast. In September 2006, Jeffrey G. Otteau, whose Otteau Valuation Group gathers data on the residential market for many builders and brokers, said there were 68,000 houses sitting on the market unsold for a month or longer, more than he had ever seen in his experience in this market. By spring 2007, there were 71,000 unsold houses, his firm reported, and by May 2008, that number had climbed again, to 74,000. 
 At the same time, the pace of sales kept lagging, sometimes erratically, but always headed down, according to monthly reports from Mr. Otteau's firm, based in New Brunswick. Each December, on a line graph depicting month-by-month sales during the year, the squiggly line ended in a deeper valley than it had the previous year.
 More than a year ago, Mr. Otteau announced that his calculations indicated there would be a long wait before prices returned to 2005 levels. Not until 2014, he said at the time -- and that prediction was made well before Wall Street quaked, the mortgage lending market foundered and unemployment statistics started to skyrocket.
 The problem for many sellers now is that they cannot wait five years to sell their homes at prices comparable to what they paid for them.
 Tom Wragg, a mortgage broker with Worldwide Financial Resources Inc., has his family's three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath town house condo in the Crystal Woods complex in West Orange up for sale right now.
 He purchased the condo for $438,000 five years ago, when his first child was about to take his first step. Last year, after he and his wife had their third child, Mr. Wragg put the town house on the market at an asking price of $525,000. After 125 days without a buyer, the listing was withdrawn -- and the house was relisted on Jan. 1 at $489,900.
 Over the weekend of Feb. 7 and 8, when the weather was relatively balmy and small swarms of home shoppers actually emerged for various open houses around northern New Jersey, not a single prospective buyer showed up to view the town house, Mr. Wragg said.
 ''It's a little disturbing,'' said his real estate agent, Perri K. Feldman of Keller Williams in Summit, ''because this home is now very well priced.''
 Ms. Feldman said last week that she was talking with two other sellers whose homes' values had apparently slid below what the sellers originally paid. She said she was considering when to tell them that their only option appeared to be selling short and moving on with no nest egg profit in hand.
 As of January, the state had a 17-month supply of houses on the market, according to Otteau Group figures. That means that even if no other houses were put up for sale, it would still take 17 months to sell those already available, under current market conditions.
 In Bergen County, it would take an estimated 15 years and 4 months to sell all the houses now on the market priced at $2.5 million or more. In Morris County, for homes priced from $1 million to $2.5 million, it would take seven and a half years, and in Warren County, for homes priced from $600,000 to $1 million, five years and one month.
 With unsold-house inventories like those, and the probability that the economic malaise will continue for some time, Mr. Otteau's most recent prediction is that New Jersey home prices will continue to drop.
 Prices have declined by an average of 15 to 20 percent in every county in the past three and a half years, contract sales data indicates. At the start of 2009, some real estate professionals said they had noticed a few sellers starting to ''see the light'' and agreeing to slash asking prices by 10 to 20 percent, sometimes even 25 percent.
 James Bednar, who writes the real-estate blog njrereport.com, said last month that it was high time for both buyers and sellers to face reality. He proposed a new mantra for them: ''Home prices can fall. Home prices can fall. Home prices can fall further than I believe possible. Home prices are falling and will continue to fall.''

HEADLINE: Fears of Blight In a Land of Plenty

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BINDLEY

 BODY:
TALK of empty storefronts, vacant lots and unfinished residential developments is commonplace in New York these days. But in the affluent Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale, such chatter strikes many residents as a new and troubling development. 
 ''It looks horrible,'' said Kathy Goldstein, a 40-year-old mother of two, who one recent Monday afternoon was surveying the scene from the window of Palombo bakery on Riverdale Avenue. Gesturing north, she pointed toward the most glaring evidence of the community's commercial woes, a two-block stretch between 236th and 238th Streets that is home to eight empty storefronts.
 Store closings along Riverdale Avenue have become so prevalent that The Daily News declared this strip a ''ghost town,'' adding, ''You almost might expect a tumbleweed to roll by.'' The Riverdale Press, a local newspaper, cited this stretch in reporting on an ''epidemic of shuttered shops.''
 In December, community leaders organized a Greater Riverdale Chamber of Commerce. And last month, local residents from an online chat group for Riverdale families banded together to advocate for new stores.
 Gotham Auto School once occupied one of four empty storefronts on this strip held by the same landlord. Edward Goldstein, 75, who runs the school with his wife, said that last summer he relocated more than a mile away, to Mosholu Avenue, because his landlord would offer only a month-to-month lease. ''We couldn't accept that,'' said Mr. Goldstein (no relation to Kathy Goldstein). ''So we had to leave.'' 
 Jayson Blau, a lawyer who represents the principal owner of the four properties, would not disclose the names of the owners, and said plans for the storefronts have yet to be determined.
 ''All real estate is down,'' Mr. Blau said. ''They're holding onto everything and waiting to see what happens.''
 The other four storefronts are vacant for a variety of reasons, not all of them economic, but the total effect is one of a blighted commercial strip.
 Among the few newcomers on the stretch is a Sotheby's International Realty office, which opened last month. Vasco Da Silva, a vice president of the local office, said that Riverdale remained a prosperous area, though he acknowledged that the sight of empty storefronts can be alarming. ''It raises a question: Is this a ghost town?'' he said.
 Charles Moerdler, chairman of Community Board 8's land-use committee, said that the many unfinished residential and commercial developments coupled with the vacant storefronts created an ugly image that the community has to confront.
 But as for talk of ghost towns and tumbleweed, Mr. Moerdler said: ''This is not a situation where you have crossed the line by any stretch of the imagination. It's a situation where you're preventing the line from even coming on the horizon.''

HEADLINE: Gimme Back Your Paycheck

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
SHOULD executives get to keep lavish pay packages when the profits that generated their compensation go up in smoke? 
 As the financial crisis deepens, what might have been a philosophical question is now the topic of the day. With losses mounting at the nation's largest financial institutions, years of earnings have been erased, investors have lost billions, thousands of employees have been let go, and taxpayers have been tapped to rescue the financial system. But executives who helped set the problems in motion, or ignored them as they mounted, are still doing fine. Humbled, perhaps, but well paid for their anguish. 
 Executives at seven major financial institutions that have collapsed, were sold at distressed prices or are in deep to the taxpayer received $464 million in performance pay since 2005, according to an analysis performed for The New York Times. Almost half of that consisted of cash compensation.
 Yet these firms have reported losses of $107 billion since 2007, a result of their own missteps and the ensuing economic downturn. And $740 billion in stock market value has been lost since these companies' shares peaked in 2007, just before the housing bubble burst. 
 Against that landscape, a growing chorus is demanding that executive compensation snared shortly before problems emerged be given back.
 ''There is a line that separates fair compensation from stealing from shareholders,'' said Frederick E. Rowe, a money manager in Dallas and a founder of Investors for Director Accountability, a nonprofit group. ''When managements ignore that line or can't see it, then hell, yes, they should be required to give the money back.''
 Corporate boards that awarded lush executive pay packages almost always justified them by saying they encouraged superior performance and were directly tied to benchmarks like profitability. 
 But now, with a public backlash against excessive pay and taxpayer lifelines extended to crippled companies, the idea of recouping compensation, known as ''clawback,'' is gaining traction.
 Currently there is no legal mechanism for forcing the regurgitation of past pay, so such efforts would need to be bolstered by new legislation. Clawbacks also promise to be a hot-button issue at shareholder meetings in coming months.
 Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who heads the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has called for recovery of executive pay at companies that collapse. He posed this question to financial executives testifying before Congress last March: ''When companies fail to perform, should they give millions of dollars to their senior executives?'' 
 The seven troubled companies whose executives received almost $500 million in performance pay since 2005 are the American International Group, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Countrywide Financial, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Washington Mutual. Equilar, a compensation research firm, conducted the analysis of executive pay and earnings at these and other companies for The Times. 
 Analysts say that 2005 is a useful milestone because dubious lending started sweeping across the nation that year, and toxic assets began piling up at banks and other firms. 
 MANY of the chief executives who oversaw troubled financial institutions have exited the scene. And several of the companies that Equilar studied are no longer independent. Merrill, Countrywide, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual have been absorbed by competitors, while Lehman collapsed.
 Trying to get out in front of the compensation backlash, some executives are refusing bonuses and limiting their salaries. Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's C.E.O., recently said he would take a salary of $1 and would receive no bonuses until his troubled bank turned a profit. He has not received any performance pay since he took over the top job at Citigroup late in 2007.
 The seven companies highlighted in the Equilar study are not the only financial firms that turned in woeful results recently. Even companies that have managed to generate profits -- Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are three examples -- have received taxpayer aid. Executives at these companies, too, face shareholders angered by battered stock prices.
 Because the Equilar study uses only profitability as a basis for comparison among firms, it offers a relatively conservative look at how much pay might have been unfairly awarded.
 For example, the analysis of the seven companies -- among the most damaged on Wall Street -- doesn't take into account the pay of executives who left the scene after overseeing corporate practices that eventually caused their companies to careen off the rails. 
 Sanford I. Weill, for example, Citigroup's chief architect, received $205 million in performance pay in the four years before he handed over the reins to Charles O. Prince in 2003.
 Analysts contend that Mr. Weill's failure to effectively manage and knit together the financial behemoth he created in 1998 led directly to Citigroup's woes today. A spokesman for Mr. Weill said that Citigroup was profitable and financially healthy when he ran it. He noted that Mr. Weill has dropped a consulting arrangement with the bank, as well as use of its corporate aircraft, because of Citigroup's woes.
 Matching compensation to actual, long-term profitability at other firms is revealing.
 Consider Merrill, which Bank of America bought in a distress sale arranged last fall. Losses reported by Merrill as a result of the credit crisis totaled $35.8 billion in 2007 and 2008, enough to wipe out 11 years of earnings previously reported by the company. The losses dwarf those reported by any of the other companies that Equilar analyzed. 
 For the 11-year period from 1997 to 2008, Merrill's board gave its chief executives more than $240 million in performance-based compensation. The company had three chief executives during these years: David H. Komansky, who left in 2002, was followed by E. Stanley O'Neal. Mr. O'Neal was ousted in 2008 and replaced by John A. Thain, who was dismissed last month. 
 Mr. O'Neal's total pay for the six years he ran Merrill totaled $157.7 million. He declined to comment.
 To be sure, executive compensation at the companies in the Equilar study was almost always a blend of stock and cash, and the downturn has hammered the wealth of executives who kept their shares. But analysts say that even if stock awards were removed from the mix, executives still received windfalls.
 ''This is really in our view a giant fraudulent conveyance, where money was paid out to executives at firms that were fatally undercapitalized,'' said Daniel Pedrotty, director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. office of investment. ''We are arguing for a recovery of money that was used by people who treated these companies as a giant A.T.M. machine.''
 John D. Finnegan, the chief executive of the Chubb Corporation, has been the head of Merrill's compensation committee since 2007. Last March, when renewed outrage over pay packages for bankers emerged, he appeared before Congress. Lawmakers had questions about the $161 million that Merrill gave to Mr. O'Neal when he left the firm. 
 The essence of Mr. Finnegan's testimony was that Mr. O'Neal earned the money. ''Over 80 percent of the amount consists of company stock he received as part of his annual bonuses for 2006 and prior years,'' Mr. Finnegan said. ''Those bonuses were paid because of the company's and Mr. O'Neal's strong performance during those earlier periods.''
 Now that performance has turned to dust. Mr. Finnegan declined to comment.
 Many investors say the whole pay-for-performance model is a mirage because consultants are too willing to make clients happy by making sure they are handsomely compensated -- often regardless of performance. 
 John England, head of the financial services compensation practice at Towers Perrin, was the consultant on Merrill's pay practices. He or his firm also devised pay packages for Angelo R. Mozilo, the former chief of Countrywide, and for Kerry K. Killinger, the former chief at Washington Mutual. 
 Mr. England declined to be interviewed. A spokesman for Towers Perrin said that it did not comment on specific clients but that the firm was confident about its practices and that its expertise had ''resulted in the delivery of valuable, sound and objective executive compensation advice.'' 
 Yet Mr. England's white-collar clients also oversaw one of the greatest demolitions of financial value in history. 
 Countrywide generated losses of $3.9 billion in 2007 and early 2008, before it was absorbed by Bank of America last July. Those losses erased the company's entire earnings in 2006 and half of its profit for the previous year. But Mr. Mozilo received $82.4 million in performance pay between 2005 and 2008, roughly half in cash, according to Equilar. 
 Mr. Mozilo could not be reached for comment.
 Washington Mutual, overseen by Mr. Killinger until federal authorities forced its sale last year to JPMorgan Chase, is another case. Its mortgage-related losses of $8 billion in 2007 and 2008 wipe out all of its earnings in 2006 and 2005 and three months' worth of profits generated in 2004. 
 Mr. Killinger received $38.2 million in performance pay between 2005 and 2008, Equilar said; of that amount, just $7.6 million was paid in cash, the rest in stock. A spokesman for Mr. Killinger said he would not comment. 
 Bear Stearns, which collapsed last March under the weight of soured mortgage holdings before it could record major losses, awarded its chief, James E. Cayne, $58.5 million in performance pay from 2005 through 2007. Some $30 million of that was cash, and the rest was stock. Mr. Cayne could not be reached for comment.
 EVEN as shareholder ire over burgeoning pay packages has risen, recoveries of compensation are rare. 
 ''I think you can count on two hands the number of voluntary or involuntary returns of compensation by executives,'' said Paul Hodgson, senior research associate at the Corporate Library, a corporate governance research firm. ''More companies are introducing clawback provisions, but instituting the provisions and actually clawing back the pay are two different things.'' 
 In the past, clawbacks were typically considered only in cases of fraud or accounting irregularities. Now shareholders want clawbacks if compensation ultimately encouraged dangerously risky behavior and was based on profits that later evaporated. 
 The initiative is directed almost exclusively at companies' most senior management, not at lower-level employees who earned relatively modest sums.
 Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general for one of the federal bailout efforts, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, is examining compensation given to top managers at banks that received money under the program. And as the annual shareholder meeting season approaches, executive pay is expected to be an even more contentious issue, analysts say. 
 ''Poorly structured pay packages encouraged the get-rich-quick mentality and overly risky behavior that helped bring financial markets to their knees and wiped out profits at so many companies,'' said Amy Borrus, deputy director at the Council of Institutional Investors. ''And yet many of these C.E.O.'s have pocketed enormous compensation.'' Brian Foley, an independent compensation consultant in White Plains, said clawbacks shouldn't be the only goal of irate shareholders. He said boards should also recover performance-based contributions to executives' pensions, because those payments were also tied to profits that may have proved fleeting.
 ''If these guys accumulated money during years when the earnings actually was not earned,'' he asked, ''why shouldn't the pensions be clawed back as well?''

HEADLINE: Enforcement Gone Bad

 BODY:
The failures of the immigration system are many and severe, but the main problem is not that the country is catching too few undocumented immigrants. It is catching too many. Since the early 1990s, you could write the federal government's immigration strategy on a cardboard sign: Deport Them All. 
 A report last week from the Pew Hispanic Center laid bare some striking results of that campaign. It found that Latinos now make up 40 percent of those sentenced in federal courts, even though they are only about 13 percent of the adult population. They accounted for one-third of federal prison inmates in 2007. 
 The numbers might suggest we are besieged by immigrant criminals. But of all the noncitizen Latinos sentenced last year, the vast majority -- 81 percent -- were convicted for unlawfully entering or remaining in the country, neither of which is a criminal offense. 
 The country is filling the federal courts and prisons with nonviolent offenders. It is diverting immense law-enforcement resources from pursuing serious criminals -- violent thugs, financial scammers -- to an immense, self-defeating campaign to hunt down ... workers.
 The Pew report follows news this month that even as a federal program to hunt immigrant fugitives saw its budget soar -- to $218 million last year from $9 million in 2003 -- its mission went astray. According to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, of the 72,000 people arrested through last February, 73 percent had no criminal record. Border Patrol agents in California and Maryland, meanwhile, tell of pressure to arrest workers at day-labor corners and convenience stores to meet quotas. 
 The country needs to control its borders. It needs to rebuild an effective immigration system and thwart employers who cheat it. It needs to bring the undocumented forward and make citizen taxpayers of them.
 For all the billions spent on fences, raids, patrols and prisons, the number of illegal immigrants has steadily grown to about 12 million last year from four million in 1992. So has the need to overhaul the many parts of a festering, broken system: to clear out backlogs in legal immigration, to rescue families from limbo, to throw sunlight on the shadow economy, to deter unlawful hiring, to replace chaos with lawfulness and order. All those priorities have languished in the deportation era.

 CORRECTION:
An editorial on Feb. 22 stated incorrectly that unlawfully entering the country is not a criminal offense. It is a misdemeanor for a first-time offender.

HEADLINE: As Livelihoods End, Bowed but Proud

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE. 
e-mail: jersey@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Florence 

 BODY:
 ON his last day of work at the sprawling riverfront foundry here, Tom Darmo looked up from the stacks of pipes he was counting and decided that, after 22 years, the time had come for him to visit the one spot where he had never set foot before: the peak of the cupola, the five-story furnace where scrap metal was melted and transformed into something new.
 The cupola is the highest point at Griffin Pipe, and on this last morning before the plant's closing it was probably the coldest, too. Winds were gusting near 50 miles an hour, whipping up whitecaps on the gray Delaware. Mr. Darmo, 42, tightened the band inside his hard hat and, with three colleagues from the quality control department, started climbing the narrow ladders toward the uppermost catwalk. 
 ''It was like us going to Mount Everest,'' he said later, after he and roughly 200 other workers had left their old jobs for the last time. ''I've looked at it from afar for many years, but I've never been up to the top. I will never forget that. It was a special time for us.''
 He could see everything from up on the cupola, more than 200 acres of a foundry whose roots were more than 200 years deep, a place most people around here presumed was too old and too big to ever close. ''The First Company to Manufacture Cast Iron Pipe in the United States,'' the sign out front declares; before it was bought by Griffin Pipe in 1962, it was the R. D. Wood Company, which was founded in Millville in 1803 and took over an existing foundry here in 1867. If you live anywhere in the northeastern United States, you have almost certainly used water that has flowed through a pipe that was made here.
 But those 200 years ended quietly on Lincoln's Birthday, while Congress was still debating an economic stimulus package that was arriving too late to save these jobs in this old river town just south of Trenton, where too many families already know what happens when a factory locks its gates.
 ''We were expecting a temporary layoff, maybe three months,'' said Mark Babula, 38, unit chairman of Local 2040B of the United Steelworkers, the union that represents 175 hourly employees at Griffin. But the economy was worse than anyone had ever imagined: Housing starts had plummeted, and so had the demand for water pipes. Just a year earlier, just three miles downriver in Burlington, another old foundry, U.S. Pipe, had closed. 
 The news arrived several weeks before Christmas: a complete shutdown of production. It was the same kind of hammer blow that hit Mr. Babula's father and grandfather in 1974, when the Roebling steel mill -- the center of the meticulously planned industrial village just three miles north of Griffin, and the maker of the suspension cables that hold up most of the landmark American bridges of the 20th century -- shut down, and tossed them out of work. 
 The final day at Griffin was marked by no ceremony. ''Everybody just kind of drifted away,'' said Mr. Babula, whose father grew up in a house built by Roebling for its workers and who lives with his wife and their 2-year-old son in an R. D. Wood house, a seven-minute walk from the plant where he worked for 15 years. ''But everybody went out proud.'' 
 Production had stopped almost a week earlier, so when paychecks were distributed at midmorning, most workers saw little point in sticking around till the end of the shift. One by one, they trickled out through the gate, carrying bags filled with dirty clothes from their lockers, some with several pairs of boots dangling like strings of bass. 
 By midafternoon a couple dozen of them had convened at a place called Wesley's up in Roebling, across the street from the mostly vacant parcel where the old mill had once stood. They traded stories about their lost world at the same long mahogany bar where the Roebling workers had once traded stories about their own.
 There was some grumbling: about who got the few jobs that will remain as the plant becomes a distribution center for pipes made at Griffin's other locations, in Virginia and Iowa; about the recent ascendancy of managers unschooled in the ways of the old foundrymen; about what seemed a myopic strategy of shutting down, rather than riding through the rough times with a layoff; about the gyrations that R. D. Wood must be making in his grave.
 But mostly there was sadness, and worry about the prospect of finding new jobs in an economy so bad that it killed a plant that had survived so many other downturns. ''I went from making $48,000 a year to unemployment,'' said John Sheehan, who worked at the foundry for 22 years, and whose wife's father and grandfather had worked there before him. When his health coverage ends in four and half months, his insurance will become unaffordable: $1,000 a month, he said, half his unemployment check. ''I have to start all over at 42 years old.''
 Hourly wages at Griffin ranged from $18 to $23, but in good years, when demand was high and overtime was plentiful, some workers made more than $60,000. ''Everyone needs water and sewer lines,'' Mr. Sheehan said. ''I never thought this would happen.''
 More workers arrived at Wesley's as the afternoon deepened, and they helped themselves to the spread of free food the owners had put out for them: pulled pork, Cajun wings, vodka rigatoni. A few had leads for new jobs, but more did not, and the chances of finding ones like the kind they had just left seemed to be growing dimmer each day.
 ''When you lose your manufacturing base, you're losing your backbone, you're losing your strength,'' Tom Darmo said. ''Now we're enslaved to China and these underdeveloped countries where they treat the workers terribly and they don't have pollution controls.'' 
 Mr. Darmo had a new listener, and he was telling the story again of his ascent to the summit of the cupola, a perch from which he had seen not just the foundry that he was about to leave, but also all the way north to the memory of another plant from which an earlier generation of workers had once been expelled: the remnants of the Roebling mill just across the street. 
 ''It was so windy it was scary,'' he said. He held on tight, though, braced against the wind that threatened to blow him away, but never quite managed to.

HEADLINE: Bagging Bargains in South Africa

BYLINE: By JOSHUA HAMMER. 
JOSHUA HAMMER is a former Newsweek bureau chief and correspondent at large in Africa and the Middle East. His next book, the story of a colonial-era uprising in German southwest Africa, will be published in 2010.

 BODY:
The inhabited world seems to peter out at Noordhoek Beach, a five-mile strip of white sand bordered by verdant cliffs, on the Atlantic coast of the Cape Peninsula 15 miles southwest of Cape Town. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, with a pale sun shining weakly through an overcast sky, a friend and I followed a trail on horseback through dunes and wetlands leading to the coast. A long-billed Hadeda ibis and a pair of Egyptian geese waded in a freshwater stream swollen with recent rains. 
 The horses broke into a trot, then a canter, as we hit the beach speckled with gnarled driftwood and great, squiggly strands of kelp. In the distance, a near-perpendicular cliff face soared high above the sea, its striated green flank cut by the fabled Chapman's Peak Drive, one of the world's most heart-stopping stretches of asphalt. The air was thick with seagulls, cormorants and black oystercatchers. We watched a huge seagull soar high in the air, a clam in its beak, and drop its prize on the sand; two dozen attempts later, it succeeded in breaking open the shell, and ripped into the clam's flesh. 
 Farther on, I caught sight of a dark form moving in the sand; it was an injured seal in its death throes. ''They wash up all the time,'' our guide, Hope Flex, told us. ''Nothing can be done for them.'' The creature wagged its flippers, lay still, then lifted its head and flopped down again. I turned my horse away and continued down the beach. 
 There's wildness to Cape Town -- the big skies, the rugged canyons, the jagged outcroppings of sandstone and granite that rise over the icy South Atlantic at the tip of Africa. Penguins waddle across white-sand beaches, elands roam the dunes, hungry baboons swoop down from their shrinking forest habitat on unsuspecting suburbanites, ripping apart their cupboards and closets in a desperate search for sustenance.
 Part Alaska, part Big Sur, but always African, Cape Town can overwhelm a visitor with its grand-scale landscapes and its feeling of remoteness. It's an agoraphobic's nightmare, this patch of wind-whipped scrubland and mountain at the bottom of the world, and a naturalist's dream.
 But there's another side of Cape Town as well: the Dutch colonists who settled in the Constantia Valley 350 years ago were determined to tame nature, and they covered the fertile, sun-drenched basin with vineyards that still produce some of the world's finest wines.
 Beach communities like Kalk Bay, reminiscent of Massachusetts -- a funky mix of tidy Edgartown and rough-edged New Bedford -- hug the coast. Then there's the urban poverty that most tourists, and most white Capetonians, seldom see, except when they pass by it on the way to and from Cape Town International Airport: the squatter camps of the Cape Flats, where tens of thousands of immigrants from impoverished rural areas dwell in shacks beside canals overflowing with raw sewage, and makeshift bars, or shabeens, fill with the alcoholic and the unemployed. 
 The city's collisions of culture, class and geography can be both exhilarating and unsettling, as I discovered while I lived in Cape Town as a Newsweek correspondent between 2005 and 2007. What's more, it's all become very cheap to experience. The ouster of President Thabo Mbeki last September, along with continuing trouble in neighboring Zimbabwe and the worldwide economic crisis have pushed the South African rand to its lowest level in five years. The rate of exchange was 7 rand to the dollar when I left in March 2007; these days it's around 10. 
 Even though high South African inflation has pushed up prices in rand, they have declined in dollars. A night in a double superior room in the summer high season at the Constantia, a boutique hotel in the Constantia Valley, for example, has risen in the past year from 3,100 rand to 3,400 rand, but in dollars it has declined from about $400 to $345. 
 It's now possible to stay in a cheaper but still very good hotel room, rent a car, eat a couple of excellent meals and hike or mountain bike in the world's most magnificent wilderness reserves, all for a total of $300 a day. For the budget-conscious outdoor-loving American traveler looking for a bargain in the recessionary era, Cape Town is hard to beat.
 I arrived in Cape Town in mid-November, at the start of the Southern Hemisphere's summer, and decided to splurge for the first two nights of my stay at the Constantia, on Cape Town's historic wine route. Elegantly furnished suites laid out around lawns and bamboo gardens, breakfast on a patio facing the rugged Steenberg Mountains, a private mini-swimming pool in the tiled courtyard outside every room -- it was easy to feel guilty about such shameless self indulgence, but I was paying only the equivalent of $250 a night at a temporary discounted rate, so I didn't dwell on it. The Constantia was a luxurious and well-situated base from which to rediscover the city. 
 Early on my first afternoon in Cape Town, I set out for the Foodbarn in Noordhoek, a prominent example, I had been told, of the culinary revolution that Cape Town has undergone in recent years. I drove from the Constantia over Ou Kaapse Weg -- Old Cape Road in Afrikaans -- a two-lane ribbon that winds steeply through the Steenbergs. Like much of the Cape Peninsula, this treeless range of hills is blanketed with fynbos -- the hard-leafed heathlike vegetation that evolved in isolation in this windswept, arid and fire-prone corner of the world. 
 After climbing through the rolling terrain to about 2,000 feet above False Bay, the road dipped toward Noordhoek, a rural beachside community that feels Californian -- a bit like Topanga Canyon, a bit like Malibu.
 The Foodbarn, which occupies a thatched-roof A-frame that was originally a farm store, was created two and a half years ago by Franck Dangereux, the Cannes-born former head chef of Constantia's La Colombe, which was named the best restaurant in South Africa several times by the Business Day newspaper. Mr. Dangereux has turned the Foodbarn into the most talked-about bistro in the city, mixing Provencal, Moroccan, Middle Eastern and pan-Asian elements, but following the worldwide food trend of going local: he almost never shops for ingredients more than 30 miles beyond his Noordhoek home.
 ''I want to boost the Cape Town growers,'' the bald, animated Mr. Dangereux told me when he joined me and my dining companion, Peter Bouckaert, a South Africa-based Human Rights Watch investigator, at our table in the sun-splashed cafe. (Mr. Dangereux breaks the rules during the summer oyster season, when he imports what he describes as ''fat, greasy'' mollusks from neighboring Namibia.) The Foodbarn's prix-fixe menu that afternoon consisted of a crispy prawn and avocado salad garnished with minted baba ghanouj salsa, followed by grilled salmon on a bed of crushed Nicola potato, with cream of garlic and cinnamon oil, and an iced cafe au lait for dessert. Peter and I washed the meal down with a local sauvignon blanc. The total cost of a superb lunch for two: less than $50. 
 After two nights of self-indulgence at the Constantia, I moved a couple of miles north to the Bishops' Court, a bed-and-breakfast on a quiet road in the exclusive southern suburb of Bishopscourt. Here, both the climate and the landscape change dramatically from the dry, Mediterranean-like Constantia Valley and the adjacent Steenberg Mountains.
 The heavily forested eastern facade of Table Mountain attracts more rainfall than any other part of the Cape Peninsula, and the suburbs along the monolith's lower flanks -- Bishopscourt, Newlands, Claremont -- are deep green and bursting with bougainvillea, frangipani, eucalyptus, date palms and other semitropical and tropical vegetation. The French doors of my room looked toward Kirstenbosch, the national botanical gardens, and, just beyond, the iconic massif of Table Mountain itself -- its striated folds of sandstone turning purple, then gold, as they caught the first rays of the sun. 
 KIRSTENBOSCH, established in 1913 for the protection and study of southern Africa's indigenous flora, exemplifies Cape Town's juxtapositions of wildness and cultivation. Its Table Mountain backdrop, with a tangle of forest clinging to the rough sandstone face, exudes the raw power of nature, while its meticulously landscaped grounds reflect the hand of man. 
 I paid the entry fee -- about $3 -- and followed gravel and cobblestone paths, lined with occasional benches for contemplation, that wound past manicured lawns; ponds; gardens of protea, ericas, restios and other hard-leafed shrubs and plants unique to the Cape Peninsula; and lush groves of trees from across southern Africa, including yellow woods, common cabbages, wild almonds, wild cottons, and quinines. In the tranquillity of an early Sunday morning, the only sounds I heard were the calls of whippoorwills and the trickle of a natural spring. (The layers of porous sandstone that form the bedrock of the Cape Peninsula are perfect vessels for trapping groundwater.)
 The paths through Kirstenbosch merge with hiking trails that climb steeply to the top of Table Mountain. But I had done the challenging daylong hike three years earlier while living in Cape Town, and I decided to pass. Instead, I devoted my energy to dining out. Lunch was at an old favorite: the River Cafe at Constantia Uitsig, a centuries-old vineyard in the heart of the valley. For dinner, I followed Frank Dangereux's recommendation and headed to Bizerca, opened last year by Laurent and Cyrillia Deslandes, a Loire Valley-born chef, and his South African wife. It is one of many new high-end restaurants that are animating once-desolate corners of the city.
 A friend and I arrived on Jetty Street near the waterfront after dark, driving past a sea of high-rise office complexes to a brightly lighted bistro that shone like a beacon amid sterile surroundings. A Johannesburg designer had remodeled the space, a former Bible-study center, as a kind of funky factory, with chocolate-and-vanilla-swirl concrete floors, steel-frame windows and a tangle of exposed aluminum ducts and pipes. The place was packed: the energy was palpable. We started the meal by sharing a delicate beet-root, goat cheese and beet-root sorbet salad followed by king prawns and pork bellies on a bed of sweet potato puree and chili jam. My main course was free-range chicken and spiced garbanzo beans, and dessert was a raspberry sorbet. With a bottle of local chenin blanc, the price of a dinner for two was $62.
 I spent the next several days rediscovering familiar pleasures -- a climb up Lion's Head peak before sunset, the chili prawns at Toni's, a Mozambican restaurant on Kloof Street in the city center -- and discovering new ones. I hiked along deserted trails through meadows and pine forests at Silvermine, a part of Table Mountain National Park, watching as a dense mist rolled in from False Bay then making my way back to the parking lot on a cliffside path in a warm drizzle. I drank Castle beers and watched South African cricket with a friend at his local pub, the Foresters Arms in Newlands, a way station for travelers and their horses during the early days of the British-run Cape Colony. 
 On my last full day in Cape Town, I met Peter Bouckaert at his home in Simon's Town, the southernmost town on the Cape Peninsula and home to a colony of African penguins (formerly known as jackass penguins because of their braying, mule-like call), for a day of lobsterdiving at the bottom of the world. I rented a wet suit, gloves and boots from a local dive shop for the equivalent of about $15, to insulate myself against the 60-degree South Atlantic. I paid another $7 or so for a fishing permit, which would allow me to take home four lobsters. Then we set out for the Cape of Good Hope.
 Half an hour later we parked our Land Rover on the shoulder of a road overlooking the ocean. With gear-laden duffel bags balanced on our shoulders, Peter and I splashed through tidal pools, climbed over dunes, and dodged boulders strewn across sandy trails. A pale green blanket of beach grass and spiny shrubbery, speckled by purple irises, sloped gently upward to our right. To our left, the surf crashed against a curving, rocky beach. 
 It could have been Maine or Newfoundland were it not for the occasional reminder that this was Africa. A pair of blesboks, or antelopes, plodded across the dunes, gazing at us with doleful eyes. Three ostriches nibbled at tufts of beach grass. 
 Two miles up the deserted beach, Peter gestured toward clumps of olive-colored kelp bobbing just off shore. ''This is the spot,'' he said. I dumped my bag on a pile of rocks, squeezed into my hooded wet suit and slid off a barnacle-covered boulder, wincing as the frigid water seeped between my body and the neoprene. I dived beneath the surface, and combed through the tangle of seaweed where the crustaceans usually lurk. Though my body warmed up quickly, the water numbed my hands and seeped into my boots; more water gushed into my ill-fitting mask. I cleared my snorkel and dived again, peering into the murky depths. 
 Minutes later I surfaced and saw Peter swimming toward the rocks; he climbed out of the water and ripped off his mask in frustration. ''I can't see a thing,'' he said. Nor could I. Swirling sediments stirred up by recent storms, had left us groping like blind men for our evening's anticipated supper. We clung to the rocks, battered by the waves, and watched a pair of surfers ride a breaker a hundred yards off shore.
 The African sun dipped low, glinting off the Atlantic with blinding intensity. I lay back on the beach and basked in the warmth of the fading day as a pair of cormorants dived and weaved. Then we hoisted our duffel bags, and empty-handed but content, we began the long hike back to our car. 
 GOOD HOPE, GOOD MEALS

HEADLINE: El Anatsui

BYLINE: By ALEXI WORTH

 BODY:
One day 10 years ago in the countryside of southern Nigeria, a slim middle-aged man drove past a bag of garbage. Garbage is not an unusual sight in West Africa; village roads are often lined with a parallel hillock of trash -- dusty bottles, spoiled food, tin cans, car parts -- out of which small trees sometimes grow. But this solitary bag looked promising. It was a quiet, sunny late afternoon in the dry season. The man stopped the car and walked over to look inside. 
 A decade later, the contents of that bag have toured the world from Wales to Arizona and come to rest, transformed but recognizable, in some of the world's most famous museums. Next year they will arrive in New York to be celebrated as part of the opening of the dramatically transformed Museum for African Art, in its new home on upper Fifth Avenue. They will be a centerpiece of the museum's reopening exhibition -- and, more than that, a proof of the growing prominence of contemporary African art on the world stage. It's possible that they may join the short list, along with Duchamp's bicycle wheel, Rauschenberg's bed and Koons's basketballs, of masterpiece detritus: once mundane objects that permanently transform our expectations about what art is, and where it comes from. 
 The one thing least transformed by that accidental discovery is the man himself, a West African artist who goes by the name of El Anatsui. At the Nigerian university where he has taught for three decades, Anatsui is known simply as ''Prof'' -- a quiet, white-haired, bachelor member of the Senior Faculty Club, where he can be found most evenings playing checkers. As a puzzled but admiring Nigerian art dealer put it, ''He's almost a kind of messiah for us. . . . But in person, there's nothing, absolutely nothing, remarkable about him.'' 
 Nor was there anything especially remarkable inside the bag Anatsui found. Discarded by a local distillery, it held thousands of aluminum screw-tops from bottles of whiskey, rum and gin, bearing names like Flying Horse, Castello, Bakassi, Liquor Headmaster, Ecomog and Dark Sailor. For a few months, the bag sat untouched in Anatsui's studio, while the artist continued to work on the abstract wood sculptures that had made him, in his mid-50s, among the most widely recognized African artists. At his own unhurried pace, Anatsui began experimenting with the bottle tops -- cutting and folding their pliable metal into flat swatches, and then stitching these together with copper wire. The result, as it grew, began to resemble fabric, a coarse, jangly metal cloth. 
 On first seeing one of these cloths a few years later in London, Kwame Anthony Appiah experienced ''one of the great artistic epiphanies of my life.'' Appiah, a Princeton University philosopher and art collector, remembers ''a vast cascading piece of cloth, glistening in red and gold, draped more than 20 feet high, and just as wide. I confess I was completely delighted.'' Appiah was also puzzled; like many viewers, he assumed ''El Anatsui'' was an Arabic name, and hence that the artist was North African. But in fact, Anatsui is a fellow Ghanaian, and the intricate, narrow-banded compositions of Anatsui's first cloths were recognizable variations of kente cloth, the emblematic fabric of Ghana. The works' Africanness was specific and emphatic but also complicated. A rich tradition was honored in poor materials, and those materials -- the flattened bottle caps, with their legible brand names -- suggested other connections as well: to global consumerism and, more obliquely, to slavery's economics, of which liquor was a key part. An elegant emulsion of history and craft, Post-Minimal form and Pop recycling, Anatsui's work left Appiah feeling ''enraptured.''
 Two years later in Venice, where Anatsui's wall hangings appeared as part of the 2007 Biennale, Gary Tinterow, the Metropolitan Museum of Art's curator of Modern art, felt equally smitten. ''I was blown away,'' Tinterow remembers. Curators often profess admiration, but in this case Tinterow picked up his cellphone -- there, in the exhibition hall -- and put in a call to his assistant in New York. The Met set about purchasing an Anatsui that day -- following in the footsteps of the British Museum in London, the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Met's own African department, which had purchased a smaller cloth sculpture the year before. 
 For many visitors to Venice, the mosaic-like beauty of Anatsui's glittering sculptures made them an unquestioned highlight of, and in some ways an antidote to, much of the rest of the Biennale. As Susan Vogel, a professor of African art at Columbia University, remembers, Anatsui's work was ''the last thing you saw in the Arsenale. And it was so different from everything else. Not only in materials and scale, but in beauty. It was the only thing that wasn't pessimistic. . . . You trudge past images of ruination, and you arrive at uplift, at resolution.'' 
 Robert Storr, the director of the 2007 Biennale, had deliberately set out to give Anatsui ''pride of place.'' More important, he hoped to tip him out of the orbit of strictly African exhibitions. In retrospect, that process had already begun, thanks to ''Gawu,'' a traveling Anatsui exhibition that began its tour of eight international venues in 2003. There were also shows at London's October Gallery and at two modest places in New York: Skoto Gallery and David Krut Projects. But Venice, for most observers, was the break-out moment. A follow-up solo show last January, at New York's Jack Shainman Gallery, confirmed the depth -- not to mention the commercial implications -- of Anatsui's appeal. As Shainman recalls, ''Even the people doing the electrical were freaking out over the work.'' At the end of the year, a Sotheby's auction catalog featured a wraparound reproduction of an Anatsui, folded around a Gerhard Richter. It was impossible to miss the implication: Anatsui had joined the big leagues. 
 Of course, in a sense, Anatsui had been in the big leagues for decades: he had exhibited on five continents, been reviewed extensively and even participated in a previous Venice Biennale, in 1990. But his work then remained subtly marginalized, paid a kind of respectful attention that was not entirely different from lip service. Skoto Aghahowa, whose New York gallery showed Anatsui back in 1996, has watched his current ascent with pleasure, but speaks about the condescension of well-meaning Westerners with a sigh. ''They get so focused on, 'How do you pronounce his name? How many wives does he have? He's from Ghana? Oh, my husband and I went to Ghana; we really love Ghana!' '' Only a few African artists have moved out of this atmosphere of benighted sympathy, and of these, the best known -- Yinka Shonibare, for instance -- tend to have made their homes and careers in the West. Among major contemporary artists, Anatsui is exceptional not only in being African but in being an African who has remained in Africa. A Ghanaian among Nigerians, he is a different, quieter kind of exile. 
 ANATSUI WAS BORN IN 1944, in what was then still the British colony of the Gold Coast -- the youngest, he says, of his father's 32 children. His mother died when he was young, so he grew up in the mission house of his uncle, a Presbyterian minister. At art school, in a country that had just achieved its independence, the curriculum was almost entirely Western: only in his last year did he realize that he felt restless, and began looking for ''something that had more relationship to me, as someone growing up in an African country.'' After graduation, Anatsui got a job teaching art and began studying African ideographs. In Ghana, the most common of these appear on cloths worn at funerals and are called adinkra. For his first mature body of work, Anatsui bought wooden food trays from local markets and burned or carved versions of adinkra symbols onto them. The effect was a kind of abstract painting, but one in which every element -- not just the graphic patterns but the material as well -- was adamantly local. 
 One of the adinkra symbols, sankofa, is an image of a bird turning back toward its tail; its meaning is sometimes translated as ''return and retrieve,'' or ''go back and pick.'' To Anatsui and his peers, sankofa symbolized their effort to find useful traditions -- from their own region, from elsewhere in Africa and even from the West. The critic and artist Olu Oguibe would later paraphrase sankofa as ''sitting square on your own tree while picking whatever is good from others.'' In Nigeria, a charismatic older artist named Uche Okeke was promoting a similar kind of open-minded traditionalism, usually referred to as ''Natural Synthesis.'' In 1975, Anatsui was invited to come teach with Okeke at the rural campus of the University of Nigeria in Nsukka. 
 By this time, in the second decade of independence, the political situation in West Africa was becoming less stable. Anatsui's next body of work, a series of broken, partially mended clay pots, reflected this precariousness while also drawing on his continuing research into indigenous traditions. ''We de Patcham,'' a reconstituted ceramic globe, took its title from a fatalist pidgin aphorism, ''We dey patch am e dey leak,'' meaning ''It leaks even as we struggle to mend it.'' Most of Anatsui's broken pots, though, suggested an underlying optimism, based on clay's capacity for reuse. ''When a pot breaks,'' Anatsui has said, ''it's not the end of its useful life.'' To Anatsui, breakage was above all ''a condition for new growth.'' 
 At the end of the 1970s, Anatsui's growing prominence led to invitations to travel -- first to a sculpture conference in Toronto, where he saw contemporary Western art in the flesh for the first time (a Louise Nevelson sculpture), and then to a residency in rural Cummington, Mass., where he had an accidental epiphany: while using a chain saw to cut some wood, he was struck by the saw's sheer, unconstrained power. ''It's so easy, so fast, it has a tendency to get . . . expansive.'' He began to associate chain saw cuts with certain kinds of lines on a map -- the long, straight borders into which Western powers divvied up Africa in the 19th century, for instance. 
 Anatsui wasn't interested in making overtly political work -- ''taking sides,'' as he puts it. But his sense of the chain saw's metaphorical weight led him to return to working in wood. Over the next two decades, photographs of Anatsui at work in a visor and protective clothing, holding a heavy saw, would complement the abstract delicacy of his symbol-ornamented planks and stumps. This combination of power-tool machismo, scholarly symbology and organic material was a potent mix, but in retrospect, the work's variety can also seem discomfiting: Anatsui veered from gridlike abstractions to pictographs and even topical figuration. A piece called ''Visa Queue,'' from 1992, with its winding line of diminutive figures, is a carved cartoon about the travails of refugees or immigrants -- or even of newly itinerant artists, unused to the hassles of travel.
 African critics, who knew and championed Anatsui's work first, tend to emphasize its continuity. The wood, clay and metal cloth works are all ''part and parcel,'' says the Nigerian curator Okwui Enwezor, of his lifelong ''experimentation with materials -- materials that are meaningful in the context of the local culture.'' In the West, however, there is a divide between the earlier work, which can seem heavy-handed in its Africanness, and the new sculptures, which are more spectacular and, at the same time, subtler. An apparent fusion of Klimt and Christo, Seurat and Tuttle, Anatsui's wall hangings recall disparate Modernist sweet spots without quite settling into any familiar category. 
 Their most peculiar feature is that they are physically unfixed: 
 Anatsui insists that his hangings be draped rather than hung flat, but he doesn't insist on draping them himself, and in fact is perfectly happy to have galleries or museums do so. He has preferences -- horizontal ripples are better than vertical ones -- but he doesn't regard any particular arrangement as final. Naturally, professional curators are disconcerted by this freedom; Anatsui has little patience with their scruples. ''Museum people are trained not to be creative,'' Anatsui complains. ''I find that very frustrating.'' To Storr, the provisional, shifting shape of Anatsui's art is one of the keys to its originality. In the catalog to the coming Museum for African Art retrospective, Storr argues that Anatsui's work ''is fundamentally anti-monumental: it does not stand its ground. . . . Rather it takes the shape of circumstances and so epitomizes contingency.'' For Storr, that is no minor innovation: Anatsui ''opens a new chapter in the history of sculpture.'' It's possible that the appetite for ''contingency'' that Storr praises is particularly African. Lisa Binder, the curator in charge of the Anatsui exhibition, points out that ''traditional African objects, unlike European paintings and sculpture, are often highly adaptable, designed to be reused.'' Anatsui's work brings this adaptable, unfixed quality into sculptural practice -- as jazz brought an African ''unfixedness'' into Western music.
 Anatsui's studio, a small warehouse near the Nsukka campus, is now a virtual factory: instead of waiting to find discarded bottle caps, he buys them in bulk from neighboring distilleries. More than a dozen assistants, young men in their 20s, work six days a week cutting and folding the aluminum pieces, and then joining these into blocks. When he feels ready, Anatsui has them laid out on the cement floor and begins to compose a new sculpture. If he is happy with the results, the blocks are wired together and the finished work is folded up like a blanket. If he is not satisfied, he simply says, ''Pick them up.'' 
 On a recent afternoon, I drove with Anatsui and Susan Vogel, who is filming a documentary about him, from the crowded studio back to the quiet, grassy hill where he happened upon the first bag of bottle tops. At the site where he had found them, there was a scattering of colored aluminum -- crushed and dusty but probably, Anatsui agreed, remnants of the original bag. We stood at the spot, talking about his long career. Anatsui is an almost preternaturally calm man, reserved and modest, but also firm in his views. At one point, Vogel asked whether Anatsui felt satisfied by his recent success. There was a pause. ''Oh, no,'' Anatsui answered. ''My ambition is . . . to get better.'' He spoke briefly about artists he admires: Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor, James Turrell. ''I'm not there yet.'' He continued with a faint smile, ''I know there's more room up there.'' ALEXI WORTH

HEADLINE: The Big Test Before College? Filling Out the Financial Aid Form

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Most everyone agrees that something is very wrong with the six-page federal form for families seeking help with college costs. 
 Created in 1992 to simplify applying for financial aid, it has become so intimidating -- with more than 100 questions -- that critics say it scares off the very families most in need, preventing some teenagers from going to college.
Then, too, some families have begun paying for professional help with the form, known as the Fafsa,a situation that experts say indicates just how far awry the whole process has gone. 
 ''We're getting thousands of calls a day,'' said Craig V. Carroll, chief executive of Student Financial Aid Services Inc., whose fafsa.com charges $80 to $100 to fill out the form. ''Our calls for the month of January are up about 35 percent from last year. There's been a huge increase in the desperation of families.'' 
 Last year, Congress ordered the form streamlined, but in the very same bill it added seven new questions. Critics say that even when all those questions are answered, the form does a poor job of assessing financial worth, both because it excludes assets like cars, boats, the family home and some family businesses, and because it does not factor in the high cost of living in areas like New York. 
 On the campaign trail, President Obama promised to eliminate the form -- officially, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. And his secretary of education, Arne Duncan, talked about the problem at his confirmation hearing, saying, ''You basically have to have a Ph.D. to figure that thing out.'' 
 But whether it will be replaced soon, and with what, remains an open question. 
 Between the recession and the rising cost of college, more families than ever are filing the forms this year, their first step toward Pell grants, Stafford loans, Perkins loans, work-study programs and much state aid. As of Feb. 15, the Department of Education had already received 2,213,408 forms, 20 percent more than at this time last year.
 Some researchers have found that the form could be drastically simplified without any great impact on students' aid eligibility. But experts warn that if the form becomes too simple, some states and universities might create new forms to get additional information. 
 ''In the long run, I think the Fafsa will get easier,'' said Lauren Asher, acting president of the Institute for College Access and Success. ''But not this year.''
 The Department of Education is considering two approaches to simplifying the form, said Robert Shireman, founder of the institute and currently a consultant to Mr. Duncan. One, proposed by former Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings in a Jan. 16 letter to Congress, would cut out most financial questions, asking only for adjusted gross income and the number of tax exemptions. Her sample form is two pages and has fewer than 30 questions. (The current form, with accompanying instructions, has more than five times as many words as this article.) 
 The other approach, favored by Ms. Asher and others, would let taxpayers direct the Internal Revenue Service to share information from their tax returns with the Education Department. 
 ''It's not yet been decided which way to go,'' Mr. Shireman said. ''One way is simple, using very few data elements, and the question is whether that's enough. The other approach gets a little more data, but has the drawback that not everyone files taxes, especially lower-income people. And it raises some timing questions, since the Fafsa starts in January, and the information the I.R.S. has at that point is from the prior tax year.'' 
 While some pilot projects may be ready for next year's application season, he said, transforming the whole system will not be that quick, particularly since some changes would require Congressional action. 
 ''One thing we will have, by August, is a Government Accountability Office analysis of the effects of the different options,'' Mr. Shireman said.
 The form becomes available each year on Jan. 1, and counselors urge families to file early because some aid is first come first served. 
 Free help for filing is widely available, from the Education Department, counselors and workshops like College Goal Sunday offering line-by-line guidance.
 ''It's daunting,'' said Janette Logan, a Connecticut mother who had her daughter, Kate Brown, in tow recently at College Goal Sunday at Norwalk Community College. ''Kate met her deadlines in applying for college, and now this is mine.''
 But after about an hour in the computer room, Ms. Logan realized that she did not have all the necessary information, so she and her daughter left without submitting the form. As the afternoon wore on, many families drifted away without finishing. 
 ''I didn't bring everything I need, but at least I know what to do now,'' said Gary Curto, who had researched the form on the Internet, landed at fafsa.com, assumed it was the official government site and nearly paid for help. 
 ''I was just about to pay, but my wife knew it was supposed to be free,'' he said.
 But Brigid Duffy, a mother of four in Lynn, Mass., decided the help was worth the cost.
 ''I know it sounds silly, but what appealed to me was that you could be done in 20 minutes,'' said Ms. Duffy, who used fafsa.com for her son Griffin's form. ''I'd done the Fafsa myself in the past, for my 22-year-old, and it took five or six hours. It's not fun.''
 Without help, however, many give up. ''Students who would be eligible for aid see how complex the form is, get what I call 'form fright' and just stop,'' said Pat Watkins, director of financial aid at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Fla.
 Many affluent families now use high-priced financial advisers to maximize their eligibility for financial aid. Kalman A. Chany, the president of Campus Consultants Inc., attracts many families to his $1,450 service through financial aid presentations for parents at dozens of New York schools, including Dalton, Horace Mann and Brooklyn Tech. 
 ''We've had a lot more people sign up this year, especially since October,'' said Mr. Chany, whose clients' children often apply to private colleges that require both the Fafsa and an even more detailed form, the College Board's CSS Profile. 
 ''We're not like the services that just take the data and put it on the form,'' said Mr. Chany, author of ''Paying for College Without Going Broke.'' ''We analyze the clients' situation and then tell them, 'If you change this, your financial aid picture could be different.' '' 
 Each current proposal for revising the federal aid form has drawbacks -- and detractors. 
 ''The financial aid community wants precision, and a formula that accurately assesses ability to pay, so there's resistance to any approach that's simpler but less precise,'' said Mark Kantrowitz, president of finaid.org, a financial aid site. ''There's also a very real concern that if you discard the questions the states, or certain institutions, wanted answered, they'll create their own financial aid forms, putting us right back where we were before the Fafsa.''

HEADLINE: A Lonely and Bleak Existence in the West, Tending the Flock

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

DATELINE: ROCK SPRINGS, Wyo. 

 BODY:
Somewhere in Wyoming's vast, barren sagebrush country, Lorenzo Cortez Vargas pokes his head out of the rickety camper where he lives and stares into the dirt. 
 Mr. Vargas, a sheepherder from Chile, spends his days and nights on lonesome stretches of the Rockies, driving 2,000 sheep across Colorado and Wyoming as part of a federal temporary worker program he signed up for more than a year ago. 
 But like the other sheepherders, or ''borregueros,'' in the West, Mr. Vargas has barely any contact with his new country, where he earns $750 a month for working round the clock without a day off.
 He lives alone in the crude 5-foot-by-10-foot ''campito'' with no running water, toilet or electricity, save for a car battery he has rigged to a small radio. A sputtering wood-burning stove is his only source of heat in winter, a collection of faded telephone cards his only connection to home. 
 ''They never tell you exactly what it's going to be like,'' Mr. Vargas, 28, said in Spanish. ''But you've got to stick it out here. What are you going to do?'' 
 Sheepherding has long occupied the bottom rung of migrant labor. Most borregueros speak no English; many have only a vague idea of where they are and no knowledge of their legal rights as documented immigrants. The herders enter the country under the H-2A temporary agricultural worker program, which allows companies to hire foreigners if no Americans want their jobs. 
 The harsh, solitary lives of foreign sheepherders in the American West have remained virtually unchanged for more than a century. And government oversight of their circumstances remains piecemeal.
 Ranchers say that paying the workers more would crush an industry long in decline. But over the past year, legal and immigrant rights groups have begun a campaign to improve the treatment of borregueros in Colorado and Wyoming, states where their plight is particularly unforgiving. 
 ''It's like going back in time,'' said Thomas Acker, a Spanish professor at Mesa State College in Grand Junction, Colo., who hopes to persuade the state legislature to raise herders' wages and to require ranchers to improve their standard of living. ''That these men are required to live under these conditions for such long periods is inhumane.'' 
 Their ramshackle campitos often leave the men exposed to the bone-chilling winds and searing summers of the high desert and mountain regions where they toil. Miles from even the smallest town, sheepherders bathe with melted snow or water that is trucked in and use shovels to bury their waste. They eat canned food and the occasional meat, which is also hauled in by ranch workers, but the food often freezes in the winter and spoils in the summer.
 ''The living conditions are bad,'' Jose Ruiz, a former sheepherder from Chile, said in Spanish. ''The food is bad. The access to bathrooms, showers is nothing. In some ranches, it's horrible.'' 
 Since the end of the 19th century, men from the Basque region of Spain have been herding sheep in the American West, attracted by a shortage of local workers who would endure such a life. William A. Douglass, emeritus professor of Basque studies at the University of Nevada, Reno, said in an interview that sheepherding ''placed a man in a situation which at times bordered on total social isolation.'' 
 By the mid-1980s, with improved economic conditions in Basque country, ranchers turned mostly to South American sheepherders who qualified for H-2A visas. 
 Because the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 exempted sheepherders from having to be paid the minimum wage, the Labor Department has relied on statewide surveys to determine their prevailing wage. In Wyoming, ranches pay herders $650 a month. Colorado ranches, like the one Mr. Vargas works for, pay $750. 
 Peter Orwick, the executive director of the American Sheep Industry Association, said that because of the growing cost of fuel, feed and other necessities, the number of sheep raised by ranchers had declined by 60 percent since 1993. Paying higher wages to the 1,500 sheepherders working in the United States would force many ranches to close, Mr. Orwick said, adding that sheepherders fare better here than in their home countries. 
 ''Because they get food and board, they have no fixed costs other than their phone and postage,'' Mr. Orwick said. ''If it weren't an attractive job for them, they wouldn't be here.''
 Besides low pay, Mr. Ruiz said, sheepherders endure harsh working conditions and sometimes abusive treatment from the ranchers who hire them. 
 Over the past decade, the Wage and Hour Division of the Labor Department has conducted more than 100 investigations into mistreatment of sheepherders. But because of the itinerant nature of their work, it is nearly impossible to study and document what is occurring. Colorado and Wyoming inspect campitos annually, but federal standards require only the barest amenities. 
 ''The first thing that comes to mind is that this is a modern day form of indentured servitude,'' said Jennifer Lee, a lawyer with Colorado Legal Services, which has been lobbying for improvements. ''It is shocking how these men live.''
 Of seven sheepherders interviewed, four said they had not been paid, despite being on the job up to eight months. Current and former sheepherders told of contracting tick-borne illnesses and also of sustaining serious injuries after being thrown from horses. Rarely, they said, did they receive prompt medical treatment.
 Virtually all the herders agreed that their working and living conditions were worse than in their home countries but that they needed the money. Wages here, they said, ranged from slightly to significantly more than they earned in South America.
 Most borregueros are too frightened of losing their jobs and of being punished to complain, Ms. Lee said, and rarely do they know whom to complain to other than their bosses.
 In 2000, the Labor Department filed a lawsuit accusing a Colorado ranch, John Peroulis & Sons Sheep, of beating, starving and exploiting its sheepherders for 10 years. But a settlement required the ranchers only to pay back wages and a $3,000 fine and to submit a manual on how to treat workers.
 Last year, Colorado Legal Services filed six complaints with the department on behalf of sheepherders, accusing ranchers of providing abysmal working conditions. In one, a sheepherder said he became so hungry that he ate part of a rotting elk carcass. According to the complaint, his boss accused him of poaching the animal and dropped him off at a local immigration office for deportation. A federal agent there took pity on the man, bought him lunch and helped him contact the state labor department, the complaint said.
 Dennis Richins, the executive director of the Western Range Association, a ranching group that recruits sheepherders to the United States, said any rancher caught mistreating a sheepherder was thrown out of the group.
 Mr. Richins, a rancher himself, acknowledged that working conditions were tough but said they would be difficult to improve because sheepherding was so transitory and remote. ''It's a hard, lonely life,'' he said. ''But why do the sheepherders want to come back a second or third time if things are so bad?''
 On a recent weekend, Dr. Acker, the Spanish professor, led a group documenting the lives of Western sheepherders to various campitos in southwestern Wyoming, perched alone or in pairs on the horizon like covered wagons. The bleary-eyed herders were shocked to see the group. Most are not allowed to have visitors, not that many people go to such desolate territory. 
 Grateful for the visitors and what they brought, the men smiled, clasped their hands and dived into the winter clothes and fresh fruit that Dr. Acker handed out. 
 One sheepherder, who would not give his name because he feared reprisal from his boss, said the unending loneliness made his life hard. ''I think about my family,'' he said quietly. ''I sometimes think I'd like to go back just to be with my family.''

HEADLINE: Need an Office Tower? Try the Auctions

BYLINE: By AMY CORTESE

 BODY:
IN a dismal real estate environment, one segment of the market is actually booming these days: the auction business. 
 Sales generated through auctions -- including residential, commercial and agricultural properties -- totaled $58.6 billion in 2008, up 38 percent from $42.3 billion in 2003, according to a recently released tally by the National Auctioneers Association, a trade group based in Overland Park, Kan. 
 Most of the recent activity and attention has focused on the residential sector, with an increasing number of homeowners being forced into foreclosure. But commercial auctions are expected to pick up this year as property owners and developers seek to raise cash to pay off loans or are forced into foreclosure themselves. 
 ''We've seen two years of residential downturn,'' said David E. Gilmore, a managing partner at the Sperry Van Ness Accelerated Marketing Company, an auction and brokerage firm with offices in several states. Noting that commercial real estate generally lags behind residential by 18 to 24 months in a downturn, Mr. Gilmore added, ''We're there.'' 
 The research firm Real Capital Analytics estimates that there are 5,227 troubled, potentially troubled or lender-possessed commercial assets in the United States, valued at around $124 billion. 
 One of them is the John Hancock Tower in Boston, which is set to go on the auction block next month. The dire turn of events came after Broadway Partners, based in New York, which bought the tower in 2006 for $1.3 billion, defaulted in January on some loans, prompting a group of mezzanine lenders to hire Green Loan Services, a unit of SL Green, to pursue an auction. (Mezzanine loans are secured by a stake in ownership rather than the actual property; they have become increasingly popular over the last several years of high-leverage deal making.)
 Barring any last-minute negotiations by Broadway Partners to stave off foreclosure, the tower -- 60 stories high and designed by I. M. Pei -- is set to be sold to the highest bidder on March 31, using a special sealed-bid auction. 
 ''When the house of cards comes falling down, mezzanine lenders are the first to get hit,'' said Edward J. Hunter, the chairman of Lowenstein Sandler's real estate practice group, who foresees a wave of these situations, known as Uniform Commercial Code foreclosures. 
 Michael A. Fine, the executive vice president and director of project management for Sheldon Good & Company, a commercial auction house based in Chicago that pioneered commercial real estate auctions in the late 1960s, says his company has seen a surge in calls since mid-January from interested commercial sellers. After a slow year in 2008, which he chalked up to frozen credit and general inertia in commercial real estate, Mr. Fine says indications are that ''this will be a very strong year for us.'' 
 Auction houses are poised for a growing role in commercial real estate. The strengths of the auction model -- a faster sales cycle, lower costs, and the ability to quickly determine a fair market value -- play into current market conditions. 
 ''It's tough to put your finger on a price right now,'' said Randy Wells, the president of the National Auctioneers Association. He said that comparable sales and listings could be consulted ''but it's guesswork right now,'' and that auctions ''are really good at finding a current market value in a short amount of time.'' 
 In addition, Mr. Wells said, commercial property can be easier to auction than residential. ''Commercial property usually doesn't have an emotional attachment,'' he said. ''It's numbers.'' 
 Using traditional real estate listings, commercial properties may take months or years to sell, as buyers wait for a bottom. But that time on the market can be costly. Even as a building sits idle, its owner faces substantial carrying costs each month, including interest on loans, taxes and maintenance. And in a declining market, the value of a real estate asset can deteriorate with time, said Dean Williams, owner of Williams & Williams, an auction house in Tulsa, Okla., that holds around 300 auctions a month across the country. 
 Mr. Williams and other auctioneers note that many sellers are hesitant to part with their properties at less than their desired price. But when the carrying costs are factored in, a quick sale, even at a lower-than-desired price, can make economic sense. 
 A typical commercial real estate auction takes 12 weeks -- from marketing to auction to closing -- potentially trimming months of carrying costs. They can be held live, via the Internet or a combination of both, as well as through sealed bids. The seller may or may not specify a minimum, or reserve, price. And, unlike the case with some residential fire sales, there is ample opportunity for potential bidders to conduct inspections and due diligence.
 ''We turn real estate assets into liquid assets very quickly,'' said Mr. Fine of Sheldon Good.
 Large developers have recently embraced auctions as a way to sell large numbers of condominium units at once. This is especially helpful because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage finance agencies, require that at least half of a development be sold before closings can commence. 
 One developer, Downtown Properties Holdings of Los Angeles, sold 63 condos, out of a total 79, in three hours through an Internet-based auction earlier this month. The loft units, in the Rowan Building in downtown Los Angeles, sold for an average of 8 percent above the reserve price, according to William Stevenson, who runs the auction company Intelligent Market Systems, and who acted as a broker for the developer.
 On the flip side, auctioneers say that there is little they can do for a seller with unreasonable expectations or a property without a market. 
 Circuit City, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November, tried to auction its store leases but canceled that sale because of a lack of bidders. After failing to auction off the company as a whole in January, the retailer is in the process of liquidating. Some auctioneers say the lease terms and high opening bids were deal breakers. But for the right properties, ''there are a lot of buyers out there,'' Mr. Wells said. ''You couldn't find better interest rates.'' 
 Many auctioneers chafe at the negative connotations associated with real estate auctions, noting that auctions have been used successfully in sales of healthy properties as well. Auction proponents say they believe that they provide a better model for valuing all types of real estate and more efficiently handling transactions, and see a vital role for auctions long after the economy has recovered.
 ''The real estate auction in the U.S. has primarily been about liquidations and fire sales,'' said Mr. Williams of Williams & Williams. ''I'm interested in more efficient trade and less waste.'' 
 Mr. Fine agreed. ''With every cycle in the real estate business, more credibility is built,'' he said. ''As markets improve, auctions remain as a more viable model and a great alternative marketing approach.''

HEADLINE: Xanadu, Perhaps a Folly For Our Times

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 

 BODY:
 In 1797, from the depths of an opium dream, the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge emerged with an epic poem about a fantastical paradise. He set about putting its 200 to 300 lines on paper, but, as he told it, after being interrupted by someone with business to transact, he was able to reconstruct only a small, mystical fragment. The rest, gone forever.
 The poem was not published until 1816, but it went on to become one of the most famous, if somewhat incomprehensible, reveries ever written. 
 In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
 A stately pleasure-dome decree:
 Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
 Through caverns measureless to man
 Down to a sunless sea.
 There have been many Xanadus over the years, none of them up to Kubla Khan standards. In ''Citizen Kane,'' Xanadu was the estate of Charles Foster Kane, which is never completed and falls into ruin -- ''the costliest monument a man has built to himself.''
 In 1980, it was the dopey movie with memorably bad music, later spoofed on Broadway, about a Greek muse who descends to Venice Beach from Mount Olympus to inspire the first roller disco.
 The latest Xanadu, sprouting off the New Jersey Turnpike, looking like the world's biggest air vent, built with mismatched tiles, will never be called ''stately.'' And yet, if Xanadu is all about the truly impossible dream, what better pleasure dome for our season in economic hell than Xanadu, the two-million-square-foot retail and entertainment center in the Meadowlands that may or may not open in August?
 Forget Alph. Walking through the largely finished shell of the project -- Miley Cyrus cavorting on a giant television screen as workers laid tiles below, multicolor LED lights above -- is to be transported to the strangest dream world of them all, the vision of unlimited commercial merriment that was the world we lived in just a year ago.
 Who knows when or if we will see the 16-story indoor Snow Park, the 286-foot-tall Pepsi Globe Ferris wheel, the simulated sky-diving contraption, the MagiQuest virtual-reality game. You don't need Coleridge's opium to spy the outlines of a sprawling history of modern commerce and New Jersey politics in the deals and dodges, toxic history, corporate failures and corporate rescues it took to get Xanadu to the brink of existence only to have it run into economic catastrophe. Calling Tom Wolfe! 
 YEARS ago, the talk was of an opening in late 2007. Plans to open last November were pushed back to this August. Now officials are wavering on that. It's hard to tell what's worse, a humdrum partial opening (officials claim Xanadu is 70 percent leased; others are skeptical) or the stink of a project that keeps getting pushed back into the future.
 There are plenty of skeptics. To Jeff Tittle, the head of the New Jersey Sierra Club, Xanadu is a redundant monument to New Jersey's pay-to-play culture, New Jersey's Mall to Nowhere. 
 Howard Davidowitz, the chairman of Davidowitz & Associates, a national retail consulting firm and investment bank, said the concept of mixed entertainment and retail at the Meadowlands was a high-stakes idea that might have succeeded in a better economy.
 ''We're going to close 220,000 retail stores this year,'' he said. ''Who's doing well? Family Dollar. Dollar Tree. Wal-Mart, McDonald's. Netflix. Consumers have no money. This is the total opposite of what's succeeding. It's not viable in this market.''
 Project officials said the building would be finished this year, but they were still evaluating when it would open. John Samerjan, a spokesman for the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, said the timing was less important than the compelling logic of a unique attraction in one of the most desirable locations in the country. 
 ''Nobody invests two billion dollars for a one-year window,'' he said. ''Looking out toward 2010 or whenever we've gone through this and the economy upticks, with all that's going on, Xanadu, the new rail link, the new stadium, we're going to be in an amazing place.''
 And it is sort of amazing, our own ''sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice,'' signs in vast empty spaces with their come-ons -- Forever 21, Guess, Adrenalina. It's not Coleridge's Xanadu. But, for better or worse, it is ours.
 We tend to remember Coleridge's glorious dream of Xanadu, but in the end, it's about a place not reached -- not even quite remembered. ''Beware! Beware!'' we're reminded at the end, the kind of warning we never quite heed, that Xanadu always seems somehow within reach until, alas, it isn't.

HEADLINE: Enlisting Fish and Chips To Fight Climate Change

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: NUNEATON, England 

 BODY:
As he has done frequently over the last 18 months, Andy Roost drove his blue diesel Peugeot 205 onto a farm, where signs pointed one way for ''eggs'' and another for ''oil.'' 
 He unscrewed the gas cap and chatted nonchalantly as Colin Friedlos, the proprietor, poured three large jugs of used cooking oil -- tinted green to indicate environmental benefit -- into the Peugeot's gas tank. 
 Mr. Friedlos operates one of hundreds of small plants in Britain that are processing, and often selling to private motorists, used cooking oil, which can be poured directly into unmodified diesel cars, from Fords to Mercedes. 
 Last year, when the price of crude oil topped $147 a barrel, a number of large companies in Europe and the United States were spurred to set up plants to collect and refine used cooking oil into biodiesel. 
 The global recession and the steep drop in oil prices have now killed many of those large refining ventures. But smaller, simpler ones like Mr. Friedlos's are moving in to fill the void with their direct-to-tank product, having been deluged by offers of free oil from restaurants. 
 A tumble of tin containers now sit on the farm. Some dealers here offer fill-ups in suburban yards and barns. Others -- like John Nicholson, founder of a small company in Wales -- deliver jugs of green car fuel to the doors of hundreds of customers, much like a vehicular milkman. 
 Used cooking oil has attracted growing attention in recent years as a cleaner, less expensive alternative to fossil fuels for vehicles. In many countries, including the United States, the oil is collected by companies and refined into a form of diesel. Some cities use it in specially modified municipal buses or vans. And the occasional environmentalist has experimented with individually filtering the oil and using it as fuel. 
 Here, however, the direct-to-the-tank approach is gaining a bit of mainstream popularity, attracting people like Mr. Roost, on his way to work, dressed in a suit. The oil, he said, is ''good for the environment and it's cheaper than diesel, even now that prices have dropped.'' It costs $4.88 per gallon, which is about 10 percent less than diesel costs now -- and about one-third less than diesel cost at its peak last year. Used cooking oil will never erase the need for filling stations, nor will it, by itself, reverse climate change, transportation experts say.
 ''You can't eat enough French fries'' to serve all the cars driven in the West, said Peder Jensen, a transport specialist at the European Environment Agency. At most, he said, cooking oil might supplant a few percent of diesel fuel consumption. But he said that it was one of many small adjustments that, added together, could have an important effect on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. 
 Dr. Jensen said that cooking oil fuel was ''feasible'' for diesel engines -- Rudolf Diesel predicted that his engine, patented in the 1890s, would run on it -- and that it was, ''from an environmental point of view, a good idea, taking this waste and making it useful.'' 
 The main barriers to the widespread use of cooking oil, Dr. Jensen said, are ''structural,'' like the lack of standards for processing the fuel and adapting and maintaining vehicles to run on it. 
 Others disagree. Stuart Johnson, manager of engineering and environment at Volkswagen of America, called putting raw vegetable oil in cars ''a bad idea'' and said, ''We don't recommend it.'' The inconsistent quality of cooking oil fuel, he said, means that ''it may contain impurities and it may be too viscous,'' especially for newer, more complex diesel engines with injection systems.
 None of that seems to stir concern in Mr. Nicholson, the Welsh entrepreneur. He said he first poured vegetable oil from his kitchen into the family car eight years ago, when the filling stations were emptied by a gas crisis. His wife, a nurse, had to get to work. 
 Over the next few years, he experimented with different techniques and started Bio-Power (UK), a national umbrella group to assist small producers like himself. 
 ''People say, 'I've got no choice but the regular filling station, and they sell only fossil fuel,' '' Mr. Nicholson said. ''You've got to think differently. This does challenge the status quo.'' 
 Many diesel vehicles, particularly older models, run fine on cooking oil and do not need adaptation, he said. He said that he was lucky the car his wife was driving was ''tolerant.'' 
 But Dr. Jensen said it was safer to adapt cars for cooking oil use, an adjustment that can be done for about $300 and involves putting in a small heater to pre-warm fuel so that it is thinner, and installing injection nozzles that are somewhat wider. Thousands of kits have been sold in Europe and the United States, though it is illegal in America to sell cars that have been adapted. 
 But Dr. Jensen cautioned that drivers who used cooking oil fuel were taking a risk and might lose their warranty protection. 
 Vegetable oil is cleaner than either gas or diesel, producing virtually no carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas linked to climate change, and far fewer of the tiny airborne particles in pollution that are harmful to human health. But if the cooking oil is not adequately filtered or prepared for use in cars, studies show, it can also produce high levels of another chemical, NOx, the main component of smog. 
 A directive of the European Union stipulating that all fuel at the pump should contain 5.75 percent biofuel by 2010 encouraged many large corporations to jump into the market. 
 In Scotland, for instance, Argent Oils set up the largest plant in the world, capable of collecting 330 million pounds of used cooking oil a year to produce 45 million gallons of biodiesel. 
 Nor has the movement been limited to Europe. Towns in Texas and other states have engaged companies like Biodiesel Industries to collect local oil and convert it to biodiesel for municipal vehicles. 
 Officials in Westchester County, N.Y., recently announced that they would collect cooking oil from restaurants for a fleet of modified vehicles, including a Veggie Van that travels to schools to educate students about biofuel diesel. 
 Producers like Mr. Friedlos have taken advantage of simpler brews and lower overhead. Instead of being refined with explosive chemicals at large factories, the oil is simply filtered and mixed with an additive to thin it and make it burn better. And transport costs are minimal.
 Used cooking oil is a problematic waste, which clogs sewers and pipes if tossed down the drain, forming huge, slimy stalactites in sewers, and killing wildlife if it gets into lakes and streams. In Britain, cooking oil cannot be sent to landfills. The oil was once used to make animal feed, but that is no longer allowed because of concerns about mad cow disease. 
 Two years ago, in the affluent London suburb of Leatherhead, Chris Leveritt starting filtering oil from his restaurant, Trattoria Vecchia, to run the family car. He is now creating a small commercial factory to produce 132 gallons a day in his backyard. Mr. Leveritt's partner, a wine distributor, picks up jugs of used oil when he delivers wine to dozens of restaurants in and around London. 
 In Wales, Mr. Nicholson delivers cooking oil to the National Trust, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and about 300 other customers, who like it because it contains no fossil fuel. 
 But still, many motorists hesitate, Mr. Leveritt said. ''There is a lot of resistance,'' he said, ''to putting something into your precious car that you brewed in the kitchen sink.''

THERE'S yet more evidence that it makes sense to invest in simple, plain-vanilla index funds, whose low fees often lead to better net returns than hedge funds and actively managed mutual funds with more impressive performance numbers.
 Basic stock market index funds generally aspire to nothing more than matching the returns of a market benchmark. So in a miserable year for stocks, index funds may not look very appealing. But it turns out that, after fees and taxes, it is the extremely rare actively managed fund or hedge fund that does better than a simple index fund. 
 That, at least, is the finding of a new study by Mark Kritzman, president and chief executive of Windham Capital Management of Boston. He presented his results in the Feb. 1 issue of Economics & Portfolio Strategy, a newsletter for institutional investors published by Peter L. Bernstein Inc.
 Mr. Kritzman, who also teaches a graduate course in financial engineering at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management, set up his study to accurately measure the long-term impact of all the expenses involved in investing in a mutual fund or hedge fund. Those include transaction costs, taxes and management and performance fees.
 He is not the first to try such a measurement. But, he said in an e-mail message, it is surprisingly hard to measure these costs accurately. The bite taken out by taxes, for example, depends on the specific combination of positive years and losing ones, as well as the order in which they occur. That combination and order also affect the performance fees charged by hedge funds.
 Mr. Kritzman devised an elaborate method to take such contingencies into account. Then he calculated the average return over a hypothetical 20-year period, net of all expenses, of three hypothetical investments: a stock index fund with an annualized return of 10 percent, an actively managed mutual fund with an annualized return of 13.5 percent and a hedge fund with an annualized return of 19 percent. The volatility of the three funds' returns -- along with their turnover rates, transaction fees and management and performance fees -- was based on what he determined to be industry averages. 
 Mr. Kritzman found that, net of all expenses, including federal and state taxes for a New York State resident in the highest tax brackets, the winner was the index fund.
 Specifically, he assumed that long-term capital gains were subject to a 15 percent federal tax and a 6.85 percent state tax; short-term capital gains and dividends were taxed at a combined federal and state rate of nearly 42 percent. The index fund's average after-expense return was 8.5 percent a year, versus 8 percent for the actively managed fund and 7.7 percent for the hedge fund. 
 Expenses were the culprit. For both the actively managed fund and the hedge fund, those expenses more than ate up the large amounts -- 3.5 and 9 percentage points a year, respectively -- by which they beat the index fund before expenses.
 IF such outperformance isn't enough to overcome the drag of expenses, what would do the trick? Mr. Kritzman calculates that just to break even with the index fund, net of all expenses, the actively managed fund would have to outperform it by an average of 4.3 percentage points a year on a pre-expense basis. For the hedge fund, that margin would have to be 10 points a year.
 The chances of finding such funds are next to zero, said Russell Wermers, a finance professor at the University of Maryland. Consider the 452 domestic equity mutual funds in the Morningstar database that existed for the 20 years through January of this year. Morningstar reports that just 13 of those funds beat the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by at least four percentage points a year, on average, over that period. That's less than 3 out of every 100 funds.
 But even that sobering statistic paints too rosy a picture, the professor said. That's because it's one thing to learn, after the fact, that a fund has done that well, and quite another to identify it in advance. Indeed, he said, he has found from his research that only a minority of funds that beat the market in a given year can outperform it the next year as well.
 Professor Wermers said he believed that it was ''exceedingly probable that any fund that has beaten the market by an average of more than one percentage point per year over the last decade achieved that return almost entirely due to luck alone.''
 ''By definition, therefore, such a fund could not have been identified in advance,'' he added.
 The investment implication is clear, according to Mr. Kritzman. ''It is very hard, if not impossible,'' he wrote in his study, ''to justify active management for most individual, taxable investors, if their goal is to grow wealth.'' And he said that those who still insist on an actively managed fund are almost certainly ''deluding themselves.''
 What if you're investing in a tax-sheltered account, like a 401(k) or an I.R.A.? In that case, Mr. Kritzman conceded, the odds are relatively more favorable for active management, because, in his simulations, taxes accounted for about two-thirds of the expenses of the actively managed mutual fund and nearly half of the hedge fund's. But he emphasized the word ''relatively.''
 ''Even in a tax-sheltered account,'' he said, ''the odds of beating the index fund are still quite poor.''

HEADLINE: Hard Times

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
''Lessons LearnedFromHard Times Past'' was a headline early this month in the business section of The Times; a week later, the gloomy phrase made the front page: ''In Renewed Hard Times, New Deal Architecture Faces Bulldozer.'' Next day, The Times's national page got into the act with ''Hard Times for Informal Home of Wyoming Politics.'' 
 Across the nation, The Los Angeles Times tried to cheer up readers in this parlous period with ''The Upside of Hard Times,'' and The Wall Street Journal contributed ''Hard Truths for Hard Times.'' Other headline writers around the world use the phrase in putting up a brave front: ''Estonian Builder Merko: Hard Times Offer Good Opportunities,'' the Baltic News Service reported; ''Challenge of Hard Times Brings Out the Best of Us'' was presented with a wan smile in The Courier-Mail of Australia. 
 Because we are going to have to live with this lugubrious marriage of words in months to come (along with parlous, a hifalutin variant of ''perilous''), it might offer some comfort to unbutton the frayed collar of its extensive etymology.
 In the year 1390, more than six centuries ago, the poet John Gower -- whose genes somehow escaped transmission to modern business cyclists -- wrote, ''It hath ben sene and felt full ofte/The harde time after the softe.'' That prophetic observation is in the O.E.D. under the sense of hard, meaning ''difficult to bear or endure,'' but the time is singular; we're looking for hard times, stretching the length of economic discomfort. 
 I am no numismatist, but I have picked up a few old coins that sometimes offer clues about the origin of words. One is a worn copper token, about the size of a nickel, on which is inscribed ''Millions for Defense'' around the edge, and ''NOT ONE CENT for Tribute'' in the middle. This was the rallying remark at a Philadelphia dinner honoring John Marshall in 1798. It was made by Robert Goodloe Harper, a Federalist politician from South Carolina who urged the U.S. to give that answer to France, which was seeking tribute for the protection of American merchant vessels. His hardheaded advice was taken up as the slogan against the Barbary pirates of 1800 and used by hardy hard-core hard-liners throughout U.S. history. On the envelope containing the old coin is written ''Hard Times token, 1837.'' 
 I passed that clue on to Ben Zimmer, executive producer of www.visualthesaurus.com and a longtime capo of the Phrasedick Brigade, with the suggestion that it may have to do with the populist President Andrew Jackson's assault on Philadelphia's Second Bank of the United States. Jackson liked ''hard'' money -- silver and gold, money you could bite, none of that soft, paper stuff being printed by private banks -- and was furious at the way rich merchants controlled much of the nation's money supply. As he turned the White House over to his vice president and acolyte, Martin Van Buren, the bottom fell out of the economy, inflation raged and the first Great Depression lasted five years. 
 ''The financial crisis of 1837 was indeed a high-water mark for hard times usage,'' Zimmer reports. ''I checked Gale's 19th Century U.S. newspapers database, and there are a whopping 375 articles from 1837 mentioning 'hard times,' 50 of them using the phrase in the headline of the article.'' (Times may change, but headline writers never let go of a short grabber.) ''The Washington Globe reported on April 29, 1837, 'Every paper we open contains some lamentable account of the pressure in the money market, and loud cries of hard times.' That's when the Panic of 1837 began in earnest. In May, banks suspended the payment of hard money, and small change disappeared from circulation, leading to the production of 'Hard Times' tokens.'' (That accounts for the NOT ONE CENT on my token, to distinguish a coin issued by a private bank from a government-issued cent.) 
 While he was at it -- Netymologists are compulsive diggers -- Zimmer provided a citation in the Early English Books Online database from a 1598 poem, ''The Complaint of Poetry for the Death of Liberality,'' by Richard Barnfield. Its plaintive question is echoed these days by journalists induced to take buyouts as well as literary lights dimmed by darkling publishers: ''But who can live with words, in these hard times?''
 The collocation echoes through the centuries after bright bubbles of euphoria pop and dismal days of dysphoria spread. When the Broadway musical star Christine Ebersole recently made a supper-club appearance at the Cafe Carlyle in New York, she stopped the show with a song composed by Stephen Foster, not your latest hot songwriter. The selection was not his dreamy ''Beautiful Dreamer,'' the classic ''Old Black Joe,'' the romantic ''Jeanie With the Light Brown Hair'' or the rousing ''Oh! Susanna.'' The sad song that the chanteuse chose to move a bejeweled audience nibbling its nails about impending impoverishment was one that Foster wrote in 1855, when he was going through a rough patch in his personal and professional life. The composer had surely remembered the previous generation's shuttered banks and worthless paper money, as his lyric pleaded: ''Hard Times, Come Again No More.''
 The letter that gives the phrase its fearsome economic meaning is the concluding s. Prisoners on long sentences do hard time; students corrected by ultraprescriptive grammarians say, ''Don't give me a hard time.'' Only short sellers, prophets of gloom and doom and unimaginative headline writers profit in hard times.

HEADLINE: Where Have All the Buyers Gone?

BYLINE: By MARGARET FARLEY STEELE

DATELINE: Greenwich 

 BODY:
 LORY GAMBRILL put her colonial-style house here on the market in September, the day after the government announced its takeover of the mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. At $1.75 million, it was considered well priced for the neighborhood, which boasts newer, larger homes -- and Carlos Delgado of the New York Mets among the neighbors. 
 She expected it to be snapped up. ''My broker told me it wouldn't even make it to the open house,'' Ms. Gambrill said. 
 Seventy real estate agents attended the open house in October, but over the next five months it was shown only seven or eight times, she said. She rejected an offer of about $400,000 below asking price. ''It's impossible -- no one is buying anything,'' she said recently. This month, Ms. Gambrill asked her broker to take the house off the market temporarily. 
 Because of the mortgage crisis, layoffs and lack of consumer confidence, her story is being duplicated across the state. Housing prices have rolled back to 2004 levels, and will probably not level off until 2010, said Timothy M. Warren Jr., chief executive of the Warren Group in Boston, which tracks New England real estate sales.
 The impact of the decline in sales as well as prices has been felt from Greenwich to Woodstock in the northeast corner of the state, and represents the steepest falloff in about 20 years, Mr. Warren said. There was not one month in 2008 in which sales increased from the previous year, his data showed.
 Statewide, sales of single-family homes plunged 23.66 percent last year and prices fell 9.15 percent, the data showed. In Fairfield County, the hardest hit, sales were down 31.27 percent and prices plummeted 11.97 percent. 
 ''The kiss of death are those great big houses,'' said Ginny Green, an agent with Wheeler Real Estate in Darien, who has been in the business 33 years. Homes of 7,000 square feet or more, once a coveted size for masters of the universe looking to buy in the area, are now sitting on the market for months or longer, she said. 
 And as the fortunes of local financiers founder, brokers expect more high-end homes to be put up for sale in the spring. ''That's the buzz, at least,'' said Kathy Lawten, an agent with Country Living Associates in New Canaan, who said she was working twice as hard for half the money. 
 Darien took a major hit, with sales nose-diving 43.95 percent: Two hundred and thirteen homes sold in 2008, compared with 380 the previous year. The price drop was not as steep -- 3.38 percent, to $1,285,000 from $1,330,000 -- a sign that ''people aren't willing to bargain or can't afford to bargain,'' Mr. Warren said. 
 In New Canaan, sales fell 34.23 percent. According to Ms. Lawten, some sellers are going to great lengths to move their properties by offering decorating allowances and other incentives. To encourage real estate agents to attend open houses at his six unsold homes in Fairfield County, Steven Kerschner, a Norwalk developer, offered the agents a raffle for prizes that include a weeklong vacation in St. Thomas. 
 Other sellers are offering third-party home warranties as an incentive, said Dan Sperduto, the owner of Era Realty Pros in Niantic. 
 To sweeten the deal for agents on a three-bedroom colonial in Darien, Ms. Green urged the owner to increase the sales commission to 3 percent from 2 percent. ''I don't know if it will make a difference,'' she admitted. 
 ''A lot of people are renting,'' Ms. Green said. ''They are in paralysis.'' Even demand for waterfront homes has dried up in her area, she said.
 Would-be buyers seem to be waiting it out, watching to see what impact the stimulus package may have on the economy and monitoring both home prices and interest rates, said Barbara L. Pearce, chief executive of H. Pearce Company, a North Haven-based real estate firm. ''It's bad,'' she said. ''The only thing that works is to price your home correctly, and most people won't do that.''
 In Norwalk and Darien, ''buyers are there, at low, low prices,'' Ms. Green said. ''They're what we call bottom fishermen.'' 
 Home prices slid 5.3 percent last year in Norwalk -- to $500,000 from $528,000 in 2007 -- but the drop was smaller than that of most other Fairfield County towns: Prices declined more than 10 percent in Stamford, Stratford, Ridgefield and Trumbull, and 23.19 percent in Bridgeport. New Canaan's prices were down 7.72 percent and Westport's 9.43 percent.
 ''The upper end has been pretty slow,'' said Nancy Healy, the owner of Shore and Country Properties in Greenwich. This month, 155 homes were for sale there for $5 million or more, the top price at $95 million. Last year's sales dropped 40.22 percent, and the median price fell 11.25 percent, to $1.775 million from $2 million. 
 The news is not all bad, however. The start of the spring market has brought out buyers in some towns. ''There is pent-up demand, and young families are coming out of Manhattan,'' said Bill Andruss, a broker with Sotheby's International Realty in Greenwich. First-time buyers and corporate transfers are also shopping, agents said. 
 Some economists also see a glimmer of hope. When adjusted for deflation, the price decline is not as steep as it seems, said John M. Clapp, director of the University of Connecticut Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Studies. ''At the end of the year,'' he said, ''the state was losing ground less rapidly.''

HEADLINE: Everyone Loves Google, Until It's Too Big

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University. E-mail: stross@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE popularity of Google's search engine in the United States just grows and grows. In the past three years, its market share gains have even been accelerating, making some people wonder whether the company will eventually obliterate what remains of its competition in search.
 Certainly, antitrust scrutiny is a growing worry at the Googleplex. Last year, the company abandoned a proposed advertising pact with Yahoo when the Justice Department said it would file an antitrust lawsuit to block the deal. Last week, a small Web site operator, TradeComet.com, filed an antitrust suit against Google, accusing it of unfairly manipulating its advertising system to harm a potential competitor. 
 And when I asked to speak with Google's chief economist about why Google's market share gains were accelerating, Google's press office also gave me, unrequested, a second, separate appointment with Dana Wagner, the company's ''competition counsel'' -- that is, its point person on antitrust issues. 
 Google maintains that its lead in the Web search market is tenuous, saying that with a simple click of a mouse, a user's loyalty could evaporate at any moment. 
 But consider this: As recently as July 2005, Google was ahead of Yahoo in market share by just six percentage points, at 36.5 percent to 30.5 percent, according to comScore, the market research company. Today, however, that advantage is much wider, at 63 percent to 21 percent. 
 ''You almost feel sorry for Google,'' said Danny Sullivan, editor in chief of Search Engine Land. ''They're doing a good job and people are turning to them. But when they pass 70 percent share, people are going to be uncomfortable about Google becoming a monopoly.''
 Google does not register gains every month. The comScore numbers for January reflect a 0.5 percent drop in its share from December and a 0.5 percent gain for Yahoo. But according to Hitwise, another online measurement service, Google has already surpassed the 70 percent benchmark. It estimates that Google has 72 percent of the United States market, versus 17.9 percent for Yahoo. Microsoft's two search services, MSN and Live.com, constitute a distant third, at a combined 5.4 percent.
 Mr. Sullivan said that while Yahoo's search engine benefits from traffic from Yahoo Mail and other Yahoo sites, its ability to pull in search engine users from outside its own borders is relatively weak. 
 Many Web site owners who track where their visitors come from report that Google's search engine now refers 80 to 90 percent of their visitors. For instance, almost all visitors sent by search engines to Stack Overflow -- a community of software developers raising and answering programming questions -- are from Google. In January, Stack Overflow received more than three million visits referred by 22 search engines. Of those, 99.34 percent were from Google. 
 Jeff Atwood, a co-founder of Stack Overflow, said: ''I have no beef with Google. I like Google. But I'm concerned. If you project this trend forward four years, just follow the graph. A world in which there is no competition strikes me as unhealthy.''
 At Google, Hal Varian, its chief economist, and Mr. Wagner said that the public was not blindly loyal to any one search engine. They cited a recent survey by Forrester Research in which 55 percent of the adults polled used more than one search engine every week.
 ''You buy a car, use it for four years, and then you'll look around at your choices,'' Mr. Varian said. ''But for search, we're competing on a click-by-click basis.'' If more users are going to Google, he said, it's because they are concluding that Google's product is superior.
 Mr. Sullivan, who has been studying search engines since 1995, said that similar surveys have been done for many years -- and that they always fail to reflect that most people have a primary attachment to a single search engine. When users try an alternative, he said, they ''don't go into active taste-testing mode''; afterward, they revert to their favorite. ''Google is a habit,'' he said, ''and habits are very hard to break.''
 Both Yahoo and Microsoft contend that their search engines' results have achieved parity in quality with Google's, based on internal statistical measurements that they do not disclose publicly. But that matters little.
 ''Whether we're slightly ahead or slightly behind Google in core relevance is not a game changer in search,'' said Prabhakar Raghavan, Yahoo's chief search strategist.
 Yahoo's best opportunity, Mr. Raghavan said, is to offer radically new ways of presenting information that will help users finish whatever it is they started before the search, like finding a job or buying a plane ticket. ''People don't want to search; it's a digression,'' he said. ''They want to complete a task.''
 What Yahoo and Microsoft haven't been able to attain, however, is parity with the Google brand, which had become a formally recognized verb by 2002. Mr. Raghavan said he recognizes that Google is ''synonymous with search.'' 
 I asked Mr. Sullivan if we should deliberately spread our searches across several engines, doing our own small part to help keep competition alive. He said that such a campaign would not be sustainable. ''I'm probably going to continue to use the thing that I have a good relationship with, which is Google,'' he said. ''If you suggest that someone should go use Microsoft search, it's like saying 'You should go get a new best friend.'''

HEADLINE: Can We Spend Our Way to Recovery?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''Thirty Years Later, a Return to Stagflation'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 14), Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, argues that the stimulus plan will bring the combination of high inflation and high unemployment known as stagflation. 
 The stimulus plan is needed because the G.O.P.-controlled Congress, over two decades, siphoned funds from investments in the real growth engines of our economy. Prosperity is the reward for countries that invest in education, research and infrastructure. The collective will of the community, represented by the government, is the only player in the market to address these needs. 
 The reason there are billions of dollars of shovel-ready research and infrastructure projects throughout this country is that our innovators and forward thinkers have been snubbed for eight years in favor of less productive industries like banking and bombs.
 We are playing catch-up. I only hope it is enough.
 Jim Haviland Durham, N.C., Feb. 15, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Paul D. Ryan properly points to the lesson of the government-induced stagflation of the 1970s as the result of the same spending and borrowing policies of the ''stimulus'' plan. He also recognizes that the Federal Reserve's policies of manipulating interest rates and expanding the money supply were an essential cause of today's financial crisis.
 But instead of calling for reforms and cost controls for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, Mr. Ryan should propose drastic cuts in spending on these entitlements. 
 Government interference in the economy fundamentally caused today's crisis, and only more freedom -- more separation between state and economics -- will get us out of it.
 Joseph Kellard East Meadow, N.Y., Feb. 14, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Paul D. Ryan repeats the tired idea that when the Federal Reserve prints money for the government to spend on economic recovery, the result will be inflation because ''it is a situation in which too few goods are being chased by too much money.'' This is based on a false assumption that the output of the country will not increase when government lets contracts to businesses to produce more goods and services that will improve the productivity and health of our country.
 If there is significant unemployment and idle capacity in the private sector (and who can deny that there is?), then this deficit spending will not cause inflation. Rather, the ''printed'' money spent on a recovery plan creates profit opportunities that induce private enterprise to hire and produce more goods. Then there will be many more goods available for this money to chase and no inflation need occur.

 To the Editor:
 So we have ''a situation in which too few goods are being chased by too much money''? Maybe things are different in Paul D. Ryan's district in Wisconsin, but for the rest of the country too many goods are being chased by too little money. Just ask any retailer or manufacturer.
 Bill Sweeney Hilton Head Island, S.C., Feb. 14, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Paul D. Ryan thinks that we should stimulate the economy by lowering corporate taxes. The forgone tax revenues, in his view, are funds that corporations would use to stimulate economic growth.
 Economic growth takes place when businesses borrow to finance new or larger ventures. These ventures grow, repay the debt and then provide profits, wages and tax revenues. 
 The key element in this dynamic is not the earnings retained by corporations, but wage levels. The amount by which wages exceed the price of necessities determines whether or not commerce thrives. 
 We've corrupted this model by starving wages to fatten corporate earnings. This has been driven by low-wage outsourcing and masked by consumer credit. Ruin is the result. 
 The stimulus may start a recovery, but only rising wages worldwide can achieve a return to prosperity. Government largess, whether to corporations or consumers, cannot take the place of wage-driven discretionary consumer spending.
 Jim Woolsey Sierra Vista, Ariz., Feb. 14, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Japan's high corporate income taxes seem to be a bad thing, in Paul D. Ryan's view. But before Japan's economy imploded under the triple whammy of real estate speculation, shady banking practices and the adoption of American ''lean and mean'' business ideology, its high corporate tax rate was widely viewed as positive. 
 Because of the taxes, companies had little incentive to declare a profit, so they plowed their earnings into research and development and employee wages and benefits. This encouraged innovation and raised living standards all around.
 Karen Sandness Minneapolis, Feb. 14, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Paul D. Ryan discusses getting the economies of the world back on their feet as an obvious priority. But shouldn't we be asking ourselves, ''What's the point?'' 
 In the West, commerce has come to rely on new, unnecessary products' stimulating consumers. And when one product fades, it leaves behind a hunger for a new hit. Many of us invest our energy and creative gifts in this process; yet no one claims there is anything deep or meaningful here. 
 Even more important, the ever-expanding economic process is imposing unprecedented environmental costs. Over a mere decade, the collapse of civilization has moved from crackpot idea to something reasonable people can contemplate.
 Isn't it time for us to confront the question: What is actually our ''first priority''? Robert Levin Carmel, Calif., Feb. 14, 2009
 To the Editor:
 So, the current stimulus attempts will lead to stagflation. Well, given the choice between stagflation and depression, I'd choose stagflation without a second thought.

HEADLINE: Oil Slump? Just Another Reason to Pounce

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: SANA, Yemen 

 BODY:
 IT'S been a tough first year for Martin Deffontaines in this arid, impoverished and secluded country on the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula.
 Since moving here 13 months ago as the local manager for Total, the French oil giant, Mr. Deffontaines has seen his main export pipeline damaged by terrorists, endured devastating flash floods and sent expatriate families back home because of security concerns. 
 Despite these challenges, Mr. Deffontaines, a lanky, 43-year-old Parisian, doesn't appear overly anxious. Indeed, Yemen is a showcase for Total, whose experience here shows how far an oil company will go these days to unearth new energy supplies. 
 Because of the endlessly complicated interplay of geology and geopolitics, access to petroleum resources is increasingly constrained, costs have soared and energy projects are becoming more complex. Add the recent, dizzying collapse in oil prices to that picture, and you have a raft of companies rethinking their investments and scurrying to cut costs. 
 So Mr. Deffontaines was philosophical, and a little amused, when he recounted some of the challenges the company had faced here, like negotiating with tribal leaders and sending actors to remote villages to stage a play about the hazards of gas pipelines. In meetings with government officials to thrash out problems, participants typically chew khat, a mildly narcotic plant that is widely consumed in Yemen but banned in many places around the world.
 This is a country where tribes are often better armed than government troops, where piracy runs rampant along the coastline, and where many trappings of modern life are absent.
 The risks are so pervasive that Total employees can't travel around town without an escort and are not allowed to leave Sana, the Yemeni capital, on their own. A wave of attacks linked to Al Qaeda occurred last year, including suicide bombings at the United States Embassy in September that left almost 20 dead, 6 of them attackers. 
 But Total has still gained a strong foothold here. It will soon start shipping liquefied natural gas from the Gulf of Aden, completing a $4 billion project begun less than four years ago. Those shipments will make Yemen the newest member of the world's small club of gas exporters -- and earn the government as much as $50 billion in tax revenue over the next 25 years.
 ''If we can build this here, we can do it anywhere,'' says Stephane Venes, a construction manager at Total's natural gas plant in Balhaf, a coastal town. Building the plant required about 10,000 workers, a monumental endeavor in such an isolated place. It also meant building a 210-mile pipeline that had to snake through 22 different tribal lands and one of the world's most unforgiving deserts. 
 Such ''audace'' is precisely what Christophe de Margerie, Total's chief executive, says he would like to instill throughout his company. 
 ''I make a big distinction between being risky and being bold,'' says Mr. de Margerie, 57, in an interview at Total's headquarters in La Defense, the business district on the outskirts of Paris. 
 ''If you're in a desert without water, that's not bold, that's dumb,'' he says. ''If you storm out of the trenches with your sword drawn while machine guns fire at you, it's not bold, it's dumb. Times have changed.''
 Total doesn't have much choice but to charge ahead. Although it managed for years to expand its hydrocarbon production -- even as larger rivals like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell struggled to keep output from falling -- that run ended last year when it reported a production drop. 
 Like its competitors, Total now faces one of the sharpest downturns in the history of the oil business, with consumption collapsing and oil prices shedding 73 percent of their value since peaking in July. At the same time, public opinion is sharply divided about oil companies themselves as environmental concerns take an increasingly important place in debates about the future of the energy business. 
 With no domestic production but deep roots in the Middle East and Africa, Total -- as well as its longtime domestic rival Elf Aquitaine, which it acquired in 2000 -- has always been forced to blaze or bully its way through faraway lands. 
 It has struck deals in countries where few wished to do business, like Sudan and Myanmar, or sailed against the tide when it saw lucrative opportunities, as it did in Iran in the 1990s. Such forays have come with complications: in separate investigations, French judges have been examining Total's role in the United Nations oil-for-food program in Iraq, and whether it made secret payments to enter the Iranian market. 
 Total's appetite for risk has also turned it into the top-ranked Western oil company in Africa, and the second-largest in the Middle East, after Exxon. Total pumps an average of 2.3 million barrels of oil and gas a day, and it earned more than $15 billion last year.
 While the company has operations throughout the Middle East, some of its biggest bets in the region have not yet paid off. 
 During the 1990s, Total negotiated with the government of Saddam Hussein and laid the groundwork to eventually develop Iraqi oil fields. But now, some Iraqi officials prefer American companies to European ones and view Total with suspicion because of this past. In Iran, a political confrontation with the West has forced a reluctant Total to walk away -- at least for now -- from a multibillion-dollar investment to develop a huge natural gas field there. 
 Total still has its eyes on other targets. It's aggressively developing assets around the world, whether in Angola's deep offshore sites, the Sahara in Libya or the forests of Venezuela. And it has decided that part of its future lies in developing expertise in nuclear energy.
 ''They are very good at capturing deals,'' says J. Robinson West, the chairman of PFC Energy, a consulting firm based in Washington that counts Total as a client. ''They are also prepared to ride through storms where American companies aren't. And they are more commercial and agile than others.''
 NESTLED at the foot of the Pyrenees near the Basque country in southwestern France, the town of Pau is home to Total's global research center and a communication hub linking its global operations. 
 Teams from around the world send core samples from wells -- which the French call ''carottes'' -- for analysis there. Lab workers use magnetic imaging technology, also employed in the medical industry, to look for traces of oil in the samples. 
 The center is home to one of the world's most powerful computers, which can crunch billions of bits of seismic information and provide invaluable clues as to where oil deposits are hidden. Geologists analyzing that data can then consult with drill sites thousands of miles away, using technology that links the research center to platforms around the world. 
 Total spends about $1 billion on research annually to find better ways to discover, squeeze or refine oil and gas. 
 Technological advantages are becoming crucial in the race for petroleum resources. The world's easy oil reserves have mostly been found, forcing companies to drill at ever-greater depths -- sometimes exceeding 30,000 feet -- and to look for hydrocarbons in remote places, like the Arctic. 
 ''I don't think we should be alarmed about reserves' running out,'' says Manoelle Lepoutre, Total's vice president for research and development. ''The potential is there. Engineers know how to extract resources. It's not a question of resources, but more of production capacity.''
 Yet there are increasing limits to oil exploration, which are worrying both engineers and energy experts. At a conference in London two years ago, Mr. de Margerie shook up his colleagues and challenged the industry's consensus when he warned that the world would not be able to pump enough oil to meet energy demands in coming decades.
 At the time, most energy forecasters, including those at the Department of Energy in the United States, expected that supplies would rise above 120 million barrels a day by 2030, up from around 85 million barrels. 
 But in Mr. de Margerie's estimation, world production will struggle to rise to 95 million barrels a day, mostly because of geopolitical constraints but also because oil fields produce less and less as they mature. 
 ''In a wine cellar, you know exactly how much wine you have,'' says Jean-Jacques Mosconi, Total's director of strategy. ''For oil, it's different. You only know your final reserves once you run out.'' 
 More recently, Total has warned that a ''major oil supply crisis'' will emerge if oil prices remain at today's lower levels and companies cut their investments. 
 Of course, Total has long been accustomed to provoking the status quo. After buying Petrofina of Belgium in 1999, Total surprised the French establishment when it started a hostile takeover bid for Elf. Total prevailed after a corporate battle by paying about $50 billion for the company, which was nearly twice its size.
 Overnight, the hard-fought merger propelled Total into the small club of ''super majors,'' pitting it against much larger American corporations. 
 Total recently outplayed its rivals when it grabbed a piece of a huge offshore natural gas field in Russia, beating out Chevron and ConocoPhillips to snare 25 percent of the project. The field, Shtokman, in the Barents Sea, about 350 miles northeast of Murmansk, will cost $20 billion to $25 billion to develop. It is likely to be one of the biggest energy projects of the next decade. 
 While that deal was a success, the company suffered a setback more recently in Saudi Arabia's treacherous Rub al-Khali desert, where the kingdom in 2001 had taken the rare step of allowing foreign investors to look for natural gas. 
 The new policy initially generated great enthusiasm among Total and other foreign oil companies, which saw it as the kingdom's first step toward reopening its oil sector after nationalizing Aramco in the early 1980s. 
 But the excitement quickly waned after the Saudis imposed strict limits on foreign partners, including mandates that all oil discoveries belonged solely to the kingdom and that all gas found there had to be sold on the Saudi market at a cut rate. Total left Rub al-Khali early last year, after its program there ran far over its budget and its teams drilled three wells that came up dry. Shell, another shareholder in the venture, has decided to stick with the project.
 No hard feelings, however. After Total left Rub al-Khali, Aramco renewed its commitment to build a new refinery with the French company in the Red Sea port town of Jubayl, said Michel Benezit, Total's president for refining and marketing. 
 The refinery is expected to be completed by around 2013. 
 IN a conference room at Total's headquarters, Mr. de Margerie lingered with a visitor recently, joking, stretching his schedule after an already long day and straining the nerves of his assistants, who complain that the boss is always late. 
 A few years ago, after arriving nearly two hours late for a meeting with Qatar's oil minister, Abdullah al-Attiyah, Mr. de Margerie fell to one knee to apologize for his tardiness. 
 Such bonhomie has endeared him to colleagues, clients and analysts since his days as Total's chief for the Middle East in the 1990s. But it also made him an unlikely choice to replace Thierry Desmarest as C.E.O. two years ago.
 Mr. Desmarest, who was seen as cold and reserved, is nonetheless widely credited for the success of the merger with Elf, and he remains the company's chairman. 
 Mr. de Margerie is neither an engineer nor a geologist. He joined Total in 1974, just after graduating from the Ecole Superieure de Commerce in Paris, a business school, and picked oil over diplomacy or a career running the family business. His grandfather, Pierre Taittinger, founded the Champagne company that bears his name. Mr. de Margerie's family also once owned the Crillon hotel in Paris and Baccarat, the maker of crystal and jewelry. 
 A gregarious talker with a taste for fine whiskey, Mr. de Margerie can be alternately humorous, rambling or serious and single-minded. He is a bon vivant who enjoys long lunches, preferably with a good bottle of wine and pleasant company. 
 His bushy, starburst mustache, which The Economist magazine once said ''would look right at home on the face of a British cavalry officer,'' earned him the nickname ''Big Mustache'' in the French press. 
 He also used to have a Kazakh Army hat on hand, which he would wear when he wanted to scold his assistants. (''It was a joke,'' he cautions.) 
 Now he keeps nearby a graceful Indonesian figurine from the island of Java to ''keep evil people at bay.'' It was given to him by an employee after he was investigated on suspicion of corruption two years ago. 
 The episode still rankles him. In March 2007, a little more than a month after being named chief executive, he was held in an investigative judge's chambers for nearly 36 hours to answer questions about a 10-year-old gas deal in Iran. The judge ordered that Mr. de Margerie's tie, shoelaces and belt be removed, lest he try to harm himself.
 It was not the first time that he had found himself in such an uncomfortable position. The previous year, he was questioned about his role in the United Nations oil-for-food program in Iraq, which Saddam Hussein used to skim billions of dollars in fees. 
 Total and Mr. de Margerie deny any wrongdoing. No charges have been brought forward, and neither case is part of an active prosecution.
 For his part, Mr. De Margerie says other issues demand his attention.
 At a time when national oil companies -- like Aramco, Petronas in Malaysia, Petrobras in Brazil and Gazprom in Russia -- control large shares of the world's reserves, and nationalistic governments tighten the screws on foreign companies, the traditional role of Western oil companies is under threat. 
 ''Being accepted simply means being able to perform your job even in the most hostile environments,'' Mr. de Margerie says.
 THE Hadhramaut region of central Yemen offers a stunning natural backdrop of deep gorges and lush valleys interlacing one another like delicate fingers. 
 It also provides a good window on how Total balances the requirements of its oil business and its relationship with the locals.
 Total operates its main oil-producing block on a desert plateau about 700 feet above the valley. The company's rigs are practically invisible from below. On the plateau, the scene feels like a lunar landscape. The facility, called Block 10, produces around 50,000 barrels a day, a relatively small operation compared with the huge fields found in neighboring Saudi Arabia. 
 Despite its size, the operation exemplifies the hardships that Total is willing to take on in its hunt for new energy sources. 
 The company, which has been in Yemen since the 1980s, is now the country's largest outside investor. While the government has welcomed foreign concerns, dealings can be complicated. 
 In 2006, a joint venture between the Hunt Oil Company and Exxon ended abruptly after Yemen canceled a contract to explore a field known as Marib al-Jawf. 
 Total's managers here believe that their work with local communities -- building schools or financing computer classes and sewing tutorials -- can help them avoid similar problems. 
 But dealing with local residents can still be tricky. A few months ago, torrential rains devastated the region that lies beneath Total's operations, uprooting nearly half the palm trees in the area and killing 44 people. The company says it has provided more than $300,000 in emergency aid to help deal with the flooding, in addition to $800,000 it spends each year for its own local development programs. 
 On a recent morning, Mr. Deffontaines, Total's general manager in Yemen, was meeting with residents hit by the floods. Sitting among tribal representatives, Mr. Deffontaines grew uncomfortable as Dr. Awad al-Jabery, a local politician, asked Total for more money for reconstruction in the region. 
 ''We are like kids demanding things from their father,'' Dr. al-Jabery said. ''Oil will one day be depleted in this area for Total, but if you contribute to this project, you will be remembered here for centuries.''
 Mr. Deffontaines defused the tension with a broad smile and a quick joke. 
 ''I prefer to keep a brotherly relationship with you rather than one of father and son,'' he said. 
 So it goes for Mr. Deffontaines, who says he spends about a third of his time on community-related issues in Yemen -- in addition to attending to such matters as the explosive charge placed on his pipeline by terrorists last year that punched a fist-size hole in the tube.
 More recently, he has had to contend with thorny personnel issues. In April, in response to growing security concerns, he decided to send the families of his workers back to France. His own wife, son and twin daughters were among those forced to depart. 
 Mr. Deffontaines says that sending loved ones home was among the hardest choices he's had to make, but it may have been very wise. A few months later, militants disguised as soldiers detonated two car bombs outside the American Embassy compound here. 
 While Mr. Deffontaines chalks up all of this to the ups and downs -- and the thrills -- of working for Total, he says his family is less enamored of the hardships.
 ''My wife's not too thrilled,'' he says. ''You could say she doesn't fill up at Total these days.''

HEADLINE: Yes, Hollywood, She's Back, Maybe

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SCHOENEMAN

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
 IT was almost midnight on a recent Saturday when Cher walked into h.wood, a three-month-old club at the end of a driveway in a mall that includes the Kodak Theater, home to the Academy Awards ceremony. She wore jeans and a plaid button-down shirt, blending in with the crowd. As she navigated her way to the dance floor, patrons whipped their heads around, whispering her name until the buzz rivaled the bass. 
 Cher was swooping in upon the recommendation of her old friend Amanda Scheer Demme, h.wood's designer and a part owner. But Ms. Demme was not in there that evening, even if her hand was evident in many of the details, both large and small, that gave the club its atmosphere. 
 ''I'm not trying to be the queen of the night life,'' Ms. Demme said later. Three years ago, she was.
 Ms. Demme ran Teddy's and Tropicana in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, where most every night the hopefuls lined up on Hollywood Boulevard, vying for a chance to dance on banquettes with Paris and Nicole, Leo and Tobey, Mary-Kate and Ashley.
 That gig ended in 2007, after Ms. Demme's clashes with hotel management over lawsuits, noise complaints and liquor license issues. (Courtney Love was once carried out on a stretcher).
 This bar marks Ms. Demme's comeback. She joined the entrepreneur John Terzian and the night life veteran Loyal Pennings to transform a former Burger King into a dark, sexy labyrinth.
 ''I wanted it to be some place that people discover and find something they love, and are not force fed,'' Ms. Demme said. But while the club is attracting crowds, behind the scenes it has experienced birthing pains.
 Some believe Ms. Demme's comeback is already in peril. Some antique furniture borrowed before the opening has been returned because the club couldn't pay for it, according to people directly involved in the discussions between the club and the dealers. Rumors that the famously intense and demanding Ms. Demme is out -- and that the locks were changed to keep her out -- have been constant, prompting a response from Mr. Terzian.
 ''We are not firing her,'' he said, ''but she did take a step back.''
 Mr. Terzian defended Ms. Demme, suggesting that others might want to see her fail. ''Amanda is not a well-liked person around town,'' he said. ''Everyone knows that.'' 
 Mr. Terzian said the locks had indeed been changed, but to protect the merchandise of the attached clothing boutique. He said Ms. Demme's step back was part of the original plan.
 For her part, Ms. Demme said: ''I'm trying to give versus take. I'm not perfect in any way, but I want to be a better person, always.''
 Rocky beginnings are nothing new for nightclubs. But all the signs looked good when h.wood opened. Ms. Demme's fans discovered it right away. By mid-January, the club seemed destined to evolve quickly into a full-blown hot spot, drawing names like Vince Vaughn, Drew Barrymore and Jake Gyllenhaal.
 ''It feels like Alice in Wonderland painted black,'' said Chris Holmes, a record producer who occasionally D.J.'s on Saturday nights at h.wood. ''It's beautiful, like a Paris opium den.''
 But beauty doesn't come cheap. Joel Chen and Adam Blackman, prominent vintage and antique furniture dealers, were among more than a dozen vendors who lent high-end furniture to Ms. Demme and Cliff Fong, a Los Angeles interior decorator working on h.wood, according to people directly involved in the discussions.
 Mr. Chen gave the h.wood team the option to see how the furniture worked out, without even swiping a credit card. Mr. Chen has since removed some of his pieces and replaced others with cheaper models, those involved in the discussion said.
 Mina de Gifis, the owner of Zoo, a store in the Pasadena Antiques Center, said she lent h.wood $6,495 worth of 1969 Woodard furniture and cushions in October. The club didn't pay and later returned the furniture, minus the cushions, which had been thrown out, she said.
 Ms. de Gifis is filing a lawsuit against the club's owners.
 Mr. Terzian confirmed that there were problems with several furniture vendors.
 ''There were a lot of things that were on consignment and a lot of things that had to go back,'' he said. ''I wasn't involved in the initial part of that, but I was left holding the bag, with millions of things. There are some vendors that are understandably upset because it has taken a while on payment plans but all is being handled.''
 He insisted that none of this was Ms. Demme's fault. ''Amanda has never had anything to do with the financial side,'' he said.
 The bar is still drawing crowds and celebrities -- although on Oscar night, because of security, it will be closed. 
 At this multileveled space, forget Cosmos -- that would be way too boom era. Downstairs, the bartenders just serve standard drinks ranging from $12 to $16.
 ''The economy makes it a whole different game out there,'' said Ms. Demme, who often wears her ''Great Depression look'' -- gray men's pants, a vest and suspenders -- on the rare nights she appears. ''I don't know how much people are going to spend at night to go out.''

HEADLINE: 'I was determined to send out a clear message of change.' GIORGIO ARMANI

BYLINE: By ALIX BROWNE

 BODY:
 President Obama has yet to announce the appointment of a chairman of the Council of Fashion Advisers, but it seems that Giorgio Armani is already positioning himself for the post. The designer, who announced his company's plans to invest upward of $100 million to bolster his wholesale and retail presence in the United States back in 2007 -- and who was spotted backstage at his recent men's-wear show in Milan sporting a Shepard Fairey Obama button -- has not lost faith in the American consumer. The cornerstone of that faith is his newly opened 43,000-square-foot Fifth Avenue megastore, a veritable temple to the Italian brand in all its incarnations. 
''I was determined to send out a clear message of change,'' Armani explains of the store's multilabel concept, ''interpreting the current trend for mixing genres and juxtaposing items in different price brackets.'' A design collaboration between Armani and the architects Doriana and Massimiliano Fuksas (who have also created high-profile Armani showcases in Hong Kong and Tokyo), the New York store reflects not just the way that people shop in the 21st century (''We wear tailoring and jeans, after all, on different occasions,'' Armani points out) but also the tenets of upward mobility. The space is anchored by a massive spiral staircase that wends its way through the various selling floors from Armani Jeans, on the basement level, to cosmetics on the first and culminating with the designer's secondary label, Emporio Armani, and collection lines one floor up. (A third floor houses a restaurant.) ''Freedom of expression is the main value I would like the store to convey,'' Armani insists. ''A prestigious shopping destination, of course,'' he adds, ''but one that is less exclusive in character than comparable addresses, with a democratic mood, which I am certain represents the future and is also, historically, a distinctly American ideal.'' In other words, if the American economy is going to pick itself up again, then let it be by Armani bootstraps. Says the designer, ''It is an exciting departure, and the results of the other stores like Milan and Ginza give me hope.''

HEADLINE: Father in Chief

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN. 
Lisa Belkin is a contributing writer and author of the Motherlode blog.

 BODY:
Ours is a generation of parents obsessed with parenting -- devouring books about it, blogging about it, turning it into a competitive sport. So it's not surprising that President Obama's time in the White House looks like some kind of public experiment in child-rearing. We are intrigued by the first family not only because their children are adorable and so excited about getting a puppy and meeting the Jonas Brothers but also because our president seems to be such a good father -- loving but not a pushover, thrilled that he now has a job where he can be with the girls for breakfast and dinner, strict about their chores, slightly cranky when their school is canceled ''because of what? Some ice?''
 He seems like such a good father, in fact, that many of us began expecting him to be our parent, too. What is good governing if not good parenting -- what with providing a moral compass, negotiating bickering between red and blue siblings and making sure the spinach gets eaten before we indulge in dessert? 
 In the first weeks, those in parenting circles were downright exuberant about what a better parent to the country this one was than the last. ''A good parent doesn't try to be their child's friend,'' says Dr. Hannah Solky, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Rochester School of Medicine. ''A good parent says, It is time to put away 'childish things,' or, It's time to 'pick ourselves up' and 'dust ourselves off,' instead of handing you the credit card and telling you to go shopping.''
 Those around the new president have found themselves describing him as dad in chief, too. In explaining why Obama was no longer demanding that those free-spending A.I.G. executives be fired, as he had during the campaign, the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said the president's tack was more ''like that disappointed parent that doesn't embarrass you in the mall, but you feel like you've let somebody down.''
 There are big differences, of course, between parenting and governing. Unlike children, we choose our leaders; the job of those leaders is not to nurture us emotionally; and the fantasy of a wise, all-powerful Daddy is what has gotten Russia and Germany in trouble over the years. But if Obama is going to struggle in his metaphorical role as parent to the country, it will be less because of the differences between parenting and leadership and more because of the similarities.
 Like governing, parenting is messy. There are dictums that everyone agrees on, advice books are filled with them, but more often than not your child, your particular dilemma, does not hew to the books.
 A parent -- and a leader -- we all know, should tell the truth. Trying to shield children from reality rarely works and only leads to distrust, the experts say. ''It's not good parenting when you say to your kids, 'The house is not on fire,' '' Harold S. Koplewicz, the director of the N.Y.U. Child Study Center, says. 
 There are exceptions to the truth-telling rule, of course -- no parent is really going to tell a child everything, and there are some things we may want a president to keep close to the chest. But putting those aside leaves us with the more subtle question of how to phrase the truth. While pushing his stimulus plan earlier this month, Obama said the action was needed to keep a ''crisis'' from spiraling into a ''catastrophe.'' A jarring word. At his first press conference he was asked whether he risks ''taking down the economy'' with too much emphasis on the scary side. Truth is good, unless what is needed at a particular moment is a strong, steady, omnipotent parent who keeps the kids calm. Can one parent do both at the same time? 
 Equally murky is the idea -- great in theory -- that a good parent listens, asks questions, hears all points of view and then decides. Obama listened. He called it bipartisanship. He patiently heard out Representative Eric Cantor three days after taking office, when the two argued over tax policy toward low-wage workers. Then, according to Rahm Emanuel, he said, half in jest, ''we just have a difference here, and I'm president.''
 But all that talking and listening doesn't necessarily get you anywhere in a house full of teenagers -- or in a House full of representatives. And the lesson here might be that Cantor wound up taking the car without Dad's permission anyway, when not a single House Republican voted Obama's way.
 Finally there is the rule that ''a good parent admits mistakes.'' Says Gail Saltz, an associate professor of psychiatry at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, ''Parents enhance their credibility when they can say, 'I think I screwed up here.' '' And yet, doesn't the message at some point become ''I am not up to this task?''
 When one cabinet nominee after another faced tax questions a few weeks ago, Obama invited a parade of network anchors into the Oval Office and took the blame: ''Did I screw up in this situation?'' he said to Brian Williams. ''Absolutely.'' It was both a refreshing bit of candor and more than a little discomforting. Maybe we want to know Dad can be fallible, except when he actually is. Then we avert our eyes.
 Some of the discomfort comes from watching the familiar. What Obama is playing out on the national stage is what we are doing too, in our own homes. Starting with the rules, then finessing them. Misjudging and misstepping, then starting again. There is strange comfort in knowing that our parents did much of it wrong, too -- and a cause for concern in the fact that there isn't a therapist's couch large enough for 300 million of us.

 BODY:
A FREE LIFE, by Ha Jin. (Vintage International, $15.95.) Jin's previous novels, one of which, ''Waiting,'' won a National Book Award in 1999, have all been set abroad. This one is about Chinese immigrants to the United States, who through trial and error, bank deposit by bank deposit, become Americans. Jin describes their two-steps-forward, one-step-back progression in simple sentences full of domestic details. ''Life, from day to day, seems hardly to alter, yet it shifts beyond recognition over the years,'' our reviewer, Walter Kirn, wrote. ''This is what fascinates Jin.'' 
 PICTURES AT A REVOLUTION: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood, by Mark Harris. (Penguin, $17.) This book tracks from conception to release the five films nominated for the Academy Award for best picture of 1967 -- ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' ''The Graduate,'' ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' ''In the Heat of the Night'' and ''Doctor Dolittle.'' This happy strategy both illuminates an industry on the brink of change and provides, as Harris puts it, a ''collage of the American psyche.'' He also reveals tidbits like the early choices to play Mr. and Mrs. Robinson -- Doris Day and Ronald Reagan. What would Harris make of the movies being honored tonight? (P.S. The Oscar went to ''In the Heat of the Night.'') 
 FREE LUNCH: How the Wealthiest Americans Enrich Themselves at Government Expense (and Stick You With the Bill), by David Cay Johnston. (Portfolio, $16.) ''We have gone astray,'' Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning former reporter for The New York Times, writes. He denounces government tax subsidies and the ''rules that make it easy to rig markets, break unions and short-change workers,'' helping the rich get richer at the expense of everyone else. ''If there is any silver lining'' to the economic crisis, Steven Greenhouse, a labor and workplace correspondent for The Times, says, it is that the nation has finally begun ''paying attention to just how bad things are for millions of workers.'' Even during the boom years of 2000 to 2007, Greenhouse says in THE BIG SQUEEZE: Tough Times for the American Worker (Anchor, $14.95), the median income for working-class American households fell by nearly 4 percent, as workers were faced with falling wages, the loss of manufacturing jobs and inadequate health insurance. 
 RESISTANCE, by Owen Sheers. (Anchor, $14.95.) In a remote Welsh valley in the fall of 1944, after the failure of the D-Day invasion and the German occupation of the southern half of Britain, a gentlemanly German officer takes up with a farm woman whose husband has left to join the resistance. In a novel that resembles Philip Roth's ''Plot Against America,'' Sheers evokes the pull of the ''everyday rituals of rural life'' in the Welsh countryside against the ''abstraction of national unity,'' Jess Row wrote in the Book Review. War is also at the heart of WHERE HAVE ALL THE SOLDIERS GONE? The Transformation of Modern Europe by James J. Sheehan (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $15.95). Sheehan's subject is the demilitarization of Europe since 1945, but two-thirds of the narrative deals with the ''magnitude and variety of the suffering'' of the war years. 
 THE SOUL THIEF, by Charles Baxter. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.95.) Identity is the theme of Baxter's novel, as his protagonist, a graduate student in upstate New York, becomes the obsession of a fellow student, who steals his clothes and appropriates his life story. 
 COMEBACK: Conservatism That Can Win Again, by David Frum. (Broadway, $14.95.) ''Voters want solutions to the problems of today,'' Frum, a former Bush speechwriter, warns. ''Those are the solutions that today's conservatives have to invent.'' For starters, Frum proposes managing government well, moving beyond tax cuts as the universal solution, imposing a tax on carbon emissions, and accepting Roe v. Wade and gay marriage. ''In our nostalgia for the country that used to be,'' Frum writes in an afterword, ''we are ceasing to be competitive in the country that will be.'' 
 THE FOLDED WORLD, by Amity Gaige. (Random House, $14.) A young couple's marriage is threatened when the husband, a social worker, becomes overinvolved with a disturbed client in this well-written novel, Gaige's second. 
 REVOLUTION IN MIND: The Creation of Psychoanalysis, by George Makari. (Harper Perennial, $18.99.) This ''lucid history of the rise of psychoanalysis'' as George Prochnik described it in the Book Review, argues for the cultural reach of psychoanalysis and dismisses stale quarrels about Freud. ''Makari maps out the Freud family tree with all its thorny branches, its disciples and dissenters,'' Prochnik wrote, and ''projects a pleasing orderliness onto a tangled tale.'' 
 THE SUM OF OUR DAYS, by Isabel Allende. Translated by Margaret Sayers Peden. (Harper Perennial, $14.99.) Allende's memoir takes the form of a letter to her daughter, Paula, who died in 1992 at the age of 29. Allende recounts what happened after Paula's death -- her travels, her relationships with her son and her second husband, her eventual return to writing.

HEADLINE: The Anti-Bono

BYLINE: Interview by DEBORAH SOLOMON

 BODY:
Q: As a native of Zambia with advanced degrees in public policy and economics from Harvard and Oxford, you are about to publish an attack on Western aid to Africa and its recent glamorization by celebrities. ''Dead Aid,'' as your book is called, is particularly hard on rock stars. Have you met Bono? I have, yes, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last year. It was at a party to raise money for Africans, and there were no Africans in the room, except for me. 
 What do you think of him? I'll make a general comment about this whole dependence on ''celebrities.'' I object to this situation as it is right now where they have inadvertently or manipulatively become the spokespeople for the African continent. 
 You argue in your book that Western aid to Africa has not only perpetuated poverty but also worsened it, and you are perhaps the first African to request in book form that all development aid be halted within five years. Think about it this way -- China has 1.3 billion people, only 300 million of whom live like us, if you will, with Western living standards. There are a billion Chinese who are living in substandard conditions. Do you know anybody who feels sorry for China? Nobody. 
 Maybe that's because they have so much money that we here in the U.S. are begging the Chinese for loans. Forty years ago, China was poorer than many African countries. Yes, they have money today, but where did that money come from? They built that, they worked very hard to create a situation where they are not dependent on aid. 
 What do you think has held back Africans? I believe it's largely aid. You get the corruption -- historically, leaders have stolen the money without penalty -- and you get the dependency, which kills entrepreneurship. You also disenfranchise African citizens, because the government is beholden to foreign donors and not accountable to its people. 
 If people want to help out, what do you think they should do with their money if not make donations? Microfinance. Give people jobs. 
 But what if you just want to donate, say, $25? Go to the Internet and type in Kiva.org, where you can make a loan to an African entrepreneur. 
 Do you have a financial interest in Kiva? No, except that I've made loans through the system. I don't own a share of Kiva. 
 You just left your longtime job as a banker for Goldman Sachs in London, where you live. What did you do there, exactly? I worked in the capital markets, helping mostly emerging countries to issue bonds. That's why I know that that works. 
 Which countries sought your help? Israel, Turkey and South Africa, primarily. 
 Why didn't you get a bond issue going in your native Zambia or other African countries? Many politicians seem to have a lazy muscle. Issuing a bond would require that the president and the cabinet ministers go out and market their country. Why would they do that when they can just call up the World Bank and say, ''Can I please have some money?''
 I keep reading about a new crop of African presidents who are supposedly free-market guys, including Rupiah Banda, the president of Zambia. There are lots who are nominally free market, but they haven't been aggressive about implementing those policies. 
 What do your parents do? My mother is chairman of a bank called the Indo-Zambia Bank. It's a joint venture between Zambia and India. My father runs Integrity Foundation, an anticorruption organization. 
 For all your belief in the potential of capitalism, the free market is now in free fall and everyone is questioning the supposed wonders of the unregulated market. I wish we questioned the aid model as much as we are questioning the capitalism model. Sometimes the most generous thing you can do is just say no.

HEADLINE: Clinton Paints China Policy With a New Green Hue

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Declaring that ''we hope you won't make the same mistakes we made,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton invited China to join the United States in an ambitious effort to curb greenhouse gases, as she toured an energy-efficient power plant in Beijing on Saturday.
 ''When we were industrializing and growing, we didn't know any better; neither did Europe,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''Now we're smart enough to figure out how to have the right kind of growth.'' 
 The gas-fired power plant, which uses sophisticated turbines made by General Electric, is nearly twice as efficient as the coal-fired plants that supply much of China's electricity and that helped vault China past the United States as the world's leading emitter of carbon dioxide.
 The Obama administration hopes to make climate change the centerpiece of a broader, more vigorous engagement with China. For Mrs. Clinton, the two-day stop in Beijing at the end of a weeklong Asian tour, represents an effort to put her own stamp on a relationship that was dominated by the Treasury Department in the latter years of the Bush administration.
 ''The opportunities for us to work together are unmatched anywhere in the world,'' Mrs. Clinton declared, on a hectic day filled with meetings with President Hu Jintao and other top Chinese officials.
 Human rights groups have criticized Mrs. Clinton for soft-pedaling Tibet and other issues during her first visit as secretary of state. She said she did not want these disputes to interfere with critical challenges like climate change, the global economic crisis and security concerns.
 It was a stark contrast to 1995, when Mrs. Clinton, then first lady, gave a speech in Beijing at a United Nations conference, in which she catalogued abuses against women and concluded by saying that ''human rights are women's rights, and women's rights are human rights.''
 Speaking after a meeting with the foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, Mrs. Clinton said she had raised the Tibet issue and other concerns. But she argued that the work of advocacy groups and people in civil society in this area was ''at least as important'' as that of government officials.
 Mr. Yang repeated China's customary statement that Beijing was ready to discuss human rights with Washington on the basis of ''equality and noninterference in each other's affairs.'' The ''smiling faces'' on Chinese people, he said, attested to the country's respect for human rights.
 A local rights group, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said the Beijing police put a number of dissidents and activists under surveillance during Mrs. Clinton's visit, confining some in their homes.
 On the global economic crisis, the two governments said they would work together to chart a recovery. Mrs. Clinton said she expected to see changes in the economic relationship between China, with its high savings rate, and the United States, with its heavy borrowing.
 During their meeting, she said, Mr. Yang told her that Chinese people were spending more on home appliances. ''It would also be fair to say that that many Americans have now come to terms with the fact that saving might be a good habit to acquire,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
 She thanked Mr. Yang for China's ''continuing confidence'' in the United States, as the largest foreign buyer of Treasury securities. He offered a noncommittal statement that China would decide where to invest its foreign-exchange reserves on the basis of safety, value and liquidity.
 Mrs. Clinton got a warmer reception at lunch with Dai Bingguo, a member of the powerful State Council. ''You look younger and more beautiful than you look on TV,'' he exclaimed. Mrs. Clinton was momentarily nonplused, before replying, ''Well, we will get along very well.''
 Mrs. Clinton's visit to the Taiyanggong Thermal Power Plant allowed her to steer the focus back to climate change. She introduced her special envoy for climate change, Todd Stern, who noted that the United States and China accounted for 40 percent of the world's emissions.
 ''This not a matter of politics or morality or right or wrong,'' he said. ''It is simply the unforgiving math of accumulating emissions.''
 So far, the United States and China are mainly collaborating on research projects and ventures like the power plant. The harder work, analysts said, will come if the United States presses China to accept mandatory caps on its emissions -- something Beijing has so far rejected.
 Still, some China experts say they believe that climate change can give relations between the countries fresh energy. The White House has paid close attention to a report by the Asia Society and the Pew Center for Global Climate Change, which offers a road map for cooperation.
 ''If you look at U.S.-China relations, there are a lot of issues that can go either way,'' said Orville Schell, a China scholar at the Asia Society who was involved in producing the report. ''What's missing is an issue in which the two countries can lean into a problem together.''

HEADLINE: With Attendance Off, Disney Is Dealing

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
IF you've long put off your kids' entreaties to take them on a Disney vacation because of an aversion to long lines, high prices and throngs of mouse-eared fans, you may soon be running out of excuses. 
 Attendance at Disney's theme parks in the United States began to slip in the last part of 2008, dropping about 5 percent compared with a year earlier. To keep guests coming through the turnstiles in 2009, the company is rolling out deals not seen in years. 
 In Florida, the Walt Disney World Resort is offering a seven-night vacation package at one of its 23 on-site hotels for the price of four, including admission to the park itself. That means a family of four could stay at a Disney-value resort like the Pop Century Resort for $1,375 in late April -- a savings of $416. While there are a few blackout dates, the bargain has recently been extended for travel through Aug. 15. Guests who book the deal for travel in early or late March also receive a $200 gift card for Disney merchandise or dining. 
 In California, Disneyland is offering multiple vacation packages from two-night stays that include gift cards and adult tickets at the children's price to a children-fly-free deal through Alaska Airlines. Both Disneyland and Disney World are offering free admission to active or retired United States military personnel and to people who visit on their birthdays this year. 
 Not to be out-done, some of Disney's main competitors have introduced packages to lure visitors. This month, Universal Orlando Resort extended its five-nights-for-the-price-of-three offer to families that book by March 29 and stay by Oct. 8. Packages begin at $689 for a family of four, including accommodations and park admission. Families that book a four-night package, starting at $789, get three nights free. And if you stay in one of Universal's three on-site hotels, the Royal Pacific, the Hard Rock or the Loews Portofino Bay, for $1,144 and up with the package, you get front-of-the-line access to all Universal Orlando attractions.
 Worlds of Discovery, the theme park group that includes SeaWorld and Busch Gardens, has joined with nearly 20 hotels in Orlando to offer a buy-three-nights-get-two-free package that includes admission to any two of three parks -- SeaWorld, Busch Gardens or Aquatica, SeaWorld's new water park. Packages, offered only online at www.seaworldvacations.com, start at $561 for a family of four and must be bought by March 1 for travel by June 26. Separately, SeaWorld, Busch Gardens and Aquatica are offering adult tickets, normally $74.95 each, at the child price ($64.95) when purchased at least a week in advance through the park Web sites (www.worldsofdiscovery.com). Even Discovery Cove, where guests pay $239 a person to swim with dolphins, is offering $50 off reservations when guests book and visit by March 31. 
 The bargains mean more options for families on tight vacation budgets, even in peak travel periods. ''It would be crazy to spend full price to go to Disney right now,'' said Mary Waring, founder of MouseSavers.com, which offers insider advice on ways to save money on a Disney vacation. Until recently, she said, Disney World had ''been trying to push the upper limit'' on pricing with annual admission rate increases and popular hotels' charging upward of $399 for standard rooms. 
 But this year, with the seven-nights-for-four package, a family of four can stay at even the most upscale Disney hotels -- the deluxe villa resorts -- for just $2,611 in March or roughly $373 a night, including admission tickets. 
 Farther-flung hotels are offering some of the cheapest rates. A recent search on Expedia.com, which maps out hotels near Orlando theme parks by region, showed average rates at three-star properties in the first week of March as low as $56 a night in the Maingate West area, which lies west of Interstate 4 and directly south of Disney's Wide World of Sports area, and $84 a night in Downtown Disney. But with Disney offering such compelling deals, Ms. Waring said, ''people are thinking 'if I can stay at Disney, why not?' '' 
 Walt Disney World Resort owns and operates 23 hotels ranging from motel-style accommodations to an upscale hotel with views of the Cinderella Castle and a full-service spa. The main benefit of staying at one of these places is convenient transportation to the parks, via buses, monorails or boats. Though there are other perks like airport transfers that eliminate the need for a rental car for families who plan to only visit Disney World parks. And each day, one Disney theme park opens one hour early for resort guests and stays open three hours after the posted park close.
 There are only a few options, however, for a family of five or more looking for suite-style accommodations with a kitchenette and separate living room at a hotel owned and operated by Disney. As an alternative, there are several Marriott hotels in the area with suites that are offering a fourth-night-free deal, with rates from $89 a night at the Fairfield Inn & Suites. MouseSavers.com offers special negotiated rates as low as $199 a night for a two-bedroom villa that can sleep up to eight people at the Caribe Royal Orlando in May and $89 a night at its sister property, Buena Vista Suites, for a one-bedroom suite that sleeps six, including breakfast. 
 Sites like Homeaway.com and Zonder.com, also offer rentals near Disney from $623 to $1,117 a week for a family of eight.
 But you don't have to go far to find more affordable amusement park options this year. Regional parks, which rely heavily on drive-to traffic, including Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, and Six Flags with 20 parks across the United States, Mexico and Canada, have frozen admission rates. This summer, Cedar Point will offer one-day adult tickets for $43.99, the same price as at the end of last season, and roughly $1 less than in 2005. Admission varies by location for the Six Flags theme parks, but can be as low as $39.99 per adult at Six Flags Over Georgia in Atlanta. Season passes, perhaps the best value for repeat visitors, have been discounted to $49.99 at three parks: Six Flags Over Georgia; Six Flags Great America, near Chicago; and Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, near San Francisco. 
 ''We recognize families are watching their budget more than ever before,'' said Sandra Daniels, a spokeswoman for Six Flags, ''We want to be an economical value.''

HEADLINE: An Interview With Ma Ying-jeou

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of an interview with President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan, on Feb. 12, supplied by the Government Information Office of Taiwan. Keith Bradsher, of The New York Times, and Jeanne Moore, of The International Herald Tribune, conducted the interview.
 Keith Bradsher: What would you like for Secretary Clinton to be saying to the Chinese leadership during her visit to Beijing regarding cross-strait relations?
President Ma Ying-jeou: I hope the American government and the secretary of state to encourage what my government has been doing with the mainland. For example, we have improved economic relations with the mainland in which we hope to comprehensively normalize our economic relationship. On the other hand, we have also reduced tensions in the Taiwan Strait; I think the U.S. can play a constructive role in encouraging the status quo.
 Mr. Bradsher: As the Mrs. Clinton team prepares for this trip, they have been talking about energy, climate change, North Korea, Mideast policy; Taiwan has not been visible in their preparations. Are you concerned that this team will not be as focused on Taiwan-China relations? 
 President Ma: It's quite clear that the situation across the Taiwan Strait is very different from what it was a couple years ago. Ever since we came to power we have effectively reduced tensions across the Taiwan Strait so that Taiwan is no longer a problem in relations between the United States and Beijing. I think this is good news for everyone. We're not dissatisfied with the fact that they didn't mention Taiwan. Many of our American friends advise us that ''no news is good news.'' 
 As we improve our relations with the mainland we also are restoring the mutual trust between Taiwan and the U.S., which was largely lost in the last eight years. This is very important for Taiwan because after all we have had a long security relationship with the U.S. Last October the Bush administration notified Congress about our request for defensive weaponry. That was also very important to us. On the one hand, we want to have peace with the mainland, but on the other hand, we also need to maintain our defense to achieve that purpose. 
 Mr Bradsher: Secretary Clinton has signaled that she wants the U.S.-Chinese relationship to be broader than the focus exclusively on economic issues. Is that good for Taiwan to have a broader engagement or is it good for Taiwan that, given the current global economic troubles, for the relationship to be focused on economics?
 President Ma: In our strategic point of view, the U.S. having a broader relationship with the mainland is not against our interests at all. Some of these issues concern us as well: antiterrorism, energy, sustainable environment, and so on. 
 Jeanne Moore: She also mentioned human rights.
 President Ma: Yes. This government is taking steps to ratify the two international covenants for human rights adopted by the U.N. back in 1966. We signed them in 1967 but didn't have the chance to ratify them because we lost our representation in the U.N. in 1971. Forty years later we decided to ratify these two covenants to enhance the human rights standards in Taiwan. We hope we will complete the process this year. Mainland China has ratified and signed the social, economic and cultural rights covenant, but for the civil and political right covenant they signed it but did not ratify it. So it would be interesting to see how human rights protection, freedom and democracy can be enhanced in different parts across the Taiwan Strait. 
 Mr. Bradsher: Has the coincidence of the financial tsunami with closer relations with the mainland made it harder to persuade the people of Taiwan that closer cross-straits relations are beneficial for the Taiwan economy?
 President Ma:No, it has not made it harder. Improvement of relations with the mainland has brought to Taiwan very tangible benefits: cost reductions, time savings, freer movement of people, goods, services, capital and information, lower political risks, better investment environment. With or without the financial tsunami we want to adopt right policies because the ultimate goal for our economic development for the current period is to first transform Taiwan into the innovation center of the world, second, the trade and investment hub in the Asia-Pacific, third, the headquarters for Taiwanese enterprises and Asia-Pacific headquarters of multinational firms. Therefore, the measures we have undertaken in regards to cross-strait relations have already made these three goals easier to achieve. 
 Also, our cross-strait policy has become our most popular-approved policy ever since we came to power. I can provide you with some of the opinion polls after the visit of Mr. Chen Yunlin -- chairman of Mainland China's Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait -- which would show the basic opinions of the people all around Taiwan. For farmers including fish farmers in the south, they are able to export their products to the mainland through seaports in the south, thus saving a lot of time. For example, fruit shipping used to take eight days because they had to go through Hong Kong, but now it takes less than four days. Farmers therefore don't have to pick their fruits prematurely, and the fruits can also have a longer shelf life after they arrive on the mainland. So, these developments are basically welcomed in Taiwan. 
 Ms. Moore: I wonder if they are just as welcomed in Hong Kong?
 President Ma: As far as the charter flights are concerned, right now there are only 108 flights per week. This accounts for only one-fifth of the total demand. In other words, most of the travel still goes through Hong Kong. That is why we have continuously asked the mainland to expand the current services, which probably will be done in a month or two. We hope before the middle of the year we can change the current charter flights to scheduled flights, which would improve cross-strait business because people would have more fixed travel schedules for them to choose from. 
 Mr. Bradsher: That said, we are looking at 500-600 tourists a day coming from the mainland; the ceiling had been 3000. Are you disappointed?
 President Ma: Yes, but the mainland has promised to allow more tourists to come to Taiwan and to allow more travel agencies to organize those tours. We have made serious complaints to the mainland side. The mainland was afraid that if they allow too many tourists to come to Taiwan, the tourists may not be in groove with Taiwan society. But that never happened; in the last seven months mainland tourists have been well accepted here, with very few incidences of trouble. So I think the mainland feels that it's also time to allow more tourists to come. We are also making it easier for them to come. The length of stay has been extended from 10 to 15 days. Mainland tourists need to come in groups, and we have reduced the group size from 10 to 5. We expect to see a surge of mainland tourists beginning in March. 
 Keith Bradsher: How high will unemployment go in this downturn?
 President Ma: I think our situation is similar to Singapore. Since 70 percent of our GDP is dependent on exports, we're badly hit. On the one hand we will try to stimulate more exports; we have a special plan to achieve that goal. On the other hand, the emphasis has been shifted to the expansion of domestic demand. So we are heavily investing in infrastructure. Starting this year we will be investing more than $10 billion, hoping to create more jobs and build up our infrastructure so that in an economic upturn we will be ready to take full advantage of it. In the next couple of months we will be undertaking many measures to help provide jobs for our people. We dispensed shopping vouchers to stimulate consumption. Because we have a very high savings rate (about 29 percent), 9 percent of which is surplus savings rate, which could be used for consumption. The shopping vouchers helped to keep almost 50,000 jobs, especially in the service industries. Judging from what this measure has achieved in the last couple of weeks, we know that by and large small shops saw a surge of sales of about 20 to 30 percent. Everywhere I went I was asked to do it again. 
 Mr. Bradsher: Will you?
 President Ma: We haven't done the evaluation yet. We will do the evaluation later in May or June to see how much the shopping vouchers have contributed to our GDP growth. It was first estimated at 0.64 percent, but some people now say it could be 1 percent. We will see.
 Mr. Bradsher: Some people said that you would do it again if it was 1 percent or more?
 President Ma: We don't know yet. Shopping voucher is but one part of the measures to rescue the economy. A lot more depends on the infrastructure projects. Infrastructure investment is the main thrust of our economic stimulus package. 
 Mr. Bradsher: At an unemployment center I was talking to a woman who is unemployed, 57. She said that she was worried about her unemployment benefits running out. I know there's talk to extend it for those over the age of 45. How much of a problem does Taiwan face for lower-income and older workers, for whom this may be their last years in the workforce, in this economic downturn?
 President Ma: Middle-aged people usually face a more difficult time, so this age group is also one of the target groups of our rescue effort. In a few months we will announce plans to help people to land on temporary jobs and if possible on relatively long-term jobs. This is the right time to really get fiscal. The greatest fear for our people is losing jobs. The government will certainly coordinate our efforts in creating jobs. Actually, on the first day of the New Year holiday our economic and financial ministers met here to work out plans to create more jobs. We met again on the ninth day of the holiday to finalize the plans. Although we can't solve the problem right away, we still hope we can keep the unemployment rate under 4.5 percent. 
 Mr. Bradsher: It's now 5 percent?
 President Ma: Yes. I admit this is a very ambitious plan. In the past, we once had an unemployment rate more than 5 percent in 2001-2002. Gradually it went down to 3.9 percent as of early last year. But it went up again.
 Mr. Bradsher: Whose fault is the economic crisis in Taiwan now?
 President Ma: Taiwan heavily depends on exports, and a high percentage of our exports went to the U.S., Europe and mainland China. In the mainland our exports received value-added changes and then re-exported to other markets. Therefore, the U.S. was the largest export market for us if you combine our direct export to the U.S. and our re-export to the U.S. via mainland. When U.S. market is down, we are down. But I think we have made the right decisions in so far as the rescue plan is concerned. In less than three weeks after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in mid-September, my government announced that it would guarantee all bank deposits in early October. We were the first country to do that in Asia. The effect was magical; in three months the deposits of medium-sized banks increased by roughly $7 billion. In the first month we observed nearly $13 billion flowing back to those banks. They had lost their deposits to large banks with government stake because people had more confidence in government banks. But this measure changed everything. So the liquidity problem and other related problems had been largely taken care of. The financial industry so far is in good shape. We had some problems with our insurance companies, but in general our financial industry is OK. Now, our primary task is creating more jobs for people who have were laid off as a result of the financial tsunami.
 Mr. Bradsher: Is positive economic growth this year still possible in Taiwan?
 President Ma: It depends on the recovery of our major export markets. Last year the government estimated this year's growth rate to be 2 to 2.5 percent, but most financial institutions around the world gave more pessimistic forecasts. Therefore, we have to work very hard to maintain positive growth. 
 Mr. Bradsher: Will it be -11 percent?
 President Ma: The government thinks that is a little too extreme, but we know the situation is severe, and we are working unceasingly.
 Mr. Bradsher: I was talking to people in a market, and there was one man that said he voted for you but wished you would work harder. Is there more that can be done, or do you think your government is already doing everything, and if so, how do you persuade the people of Taiwan, including the people who voted for you?
 President Ma: As a president, I have to work for everyone whether they voted for me or not. Some of the efforts we have made have not generated results yet. For example, regarding the infrastructure projects, there is a relatively long process of bidding and other relevant measures before the money could enter the economy. The shopping vouchers were easier; people just need to spend them. We will see tangible results of the new infrastructure projects probably in spring or later this year. Actually, right after we came into office we started to expand domestic demand with a smaller project about $2.5 billion. Now all projects have gone through the bidding process, and we will be seeing results in the next couple of months. For the 2009 budget, we have already appropriated $10 billion for infrastructure projects.
 Mr. Bradsher: Are you paying a price on this reliance on exports, and if so, what happens if you make yourself more into the Asia trade and innovation hub that you want to be?
 President Ma: The financial tsunami makes it possible to rethink our economic development strategy as to whether we should rely so much on exports. When the times were good everyone praised us. Now times are bad, we think we should attach more emphasis on domestic demand instead of putting all our eggs in one basket. This is exactly what we're doing now. In Taiwan, some of our infrastructure facilities need upgrading as the case for the U.S. Roads, bridges, schools, etc. This is a good time to spend in these areas. By the time the economy recovers we will have the chance to expand. Taiwan is an island, so we have to depend on international trade for our survival. We can't change that fact completely. The tsunami won't last forever, so we will still attach a lot of importance to exports. But perhaps the percentage won't be that large. 
 Mr. Bradsher: Are you satisfied that the rule of law has been followed in the prosecution of your predecessor, Mr. Chen Shui-bian?
 President Ma: Since the Special Investigation Division (S.I.D.) started investigating the former president when he stepped down I have taken a hands-off attitude. The S.I.D. was actually established by the former president himself, and the current prosecutor general was appointed by him. The former first lady was indicted three years ago. Therefore, the whole case and its development have nothing to do with my administration. And I will do everything in my power to maintain judicial impartiality. This is vital to our democracy. I have always maintained this principle since I was the justice minister. All the prosecutors were under my command, but I didn't interfere in any individual cases. I set the policies, but didn't get involved in any individual cases. Now I am the president. I should keep a distance from all judiciary cases to ensure that they are properly handled by prosecutors without any political interference of any kind. 
 Mr. Bradsher: I remember when you were the justice minister you were particularly zealous in going after corruption cases. Were you directing prosecutors under you to look into specific corruption cases then? 
 President Ma: I only set policies. For example, I attached a lot of importance to vote buying, but I never specified which case the prosecutors should go after. That's their job. My job was to say, ''Let's put more resources in vote buying corruption cases.'' That yielded very tangible results. For example, in 1994 we had elections of local city/county councils and council speakers. There were 883 city/county council members and we indicted 341, almost 40 percent, many of whom belonged to my political party. It's very important to keep the government clean, and I'm still doing that. I've asked my prime minister to launch a program to maintain high standards of government official ethics in receiving gifts and attending banquets. People have been so dissatisfied with government ethics in the last nine years. Actually, I won the election on my campaign for a clean government. I will never get involved in particular cases. I will stay out of the judiciary. This is a very important principle of democracy. 
 Mr. Bradsher: There was a banquet last month in which a prosecutor raised her hand in a gesture that suggested she was a political prisoner. What is your reaction to that? I think the justice minister does not think that would compromise the impartiality of the judicial process. But to an American or to people like Jerome Cohen that seemed like a troubling case of prosecutors mocking defendants in a case that has not yet been tried. 
 President Ma: I heard that it was a skit program by some of the prosecutors and it was not intended to humiliate anyone. Still the skit was not received well by society; I understand the justice minister has advised those involved to avoid such behavior in the future. Also the case has already been in the court so the skit has not influenced the decision of the judges. It's very important to keep the judiciary free from political interference. 
 Mr. Bradsher: Were you aware in advance of the decision to consolidate the trial of your predecessor with that of his wife, with the result that the panel of judges was changed and the new panel sent him back to jail?
 President Ma: No, because the two cases involved by and large the same people and had the same effects. Usually, the judiciary would like to combine the two so they won't be tried by a different panel of judges. For those in the judicial circle, this is quite common. 
 Mr. Bradsher: But the timing of it caught people's eye, that it happened immediately after the decision to release Mr. Chen from the detention center.
 President Ma: As far as I know, it was a request by the panel of judges that had released the former president without bail, because they thought their case, a later one, should be combined with the earlier case. But the panel of the earlier case didn't express any legal opinion, so it was decided by the higher court instead of by the panels. But, for those who are familiar with the judicial process, this is not unusual at all. 
 Mr. Bradsher: How did you feel about the comment by Mr. Jerome Cohen? I know you have known him since your time at Harvard. Is it sad for you to see the criticism that he has been leveling at you lately?
 President Ma: I think he has been very concerned about Taiwan's judiciary development and human rights. Certainly we appreciate that. He suggested that we set up an independent committee to make decisions on a number of things, but he probably did not understand that we have a permanent independent commission, our Control Yuan. It has the power to correct the behavior of the judiciary but not the judicial decision on specific substantive cases. For instance, the Control Yuan said that some of the prosecutors who met with the former president were behaving inappropriately. It asked the S.I.D. to change the behavior. Some people think the Control Yuan should do it later instead of now because this could interfere with the current prosecution process. But in any case, we already have an independent commission. There is no need to set up another one. 
 Four years ago the Legislative Yuan did set up a commission to investigate the shooting of the president and the vice president, but the Council of Grand Justices later ruled that the composition of the commission was unconstitutional. So the commission didn't really work out well, and as such its report wasn't as credible as it could be. So when Mr. Cohen visited here, I said to him that that should be left to the Control Yuan. Later Mr. Cohen wrote a piece praising the government for abolishing a statue on taking hooligans into custody, which he has been criticizing for three decades because of its lack of human rights safeguards. Yesterday, we made a decision to ratify the two human rights conventions of the U.N. so that we could enhance Taiwan's human rights protection in line with the rest of the world. We also want to identify all those areas that need improvements. This is very much an important part of my policy. 
 Ms. Moore: What response have you had from the mainland to your intentions to ratify these conventions?
 President Ma: Well, we haven't heard anything yet. I'm sure they're aware of it because I've been talking about it since last year. It was also part of my campaign platform to enhance the human rights standards here. The New York-based Freedom House came to Taiwan last month to announce their Report on Freedom of the World. It was the first time for that group to come out of the U.S. to do that, and their idea is that Taiwan has made significant strides in the last several decades. From 1972 to 1975, when Freedom House first released its Report on Freedom of the World, Taiwan was rated not free. From 1976-96 Taiwan was rated partly free, and beginning in 1997 was rated free until now. While some of our critics say that Taiwan's freedom and democracy deteriorated in the last year, but the report announced we are still the same. There are two parts in the report: one is civil liberties, which we scored grade one, and for political rights we are grade two. Put together we're still in the free category. I asked why our political rights are on the second tier, but they were vague in their answer. We suspect it has something to do with corruption because last year and the year before that, government corruption had tarnished our image. 
 Ms. Moore: If you ratified the conventions it would put the spotlight back on Beijing for having the U.N. seat but not having ratified these UN conventions. 
 President Ma: There can be a competition across the Taiwan Strait on this, which should be in the interest of everyone.
 Mr. Bradsher: One thing to Americans that is surprising about the detention is this concept of detention incommunicado. It dates from 1946 Republic of China detention law, and there has been a review by the Justice Ministry whether you should retain this two-month detention plus an additional two month for complicated cases. You're deciding to retain it; is it really necessary? It seems like a long time: Japan is 10 days, and in the U.S. you have to charge someone almost immediately. 
 President Ma: It's not in the review. Actually the Council of Grand Justices recently ruled that the meeting between the detainee and his lawyer should not be recorded by video, which was done in the past. In other words, now the detainee can have confidential conversations with their lawyers. The Detention Act is also being reviewed by the Justice Minister so that the detainees can receive better treatment. The detention center is different from jail, because those detainees are not criminals yet. But sometimes the distinction is blurred, and that should be corrected, and I agree. So the justice minister is doing that, and I encourage her to do that as quickly as possible. As far as the former president is concerned, the treatment he has received was not solely directed at him; it is equally applied to all detainees.
 Mr. Bradsher: One DPP (Democratic Progressive Party, the party of former President Chen and the current opposition) person said that President Ma is setting a precedent for trials of former presidents as we've seen in South Korea -- ''Is he creating a precedent for a future trial of himself if the DPP administration were to go looking?''
 President Ma: That depends on if I committed a crime or not. Actually, two years ago I was indicted on corruption charges. I didn't complain that this was political persecution. I just hired a lawyer and went through the entire judiciary process, three levels of courts, 13 appearances in courts, eventually I won every level and I was acquitted last year in April. When I was indicted, the KMT (the currently governing Nationalist Party) was not in power, and nobody came to my rescue. But I am a lawyer by profession, and I respect the judiciary. I didn't criticize the judiciary as being partial. Eventually all the judges accepted argument that I neither had the intention nor committed any crime of corruption. So when I was asked by journalists about what I think about the former president's case, my response is very simple: ''I will not get involved.'' I will only use that case to reflect on myself with regards to what is the proper behavior as the president of a country. 
 Mr. Bradsher: Would you consider a pardon for your predecessor to spare the country?
 President Ma: In this country a pardon cannot be given until the whole process is complete, so it's premature to say anything in this regard. 
 Mr. Bradsher: One possibility is that there might be a plea deal in which Mr. Chen might agree to plea guilty to something and then receive a bargain as part of that broader arrangement; has there been any discussion of that?
 President Ma: This is left entirely for the court to decide -- I have no comment whatsoever.
 Mr. Bradsher: In cross-straits relations, it seems that you're still focusing on economics and investments but very little said on security issues like military confidence-building measures. 
 President Ma: Some of the economic issues are more urgent. For instance, in the proposed third meeting between SEF (Straits Exchange Foundation) and ARATS (Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits) later this year, they have to negotiate the issue of a financial supervisory mechanism, to sign an MOU (memorandum of understanding). There will be interchange between the financial industries of the two sides. We also need to finalize deals on scheduled flights and a mechanism for cooperation to combat crimes across the Taiwan Strait.
 Keith Bradsher: Are you disappointed there has not been more interest on the part of the security establishment on the mainland in having discussions on confidence-building measures?
 President Ma: No, that's not the case. In a statement Mr. Hu Jintao made on December 31, 2008, he specifically mentioned security cooperation and CBMs. Yet we should move gradually from economic issues. Both sides haven't really discussed the issue of international space. But we have made our intentions known to them and their positive responses have already created a more peaceful environment between the two sides in the international arena. For instance, in the eight and half months since we've come into office there has not been any upheaval in relations with our diplomatic allies. We said very clearly that we will not try to win over the recognition of their allies, and we expect the mainland to reciprocate in kind. 
 They understand there is good will on our side to have reconciliation not only across the Taiwan Strait but also in the international arena. We don't really have to engage in hard bargaining to get results; obviously they understand we intend to maintain peace in the region and in the international community. This is well understood and appreciated by many of our friends such as the U.S., E.U., Japan. Recently, there was a former American official who said that our action is almost universally welcomed.
 Ms. Moore: They understand you want peace and representation in international organizations such as the World Health Organization, but that doesn't mean they're going to give it.
 President Ma: No, it doesn't mean we can get what we want, but they also understand that if Taiwan continues to be isolated in the international arena, cross-strait relations will not develop very smoothly. There is a clear link between cross-strait relations and our international space. We're not asking for recognition; we only want room to breathe. At the moment they have 171 allies, while we only have 23. There is very little marginal utility for them to gain recognition from our allies. As long as we are not pursuing a policy of de jure independence there is no urgency on their part to compete with us in the international arena. This is something many of our friends in Washington, Tokyo, Brussels, appreciate very much. In a nutshell, we are trying to work as peacemakers instead of troublemakers.
 Ms. Moore: When are you going to Beijing?
 President Ma: No urgency at the moment. What I have in mind is to create a situation where the two sides can really coexist peacefully. I will not engage the other side on unification talks. Neither will I pursue a policy of de jure independence, and I'm definitely opposed to the use of force. These policies truly reflect the will of the people here. There is a Taiwanese professor whose wife is the magistrate of Yunlin county. They came from a pro-green family (slang in Taiwan for supporters of the DPP) and the professor wrote a piece most recently calling for 50 years peace with the mainland, no unification, no independence, no use of force, exactly what I've been calling for and promoting. Therefore, I believe my mainland policies are gaining momentum in not only the blue camp (KMT supporters) but in other sectors of Taiwan society. This is probably the most viable path for Taiwan. This will certainly benefit Taiwan, the region and the entire world. 
 Mr. Bradsher: Do you have any message to the Obama administration and Mrs. Clinton?
 President Ma: I was impressed with the congratulatory letter that then-candidate Obama sent me when I was elected. He specifically mentioned to restore the mutual trust between the U.S. and Taiwan. His letter was very well advised and knowledgeable. First, we hope we can continue the current cooperative mechanism and strengthen our mutual trust. Certainly, we depend on the support from the U.S. for our security. We also appreciate any cooperation and encouragement from the US side for our endeavors with the Chinese mainland. Other issues we would like to discuss with the U.S. include free trade; if possible, we could sign an FTA. There is also the issue of negotiating the import of U.S. beef with bone as well as possibly signing an extradition treaty so that we could have our fugitives at large extradited back here. We also hope Taiwan to be granted visa waivers by the U.S. Two days ago London announced that we would get visa waiver for students and tourists. If we are able to do that with the U.S., obviously Taiwan tourists to the U.S. will increase dramatically. This is true with Japan. After both countries decided to waive visa requirements, the number of tourists surged. 
 Furthermore, when we are able to reduce the flashpoint in the Taiwan Strait, there is a marked improvement for the situation on both sides of the Pacific. My message is both Taiwan and the U.S. keep up the good work and together we will benefit everyone. 
 Mr. Bradsher: Is there a risk for the U.S. to lose closer relations with Taiwan?
 President Ma: No, we have very close relations with the U.S.

HEADLINE: What We Don't Know Will Hurt Us

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
AND so on the 29th day of his presidency, Barack Obama signed the stimulus bill. But the earth did not move. The Dow Jones fell almost 300 points. G.M. and Chrysler together asked taxpayers for another $21.6 billion and announced another 50,000 layoffs. The latest alleged mini-Madoff, R. Allen Stanford, was accused of an $8 billion fraud with 50,000 victims.
 ''I don't want to pretend that today marks the end of our economic problems,'' the president said on Tuesday at the signing ceremony in Denver. He added, hopefully: ''But today does mark the beginning of the end.''
 Does it? 
 No one knows, of course, but a bigger question may be whether we really want to know. One of the most persistent cultural tics of the early 21st century is Americans' reluctance to absorb, let alone prepare for, bad news. We are plugged into more information sources than anyone could have imagined even 15 years ago. The cruel ambush of 9/11 supposedly ''changed everything,'' slapping us back to reality. Yet we are constantly shocked, shocked by the foreseeable. Obama's toughest political problem may not be coping with the increasingly marginalized G.O.P. but with an America-in-denial that must hear warning signs repeatedly, for months and sometimes years, before believing the wolf is actually at the door.
 This phenomenon could be seen in two TV exposes of the mortgage crisis broadcast on the eve of the stimulus signing. On Sunday, ''60 Minutes'' focused on the tawdry lending practices of Golden West Financial, built by Herb and Marion Sandler. On Monday, the CNBC documentary ''House of Cards'' served up another tranche of the subprime culture, typified by the now defunct company Quick Loan Funding and its huckster-in-chief, Daniel Sadek. Both reports were superbly done, but both could have been reruns.
 The Sandlers and Sadek have been recurrently whipped at length in print and on television, as far back as 2007 in Sadek's case (by Bloomberg); the Sandlers were even vilified in a ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch last October. But still the larger message may not be entirely sinking in. ''House of Cards'' was littered with come-on commercials, including one hawking ''risk-free'' foreign-currency trading -- yet another variation on Quick Loan Funding, promising credulous Americans something for nothing. 
 This cultural pattern of denial is hardly limited to the economic crisis. Anyone with eyes could have seen that Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire resembled Macy's parade balloons in their 1998 home-run derby, but it took years for many fans (not to mention Major League Baseball) to accept the sorry truth. It wasn't until the Joseph Wilson-Valerie Plame saga caught fire in summer 2003, months after ''Mission Accomplished,'' that we began to confront the reality that we had gone to war in Iraq over imaginary W.M.D. Weapons inspectors and even some journalists (especially at Knight-Ridder newspapers) had been telling us exactly that for almost a year.
 The writer Mark Danner, who early on chronicled the Bush administration's practice of torture for The New York Review of Books, reminded me last week that that story first began to emerge in December 2002. That's when The Washington Post reported on the ''stress and duress'' tactics used to interrogate terrorism suspects. But while similar reports followed, the notion that torture was official American policy didn't start to sink in until after the Abu Ghraib photos emerged in April 2004. Torture wasn't routinely called ''torture'' in Beltway debate until late 2005, when John McCain began to press for legislation banning it.
 Steroids, torture, lies from the White House, civil war in Iraq, even recession: that's just a partial glossary of the bad-news vocabulary that some of the country, sometimes in tandem with a passive news media, resisted for months on end before bowing to the obvious or the inevitable. ''The needle,'' as Danner put it, gets ''stuck in the groove.''
 For all the gloomy headlines we've absorbed since the fall, we still can't quite accept the full depth of our economic abyss either. Nicole Gelinas, a financial analyst at the conservative Manhattan Institute, sees denial at play over a wide swath of America, reaching from the loftiest economic strata of Wall Street to the foreclosure-decimated boom developments in the Sun Belt. 
 When we spoke last week, she talked of would-be bankers who, upon graduating, plan ''to travel in Asia and teach English for a year'' and then pick up where they left off. Such graduates are dreaming, Gelinas says, because the over-the-top Wall Street money culture of the credit bubble isn't coming back for a very long time, if ever. As she observes, it took decades after the Great Depression -- until the 1980s -- for Wall Street to fully reclaim its old swagger. Not until then was there ''a new group of people without massive psychological scarring'' from the 1929 crash.
 In states like Nevada, Florida and Arizona, Gelinas sees ''huge neighborhoods that will become ghettos'' as half their populations lose or abandon their homes, with an attendant collapse of public services and social order. ''It will be like after Katrina,'' she says, ''but it's no longer just the Lower Ninth Ward's problem.'' Writing in the current issue of The Atlantic, the urban theorist Richard Florida suggests we could be seeing ''the end of a whole way of life.'' The link between the American dream and home ownership, fostered by years of bipartisan public policy, may be irreparably broken.
 Pity our new president. As he rolls out one recovery package after another, he can't know for sure what will work. If he tells the whole story of what might be around the corner, he risks instilling fear itself among Americans who are already panicked. (Half the country, according to a new Associated Press poll, now fears unemployment.) But if the president airbrushes the picture too much, the country could be as angry about ensuing calamities as it was when the Bush administration's repeated assertion of ''success'' in Iraq proved a sham. Managing America's future shock is a task that will call for every last ounce of Obama's brains, temperament and oratorical gifts.
 The difficulty of walking this fine line can be seen in the drama surrounding the latest forbidden word to creep around the shadows for months before finally leaping into the open: nationalization. Until he started hedging a little last weekend, the president has pointedly said that nationalizing banks, while fine for Sweden, wouldn't do in America, with its ''different'' (i.e., non-socialistic) culture and traditions. But the word nationalization, once mostly whispered by liberal economists, is now even being tossed around by Lindsey Graham and Alan Greenspan. It's a clear indication that no one has a better idea.
 The Obama White House may come up with euphemisms for nationalization (temporary receivership, anyone?). But whatever it's called, what will it mean? The reason why the White House has been punting on the new installment of the bank rescue is not that the much-maligned Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, is incapable of getting his act together. What's slowing the works are the huge political questions at stake, many of them with consequences potentially as toxic as the banks' assets. 
 Will Obama concede aloud that some of our ''too big to fail'' banks have, in essence, already failed? If so, what will he do about it? What will it cost? And, most important, who will pay? No one knows the sum of the American banks' losses, but the economist Nouriel Roubini, who has gotten much right about this crash, puts it at $1.8 trillion. That doesn't count any defaults still to come on what had been considered ''good'' mortgages and myriad other debt, whether from auto loans or credit cards.
 Americans are right to wonder why there has been scant punishment for the management and boards of bailed-out banks that recklessly sliced and diced all this debt into worthless gambling chips. They are also right to wonder why there is still little transparency in how TARP funds have been spent by these teetering institutions. If a CNBC commentator can stir up a populist dust storm by ranting that Obama's new mortgage program (priced at $75 billion to $275 billion) is ''promoting bad behavior,'' imagine the tornado that would greet an even bigger bank bailout on top of the $700 billion already down the TARP drain.
 Nationalization would likely mean wiping out the big banks' managements and shareholders. It's because that reckoning has mostly been avoided so far that those bankers may be the Americans in the greatest denial of all. Wall Street's last barons still seem to believe that they can hang on to their old culture by scuttling corporate jets, rejecting bonuses or sounding contrite in public. Ask the former Citigroup wise man Robert Rubin how that strategy worked out.
 We are now waiting to learn if Obama's economic team, much of it drawn from the Wonderful World of Citi and Goldman Sachs, will have the will to make its own former cohort face the truth. But at a certain point, as in every other turn of our culture of denial, outside events will force the recognition of harsh realities. Nationalization, unmentionable only yesterday, has entered common usage not least because an even scarier word -- depression -- is next on America's list to avoid.

HEADLINE: Payroll Tax Cuts in Stimulus to Start April 1, Obama Says

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama said Saturday that the Treasury Department had begun to direct its employees to reduce taxes from the paychecks of workers, a move that should increase the take-home pay for typical families by at least $65 a month. 
 The reductions, to start on April 1, are the result of tax provisions in the $787 billion economic recovery package Mr. Obama signed into law last week. The president spotlighted them in his weekly radio and Internet address, which he used to promote the stimulus bill and to chart the immediate road ahead. 
 After a week dominated by programs that involve spending, Mr. Obama pledged to look for ways to ''cut the trillion-dollar deficit we inherited'' and said he was turning his attention toward restoring discipline to the nation's budget. 
 Mr. Obama said he would hold a ''fiscal summit'' at the White House on Monday to bring together business and union leaders, as well as financial experts and lawmakers. He will address a joint session of Congress on Tuesday and release his 2010 budget on Thursday.
 ''It will require doing all we can to get exploding deficits under control as our economy begins to recover,'' Mr. Obama said, promising to submit a budget that was ''sober in its assessments, honest in its accounting'' and that ''lays out in detail my strategy for investing in what we need, cutting what we don't and restoring fiscal discipline.''
 In the address, Mr. Obama described the stimulus package as ''the most sweeping economic recovery plan in history,'' saying it would put 3.5 million Americans back to work. 
 But Mr. Obama said the stimulus and housing measures could not, on their own, push the economy into recovery. 
 ''We can't produce shared prosperity without firm rules of the road,'' the president said, ''and we can't generate sustained growth without getting our deficits under control.
 ''In short, we cannot successfully address any of our problems without addressing them all.''

HEADLINE: To Investigate or Not: Four Ways to Look Back at Bush

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
-- Two days after his re-election in 1864, with Union victory in the Civil War assured, Abraham Lincoln stood at a White House window to address a boisterous crowd of supporters. He spoke of the lessons of the nation's calamitous recent history.
 ''In any future great national trial, compared with the men of this, we shall have as weak and as strong; as silly and as wise; as bad and as good,'' Lincoln said. ''Let us, therefore, study the incidents of this as philosophy to learn wisdom from, and none of them as wrongs to be revenged.''
 Today there are new calls for such study, not universal but certainly loud enough, directed this time at the Bush administration's campaign against terrorism. Interrogation techniques that the United States had long condemned as torture, secret prisons beyond the reach of American law and eavesdropping on American soil without court warrants are at the top of a lot of lists. 
 But as Lincoln knew, one man's wisdom is another's vengeance. Repeatedly in American history, and in ''truth commissions'' in some two dozen countries from Argentina to Zimbabwe since the 1980s, it has turned out to be a tricky business to turn the ferocious politics of recent events into the dispassionate stuff of justice and the rule of law. 
 A USA Today/Gallup poll this month found that 62 percent of Americans favor either a criminal investigation or an independent panel to look into allegations of torture. Still, many people, primarily Republicans, insist the Bush policies were vital to protect the country, and the Obama administration is treading gingerly. When Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee, proposed a commission to investigate torture and eavesdropping, President Obama didn't embrace the idea.
 Already grappling with two wars and an economic meltdown, Mr. Obama said he was ''more interested in looking forward than I am in looking backwards.'' But the door was ajar; he also declared that ''nobody is above the law.''
 Mr. Leahy is undeterred. In an interview, he laughed and described the president's remarks as ''an enthusiastic endorsement.'' He said he would work to build support for the idea in Congress.
 As a senator under seven presidents, Mr. Leahy said, he has learned that the temptation to abuse powers in a crisis is bipartisan, and the commission's review should include the role of Democrats in Congress in approving the Bush policies. The work should be done in one year, he added, to avert accusations that it was being dragged out for political gain.
 Mr. Obama's most enthusiastic supporters remain passionate about ''looking backwards,'' arguing that the Bush policies darkened the United States' reputation, to Al Qaeda's benefit. They include Representative John Conyers of Michigan, the House Judiciary chairman, who has sponsored a bill to set up an investigative panel. 
 Many Republicans, however, say the lofty appeals to justice and history mask an unseemly and dangerous drive to pillory the Bush administration and hamstring the intelligence agencies.
 That was precisely the view of an aide in Gerald Ford's White House named Dick Cheney when a Senate committee led by Frank Church of Idaho looked into intelligence abuses in the mid-1970s. A quarter-century later, as vice president, Mr. Cheney would effectively wreak vengeance on that committee's legacy, encouraging the National Security Agency to bypass the warrant requirement the committee had proposed and unleashing the Central Intelligence Agency he felt the committee had shackled. 
 If advocates of looking back have their way, what are the options? Some past inquiries offer models, each with different potential winners and losers.
 A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION (IRAN-CONTRA)
 Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said at his confirmation hearing that he, like Mr. Obama, did not want to ''criminalize policy differences'' by punishing officials for acts they believed were legal. The same language was used in 1992 by President George H. W. Bush when he pardoned six officials charged in the Iran-contra investigation. Mr. Bush called the charges ''a profoundly troubling development in the history of our country: the criminalization of policy differences.''
 The Iran-contra case illustrates the obstacles to any prosecution that unfolds in a polarized political atmosphere. An independent prosecutor, Lawrence E. Walsh, worked for six years to untangle shady arms deals, defiance of Congress and a cover-up. But because of the pardons and court rulings, the key figures escaped all punishment except large legal fees and damaged reputations.
 The sharpest critics of the Bush programs insist that only prosecution can restore the law to its proper place. They note that some 100 terrorism suspects have died in American custody and say a prosecution for conspiracy to torture could target both the high-level officials who approved the likes of waterboarding and lawyers who justified it.
 But many legal experts believe that the Justice Department would be hard pressed to prosecute as torture methods that the department itself declared in 2002 not to be torture. And if an important goal is to determine who devised the policies, a push to prosecute might only persuade past officials to lawyer up and clam up. 
 A CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION (CHURCH)
 If there is a close precedent for the investigation now being debated, it is the inquiry led by Senator Church in 1975-76, which recorded in stunning detail some of the darkest chapters in American history. Its reports chronicled the C.I.A.'s bumbling attempts to assassinate foreign leaders; the N.S.A.'s watchlisting of civil rights and antiwar activists; and the F.B.I.'s campaign to drive the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to suicide.
 The reports led directly to a series of reforms, including President Ford's ban on assassinations, the creation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to approve national-security eavesdropping and the establishment of Congressional oversight of the intelligence agencies.
 But some Republicans saw Mr. Church as a showboat and his committee as overreaching. To Mr. Cheney, the Church legacy was a regrettable pruning of the president's powers to protect the country -- powers he and Bush administration lawyers reasserted after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
 A BLUE-RIBBON PANEL (9/11 COMMISSION)
 Though Mr. Leahy praised the Church Committee, his own proposal would take the investigation away from Congress in favor of ''a group of people universally recommended as fair minded.'' He also suggested subpoena power and, perhaps most important, a South Africa-style trade-off: immunity for officials who testify truthfully.
 Investigative commissions date at least to 1794, when George Washington used one to negotiate a settlement of the Whiskey Rebellion. The 9/11 commission, a recent example, largely overcame partisanship and drew generally positive reviews.
 A commission would free Congress to focus on current problems, including the economic crisis. And promises of immunity might answer concerns expressed last month by the departing C.I.A. director, Michael V. Hayden -- that any investigation would discourage intelligence officers from acting boldly for fear of later second-guessing.
 DOING NOTHING
 Or more accurately, finishing up and rolling out the inquiries already under way. Even if the push for a broad investigation loses momentum, the Bush programs will not soon be forgotten. Among major inquiries expected to conclude soon: a report from the Justice Department's ethics office on legal opinions justifying harsh interrogations; the criminal investigation of the C.I.A.'s destruction of interrogation videotapes; and a report by the Justice Department inspector general on the N.S.A.'s warrantless eavesdropping.
 Meanwhile, thousands of documents relating to secrets of the Bush years are being sought by journalists and advocates. Mr. Obama has directed agencies to lean strongly toward disclosure. 
 Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., who served as chief counsel for the Church Committee and has called for a new commission, said there is no telling what a thorough investigation may turn up. He recalled his shock as he sat in a secure room at the C.I.A. in 1975 and read that the agency had recruited the Mafia in a scheme to kill Fidel Castro.
 ''It may seem that we already know a lot,'' Mr. Schwarz said. ''But based on my experience, I'm certain there's a lot that went on the last eight years that we still don't know.''

HEADLINE: Real Estate Agents, In Search of New Tools

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
SELLERS and buyers are not the only jittery players in today's housing market. Real estate offices along Main Streets throughout Westchester County, N.Y., are struggling to stay in business during one of the worst markets in decades, and at the same time shift away from their traditional job description to become more competitive players on the Internet.
 Reflecting the grave state of the market, Houlihan Lawrence, a family-owned real estate company dating from the 1950s, announced on Feb. 13 that it was laying off 10 percent of its employees -- although not its sales agents, who work as independent contractors. 
 During the past six months, the company has shuttered 5 of its 30 offices and is planning more closings as it increasingly conducts business on the Web, said Chris Meyers, the chief operating officer.
 ''It's all part of our down-market strategy,'' Mr. Meyers said. ''Since September the economy has been in a rapid decline, and we can't run faster than this wave any longer.'' 
 The company is also increasingly advertising on the Web and establishing business alliances with online listing sites like Trulia.com.
 But as the agencies themselves change tactics, so must the agents, said Mark Boyland, the president of the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. ''The old model of a sales agent who just takes listings, hosts a couple of open houses, and places an ad or two is not enough anymore,'' he said.
 A new breed of agent is emerging, wise in the ways of short sales and other foreclosure-avoidance techniques. ''That's going to be a large part of the business going forward into the next several years,'' said Mr. Boyland, who is also an associate broker for Keller Williams in White Plains. ''Lots of homeowners have lost jobs and had their salaries and/or hours reduced, and they're in trouble.''
 According to RealtyTrac.com, 2,259 Westchester homes are in preforeclosure (meaning that their owners have defaulted on the mortgage, but that formal proceedings have not yet begun), 237 are about to be auctioned and 358 are about to be taken over by banks. Adjustable-rate mortgages that are scheduled to be reset this year could affect those numbers, said Alex Charfen, the president and chief executive of the Distressed Property Institute in Boca Raton, Fla. 
 Mr. Charfen's company offers courses in foreclosure-avoidance techniques and short sales, among other things, for real estate agencies. The Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service and several real estate agencies are offering classes and seminars on the new financing. Houlihan Lawrence, for instance, has opened a training center to teach agents the use of networking tools like Facebook and LinkedIn, as well as other Internet marketing techniques. 
 As Bill Holmes, the president of Prudential Holmes & Kennedy, put it: ''Agents have to know so much more when making a sale today. There are just so many roadblocks in the way.''
 Holmes & Kennedy, which serves Westchester and Putnam Counties, has laid off workers, Mr. Holmes said, but it has not closed any of its six offices.
 ''We're really all waiting to see what the news may be from D.C.,'' he said. ''Hopefully then we'll have a better understanding of where things are headed.''
 Still, with the number and dollar value of sales plummeting, and far less business to go around, a sizable number of agents are fleeing the field, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive of the listing service. At the end of 2008, the service had a membership of 7,628; by the end of this year, he predicted, that number would be closer to 7,100.
 ''We're witnessing wrenching changes,'' he said, adding that several mergers and acquisitions were also taking place. ''It's no surprise the industry is contracting.''
 Prudential Rand recently acquired Shaw Properties in Yonkers, Nelson-Vrooman Associates in White Plains and Gibbons Realty in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. Greg Rand, an owner, said the agency would be announcing more acquisitions in the coming months. Prudential Rand has 20 offices in the Hudson Valley, 7 of them in Westchester. 
 Meanwhile, in a move that seems counterintuitive in light of all this contraction, a real estate company has opened an office in Scarsdale, N.Y.: Engel & Volkers, which is based in Hamburg, Germany, and has 400 offices worldwide.
 ''The local agencies are missing half of the market,'' said Jonathan Lerner, the managing director of the company's new franchises in Scarsdale and Southampton, N.Y. ''Buyers today are as likely to come from Berlin as from Boston.'' 
 As for opening in a down market, Mr. Lerner said: ''Maybe it's not such a bad time. If the market was so great, we'd have a much harder time getting some of those experienced people the other agencies are laying off to work for us. Some things about this market may not be that bad after all.''

HEADLINE: Nation's Governors See a Dismal Economic Outlook and a Slow Recovery

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The nation's governors said Saturday that passage of a $787 billion bill to stimulate the economy might help them avert draconian budget cuts, but that they did not expect to see signs of an economic recovery until late this year or early 2010.
 The officials, arriving here for the winter meeting of the National Governors Association, said that state revenues were coming in far below their projections and that the new federal measure, while helpful, would not be a panacea. 
 Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. of Utah, where the economy is better than in most states, said the revenue figures were ''still dismal.'' 
 Asked when the recovery would start, Mr. Huntsman, a Republican, said: ''We were hoping in the fourth quarter of this year. But I think many are pushing it now into 2010.''
 Gov. Steven L. Beshear of Kentucky, a Democrat, said: ''If the experts are correct, next year may be even worse than this year. I think very probably they are correct.''
 The stimulus law cuts taxes and provides billions of dollars to the states for education, transportation, Medicaid and energy and environmental projects.
 Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington, a Democrat, said: ''The recovery will be very, very slow. We are the most trade-dependent state in the nation. Since November, I've lost $4.2 billion of projected revenues in a $32 billion budget. We fell off a cliff.''
 The chairman of the governors association, Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, said he had not seen any hint of a recovery, ''not yet.'' 
 Based on revenue estimates in the middle of last year, Mr. Rendell said, he had expected a $1.6 billion deficit. But because of plunging state revenues, he said, he increased his deficit forecast to $2 billion and then last month to $2.3 billion. Likewise, Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri, a Democrat, said, ''We've seen a huge dip in revenues.''
 Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, a Republican, said his state would receive $12.2 billion over three years as a result of the stimulus law. But Mr. Crist added, ''We still have declining revenues and have to cut the budget.''
 Mr. Nixon said the economic crisis had created an opportunity. ''We will use the new federal money to transform the economy,'' he said, ''to build not just roads and bridges, but also human capital, investing in education and job retraining.''
 Some Republican governors, like Mr. Crist, Jim Douglas of Vermont and Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, supported the stimulus bill. Some, including several possible contenders for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, denounced it as a bloated behemoth. A handful of Republican governors have caused a stir by saying they would turn down some of the federal money.
 Two such Republicans, Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, said they would accept federal money for transportation projects but would not take money linked to an expansion of eligibility for unemployment insurance, because it would lead to an increase in taxes on employers.
 ''If you want more people to work, you don't tax job creation,'' Mr. Barbour said. He criticized the stimulus law, saying: ''It's filled with social policy and costs too much. You could create just as many jobs for about half as much money.''
 Mr. Jindal said he would take advantage of another provision of the new law to increase unemployment benefits by $25 a week, financed entirely with federal money. 
 Mr. Douglas, the vice chairman of the National Governors Association, played down the split among Republicans. He predicted that most Republican governors would, in the end, accept most of the federal money.
 Democrats taunted the Republicans, saying they should support the economic recovery plan or reject all federal help.
 ''You can philosophize in D.C. all you want, but we in the states have to get things done,'' said Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. ''A governor's job is to deliver for people: to create good jobs, to keep criminals in prison, to educate children, to make sure we have decent roads. This recovery package does that.''
 Moreover, Mr. Schweitzer said: ''It's a little late for Republican governors to get high-minded about accepting federal dollars. This recovery legislation represents only a small share of all the federal money states receive.''
 Nathan Daschle, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, said, ''If Republican governors do not want this money, Democratic governors will put it to good use.''

 BODY:
In many circles, class size is considered as fundamental to education as the three R's, with numbers watched so carefully that even a tiny increase can provoke outrage among parents, teachers and political leaders. Alarms went off in New York and California last week, as officials on both coasts warned that yawning budget gaps could soon mean more children in each classroom.
 But while state legislatures for decades have passed laws -- and provided millions of dollars -- to cap the size of classes, some academic researchers and education leaders say that small reductions in the number of students in a room often have little effect on their performance. 
 At recent legislative hearings on whether to renew mayoral control of the New York City schools, lawmakers and parents alike have asked, again and again, why Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Chancellor Joel I. Klein have not done more to reduce class size. On Tuesday, the Education Department issued a report that found the average number of children per class increased in nearly every grade this school year. 
 ''If you're going to spend an extra dollar, personally, I would always rather spend it on the people that deliver the service,'' Mr. Bloomberg said when asked about the report on Thursday, calling class size ''an interesting number.''
 ''It's the teacher looking a child in the eye, and teachers can look lots of children in the eye,'' he added. ''If you have to have smaller class size or better teachers, go with the better teachers every time.''
 But Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan, a Queens Democrat who is chairwoman of the Education Committee, said that she routinely hears from middle-class parents who say they are leaving the city in search of intimate classroom environments where teachers can pay more attention to each student. The teachers' union estimates that New York City's classes have 10 percent to 60 percent more students than those in neighboring suburbs, and the highest average size of any school district in the state. 
 ''I always thought more money and the mayor controlling the schools would give us smaller classes,'' said Ms. Nolan, who has a son in public school. ''I just don't understand it, but they seem to be nostalgic for a time of larger classes.'' 
 The debate has continued for decades, with some consensus forming that class size matters most in the youngest grades, and that the effects are most profound when there are fewer than 20 students in a class.
 Dan Goldhaber, an education professor at the University of Washington, said the obsession with class size stemmed from a desire for ''something that people can grasp easily -- you walk into a class and you see exactly how many kids are there.''
 ''Whether or not it translates into an additional advantage doesn't necessarily matter,'' Professor Goldhaber said. ''We know that teachers are the most important thing, but teacher quality is not stamped on someone's forehead.'' 
 A Tennessee study in the late 1980s, widely regarded as the most influential study on class size, found that in kindergarten through third grade, students in classes of 13 to 17, particularly poor and minority students, performed better than those in classes of 22 to 25. In some cases, the benefits extended through high school.
 But since then, as many states and school districts have rushed to reduce class sizes, usually to the low 20s, student achievement has not consistently improved markedly.
 In California, a 1996 law provided schools with an extra $1,000 in state money for every student in the earliest grades whose classes had 20 or fewer students. The state quickly hired 28,000 new teachers, but many of them lacked experience or education credentials; a 2002 study by the Public Policy Institute of California found that the best-qualified teachers fled poorer urban schools as the extra funds created jobs in wealthier areas, and that children who were in smaller third-grade classes did not have higher scores on fifth-grade tests. 
 In New York City, an Education Department comparison over the last two years between school report-card grades and average class size has found little correlation; in many cases, schools with better grades have bigger classes. 
 Still, some researchers argue that reducing class size is a concrete and worthy goal.
 ''We can say we just want more good teachers, which would be great, but that's a policy that we just don't know how to do yet,'' said Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, an education policy professor at the University of Chicago. ''The nice thing about reducing class size is that it makes teachers happy in their own right and it's the one thing that we know how to do.'' 
 In New York, class sizes increased despite an infusion of $150 million in state funds last year earmarked specifically to reduce the numbers of children in each room. Chancellor Klein initially bristled at the restrictions state officials put on the money, but Albany would not release the funds until the city submitted a plan to bring class sizes down further. Last week, the city said it might have to adjust that plan to ''reflect the worsening economic climate.''
 Christopher Cerf, the deputy chancellor in charge of human resources, said the increase in class sizes this school year could be attributed to principals who determined that their money was better spent elsewhere and that the focus on class size was wrongheaded. ''People think that this is the keys to the education reform kingdom here, but that is simply not the case,'' he said.
 Garth Harries, who oversees class size for the city, said that better schools often end up with larger classes as more and more parents want to send their children to places with successful track records. ''It's a complicated trade-off,'' he said. ''Would you end up giving fewer families access to those schools?'' 
 But Leonie Haimson, the executive director of an advocacy group, Class Size Matters, and a frequent critic of the administration, scoffed at the suggestion that parents were happy with larger classes, saying, ''The department is just trying to escape accountability.'' 
 ''Most of our elementary schools are zoned for a neighborhood, and to blame it on parents is absurd,'' she noted. ''You have more than 40 percent of students attending schools that are overcrowded. That's not something they choose.''

HEADLINE: Cutting Slack Is So Old School

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
-- There was hardly a Republican on the list of those rewarded with shout outs from President Obama last week when he signed his $787 billion economic recovery package into law in the towering, sun-dappled atrium of a Denver museum.
 The ''best vice president that we've had in a long time,'' that is, Joseph R. Biden Jr., in Mr. Obama's vaunting prose, was there. So was ''one of the outstanding leaders who helped shepherd this process'' -- Senator Max Baucus of Montana -- along with three House Democrats from Colorado. Representative Mark Udall, was a no-show, but ''let's give him a round of applause anyway,'' the president implored. The crowd complied with gusto.
 The one-sidedness in Denver underscored what remains the best-known statistic of the numbers-laden stimulus: only three Republicans voted for it. But it also underscored another political truth about the disappearance, at least in its familiar definition, of ''the loyal opposition.'' 
 The concept of a loyal opposition -- that the party out of power can oppose the government without trying to overthrow it -- is, of course, as old as the United States itself. ''We are all Republicans -- we are all Federalists,'' Thomas Jefferson declared in at his first inaugural, heralding the birth of the American multiparty system 
 Eventually, the concept of the ''loyal opposition'' came to mean that a president, especially a new one elected by comfortable majority, could expect cooperation from the other side, in deference to the will of the voters. But in the partisan politics of recent decades, another view developed, advanced by Congressional leaders like Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, that the minority party has the right, even obligation, to stick to its ideological principles.
 Some longtime Washington power-brokers are uncomfortable with this more partisan-based notion of loyalty. John Warner, former Republican senator from Virginia, is one. 
 ''This president has been duly and fairly elected, no question whatsoever,'' Mr. Warner said, ''and he must be given the opportunity to exercise leadership of his own choosing consistent with the will of the people who put him in office. That's not meant that we all stand there like a bunch of pigeons on the roof, but let's try to give him the benefit of the doubt for a reasonable period of time.''
 Mr. Warner, who celebrated his 82nd birthday last week, cited the example of Wendell Willkie, who lost to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940, but then became Roosevelt's personal emissary to Britain and the Middle East. There are more recent instances of similar cross-party cooperation, if not loyalty. President George W. Bush, though denied a plurality of the vote in 2000, nonetheless gained some Democrats' cooperation in passing tax cuts and his No Child Left Behind education plan. 
 And Ronald Reagan, who swept into office in 1980 as one of the most ideologically driven candidates in modern history, secured the support of 48 Democratic votes in the House and 37 in the Senate for his tax cuts. That was not so much a sign that Democrats were large-hearted, but rather that the party included moderates who believed Mr. Reagan's election signaled a broad, popular mandate for change. 
 Since then the number of moderates in both parties has dwindled. So has the practice of ticket-splitting, where voters choose a presidential candidate from one party and a Congressional candidate from the other. Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, one of the three Republicans who voted for Mr. Obama's stimulus bill, points out that in the late 1980s there were 56 senators elected on split tickets. By 2006, when Ms. Snowe last ran for re-election, the number was down to 25, she said. 
 Ms. Snowe says Mr. Reagan's situation differed significantly from Mr. Obama's; Mr. Reagan's chief challenge was to forge a working accommodation with Democrats, who ran Congress, while Mr. Obama's task is to rein in his own party. Mr. Obama erred when he failed to include Republicans at the bill-writing stage, Ms. Snowe said.
 During a private meeting with the president earlier this month, Ms. Snowe said, she urged him to adopt the Reagan strategy of working ''with people in swing districts like mine.'' 
 Not that those Senate votes are easily won. ''Anybody who breaks ranks pays a political price, and so people have become more risk averse,'' Ms. Snowe said. ''I think we should be doing everything we can to develop positions to appeal to the broader inclination of the majority, but that is not true in the political dynamic of today.''
 That dynamic is rooted in the bitter partisan warfare of the 1990s. Alan Ehrenhalt, the editor of the magazine Governing, a policy monthly, suggests that a turning point came in 1992. Bill Clinton had won the presidency with only 43 percent of the vote, and the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, informed the president-elect that Republicans would filibuster any significant legislation, meaning Mr. Clinton would need to amass 60 votes to get a bill through the Senate. 
 ''I don't know that I would argue that new presidents deserve more deference than established presidents; what deserves deference is majority rule,'' Mr. Ehrenhalt said. ''If we had majority rule in the United States Senate we wouldn't even be talking about the stimulus and the fact that Republicans didn't vote for it -- it would have passed weeks ago.''
 Republicans haven't cornered the market for blocking presidential initiatives. Democrats were so successful at filibustering Mr. Bush's judicial nominees that their Senate leader, Tom Daschle, was labeled ''an obstructionist'' and lost his seat in 2004.
 Today it is the Republicans who find themselves accused of obstructionism. Mr. Gingrich, a veteran -- and, some would say, the architect -- of the hard-edged 90s, has emerged as a mentor to the current Republican House minority, in particular Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House minority whip whose efforts ensured that not a single House Republican voted for Mr. Obama's stimulus bill. 
 Mr. Gingrich scoffs at the notion of the ''loyal opposition.'' 
 ''You are loyal to the nation,'' he said, ''not the temporary possessor of power. I think any president deserves the opportunity to make a proposal, and that proposal should be listened to seriously. But it is foolish for a president to assert that they have prime ministerial authority.''
 Besides, there are political gains to be made by standing tough. Mr. Gingrich sees the stimulus bill as his party's ticket to a revival in 2010, as Republicans decry what they see as pork-barrel spending for projects like marsh-mouse preservation. ''You can imagine the fun people will have with that,'' he said. 
 But opposition, or obstructionism, can be a risky game. Robert Dallek, a biographer of both John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, suggested that cooperating with a popular new president can benefit the party out of power. For instance, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, Democratic leaders like Johnson and Sam Rayburn stressed the virtues of bipartisanship, fearing that ''if they caused Eisenhower grief, the party would pay a price for it,'' Mr. Dallek said.
 The stimulus vote, of course, is not the final word on the Obama presidency; the president will go to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to deliver his first address to a joint session of Congress. On Thursday he will submit his first budget proposal, which the White House says will include detailed initiatives on energy and health care. Mr. Obama has said he hopes his attempts to bring Republicans on board will pay off in the future. Mr. Warner, for one, is trying to be optimistic that the loyal opposition is not gone for good.
 ''Tomorrow's another day,'' he said. ''Let's hope we can find common ground.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 8, 2009

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the role of the loyal opposition in politics referred incorrectly to an item in the stimulus bill recently signed into law. The article repeated a frequent but incorrect Republican assertion that the bill directs money specifically to mouse-marsh preservation. It does not. 
 The article also misstated the title of Mark Udall. He is a senator from Colorado; he is no longer a representative.

HEADLINE: First Chores? You Bet

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 CONSIDER the perils of parenting in the White House. 
 There is a movie theater, a bowling alley, a horseshoe pit, a swimming pool, five full-time chefs and dozens of household staff members ready to dish up ice cream at all hours. There are trips to foreign lands, dinners with kings and celebrities, swarming paparazzi and blaring motorcades, all with the potential to transform sweet little children into bossy, self-important ones. (Or lonely, dysfunctional ones.)
 What are presidential parents to do?
 Lay down the law, according to the newest parental unit in the executive mansion. President Obama and his wife, Michelle, might not be in Chicago anymore, but they say the old rules still apply when it comes to their daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7. 
 In the Obama White House, bedtime is still at 8 p.m. The girls still set their own alarm clocks and get themselves up for school in the morning. They make their own beds and clean their own rooms. And when the much-anticipated pet arrives, they will walk the dog and scoop its poop.
 ''That was the first thing I said to some of the staff when I did my visit,'' Mrs. Obama said in an interview with ABC News, describing her talks with White House employees. ''Don't make their beds. Make mine. Skip the kids. They have to learn these things.''
 Even as Mr. Obama tackles the recession and Mrs. Obama embraces the role of first lady, the Obamas are finding their footing as parents in the White House. They strive, and even struggle at times, to balance the intense public interest in their family with their desire to preserve a sense of normalcy and privacy in the lives of their daughters, according to relatives, friends and television and magazine interviews with the Obamas themselves. 
 Mr. Obama is a modern-day dad who leaves the Oval Office for dinner with his girls, rarely misses a parent-teacher conference or piano recital and prides himself on having read all seven books in the Harry Potter series aloud with Malia. 
 Mrs. Obama juggles play dates and homework with speeches to federal agencies and students. Both are committed to keeping their daughters grounded, their friends and aides say.
 ''Those are some special girls, and everyone is rooting for them to make it through this intact,'' Craig Robinson, Mrs. Obama's brother, said in an interview. 
 The president echoed that sentiment. ''Right now, they're not self conscious. You know, they don't have an attitude,'' Mr. Obama said on CBS News. ''And I think one of our highest priorities over the next four years is retaining that.'' 
 The Obamas have long believed that rules and routine help children thrive, particularly during unsettling times. During the presidential campaign, Mrs. Obama stuck so firmly to the 8 p.m. bedtime rule that Mr. Obama sometimes had to scramble to catch his daughters awake.
 ''Michelle won't keep them up just to talk to their father,'' Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to the president and a family friend, told The New York Times in 2007. ''Bedtime is part of their normalcy. It isn't going to be interrupted because he's at a fund-raiser.''
 But as every parent knows, there are rules, and then there is reality. 
 SO while the Obamas place a high premium on healthy, organic foods, the girls eat cake at birthday parties and often indulged in ice cream and other snacks on the campaign trail.
 They limit television, but do not restrict viewing to the Discovery Channel. (The girls have been big fans of ''American Idol,'' ''Hannah Montana'' and the Cheetah Girls.) 
 They take turns saying grace at dinner, but have not gone to church every Sunday in recent years. There is no spanking, but lots of discussion about actions and consequences. 
 Mr. Obama said he tried to give Malia a regular allowance -- $1 a week -- but that fell by the wayside during the hectic presidential campaign. Still, he insists that the first lady, known among her friends as the taskmaster, is not the sole disciplinarian. ''I'm not a softie,'' Mr. Obama said during the ABC interview, in which he said that his wife could certainly ''holler at them a little bit.''
 Susan Davis, one of Mrs. Obama's friends, said the Obamas have tried hard to keep their daughters from becoming spoiled or self-important. ''They don't act entitled,'' she said. ''They just seem like kids.'' 
 What the Obamas want most, friends and relatives say, is for their little girls to continue to feel like little girls. So Mrs. Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, has moved in, and the girls will keep up with their regular activities, said Susan Sher, an adviser to the president and one of Mrs. Obama's close friends.
 Mrs. Obama, Ms. Sher said, is ''someone who sees the humor and likes to joke. Fun is very important.''
 The Obamas are guided by their own experiences. Mr. Obama, who grew up without his father, has described his determination to be an active force in his children's lives. Mrs. Obama flourished in a stable two-parent household that valued structure and routine.
 Since both came from families that struggled financially at times, they emphasize that good things don't always come easily. And over the years, Mrs. Obama has stressed the importance of manners and compassion. 
 Still, history suggests that raising happy, well-adjusted and well-behaved children in the White House is no easy task. 
 President Carter, a strong advocate of public education, enrolled his daughter, Amy, 9, in public school, but she was initially very lonely, according to journalists who covered her. President Theodore Roosevelt coped with the antics of his teenage daughter Alice, who was derided as ''a scarlet woman'' for smoking in public and partying late at night. President Grover Cleveland's wife, Frances, was pilloried for closing the south grounds of the White House so her baby could enjoy sunny days without being kissed by tourists.
 Shielding children from the public is harder today with 24-hour news sites, celebrity bloggers, gossip magazines and newspapers all vying for tidbits. The cameras are kind now, but they can be less so as children enter the teenage years.
 ''It's not going to be normal -- it can't be normal,'' Doug Wead, a former Bush family adviser, said of the Obama girls' childhood. 
 ''All of their best efforts are not going to change the fact that being a child of a president presents unique challenges,'' said Mr. Wead, the author of ''All the Presidents' Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America's First Families.''
 Mr. Wead said that children of presidents often struggle to determine which friends are true friends and to establish an identity separate from that of their parents, an issue that often lingers long after the family leaves 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
 The Obamas, who want to create a more open, accessible White House, have wrestled with how much they should open up about their family. They allowed the girls to be interviewed on ''Access Hollywood'' in July and later said they regretted it. 
 They discussed parenting on television, and Mrs. Obama and her girls posed for a photo that landed on the cover of US Weekly this month. But the first lady also pressured the company Ty Inc. into pulling its Sasha and Malia dolls from the market, and her aides discourage reporters from writing in detail about the girls. Mr. and Mrs. Obama declined to comment for this article.
 The balancing act is not uncommon to presidential families, who are famously reluctant to talk about their child-rearing in the White House. (The Clintons and the Carters -- the most recent families with young children -- also declined requests for interviews.) But some former first children emphasize that life in the White House can be extraordinary. 
 President George W. Bush's daughters, Barbara and Jenna, described sliding down banisters when their grandfather was president and dining with royalty when their father led the country. ''It is a magical place at any age,'' they wrote in an open letter to the Obama girls. Indeed, Mrs. Obama is looking forward to traveling with her daughters and showing them the world, her aides say.
 And after a grueling presidential campaign, Mr. Obama says fatherhood has rarely felt sweeter.
 ''It turns out I've got this nice home office,'' Mr. Obama said in an interview on NBC this month. ''And at the end of the day, yeah, I can come home, even if I've got more work to do, I can have dinner with them,'' the president said. ''I can help them with their homework. I can tuck them in. If I've got to go back to the office, I can.''
 Barclay Walsh and Jodi Kantor contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Hold the Eulogies, Kennedy Says

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After the president of Harvard hailed him as a ''national leader but a local servant,'' after the pastor read the ''Let us now praise famous men'' passage from the Bible and after the cellist Yo-Yo Ma honored him by performing a Gershwin prelude, Senator Edward M. Kennedy lumbered across the antique stage.
 ''I have lived a blessed time,'' Mr. Kennedy told the audience at a special honorary degree convocation at Harvard in December. His voice started shaky, but gained strength. ''Now, with you, I look forward to a new time of high aspiration for our nation and the world.''
 As the crowd rose, Mr. Kennedy waved buoyantly, as if trying to acknowledge everyone he saw: a special fist pump for his former staff member, Justice Stephen G. Breyer of the Supreme Court; a salute in the direction of Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.; a thumbs-up for his niece Caroline Kennedy. 
 Mr. Kennedy's wife, Vicki, tried to lead him off, but he broke away, grinning. For a few extra moments, he kept the stage. 
 Since the diagnosis of his brain cancer last May, Mr. Kennedy has been given all manner of tributes and testimonials, lifetime achievement awards, medals of honor and standing ovations. But even as those accolades have provided sweet solace -- and even some dark humor -- as he endures grueling treatments, Mr. Kennedy, who turns 77 on Sunday, has been intent on racing time rather than looking back on it. 
 He considers unnecessary what his son Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island calls ''the premature eulogizing,'' or what Mr. Biden terms ''a bordering on an obituary,'' that has accompanied his life in recent months.
 ''Obviously I've been touched and grateful,'' Mr. Kennedy said in a phone interview Friday from the rented home in Miami where he has spent most of the winter. ''Beyond that, I don't really plan to go away soon.''
 Friends who have seen Mr. Kennedy describe him as driven and focused on work. He sometimes gets angry watching C-Span, pores over memorandums and speed-dials staff members and colleagues (sometimes from his sailboat, the Mya). He speaks frequently -- and often on his trademark issue, overhauling the nation's health care system -- to President Obama; Mr. Biden; the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel; and checks up on the Senate ''chatter'' with lawmakers. 
 Between chemotherapy treatments, physical therapy sessions and naps, Mr. Kennedy has been lobbying the White House on possible nominees for secretary of health and human services. (He has heard good things about the leading candidate, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas, though he does not know her well and has been pressing for other candidates.) 
 While his office said he planned to return to Washington in a few weeks, Mr. Kennedy has been orchestrating efforts from afar, setting the foundation for legislation on what he calls ''the cause of my life.'' 
 ''What has been essential to his recovery and motivation has been setting goals,'' said Dr. Lawrence C. Horowitz, a former Kennedy staff member who has been overseeing his care. The first goal the senator set after cancer surgery in June was to speak at the Democratic National Convention (he did, despite kidney stones); then he resolved to attend Mr. Obama's inauguration (he did, though he had a seizure afterward). 
 ''Now, his goal is to play a central role in health care reform,'' Dr. Horowitz said. ''That's what keeps him going.''
 Wired for Optimism
 Still, as perception can be reality in politics, Mr. Kennedy and his allies have been battling an inescapable sense that his time is too short or he is too ailing to be effective -- a notion reinforced last month when people close to Caroline Kennedy seemed to blame her uncle's health problems for her sudden loss of interest in being appointed to a Senate seat from New York. 
 Mr. Kennedy says he is wired to be optimistic. ''That's the way I was born and brought up,'' he said. ''That's the way we're dealing with the challenges we're facing now.''
 Until the brief phone interview with The New York Times, Mr. Kennedy had given no interviews since the cancer diagnosis, aside from a few brief hallway remarks to reporters on his sporadic Senate forays and public events. He declined multiple requests over several weeks for a longer, in-person interview.
 Even so, people who have spent time with him say Mr. Kennedy is talking more about his past and that of his family than he typically has, in part because he is writing a memoir and it stirs memories. (''Remind me, Vicki, to put that in the book,'' has become a familiar refrain.) He can be sentimental at times -- wiping his eyes at the Harvard service during a slideshow of his career. And his illness has provoked something of a bipartisan crush of affection by people who have had personal and professional dealings with him.
 ''The fact that he has cancer leads people suddenly to try to put into perspective what he has done over time,'' Justice Breyer said in an interview in his chambers. ''That makes them tend to appreciate him more, whatever their politics.'' 
 It is oddly typical of Mr. Kennedy's life that, for instance, the president of Chile would travel to his house on Cape Cod to present the Order to the Merit of Chile (a spokesman said the award had been announced before he became ill). The Kennedy Center in Washington is holding a belated birthday gala for him on March 8. His friends have pointed out this accumulation of accolades, and not without some wryness.
 ''It's the goal of every Irishman to be able to be a witness to your own eulogy,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. ''This is sheer heaven for him.'' Hearing Mr. Dodd's words repeated on Friday, Mr. Kennedy let loose with a rollicking laugh.
 Praise and Vilification
 Over 46 years in the Senate, Ted Kennedy has been an all-too-human repository for larger-than-life emotions. Colleagues praise his lengthy legislative resume and personal kindnesses, often in superlative terms: ''the most remarkable senator I've ever worked with'' (Mr. Biden), ''the single most effective member of the Senate'' (Senator John McCain of Arizona). 
 Critics have vilified him as a run-amok liberal and an out-of-touch elitist, a longtime playboy involved in a car crash that killed a young woman. In certain political quadrants, his name is akin to profanity even now. Ann Coulter calls him a ''drunken slob'' in her new book, while various bloggers, radio hosts and other conservative commentators have said far worse. 
 Mr. Kennedy said he planned to spend Sunday -- his birthday -- having a quiet celebration with members of his family. His answers were brief on matters pertaining to his illness and life generally, and he repeatedly steered the conversation back to health care and what he called ''this unique and special time'' to pass major legislation.
 Colleagues say no one has a better grasp of the variables involved in developing such legislation than Mr. Kennedy, who is chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 
 ''He said to me one day, 'Look, there are about 15 ways for this to happen,' '' said Senator John Kerry, his fellow Massachusetts Democrat. '' 'But you've got to find the one to make it happen.' He just has a sense of these things.''
 Mr. Kennedy describes the Senate as a ''chemical place,'' meaning that reading the chemistry between members is critical to understanding how an issue or a vote will play out. Removedfrom it, he has been frustrated, fellow Democrats say. 
 Mr. Kennedy's office has twice pushed back his return date to Washington, raising questions about how well his recovery is proceeding. His staff and family have released limited information about his condition. He said he felt strong, and friends say he has recovered from the June surgery to remove part of the tumor. 
 Dr. Horowitz said, ''He is doing very well, considering that he has a serious disease.'' He adds that the ''unanimous consensus'' of Mr. Kennedy's team of doctors is that ''his disease is totally under control.'' 
 Still, the prognosis for patients with malignant glioma, the type of brain tumor Mr. Kennedy has, is generally poor. (Survival is variable, experts said, but is generally measured in months from the time of diagnosis.) The senator has also had at least two seizure episodes that required hospitalization. He tires easily and needs frequent rest.
 ''Obviously some days are better than others,'' Mr. Kennedy said.
 Some colleagues privately acknowledge worrying that Mr. Kennedy may lack the physical stamina to meet the demands of forging a health care overhaul bill this year. 
 To ease Mr. Kennedy's comings and goings, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, has given him a plum corner office, about 30 feet from the Senate floor, next to an elevator. When Mr. Kennedy came to Washington to vote on the economic stimulus bill this month, he flew on a government jet, arranged by the White House. ''I'll have to pace myself,'' Mr. Kennedy acknowledged of meeting the demands of a fuller workload. ''But I come from New England stock here.''
 ''What is necessary, I'll do,'' he added.
 Mr. Kennedy, who campaigned hard for Mr. Obama before he became ill, is clearly eager to play a role in the first year of the new administration. By all accounts, he was exuberant at Mr. Obama's inauguration. ''It's a great day, it's a great day,'' he told a stream of well-wishers, conspicuous in a black fedora and blue scarf and sitting in an oversize chair on the Capitol dais about 10 feet from where Mr. Obama was sworn in. 
 Michelle Obama went over with her daughters, Sasha and Malia, for a visit. Mr. Kennedy, who like roughly 99 percent of the world's population knows that the Obama girls have been promised a puppy, took the occasion to lobby for Portuguese water dogs (Mr. Kennedy has two, Sunny and Splash).
 At the airport the night before, Patrick Kennedy encountered Roger Wilkins, the civil rights leader, who hailed his father as a hero. Patrick passed this on to his father, who said, ''You really need to start writing this stuff down.''
 The Personal Touch
 After the swearing-in, Mr. Kennedy repaired to a Congressional luncheon, where he mingled with colleagues and ate a meal of pheasant and seafood stew. Before dessert, he was rushed to a hospital after a seizure. The next day, Mr. Kennedy called Mr. Biden to check up on his 15-year-old granddaughter, who had witnessed the incident. 
 ''I'm sorry if I upset your granddaughter,'' the vice president recalled him saying. Mr. Kennedy also sent Mr. Biden's 91-year-old mother flowers (he told her she looked wonderful at the inauguration).
 Stories of such gestures from Mr. Kennedy have abounded. Few politicians rival him at the just-checking-in phone call, the scribbled note or the goofy buck-up gift. Mr. Biden recalled how Mr. Kennedy showed up at his home while he was recovering from a brain aneurysm years ago, armed with an inspirational photograph of a giant Irish stag. 
 These are recent examples:
 When Mr. Kennedy learned that former Senator Tom Daschle's brother was fighting the same type of brain cancer, the senator put him in touch with his doctors and opened his Boston home to him while he received treatment. He also offered assistance to the conservative columnist Robert D. Novak, a fierce critic of his, when Mr. Novak learned last year that he had a similar cancer.
 He was one of the few to call to congratulate Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico when he was nominated to be commerce secretary and later to console him when he withdrew over questions about his relationship with a donor. ''He always starts it off with some personal thing, in my case singing the song 'Jalisco' in Spanish,'' Mr. Richardson said.
 Mr. Kennedy insisted on accompanying former Senator John Culver, a former Harvard classmate who was about to undergo back surgery, to the Harvard-Yale game in November despite protests that it was a bad idea. Harvard won 10-0. ''It was a great day,'' Mr. Culver said.
 Such efforts have won Mr. Kennedy bipartisan good will, which has been returned since he became ill. 
 ''I got elected to Congress in 1972 running against the Kennedys,'' said former Senator Trent Lott, a onetime Republican leader. ''Forget liberal, conservative, moderate, whatever,'' he said of Mr. Kennedy. ''He's a damn nice guy.''
 Last November, shortly after the election, President George W. Bush invited Mr. Kennedy and three other lawmakers to the Oval Office to mark the passage of a bill requiring insurance companies to cover mental and physical health equally, an issue Mr. Kennedy had worked on for years.
 Mr. Bush had signed the measure in October, but Mr. Kennedy could not attend, so the president staged a mock signing. They posed for photographs behind Mr. Bush's desk (once used by Mr. Kennedy's brother John), along with Patrick Kennedy and the bill's other co-sponsors.
 Mr. Kennedy was perhaps Mr. Bush's most important Democratic partner in the Senate on education and immigration issues, and maybe his toughest critic on most everything else, especially the Iraq war. Mr. Bush, who had called and written to Mr. Kennedy several times after he became ill, told the senator that he always admired him as an opponent and appreciated that he knew where he stood with him.
 ''I've had more trouble with my friends than with my opponents,'' Mr. Bush told Mr. Kennedy in the Oval Office, according to his son. Patrick mentioned the burden of living up to his father's example, prompting Mr. Bush to reply: ''Believe me, I know that feeling all too well.''
 After a while, nearly everyone was escorted out, leaving Mr. Bush and Senator Kennedy alone. As aides watched, they walked out the back of the Oval Office, Mr. Kennedy maneuvering a cane.
 Weathered by years and battles, the dynastic heirs lingered outside, talking about sports, the election and the future. They shook hands for a final time before Mr. Bush walked Mr. Kennedy to his car and waved goodbye.

HEADLINE: Obama Planning To Slash Deficit, Despite Stimulus

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After a string of costly bailout and stimulus measures, President Obama will set a goal this week to cut the annual deficit at least in half by the end of his term, administration officials said. The reduction would come in large part through Iraq troop withdrawals and higher taxes on the wealthy.
 Mr. Obama's budget outline, which he will release on Thursday, will also confirm his intention to deliver this year on ambitious campaign promises on health care and energy policy.
 The president inherited a deficit for 2009 of about $1.2 trillion, which will rise to more than $1.5 trillion, given initial spending from his recently enacted stimulus package. His budget blueprint for the 2010 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, will include a 10-year projection showing the annual deficit declining to $533 billion in the 2013 fiscal year, the last year of his term, officials said. 
 While that suggests a two-thirds reduction, exceeding Mr. Obama's goal of at least half, advisers note that the current deficit as a starting point is inflated by one-time expenses to stimulate the economy. 
 Measured against the size of the economy, the projected $533 billion shortfall for 2013 would mean a reduction from a deficit equal to more than 10 percent of the gross domestic product -- larger than any deficit since World War II -- to 3 percent, which is the level that economists generally consider sustainable. Mr. Obama will project deficits at about that level through 2019, aides said.
 In his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday, Mr. Obama said his first budget was ''sober in its assessments, honest in its accounting, and lays out in detail my strategy for investing in what we need, cutting what we don't, and restoring fiscal discipline.''
 ''We can't generate sustained growth without getting our deficits under control,'' he added.
 The president will propose to tax the investment income of hedge fund and private equity partners at ordinary income tax rates, which are now as high as 35 percent and could return to 39.6 percent under his plans, instead of at the capital gains rate, which is 15 percent at most.
 Senior Democrats in Congress joined with Republicans in 2007 to oppose that increase. But with Wall Street discredited and lucrative executive compensation a political target, the provision could prove more popular among lawmakers. 
 Mr. Obama will also call for letting the Bush tax cuts on income, dividends and capital gains lapse after 2010 for individuals who make more than $250,000 a year. But while the top rate for income would rise to 39.6 percent, the top rate for capital gains and dividends would be 20 percent. 
 As a candidate, Mr. Obama called for immediately repealing those tax cuts. He decided instead to keep them in place through 2010, as scheduled, reflecting the widespread belief that raising taxes further depresses economic activity.
 As for war costs, Mr. Obama's campaign projected that withdrawing combat troops from Iraq would save about $90 billion a year. But it is not clear how much any savings would be offset by increased spending in Afghanistan, where Mr. Obama has ordered an additional 17,000 troops, bringing the total there to 56,000.
 The budget will provide the first clues to how Mr. Obama will reassert fiscal discipline after signing into law a $787 billion economic recovery plan. As difficult as cutting the deficits will be, much of the reduction by the end of his term will simply reflect an end to spending from the two-year stimulus package and -- assuming the economy recovers -- higher tax revenues and lower expenditures for safety-net programs like unemployment compensation. 
 Mr. Obama will propose cutting a variety of programs, including the Medicare Advantage subsidies for insurance companies that cover seniors who can otherwise acquire health coverage directly from the government. Another target is spending on private contractors, especially for defense, which spiked during the Bush administration. And he will scale back some promises, including his proposal to double money for foreign aid.
 The budget on Thursday will come amid a week of reminders of the nation's fiscal plight. On Monday Mr. Obama will hold a ''fiscal responsibility summit'' at the White House with members of Congress from both parties, economists, union leaders and business representatives. On Tuesday he will make a televised address to a joint session of Congress -- the equivalent of a State of the Union speech for a new president -- that advisers said would focus on the economy. Meanwhile, Congress will debate $410 billion in overdue appropriations for this fiscal year.
 Yet Mr. Obama will inflate his challenge by forsaking several gimmicks that President Bush used to make deficits look smaller. He will include war costs in the budget; Mr. Bush did not, and instead sought supplemental money from Congress each year. Mr. Obama also will not count savings from laws that establish lower Medicare payments for doctors and expand the alternative minimum tax to hit more taxpayers -- both of which Mr. Bush and Congress routinely took credit for, while knowing they would later waive the laws to raise doctors' payments and limit the reach of the tax. 
 Full details of Mr. Obama's budget for the 2010 fiscal year will be released in April. The outline on Thursday will make clear that he intends to push ahead on promises to contain health care costs and expand insurance coverage, and to move toward an energy cap-and-trade system for controlling emissions of gases blamed for climate change.
 ''The president believes there are essentially three areas that have to move forward even as we pare back elsewhere -- health care, energy and education,'' said David Axelrod, his senior adviser. ''These are the bulwark of a strong economy moving forward.'' 
 While some people have predicted that Mr. Obama would have to shelve his priorities given rising deficits, his determination to proceed, especially on health care, reflects his economic advisers' conviction that the government cannot control its finances without reforming health care. The ballooning cost of health care, and thus Medicare and Medicaid, is the biggest factor behind projections of unsustainable deficits in coming decades.
 ''He wants to present an honest budget, he wants to focus on health care, and he will cut the deficit by at least half by the end of his first term,'' Peter R. Orszag, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in an interview.
 Mr. Obama will suggest in his budget that expanding health coverage to the more than 46 million uninsured can be done without adding to the deficit, both by making cost-saving changes in the delivery of care and by raising revenues. Advisers declined to identify the tax source.
 Changes to the health care system will require investments in disease prevention programs, health information technology and research on cost-effective treatments, among other steps. Some money was included in the stimulus package. Even so, many health analysts believe big savings cannot be realized soon. 
 On energy policy, Mr. Obama's budget will show new revenues by 2012 from his proposal to require companies to buy permits from the government for greenhouse gas emissions above a certain cap. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the permits would raise up to $300 billion a year by 2020.
 Since companies would pass their costs on to customers, Mr. Obama would have the government use most of the revenues for relief to families to offset higher utility bills and related expenses. The remaining revenues would cover his proposals for $15 billion a year in spendingand tax incentives to develop alternative energy.

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 Barack Obama's grandmother told him to smile more. Bill Clinton tells the new president to strut more.
 As the country takes a bullet train to bankruptcy, the last Democratic president urged the current one to ''embody'' that old American spunk. That spirit of -- as they sing in ''Oklahoma'' -- ''We know we belong to the land and the land we belong to is grand! A-YIP-I-O-EE-AY!'' 
 ''It's worth reminding the American people that for more than 230 years everyone who bet against America lost money,'' Clinton told Chris Cuomo on ''Good Morning America.'' ''I just want him to embody that and to share that.'' 
 It's rich. The Man from Hope whose Missus castigated Candidate Obama for raising ''false hopes'' is now criticizing President Obama for not peddling more gauzy hope. 
 Instead, he implies, the president's warnings of calamity, designed to gin up support for borrowing and printing trillions to shore up the sagging economy, might actually be dragging down our already sagging self-esteem.
 Says the ever-helpful Bill: ''I just want the American people to know that he's confident that we are going to get out of this and he feels good about the long run.''
 It's hard to muster moxie with stocks shriveling, Chris Dodd talking nationalization, and Paul Volcker making Chicken Little sound cheery -- ''I don't remember any time, maybe even in the Great Depression,'' he said, ''when things went down quite so fast, quite so uniformly around the world.''
 With this economy, as William Goldman famously said of Hollywood, ''Nobody knows anything.'' The only thing to fear is ... everything.
 We dutifully cut back on Starbucks macchiatos, designer water and even Girl Scout cookies, but we keep hurtling down.
 While W. and Dick conjured an alternative reality about Iraq, our avaricious bankers created an alternative reality about our financial system. Now our busted trust is not so easily fixed.
 In an Associated Press article headlined ''Obama Plans Eclipsing New Deal Spending,'' the Rutgers University political science professor Ross Baker notes, ''Not surprisingly, people are wary of some very expensive proposals with no guarantee of success or even a high probability of how well they'll work.''
 In The Times, Eric Dash reported that Wall Street is losing confidence in Washington's vague and shifting plans, sending shares of bank companies plunging to new lows on Friday. 
 President Obama disdains sound bites, and he does not have Bill Clinton's talent for reducing the abstruse to apercus. We wanted someone smart to gather a bunch of smart people around him to get us out of this fix. But Mr. Obama's egghead manner has failed to soothe a nation with the jits. Maybe he has been so intent on avoiding the stereotype of the Angry Black Man, as he wrote in his memoir, that it's hard for him to connect with and articulate public anger about our diminishment.
 Though he demonstrated in the campaign that he has a rare gift for inspiring the country with new belief in itself, Mr. Obama has not yet captured either the grit the moment requires or the fury it provokes. He has not explained in a compelling way why Americans who followed the rules need to sacrifice more to help those who flouted the rules.
 That is why the CNBC reporter Rick Santelli struck a populist nerve with his screed about the unfairness of responsible homeowners picking up the tab for irresponsible homeowners -- following the unfairness of taxpayers who are losing jobs, homes and savings propping up the exact same bankers and carmakers whose greed and myopia caused the economy to crash.
 He spoke for those who want a pound of flesh. With the Wall Street bailout, Mr. Obama at least gave bankers a bit of the belt, and capped their pay. But homebuyers who wanted more than they could afford seem to be getting a free ride.
 Yet Obama is oozing empathy compared with his attorney general, who last week called us ''a nation of cowards'' about race. 
 Eric Holder, who showed precious little bravery in standing up to Clinton on a pardon for the scoundrel Marc Rich, is wrong. We have just inaugurated a black president who installed a black attorney general. 
 We need leaders to help us through our crises, not provide us with crude evaluations of our character. And we don't need sermons from liberal virtuecrats, anymore than from conservative virtuecrats.
 In the middle of all the Heimlich maneuvers required now -- for the economy, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, health care, the environment and education -- we don't need a Jackson/Sharpton-style lecture on race. Barack Obama's election was supposed to get us past that.
 Besides, the president has other issues that demand his passion.

On a Bench
 If the troubled Knicks guard Stephon Marbury, above left, does not have a future in basketball, he may have one in comedy. 
 Slam Online recently featured videos of Marbury chatting at a bus stop with a filmmaker identified only as Brendan, above right. 
 The unusual pair discussed topics like the economy, tattoos and Marbury's interest in the Larry David television show ''Curb Your Enthusiasm.'' 
 Filmed on a street corner in Los Angeles, the video shows the two discussing Marbury's relationship with the Knicks. Brendan compares the situation to a bad breakup, but Marbury replies: ''I didn't break up. I was the girl that was trying to stay. Like: 'Baby, please don't do this to me! I can't live without you!' ''
 Four episodes of the show, dubbed ''Me and Stephon,'' are available on YouTube. 
 D-League's A-List Dunks
 This year's slam dunk contest was an entertaining affair, with Nate Robinson (in his kryptonite green outfit) winning with a dunk over Dwight Howard, the defending champion, on the Saturday night of All-Star weekend.
 But the night before, also in Phoenix, the N.B.A. Development League held its dunk contest, and the results were just as impressive, if not more so.
 James White of the Anaheim Arsenal, who played at the University of Florida before transferring to Cincinnati, won the contest, and his most impressive dunk might have been his first, which came from behind the free-throw line.
 Michael Jordan's famous dunk in the 1988 contest came from slightly in front of the free-throw line.
 White won the contest over the Tulsa 66ers' Keith Clark, who joined the D-League after being declared academically ineligible at Oklahoma. 
 He will be eligible for this year's draft. 
 Draftexpress.com has video and commentary of all the dunks.
 Interestingly, White lost the 2001 McDonald's High School All-American slam dunk contest to the current Knick David Lee.
 Faded Homecoming
 Los Angeles Clippers guard Baron Davis, above, has had a difficult first year back in his hometown after signing a five-year, $65 million contract during the off-season. 
 At 13-42, the Clippers are among the league's worst teams, and rumors swirled that Davis would be on his way out of town.
 On Feb. 11, Davis showed off what he could offer a contender, scoring 13 points and dishing 20 assists in a win against the Knicks. 
 But in the two games leading to the league's trading deadline, the Clippers decided to hold on to Davis. 
 At that point, things fell apart, with the Clippers allowing a staggering 282 points in consecutive losses to the Phoenix Suns.

FOOL'S PARADISE 
 Players, Poseurs, and the Culture of Excess in South Beach 
 By Steven Gaines 
 Illustrated. 274 pp. Crown Publishers. $25.95. 
 Those who might hesitate to pick up a modern social history of Miami Beach will be relieved to know that Madonna appears only briefly in ''Fool's Paradise,'' Steven Gaines's entertaining chronicle of sleaze and vapidity in the Florida tropics. 
 Madge is not missed, for there are plenty of other outrageous characters for Gaines to spotlight. Few are especially complex or compelling, but this is a book about South Beach. Most people don't go there for intellectual enrichment; they go for the sex, dope and parties. 
 That wasn't exactly the original idea. Back when the mangroves were razed and the sand was dredged from the ocean bottom -- yes, even the beach is fake -- the developer Carl Fisher envisioned the place as a respectable winter getaway for well-to-do Northerners, an American Riviera. 
 As it turned out, gangsters also prefer sunny climates over snow. By 1928, Al Capone and other thugs had discovered Miami Beach, and organized crime was taking over the town. Gambling, bootlegging and prostitution became vibrant sectors of the economy, and corruption was epidemic. Today Ecstasy has replaced smuggled Cuban rum as the nocturnal vice of choice, but the attitude hasn't changed. 
 As in ''Philistines at the Hedgerow,'' his wry dissection of the Hamptons, Gaines sees symptoms of social dysfunction in architecture, like the garishly emblematic Fontainebleau Hotel on Collins Avenue. It was the product of a tumultuous collaboration between an obstinant developer named Ben Novack and the architect Morris Lapidus. The two couldn't stand each other, and went to their respective deathbeds claiming sole credit for the design of the massive, weirdly curved structure, which was built in less than a year. 
 Maligned by critics, the Fontainebleau instantly became a lively hangout for card sharks, mobsters and movie idols. Frank Sinatra performed there regularly for 20 years -- free, according to Gaines -- and in return got unlimited use of a penthouse suite. Gaines asserts, ''The only thing Sinatra paid for was his hookers.'' Well, at least he didn't forget the little people. 
 The author cites a Justice Department memo suggesting that Sinatra sang gratis out of duty, because the Fontainebleau was secretly run by some of his Mafia pals -- a charge Novack always denied, even after he sold the place. 
 In any case, the resort had lost its gleam by the early '70s, and so had Miami Beach. Hotel Row faded toward shabbiness, while a new theme park called Disney World diverted millions of Florida-bound tourists upstate. The area called South Beach, from roughly 21st Street to Government Cut, was then home to thousands of elderly Jews who had migrated from the Northeast, only to see their apartment buildings crumble around them. It was not, as Gaines breathlessly declares, one of the worst slums in America. But life did get much more dangerous after the Mariel boatlift in 1980, when Fidel Castro salted a sea of fleeing refugees with thousands of hard-core criminals, the dregs of Cuba's prisons. Many of the worst headed for Miami Beach, where helpless victims were abundant. 
 Gaines's description of the ensuing crime wave isn't exaggerated -- there was authentic mayhem on the streets. Recalling that not-so-long-ago time makes the rebirth of the South Beach district seem all the more astounding, though it came at a cost. Most of the old folks were displaced, or died off in loneliness. 
 An influx of artists and a fierce preservation movement initiated the area's stunning turnaround, though some pop observers credit the television show ''Miami Vice.'' Certainly Michael Mann's cameras made the Art Deco esplanade of Ocean Drive look enticing, even as Sonny and Rico were shooting it out with Armani-clad cokeheads under the palms. With that kind of advertising, it's not surprising how the new Miami Beach turned out, and who showed up. 
 One successful poser was a gym rat from Brooklyn who called himself Chris Paciello. Twenty-three years old and unemployed, Paciello arrived in South Beach and within days somehow purchased a nightclub, which he refurbished as a local dive. After that burned down, under predictably disputed circumstances, Paciello opened a club called Liquid, which soon became the hottest draw for models, actors and pro athletes. 
 Paciello's real name was Christian Ludwigsen, and he was a violent felon who federal investigators believed was tied to organized crime families. When his mottled resume was illuminated by The Village Voice, it only enhanced Paciello's studly stature. The club crowd thought it was way cool to hang with a genuine goon. 
 According to Gaines, Madonna phoned Paciello on his 27th birthday, singing, ''Happy birthday, dear mobster, happy birthday to you!'' The following year he was charged with racketeering and bank robbery, as well as felony murder in connection with a botched home-invasion heist on Staten Island. He copped a plea, ratted out a dozen no-neck pals and swaggered off to prison, leaving South Beach temporarily without a pied piper. 
 If Paciello returned tomorrow, he could be on top again in no time. That's the sort of place SoBe is. As one party promoter told Gaines, ''People will forgive anything for a good time.'' They should etch those words on the city's seal. 
 Gaines evidently spent many nights hanging with the young, beautiful and clueless. Shockingly, they take lots of drugs and have lots of stoned sex and then wonder what it all means. They are walking, talking cliches in a town that is ebulliently cliche, but it doesn't mean there's not an occasional glimmer of insight. 
 Listen to a male fashion model named Matt talk about his season on South Beach: ''Well, for months now I've been living in a shallow, delusional place. I've lived in a society with absolutely no culture and where money and fame are everything. . . . I began to wonder, 'Is this really it? Is it that simple? Am I really such an incredible guy because I look like this?' '' That's not Jay Gatsby ruminating -- just some kid trying to figure out when to bail. 
 Gaines is a good interviewer, and he does plenty of legwork. One of the best parts of ''Fool's Paradise'' is his visit with Alex Daoud. As the flashy mayor of Miami Beach in the '80s, Daoud packed a pistol and rode with a rogue crew of cops that stomped suspects in back alleys. Daoud was also a gregarious crook, taking bribes and favors from dope dealers, bankers, even the owners of a strip joint. 
 The mayor, too, turned snitch and did a prison stretch. He now manages a modest apartment building, whines about his weight and implores anyone who will listen to read his own self-published tell-all. Daoud declares, ''Miami Beach is a non-place populated by rootless people.'' 
 He's only half-right. There is a there there, and many people, like the preservationist Barbara Capitman, have given it their hearts. Yet, throughout the eras of Capone, Sinatra and Madonna, South Beach's economy has always been juiced by sybaritic hype and a stream of fun-loving, fast-talking mooks. It has never, thank heaven, aspired to be a family destination. 
 These days the club scene still cooks, but the heat of the '80s and '90s is gone. Gaines cites as a transformational event the 1997 murder -- assassination, to be precise -- of the fashion designer Gianni Versace on the steps of his Ocean Drive estate. The killing shook SoBe in the same way that John Lennon's murder shook Manhattan, yet Gaines skates over the bizarre crime in a few paragraphs. 
 The fact is, in any South Beach bar you'd do well to find more than a handful of patrons who know anything about Versace. Most of those on the dance floor would still have been flossing their braces when he was gunned down. 
 It's not the fault of Gaines that, from gorgeous airheads to slimy swindlers, ''Fool's Paradise'' is overpopulated by characters straight out of central casting. That's the story of Florida. As any journalist can attest, just because a place is shallow, corrupt and infested with phonies doesn't mean it's dull. 
 In fact, there's probably not another square mile of American real estate more amusing than South Beach, in small doses and with the proper precautions.

HEADLINE: Enough About You

BYLINE: By HOLLY BRUBACH

 BODY:
Paris Hilton, with her cellphone full of pictures of herself, is here. As are Lindsay Lohan, who declared herself a role model to ''younger generations as well as generations older than me''; Britney Spears, the teen-queen train wreck; Barry Bonds, the probably-not-all-natural home-run hero; and Bode Miller, the Olympic party boy. Sadly, Jelena Jankovic, the tennis star riveted by her own image during instant replays on the Jumbotron at last year's U.S. Open, and Madonna, who has parlayed self-absorption and exhibitionism into a multimillion-dollar career, didn't make the cut. But for Jean M. Twenge and W. Keith Campbell, psychologists and authors of ''THE NARCISSISM EPIDEMIC: LIVING IN THE AGE OF ENTITLEMENT'' (Free Press), the challenge must have been not finding examples but deciding which ones to leave out. 
 Twenge and Campbell contend that ''the United States is currently suffering from an epidemic of narcissism.'' No argument here. But do we really need a book to tell us what the S.U.V. that's taking up two parking spaces already makes clear? As it turns out, we do. 
 The evidence Twenge and Campbell have compiled is compelling and appalling. Never mind the celebrities; their arrogance is equaled if not surpassed by the grandiosity of so-called average Americans. Like Allison, the Atlanta teenager featured on MTV's series ''My Super Sweet 16,'' who wants Peachtree Street blocked off for her birthday party so that she can make a ''grand entrance.'' When the planner reminds her that Peachtree is a major thoroughfare with a hospital where ambulances come and go, she replies: ''They can wait one second. Or they can just go around.'' 
 A Web site called hotornot.com, where people post pictures of themselves for strangers to rate their sex appeal, has clocked more than 12 billion votes. A company called Celeb 4 a Day offers a package deal for a night on the town that includes six ''personal paparazzi,'' a fake publicist and a bodyguard, plus a limo and a tabloid mock-up with the client's picture on the cover. In 2006, Time magazine made ''You'' the person of the year. 
 Heinz Kohut, the psychoanalytic theorist, first identified narcissistic personality disorder in 1971; by 1980, it was included in the DSM-III, the official catalog of psychiatric disorders. Enough time has since elapsed that there is now an extensive body of scientific research on narcissists, their behavior and their motivations. Twenge and Campbell marshal statistics, polls, charts, studies and anecdotes to assemble a complete picture of the epidemic's current state of contagion, brought on by the Internet, reality television, a booming economy, easy credit and other developments over the past decade. 
 The authors dismantle the prevailing myths that have made us inclined to tolerate and even encourage narcissism: that it's a function of high self-esteem, that it's a function of low self-esteem, that a little narcissism is healthy, that narcissists are in fact superior, that you have to love yourself to be able to love someone else. 
 Narcissism, according to Twenge and Campbell, is ''a disease that causes others to suffer.'' The symptoms are pernicious. ''Narcissists brag about their achievements (while blaming others for their shortcomings), focus on their physical appearance, value material goods that display status ... constantly turn the conversation back to themselves, manipulate and cheat to get ahead, surround themselves with people who look up to them (like a 'posse' or entourage), seek out 'trophy partners' who make them look good and jump at opportunities to garner attention and fame.'' An ideal personality profile for an ''American Idol'' contestant but probably not for a humanitarian. 
 Not surprisingly, the authors trace the recent rise to a shift in child rearing. Parents instill in their children the conviction that they're ''special''; 223 children born in California in the '90s were named Unique. One preschool in Manhattan designated September ''All About Me Month.'' Some children's sports leagues have stopped keeping score, for fear of hurting the feelings of the losers; others give trophies to everyone, just for being on the team. Parents flatter their children on the well-meaning but misguided grounds that ''praise builds self-esteem, which, in turn, builds success.'' 
 Studies, however, set the record straight: children who think they're special grow up to be adults who expect success -- and the money and fame it brings -- to come quickly and easily, who take offense at the slightest affront to their presumed superiority, who routinely look to be the exception to the rule. 
 The prognosis, Twenge and Campbell tell us, isn't good. They see countertrends like the ''simplicity movement'' but no sign of a widespread backlash. Their prescriptions -- saving rather than spending, practicing gratitude and mindfulness, telling children no, applauding hard work rather than talent or brains -- may not go down easy with the shopaholic candidate for a tummy tuck. But if ever there was a moment when these remedies might stand a chance, the time is now. The authors' recommendation for emphasizing our similarities instead of our differences sounds remarkably like one of the themes on which our new president campaigned. And the prosperity that allows a full-blown sense of entitlement to flourish has collapsed. 
 But justice? Research shows that narcissists aren't as successful in the long run, and their inability to form deep and lasting relationships leaves them marooned on their own islands. But not before they've done significant damage to the people around them. HOLLY BRUBACH

HEADLINE: Angling to Entice the Reluctant Buyer

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
SINCE last fall, Kathy Wallach and two other real estate brokers, Bryan McMillen and Margaret Trautmann, have descended on the Syosset station of the Long Island Rail Road every Tuesday.
 As commuters wait to board trains, the brokers hand out brochures promoting the property of the week along with a comparative market report for the last year. 
 ''We are going face to face, eye to eye, the old-fashioned way,'' said Ms. Wallach, a broker with Daniel Gale Sotheby's International Realty's Locust Valley office who has been selling homes on the North Shore for 16 years. ''Everyone is nervous about the market.'' 
 Since 2006, the number of sales of existing single-family homes has plummeted on Long Island. Sales declined 21.5 percent in Nassau County and 32.1 percent in Suffolk, according to the New York State Association of Realtors.
 During the final months of last year, the median price in Nassau was $425,000, down 10.5 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007. In Suffolk, the median price was $355,000, down 11.2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007, according to data from the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. 
 The news was gloomier last month even as real estate agents said that they are hoping that falling interest rates -- and now falling prices -- will spur some activity in the traditional busier spring market. Last month, sales closed on 461 homes in Nassau, with a median price of $385,000, down 12.5 percent from January 2008. In Suffolk, there were 484 sales, with a median price of $320,000, down 14.3 percent from January 2008. 
 Joseph Mottola, chief executive of the Long Island Board of Realtors and the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, described the market as ''certainly softer than it was a year ago.'' 
 The crisis on Wall Street, Mr. Mottola said, has hastened the drop in values, which had risen nearly 100 percent from 2003 to 2007. He called the current prices ''the inevitable return to the norm.''
 ''There are no ghost towns on Long Island,'' he said, but he acknowledged the slowdown in sales. 
 There are hot spots: sales in West Islip and Elmont rose in the last three months of 2008 compared to the previous year. But generally, the golden rule of real estate still applies, those in the business say: location, location, location. Good schools and access to transportation still make homes easier to sell, real estate officials say.
 Craig Bell, an agent at Prudential Douglas Elliman's Syosset office, said that although volume was down, top school districts like Jericho and Syosset remained ''very much of a draw.'' 
 In good times and bad, real estate officials said, the waterfront is a lure. ''It is not replaceable,'' Mr. Mottola said. 
 Still, even homes on the Great South Bay or Long Island Sound are fetching less than they did a year ago. ''It is not immune,'' Mr. Mottola said. ''But the same house on the water will cost you more than the same house off the water.'' 
 Also beckoning are projects near downtowns and transportation. Because the economy is forcing people to seek smaller homes, apartments and condominiums, smaller properties in these locations are gaining in popularity, said Eric Alexander, executive director of Vision Long Island, a nonprofit planning group. More than 70 projects that include attached town homes, condominiums, downtown apartment buildings and mixed uses are planned, approved, in construction or have been built, he said.
 Tough times also call for new marketing strategies. Frank S. Urso, broker-owner of Long Island Village Realty in Syosset and president of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, said that brokers and agents ''have to adjust to what Gen X and Gen Y buyers are looking for more than they have in the past.''
 With younger buyers using social networking sites to find homes, Mr. Urso said, agents list homes on Facebook and upload house tour videos on YouTube, including aerial searches to show if a house sits in the middle of a block or backs up to railroad tracks, and interactive floor plans.
 ''More marketing dollars are going towards the Internet,'' he said. 
 Brokers are also trying to add what the broker Shawn Elliott called a ''wow factor.'' To top off the gilded appeal of a waterfront Kings Point home, Mr. Elliott, broker-owner of Shawn Elliott Luxury Homes and Estates, said that the $9,995,000 list price included new his and hers cars: a Ferrari convertible and a Maserati coupe. ''It is the turn-on,'' Mr. Elliott said, and is attracting what he called ''the ego market.'' 
 After no one showed up at an open house recently, Stanley Sherwood, whose five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath East Hampton home was listed with Prudential Douglas Elliman in Sag Harbor, came up with a twist. Mr. Sherwood, an international tax lawyer, said he would consider swapping his home, which has a turret and a pool, for a Manhattan condo, co-op or other real estate. 
 ''There are no traditional buyers anymore,'' he said, hoping to find a swapper whose apartment is worth about the same as the $2.2 million listing price for his house.

HEADLINE: 2 Philadelphia Papers File for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The owners of The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Philadelphia Daily News filed for bankruptcy late Sunday night after talks aimed at restructuring their heavy debt load broke down, executives said. 
The papers will continue to operate and will remain under local control, said Brian Tierney, publisher of The Inquirer and the leader of a group of local investors who bought the papers in 2006, one of several newspaper deals from that era that have gone bad as the industry's revenues have plunged.
Philadelphia Newspapers, a subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings, is the entity filed for bankruptcy protection. In a brief interview late on Sunday night, Mr. Tierney said the company would negotiate with its creditors to rework its debt burden.
''Philadelphia Newspapers' goal is to bring its debt in line with the reality of current economic conditions,'' he said.
He signaled that his company's primary aim in bankruptcy would be to seek concessions from the consortium of banks that hold its debt, not from the papers' labor unions. ''This restructuring is focused solely on our debt, not our operations,'' he said.
The company has been negotiating for the better part of a year with the banks, led by Citizens Bank. It had not been in compliance with its debt covenants since mid-2008, and it suspended payment on the debt last fall. Most recently, executives of Philadelphia Media said the original investors offered to put $25 million into the company, but a meeting with the banks on Friday produced no resolution.
The sale of the Philadelphia papers was one of a flurry of deals made in the two years before the recession began, with buyers -- many of whom had no background in the field -- paying prices for newspapers that were called exorbitant even at the time. Revenue for most newspapers has dropped more than 20 percent since then, leaving the new owners struggling with debt.
The Tribune Company, which was taken private in December 2007 by Sam Zell, a real estate mogul, filed for bankruptcy less than a year later. The Minneapolis Star Tribune, bought in late 2006 by Avista Capital Partners, a private equity firm, filed for bankruptcy last month. (The Journal Register Company, which was not part of the buying spree of a few years ago, filed for bankruptcy on Saturday.)
The McClatchy Company bought the Knight Ridder chain in 2006, and has struggled with the debt from that deal. McClatchy quickly sold some of its papers, including those in Philadelphia and Minneapolis.
Mr. Tierney, a public relations executive, and his partners paid $562 million for the papers, including about $412 million in borrowed money. There remains about $390 million in debt.
Executives say that with debt payments suspended, the papers continue to generate cash flow, in part because of significant cost-cutting. One said that last year, they had earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $36 million.
Philadelphia Newspapers is being advised by the investment bank Jeffries. Its bankruptcy lawyers are from Proskauer Rose and Dilworth Paxson.
Over the months of talks with the banks, Philadelphia Media executives have been frustrated by the consortium charging the company for fees paid to the banks' lawyers and consultants, and for interest penalties -- bills that the newspaper group says total $13.4 million. The executives said they had arranged $25 million in debtor-in-possession loans to continue operations.

HEADLINE: Disagreements About Stimulus Embroil G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Republican governors split sharply during the weekend over how to respond to the economic crisis, a debate whose outcome will go a long way toward shaping how the national party redefines itself in the wake of its election defeats of recent years.
The divisions were evident at the annual winter meeting of the National Governors Association here as the Republicans differed both in their approaches to their own states' budget shortfalls and in their attitudes toward President Obama's $787 billion stimulus package.
Some party leaders said Republicans should compromise with the Democratic president and move to the political center to attract independents' votes. A small but vocal group of conservative governors countered that the party instead must rebuild by standing against new spending and taxes to regain the trust of conservative voters.
''There's a tug of war right now within the party as to where we go next,'' Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, one of the conservative Republican leaders, said in an interview. ''I am in the camp that says we go back to basics. There are other folks who say something a little different. The answer will be determined in this tug of war.'' 
Among those tugging opposite him is Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, who only last week concluded a battle to close his state's $42 billion budget deficit over the opposition of Republican state lawmakers who opposed tax increases in the compromise. While Mr. Schwarzenegger was in Washington for the governor's meeting, a petition condemning him circulated back home at the California Republican Party convention.
Those Republicans ''were not in touch with what the majority of people want to do in California,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said Sunday on the ABC program ''This Week.'' ''And the same is nationwide.''
Unfazed by the attacks from Republicans, Mr. Schwarzenegger said he would try again to win health insurance coverage for all Californians, though it would require new taxes.
''Even though it is against your principles or philosophy,'' he said he believed that officeholders should be doing ''what the people want you to do rather than getting stuck in your ideology.''
Most of the Republican governors joined the Democrats in Washington for the annual winter meeting, while several appeared on the Sunday television talk shows. Mr. Obama welcomed the governors for dinner at the White House on Sunday evening and will meet with them on Monday.
The Republican governors' divide reflects their party's erosion to a mostly regional party that is based in the conservative South, after heavy election losses in the Northeast, Midwest and West. And with the party leaderless after losing control of both the White House and Congress in the past two election cycles, the split is colored by early maneuvering for conservatives' support among potential aspirants for the party's 2012 presidential nomination.
Several governors, nearly all of them Southerners known to have national ambitions, have been withering in their criticism of Mr. Obama's stimulus plan, which received only 3 of 219 Republicans' votes in Congress. The harshest critics include Mr. Sanford and Govs. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Haley Barbour of Mississippi, the national chairman of the party in the 1990s, Rick Perry of Texas, and Sarah Palin of Alaska, the party's 2008 vice-presidential nominee.
After initially saying they might reject any federal aid, several conservative governors said in interviews over the weekend that they were likely to reject only the money for expanded unemployment compensation because of federal strings that could require them to provide relief to part-time workers who lose jobs as well as to full-time workers. Many other states already provide such aid.
''Now is the time, and it's a great opportunity for Republican governors and other leaders to offer conservative-based solutions to the problems,'' Mr. Jindal said on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. He announced on Friday that he would reject the $100 million for unemployment compensation in the estimated $4 billion for Louisiana.
Mr. Jindal, the national party's choice to deliver the Republican response to Mr. Obama's address to Congress on Tuesday night, previewed his message, saying: ''We need to work with the president every chance we can. But on principle -- when we disagree with him -- we should be unafraid to stand up on principle and to point out our alternative solutions.''
Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida also appeared on ''Meet the Press'' and immediately rejected Mr. Jindal's approach.
''There is a national leader, his name is President Obama,'' said Mr. Crist, who campaigned for the stimulus package in his state with Mr. Obama.
''I think we do need to be bipartisan,'' he added. ''We need to be, in fact, nonpartisan.''
Mr. Crist took issue with some of the Republican governors' criticism of the unemployment compensation. ''In the past five weeks, I've visited six unemployment offices throughout Florida,'' he said. ''I look into the eyes of these people, and I understand that the challenges are serious that they're having to deal with, and I want to do everything I can to help them.''
In a separate interview, Mr. Crist said, ''I am not here to judge'' the governors who opposed the stimulus bill. But pointing out that he and Mr. Schwarzenegger supported it, he said, ''Maybe it's a result of being from larger states.'' Their two states also supported Mr. Obama last November, while the critics' states did not.
Of the 22 Republican governors, most have not been publicly critical of the stimulus measure. ''I want this president to succeed because I want America to succeed,'' Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana said in an interview. ''There will be plenty of time for alternatives later.''
Four Republicans, including Mr. Crist and Mr. Schwarzenegger, openly supported the Obama plan. The governors' association earlier this month endorsed it in a letter co-signed by its Democratic chairman, Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, and the Republican vice chairman, Gov. Jim Douglas of Vermont. The Southerners led the opposition.
''The last time Republicans made a comeback, it was led by Republican governors,'' Mr. Barbour, of Mississippi, said in an interview, referring to the mid-1990s when Republicans captured control of both chambers of Congress for the first time in 40 years.
''Now we have to take that same approach, take our values and principles,'' he said, and ''tie them to the new issue set that we have to deal with'' amid the recession.
Among those taking something of a Republican middle ground was Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, another potential 2012 prospect. He emphasized in an interview that the party needs to attract women, Hispanics, younger voters and independents to recover.
''The Republican Party is going to have to adhere to its principles, because they are foundational and they are important. But they need to be presented in a hopeful, optimistic, up-tempo, modern, practical way, and that's not what we have been doing recently,'' Mr. Pawlenty said.
''We've become too petty and angry in many aspects,'' he said. ''That's unappealing to swing voters.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Chief Pursues Reversal Of Years of Lax Enforcement

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Less than a month after becoming the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary L. Schapiro is moving swiftly to reverse major decisions by her predecessor and to strengthen an enforcement program that missed several major frauds that cost investors billions of dollars.
Ms. Schapiro and her aides have begun consulting officials at intelligence and law enforcement agencies about the technology they use to sort through mounds of information.
Her hope is to borrow techniques that could help the commission sift through hundreds of thousands of tips it receives annually from informants. Last year, the agency received more than 700,000 such tips.
In one of her first decisions, Ms. Schapiro reversed a policy of her predecessor, Christopher Cox, that had required enforcement lawyers to obtain the consent of commissioners before moving to resolve major cases. With the commission dominated by opponents of government regulation, this had the effect of discouraging cases and reducing penalties. 
''This agency did not pursue some critical issues and problems,'' she said in a brief interview last week. ''We need to be transparent about what we missed. We need to learn from these tragedies.''
The effort to reshape the commission could not be more timely for an agency whose political future is at risk. Congress is preparing to consider legislation this year to overhaul the regulatory structure, a process that threatens to strip the commission of its authority if it does not show progress in restoring its credibility.
Ms. Schapiro, who served as an S.E.C. commissioner previously, has returned to a beleaguered agency thoroughly at odds with the one she had left 15 years earlier.
The commission's failure to uncover major financial problems at the big investment banks, or to detect the Ponzi scheme that Bernard L. Madoff has told prosecutors he operated for years, has led to withering criticism from Congress and former S.E.C. chairmen from both parties.
Demoralized staff members had been watering down proposed settlements in enforcement cases out of fear that the commission would reject them. Commission examiners, under harsh criticism for missing major scandals, have been fearful of taking risks or proposing changes in oversight.
Investor groups had been frozen out by an agency that had been dominated by commissioners describing themselves as proponents of free-market principles, who made it more difficult for the professional staff to bring cases. Senior jobs lay vacant for many months. Many problems at the largest investment houses had gone undetected, and telltale signs of possible fraud at Bernard L. Madoff Securities and at the Stanford Group, which was accused last week of being involved in an $8 billion investor fraud, were ignored.
The once-proud agency was so dysfunctional that it had no way of distinguishing the meritless from the significant among the more than 700,000 whistle-blower and investor complaints it receives each year.
''When I left here 15 years ago, it was a much simpler world,'' Ms. Schapiro said. ''The commission was riding very high. Now I worry, how do we get back our high level of confidence?''
Other former senior officials at the commission gave her high marks for her first weeks in office.
''In a very short period of time she's begun restoring the muscle and morale of the commission,'' said Arthur Levitt Jr., who headed the commission during the Clinton administration and became its longest serving chairman. Speaking of Congressional efforts to overhaul the agency, he added, ''I expect she will define a plan for the agency before it is defined for her.''
Ms. Schapiro has moved quickly to embrace some officials and investor groups that had been pushed out or marginalized by Mr. Cox, a former Republican Congressman. While he had taken many months to fill key positions, she has taken just days to replace the agency's general counsel and enforcement chief.
She has appointed Kayla J. Gillan to a top position and given her a large portfolio of issues. Ms. Gillan, a long-term ally of investor groups and former general counsel of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, left the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board a year ago after a public feud with Mr. Cox. Her agenda now includes leading a new investor advisory council and working on proposals to give shareholders greater voice in governance issues like choosing corporate directors and executive pay.
Ms. Schapiro has also been trying to find a prominent role for Charles D. Niemeier, whose term at the accounting oversight board is expiring. Mr. Niemeier was an outspoken critic of Mr. Cox's effort to allow American companies to adopt international accounting standards, a change that he and other experts say would lead to watering down many of the current rules in use in the United States.
Her other top aides include Stephen L. Cohen, a former enforcement official who has been involved in significant fraud cases. Robert Khuzami, a former federal prosecutor who led a securities and commodities law task force in the Manhattan United States attorney's office for three years, was named last Friday to become the new head of the enforcement division, succeeding Linda Thomsen.
At the Republican Convention in 2004, Mr. Khuzami spoke in favor of the nomination of George W. Bush. Mr. Levitt, the former chairman of the S.E.C. and a Democrat, said his selection by Ms. Schapiro speaks volumes about her political courage.
''The commission, since it was formed, was always known as nonpartisan and free of interference from the White House,'' Mr. Levitt said. ''In recent years that changed. They had ideologues. What Mary did in appointing a Republican who spoke for George Bush was an act of political courage that the commission hasn't seen in many years.''
Ms. Schapiro recruited David M. Becker, a widely respected former general counsel at the agency under Mr. Levitt and Harvey L. Pitt, to return to the agency in an expanded version of his old job.
An early test of Ms. Schapiro's effectiveness could come this week, when the White House announces its proposed budget for the entire government, including the regulatory agencies. The administration is under pressure to find places to make budget cuts even though President Obama and his senior aides have blamed the economic crisis in part on the inadequate financing for regulatory efforts.
In the meantime, Ms. Schapiro has outlined an ambitious agenda for the coming weeks. She says she will work quickly to adopt rules to minimize the conflicts of interest at credit-rating agencies that many experts say contributed to the current crisis. She is exploring whether to impose restrictions on short-selling, a type of trade in which an investor profits on stock declines. One idea she is considering is the revival of the uptick rule, a regulation that prohibited short-selling while a stock is declining.
She has committed to moving quickly to let shareholders have more say in executive compensation and board elections. Other chairmen throughout the years had sought the adoption of similar proposals, only to be blocked by powerful corporate interests. She is studying proposals for greater disclosures of the qualifications of board members, particularly those involved in assessing risks and setting executive compensation.
Ms. Schapiro, 53, has spent her professional life working as a Wall Street regulator. She began her career as a counsel to the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. She was first appointed a commissioner at the S.E.C. in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan. She was reappointed by President George H. W. Bush and left when President Bill Clinton selected her to be the chairwoman of the C.F.T.C., a job she held until 1996.
Her most recent job before rejoining the government was as head of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees Wall Street regulation on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Ms. Schapiro acknowledges that it will take time to restore the S.E.C.'s credibility.
''I recognize that we could all be defined by what we missed rather than what we find,'' she said. ''That's why I'm intensely impatient about addressing these issues.''

HEADLINE: As Doubts Grow, U.S. Will Judge Banks' Stability

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Louise Story and Eric Dash contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration will begin taking a hard look at the financial condition of the country's 20 biggest banks this week to judge whether they could hold up even if the downturn worsens further than policy makers already expect.
These reviews of the banks' books, known as ''stress tests,'' are heightening a dilemma for Obama aides about how candid they should be about the health of banks like Citigroup and Bank of America. The tests are expected to take several weeks.
Bank shares were pummeled last week, partly because of rumors that the government might nationalize some of the banks. Officials consider many of the top 20 banks ''too big to fail.''
On Monday, the administration reiterated in a statement that it thought banks should remain private but also offered some reassurance that it would support the banks as needed. 
''The government will ensure that banks have the capital and liquidity they need to provide the credit necessary to restore economic growth,'' the government said. ''Moreover, we reiterate our determination to preserve the viability of systemically important financial institutions so that they are able to meet their commitments.''
In the statement, the government said that any investment would be in the form of preferred shares that would be converted into common shares and sold as financial conditions improve.
The stress tests come as anxiety is building among investors and industry analysts about the Treasury Department's broader plan to shore up the banking system. People familiar with the plan, which has been criticized by executives and analysts as vague, say its crucial details may not be ready for another few weeks.
In yet another sign of distress for the banks, Citigroup officials were in active talks with federal regulators on Sunday night about plans for the government to take a bigger ownership stake in the bank, according to a person close to the talks.
Citigroup approached the regulators with a plan that would allow them to convert a large amount of the government's $45 billion of preferred shares, which is treated as debt, into common stock, this person said. The government owns a stake of roughly 8 percent, but that could grow to as much as 40 percent.
Converting the preferred shares while also issuing more common shares would bring Citigroup closer to the mix of equity that the government is likely to demand when it introduces the stress test. But that would severely dilute the value of shares held by existing Citigroup stockholders.
Still, the big banks say they remain relatively healthy and that, with time and support from the government, they will regain their footing.
But many economists, Wall Street analysts and even some bank executives contend that some of the banks are already effectively insolvent.
Even though banks have reported billions of dollars of losses from bad loans, these critics say, the major institutions still carry trillions of dollars in additional toxic assets and are too damaged to resume normal lending.
This camp says it would be best to nationalize some of them now -- with the government wiping out shareholders and taking over the operation of some institutions, at least temporarily -- rather than to drag out the process while the economy spirals further downward.
The stress tests will use computer-run ''what if'' situations to estimate what would happen to each bank under Depression-like conditions, with unemployment surging to 10 or 12 percent, for example, or home prices dropping 20 percent further, Treasury and Federal Reserve officials said.
Fed officials emphasized that these hypothetical events were ''highly unlikely'' to occur.
Top advisers to President Obama, including the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, have insisted repeatedly that they want to keep the major banks in ''private hands'' and have no intention of nationalizing them. But because the tests involve nightmarish economic conditions, the results of the tests are likely to strengthen the case that some of the major banks need more capital. That would increase the likelihood that the government would increase its stake and dilute or even wipe out the shares held by private investors.
On Friday, Treasury and Fed officials put out the message that the stress tests themselves should not be seen as cause for anxiety. The tests, officials said, would simply make clearer whether a particular bank needs more capital now or might need more in the future if conditions become worse.
Their implication was that federal regulators were not about to impose strict numerical rules to decide whether a bank had ''passed'' or ''failed'' the stress test. Federal officials are not expected to publicly disclose the findings about any specific bank, though they are expected to provide at least a rough idea of the new questions they are asking.
Some officials argued that the tests might actually provide reassurance about the strength of many banks. Indeed, Treasury and Fed officials said they had consulted with industry executives in devising the tests.
Bank executives reached over the weekend said that the tests might not produce information that is very different from what regulators already know about the banks. The Federal Reserve already has hundreds of examiners on site at the largest banks, monitoring their businesses.
Meanwhile, the revelation that details of the Treasury's new bank rescue plan might not come for several weeks leaves banks and their shareholders to stew.
''These stress tests are just going to raise more questions and add to the uncertainty,'' said Bert Ely, a banking analyst in Alexandria, Va. ''The only thing that is likely to calm them down is if the administration flatly declares that it won't take over banks.''
Administration officials have tried to make that point, but they have stopped short of making absolute declarations -- probably because many industry analysts say some banks that are ''too big to fail'' may well be too feeble to stand on their own.
President Obama's chief spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said on Friday that the administration ''continues to strongly believe'' that a privately held banking system was ''the correct way to go.''
But on Friday, and for much of last week, investors acted as if they were betting on government takeovers and dumping bank shares in response. Shares in Citigroup, for example, fell 44 percent, and Bank of America stock dropped 32 percent.
Indeed, investors appeared to be challenging government assertions in exactly the same way they did last summer, when they called the Bush administration's bluff about the financial needs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage-finance companies, which eventually had to be taken over.
Because a complete government takeover could wipe out or at least dilute the value of existing common shares, investors sold bank shares at a furious pace last week.
Rumors about a government takeover of one or more major banks accelerated sharply last week after Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, said on Wednesday that the government might be forced to temporarily nationalize some banks.
When Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, alluded to Mr. Greenspan's remarks and reluctantly endorsed them in an interview on Friday, investors hammered bank shares once again.

HEADLINE: It's a 'Slumdog' Kind of Night at the Oscar Ceremony

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY and DAVID CARR. 
Brooks Barnes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- ''Slumdog Millionaire'' and its director, Danny Boyle, with their modern-day fairy tale about hope and hard times in the slums of Mumbai, pushed aside big-studio contenders to sweep top honors at the 81st annual Academy Awards on Sunday.
Accepting the best director award, Mr. Boyle paid tribute to the people of Mumbai, who figured by the thousands in his film. ''You dwarf even this guy,'' he said, looking at his Oscar statuette. Minutes later, ''Slumdog Millionaire'' was named best picture, helping give the evening a distinctly international tilt.
Mr. Boyle, 52, has been known for putting an inspirational twist on often dark and sophisticated movies that have included ''Trainspotting,'' about heroin addiction, and ''Sunshine,'' about sacrifice on a mission to reignite the sun. 
The many prizes for ''Slumdog Millionaire'' -- whose writer, Simon Beaufoy, was honored for best adapted screenplay, among others prizes for the film -- completed the film's steady march past competitors like ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'' from Paramount Pictures and ''Frost/Nixon'' from Universal Pictures.
The best picture award was a first for Fox Searchlight, which distributed ''Slumdog Millionaire'' in the United States. In the past, the studio appeared to narrowly miss the big prize with a series of comic best picture nominees that included ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' ''Sideways'' and ''The Full Monty.''
In what was widely perceived to be one of the year's few tight races, Sean Penn was named best actor for his performance in the title role in ''Milk.''
''You Commie, homo-loving sons of guns,'' said Mr. Penn, who edged aside Brad Pitt and Mickey Rourke, among others, for the best actor Oscar, his second.
Best actress honors went to Kate Winslet for her performance in ''The Reader'' as a German woman who becomes romantically involved with a teenager and later conceals her role in the Holocaust.
Hollywood has been taking on more and more of a global tilt with each passing year, but on this evening it was especially evident in the show and in the awards themselves.
After Penelope Cruz won for best supporting actress for her role in ''Vicky Cristina Barcelona,'' she gave part of her speech in Spanish -- she said backstage it was a dedication to the actors and people of Spain -- and then suggested backstage that the movies had to grow beyond the bounds of strictly American stories. ''We are all mixed together, and it has to be reflected in the cinema,'' she said.
The supporting actress award, the night's first, was presented by no less than five past winners of the prize, Whoopi Goldberg, Tilda Swinton, Eva Marie Saint, Goldie Hawn and Anjelica Huston. The heavy show of star power was meant to make good on a promise that the broadcast would deliver entertainment value that reached far beyond that offered by the nominees.
Heath Ledger, in a widely anticipated development, posthumously won the best supporting actor prize for his performance as the Joker in ''The Dark Knight.'' Mr. Ledger's parents afterward said his Oscar statuette would be held in trust by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Many other awards also went to those favored in the preshow betting.
Dustin Lance Black won the best original screenplay Oscar for ''Milk,'' about the gay-rights advocate Harvey Milk. Mr. Black, who is openly gay, said Mr. Milk's story had given him hope that one day he might ''fall in love and even get married.''
Mr. Beaufoy, whose ''Slumdog'' screenplay was based on a novel by Vikas Swarup, rattled off a list of places he never expected to be -- ''the moon, the South Pole, the Miss World podium and here'' -- as he accepted that award for his work on a film that captured many of the movie industry's pre-Oscar honors and was widely viewed as a preordained winner of the evening's final award, for best picture.
Also in the first wave of awards, ''Wall-E'' was named best animated film, though it had been denied the best picture nomination that its backers at the Walt Disney Company and its Pixar Animation unit had sought.
Overall, Sunday evening's Oscar show became a struggle between the ambitions of a producing team -- headed by the veteran film producer Laurence Mark and the filmmaker Bill Condon -- that aimed for an evening full of surprises and the apparent determination of 5,810 voters in the academy to bestow honors largely where they were expected to go.
A much-discussed new format for the show opened with a loosey-goosey showbiz number and proceeded along very self-referential lines, with lots of inside jokes that drew substantial laughs from the crowd inside the Kodak Theater here.
Hugh Jackman, the evening's host, started with a very short comic monologue that poked fun at his own failure to get nominated for his performance in ''Australia.'' He then plunged into a comic song-and-dance number that poked fun at serious movies that were nominated for best picture, including ''Milk'' and ''Frost/Nixon,'' and less serious movies that were not, including ''The Dark Knight.''
An early appearance by the screenwriting winners helped give the evening a story line of its own: the awards categories were arranged in blocks intended to reflect the process of building a film, beginning, in the first segment, with a blinking cursor tapping out the beginning of a script on a blank screen.
In another departure, the celebrity presenters were not identified in advance, partly in the hope that a larger-than-usual audience would tune in to see who actually showed up.
Last year's broadcast, with the smallest domestic audience in the ceremony's history, had only about 32 million viewers in the United States.
The show's stage sets, overseen by the New York architect David Rockwell, were bathed much of the time in blue and included a vast crystal curtain. And the show was punctuated by deliberate references to movies that had played well with ticket-buying audiences last year but were often not in the running for awards, the nominations for which went overwhelmingly to relatively little-seen movies.
To some extent, the show's elements collided with themselves, as songs, cinematic retrospectives and actor after actor working Hollywood in-jokes crowded the screen. One sequence, directed by Bennett Miller, of ''Capote,'' was squeezed out altogether but was shown to the in-theater audience during a commercial break.
In keeping with the self-referential tone of the night, the best live action short was teed up with a live action short from Judd Apatow, with Seth Rogen and James Franco, in character from their ''Pineapple Express'' film, in starring roles.
''This is almost a surreal moment to me,'' said the German filmmaker Jochen Alexander Freydank as he accepted the award for his ''Spielzeugland,'' which had not much to do with the antics that preceded it.
A reconfigured auditorium made it much easier for the celebrities to mingle during commercial breaks. The mood was lively and chaotic. Mr. Rourke sat on the edge of the stage kicking his legs during several breaks, with a stage manager coming to shoo him back to his seat.
Mr. Jackman came across less as comic than as cabaret performer. Along the way, he did his best to try to keep the troops entertained during the commercial breaks, serenading his dad in the audience, reading a note from his wife (''you're doing good so far, babe'') and even going into the aisles to hand out cookies.
Still, all the showmanship seemed only to highlight the basic challenge of a ceremony whose producers were hoping to capitalize on movies' strong commercial appeal: The best picture candidates -- ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,'' ''Frost/Nixon,'' ''Milk,'' ''The Reader'' and ''Slumdog Millionaire'' -- altogether had fewer than half the viewers of ''The Dark Knight,'' an audience favorite that was praised by many critics but still did not make the cut.
In the end, ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,'' which had been the evening's most-nominated film, with 13 nominations in all, won for its art direction and makeup but not in the crucial acting and directing categories. ''Frost/Nixon,'' directed by Ron Howard, was the only best picture nominee to come away with no prizes at all.
''Slumdog Millionaire,'' though it had no actors nominated for prizes, swept many awards other than those on the top line, including prizes for cinematography, sound mixing, score and film editing. ''Slumdog's'' eight Oscars was the largest total won by a single film since ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' won 11 in 2004.
Hopes of using the evening to celebrate the enduring popularity of films were complicated by the grim economic realities of the moment. The academy has been trying to celebrate a year in which movie attendance remained buoyant without looking as if the industry is out of touch with the misery elsewhere.
Walking in among the stars who lined the red carpet, Harvey Weinstein, a founder of the Weinstein Company, said a bit of glamour was needed to help ''overcome the malaise'' that hung over matters more real. ''If we and the movies don't create an illusion, we've failed,'' said Mr. Weinstein, whose company released ''The Reader.''
Phillipe Petit, the French tightrope walker from ''Man on Wire'' -- which won for best documentary feature -- walked into the ceremony on the carpet and said, ''I haven't been looking at the red carpet, I've been looking above and thinking of what it would be like to be on a wire above all this.''
In one of the night's few surprises, the best foreign language film went to ''Departures,'' a drama about an unemployed cellist, from Japan. Many observers had predicted ''Waltz With Bashir,'' an Israeli animated drama about that country's past war in Lebanon, would take that prize.
In addition, the standard ''In Memoriam'' segment took on special significance this year because one of the nominees for best supporting actor, Mr. Ledger, died unexpectedly of a drug overdose early last year, before ''Dark Knight'' was even released. Queen Latifah sang a familiar ballad, ''I'll Be Seeing You,'' from the Broadway musical ''Right This Way,'' during the memorial segment.
The glittering event at the Kodak is generally a pretty grown-up affair, but this year children from halfway around the world made a splashy appearance. The kids from ''Slumdog Millionaire'' had no trouble adjusting to the head-snapping cultural shift from India to the red carpet.
''I want to see Johnny Depp, Robert De Niro, and Jack Nicholson, Robert Downey,'' said Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, who played the young Salim in the film. ''Seeing any of them would be cool.''
He was surrounded by seven co-stars who played the main characters at various ages. When asked how they felt about their film being among the nominated, they all backed up as if on cue and shouted, ''Jai ho,'' which translates roughly as ''Victory.''
Another child from India was Pinki Sonkar, whose cleft palate repair was the story behind ''Smile Pinki,'' which won the documentary short film category.
Jerry Lewis, the 82-year-old comedian who has devoted much of his time to raising money for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award from Eddie Murphy, who had reprised one of Mr. Lewis's most famous roles, ''The Nutty Professor.''
''The humility I feel will stay with me for the rest of my life,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''To all of you people from the movie business, it is such a joy being part of you and of everything you do.''
Online Correction: February 24, 2009, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about the Academy Awards ceremony misstated part of a comment by Danny Boyle, director of ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' in some editions. Mr. Boyle, saluting the people of Mumbai, where the film is set, said, ''You dwarf even this guy,'' referring to the Oscar statuette -- not ''You dwarf even the sky.''

HEADLINE: Bosnia Unraveling

 BODY:
It has been a long time since the United States paid serious high-level attention to Bosnia. After the 1995 Dayton Accords ended the genocidal horrors, Washington moved on to other priorities and largely left oversight of the peace agreement to Europe. Now it's time to seriously re-engage before the deal unravels. 
 Fortunately, an immediate return to widespread violence seems unlikely. But Dennis Blair, the new director of national intelligence, warned Congress recently that Bosnia's survival as a multi-ethnic state is seriously in doubt, with tensions at their highest levels in years. The deal that ended the war created a decentralized political system that has entrenched rather than eradicated deep divisions. Bosnia's political leaders continue to prey on their countrymen's ethnic prejudices and insecurities. Haris Silajdzic -- the Muslim in Bosnia's three-member presidency -- has called for the Serbian Republic inside of Bosnia to be abolished. The Bosnian Serb prime minister, Milorad Dodik, who is supported by Russia, has talked about secession.
 Bosnia's people ultimately must take responsibility for what their country is to become. But the United States, which led the Dayton negotiations, has a vested interest in making sure the peace deal does not erode further. So does the European Union, which has 2,000 peacekeepers and a special representative in Bosnia.
 The United States and its allies must craft a plan to salvage Dayton's promise. It can use the lure of eventual E.U. membership to get Bosnians to write a new constitution that will finally create a functioning multi-ethnic state. We are reassured that President Obama's aides are beginning to discuss Bosnia. The new president's commitment to aggressive diplomacy could help ensure that Bosnia's horrors are never seen again.

HEADLINE: Many Specialists at Private Universities Earn More Than Presidents

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
While generous compensation packages for college presidents have come under increasing public scrutiny, other university employees often earn far more. 
 In fact, of the 88 private-college employees who made $1 million or more in the 2007 fiscal year, only 11 were chief executives, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education's analysis of compensation packages of more than 4,000 employees at nearly 600 private colleges. 
 The top two earners were a football coach at the University of Southern California and a Columbia University dermatology professor, each of whom received more than $4 million. 
 Pete Carroll, the head football coach at U.S.C., received $4,415,714 in 2007, about four times as much as the president of the university, Steven B. Sample. Dr. David N. Silvers, the Columbia dermatologist, received $4,332,759, compared with $1,411,894 for Lee C. Bollinger, the president of the university. And he was not the only Columbia employee who out-earned the president: Dr. Jeffrey W. Moses, a professor of medicine, received $2,532,713. 
 ''There are a lot of different spheres of influence throughout a university,'' said Jeff Selingo, editor of The Chronicle, ''and since medical schools and some specialties within them generate so much revenue, it's not surprising that compensation reflects that.''
 Mr. Selingo added: ''Chief financial officers are highly paid because they are generally people who could get a job at a Fortune 500 company. What's actually most interesting to me is that chief academic officers are getting so much. I think what's happening is that they're becoming the ones running the university day to day, as presidents are increasingly away from campus, talking to donors or traveling overseas to set up partnerships.'' 
 The Chronicle's data, which is taken from the Internal Revenue Service's Form 990, do not include executives at public universities, who do not file that form. The figures, the most recent available, are from the tax filing for the 2006-7 fiscal year. 
 The pay for university presidents has risen sharply over the last decade -- as has the gap between their pay and that of the average professor. At private colleges, The Chronicle found in its annual compensation survey, the average president's salary is about $500,000.
 Shortly after The Chronicle's survey of presidential compensation was released in November, amid the nation's financial meltdown, many public figures criticized the high pay, and a few presidents voluntarily gave back a portion of it. 
 ''When you have college presidents making $1 million, you're going to have $800,000 provosts and $500,000 deans,'' said Patrick M. Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education. ''It may be reasonable for these people to be well paid, but if faculty's getting 2 percent raises, I don't see why senior administrators who are already high-paid should get much larger increases. It reflects a set of values that is not the way most Americans think of higher education.'' 
 David L. Warren, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, issued a statement on Friday noting that highly paid university employees are the exception, not the rule. The median compensation for all employees in the Chronicle survey is $160,493, he said, significantly less than comparably skilled and experienced professionals would earn outside of universities. The new Chronicle analysis of pay data listed the 10 highest-paid employees other than chief executives, the 10 highest- paid financial officers and the 10 highest-paid academic officers. Only Emory University and Vanderbilt University were represented on all three lists. 
 Vanderbilt had two of the highest-paid employees on the top 10 list: Dr. Harry R. Jacobson, the vice chancellor for health affairs, and Norman B. Urmy, the former executive vice president for clinical affairs, who stepped down in June 2006. Each had a pay package worth more than $2.4 million.
 Vanderbilt also had the highest-paid academic officer, Nicholas S. Zeppos, who earned $1,046,751, and the second-highest-paid financial officer, Lauren Brisky, who earned $1,159,197 and is retired as of this month. 
 In 2007, The Chronicle has reported, Vanderbilt also had the highest-paid university chief in the nation -- E. Gordon Gee, who forfeited about half of his $2 million compensation package when he left to become president of Ohio State University. 
 Mr. Zeppos then succeeded him as chancellor of Vanderbilt last March. 
 The executive vice president for health affairs at Emory, Dr. Michael M. E. Johns, received $3,753,067, The Chronicle found, while the chief financial officer, Michael J. Mandl, received $666,300, and the chief academic officer, Earl Lewis, received $536,540. 
 The compensation figures include deferred compensation, some of which is subject to forfeiture. 
 Generally, fertility doctors are among the highest paid. 
 At Cornell, Dr. Zev Rosenwaks of the Center for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility received $3,149,376, and at New York University, Dr. James A. Grifo, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology, was paid $2,393,646. Both substantially out-earned their presidents.

HEADLINE: After Reversal of Fortunes, City Takes a New Look at Wall Street

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
In the weeks after the Lehman Brothers investment bank collapsed last fall, Robert C. Lieber, the deputy mayor for economic development, was predicting that Wall Street would confound doomsayers by bouncing back faster than expected and reaffirm New York as the financial capital of the world.
 Last week, Mr. Lieber and his colleagues at City Hall sounded a very different tune: most of the financial jobs lost in this crisis, they predicted, would not be regained in the next several years -- if ever. 
 ''We're not looking to recreate what was here before,'' Mr. Lieber said. ''We're acknowledging the changes and looking to diversify within financial services and outside financial services.''
 That admission, as much as any other, highlights just how significantly the thinking about Wall Street has changed in a matter of months.
 Early last year, city officials were still fretting about the rise of London's financial industry and the competitive threat it posed to New York. Now they are worried about filling a huge hole in the city's economy while trying to retain thousands of laid-off financiers before they scatter across the globe.
 They now forecast that the financial services sector that powered the city's prosperity will shed 65,000 jobs as a result of the financial crisis. Almost half of them will come from the highest-paying pursuits like investment banking and the sales and trading of stocks and bonds, according to an analysis the city commissioned from the Boston Consulting Group.
 The study concluded that what remained of the sector would be far less profitable than it was. In 2007, its $70 billion profit amounted to about 22 percent of its revenue, the study found. But it concluded that that profit margin could decline by half or even three-quarters before it started to grow again. The speed and depth of the reversal of Wall Street's fortunes have shaken the faith of city officials in the staying power of the biggest corporate employers and driven a rapid overhaul of their economic development policies. No longer can they count on the financial sector to supply one-third or more of all the compensation paid out in the city, as it did in 2007, or to fill the coffers of the city and state governments with tax revenue.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's news conference last week in a converted warehouse near the Holland Tunnel revealed a stark turnabout in his administration's approach.
 It had been only four years since Mr. Bloomberg piled up more than $100 million in incentives to persuade Goldman Sachs, one of the world's most profitable companies, to build a 43-story headquarters near the site of the destroyed World Trade Center. That building, still under construction, was designed to have hangar-size spaces where hundreds of traders could buy and sell all sorts of high-risk securities. Trading floors like those were supposed to help set New York apart from its rivals.
 But last week, Mr. Bloomberg laid out a very different vision of the city's future. Standing in a large, empty space a mile north of the financial district, he pinned hopes for a financial revival on businesses of a different scale: start-ups conceived and managed by the defrocked wizards of Wall Street.
 Rather than write them off as losers in the casinos of capitalism, city officials are encouraging them to start over, the Silicon Valley way. As part of a $45 million program, the city will subsidize garage-size offices as hatcheries for their most promising ideas for new businesses in finance or other fields.
 ''This represents a fundamental shift in public policy,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, a group that represents the interests of big corporations. That shift, she said, accelerated rapidly last fall as it became clear that the big firms that had been the pillars of economic growth would be shrinking and recasting themselves for years to come.
 ''When the financial crisis started to hit and we began to get the first information about the potential losses of jobs and revenue, I think that made the conversation about how does the industry change,'' Ms. Wylde said. ''One of the things we were interested in changing was the global image of New York as a center that welcomes entrepreneurs and that we won't cede that position to Beijing or London or M.I.T.,'' she said, referring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 Or Chicago. One new focus of city officials' attention is maintaining and developing financial exchanges and other infrastructure for the sector. Among the current concerns is catching up to the Chicago Climate Exchange, which is trying to establish itself as the hub for the trading of greenhouse gas emission credits. The New York Mercantile Exchange started trading a few environmental securities last year as a prelude to what it calls the Green Exchange.
 The Green Exchange employs only a few people so far and all of the trading on it is expected to be conducted electronically, said a spokesman for CME Group, which owns it. But city officials are more interested in the cachet and magnetism of being the home of what could be the next big thing in trading and finance.
 That is why Mr. Bloomberg introduced Barry E. Silbert at a news conference last week. Mr. Silbert, a former investment banker, is the founder and chief executive of SecondMarket, a five-year-old company that creates markets for trading of obscure securities and assets, including claims against Lehman Brothers in bankruptcy court.
 Mr. Silbert's company may never replace more than a handful of the tens of thousands of jobs lost in this downturn, but his attitude about the possibilities is what city officials want to capture and spread.
 ''Why start a company here?'' Mr. Silbert said. ''Aside from the robust infrastructure, entrepreneurs come to New York for its most abundant resource: smart, ambitious, innovative people.
 ''The next chapter in the history of Wall Street is being written right now,'' he said. ''Never has there been a need for such a cultural and intellectual shift in thinking on Wall Street.''

HEADLINE: In a Transformed City, Falling In and Out of Grace

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
The glazed, slightly crazed smile of Ted Haggard, the leader of a megachurch in Colorado who was ousted in a jiffy after a sex and drugs scandal, makes a cameo appearance in ''This Beautiful City,'' the latest work of cultural anthropology from the Civilians, which opened Sunday night at the Vineyard Theater. But Pastor Ted's supersize fall from grace is a story no stranger than many others in this engaging, inquisitive and evenhanded work of theater about the transformation of an American city and many American lives.
 The burg of the title is Colorado Springs, just at the foot of Pikes Peak, home both to Mr. Haggard's former empire, the New Life Church, with thousands of members, and Focus on the Family, the conservative organization run by James Dobson that has been a leader of the charge against gay rights initiatives for years. The Civilians, a troupe of theater artists who construct much of their work from interviews, spent 10 weeks in the city before and after the Haggard scandal broke, collecting impressions from citizens ranging across the social and religious spectrum, from church leaders to embattled atheists in full bunker mode. 
 You might assume that members of a hip New York theater company would descend on the country's epicenter of evangelism like a swarm of junior Michael Moores, wielding tape recorders like rapiers, backpacks stuffed full of snark. But the Civilians, known for the long-running revue ''Gone Missing'' and other documentary shows, have generally used humor to illuminate our follies rather than to sneer at our frailties. And that is certainly the case in ''This Beautiful City,'' which presents its collage of human experience without commentary, with a loose focus on the clash between religious orthodoxy and freedom of sexual expression.
 Written by Steven Cosson and Jim Lewis, with songs by Michael Friedman, the show features a talented cast of six playing several roles each. Through the voices of the city's people the gradual transformation of Colorado Springs into a miniature capital of Christianity is traced. 
 ''The way my mom tells it,'' the founder of an alternative paper says, ''before all the evangelicals moved in, Colorado Springs was very live and let live. But what happened was, in the '80s this city brought in evangelical nonprofits to jump-start the economy.'' 
 The population growth and cultural evolution that followed are lamented by secularists who resent the increasing power wielded by the churches, and celebrated by the Christians who believe it is their mission to create a new paradise on earth. ''It's about turning things around in a troubled city using strategic prayer,'' an associate pastor at the New Life Church asserts. ''Just using the power of prayer you can see measurable outcomes like better jobs, fewer divorces, less crime.'' And free Starbucks! (That's a perk for those who attend the church's youth-group activities.) 
 Troubling questions about the blurring of the line between religion and government are raised -- one passage touches on the incursion of evangelism into the Air Force Academy, also located in Colorado Springs -- but sociology generally takes a back seat to personal history. The show's strongest passages are those in which individual voices are the focus, as the city's residents reveal how they have navigated an increasingly polarized culture. 
 One of the most moving testimonials comes from Ben Reynolds (Marsha Stephanie Blake), the pastor of a mostly African-American church who is inspired to come out as a gay man before his congregation. His decision is prompted by the heated conflict surrounding two state ballot initiatives, one supporting rights for gay couples and another banning gay marriage. (No prizes for guessing how that shook out, even if you don't happen to be up on your Colorado legislative history.)
 Emily Ackerman is terrific in a couple of memorable roles. She plays a Christian woman whose gay father essentially abandoned her when she was in her teens. She married at 17, fell into drugs shortly after and was ''doing coke with a bunch of strippers'' one Saturday night, only to wake the next morning to hear ''God calling to me.'' Ms. Ackerman also provides a wry portrait of a transgendered Christian who recalls with a drawl her feeling of being exiled from both the church and the city itself, which she nevertheless insists on loving for its beauty. 
 Mr. Friedman, the Civilians' house songwriter, is a skilled composer of pop pastiche. Here he channels blandly upbeat Christian rock and country music effectively, but for the most part the songs are transcribed speech set to appealing but uncomplicated melodies. Mr. Friedman may have felt constrained by the show's aspirations to objectivity, and as a result tried to keep from imposing his own personality on the songs; the result is a score without much character. 
 An exception is a funny ditty called ''Whatever,'' performed by Ms. Blake in the role of a teenage girl who chatters about the difficulty of not being a true believer, but feels drawn to the New Life youth get-togethers anyway. ''It's like going to a concert,'' she sings. ''Sometimes I'll find myself singing along, and then I think about the words. And it's just so awkward. I mean, whatever.'' Also amusing is the e-mail message from Haggard, prescandal, set to a perky little tune, in which he crows about his globe-trotting and hobnobbing with politicos. 
 As directed by Mr. Cosson ''This Beautiful City'' is perhaps too inclusive and loosely structured. But the Haggard scandal naturally provides a bit of narrative spine. Among the roles performed by the boyish, apple-cheeked Stephen Plunkett is Marcus Haggard, one of Ted's sons. Although he grew up in the eye of the evangelical storm, Marcus's reaction to the downfall of his father is moving in its maturity and complexity. 
 ''Sure, tragedy happened there,'' he reflects. ''Flip side is, in my view, my dad's understanding God for the first time. Because, you know, we believe God is unconditional love. He is the only one who can love us completely for who we are, no matter what we've done, and heal us. So I think my dad's being healed. I think he's closer to being human now than ever before.''

HEADLINE: Explaining 'No' Vote On Stimulus In Michigan

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: LIVONIA, Mich. 

 BODY:
Connie from Livonia was on the line with Representative Thaddeus McCotter during a telephone town-hall-style meeting, sounding worried as the auto industry continued to spiral down, taking Michigan's economy along for the ride.
 Her husband was laid off from American Axle and Manufacturing, one of the many suppliers cutting back because of the rapidly shrinking demand for parts. Her sons who had served in the military could not find work and were ineligible for veterans health care. 
 Since Mr. McCotter had opposed the economic stimulus program, just what was his plan, she asked, to deal with the increasingly dire situation that she and thousands of other McCotter constituents find themselves in? 
 Mr. McCotter, a junior member of the House Republican leadership, ticked off some alternatives offered by Republicans and stuck to his position that the $787 billion stimulus package presented an unacceptable trade of minimal near-term benefits for future fiscal disaster. 
 ''It won't work,'' said Mr. McCotter, 43, who worked his way up from local elected office. ''If I thought it would work, I would have voted for it.''
 Now Mr. McCotter -- whose suburban district west of Detroit is laced with unemployed autoworkers, shuttered automotive plants and struggling manufacturers -- could become a test case of whether House Republicans' united front against the economic measure was the wise political and policy course.
 Democrats are mounting a new campaign to remind voters that Mr. McCotter and 11 other Republicans in competitive districts in harder-hit states opposed the stimulus package, which the president says will provide middle class tax cuts and millions of jobs -- 7,800 in Mr. McCotter's district alone, according to a calculation by the White House.
 ''Did you know Congressman Thad McCotter voted against President Obama's economic recovery plan, endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce?'' says the script of an automated telephone call that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee plans to direct to homes in his district this week. The message will encourage voters to call Mr. McCotter and ''ask why he voted to raise taxes on middle-class families.''
 In an interview, Mr. McCotter said his constituents understood that the legislation, which increased unemployment benefits and subsidized health insurance for laid-off workers, could not fix the state's structural economic problems. He said they joined him in suspecting that significant amounts of the money would be wasted.
 ''The people who really like the stimulus are the elected officials who will handle the money,'' said Mr. McCotter, an intense man and an amateur guitar player who has displayed photographs of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones in his local offices. 
 During the telephone session with constituents last Thursday, some callers praised Mr. McCotter's stance and encouraged him to keep up his fight. Many seemed much more anxious about whether the federal government would come through with more relief for the Big Three auto manufacturers -- aid that Mr. McCotter fervently supports.
 Republicans were emboldened in their opposition to the stimulus plan by their ability to successfully lampoon some provisions as frivolous and ineffective, drawing extensive news coverage and plaudits from conservative commentators. 
 But recent independent polls have shown wide public support for the measure and disapproval of the Republican approach. Some Republicans have begun to emphasize benefits in the bill for their communities even though they voted against it.
 In Michigan, Democratic officials say the Republican opposition is difficult to fathom given the deteriorating economic conditions in the state and the $18 billion Michigan stands to receive. The legislation also frees General Motors from billions of dollars in potential tax obligations on a federal loan and provides tax incentives for car buyers, though they are not as extensive as those initially approved by the Senate.
 ''Since when do Republicans vote against tax cuts?'' asked State Representative Andy Dillon, the speaker of the State House, whose district overlaps with Mr. McCotter's. ''They are betting the farm, because if this works, I think people will remember they were not on board.'' 
 Joan Gebhardt, a Wayne County commissioner who represents localities in Mr. McCotter's district, said her communities ''need help fast; people are hurting.''
 But sentiment is clearly mixed on the value of the stimulus plan, even though local manufacturers are paring their work forces, cutting back shifts for those who stay and reducing the salaries of managers and executives. Many say it is the worst economic environment they can remember in Michigan, but the stimulus is not seen as a lifeline for state manufacturers and businesses.
 ''There is nothing in there for us in Michigan in automotive,'' said Wallace E. Smith, president of the E & E Manufacturing Company, a stamping plant in Plymouth that produces seat fasteners and engine mounts. ''We need something immediate.''
 As chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, Mr. McCotter is a member of the party leadership, but he has broken ranks on some pivotal issues. He supported an expansion of a federally financed health insurance program for children. And he backs a measure to ease union organizing -- legislation that is fiercely opposed by most Republicans.
 All House Republicans from Michigan have to be on political alert since two incumbents lost their seats in November. Mr. McCotter saw his own margin of victory shrink noticeably despite being opposed by a weakly financed Democratic challenger.
 Bill Ballenger, the editor of Inside Michigan Politics, says Mr. McCotter is the most likely new target for Democrats among House members in the state. But Mr. Ballenger is skeptical that Mr. McCotter's vote against the stimulus will be much of a political liability, particularly if the economy does not improve. ''They may look like heroes a year from now,'' he said.
 Democrats evidently believe otherwise, given their new assault against Mr. McCotter and the 11 House members from eight other states, including California, Illinois, Missouri and Pennsylvania. Besides the automated phone calls, the Democratic Party on Tuesday will begin sending e-mail and text messages to voters and initiating personal phone calls to lay out the case for the stimulus package.
 Mr. McCotter said he made no political calculation in deciding how to vote but based his stance on what he thought was the right way to go. ''How can you vote for something in this situation that will do more harm than good?'' he asked.
 Yet Mr. McCotter said he would now try to see that the money is properly spent.
 ''We will try to do everything we can to squeeze every ounce of help out of what was passed,'' he said. ''We have to make the best of a bad situation.''

HEADLINE: Justice for American Indians

 BODY:
The federal government has a long history of cheating American Indians, and not all of this dirty dealing is in the distant past. On Monday, the Supreme Court hears arguments in a suit by the Navajo, who lost millions of dollars' worth of coal royalties because the government helped a coal company underpay for their coal. A lower court ruled for the Navajo Nation. The Supreme Court should affirm that well-reasoned decision. 
 The Navajo's huge reservation spreads across parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The United States holds the lands in trust and manages their large coal deposits. Peabody Coal had a lease to mine on that land. The terms provided that in 1984, the interior secretary could make a reasonable adjustment in the royalty rates paid to the tribe.
That year the department increased the royalty rate to 20 percent of gross proceeds. After Peabody protested, the Reagan administration's interior secretary met with a Peabody lobbyist, without informing the Navajo. The secretary then signed a memo blocking the increase and called for the Navajo to negotiate with Peabody. The tribe, already under severe economic pressure, ended up agreeing to a rate of just 12.5 percent. The Navajo eventually sued, arguing that the government violated its duty to look out for their interests, and that it cost them as much as $600 million in royalties. 
 They lost in the Supreme Court on one set of legal theories, but are now relying on other laws. The Washington-based United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled for the Navajo. In a unanimous ruling, the three-judge panel concluded that several federal laws impose the sort of fiduciary duty the Indians assert.
 The appeals court also made clear that the government did not live up to this duty. The ruling found that the Interior Department met ''secretly with parties having interests adverse to'' the Navajo, adopted those parties' ''desired course of action in lieu of action favorable to'' the Navajo, and misled the Navajo about its actions.
 The government's behavior was ''indefensible,'' according to four former interior secretaries, who submitted a friend-of-the-court brief to the Supreme Court. The Obama administration, which has inherited the Bush administration's position in the case, should not continue to stand up for these misdeeds.

HEADLINE: China Fears Rural Tremors as Migrants Flock From Coast

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Zhang Jing contributed research.

DATELINE: TANJIA, China 

 BODY:
Tan Tianying might not look like a troublemaker, but she and millions of other workers like her have government leaders fretting about the country's stability. 
 A shy, delicately built seamstress who makes aprons and coveralls in Guangzhou, Ms. Tan, 24, is part of an army of migrants, 130 million strong, who have flocked to cities for jobs, but whose prospects for continued employment are increasingly dim. 
 As the global economic crisis deepens and the demand for Chinese exports slackens, manufacturing jobs in the Pearl River Delta and all along the once-booming coast are disappearing at a stunning pace. Over the last few months, more than 20 million migrant workers have been cast into the ranks of the unemployed, depriving impoverished towns like Tanjia of the much-needed income the workers sent home. 
 Since December, hundreds of employees at Ms. Tan's uniform factory have been let go and wages have been cut by a third as orders from the United States dry up. Last year, 2,400 factories in and around Guangzhou closed. 
 ''I hope I still have a job,'' Ms. Tan said this month, a few hours before leaving Tanjia on a train for the 10-hour ride that in recent years has carried away most of the town's working-age residents. ''I don't want to go back to being a poor farmer.''
 In a nation obsessed with social harmony, the well-being of China's mobile work force has become the top priority for a government that has long seen its fortunes tied to those of the country's 800 million rural dwellers. Mao's revolution, after all, was fueled by embittered peasants, and it has not gone unnoticed in Beijing that decades of heady growth has fed a widening gap between urban residents and those who live in the rural interior.
 Although the government has not released updated information about rural unrest, officials have been strategizing about how best to keep large protests and riots from spreading, should the dispossessed grow unruly. 
 This week, more than 3,000 public security directors from across the country are gathering in the capital to learn how to neutralize rallies and strikes before they blossom into so-called mass incidents. At a meeting of the Chinese cabinet last month, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao told government leaders they should prepare for rough times ahead. ''The country's employment situation is extremely grim,'' he said. 
 To ameliorate the hardship of idled migrants, the central government has announced a series of initiatives that include vocational training, an expansion of rural health care and crop subsidies to ensure that those who return to the land can make a living despite a slump in agricultural prices. A $585 billion stimulus package introduced in November, much of it weighted toward labor-intensive construction projects, is also expected to absorb some of the newly unemployed.
 But here in Tanjia and the surrounding countryside of northeast Hunan Province, most people say they have yet to see much in the way of government largess. As the Lunar New Year came to an end two weeks ago, many migrants who had come home for the holidays were anxious to return south, where they hoped to reclaim their old jobs or find new ones. 
 About 40 percent of the town's 2,000 residents work outside the province, and their remittances have been a lifeline for the children and elderly people who remain behind. Much of that money has been spent on motorcycles, high school educations and new homes, some trimmed with Corinthian columns and ceramic dragons, that are the brick-and-mortar embodiment of this newfound prosperity. 
 Ms. Tan's family home, like those of her neighbors, is a work in progress. Since 2005, her mother, father and brother, all migrant workers, have poured $15,000 into the two-story house, but they still need another $9,000 for appliances, fixtures and a white tiled facade. ''We have no savings,'' said her father, Tan Liangsheng, 52, a haggard-looking man who recently lost his job as a construction worker. ''All our hard work and bitterness is invested in this house.''
 Just behind him sat the mud-brick structure where the extended Tan clan used to live. 
 In some ways, Tanjia's residents are luckier than most. Unlike China's drought-stricken north and its chronically arid west, Hunan Province is well watered and blessed with a temperate climate that allows farmers to grow food much of the year. 
 Still, with 64 million people squeezed into an area the size of Kansas, most people make do with tiny plots of land; in Tanjia the average size is a tenth of an acre. ''Maybe we won't starve to death, but life would become very difficult if everyone came back home,'' said Long Feng, 29, who works at a car repair shop in Shenzhen, not far from the Hong Kong border. 
 In Zhuzhou, the nearest city of any consequence, government officials are not very concerned about a surge in jobless farmers. 
 Chen Shuxian, director of Zhuzhou's employment center, said he was more worried about the 3.7 million people who live in and around his booming city, people who have become accustomed to relatively comfortable lives. ''They have cellphone bills and rent to pay,'' he said. ''The migrants don't have a lot of expectations and they can always fall back on the land and their family savings.''
 Such sentiments are common in China, where rural laborers are often viewed as dime-a-dozen workhorses capable of enduring enormous hardship. He Xuefeng, a professor who studies rural life, said many manufacturers believed the most productive workers were spent by 40.
 ''As workers grow older, they can't work as quickly or accurately, so they are naturally eliminated,'' said Mr. He, who teaches at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Hubei Province. ''The financial crisis will simply speed up that process by two or three years and force them to return home earlier.''
 After he lost his job at a glass factory in Guangzhou last year, Wang Liming, 39, returned to his home on the outskirts of Zhuzhou thinking he could find employment nearby. Things turned more dire after his wife lost her job just before the New Year festivities. 
 He acknowledged that there was work to be had in Zhuzhou, but those jobs generally pay less than $100 a month, about half what a semiskilled assembly line position pays in Guangzhou. 
 ''I couldn't even afford my daughter's high school tuition on that kind of salary,'' he said, standing in front of his home, a half-built box that lacks windows and a refrigerator. 
 A gruff, chain-smoking man, Mr. Wang said the decade he spent in the south turned him off to agricultural work. ''I hate working the fields,'' he said as his neighbors nodded in agreement. Even if they wanted to, he and his fellow villagers could not make much money from farming: some of the best patches of land have been swallowed up by Zhuzhou's rapid development, including the electric generating plant that dominates the view from his front door. 
 Asked about his plans, Mr. Wang shook his head, glanced at his cellphone and said he was waiting for friends in Guangzhou to call him about a job. ''I'm just hoping the phone rings,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Why Can't Cerberus Foot the Bill?

 BODY:
When General Motors and Chrysler asked Washington for more money last week they took very different approaches. In exchange for an extra $17 billion from taxpayers -- on top of the $13 billion it had gotten since December -- G.M. said it would reduce costs by shuttering plants, cutting brands and slashing 47,000 jobs, about a fifth of its remaining work force. 
 For its $5.3 billion -- on top of the $4.3 billion it has received since December -- Chrysler offered little more than an assurance that it has already cut costs and accomplished most of what it had to do to become a valuable, viable company. It offered to trim production by a paltry 100,000 units -- leaving it with capacity to make almost one million vehicles more than it will sell this year -- on the questionable assumption that demand, and its market share, will bounce back next year. 
 Chrysler said the only reason it was back asking for more money so soon was that the car market was worse than it had expected two months ago. 
 This cavalier approach to the public purse raises a very big question. If Chrysler is really on track for a turnaround and all it needs is some financing to get over a bad patch in sales and debt markets, why doesn't Cerberus Capital Management, which owns 80 percent of the company, put up the money itself? Why should taxpayers have to take the risk? That's what private equity funds like Cerberus are supposed to do.
 Cerberus and Daimler, which retained a stake in Chrysler, have promised to convert $2 billion in loans to Chrysler into equity, which should help reduce its debt. But Cerberus said giving fresh money would violate its fiduciary duty to investors, breaking company rules limiting how much it can commit to any given investment. 
 We suspect these rules would be more pliant if Cerberus deemed Chrysler to be a good deal. 
 It seems the secretive private-equity fund is willing to gamble on Chrysler's survival with the taxpayer's dime, but not its own. 
 Chrysler warns that if it doesn't get more money from Washington it will have to declare bankruptcy. 
 Our argument for bailing out Detroit has been based on the notion that the collapse of the American carmakers would devastate an economy already reeling from huge job losses. 
 The case for saving Chrysler is certainly the weakest. It is the smallest of the Big Three, employing just more than 40,000 hourly workers. As President Obama and his aides consider whether to supply new funds, they should carefully weigh all of the arguments. 
 We do not minimize the personal suffering of Chrysler's employees if the company goes under. We urge the White House to carefully analyze how wide the pain would spread. But we are somewhat skeptical about the claim in Chrysler's brief to the Treasury that allowing it to go into bankruptcy could risk its liquidation, at the cost of hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of jobs at Chrysler, its dealers and suppliers. 
 It also said a bankruptcy would cost the government more than this bailout. Given the state of the debt market, it said the government would likely end up providing the bulk of the so-called debtor-in-possession financing -- an estimated $24 billion -- which allows a company to remain in operation and pay its bills while it gets through an orderly bankruptcy. 
 Still, there may be other arguments for saying no to Chrysler. It might finally shake G.M., its creditors and the autoworkers' union out of their complacency, forcing them to reach an agreement to reduce the beleaguered automaker's liabilities.

HEADLINE: Chief of Honda To Step Aside

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Honda Motor Company, Japan's second-largest carmaker, said on Monday that its president, Takeo Fukui was stepping down. 
 Honda named Takanobu Ito as president to lead the company as the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression hammers demand for autos.
 Mr. Ito, 55, will replace Mr. Fukui in June, the company said in a statement issued to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Mr. Fukui, 64, will become an adviser to the carmaker.
 The new appointment comes as Honda confronts its first quarterly loss in at least 15 years as vehicle demand in the United States and Japan plummets and a stronger yen erodes overseas earnings. The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's biggest carmaker, has also named a new president, Akio Toyoda, to head the company later this year.
 Honda shares dropped 4.5 percent in afternoon trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: The Facebook Era Is for Adults, Too

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
It's probably safe to say that Whopper Sacrifice, Burger King's impish Facebook campaign that offered free burgers to anyone dropping 10 friends, wasn't aimed at retirees. But maybe it should have been. 
 A recent report from Forrester Research indicates that while it might be tempting to categorize all Americans of a certain age as techno-dinosaurs and Luddites, more than 60 percent of baby boomers are avid consumers of social media like blogs, forums, podcasts and online videos. That's up from roughly 40 percent a year ago.
 ''Social media adoption is going up for all generations,'' said Jeremiah K. Owyang, author of the report and a senior analyst with Forrester Research. That boomers are increasingly using these tools is a clear indication that it's not just a fad, he said.
 It helps that President Barack Obama, at age 47 a baby boomer, readily took to social technologies and made them part of his administration, Mr. Owyang said. ''It's a clear indicator that social technologies are here to stay.'' JENNA WORTHAM

HEADLINE: Articles on Editor's Killing Made a Difference

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
When Chauncey Bailey, the editor of The Oakland Post, in California, was gunned down in broad daylight on a city street 18 months ago, it was not the end of his journalism. In some ways, it was a new beginning. 
 After his death, a group of reporters -- some retired, some out of work -- with support from foundations and the University of California, Berkeley, banded together to continue his investigation into a local business called Your Black Muslim Bakery and to look at any role the bakery may have played in Mr. Bailey's murder and at the role of the police in its investigation. 
 The group, named The Chauncey Bailey Project, has had a deep impact on the city's public life, revealing a jailhouse videotape that suggested a wider conspiracy in the murder and which the police seemingly ignored, and helping force the resignation of the Oakland police chief, Wayne Tucker. 
 The group has said that much of its work is done, but it says it will not shutter the operation completely until the investigation of Yusuf Bey IV, a son of the founder of the bakery, has been completed. Mr. Tucker suggested that an indictment was likely during a news conference after his resignation and that it would show a larger conspiracy in the murder of Mr. Bailey. Mr. Bey has denied culpability in the murder in an interview with one of the reporters on the project. 
 Rebecca Kaplan, a City Council member, publicly credited the group of reporters with airing the police's dirty laundry. 
 ''Even if everything was an honest mistake, the Chauncey Bailey case is shining a light on what we need to be looking at,'' Ms. Kaplan said. 
 Robert Rosenthal, the executive director of the Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit organization based in Berkeley that became the headquarters for the project, said the participants came together in part as a result of the decimation of local media, which precluded large-scale investigative work. 
 ''I think the issues of downsizing and economic turmoil are the catalyst for this,'' said Mr. Rosenthal, a former editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer.
 Mr. Bailey had a place in Oakland newspaper lore not necessarily as a gifted reporter but for his ubiquity in the community and ear for neighborhood chatter. He was once fired from The Oakland Tribune for an ethical breach, but had another act as editor of The Oakland Post.
 There, he began to look into Your Black Muslim Bakery, now defunct but once a prominent institution in the city's black community. It sprouted in the late 1960s against the backdrop of the Black Power movement and was once praised for giving jobs to young African-Americans.
 The bakery went bankrupt in 2006, leaving a wake of violence, an unpaid loan to the city of Oakland, problems with the Internal Revenue Service, and unrest. Its founder, Yusuf Bey, died in 2003. His son Yusuf Bey IV was briefly the leader of the organization, but now sits in jail, charged with kidnapping, torture and carjacking. The charges are not related to the Bailey investigation.
 On Aug. 2, 2007, Mr. Bailey was shot three times with a sawed-off shotgun as he walked to work after eating breakfast at McDonald's. Days later, a former dishwasher at the bakery, Devaughndre Broussard, was charged with the murder. 
 The project formed in the fall of 2007. It modeled itself on The Arizona Project, which was created after the 1976 car-bomb murder of Don Bolles, an Arizona Republic reporter who had been writing about organized crime.
 The reporters began by examining the bakery. 
 ''Pretty soon, we found the bakery was a cesspool,'' said Bob Butler, an independent journalist who was a longtime reporter for CBS Radio before he was laid off in 2006. 
 In a series of articles published last year in The Tribune, The Contra Costa Times and on KTVU-TV, a Bay Area television station, the journalists reported a longstanding relationship between the detective in charge of the Bailey case and the younger Mr. Bey. It also found that the detective had not included in his case notes data from a tracking device on Mr. Bey's car that showed him outside Mr. Bailey's apartment the night before the murder, the articles said. 
 Mary Fricker, a retired reporter who had worked for 20 years at The Santa Rosa Press-Democrat, pored over databases and old files and documented a pattern of sexual assault and misconduct by the founder of the bakery. She joined the project, even though she lives two hours north of Oakland in wine country, and spent many nights on a colleague's couch. 
 ''Could the local media have done this story? No, especially because it came at a time when local media was imploding,'' Ms. Fricker said.
 The pivotal point for the project occurred on an afternoon last spring. Over a sushi lunch in a downtown Oakland restaurant, a source slipped Thomas Peele, a reporter for The Bay Area News Group, a videotape.
 The tape, secretly recorded by the police, showed Yusuf Bey IV sitting with associates in a jailhouse room, bragging about being a part of Mr. Bailey's murder. It raised critical questions -- still unanswered -- about why the police had not charged Mr. Bey in the murder.
 The reporting also led to a number of investigations by agencies outside Oakland. The Bailey murder case has been taken from the Oakland police and turned over to the Alameda County district attorney's office. Jerry Brown, the California attorney general, is investigating the way police handled the case.
 More recently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation stepped in to investigate allegations raised by the project that the chief of internal affairs at the department had beaten a drug suspect, who later died. The project also reopened a decades-old murder case in Santa Barbara, Calif., where a precursor to the bakery operated in the 1960s. 
 Last month, Chief Tucker, the head of Oakland's police, announced he would step down, in part as a result of the handling of the Bailey murder investigation.
 ''We made mistakes on that case,'' he said at a news conference, and acknowledged that Yusuf Bey IV is ''the one we want'' to complete the case.
 Reporters involved in the project gently point out that they have pushed the inquiry further than Mr. Bailey might have. 
 Mr. Bailey, who was posthumously named Journalist of the Year by the Northern California Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists for his ''fierce commitment to investigative journalism in the face of personal danger,'' was not regarded as an investigative journalist. He had written a draft of an article on the bakery, but it had been killed because its reporting was subpar, according to Paul Cobb, the publisher of The Oakland Post. 
 ''There's been more scrutiny of the Oakland Police Department because of his death than he ever would have accomplished at The Oakland Post,'' Mr. Peele said.
 Martin Reynolds, the editor of The Oakland Tribune and an executive with The Bay Area News Group, the paper's parent company, has been heartened by the strong reaction to the project. 
 ''The response from our readers has shown that the best way to preserve our relevance is through investigative reporting,'' said Mr. Reynolds, who has steadily cut his own company's newsrooms. ''It's what we can still do better than anyone else.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 26, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the Chauncey Bailey Project, a collaboration of journalists that has been investigating the murder of an Oakland newspaper editor, referred incorrectly in some editions to the source of a jailhouse videotape of the suspect that was slipped to Thomas Peele, one of the reporters on the project. While Mr. Peele did not identify the source by name, he also did not say a police source gave it to him.
 In addition, the article may have left the incorrect impression that the Chauncey Bailey Project was the only news organization investigating Mr. Bailey's death. The San Francisco Chronicle reported on the existence of the videotape before the project acquired that tape and broadcast it; the project did not first report the tape's existence. And while the project reported on a relationship between the suspect and a detective on the case, The Chronicle established that connection and reported details of it. The Chauncey Bailey Project did not first report the suspect's relationship with the detective.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Saving Federal Arts Funds: Selling Culture as an Economic Force'' (Arts pages, Feb. 16): Representative Jack Kingston of Georgia argues against allocating stimulus money for artists, saying, ''Call me a sucker for the working man.'' So be a sucker for artists! 
 Most of us are hard-working Americans, putting in long hours for low wages. Many of us are union members. If legislators really think we are such useless members of American society unworthy of scarce taxpayer dollars, then they should propose legislation exempting us from paying taxes. 
 Until that day, stop mislabeling and misunderstanding us and acknowledge that we contribute as much and deserve the same benefits as any other American taxpayer -- no more and no less.
 It is irrational to hold a belief that somehow artists are not a vital part of this country's infrastructure. Look around you. Our work and our influence are everywhere. 
 After all, that money you say artists don't deserve, who do you think designed and engraved it?

HEADLINE: Detainee to Return to Britain, as Efforts to Prove Torture Claims Continue

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
A Guantanamo detainee whose case has drawn international attention because of his assertions that he was tortured while in C.I.A. custody is scheduled to arrive back in Britain on Monday, according to his lawyers and British officials.
 The detainee, Binyam Mohamed, has been in American custody for nearly seven years, held and interrogated first in Pakistan, then for 18 months in Morocco, and also in Afghanistan, before being sent to the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prison camp.
 His return will end an 18-month standoff between the United States and Britain, which has been seeking his release since August 2007. 
 It will not, however, end an effort by Mr. Mohamed's lawyers and some members of Parliament here to obtain photographs that Mr. Mohamed said were taken by an American woman and showed his injuries, according to notes of his conversations with his lawyer, who provided the notes to The New York Times.
 At the time of his arrest, in April 2002, American officials said that Mr. Mohamed, who has a brother and two sisters living in the United States, was part of a conspiracy to detonate a dirty bomb on American soil. But all charges against him were dismissed. ''I am confident he will be home tomorrow,'' said his lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, ''and it is not a moment too soon.'' 
 A British government official who declined to be identified confirmed Mr. Mohamed's expected return but would give no other details. On Friday, the British Foreign Office issued a statement that final arrangements were under way for his release.
 American Embassy officials in London refused to comment on the situation, saying that as a matter of policy they could not talk about Guantanamo releases that had not yet happened. A spokesman for the Pentagon, which oversees the prison camp, would not comment about his release or his claims of abuse.The British government began concentrated efforts for Mr. Mohamed's return in August 2007, but it was rebuffed by the Bush administration. 
 One stumbling block was the restrictions to be put on him when he was released. The British government said it could not impose the conditions wanted by the United States, which included electronic surveillance and an official control order, because they violated British and European human rights laws. 
 Mr. Mohamed has agreed to voluntary restrictions, including a lifetime prohibition on travel to the United States, according to people who have seen the restrictions. Those people spoke on condition of anonymity, and they gave no more details about the restrictions because the terms of Mr. Mohamed's release had not been publicly disclosed. 
 Mr. Mohamed was born in Ethiopia, but his family fled for political reasons in the early 1990s. He moved to Britain in 1994, where he was unemployed and into drugs, his lawyer said. In 2000, he went to Afghanistan to get off drugs -- the Taliban had a strict policy against domestic drug use -- and to decide whether it was a ''good Islamic country or not,'' he told his lawyer.
 American officials have said that he attended military training camps in Afghanistan. Mr. Mohamed has said he was training to fight in support of Muslim insurgents in Chechnya, not to carry out terrorist attacks in the United States.
 After the fighting broke out between the United States and the Taliban in late 2001, Mr. Mohamed fled Afghanistan. He was caught in Karachi, Pakistan, trying to get on a plane to Britain with a false British passport. He said his had been lost.
 After several months of interrogation in Pakistan, he was secretly taken on a C.I.A.-chartered plane to Morocco, according to the plane's flight logs and British officials. The C.I.A. has repeatedly declined to say if he was ever held in Morocco and has steadfastly denied that Mr. Mohamed, or anyone else in its custody, was ever tortured. 
 At a news conference here last week, his military lawyer, Lt. Col. Yvonne Bradley of the United States Air Force, said that what Mr. Mohamed endured at Guantanamo ''makes waterboarding look like child's play.''
 For 18 months, ''I never went outside, I never saw the sun, not even once,'' Mr. Stafford Smith quoted Mr. Mohamed as saying during one of their many sessions at the prison camp. Immediately after each interview, Mr. Stafford Smith would write down what he had been told and submit it to the military for clearance.
 Mr. Stafford Smith provided The Times with a 25-page memorandum of his interviews with Mr. Mohamed, which had been cleared by the military.
 Interrogators in Morocco showed him pictures of various leaders of Al Qaeda and asked him if he knew them, Mr. Stafford Smith said. Mr. Mohamed insisted he did not. 
 One night, three men in black masks and military trousers came in, he told his lawyer. ''One stood on each of my shoulders and the third punched me in the stomach,'' Mr. Mohamed said.
 Other times, he said, they tied him to a wall, his feet just off the floor. They brought in women, ''naked or part naked,'' he said.
 On one occasion, while tied to the wall, his clothes were taken off, he said. Then a man took a scalpel and made cuts on his chest. Then they cut his genitals, Mr. Mohamed said.
 ''I suffered the razor treatment about once a month,'' Mr. Mohamed said, according to Mr. Stafford Smith's declassified notes of the interview.
 In January 2004, five soldiers wearing face masks and Timberland boots dragged him from his cell and stripped him. He heard an American accent. There was a woman in the group. She took pictures of his wounds with a digital camera, he said. He was taken to the American-run Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, his lawyer said, where more photographs were taken. One of the soldiers told him it was ''to show Washington it's healing,'' Mr. Mohamed told his lawyer.
 Mr. Mohamed's lawyers have been trying to obtain the photographs and documents, which they say support Mr. Mohamed's allegations. A British court has said that classified documents support Mr. Mohamed's assertions, but the American and British governments have objected to their release.

HEADLINE: Where Athletes Run, Jump and Mull Life as a Cat

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS 

 BODY:
Along with medical tests and drills to measure physical skills, the N.F.L. scouting combine allows 32 teams to talk to top prospects for 15 minutes each. It is like speed dating for draft choices, and the questions are not always about football. 
 ''I'm loving it,'' Rutgers receiver Kenny Britt said at Lucas Oil Stadium. ''They all come with their own crazy ideas.'' The strangest question, Britt said, was, ''If you die, what kind of animal would you like to come back as: a cat or a dog?'' 
 Rey Maualuga, a linebacker from Southern California with long, thick, dark hair, said a coach had asked him if he would ''flip out'' if he were told to cut his hair. 
 Scott McKillop, a linebacker from Pittsburgh, said he was discussing his mother when a scout suddenly blurted, ''Have you ever smoked marijuana?'' 
 Marcus Freeman, an Ohio State linebacker, said a coach had asked him whether he would prefer to make five Pro Bowls or one Super Bowl. He found the question hard to answer. 
 If he chose Pro Bowls, Freeman said, ''It's not about the team.'' But if he said Super Bowl, ''You don't want to be the best.'' 
 His answer? 
 ''Super Bowl,'' Freeman said. 
 Such ambition is generally applauded at the weeklong event, which ends Tuesday, as teams compile files for the draft April 25 and 26. This gathering is part track meet, part convention and part job fair. 
 It is being held at a new domed stadium that looks from the outside like an old-fashioned field house with bricks and big windows. Inside, players run 40-yard dashes and other drills before near-empty grandstands. 
 Near the field is a media room with three podiums, where coaches, general managers and players conduct interviews. Not all conversations concern the draft. Bill Polian, the president of the Indianapolis Colts, was one of several executives discussing the economic crisis that has affected even this big business. 
 ''We have had some large layoffs in our building,'' he said. ''We have not seen the full effect of the recession. It's sort of a murky picture. I'm worried as an American that everything is hurting.'' 
 Ozzie Newsome, the Baltimore Ravens' general manager, said, ''When you talk about suite sales, yes, it has impacted us.'' 
 Drawing one of the largest gatherings for his news conference was New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick. One of his fondest combine memories, Belichick said, was from the 1980s, at sundown in Arizona, watching William Perry, the Fridge, perform the vertical jump. 
 Belichick spoke at surprising length of his regret over veteran coaches who have lost their jobs. He mentioned Mike Shanahan, fired by Denver; and Jon Gruden, let go by Tampa Bay. Such things gave Belichick ''a little bit of an empty feeling,'' he said. But when asked if he objected to the youth movement in coaching, Belichick said, ''I'm not trying to solve the world's problems.'' 
 Most players have agents in town who hire advisers to teach the players to communicate, but some are just naturally gregarious. James Laurinaitis a linebacker from Ohio State, spoke of his father, a professional wrestler known as Animal, and his mother, a fitness model. 
 ''I've been blessed with great genes,'' Laurinaitis said. Regarding his position, he said: ''I like being the leader. In the middle, you're held more accountable. I love being that guy.'' 
 Laurinaitis has hair as short as Maualuga's is long. All week, Maualuga said, he has been singing the Trojans' fight song to Laurinaitis and Freeman to remind them that the Trojans beat the Buckeyes last season. 
 ''I give them trash, here and there,'' Maualuga said. ''It's all love.'' 
 The drills, more serious, allow players to compete with others at their positions. Mark Sanchez, a quarterback from Southern California, showed some nimble footwork Sunday, moving side to side and back and forth on hand signals from a coach. 
 Hurting his image Saturday was Andre Smith, the Alabama tackle, a potential first-round draft choice, who went home abruptly without much explanation. (Smith missed the Sugar Bowl this year because of a suspension.) 
 Michael Crabtree of Texas Tech, one of the top receivers the past two years, announced the discovery of a stress fracture in his left foot that required surgery. 
 ''I never had any pain in it,'' Crabtree said, then refused to take questions. 
 Among the most serious talkers was Rhett Bomar of Sam Houston State, who was expelled from Oklahoma for taking money for a no-show job. ''I overcame a lot and I'm proud of that,'' he said. ''A lot of these guys, everything's gone perfect their whole career, their whole life.'' 
 Giants CoachTom Coughlin -- a stickler for efficiency and scheduling -- praised the evolution of the combine, recalling years when scouts ''had to scramble to get interviews with players.'' 
 Now, Coughlin said, ''There's very little wasted time.'' Rex Ryan, the new Jets coach, was one of the most visible visitors, smiling broadly and often as he made the rounds. 
 Ryan, the son of the famed N.F.L. coach Buddy Ryan, avoided questions about going after the potential free-agent linebacker Ray Lewis, whom he coached as the defensive coordinator in Baltimore. 
 ''The tampering rules,'' Ryan explained. 
 But he spoke out on other subjects and talked in the stands Sunday with Jets General Manager Mike Tannenbaum and Woody Johnson, the team's owner. 
 When asked what he looked for in college players, Ryan said, ''I look for a fan of football, the guy who understands the history of this game, coach's kids.'' 
 Ryan said, however, that sometimes he came away from interviews with even good players thinking, ''Whoa, this kid's got no idea what it's going to take.''

HEADLINE: Antigua to Cooperate With U.S. in Investigation of Its Banks

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: ST. JOHN'S, Antigua 

 BODY:
Having seized control of Robert Allen Stanford's two banks in recent days, Antiguan government officials are now pledging to work closely with American regulators to investigate their banking system, long suspected by federal officials of being a center for laundering money from around the region.
 ''We are prepared to cooperate fully with the Americans in probing this whole affair,'' Prime Minister Winston Baldwin Spencer said on Sunday evening. He added that the scandal ''has serious implications'' for the offshore banking sector. 
 That acknowledgment countered statements only last week by local bank regulators that the financial system in Antigua was absolutely clean. It comes after the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Mr. Stanford in a civil complaint of engaging in an $8 billion fraud involving high-yielding certificates of deposit sold by an offshore bank here. Mr. Stanford has not been criminally charged.
 A run on both of Mr. Stanford's banks in Antigua began last week as news spread that a judge in the United States had frozen the assets of Stanford Financial Group, the company based in Houston that sold the offshore bank's certificates. 
 Antiguan government officials have taken the actions, unprecedented in its largely unregulated banking system, because they are concerned that Antigua's economy, which is already hurting from a downturn in tourism tied to the global economic crisis, could suffer further from a financial breakdown.
 On Friday, the island nation's Financial Services Regulatory Commission appointed two receivers employed by a British accounting firm to manage Mr. Stanford's offshore bank, known as Stanford International Bank. Meanwhile, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank has assumed control of Mr. Stanford's local bank, the Bank of Antigua, which is used mostly by Antiguans and residents of other Caribbean countries.
 The seizures could represent a major turn in Caribbean offshore banking, which, along with tourism, is a major economic engine for many island nations here. It comes only days after the Swiss bank UBS agreed to pay a $780 million fine and turn over the names of hundreds of American depositors to settle a criminal inquiry into its offshore private banking services.
 Jonathan M. Winer, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who worked to strengthen banking regulations in Antigua, said the Stanford scandal and the American and Antiguan response to it were part of a new direction for offshore banking.
 ''We are on the verge of an emerging new global regime to demand financial transparency across all sectors and across all jurisdictions as the price of access to the international financial system,'' Mr. Winer said. ''One outcome will be that finally everyone will have to be under the same level of regulatory and enforcement controls if their activities touch financial markets.'' 
 David Marchant, publisher of the OffshoreAlert newsletter, however, said he was ''skeptical the Antiguan authorities will honestly cooperate'' with American authorities. ''What is surprising is that the Antiguans didn't investigate and close down these Stanford banks'' before the United States seized Mr. Stanford's American operations, which he said reflected the laxity of regulation in Antigua. 
 An investigation of the Stanford banks could be good politically for Mr. Spencer, who is in a tough re-election campaign against the former prime minister, Lester Bird. Most of Mr. Stanford's deals were made under the Bird government, which lost the last election in 2004.
 ''I'm sure various other offshore companies are going to worry exactly how far S.E.C. control will go,'' said Justin L. Simon, the attorney general. He added that his government now intended to investigate where billions of dollars that had been deposited in Mr. Stanford's banks had gone. He said the government would seek to work with American regulators to find the money and uncover any possible crimes.
 ''I trust there will be cooperation,'' he said. ''If there was fraud, we also have jurisdiction and we will take action.''
 Cooperation between the United States and Antiguan governments has had its ups and downs in recent years, but never has the offshore banking system faced such a crisis. John Nester, a spokesman for the S.E.C., said, ''We always welcome cooperation in combating cross-border fraud.'' 
 According to a State Department report last year, the two-island nation of Antigua and Barbuda ''remains susceptible to money laundering because of its offshore financial sectors and Internet gaming industry.'' It noted that Antigua had 17 offshore banks, three offshore trusts, two offshore insurance companies and 23 licensed Internet gaming companies.
 Most of these companies are tiny, but they operate in a freewheeling environment that American regulators have long sought to tighten, especially in the latter days of the Clinton administration, when concerns mounted that Russian organized crime was moving into the offshore banking sector.
 Although Antigua tightened some of its offshore banking regulations in order to be removed from a Treasury Department money laundering watch list around the same time, Antiguan regulations still allow a company with only $5 million to open a bank, and charge only $15,000 for a banking license. There are also sweeping confidentiality laws that include criminal penalties for whistle-blowers.

 BODY:
Accounts
 Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, Calif., expanded its relationship with the Omnicom Group by awarding the Omnicom Media Group division the assignment to handle worldwide media planning and buying for four H.P. units. The account, for campaigns with spending estimated at $1 billion, had been handled primarily by ZenithOptimedia, part of the Publicis Groupe. H.P. also awarded worldwide advertising and marketing duties for one of the four units, the technology solutions group, to a consortium of Omnicom agencies that includes Goodby, Silverstein & Partners and Rapp. H.P. already worked with Goodby, Silverstein and other Omnicom agencies like BBDO Worldwide. 
 The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, expanded its relationship with Bartle Bogle Hegarty by naming the agency to create campaigns for Sprite. The assignment, with spending estimated at $20 million to $25 million, had most recently been handled by Crispin Porter & Bogusky, Miami, part of MDC Partners. The New York and Shanghai offices of Bartle Bogle will work on the account. The agency was recently named to create campaigns for the Vitaminwater line of beverages sold by Coca-Cola.
 The Caribou Coffee Company, Brooklyn Center, Minn., chose Colle & McVoy, Minneapolis, as agency of record on its account. Caribou had previously worked with various regional agencies on a project basis. Spending was estimated at $2 million.
 People
 Richard Constant, chairman and chief executive at Gavin Anderson & Company, part of the Omnicom Group, was named president and chief executive at Kreab Gavin Anderson, which is being formed by the merger of Gavin Anderson and a Swedish agency, the Kreab Group, part of Magnora.

HEADLINE: Oh the Economic Meltdown Has Pearly Teeth, Dear

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
What do Rod Blagojevich and Bernie Madoff have to do with Weimar Germany? On Wednesday evening Ute Lemper, the smirking, haughty German cabaret diva, dropped their names in her fearless, witty new cabaret show, ''The Last Tango in Berlin,'' at Cafe Carlyle, where she is playing a three-week engagement. 
 In adding them to the rogues' gallery of ''Moritat,'' the song from ''The Threepenny Opera'' better known as ''Mack the Knife,'' she pointedly equated the nihilistic chaos of 1920s Germany with the sinking feeling brought on by today's economic meltdown. What goes around comes around is how she sees it.
Because Ms. Lemper, who was born in Germany in 1963, has a much keener historical sense than most Americans, one of her missions has always been to rub our noses in our ignorance in the hopes of waking us up. Onstage she embodies a zany wildcat version of Marlene Dietrich's Lola from ''The Blue Angel.'' More than seduction (that's the easy part), her goal is to educate and enlighten while entertaining on a lofty intellectual level. ''The Last Tango in Berlin'' could be described as a surreal multicultural, multilingual history lesson. 
 Ms. Lemper's extremely theatrical singing, it must be said, is not for all tastes, especially when she pushes her voice to an unhinged caterwaul. She is accompanied by Vana Gierig on piano and Tito Castro on the bandoneon, an accordionlike instrument he plays with such remarkable sensitivity that it almost becomes another voice, growling and sighing and lending the show powerful emotional undercurrents. 
 The bandoneon's history is one of several stories Ms. Lemper relates. Invented in Germany in the 19th century, it was exported to Argentina, where it became the textural foundation of the tango, then re-emerged in Europe as a nightclub staple. Her story was augmented with tango music by Astor Piazzolla, outfitted with her own English lyrics about death and insanity. 
 The songs were interwoven with stream-of-consciousness fantasies, one revolving around images of skaters in Central Park, another tracing the imaginary history of a red feather boa from its possession by European cabaret stars through female heads of state to Sarah Palin and Michelle Obama. In Ms. Lemper's internationalist outlook, all things are connected, with Berlin the starting point. 
 Ute Lemper performs through March 7 at Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan; (212) 744-1600 or thecarlyle.com.

HEADLINE: Obama to Tell Congress How Agenda Will Aid Economy

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama will use his first address to Congress on Tuesday to present a road map for ''how we get to a better day,'' a senior adviser says, in a speech intended to explain his economic policies and argue that legislative revisions on health care, education and energy are crucial to lifting the economy. 
 The appearance before a joint session of the Senate and the House offers an opportunity for Mr. Obama to reprise some themes and initiatives from his campaign that have been overshadowed by the economic emergency that has defined the first month of his presidency. 
 The televised speech, which his advisers have been preparing for as though it were a formal State of the Union address, is typically an opening act on Capitol Hill for a new president, a moment to outline specific goals of an administration. But the appearance by Mr. Obama follows a string of legislative action, notably passage of the economic stimulus package, along with a wave of criticism over a series of government bailouts and rescue plans.
 ''Sometimes these speeches can be a series of disembodied initiatives, a catalog of ideas that don't necessarily cohere,'' said David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the president. ''Today, we've got huge challenges that are very much related, so there is a narrative to tell about how we get to a better day.''
 The president is not planning to announce significant new policies, officials said, but intends to explain how his agenda can advance despite the deepening recession and monumental budget deficit. The address will be heavily weighted toward domestic priorities and the economy, aides said, and will offer only a brief look at foreign policy.
 Of all the megaphones commanded by a president, a speech delivered to a joint session of Congress is among the grandest. Lawmakers will be seated in the House chamber, along with Supreme Court justices, high-ranking military advisers and officials from throughout the government. A few seats will remain empty, given the president's struggle to complete his cabinet.
 The White House also has another audience keenly in mind: the millions of Americans who will be watching on television, including those who may be skeptical of the president's plans to aid homeowners fighting foreclosure or rescue banks struggling to remain solvent.
 ''Longer exposures allow people to take a measure of a person, rather than a snapshot,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the president's chief of staff. ''It's only been a month since he was sworn into office, but hopefully they will walk away with something more intrinsic to sustain him through the ups and down and all the turns in the road.''
 The address comes at an opportune time for Mr. Obama, whose approval ratings remain strong despite growing criticism about some of the administration's economic plans. The White House was frustrated by a furor that erupted on cable television last week over whether some homeowners facing foreclosure were being given an unfair break. The speech, aides said, is intended to better explain why the intervention is needed.
 While Mr. Obama will not lay out specific sacrifices he is asking of Americans, Mr. Emanuel said, a section of the address will be devoted to ''what we're going to have to give up'' to withstand the challenges facing the nation.
 ''Everybody's going to have to stop holding on to fixed positions,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''Everybody has to have the notion that to make the system better, you're going to have to give a little.''
 The speech offers Mr. Obama his most expansive opportunity yet to explain how he believes principal pieces of his agenda can -- and need to -- be accomplished. He hopes to expand health care coverage, improve education programs, increase the country's energy independence and bolster regulations for the financial industry.
 Although the Democrats control Congress and can help advance his agenda, the political challenges for the White House will be made instantly clear during the speech by the level of applause that his proposals receive. Republicans stood in near-unified opposition against his $787 billion economic stimulus plan, a signal of the rigid partisan lines already forming in the second month of his presidency.
 Instead of selecting a member of the House or the Senate to respond to Mr. Obama, Republicans asked Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana to make the party's official statement after the address.
 In a prelude to the 2010 budget outline he will present to Congress on Thursday, Mr. Obama also will explain his goal of cutting the estimated $1.2 trillion deficit at least in half by the end of his first term, largely by increasing taxes on the wealthy and withdrawing troops from Iraq. 
 While the presidential address will be threaded with themes of optimism, in part to counter some criticism that Mr. Obama has been ''talking down'' the economy, aides said his words would reflect the harsh reality of the challenges facing the country.
 ''This is a speech to look forward, not back,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''The country is looking for a clear sense of direction. This is an opportunity to talk to the nation about that.''

HEADLINE: Governors' Fight Over Stimulus May Define G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and J. DAVID GOODMAN; Robert Pear reported from Washington, and J. David Goodman from New York. Jackie Calmes and Brian Knowlton contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Republican governors split sharply over the weekend over how to respond to the economic crisis, a debate whose outcome will go a long way toward shaping how the national party redefines itself in the wake of its election defeats of recent years.
 While the $787 billion stimulus bill might help avert draconian budget cuts by deeply stressed states, Republican governors clashed over just how much of the stimulus money to accept. And governors of both parties said that they did not expect to see signs of recovery until late this year or early 2010.
The governors, in Washington for the winter meeting of the National Governors Association, have been poring over the new stimulus law, which cuts taxes and provides billions of dollars to the states for education, transportation, Medicaid and energy and environmental projects.
 For some -- mostly Democrats but also a few prominent moderate Republicans -- the bill represents an admittedly imperfect but desperately needed infusion of cash that will help them avert thousands of layoffs. 
 For others -- predominantly conservative Southern Republicans -- the flaws partly outweigh the benefits. And for those with presidential aspirations, the strong stance in opposition to the Obama administration may be seen as a way to stand out and stake a claim to leadership.
 With state budgets teetering, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, one of the moderates and a supporter of the stimulus bill, emphasized the need for Republicans in state houses and in Congress to be ''team players'' in facing the economic crisis and not to be bound unduly by party orthodoxies. 
 ''You've got to go beyond just the principles,'' he told George Stephanapolous on ABC's ''This Week.''
 Florida Governor Charlie Crist, also a Republican, voiced a similar sentiment on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' where he urged Republican to give President Obama ''a shot.''
 ''I think he's on the right track,'' Mr. Crist said. 
 On Saturday, Governor Crist said that while Florida would receive $12.2 billion over three years as a result of the stimulus law, ''We still have declining revenues and have to cut the budget.''
 Another group of Republican governors, including possible contenders for the 2012 presidential nomination, have denounced the stimulus as a bloated behemoth. A handful of them caused a stir by saying they would turn down some of the federal money.
 Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana said he opposed spending federal money because it would require permanent changes in state law. ''It would be like spending a dollar to make a dime,'' Governor Jindal said on ''Meet the Press.'' ''I just have a fundamental disagreement with this package.''
 Mr. Jindal, a rising star in the party since being elected governor in 2007, said he would take advantage of one stimulus provision to increase unemployment benefits by $25 a week, financed entirely with federal money. But he said he would not accept money to expand eligibility for unemployment because it would increase employer taxes. 
 Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour, like Mr. Jindal, said that he would reject the money for expanding unemployment insurance.
 ''There is some we will not take in Mississippi,'' Governor Barbour told CNN's ''State of the Union'' on Sunday. ''We want more jobs. You don't get more jobs by putting an extra tax on creating jobs.''
 In an interview on Saturday, Mr. Barbour criticized the stimulus law, saying: ''It's filled with social policy and costs too much. You could create just as many jobs for about half as much money.''
 Mr. Jindal and Mr. Barbour both said that they would accept funding for transportation projects. 
 State and local Democratic leaders were quick to pounce on those governors opposing stimulus money, seeing their resistance as a political liability for Republicans in cash- strapped states. 
 ''We'll take it,'' said Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''We'll take your money.''
 Nathan Daschle, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, said over the weekend: ''If Republican governors do not want this money, Democratic governors will put it to good use.''
 At least one Republican agreed with the Democrats.
 ''I'm more than happy to take his money or any other governor in this country that doesn't want to take this money,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said in response to South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, who also said he would reject a portion of the stimulus money: ''I take it, because we in California can need it.''
 ''
 Mr. Douglas, the vice chairman of the National Governors Association, played down the split among Republicans. On Saturday, he predicted that most Republican governors would, in the end, accept most of the federal money.
 ''You can philosophize in D.C. all you want, but we in the states have to get things done,'' Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said on Saturday. ''A governor's job is to deliver for people: to create good jobs, to keep criminals in prison, to educate children, to make sure we have decent roads. This recovery package does that.''
 Moreover, Mr. Schweitzer said: ''It's a little late for Republican governors to get high-minded about accepting federal dollars. This recovery legislation represents only a small share of all the federal money states receive.''
 Governors in both parties said that state revenues were coming in far below their projections and that the stimulus money, while helpful, would not be a panacea.
 Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. of Utah, where the economy is better than in most states, said the revenue figures were ''still dismal.''
 Asked when the recovery would start, Mr. Huntsman, a Republican, said: ''We were hoping in the fourth quarter of this year. But I think many are pushing it now into 2010.''
 Gov. Steven L. Beshear of Kentucky, a Democrat, said: ''If the experts are correct, next year may be even worse than this year. I think very probably they are correct.''
 Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington, a Democrat, said: ''The recovery will be very, very slow. We are the most trade-dependent state in the nation. Since November, I've lost $4.2 billion of projected revenues in a $32 billion budget. We fell off a cliff.''
 The chairman of the governors association, Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, said he had not seen any hint of a recovery, ''not yet.''
 Based on revenue estimates in the middle of last year, Mr. Rendell said, he had expected a $1.6 billion deficit. But because of plunging state revenues, he said, he increased his deficit forecast to $2 billion and then last month to $2.3 billion. Likewise, Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri, a Democrat, said, ''We've seen a huge dip in revenues.''
 But the economic crisis had created an opportunity, Mr. Nixon added. 
 ''We will use the new federal money to transform the economy,'' he said, ''to build not just roads and bridges, but also human capital, investing in education and job retraining.''
 On Tuesday, President Obama will deliver a State of the Union-like speech, outlining his domestic and foreign policy agenda to a joint session of Congress. According to Reuters, Mr. Obama is expected to echo the theme of personal sacrifice that was central to hisinaugural address. On Thursday, the administration is expected to announce its plans to slash the federal budget deficit.

HEADLINE: A Clinton Listening Tour, But China Gets an Earful

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton said she wanted to spend her first trip as secretary of state listening. But she ended up saying a lot, and in blunter terms, than many of her pinstriped predecessors.
 The Clinton Straight Talk Express made its last big stop in Beijing on Sunday, with Mrs. Clinton explaining to a Chinese talk show host why China had better keep buying United States Treasury bonds.
 ''It's a good investment, it's a safe investment,'' she told Yang Lan, the host of a show on Dragon Television. 
 The Chinese government, she said, has an even more compelling incentive to keep buying: it needs the United States to recover as a market for Chinese goods. To jolt the economy back to life, she added, the United States needs to be able to take on more debt. 
 ''We are truly going to rise or fall together,'' she said. ''We are in the same boat and, thankfully, we are rowing in the same direction.'' Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner could not have said it better.
 Speaking of Mr. Geithner, Mrs. Clinton cleared up the question of how the two of them were going to divide China policy. Speculation about who would control China policy has crackled since it became clear she was not ready to cede it to the Treasury Department, as happened during the Bush administration.
 Mrs. Clinton said she and Mr. Geithner would share leadership of a high-level consultation between China and the United States that would be balanced between strategic issues like North Korea and economic concerns.
 Before leaving Beijing, Mrs. Clinton met with female lawyers, doctors and academics. It is the kind of encounter she has thrived on since she was first lady, and she has been a heroine in this circle since her famous speech to a women's conference in Beijing in 1995.
 One woman spoke of posing with a wax figure of Mrs. Clinton on a trip to the United States. Several had met her before, and they could not resist commiserating with her about her presidential campaign.
 Xie Lihua, the founder of a group that represents rural women, said she memorized the words ''I hope you win'' for a meeting with Mrs. Clinton last year. When she shook her hand then, Ms. Xie was so nervous that she blanked on the words. ''If I had said it, you probably would have won,'' she said.
 In Obama's Town
 There was little chance of Mrs. Clinton's forgetting the campaign when she landed in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital. Waiting for her on the tarmac was a group of children from the school President Obama attended when he lived in Indonesia as a boy. They serenaded her under a stormy tropical sky.
 After a meeting with the foreign minister, Hassan Wirajuda, the subject of when Mr. Obama might visit came up. ''We cannot wait too long, and I wish Hillary Clinton would convey this to President Obama,'' he said.
 At dinner on Wednesday night, Mrs. Clinton joked about how many people had asked her the same question. The next morning, she said she had spoken to Mr. Obama by phone and passed along the requests. The word is Mr. Obama might make it to Indonesia in the fall. 
 Tea With the Empress
 After 16 years on the world stage, there is little in the way of pomp and ceremony that can dazzle Mrs. Clinton. In Tokyo, she was invited to a formal tea with Empress Michiko, who accorded her the very rare honor of emerging from the cloistered imperial residence to greet her.
 Clasping Mrs. Clinton's left arm and drawing her close, Empress Michiko spoke in English to her guest, her eyes sparkling. As they went inside, photographers were ordered to stop their clicking, one of many rules that keep the imperial family at a strict remove from ordinary society.
 Yet at a town hall meeting at the University of Tokyo, Mrs. Clinton talked about the visit as though it had been just a couple of old pals catching up. Noting that she first met the empress 15 years ago, Mrs. Clinton said, ''We were both saying we had gotten older.'' This, she said, led to a discussion of how caretaking for the elderly could become a growth industry in Japan.
 A Familiar Feel in the Air
 There were times when the secretary's plane felt more like a campaign charter, hopping between a state fair in Jakarta and a stump speech in Seoul, South Korea. Mrs. Clinton brought along a coterie of aides from her campaign and the White House, giving the diplomatic mission a distinctly political flavor.
 Lissa Muscatine, a longtime aide, was busy writing speeches. Kiki McLean, a veteran Democratic Party strategist who is helping Mrs. Clinton on a transitional basis, trooped back to the press section to chat up reporters and dole out good-natured spin.
 Huma Abedin, Mrs. Clinton's aide-de-camp and ubiquitous seatmate during the campaign, was never more than a few steps away from her boss. Ms. Abedin even accompanied Mrs. Clinton to her tea with Empress Michiko, though she was guided to an antechamber to wait.
 Even the itinerary had the flavor of a campaign. On the way home to Washington, Mrs. Clinton's plane landed at Yokota Air Base in Japan to refuel, and she squeezed in a pep talk to about 350 Marines and airmen.
 Speaking in a hangar under a giant American flag, flanked by two helicopters, Mrs. Clinton reported on her trip and praised the troops for being ''on the front lines of defense.'' Then she worked the crowd.

HEADLINE: Banking on the Brink

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Comrade Greenspan wants us to seize the economy's commanding heights.
 O.K., not exactly. What Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman -- and a staunch defender of free markets -- actually said was, ''It may be necessary to temporarily nationalize some banks in order to facilitate a swift and orderly restructuring.'' I agree. 
 The case for nationalization rests on three observations. 
 First, some major banks are dangerously close to the edge -- in fact, they would have failed already if investors didn't expect the government to rescue them if necessary.
 Second, banks must be rescued. The collapse of Lehman Brothers almost destroyed the world financial system, and we can't risk letting much bigger institutions like Citigroup or Bank of America implode.
 Third, while banks must be rescued, the U.S. government can't afford, fiscally or politically, to bestow huge gifts on bank shareholders.
 Let's be concrete here. There's a reasonable chance -- not a certainty -- that Citi and BofA, together, will lose hundreds of billions over the next few years. And their capital, the excess of their assets over their liabilities, isn't remotely large enough to cover those potential losses. 
 Arguably, the only reason they haven't already failed is that the government is acting as a backstop, implicitly guaranteeing their obligations. But they're zombie banks, unable to supply the credit the economy needs.
 To end their zombiehood the banks need more capital. But they can't raise more capital from private investors. So the government has to supply the necessary funds. 
 But here's the thing: the funds needed to bring these banks fully back to life would greatly exceed what they're currently worth. Citi and BofA have a combined market value of less than $30 billion, and even that value is mainly if not entirely based on the hope that stockholders will get a piece of a government handout. And if it's basically putting up all the money, the government should get ownership in return.
 Still, isn't nationalization un-American? No, it's as American as apple pie.
 Lately the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has been seizing banks it deems insolvent at the rate of about two a week. When the F.D.I.C. seizes a bank, it takes over the bank's bad assets, pays off some of its debt, and resells the cleaned-up institution to private investors. And that's exactly what advocates of temporary nationalization want to see happen, not just to the small banks the F.D.I.C. has been seizing, but to major banks that are similarly insolvent. 
 The real question is why the Obama administration keeps coming up with proposals that sound like possible alternatives to nationalization, but turn out to involve huge handouts to bank stockholders.
 For example, the administration initially floated the idea of offering banks guarantees against losses on troubled assets. This would have been a great deal for bank stockholders, not so much for the rest of us: heads they win, tails taxpayers lose.
 Now the administration is talking about a ''public-private partnership'' to buy troubled assets from the banks, with the government lending money to private investors for that purpose. This would offer investors a one-way bet: if the assets rise in price, investors win; if they fall substantially, investors walk away and leave the government holding the bag. Again, heads they win, tails we lose.
 Why not just go ahead and nationalize? Remember, the longer we live with zombie banks, the harder it will be to end the economic crisis.
 How would nationalization take place? All the administration has to do is take its own planned ''stress test'' for major banks seriously, and not hide the results when a bank fails the test, making a takeover necessary. Yes, the whole thing would have a Claude Rains feel to it, as a government that has been propping up banks for months declares itself shocked, shocked at the miserable state of their balance sheets. But that's O.K.
 And once again, long-term government ownership isn't the goal: like the small banks seized by the F.D.I.C. every week, major banks would be returned to private control as soon as possible. The finance blog Calculated Risk suggests that instead of calling the process nationalization, we should call it ''preprivatization.''
 The Obama administration, says Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, believes ''that a privately held banking system is the correct way to go.'' So do we all. But what we have now isn't private enterprise, it's lemon socialism: banks get the upside but taxpayers bear the risks. And it's perpetuating zombie banks, blocking economic recovery.
 What we want is a system in which banks own the downs as well as the ups. And the road to that system runs through nationalization.

HEADLINE: Presidential Fiscal Pivot Comes Early This Time

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Every recent president has pressed his economic agenda before a joint session of Congress in February of his first year. Every one later adjusted policy gears to changing circumstances -- but none as quickly as President Obama will this week. 
 On Feb. 18, 1981, President Ronald Reagan told lawmakers that ''the ship of state'' was ''somewhat out of control'' because of high inflation, interest rates and joblessness. It took until August to enact his signature tax cuts. A year later, Mr. Reagan zagged by signing tax increases to curb mounting deficits. 
 On Feb. 9, 1989, President George Bush told Congress he would not reverse Mr. Reagan's course because ''we're headed the right way.'' Within 21 months, he had enraged conservatives by jettisoning his ''read my lips'' pledge and compromising with Congressional Democrats on deficit-cutting tax increases.
 On Feb. 17, 1993, President Bill Clinton proposed ''a new direction'' synthesizing left and right after defeating Mr. Bush. He called for a $30 billion stimulus package and other government ''investments,'' along with spending cuts and tax increases. Congressional Republicans blocked the stimulus and forced Mr. Clinton to scale back his domestic ambitions when they won control of Congress in 1994.
 On Feb. 27, 2001, after inheriting a budget surplus from Mr. Clinton, President George W. Bush declared that ''taxes are too high.'' Summarizing his free-market philosophy, Mr. Bush said, ''Too much government crowds out initiative and hard work, private charity and the private economy.''
 Mr. Bush's most profound reversal came as the economy deteriorated in his final months in office. Last fall, despite a budget that had long since fallen into deficit, he backed a $700 billion federal bailout for troubled financial firms and opened the door to the most expansive government intervention in the financial system in generations.
 Mr. Obama got barely a month into his term before he began a pivot of his own: from a period in which the fiscal floodgates were opened to accommodate emergency economic measures to one in which the focus is more on budget discipline and long-term restraint.
 Mr. Obama can argue that his new pledge to cut the deficit in half by 2013 marks no shift at all. In an interview last month, he vowed to pursue the stimulus and spending restraint on ''a parallel track.''
 Discordance
 But the ''fiscal responsibility summit'' he will convene on Monday before his speech to Congress the next day seems a political world apart from persuading lawmakers to dish out stimulus money as rapidly as possible. The discordance cost Mr. Obama the services of Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who abandoned his nomination as commerce secretary largely because he could not abide the stimulus package, which he called ''a waste of money.'' 
 As a freshman House member, Mr. Gregg sat in the audience 28 years ago when Mr. Reagan described the $1 trillion national debt as ''a stack of thousand-dollar bills 67 miles high.'' With the debt now at $10.8 trillion, that stack would exceed 700 miles. To protect America's currency and its borrowing capacity, Mr. Gregg said in an interview, ''the world has to be told that we're going to be fiscally disciplined in the out years.''
 Curbing Entitlements
 Efforts to tame long-run entitlement spending may find more Republican support than Mr. Obama achieved on the stimulus. ''He has extremely fertile ground in the Senate,'' Mr. Gregg said, crediting the president's early outreach and ''courageous position of saying the can's been kicked down the road long enough.''
 Indeed, Mr. Gregg, who will attend the fiscal responsibility meeting, predicted that the White House and Congress could strike a quick deal for Social Security solvency by packaging familiar adjustments that might include subjecting more income to payroll taxes, revising benefit formulas and raising the retirement age. ''He could probably do it before June,'' Mr. Gregg said, and then begin shoring up Medicare.
 Congressional Democrats do not plan Social Security action nearly that rapidly. Obama advisers say the administration plans to tackle Medicare first in the health care debate later this year.
 But the speech Tuesday will underscore that, in the understated phrasing of David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, ''there's a lot more work to be done.''

HEADLINE: Obama Finds Resistance in His Party on Addressing Social Security

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama is eager to seek a bipartisan solution to ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security, people who have spoken with him say, but he is running into opposition from his party's left and from Democratic Congressional leaders who contend that his political capital would be better spent on health care and other priorities. 
 Mr. Obama considered announcing the formation of a Social Security task force at a White House ''fiscal responsibility summit'' that he will convene on Monday. But several Democrats said that idea had been shelved, partly because of objections from House and Senate leaders. 
 The president signaled in his campaign that he would support addressing the retirement system's looming financing shortfall, in part by applying payroll taxes to incomes above $250,000. But that would ignite intense opposition from Republicans, especially with the economy deep in recession. 
 Liberal Democrats are already serving notice that they will be equally vehement in opposing any reductions in scheduled benefits for future retirees. But any solution, budget analysts said, must include a mix of both approaches, though current beneficiaries would see no change. 
 Despite the long-running partisan divide over benefits and taxes, the advocates for a compromise see an opportunity now given the fact that the stock markets' slide has discredited the idea of carving private accounts from Social Security. Former President George W. Bush demanded such accounts as the centerpiece of any compromise, while Democrats and some Republicans were just as adamantly opposed, dooming his effort in 2005.
 ''The carve-out account is off the table,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has long sought a deal.
 This month, Mr. Obama unexpectedly approached Mr. Graham when he was at the White House to meet with Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff. Mr. Graham, who was a vocal foe of Mr. Obama's $787 billion stimulus plan, said in an interview: ''I know he's sincere about wanting to do something about entitlements generally, health care and Social Security. And I want to help him.''
 Despite Mr. Obama's interest, his political and policy advisers are divided, with most arguing that taking on Social Security would overload a legislative system already strained by the economy and war. 
 Within the administration, ''the question is whether it helps you in moving the rest of the agenda or hurts you,'' said John D. Podesta, an informal adviser to Mr. Obama and former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton who is now head of the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning research group.
 Mr. Podesta is among those arguing for action sooner rather than later. ''What this crisis has proven,'' he said, ''is that we need to have a basic benefit that keeps people out of poverty, and that we need to work at both ends -- toward fiscal sustainability and toward ensuring that people, particularly at the bottom, have an adequate benefit.'' 
 For some Democrats, another reason to act is that with their party in control of the White House and Congress, they are positioned to produce a solution more to their liking. And while neither the changes nor the fiscal benefits would take effect soon, a compromise would send a reassuring signal to markets and to foreign investors who worry about the nation's huge looming liabilities for promised social benefits, advocates said.
 Those who oppose action said Mr. Obama must focus on his bigger priority -- health care legislation to expand access to insurance and reduce the costs of care. They argue that success there would help control the unsustainable growth of Medicare and Medicaid, the government's other major benefit programs, which together pose a far greater fiscal problem.
 Social Security still runs a surplus, and its reserves will not be exhausted until 2041, after which enough payroll taxes will come in to cover 78 percent of benefits, according to the 2008 annual report of the program trustees. Medicare, by contrast, requires big infusions from general revenues each year; its hospital trust fund is already running annual deficits and will be exhausted by 2019.
 The problems of both programs, as well as those of Medicaid, are sharpened as the huge generation born between 1946 and 1964 reaches retirement age. While presidents have grappled with Social Security for three decades, Mr. Obama comes to office just as the first of those 77 million Americans are turning 62, making them eligible for early retirement benefits. Most Americans claim early benefits, which are slightly reduced, rather than waiting until age 66 for full benefits.
 ''What we have done is kicked this can down the road. We are now at the end of the road and are not in a position to kick it any further,'' Mr. Obama said days before his inauguration. ''We have to signal seriousness in this by making sure some of the hard decisions are made under my watch, not someone else's.''
 Likewise, Mr. Bush often said that he would not leave big problems like the finances of Social Security to a future president. Yet warnings of a coming crisis like the one he sounded four years ago pale against the economic crisis at hand, many Democrats said.
 Social Security ''was a critical issue before we got into this crisis,'' Representative Ellen O. Tauscher, a California Democrat and chairwoman of the New Democrats coalition of House moderates, said in an interview. ''Now it's one of those things -- the question is, is it a nice-to-have or a have-to-have?'' She said she would favor having a bipartisan group take up the issue and devise a plan ''that doesn't get delivered until perhaps a year from now.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 24, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the political debate over the long-term solvency of Social Security misstated the age at which new retirees may begin to collect full benefits. Under the current formula, a person born between 1943 and 1954 must be 66 years old -- not 65 -- to receive full monthly benefits.

HEADLINE: Big Opening for 'Madea' Lifts a Struggling Studio

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Finally, some good news for Lionsgate: The studio, under pressure from investors to turn around its slumping movie division, opened ''Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail'' to a record-setting $41.1 million in sales at domestic theaters. 
 The movie, the latest to star Mr. Perry in drag as a gun-toting grandmother, easily delivered the best opening-weekend results in Lionsgate's 12-year history, said Steve Rothenberg, president for distribution. ''Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail'' also marks a high-water point for Mr. Perry, opening with 35 percent more sales than ''Tyler Perry's Madea's Family Reunion'' in 2006, the previous installment of the franchise.
''Tyler greatly improved the percentage of young people who attended and the number of Hispanic ticket buyers,'' Mr. Rothenberg said. ''We are extremely pleased.''
 Despite the best efforts of Lionsgate marketers to broaden Mr. Perry's audience to white moviegoers -- still the sweet spot of the North American box office -- patrons for the picture, featuring a predominantly African-American cast, were only 6 percent white. That percentage is on a par with Mr. Perry's previous films, Mr. Rothenberg said.
 Lionsgate's releases have, for the most part, performed poorly in recent months despite a surge in moviegoing, leading the company recently to report a quarterly net loss of $93.4 million. Complicating matters, Carl C. Icahn, feared for his reputation as a corporate raider, has more than doubled his stake in the company over the past year, to about 13 percent. Mr. Icahn has not publicly indicated his intentions. Peter Wilkes, a studio spokesman, said, ''Mr. Icahn has a superb track record for finding value, and we welcome his continued investment and support.''
 Over all, multiplexes continued to be jammed, with ticket sales for the weekend 33 percent higher than last year (to $119.8 million) and 23 percent higher in year-to-date results (to $1.65 billion), according to Media by Numbers, a box-office tracking firm. Hollywood executives point to the economic downturn as the primary reason, arguing that moviegoing is still a mostly affordable form of entertainment.
 The thriller ''Taken,'' from the director Pierre Morel and starring Liam Neeson, also delivered a notable box-office performance over the weekend. The 20th Century Fox picture has shown remarkable staying power, capturing the No. 2 slot in its fourth weekend in release with an estimated $11.4 million in sales ($95.2 million over all), according to Media by Numbers.
 The animated picture ''Coraline'' from Focus Features was third with an estimated $11 million ($53.4 million). The Warner Brothers comedy ''He's Just Not That Into You'' came in fourth with an estimated $8.5 million ($70.1 million). ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' from Fox Searchlight Pictures, was fifth with $8.1 million.

HEADLINE: That Old Master? It's Down at the Pawnshop

BYLINE: By ALLEN SALKIN

 BODY:
Last fall, Annie Leibovitz, the photographer, borrowed $5 million from a company called Art Capital Group. In December, she borrowed $10.5 million more from the same firm. As collateral, among other items, she used town houses she owns in Greenwich Village, a country house, and something else: the rights to all of her photographs.
In other words, according to loan documents filed with the city, one of the world's most successful photographers essentially pawned every snap of the shutter she had made or will make until the loans are paid off.
Those who know Ms. Leibovitz said she used the money to pay off mortgages and deal with other financial stresses. But whatever her reasons, she is not alone in doing business with Art Capital and similar lenders. At a time when stock portfolios are plunging and many homes, even grand ones, have no equity left to borrow against, an increasing number of art owners are realizing that an Old Master or a prime photograph, when used as collateral, can bring in much-needed cash. 
''It's very discreet,'' said Ian Peck, a co-owner of Art Capital.
This little-known corner of the art business is lightly regulated and highly litigious. But this has not dissuaded clients who have included rich collectors like Veronica Hearst, art galleries and prominent artists themselves, including Ms. Leibovitz and Julian Schnabel.
Art Capital's headquarters in the former Sotheby's building on Madison Avenue looks at first glance like an art gallery. Two Warhols, a pair of Rubens portraits of Roman emperors and a pink nude by the contemporary Mexican painter Victor Rodriguez hang on the cool white walls. A sculpture of a faun by Rembrandt Bugatti sits on a windowsill in a conference room where transactions are discussed.
But it would be more accurate to describe the airy space as something far less genteel: a pawnshop.
Art Capital issues loans of $500,000 or more at interest rates from 6 percent to 16 percent. Fail to pay and you lose your Rubens; several of the works on display in Art Capital's office on Madison became subject to sale after their owners defaulted.
The company expects to make about $120 million in art-related loans in 2009, up from $80 million in 2008. At a Manhattan-based competitor, Art Finance Partners, ''we are up 40 percent in originations in the last six months,'' said Meghan Carleton, a partner.
ArtLoan, a similar company in San Francisco, is actually regulated by California's pawn laws. It opened in 2004 and has seen ''exponential'' growth in the last year even though it charges interest rates of 18 percent to 24 percent, said Ray Parker Gaylord, an owner.
''It's a very rough-and-tumble corner of the business,'' said Marc Porter, who heads the American operations of Christie's auction house. Christie's and Sotheby's also offer loans against fine art but focus on bridge loans to customers who have pledged their art for planned auctions.
''For years, one of the reasons this wasn't an especially big business is that everyone was getting money for something else,'' Mr. Porter said. ''It was easy money everywhere. But now people are looking to every asset they have to unlock cash.''
ArtLoan prefers to make loans on items that are physically small and thus easy to store or to ship to auction houses and dealers in case of a default. A recent loan was for $115,000 against a collection that included an early 20th-century bronze sculpture, a 19th-century Persian carpet and a Swiss music box.
Art lenders typically lend up to 40 percent of what they appraise the artworks to be worth, and usually take possession of the works.
A former investment banker in New York, who spoke anonymously because he did not want friends to know his financial situation, is sending six modern paintings to ArtLoan, hoping to borrow $50,000 against them to finance a business venture. His former company's stock, which he was given as part of his annual bonuses, has gone from the high $70s a share to $22, he said.
''At this point, I've been not working for a year and a half,'' he said. ''I have a choice, which is sell part of my art collection, which when I first left my job in 2007 was an option because the art market was strong, but like all markets it has gone south. Now I can take a loan without having to sell at a discount.''
For her $5 million loan, Ms. Leibovitz put up as collateral a country house in Rhinebeck, N.Y., three town houses in Greenwich Village and all ''copyrights ... photographic negatives ... contract rights'' existing or to be created in the future, according to a loan document filed with the City Register's Office in December. That month, Art Capital granted her an additional $10.5 million loan, which was to consolidate the existing mortgages on her homes, according to loan documents.
Ms. Leibovitz appears to have experienced financial challenges in recent years, facing a lengthy, costly and litigious renovation on the three adjoining town houses, federal and state tax liens of more than $1.4 million -- which appear to have been paid back -- and lawsuits from a lighting company and a stylist she had hired, asking for a total of more than $700,000.
Ms. Leibovitz, one of the most successful editorial and commercial photographers in the business, declined to comment on the reasons for the loans. In a brief e-mail message, she said her financial health was ''fine.''
Robert Pledge, the founder of Contact Press Images, which represents Ms. Leibovitz's editorial work, said she had faced many stresses in the last eight years, including runaway expenses at her Chelsea studio, which she has since closed; the renovations; the deaths of her lover Susan Sontag and her parents; and the birth of three children.
The Warhols hanging at Art Capital, one an acrylic and silkscreen image of a hamburger called ''Hamburger,'' the other called ''Mineola Motorcycle,'' once hung in the collection of Evan Tawil, a manufacturer of children's clothing. Mr. Tawil said he had seen a small advertisement for Art Capital posted outside the Madison Avenue entrance of the Carlyle hotel (''Private Banking for the Art World'') and thought he could leverage his collection to buy more art.
''I knew I had money coming in,'' said Mr. Tawil, who said he borrowed about $250,000 from Art Capital in 2007. ''I had receivables, but the buys I wanted to make were time-sensitive.''
Mr. Tawil's lawyer, John Cahill, said that when Mr. Tawil's loan term ended with his having made his interest payments in a timely fashion, he asked if Art Capital would release his paintings so he could auction them to pay off the principal, but the company refused.
The Rubens once belonged to Veronica Hearst, the widow of Randolph Apperson Hearst. As detailed in an article in Vanity Fair in December, Ms. Hearst had mortgaged her artworks in an effort to hold on to a 52-room mansion in Manalapan, Fla., which she eventually lost in foreclosure.
Mr. Schnabel, the artist and film director, turned to Art Capital for an $8 million loan in 2006, when he was constructing Palazzo Chupi, an ornate apartment project on West 11th Street. He used only the real estate and not his own art collection as collateral. (To pay down that debt, Mr. Schnabel later took out a loan with Commerce Bank, for which he did pledge his personal art collection, documents filed with New York State show.)
Mr. Schnabel is now suing Art Capital, claiming that he paid back his loan in a timely fashion but that Art Capital tried to add exorbitant fees. Art Capital counterclaims that it is entitled to millions of dollars in additional interest and fees because Mr. Schnabel did not reveal there was an existing mortgage on the property.
Citing client confidentiality, Art Capital declined to discuss specific loans, but Baird Ryan, a co-owner, explained that because his firm understands the art market better than regular banks, artists can make attractive borrowers. ''We say, 'Hey, you're a bankable asset,' '' Mr. Ryan said. ''So we encumber their own art.''
None of the legal messiness is surprising given the nature of the business, said Gerald Peters, an art dealer in Santa Fe, N.M., who said he had bought paintings from Art Capital. ''The game they have to play is rough,'' he said. ''But the service they are providing is real, and there's demand for it.''
Mr. Peck said the vast majority of Art Capital's customers repaid their loans and were satisfied with the company's services.
''The nature of this business is you find yourself having to enforce your rights in court from time to time,'' he said.
Mr. Ryan, who met Mr. Peck when they were children spending their summers in Southampton, N.Y., said he expected business to get better. In an interview in the company's office, Mr. Ryan held up his BlackBerry, showing that he had just gotten two e-mail messages with queries about how much Art Capital could lend on collections of modern art.
''The town house, there's no equity behind it, the house at the beach is at half or a third of what they had it valued at last year,'' he said. ''All of a sudden, the art becomes a very important asset.''
Correction: March 3, 2009, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Tuesday about Art Capital Group, a company that lends money to artists, collectors and gallery owners using artwork as collateral, misstated the surname of one of the company's owners at two points. He is Baird Ryan, not ''Mr. Baird.''

HEADLINE: Buyers Flee As S.&P. And Dow Hit 12-Year Lows

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
On a day when two leading stock indexes sank to their lowest point in more than a decade, Wall Street did not need the dire problems of banks to lead the way to the bottom.
A broad sell-off on Monday sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling 250.89 points and pulled the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its lowest close since April 1997. In the last five trading days, stocks have fallen about 10 percent.
Unlike in recent weeks, financial stocks did not post the biggest declines. In fact, battered shares of Citigroup and Bank of America ended higher as the government moved closer toward taking direct ownership stakes in troubled banks. 
But the losses piled up everywhere else, providing few signs that would indicate the end of the bear market. Stocks of technology companies, including Intel, Google and I.B.M. fell, as did scores of retailers, manufacturers and media companies. The materials sector -- makers of raw materials like aluminum, chemicals and plastics -- declined the most among the 10 major industries in the S.& P. 500.
The deepening global downturn is dragging down businesses across every sector of the economy, and analysts said the sell-off was a sign that investors were simply pulling up their stakes.
''Some just hit the point where they'd had enough and they just needed to be out,'' said Bill Schultz, chief investment officer at McQueen Ball & Associates, an advisory firm in Bethlehem, Pa. ''At this point there are not a lot of buyers. They've had enough.''
Stock markets fell more than 6 percent last week on worries about the solvency of the country's banks.
On Monday morning, the Treasury Department tried to reassure nervous investors with a message supporting the financial system that laid out details of the coming ''stress tests'' of major banks.
But after a brief rise in early trading, stock indexes fell into the red and sank lower throughout the afternoon.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 250.89 points, or 3.41 percent, to 7.114.78, hitting a point not seen since May 7, 1997.
Of the Dow's 30 blue-chip stocks, only Bank of America, Citigroup and General Motors did not close lower.
Shares of Bank of America rose 12 cents, or 3.17 percent, to $3.91; Citigroup was up 19 cents, or 9.74 percent, to $2.14; while G.M. was flat at $1.77.
The broader S.& P. 500 fell 26.72 points, or 3.47 percent, to 743.33.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index declined 53.51 points, or 3.71 percent, to 1,387.72.
With the losses on Monday, two of the major indexes erased the three months of fitful gains they had made since Nov. 20. (The Nasdaq is still above its late November lows).
Analysts said that the draining cycle of losses, rebounds and more losses would probably continue until the government offered a detailed plan to bail out the banks or the economy showed some signs of stabilization.
''In lieu of anything the market sees as positive, it's going to continue its easiest path, and the path it sees is down,'' said Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading, based in Chatham, N.J. ''That's where we're stuck right now, and who's going to get out in front of it?''
Analysts said that after fevered speculation last week about bank nationalization, many investors expected the government to move in that direction, despite statements from the White House supporting a privately held banking system.
Now, with the government set to begin the ''stress tests'' on Wednesday, investors want to know which banks will be deemed healthy and which will not, analysts said.
''We need to know how they stand right now,'' said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams, a financial services firm. ''The uncertainty of waiting for the results of these stress test is just killing the markets.''
Two weeks ago, stock markets tumbled after the Treasury Department announced plans to form a public-private partnership to take troubled mortgage-related assets off the balance sheets of banks. Investors said the government's plans were short on details and left too much uncertainty about how those assets would be valued, or how private investors would be enticed to bid on them.
''There is a total lack of confidence in Washington to do anything to get us out of this problem,'' said Ryan Detrick, senior technical analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''It's a never-ending cycle.''
Crude oil fell $1.59, to $38.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Gold prices, which have risen as investors seek a safe-haven for their money, also fell slightly, to $991.75 an ounce.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 9/32, to 99 31/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 2.75 percent, from 2.79 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: At Home Onstage, and Inspired by an Older School

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
Harriet Halloway, 23, a burlesque dancer turned actress and comedian, has been performing stand-up in New York City comedy clubs for two years.
Hometown: The Upper East Side.
Parents' odd jobs: My dad is a mortician. He owns a chain of funeral homes. My mom's a yoga teacher. She owns a spa and yoga retreat in Long Island. It's called American Yogini. She's super New-Agey.
Prowess, or lack thereof, at school: Basically I got straight F's. I hated anybody in authority. But I was always trying to make people laugh. 
Teenage antics: I would sneak out of my house as a kid and go to burlesque clubs in the Lower East Side and hang out with old people. That's how I got into comedy. I was backstage talking, and from there people found out that I was funny. Someone said, ''Why don't you host a show?'' And I did, at the Slipper Room. The moment I got on stage I realized: ''This is it.''
Current abode: I inherited some money, and I'm now a homeowner. I live by myself in an apartment in Gramercy Park. I love it because it's old and cool.
Idols: W. C. Fields. I love that old stuff. Rosalind Russell. Lucille Ball, obviously. Carol Burnett. And Goldie Hawn. That's a big one, she's just kind of everything to me. I always really related with her. Big eyes, big dreams, and she's dizzy. It's difficult being blonde in this world.
Gigs: Broadway Comedy Club, New York Comedy Club, Carolines, Gotham Comedy Club. Sometimes I get $100. Sometimes I don't get paid at all. I do an average of three or four shows a week.
Worst audience member: I was doing a show, and in the middle of it someone's phone went off. And they picked up and started talking!
Future roles: I'm in two movies. I'm so excited. One is called ''The Louisiana Conversation.'' It's a horror movie about all these women vampires who all fall in love with each other and kill everyone. The other one is untitled. It's a short film where everyone in it is a comedian. I play a stripper.
Any real-life experience? Well, I did burlesque. You do things like lowering a shoulder strap, taking a glove off with your teeth and twirling tassels. I was taught by Dirty Martini and World Famous Bob, who are pretty much the biggest burlesque performers right now. They taught me everything I know and took me under their wing.
Shoe count: Over a hundred pairs. Two of them are flats. I'd rather starve than have bad shoes. I sound like Carrie Bradshaw. How nauseating.
Time grooming before a show: Two hours.
Must-have accessory: False eyelashes. I have a drawerful that looks like a drawer full of spiders. I shriek every time I open it. A lot of my comedy is about me reacting to my material. The more expressive the eyes, the better.
Dream role: I want to play Martha in ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' Because she's a salty old alcoholic like I hope to be one day.
Has the economy shrunk audiences? It has a little bit, but this past month hasn't been that bad. Friends and people still come out and see a show. People need to laugh now more than ever.

HEADLINE: Ailing Industries Pressing To Add Billions to Bailouts

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Eric Dash and Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

 BODY:
This article is by Edmund L. Andrews, Andrew Ross Sorkin and Mary Williams Walsh.
The government faced mounting pressure on Monday to put billions more in some of the nation's biggest banks, two of the biggest automakers and the biggest insurance company, despite the billions it has already committed to rescuing them.
The government's boldest rescue to date, its $150 billion commitment for the insurance giant American International Group, is foundering. A.I.G. indicated on Monday it was now negotiating for tens of billions of dollars in additional assistance as losses have mounted.
Separately, the Obama administration confirmed it was in discussions to aid Citigroup, the recipient of $45 billion so far, that could raise the government's stake in the banking company to as much as 40 percent. 
The Treasury Department named a special adviser to work with General Motors and Chrysler, two of Detroit's biggest automakers, which are seeking $22 billion on top of the $17 billion already granted to them.
All these companies' mushrooming needs reflect just how hard it is to stanch the flow of losses as the economy deteriorates. Even though the government's finances are being stretched -- and still more aid might be needed in the future -- it is being forced to fill the growing holes in the finances of these companies out of fear that the demise of an important company could set off a chain reaction.
The deepening global downturn is dragging down all kinds of businesses, and, with no bottom to the recession in sight, investors sent the the Dow industrials down 250.89 points, or 3.7 percent, to 7,114.78, a 3.7 percent drop for the day and a loss of about 50 percent from their peak in the fall of 2007. Asian markets followed suit on Tuesday by flirting with the lows they hit last October, with stocks in Hong Kong dropping more than 3 percent, and Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropping more than 2 percent before rebounding slightly.
In an unexpectedly assertive joint statement after two weeks of bank stock declines, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and federal bank regulatory agencies announced that the government might demand a direct ownership stake in major banks that do not have enough capital to weather a deeper downturn. The government will begin conducting a test of the banks' financial health this week.
Administration officials emphasized that nationalizing any of the major banks was their least favorite solution to the banking crisis, but they acknowledged that some banks might be both too big to fail and too fragile to endure another round of shocks without substantial help.
Banks that fail the test will have to raise additional capital. If they are unable to raise capital in the private market, they would have to take money from the government in exchange for preferred stock that would be convertible into common shares, thus giving the government a bigger stake.
The administration is debating how big a role to play in the auto businesses, what concessions the companies should make in return for aid and whether bankruptcy should be considered, though it prefers a private sector solution.
On Monday, Steven Rattner, co-founder of a private equity firm, the Quadrangle Group, was named an adviser to the Treasury on the auto industry.
As the administration takes bigger stakes in companies, the value held by existing shareholders is being diluted, which could make it even harder to attract private money in the future.
Timothy F. Geithner, the secretary of the Treasury, recently outlined a bank recovery plan that included a program to attract a combination of public and private money to buy troubled mortgages and other assets.
A.I.G. serves as a cautionary note about the difficulty of luring private investors when the size of the losses is unknown. In the months since the government initially stepped in last fall to take an 80 percent stake in the insurer, the company has suffered deepening losses and has been forced to post more collateral with its trading partners.
The company, according to a person close to the negotiations, is discussing the prospect of converting the government's $40 billion in preferred shares into common equity.
The prototype could turn out to be Citigroup, which is negotiating with regulators to replace the government's nonvoting preferred shares with shares that are convertible into common stock.
''We absolutely believe that our private banking system is best off being in private hands and we are trying our best to keep it that way,'' said one senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But, he continued, the government is already deeply involved in propping up the banking system and may have no choice.
Officials said they were bracing for the possibility of new problems that might indeed require the government to take a more aggressive stance.
''Given our involvement at this particular stage, there is an element, a possibility over time, that we will end up with some ownership of these institutions,'' the official said. ''This is really about aggressive anticipatory action. It is an acceptance that the future is uncertain, but that we can plan on a certain basis for it.''
Acquiring common stock would give the government more control, but expose it to more risk. Armed with voting shares, government officials would have more power to replace management and change company strategy. But the Treasury would lose its claim to dividend payments, which in Citigroup's case amount to more than $2.25 billion a year.
A.I.G. declined to provide details of its new financial problems, citing the ''quiet period'' just before it issues fourth-quarter results. But some people familiar with A.I.G.'s negotiations said it was on the brink of reporting one of the biggest year-end losses in American history.
Such losses lead to a bigger problem. A further credit rating downgrade would force the company to raise more capital, according to a person involved in the negotiations. The losses appeared to be across the board, unlike the insurer's losses of last September, which were confined mostly to derivative contracts called credit-default swaps.
A.I.G. has not been writing new credit-default swap contracts, and had tried to put the swaps disaster behind it. In November the company worked out a relief package with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in which the most toxic of its swap contracts were put into a kind of quarantine, so they could no longer hurt its balance sheet. But A.I.G. had written several other classes of credit-default swaps, which it kept on its books.
If the latest round of losses severely weaken A.I.G.'s capital and its creditworthiness, then its swap counterparties may be entitled to demand that A.I.G. come up with a large amount of cash for collateral -- precisely the problem that brought the company to its knees last September.
''They stand, unfortunately, to bring others down with them if they go down,'' said Donn Vickrey of Gradient Analytics, an independent research firm.
The difficulty of shoring up A.I.G. must weigh on the administration at this moment. The administration's banking statement amounted to a plan of action demonstrating a way to demand a major and possibly a controlling stake in systemically important banks like Citigroup and Bank of America.
''They are desperate to not nationalize the banks,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG. ''They know what happened when they took Iraq and they would just as soon not take over the banks, because if you own it, you gotta fix it.''

GRAPHIC: CHART: MORE BUCKETS NEEDED FOR A BAILOUT: The government's $153 billion bailout of the American International Group has effectively made it a majority owner of the insurance giant. But the staggering infusion has not been able to stem losses at the company, as it is said to be trying to raise as much as $60 billion in fresh capital to stay afloat.

Navy aircraft carriers have returned to the waters of the Arabian Sea, launching combat planes to provide support for ground troops in Afghanistan. Harried and spread thin, American and British troops have come to rely on airstrikes when overwhelmed. But the strikes have led to soaring civilian casualties, forcing greater care and restraint on the part of the military in how they are used, if at all. Page A6

French critics lavished praise on Jonathan Littell's ''The Kindly Ones,'' a violent, sexually graphic novel about an unrepentant Nazi.

Same-sex couples deserve full equality before the law, and that includes the right to marry. For the last decade or so, members of the Rhode Island State Legislature have regularly proposed bills to allow the state's same-sex couples to marry, only to see the issue die in committee without coming to a vote. Proponents should redouble their efforts to propel them to the floor of both houses, where a favorable vote could help raise the issue in the national consciousness. Page A24

HEADLINE: Stimulus Is Early Focus in Upstate House Race

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
HOOSICK FALLS, N.Y. -- The biggest political matchup in the country right now pits a seasoned Republican lawmaker against an unknown Democrat in one of New York's most traditionally conservative Congressional districts. National Republican leaders have vowed to make the contest a turning point for their beleaguered party, while Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have signaled that they will not be doing any heavy lifting to help out.
All the makings of a Republican rout.
Yet now when layoffs, foreclosures and anxiety are freezing the Catskills, Adirondacks and Hudson Valley like an economic ice storm, a single issue -- the $787 billion federal stimulus package -- appears to be providing the Democratic newcomer, Scott Murphy, with some traction in the campaign to succeed Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in the House of Representatives. 
His Republican opponent, James N. Tedisco, the minority leader in the State Assembly, refuses to say how he would have voted on the stimulus bill. To endorse it, Republican operatives acknowledge, would put him at odds with every House Republican and endanger his support from Washington.
But to oppose it openly carries other risks. Democrats say their polling shows lopsided support for the stimulus in a district that President Obama carried and that Ms. Gillibrand, a Democrat, won twice, despite a 75,000-vote Republican registration edge.
And even Republicans who assailed it as wasteful acknowledge that voters are clamoring for some kind of federal action. So, since the special election is set for March 31, Mr. Murphy is happily blasting away.
''I'm really curious what my opponent is going to do, because he can't seem to decide whether he's in favor or opposed,'' Mr. Murphy, 39, said here after touring a small factory that makes energy-efficient window coverings and could see sales jump thanks to the stimulus. ''In times like this, we need leaders. And leaders have to make decisions.''
Mr. Murphy said he was hearing consistently from voters who ''worry about waste and abuse'' in the stimulus package but welcome it anyway. ''I don't believe it's a perfect bill, but I believe it's something we needed to do,'' he said. ''It's providing money for projects that we can get started on right away, to stimulate the economy and put people to work right away.''
Voters across the 20th Congressional District, a sprawling thing of 10 counties, are clearly hurting. At a Chamber of Commerce breakfast in Lake Placid, where the talk over coffee and eggs was of foreclosures and cutbacks, those who came out to size up Mr. Tedisco included John W. Mills, president of nearby Paul Smith's College. He said 20 of his 975 students had just left school for financial reasons. ''Their parents are losing their jobs, or they're afraid of taking on any debt, even student loans,'' he said. ''It's a fear of the unknown.''
Mr. Mills said people in the North Country favored the recovery program but were skeptical that it would reach as far upstate as the Adirondacks.
Republicans say that their polling shows a stark divide, largely along party lines, and that as many voters believe the stimulus is likely to shorten the recession as think it contains too much pork-barrel spending; more committed Republicans called it a bad idea, but Republicans who voted for Mr. Obama overwhelmingly favored it.
Still, Mr. Tedisco's advisers believe the election will come down to which candidate voters like more, pointing to the 2006 election, when voters chose the appealing Ms. Gillibrand over her Republican predecessor, John E. Sweeney.
The oft-quoted Mr. Tedisco, 58, who was on the other end of the phone when former Gov. Eliot Spitzer referred to himself as a ''steamroller,'' starts out with an obvious advantage: he is far more recognizable in the district than Mr. Murphy. ''It's a guy who people know and like versus a guy who they don't,'' said one Republican operative working with the Tedisco campaign.
But on the stimulus package, Mr. Murphy's taunts have turned Mr. Tedisco a little testy.
In an interview after a swing through Lake Placid on Friday, Mr. Tedisco said that he liked the stimulus bill's tax cuts and public works spending but that it was too laden with earmarks. He said he would not answer the ''hypothetical question'' of how he would have voted on the measure, saying such a question was merely a ''diversion'' from what he called a more important issue: Mr. Murphy's spotty record of voting in elections.
Mr. Tedisco said that if he answered the question, he would only encourage Mr. Murphy to pester him about other positions: ''It won't just be this, it'll be, 'How would you vote on the war in Iraq?' Those are hypothetical. Not walking into a voting booth that's in front of you is not hypothetical. He really could have voted, and he didn't.''
A moment later, Mr. Tedisco accused his interviewer of being ''co-opted'' by Mr. Murphy. ''You're carrying the water on this issue,'' he said, repeating a phrase he had used against a radio reporter the day before.
Mr. Tedisco is not ignoring the economic crisis. He bills his itinerary as a ''road to recovery tour,'' and at the breakfast he said he wanted to refocus the nation's priorities on ''health care, education, upstate jobs and small businesses.'' Around the corner at the village's aging sports complex, he vowed to ''be the congressman who brings the Olympics back to Lake Placid.'' But he did not explain how he would accomplish such things, except by working ''every minute of every day'' and getting in people's faces.
A onetime star point guard at Union College, Mr. Tedisco seems happiest on the attack, and helped kill Mr. Spitzer's plan to let illegal immigrants get driver's licenses. By and large, though, Assembly Republicans, outnumbered 109-41, lack influence in Albany. Mr. Tedisco is perhaps best known for Buster's Law, which made aggravated cruelty to animals a felony after a 1997 incident involving a tabby cat, a teenager and kerosene.
Mr. Murphy, a native of Columbia, Mo., is neither a pure outsider nor a political naif. He was the campaign manager for a winning lieutenant governor's race in Missouri the year he graduated from Harvard, and briefly served as deputy chief of staff when his former client, Roger Wilson, succeeded the late Gov. Mel Carnahan in 2000. That same year Mr. Murphy married the daughter of New York dairy farmers, in the process acquiring a large and politically active extended family: his wife's cousin is the Republican district attorney in Lake George.
More important, in the eyes of national Democrats, Mr. Murphy, now a venture capitalist, amassed enough money and friends to lend his campaign $250,000 and raise another $350,000 out of the gate -- and to start introducing himself to voters in TV ads saying his investments have created 1,000 jobs.
For now, Mr. Murphy is taking no chances, campaigning with the discipline of a candidate protecting a lead. Asked about the limits of his opposition to gun control -- a sensitive issue now for Ms. Gillibrand -- he robotically repeated that he was a ''strong supporter of the Second Amendment.''
Whether he gets much help from national Democrats will depend on if he can gain in the polls and raise more money. Mr. Tedisco, in the meantime, is expecting Representative John Boehner of Ohio, the House minority leader, to show up, and hoping for help from Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Neither side is taking anything for granted. The state as a whole is becoming more Democratic, but Ms. Gillibrand's election was a legitimate surprise, and Republicans are counting on their base of voters returning to the fold.
Then again, in a low-turnout special election, there is no accounting for what moves people to vote.
At the Friday noon rush at Poopie's diner, a Glens Falls institution, Pat Whalen, a home remodeling contractor and a registered independent, polished off a slice of pie at the counter. He lamented his vanishing income, bemoaned having to hold off on the flat-screen TV he covets, and pondered his choices for Congress.
He said he doubted how much the stimulus package would really help the region, but he faulted Mr. Tedisco for ''playing it safe.'' After a moment, he added: ''Somebody with that big of a clan is going to be looking out for us and our problems more: If I vote, I vote for Murphy.''

HEADLINE: SURVEY REVEALS BROAD SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Marjorie Connelly and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
President Obama is benefiting from remarkably high levels of optimism and confidence among Americans about his leadership, providing him with substantial political clout as he confronts the nation's economic challenges and opposition from nearly all Republicans in Congress, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
A majority of people surveyed in both parties said Mr. Obama was striving to work in a bipartisan way, but most faulted Republicans for their response to the president, saying the party had objected to the $787 billion economic stimulus plan for political reasons. Most said Mr. Obama should pursue the priorities he campaigned on, the poll found, rather than seek middle ground with Republicans. 
Mr. Obama will deliver his first address to Congress on Tuesday evening against a backdrop of deep economic anxiety among the public, with worries spanning party, class and regional divides. A majority of Americans, 55 percent, say they are just making ends meet, with more than 6 in 10 concerned that someone in their household might lose his job in the next year.
Americans are under no illusions that the country's problems will be resolved quickly, but the poll suggested that they will be patient when it comes to the economy, with most saying it would be years before significant improvement.
A month into Mr. Obama's term, with his first big accomplishments, setbacks and political battles behind him, more than three-quarters of the people polled said they were optimistic about the next four years with him as president. Similar percentages said that they thought he was bringing real change to the way things were done in Washington and that they had confidence in his ability to make the right decisions about the economy.
The aura of good will surrounding Mr. Obama at this stage of his presidency is similar to the one that benefited Ronald Reagan as he led the nation out of economic gloom.
With a job approval rating of 63 percent, Mr. Obama is in a strong position to sell his economic policies. Yet the poll also captured skepticism about how effective his plans will prove to be in addressing the deep recession, as well as a strain of populism that could test his ability to retain public support for efforts to prop up key sectors of the economy.
At a moment when some economists are talking openly about the possibility of nationalizing banks, a majority of poll respondents said that so far, the administration's bailout plans for financial institutions would benefit bankers, not all Americans. An even wider majority said the struggling automotive companies, which are seeking billions of dollars in additional loans from the government and which are shedding tens of thousands of workers, should not receive any more taxpayer money to help them survive. And while there is a strong belief that government should help homeowners avoid foreclosure, people are evenly divided over whether the plan announced last week is fair.
''The government doesn't step up and help other industries, so why should they help the banks and the auto companies?'' Margie Rowe, 62, a Democrat from Ahoskie, N.C., said in an interview after participating in the poll. ''It's not fair. Our taxpayer money is going to bail out all these corrupt people who are making millions.''
The national telephone poll was conducted Wednesday through Sunday with 1,112 adults, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The poll suggests that for now, Mr. Obama has been successful in explaining to Americans that the country is in for a long road to economic recovery. Over all, 53 percent of the public expect that the economic stimulus plan he signed into law last week will improve things, but half of those surveyed say it is not likely to shorten the recession and just over two-thirds expect that more money will be needed to right the economy.
Nearly all Americans are concerned that the cost of the economic programs will have significant long-term effects on future generations, with 65 percent saying they are very concerned about increasing the national debt and 26 percent suggesting they are somewhat concerned. Yet about three-quarters say they are more concerned about the current economic crisis.
''The one-time help was O.K., but I think the amount they are asking for is unreasonable,'' Priscilla Felknor, 67, a Republican from Dandridge, Tenn., said in an interview after participating in the poll.
Most Americans said the president was trying to make good on his promise to bridge the partisan divide. About three-quarters, including 6 in 10 Republicans, said Mr. Obama had been trying to work with Republicans. But only 3 in 10 Americans said Republicans were doing the same.
On the economic stimulus plan, 63 percent of poll respondents said Republicans opposed the legislation for political reasons, not policy ones. Seventy-nine percent said Republicans should now be working in a bipartisan manner rather than holding fast with their policies.
But 56 percent of those surveyed said Mr. Obama's priority should be following the policies he proposed during the campaign last year, rather than working with Republicans.
Rosemary Wedel, a 65-year-old Republican from Richmond, Tex., who participated in the poll, said in a follow-up interview that she had not voted for Mr. Obama last fall, but that she approved of how he had performed in his first month in office.
''I think it's going to cost us more,'' Mrs. Wedel said, ''but I trust his political savvy.''
The poll found that the public's widespread concern about the economy remained high, though now it is focused considerably more on jobs than on other dimensions of the economy, like the home mortgage crisis. Forty percent of those polled cited jobs and unemployment as the most important economic problem facing the country, up substantially from 11 percent last March, when fuel costs were the greatest concern.
Mr. Obama's approval rating is about 10 percentage points higher than either George W. Bush or Bill Clinton were at this early stage of their presidencies. His job approval rating of 63 percent includes 88 percent of Democrats and 44 percent of Republicans.
The White House is reviewing many practices of the Bush administration, including the barring of photographs of the coffins carrying soldiers killed in Iraq. Mr. Obama has yet to offer an opinion on the matter, but the poll found that 69 percent of Americans would like to see the policy reversed.

HEADLINE: Many Plans to Curtail Use of Plastic Bags, but Not Much Action

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
Last summer, city officials here became the first in the nation to approve a fee on paper and plastic shopping bags in many retail stores. The 20-cent charge was intended to reduce pollution by encouraging reusable bags.
 But a petition drive financed by the plastic-bag industry delayed the plan. Now a far broader segment of Seattle's bag carriers -- its voters -- will decide the matter in an election in August.
 Even in a city that likes to be environmentally conscious, the outcome is uncertain. 
 ''You have to be really tone-deaf to what's going on to think that the economic climate is not going to affect people,'' said Rob Gala, a legislative aide to the city councilman who first sponsored the bill for the 20-cent fee. 
 Regarded by some as a symbol of consumer culture wastefulness, plastic bags have been blamed for street litter, ocean pollution and carbon emissions produced by manufacturing and shipping them. 
 Momentum for imposing fees or bans has expanded from a few, often affluent, liberal cities on the West Coast -- San Francisco was the first big city to ban plastic bags, in 2007 -- to dozens of legislative proposals in states like Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Texas and Virginia. 
 Yet as support increased in places, the national economy began to decline. No state has imposed a fee or a ban. 
 Some officials say they fear a public backlash if they were to raise fees in an economic downturn; others say governments need the revenue now more than ever. Still others say a cleaner environment, not revenue, is their only goal.
 In New York City, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is proposing a 5-cent fee on plastic bags. The measure would require approval by the State Legislature.
 In Connecticut, a bill that would put a 5-cent fee on most paper and plastic bags is being promoted as potentially raising as much as $10 million a year for the depleted budget of the Environmental Protection Department.
 ''We're not just exploring how can we get more money out of this,'' said State Representative Kim Fawcett, a Fairfield Democrat who is sponsoring the bill. ''We're asking, 'How can we help people change their behavior?' ''
 In Maryland, Delegate Alfred C. Carr Jr., a Montgomery County Democrat, said the 5-cent fee he was pushing for plastic and paper bags would pay to help clean up Chesapeake Bay. A parallel proposal in the Washington City Council would finance cleanup efforts on the Anacostia River. 
 Mr. Carr said he had not heard residents complain about the proposed cost.
 But in Portland, Ore., Mayor Sam Adams said this month that he would not pursue a fee, ranging from 5 cents to 20 cents, that he had proposed last fall. Mr. Adams cited the economic strain being faced by people.
 ''Now is not the time,'' the mayor said. 
 In Virginia, several bag bills have stalled amid resistance from retail groups and bag makers that say bans and fees will increase costs and hurt businesses.
 ''Legislators are sensitive to that,'' said Nathan Lott, the executive director of the Virginia Conservation Network. ''They're not demanding a lot of evidence to prove it.''
 As the issue grew across the country and overseas, it became layered with debates on topics like the environmental benefits of bans and fees and to how to win support from retailers for them. 
 Over the last year, bag makers have increased their marketing efforts, saying that their product has been unfairly maligned and that they will do more to reduce waste through recycling. 
 Stephen L. Joseph, a lawyer in the San Francisco Bay Area, is working with several plastic-bag makers and runs the Web site savetheplasticbag.com. Mr. Joseph has filed lawsuits in an effort to stop bans and fees proposed in California by Manhattan Beach and Los Angeles County.
 In the Manhattan Beach case, a Superior Court judge ruled on Friday in favor of bag makers, saying the city should have determined whether a ban on plastic bags would have caused environmental damage by increasing the use of paper bags.
 Plastic-bag makers say they have improved recycling rates through education programs and increased access to receptacles at retail stores; they say those are the kinds of efforts that governments should encourage. 
 ''The important thing to understand from the perspective of this industry is that there's not a single manufactured product on earth that has no environmental profile,'' Mr. Joseph said. 
 ''For some reason,'' he continued, ''the great microscope of the environmental community has decided on the plastic-bag issue and decided, O.K., it's going to be our symbol.''
 Despite its popular appeal, the issue has not been a priority for national environmental groups. They are more likely to focus on broad federal issues like carbon emissions, renewable energy and use of public lands.
 ''This thing,'' Jerry Powell, the editor of the trade magazine Resource Recycling, said of the bag debate, ''is all helter-skelter.''

HEADLINE: In Detroit, 15 Candidates And Probably Few Voters

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
So disillusioned are registered voters here over the scandal that led to Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick's resignation that officials predict only 10 percent to 15 percent will turn out for Tuesday's primary to narrow the field of 15 candidates seeking to become Mr. Kilpatrick's first elected successor.
 The leading candidates are the former City Council president, who under the city charter became interim mayor when Mr. Kilpatrick stepped down in September; a former Detroit Pistons basketball star; the Wayne County sheriff, who runs the jail where Mr. Kilpatrick served his sentence; and a former deputy mayor who lost to Mr. Kilpatrick four years ago. 
 The two candidates with the most votes in Tuesday's nonpartisan primary will face off in May, with the winner serving the final eight months of Mr. Kilpatrick's term. 
 The mayor's political career began unraveling after The Detroit Free Press published text messages showing that he and his top aide, Christine Beatty, had lied when they testified that they had not had an affair. Their testimony came in a trial that led to an $8.4 million settlement with former police officers who claimed they were fired to stop an investigation that could have exposed the affair. Mr. Kilpatrick eventually pleaded guilty to two counts of obstructing justice and no contest to an assault charge.
 City officials made the projection of 10 percent to 15 percent participation among Detroit's 648,400 registered voters, meaning the average polling place will see fewer than 200 voters. Turnout in the last mayoral primary, in 2005, was 21 percent.
 Besides the regularly scheduled mayoral election in November, the mayor chosen in May will have to contend with a budget deficit of as much as $300 million, one of the nation's highest unemployment rates and a failing school system.
 Many of those who are voting see the election as a chance to move past the embarrassment caused by Mr. Kilpatrick. 
 ''We need a fresh start and a fresh perspective,'' said Florida Williams, a retired nurse administrator for the city. Ms. Williams said had she voted by absentee ballot for the former Detroit Pistons star, Dave Bing, who owns a local automotive parts supplier.
 Mr. Kilpatrick ''dragged us into the sewer,'' Ms. Williams said, but Mr. Bing, who has never held elected office, ''didn't have any connection to any of that mess.''
 Recent polls have shown Mr. Bing tied for the lead with Mr. Kilpatrick's immediate successor, the interim mayor, Kenneth V. Cockrel Jr. In third place, but not far behind, was Freman Hendrix, who was deputy mayor under Mr. Kilpatrick's predecessor and who was widely expected to beat Mr. Kilpatrick in 2005.
 On Monday Mr. Hendrix began a 37-hour campaign push in the hope of closing the gap. ''There is a playbook that has been written on how to dig this city out,'' he said on the popular talk radio show ''Inside Detroit.'' ''I was fortunate to be part of the administration that wrote that playbook.'' 
 Mr. Cockrel, whose father was a prominent political activist in the city, said he hoped voters were happy enough with his actions since September to return him to office for another eight months, and then another four years. On his campaign Web site, Mr. Cockrel promotes his cancellation of $2 million in ''questionable city contracts'' and his firing of ''appointees of the last mayor who were not doing their jobs and replacing them with leaders of the highest integrity and experience.''
 For some Detroit residents, the large field of candidates is simply overwhelming.
 ''It's 16 degrees, and people are hunkered down and just trying to keep their jobs,'' said Lyke Thompson, the director of the Center for Urban Studies at Wayne State University here. ''Those factors alone are enough to distract people from getting out to vote.'' 
 And with four mayoral primary and general election days between now and November, Dr. Thompson added, ''I think there's going to be substantial exhaustion by the end of the year.''
 Mike Cooper, a 60-year-old artist, said there were so many candidates, ''I'm just going to wait and see who wins this one, and then I'll definitely vote in May.''
 But Gary Burnett, 53, an unemployed environmental technician, said he would be out Tuesday urging his fellow residents to make a decision and vote. ''Our city is in terrible shape,'' Mr. Burnett said. ''If people sit back and do nothing, that's what they're going to get.''
 Mr. Kilpatrick was released from jail on parole this month and owes $1 million in restitution to Detroit. He has been hired as a salesman, with a six-figure salary, by a subsidiary of Compuware, a software and computer services company based here and run by Peter Karmanos Jr., a longtime Kilpatrick supporter. Days before announcing the hire, Compuware laid off 250 employees. 
 Mr. Karmanos has said the charismatic and persuasive Mr. Kilpatrick can be a valuable asset to the company but would be fired if more legal problems were to arise.

HEADLINE: Campbell Soup Sales Fall as Stores Cut Inventory

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Campbell Soup Company posted a deep drop in quarterly sales on Monday as retailers cut back on inventories of items like condensed soup, usually seen as a consumer favorite in economic hard times. 
 Shares of Campbell fell almost 3 percent as the sales news overshadowed earnings that beat analysts' estimates by a penny.
 Several retailers chose to cut back on inventories at the end of the year. Campbell said sales were hurt by such ''destocking.''
 But soup remained a food of choice for consumers trying to save money. Campbell executives said sales by retailers to consumers outpaced the company's sales to retailers.
 Campbell's profit fell 15 percent, to $233 million, or 64 cents a share, in the second quarter, which ended on Feb. 1. That compared with $274 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Excluding revamping costs and other items, earnings were 65 cents a share. Analysts on average had forecast 64 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Sales fell 4 percent, to $2.12 billion, but analysts had forecast sales of $2.22 billion on average.
 The stronger dollar curbed overseas revenue, the company said. Consumers also bought less expensive products, and the company increased promotional spending. Those factors were partly offset by price increases that Campbell imposed to cope with higher grain and energy costs.
 Campbell's soup sales in the United States rose 8 percent, but Progresso, a brand from General Mills, has gained market share.
 Including the impact of currency fluctuations, the company said its fiscal 2009 forecast would be as high as $2.13 a share, higher than the analysts' forecast of $2.12 a share.
 Campbell shares were down 2.8 percent, at $28.63, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Europe Considers a Tariff on Biofuels

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
The European Union is preparing to impose trade duties on biofuels imported from the United States to prevent American producers from putting European producers of biodiesel out of business, diplomats said Monday. 
 Biofuels are developing into a big business, with sales of about 8 billion euros, or $10 billion a year, in Europe. Imports of biodiesel from the United States total about 1 billion euros. 
 The European Union and the United States subsidize their biodiesel industries. But European producers complain that their counterparts in the United States benefit twice: from subsidies by the federal government to produce the biodiesel and from subsidies granted by individual European governments when the fuel is sold on the Continent.
 Peter Power, the spokesman for the European trade commissioner, Catherine Ashton, said the normal procedure in such trade disputes -- after the European Commission proved that goods had been sold below cost and that European industry had been harmed -- was to impose provisional duties. He said that any definitive measures, lasting five years, would need approval by European governments by summer.
 A formal investigation was started last year after European biofuel producers complained about unfair support for their American counterparts. European officials have said they suspect that the subsidies consist of federal excise and income tax credits along with a program of grants for increases in production, as well as various subsidies from state governments.
 Europe makes large amounts of biodiesel from plant oils like canola and sunflowers. But the Continent, where diesel-powered cars and trucks are widespread, is also a net importer of diesel, including fuel made from crops like soybeans in the United States.
 Trying to keep the dispute from escalating, Pascal Lamy, the director general of the World Trade Organization, called on world leaders to make joint efforts to show that the global trade environment was not deteriorating and that isolationist pressures were contained.
 Mr. Power, the trade commissioner's spokesman, would not comment on whether duties would be imposed on the United States next month.
 Raffaelo Garofalo, the secretary general of the European Biodiesel Board, an industry group, said action was urgent because some European producers had already gone bankrupt. The decision to impose duties ''proves that our complaint was well-grounded,'' he said.
 The European duties would total about 44 euros per 100 kilograms, or 220 pounds, of biodiesel, said diplomats who requested anonymity because governments are still being consulted.
 The dispute shows that despite talk about the need for global cooperation to fight climate change, countries may come into conflict as demand grows for important products and services.
 The move against American producers, which is expected on March 13, comes at a highly sensitive time for global trade. Countries are maneuvering to protect their economies from being undercut by foreign imports to safeguard jobs and industries.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 26, 2009

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about the possibility of the European Union's imposing a tariff on American biofuels referred incorrectly to a statement from Pascal Lamy, director general of the World Trade Organization. Mr. Lamy's comments on the need for world leaders to resist protectionism applied generally to trade pressures during a global financial slowdown; they did not refer specifically to complaints about biofuel exports from the United States.

HEADLINE: Beaker-Ready Projects? Colleges Have Quite a Few

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS and KENNETH CHANG; Gardiner Harris reported from Washington and Kenneth Chang from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The acting director of the National Institutes of Health begged university administrators on Wednesday to avoid even applying for stimulus money unless the universities planned to hire people almost immediately.
 ''It would be the height of embarrassment,'' the official, Dr. Raynard S. Kington, said, ''if we give these grants and find out that institutions are not spending them to hire people and make purchases and advance the science the way they're designed to do.''
 Not a problem, the administrators said, in interviews. After working under flat federal research financing for years, scientists are ecstatic. ''This is a miracle, I think,'' A. J. Stewart Smith, the dean for research at Princeton, said. ''It is redressing this terrible problem where the success rate for excellent proposals was very low.'' 
 From proposed animal research laboratories at the University of Arizona, the University of Nebraska and the University of Pennsylvania to empty floors in laboratory buildings at the University of California, Irvine, Ohio State University and Southern Illinois University, colleges across the country have hundreds of shovel- and beaker-ready projects in the sciences that could collectively cost tens of billions and begin within weeks.
 ''We're grateful for the money, but it's not such a large number that anybody's going to have to look very hard for good projects to fund,'' said Leslie Tolbert, the vice president for research at the University of Arizona. 
 When President Obama signed the $787 billion stimulus measure last Tuesday, one of the law's most surprising provisions was a 36 percent increase in the budget for the National Institutes of Health. The law gives the health institutes $10.4 billion in addition to its annual budget of $29 billion, and the new money must be allocated by September 2010 on grants and other projects that can extend no more than two years. 
 The law gives the National Science Foundation $2 billion in stimulus financing for research grants, and the foundation also has until September 2010 to spend the money. But the foundation will act much faster, pushing nearly all of that money out to scientists within 120 days, said Jeffrey Nesbit, an N.S.F. spokesman. (Last year, the science foundation's $6.1 billion budget included $4.8 billion for research grants; Congress has not finished work on the budget for the current fiscal year.)
 The spending increase comes after six years of nearly flat research budgets at the N.I.H., the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and other agencies, and growing desperation at research universities, which depend on the agencies to underwrite much of their scientific faculty and laboratory infrastructure. 
 To speed the process, the science foundation will not put out any new calls for proposals from researchers, but will instead use the money to finance a higher fraction of proposals already under review and to finance old ones that were judged meritorious last year but were rejected for lack of funds. 
 The one opportunity that will require new applications is for a pool of $200 million for universities to refurbish laboratories. The foundation will provide more details about its spending plans after officials meet this week with the National Science Board, which oversees the N.S.F.
 Dr. Kington of the N.I.H. provided only a broad outline of the agency's new financing priorities. And while he insisted that the health institutes would rely on its traditional method of committee reviews for approving grant proposals, he also said that agency administrators would have unusual discretion in financing proposals.
 Even politics -- long taboo in agency financing decisions -- could play a role.
 ''We will be sensitive to geographic distribution,'' said Dr. Kington, who emphasized that the money was intended to stimulate ''the nation's'' economy.
 Grant proposals that scientific review committees have already deemed worthy will receive top priority for the financing, Dr. Kington said. Nearly all such proposals seek four years of financing, but agency administrators will pick out the grants for projects that they believe could be completed in two years.
 Although Congress has pressed the agency in recent years to increase financing for clinical research, such trials tend to take many years and thus would be unlikely to receive stimulus financing, Dr. Kington said.
 A significant share of the new money will be used to bolster grants that have already received some financing, Dr. Kington said. Some of this supplemental financing will be approved by committees and others by administrators.
 And agency administrators will ''soon'' send out instructions on how universities can apply for grants in special areas that will be given priority by administrators, Dr. Kington said. 
 The agency must spend $1 billion to support construction projects at universities and $300 million to help buy equipment and scientific instruments. An additional $500 million will be spent on federal buildings, mostly at the N.I.H. campus in Bethesda, Md. University administrators said they were eager to get the money and promised that any grants they received would immediately stimulate local economies.
 At the University of Pennsylvania, architectural plans are ready and a site is picked for the Singh Nanotechnology Center, an 80,000-square-foot building for which the university has been able to raise only $60 million of the estimated $95 million cost. The center could be financed by the N.I.H. or the N.S.F., said Steven Fluharty, vice provost for research at the university.
 ''At Singh, a shovel could go into the ground tomorrow if we had the money,'' Dr. Fluharty said.
 In addition to three new science buildings, the University of Pennsylvania has definitive plans for more than a dozen scientific renovation projects that each need $3 million to $15 million to complete, Dr. Fluharty said.
 Susan Bryant, the vice chancellor for research at the University of California, Irvine, said her university could start more than $100 million in construction projects in the next two months if money were available. 
 ''We have several buildings where we didn't have the money to finish part of the building,'' Dr. Bryant said. 
 Although Dr. Kington serves in an acting capacity, he will have more power to distribute more money than any agency director in history. The legislation gives his office about $1 billion to distribute as he sees fit, with few of the agency's usual restrictions.
 But Dr. Kington promised to follow the agency's traditions of rewarding scientific merit, providing opportunity and being transparent.
 ''We're not going to sell our soul for $10 billion,'' he said and then added as a joke, ''It would cost much more.''

HEADLINE: Las Vegas Art Museum Will Close

BYLINE: Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
The Las Vegas Art Museum will close on Saturday, joining the growing roster of cultural institutions that have suspended their operations in the face of a weakening economy, The Las Vegas Sun reported. The museum, which since 1997 has operated from the city's Sahara West Library, lost its executive director, Libby Lumpkin, in December; she resigned when the museum's board said budget cuts would result in reduced salaries and possible layoffs. Under her tenure the museum featured exhibitions on Frank Gehry and the Southern California artists Robert Irwin, John McCracken and James Turrell. But Patrick Duffy, the president of the museum's board, said the museum had seen a substantial decrease in donations amid the financial downturn. ''We've tried everything to keep this afloat,'' Mr. Duffy said, according to The Sun. ''It's just a challenging time.''

HEADLINE: In Sickness and in Health: A 3rd Rescue Would Give U.S. 40% of Citigroup

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Nationalization, at least a partial one, seems inevitable for Citigroup. As Washington prepares to tighten its grip on the struggling company, the implications -- for the troubled financial giant and the rest of the industry -- are starting to sink in.
 Under a plan federal regulators were discussing on Monday, the government may end up owning as much as 40 percent of Citigroup, which has already grabbed two multibillion-dollar lifelines from Washington. 
 The question is, what happens then? Perhaps not all that much, at least for now.
 Even before rescue No. 3 -- which will not involve additional taxpayer money -- federal regulators were clamping down on the company. The government has ordered Citigroup to sell businesses, shake up its board, cut its dividend and reduce risky trading. It has also moved to curb bonuses and perks like corporate jets. 
 Moreover, Citigroup already relies on the government to finance its operations and insure hundreds of billions of risky assets. It has bowed to Democratic lawmakers on bankruptcy legislation that the financial industry had long opposed, and is now required to fill out a public report card on its lending activities monthly. 
 ''What is the big deal?'' said Charles R. Geisst, a financial historian. ''They are wards of the state anyway.'' 
 The Obama administration says it has no plan to nationalize banks outright, and government officials say they want to avoid taking a big stake in Citigroup. The hope is that more equity capital from the government, supplied through the conversion of preferred stock, will help Citigroup pass a new ''stress test'' that federal regulators are preparing to administer to 20 or so large banks. The administration's strategy seems to point in the direction of stopping short of outright nationalization -- where the government takes control -- and stepping up regulatory scrutiny.
 But with greater ownership, there is always the risk that the government might try to exert a lot more influence over Citigroup. The entire banking industry, after all, remains under acute stress. JPMorgan Chase, widely regarded as one of the healthier big banks, announced on Monday that it would sharply reduce its dividend to stockholders to conserve cash in case the economy deteriorates further. 
 Citigroup, with operations in more than 100 countries, encapsulates many of the ills plaguing the global banking industry. In the future, the company will almost certainly be smaller and less profitable than it was in the past, analysts say. 
 ''A year from now, it will be more like a large financial utility,'' said Michael Mayo, a Deutsche Bank analyst. ''Less risk, less leverage, less growth.'' Analysts say the worst-case situation is that the government eventually steps in, breaks up Citigroup and sells off the pieces. Citigroup, they said, could end up half of its current size. 
 A big question is whether the government will press to replace Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's chief executive. Citigroup insiders insist that Mr. Pandit, who inherited many of the problems at the company when he became chief executive in late 2007, has the government's backing. Analysts say it would be hard to find someone willing to take his job. 
 In many ways, Mr. Pandit is already grappling with the same problems that the government would face if it took control. 
 He was forced to split off Citigroup's prized Smith Barney brokerage unit, for instance, to raise capital. He is also scaling back the company's mortgage and proprietary trading operations. He has created a ''bad bank'' structure to hold Citi's money-losing businesses, like private label credit cards and Primerica insurance, and tens of billions of dollars' worth of toxic assets. While the government might demand that Mr. Pandit accelerate plans to sell bad assets, buyers are scarce. The government has also not yet revealed details of its plans for a so-called aggregator bank that might buy some of these assets. 
 Nationalizing Citigroup outright would be a huge challenge, given the company's size and international sweep. In countries like Mexico, for instance, a state-controlled bank might run afoul of local ownership regulations. 
 Analysts also wonder whether a full government takeover of Citigroup would place its rivals at a disadvantage. Customers, for example, might prefer to park their money at a bank backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, rather than a smaller bank that has federal insurance on deposits up to $250,000. Traders might prefer to trade with a bank backed by the federal government. 
 Shares of Citigroup rallied on Monday in the hope that the government's plan would stabilize the company. Shares rose 19 cents, to $2.14. The stock was still down 68 percent for the year.
 Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said it could take years for Citigroup to right itself, even with the government's help. ''I don't think they can do it in a short time,'' he said.

HEADLINE: What Should We Do About the Banks?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Government and the Banks'' (editorial, Feb. 22):
 Our banks are the tires of our economy; with the right pressure and strength they help move it smoothly. 
 With the current situation, these ''tires'' of our economy are more than worn out. Retreading them is not a one-time solution or a fix; a total replacement is the need of the hour, and that can be rightly called the nationalization of banks.
 As a taxpayer ready to dole out my fair share of 2008 taxes and advance tax for 2009, I am appalled to see tax dollars being generously poured into a badly punctured banking system. 
 The present economic meltdown is a global phenomenon because of globalization, and nothing seems to have worked for reviving the downward spiral of the banks. 
 If decades of deregulation could not steer the economy onto the right path, a well-structured banking regulation by nationalization should be considered as a way to check the financial crisis and the overall bankruptcy of business and consumer confidence.
 Atul M. Karnik
 Woodside, Queens, Feb. 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Suggestions to nationalize the banks seem to dismiss the shareholders as collateral damage -- regrettable, perhaps, but not a serious consideration.
 You hold that wiping out shareholders is preferable to burdening taxpayers. But I am a taxpayer and a shareholder, and I can tell you which hurts worse. 
 No one is ringing my doorbell asking me to write a check to cover the stimulus plan; the tax bill will come due some time in the future, and there is every chance that in a recovering economy that bill can be greatly reduced if not eliminated, as President Bill Clinton demonstrated. 
 Nationalizing the banks will erase shareholder value not just for the moment, but permanently, with no way out for retired shareholders.
 Furthermore, the problems the banks face remain the same whether banks are owned by shareholders or by the government. They are no more easily solved simply by transferring ownership. 
 Our economy faces a crisis in fact but also a crisis of confidence. The constant anxiety about nationalization cripples the possibility of share price recovery. Imagine the moment when the markets are persuaded that our leading banks won't be nationalized -- someone, somewhere, is going to start to think they're a good buy. And that really will be the beginning of recovery.

 To the Editor:
 Nationalization of banks would wipe out shareholders. Obviously, investing is a gamble; if your chosen stock tanks, you lose. But when Britain's Socialist government nationalized certain basic industries after World War II, it compensated shareholders, in some cases quite generously, as I know from personal experience. Horace T. Hone

 To the Editor: 
 There are (at least) three problems with your approach.
 First, the testing you encourage will instead lead to a further panic for just about every bank, good and bad, making them susceptible to rumors, which would then become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
 Second, while you suggest firing the current management, who would run these banks? It is not clear if ''learning by doing'' is the best way to run a bank under challenging conditions.
 Third, what would this mean for other industries? If banks are nationalized, why not other industries like autos or insurance? Why not industries that are facing challenges down the road like computers, semiconductors or any other export-driven industries?
 Where and how does it stop?

 There is one sure result of nationalizing banks like Citigroup and Bank of America. Top management executives will blame the government takeover for the failure of their companies and continue in denial that their mismanagement is to blame.

 New Orleans, Feb. 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The revolving door between government and Wall Street, exemplified by the likes of former Treasury Secretaries Robert E. Rubin and Henry M. Paulson Jr., makes me wonder. When and if the government takes over insolvent banks, wouldn't those government people in charge of restructuring the banks more than likely be former Wall Street people, the same people who couldn't keep the banks solvent in the first place?
 Andrew W. Prelusky Jr.
 East Islip, N.Y., Feb. 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman's Feb. 23 column, ''Banking on the Brink,'' is an important correction to the current debate over whether to nationalize the banks. That's not the issue. We have already nationalized much of the risk of banking by recapitalizing banks that squandered their working capital on poor-quality assets.
 The only question now is whether we will nationalize the profits earned on taxpayer funds. This is not Communism any more than the Bush administration's strategy of privatizing profits while socializing risks is capitalism. 
 It's time to abandon dilapidated 20th-century dichotomies and return to the pragmatism that made America an economic powerhouse.
 The Soviet Union fell because it was married to an outdated ideology that blinded it to 20th-century realities. The risk is that the United States will follow in its footsteps. 
 Are we so blinded by a dusty Communist-versus-capitalist dichotomy, long since abandoned in China and elsewhere, that we can't respond effectively to this distinctly 21st-century meltdown? For the sake of my children, please let the answer be no.

 Re ''Disagreements About Stimulus Embroil G.O.P.'' (front page, Feb. 23):
 I cry for my country. Republican governors are sharply divided on the merits of the stimulus package: one group advises moving to the center to attract independent voters; the other advocates a return to the ideology of low taxes and no new government spending ''to regain the trust of conservative voters.''
 Is regaining political power all that matters to these people? At this time of unprecedented national crisis, can they not look beyond the ballot box?

HEADLINE: Ford and Union in Accord on Health Care

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company can substitute its stock for as much as half of its payments into a retiree health care trust under a deal announced Monday by the automaker and the United Automobile Workers union.
 The agreement could form the basis for similar deals with General Motors and Chrysler, which need to cut costs and demonstrate that they can survive under the terms of their loans from the federal government.
 ''The modifications will protect jobs for U.A.W. members by ensuring the long-term viability of the company,'' the union's president, Ron Gettelfinger, said in a statement. 
 Union leaders plan to vote on the proposal early this week, Mr. Gettelfinger said, before presenting the deal to U.A.W. members at Ford for ratification. The changes would also require court approval.
 Ford shares rose 18 percent on the news, to $1.86 in morning trading. Shares of G.M. were up more than 5 percent.
 ''We will consider each payment when it is due and use our discretion in determining whether cash or stock makes sense at the time, balancing our liquidity needs and preserving shareholder value,'' Joseph R. Hinrichs, Ford's group vice president for global manufacturing and labor affairs, said in a statement. ''The agreements, if finalized, will allow Ford to become competitive with foreign automakers' U.S. manufacturing operations, and are critical to our efforts to operate through the current deep economic downturn without accessing government loans and continue to fully invest in our One Ford product plan.''
 The U.A.W., in its 2007 contract with the Detroit automakers, agreed to shift billions of dollars in retiree health care liabilities from the companies to a new independent trust known as a voluntary employee beneficiary association, or VEBA. But as G.M. and Chrysler teeter on the brink of bankruptcy, they are unable to pay as much into the trust as they had agreed to in the contract.
 G.M.'s obligations for retiree health care alone are estimated at $47 billion, and by next year its contract required a contribution of more than $10 billion.
 G.M., which has received $13.4 billion in government loans since December, was pressing the U.A.W. to accept stock for as much as 50 percent of its next contribution to the trust, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.
 Mr. Gettelfinger has been in talks with the companies about ways to make the contributions more palatable while preserving a cornerstone of the U.A.W. contract, which is essentially health care for life for anyone who worked on the assembly line and that worker's surviving spouse. G.M. has already canceled health care for more than 100,000 of its nonunion, salaried retirees.
 Even though Ford is not borrowing money from the government, it had been expected to seek and receive whatever concessions that the U.A.W. granted G.M. and Chrysler, which are now asking to borrow a total of $39 billion. As it has turned out, the union has had better luck negotiating with Ford first and then asking G.M. and Chrysler to accept similar turns.
 Earlier this month, after talks broke down between the union and G.M., Mr. Gettelfinger reached a deal with Ford on issues other than retiree health care and used it to broker terms with G.M. and Chrysler several days later.
 G.M. and Chrysler have until March 31 to show the government that they are making progress in the restructuring plans that they submitted last week. A special task force createdby President Obama will review those plans and next month's filings to determine whether the companies can keep their loans and receive more money.

HEADLINE: Nordstrom Posts Lower Quarterly Profit

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The department store chain Nordstrom posted a lower quarterly profit on Monday, hurt by declining sales and profit margins, but earnings beat Wall Street expectations. 
 Nordstrom's profit fell 68 percent, to $68 million, or 31 cents a share, from $212 million, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Analysts had forecast a profit of 30 cents a share.
 Sales in the period, which ended Jan. 31 and was the fourth quarter of Nordstrom's fiscal year, fell 8.5 percent, to $2.30 billion, from $2.51 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 12.5 percent. 
 Stock in Nordstrom, which is based in Seattle, rose 10.6 percent in after-hours trading, to $12.53 a share, after closing at $11.33, down nearly 5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.
 The company also said it would no longer provide quarterly earnings forecasts because of economic uncertainty but would continue to update its full-year estimates.

HEADLINE: Met Museum To Close Shops, Freeze Hiring

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL; Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Museum of Art will close seven more of its satellite shops around the country, bringing to 15 the number it has closed in the last year, James R. Houghton, the chairman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, wrote in a letter posted on the institution's Web site on Friday. A year ago the museum ran a total of 23 stores, but it has since closed 8, including three in California and one at the South Street Seaport Museum in Lower Manhattan. It now plans to close an additional seven and will instead concentrate on its online shop; it has recently redesigned its mail-order catalog. Citing the global financial crisis, Mr. Houghton said the museum had imposed a hiring freeze and is curtailing staff travel and entertainment as well as the use of temporary employees. He also said the Met was in the process of a museum-wide assessment of expenses to see how it can further reduce costs. Emily Rafferty, the Met's president, said Monday that ''we cannot eliminate the possibility of a head-count reduction.''

HEADLINE: U.A.W. Agrees to Concessions at Ford

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Signaling that it is willing to do whatever it can to save Detroit automakers, the United Automobile Workers union has agreed to concessions with the Ford Motor Company on its retiree health care fund.
 The agreement, announced Monday, would allow Ford to substitute its stock for as much as half of the $13.6 billion it owes the fund. 
 It could also form the basis for similar deals with General Motors and Chrysler, which need to cut costs and demonstrate that they can survive under the terms of their loans from the federal government. 
 ''What they negotiated today at Ford is really something that unions aren't made to talk about,'' said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. ''This is the union trying to hold onto a benefit that few retired workers enjoy and doing it at a cost that may be prohibitively high.''
 But U.A.W. leaders clearly see the alternative to making such concessions as far worse for their membership.
 ''The modifications will protect jobs for U.A.W. members by ensuring the long-term viability of the company,'' the union's president, Ron Gettelfinger, said Monday in a statement.
 Ford, the only Detroit automaker not borrowing billions of dollars from the government, said the deal would let the company be ''competitive with foreign automakers' U.S. manufacturing operations'' and weather the economic recession without federal aid. 
 ''We will consider each payment when it is due and use our discretion in determining whether cash or stock makes sense at the time, balancing our liquidity needs and preserving shareholder value,'' Joseph R. Hinrichs, Ford's group vice president for global manufacturing and labor affairs, said in a statement.
 Union leaders from Ford plants around the country are scheduled to vote on the proposal early this week, Mr. Gettelfinger said, and rank-and-file members will vote subsequently on its ratification. The changes would also require court approval.
 At the same time, G.M. and Chrysler are expected to step up their talks with the U.A.W. Officials from the two companies said on Monday only that discussions were continuing.
 The loans that G.M. and Chrysler have accepted require them to make their labor costs competitive with those of the domestic operations of Toyota, Honda and other foreign automakers.
 The companies have borrowed $17.4 billion since December and last week increased their loan request to a total of $30 billion.
 The U.A.W. agreed in its 2007 contract with the Detroit automakers to shift billions of dollars in retiree health care liabilities from the companies to a new independent trust known as a voluntary employee beneficiary association. But as G.M. and Chrysler teeter on the brink of bankruptcy, they are unable to pay as much into the trust as they had agreed to in the contract.
 The trust is scheduled to pay all health care costs for unionized retirees starting Jan. 1, 2010.
 Last week, G.M.'s president, Frederick A. Henderson, deferred questions about whether benefits for retirees would change, saying the union was responsible for administering those benefits starting next year.
 G.M.'s obligations for retiree health care alone are estimated at $47 billion, and its contract with the U.A.W. required a contribution of more than $10 billion by next year.
 G.M., which has received $13.4 billion in government loans since December, has been pressing the U.A.W. for essentially the same deal that Ford got: accepting stock in place of up to half of its next contribution to the trust. G.M. also is trying to negotiate with its bondholders 
 Mr. Gettelfinger has been in talks with the companies about ways to make the contributions more palatable while preserving a cornerstone of the U.A.W. contract, which is essentially health care for life for anyone who worked on the assembly line and that worker's surviving spouse. G.M. has already canceled health care for more than 100,000 of its nonunion, salaried retirees.
 In recent months, the union agreed to end the jobs bank program, which allows laid-off workers to continue collecting almost full pay, at all three automakers.
 Even though Ford is not borrowing money from the government, it had been expected to seek and receive whatever concessions the U.A.W. granted G.M. and Chrysler. As it has turned out, the union has had better luck negotiating with Ford first and then asking G.M. and Chrysler to accept similar terms.
 Earlier this month, after talks broke down between the union and G.M., Mr. Gettelfinger reached a deal with Ford on issues other than retiree health care and used it to broker terms with G.M. and Chrysler several days later.
 Ford shares rose 9.5 percent, or 15 cents, to $1.73. G.M. shares were unchanged at $1.77.

HEADLINE: Dings at No Extra Charge

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
Rental car companies have been hit from all sides by the weak economy, and road warriors are feeling the impact when they pick up their cars. 
 Instead of getting vehicles with low mileage and that intoxicating new-car smell, even frequent renters are being assigned older, more road-weary cars.
 ''Once a month I'll get a car that has more than 20,000 miles on it,'' said Dan Hemmati, a management consultant from Washington, who rents a car every week. ''Some of these cars are in really poor condition -- stains on the upholstery, or the check engine light is on. Even if you go in and try to switch they'll tell you that's the best car they've got.'' 
 Executives at the car rental companies acknowledge their aging fleets, saying they have been facing an unprecedented set of challenges: declining demand, tight credit markets that make it difficult to buy new cars and a depressed market for used cars.
 ''The used-car market is so weak it would've been cost-prohibitive for us to sell into that market,'' said Richard Broome, a senior vice president at Hertz, which is scheduled to announce earnings on Tuesday.
 Hertz and its competitors have been responding to the downturn by reducing the size of their fleets and laying off employees. They have also been negotiating deals with a greater number of automakers, pursuing new opportunities like the car-sharing business model used by Zipcar, and holding on to vehicles longer. Hertz, for instance, now keeps cars in service for 20 months instead of 16.
 ''You really feel it in the performance of the car,'' said Jeremy Coyle, a payroll consultant from Hoboken, N.J., who recently rented a Chevrolet Impala that shuddered at 60 miles an hour. ''You've heard the expression, 'The fastest car in the world is a rental car'? People trash them.''
 Chris Brown, executive editor of the trade publication Auto Rental News, said companies used to sell vehicles before they'd been driven 20,000 miles but are now keeping them up to 30,000 or even 40,000 miles. 
 ''The industry in general is going through some contraction pains,'' Mr. Brown said, citing staff cuts and stricter enforcement of policies like return times as two other changes that have affected the rental experience.
 A J. D. Power and Associates survey of customer satisfaction with the car rental experience, released in November, found the average score declined for the second year in a row after gradually increasing since 2003.
 That survey was conducted before an industrywide round of layoff announcements in the last few months: 2,200 positions eliminated at the Avis Budget Group, 4,000 at Hertz, 400 at the Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group and 2,000 at Enterprise, a privately held company that also owns National and Alamo.
 ''For Enterprise to lay off people is very, very exceptional, while the other companies have traditionally done it over the years,'' said Neil Abrams, president of the Abrams Consulting Group, which advises car rental companies.
 Mr. Abrams said the industry had been responding to the most difficult downturn he had seen in 33 years. He added, however, that it did have a flexibility that hotels and airlines lacked.
 ''If you look at the two primary assets in this business, you've got cars and you've got people,'' he said. ''The advantage in this industry is that both of those assets are highly scalable and elastic so you can downsize and upsize rather quickly.''
 Mr. Abrams estimated that demand for rental cars was down 10 to 15 percent from a year ago, while the industry had reduced the size of its fleet by more than 15 percent. Yet he said companies still managed to raise rates. In his weekly survey of midsize car rental rates at 10 major airports, the average rate in late January was $78.58 a day, compared with $59.76 a year ago. 
 Companies have also been responding to financial pressures by relying more on technology and by diversifying their business models. Hertz, for example, has installed self-service check-in kiosks at 33 airports and now offers Web check-in. Alamo has made similar changes.
 Dollar Thrifty, which last week announced a net loss of $340 million in 2008, suspended its trial of self-service kiosks in December, citing a disappointing return on its investment.
 Hertz and Enterprise have also entered the car-sharing business, competing with the industry pioneer Zipcar. Hertz's service is similar to Zipcar's model, which allows members to reserve cars and pick them up at neighborhood locations, paying a fee with gas and insurance included.
 While Enterprise hasn't ruled out a direct-to-consumer strategy, its WeCar program is primarily for businesses that want to offer employees a car-sharing option.
 ''People are looking for an alternative to car ownership,'' said Pat Farrell, a vice president with Enterprise, which built its business with neighborhood locations that also offer hourly rentals.
 Industry executives and analysts expect these more customized rental options to be a growth opportunity, especially in light of economic and environmental concerns. Enterprise also recently added 5,000 hybrid vehicles to its fleet to serve a growing demand for smaller, fuel-efficient cars.
 ''There's a different relationship with the automobile in the minds of American consumers than there used to be,'' Mr. Farrell said. ''Now they're looking for us to provide different solutions at different times of their lives.''

HEADLINE: Health Care in the Stimulus

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''U.S. to Study Effectiveness of Treatments'' (front page, Feb. 16): 
 Well-intentioned people differ about the role of the federal government in health care, but who can argue about the need for transparency?
 My article, which you referred to, called the public's attention to numerous health provisions in the stimulus bill that had nothing to do with jump-starting the economy. 
 These changes will affect all of us, at the least by requiring that our treatments be recorded in a federally mandated electronic database and guiding the choices our doctors make. Yet no hearings were held, no expert witnesses called, no opinions gathered from patient advocates, doctors' groups, the elderly or other stakeholders. 
 As a patient advocate, I am worried about that. The public was told that the stimulus bill had to be passed immediately, or in the words of the president, a crisis could become ''a catastrophe.'' 
 The deadline for compliance with electronic data requirements is at least five years off, and the financing for comparative effectiveness research is one-tenth of 1 percent of the total bill. What's the hurry? 
 The health provisions slipped into the stimulus bill, which has now been passed and signed into law, should be repealed and offered as a separate bill. These provisions were too important to have been rushed through without considering consequences for privacy, patient care and medical innovation.

HEADLINE: N.Y.C. Marathon Increases Entry Fees

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
The application process opened Thursday for the 40th running of the New York City Marathon on Nov. 1. The first big road races of the year have had record fields, so the marathon's registration, which closes June 1, could increase for 2009.
 The marathon has already had another significant increase. With the economic outlook uncertain, the organization that directs the race has raised its entry fees. 
 Members of the New York Road Runners will pay $13 more than they did last year, with the fee increasing to $138. Nonmembers will pay $171, an extra $16, and those from other countries entering the international lottery will pay $21 more, $231. The New York City Marathon is the most expensive premium marathon in the country.
 ''As much as we'd like not to raise the prices, it was necessary at this time,'' said Mary Wittenberg, the president and chief executive of the Road Runners.
 Wittenberg estimated that the organization's cost per runner ''is easily more than $250.'' The entry fee was increased even though organizers realized the economy could worsen, Wittenberg said, and the marathon's costs -- like cancellation insurance, liability insurance and special promotions for the race's 40th anniversary -- could rise.
 ''We're sitting in a marketplace where we have to anticipate that costs will be up and revenue will be down,'' Wittenberg said.
 The race's title sponsor, the embattled Dutch financial services company ING, is committed to the marathon through 2010.
 ''We're a not-for-profit, we can't afford to lose money and we're trying to break even,'' Wittenberg said, adding that the Road Runners decided not to raise its $40 membership fee this year.
 Besides the marathon entry fee, the Road Runners charges an application processing fee of $11 (unchanged from last year). That fee is nonrefundable, which has led to frustration in the running world over paying for the right to be rejected.
 Of the approximately 83,000 people (including automatic qualifiers and charity group runners) paying the $11 fee in 2008, 53,146 gained entry to last year's race. After cancellations and deferrals, the 2008 race had 38,832 starters.
 Wittenberg acknowledged the complaints and said the $11 fee went toward technology and other operating costs. ''In an over-subscribed field, it does help ensure that there is a level of commitment of those individuals who sign up,'' she said.
 New York was not the only popular race to raise its entry fees this year. The Walt Disney World Marathon and Half Marathon in Orlando, Fla., raised its fees by $20 to deal with rising costs that included labor, T-shirts, medals and insurance, said the race director, Jon Hughes.
 ''Putting on the race has just become more expensive,'' he said.
 It was the largest jump in fees for the Disney marathon, which was founded in 1994 and was run on Jan. 11. Despite the increase, the races registered record fields. There was no application fee.
 Along with Orlando, marathons and half-marathons in Miami, Houston and Phoenix last month also drew larger fields than ever.
 The Boston Marathon, which will be run April 20, closed its registration on Jan. 26, capping the field at 25,000. Boston did not raise its prices this year -- runners with qualifying times from the United States paid $110 ($116 if they registered online), and $150 for international runners ($6 more online).

HEADLINE: Michigan Is the Latest University to End a Licensing Deal With an Apparel Maker

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The University of Michigan announced on Monday that it was ending its apparel licensing agreement with the Russell Corporation, becoming the 12th university to do so in response to the company's decision to close a unionized factory in Honduras.
 University of Michigan officials said an agreement under which Russell made T-shirts, sweatshirts and fleeces with university logos would end as of March 31 because Russell had violated the university's code of conduct calling on licensees to guarantee the basic rights of workers. 
 Michigan joined Columbia, Cornell, Duke, Georgetown, Purdue, Rutgers and several other universities that curtailed agreements with Russell, a subsidiary of Fruit of the Loom, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway.
 On Jan. 31, Russell closed its Jerzees de Honduras plant, where 750 of the 1,800 employees had joined a union, and the management and the union were in a contract dispute.
 The Worker Rights Consortium, a factory monitoring group sponsored by 185 universities, condemned the closing, saying it had been done partly because of antiunion animus. Another monitoring group, the Fair Labor Association, also found labor violations. 
 In a report issued Feb. 16, Russell said the closing was the result of ''economic considerations and was not caused by the presence of the union at the factory.''
 John Shivel, senior vice president for marketing, advertising and communications at Fruit of the Loom, said the company could not grant an interview about the universities' decisions.
 Kelly Cunningham, a University of Michigan spokeswoman, said the school ended Russell's license on the recommendation of the university president's Advisory Committee on Labor Standards and Human Rights.
 ''The committee found that the company had not respected the employees' right to association and had not adhered to the company's own standards of conduct,'' Ms. Cunningham said. ''We do not feel that continuing the license is appropriate.''
 Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, said, ''Over a period of two years, Russell engaged in the systematic abuse of the associational rights of its workers in Honduras, thereby gravely and repeatedly violating the universities' codes of conduct.'' 
 His consortium, an independent labor rights monitoring group, and the Fair Labor Association had previously found that Russell's Honduras operation improperly fired 145 union supporters in 2007. After numerous universities and student groups protested, the company reinstated the workers, paid back wages and granted union recognition.
 The consortium also found that factory supervisors had harassed and intimidated union supporters and had denied union officials and government inspectors access to the plant.
 ''This is a toxic company,'' said Leigh Wedenoja, a University of Michigan senior who is a member of the president's advisory committee as well as Students Organizing for Labor and Economic Equality. ''We feel that if the university is serious about encouraging human rights, then we could not keep Russell as a licensee.''
 Last Friday, Cornell announced it was ending its agreement with Russell. A University spokesman, Mike Powers, said ''Cornell is committed to respecting the rights of workers around the world, and we expect the companies that are licensed to produce Cornell apparel to share that commitment.''
 In its report last week, Russell wrote, ''We acknowledge that management mistakes were made that led to a failure to adhere'' to ''standards on freedom of association.''
 The company vowed to improve its compliance and enhance what it called its ''overall corporate social responsibility process,'' includes having third-party monitors inspect factories.

HEADLINE: That Can't-Do Spirit

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
In his first Inaugural Address, with the U.S. all but paralyzed by the Depression, Franklin Roosevelt declared that the nation's greatest task was ''to put people to work.''
 Three-quarters of a century later, in the midst of perhaps the worst downturn since the Depression, that remains the biggest challenge. 
 The U.S. economy cannot work if ordinary men and women cannot find work. Let's forget for a moment all the ritualized lingo about tax cuts, all the easy but uninformed talk about entitlement reform and all the empty rhetoric about balancing budgets that will never be truly balanced in our lifetimes. 
 What Americans need is new employment on a massive scale, and one of the most effective ways to get that started is to invest extraordinary amounts in the nation's infrastructure, to rebuild America in a way that creates a world-class platform for a sustainable 21st-century economy. 
 President Obama's stimulus package is just a first step in the government's effort to stabilizing the hemorrhaging economy. It contains infrastructure spending, but nothing comparable to the vast amounts it will take to make the desperately needed improvements.
 Funds spent on those improvements, which will have to be made sooner or later, are also cracker-jack investments in putting people to work. The idea that the government is spending trillions on wars, bank bailouts, tax cuts, and so on, while still neglecting its infrastructure needs -- and at a time when Americans are desperate for jobs -- is mind-boggling. 
 The financier Felix Rohatyn has been carrying the banner for infrastructure spending for the longest time. During an address in Washington over the weekend to a meeting of the National Governors Association, he emphasized the importance and long tradition of investing government revenue, with an eye to returns in the long run.
 ''From the Louisiana Purchase and the Erie Canal, through the creation of the Land Grant colleges, to the interstate highways and the G.I. Bill, government investment was pivotal,'' he said.
 His new book, ''Bold Endeavors: How Our Government Built America, and Why It Must Rebuild Now,'' opens with the stark phrase: ''The nation is falling apart.''
 Mr. Rohatyn goes on to write: ''Three-quarters of the country's public school buildings are outdated and inadequate. More than a quarter of the nation's bridges are obsolete or deficient. It will take $11 billion annually to replace aging drinking water facilities. Half the locks on more than 12,000 miles of inland waterways are functionally obsolete.''
 According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, an investment of $2.2 trillion from all sources over five years would be required to get the nation's infrastructure into decent shape.
 You might ask where that money would come from. Great question. How about an infrastructure bank?
 The current economic crisis is the perfect time to decide that we need to change some of the tired old ways of doing the people's business. Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut has offered a bill that would create an infrastructure bank. It would be a bipartisan entity that would streamline the process of reviewing and authorizing major projects. It would provide federal investment capital for approved projects and use that money to leverage private investment.
 President Obama supports the establishment of such a bank. When I asked him about it in an interview, he said, ''The idea of an infrastructure bank, I think, makes sense.'' But he suggested that there would be stiff resistance from lawmakers in both parties who are reluctant to give up their considerable influence over the selection and financing of lucrative infrastructure projects.
 The president seemed optimistic about the prospects of moving ahead with some additional infrastructure spending, and he said he ''would like to see some long-term reforms'' in the way transportation money is spent. He acknowledged that the nation's infrastructure ''needs are massive, and we can't do everything.''
 But we could do a lot more. There is something weirdly self-defeating about having a need as clear-cut as the need to move beyond a deteriorating 20th-century physical plant, and being unable to do it because of the wasteful, inefficient and outmoded 20th-century way of doing politics and government.
 In his address to the governors, Mr. Rohatyn noted that President Obama had asked Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood to come up with a plan for financing high-speed rail projects. He said he hoped that that would be a step toward the eventual establishment of an infrastructure bank.
 Speaking about America's competitors in the global economy, Mr. Rohatyn noted, among other things, that China was building 100 new airports and that Spanish trains traveling between Madrid and Barcelona can reach speeds of 300 miles per hour.
 ''We are falling behind on too many fronts,'' he said.

HEADLINE: As It Falters, East Europe Raises Risks

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the countries of Eastern Europe have emerged as critical allies of the United States in the region, embracing American-style capitalism and borrowing heavily from Western European banks to finance their rise. 
 Now the bill is coming due. 
 The development boom that turned Poland, Hungary and other former Soviet satellites into some of Europe's hottest markets is on the verge of going bust, raising worrisome new risks for the global financial system that may ricochet back to the United States. 
 Last week, Wall Street plunged after Moody's Investors Service warned that Western banks that had recently beat a path to Eastern Europe's doorstep now faced ''hard landings,'' spooking investors with new fears that the exposure could spread beyond Europe's shores. 
 ''There's a domino effect,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor at Harvard and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. ''International credit markets are linked, and so a snowballing credit crisis in Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries could cause New York municipal bonds to fall.'' 
 The danger is on several fronts. The big European economies, including Britain, France, Germany and Spain, are already in recession, and many of their largest banks have curbed lending at home and abroad. 
 For Central and Eastern Europe, which enjoyed breakneck growth thanks to a wave of credit from these banks, the squeeze could not have come at a worse time. Already bruised by the global downturn, they are on the verge of a downward spiral as the flow of credit dries up. Average growth among countries in the region slid to 3.2 percent last year, from 5.4 percent in 2007. This year, it is forecast to contract by 0.4 percent -- and very likely more.
 ''These numbers will be coming down,'' said Charles Collyns, deputy director of the research department at the International Monetary Fund. 
 Add to that a new worry: International finance officials fret that the worst regional economic crisis since the Berlin Wall came down could set off a contagion among the region's currencies, with echoes of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. Then, emerging markets like Thailand borrowed in foreign currencies to fuel growth, but suddenly owed more than they could afford to pay back once their own currencies lost value. 
 Since peaking last summer, Poland's currency has slumped 48 percent against the euro; Hungary's has fallen 30 percent and the Czech Republic's is off 21 percent. ''Very simply, Eastern Europe has become Europe's version of the subprime market,'' said Robert Brusca of FAO Economics in New York. 
 On Monday, the central banks of Poland, Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic sought to restore calm by issuing statements arguing that the recent sell-off was not justified by economic fundamentals. 
 In addition, Western banks could very likely suffer a further increase in nonperforming loans. ''Most of the banks in this region are from the euro countries and will have to undergo further recapitalization,'' Gillian Edgeworth, an economist with Deutsche Bank in London, said.
 Another problem is that big institutional investors in Western Europe -- banks, pension funds and insurance companies -- have large holdings of East European debt. If the banks need further infusions of capital from Western governments already straining to pay for stimulus packages and to maintain their social safety nets, it could put additional pressure on the euro as well.
 ''The threat to more developed economies goes through the banking channel,'' Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the monetary fund, said in a recent interview.
 As the downturn worsens across the Continent, Mr. Rogoff explained, risk aversion can quickly spread to other parts of the world. Some investors hurt by plunging markets in Europe are having to sell American assets to raise money, adding pressure to a United States stock market already weakened by fears of nationalization.
 ''It's one big trans-Atlantic money market out there, and these banks lend money to each other all the time,'' said Simon Johnson, another veteran of the monetary fund who is a now a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''Deutsche Bank and UBS and Goldman Sachs and Citi are all intertwined.''
 In Eastern Europe itself, the risks for Western companies doing business there have also surged. 
 Until recently, for example, Eastern Europe and Russia were rare bright spots for the beleaguered American automakers Ford Motor and General Motors. In Poland, where G.M. has a major factory, sales rose 10 percent last year to 38,000 cars, while sales in Russia soared 30 percent to 338,000 vehicles.
 Since then, demand has fallen sharply. In the Baltic countries, which were among the first to feel the chill, G.M.'s sales dropped an average of 57 percent in the final months of 2008.
 Among the biggest victims of the crisis are tens of thousands of workers who had clawed their way to more prosperity, only to see their dreams crumble as jobs and the financial system eroded. 
 Because their declining currencies make it more expensive to import goods and to pay off foreign debts, governments have cut spending and reduced public services, leading to a wave of increasingly violent protests across the region that is threatening governments.
 On Friday, the coalition government in Latvia -- where the economy contracted more than 10 percent on an annualized basis last month -- became the second European government, after that of Iceland, to collapse. 
 Meanwhile, in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, demonstrators took to the streets Friday as depositors rushed to pull their money out of local banks.
 The crisis has forced the monetary fund to step into the breach. In recent months, it has extended Ukraine, Iceland, Hungary and Latvia billions in aid. ''I'm expecting a second wave of countries to knock at the door,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn said.
 Two years ago, ''the idea was very, very consistently projected that the I.M.F. would not have to help emerging countries any more,'' and that the ''financial markets would take care of it,'' Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said Friday. Now, he said, this has proved to be ''totally false.''
 For Mr. Johnson and other students of financial history, the latest developments in Europe -- especially in Austria, whose banking industry is heavily exposed to its Eastern neighbors -- raise eerie parallels with the 1930s. Mr. Johnson notes that it was the failure of a Viennese bank, Creditanstalt, in 1931 that was a turning point in what became the Great Depression. 
 Mr. Johnson said he did not expect a repeat of that calamity, but he does foresee a long period of minimal growth, akin to Japan's ''lost decade'' of the 1990s, in both the United States and Europe.
 And while the United States may have been the trigger for this international financial crisis, it is hardly alone in shouldering the blame. ''We set off the sticks of dynamite, but a lot of people had tinderboxes under their houses,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Among Oscars' Reruns, a Few Standout Acts

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
IMAGINE tuning in on Sunday night to watch the Academy Awards and seeing the Oscar for best picture given again to ''No Country for Old Men,'' ''The Departed'' or ''Million Dollar Baby.''
 That was almost what it was like to watch the commercials that appeared during the broadcast on ABC. In another sign of how drastically the recession is forcing Madison Avenue to pinch pennies, many of the spots shown were reruns. 
 For the last several years, marketers have used the Academy Awards as a showcase for new work, much as they do each year with the Super Bowl. But on Sunday, advertiser after advertiser rolled out retreads. Some, like McDonald's, presented no new spots at all.
 And one commercial, from MasterCard, was a re-edited version of a trio of spots the company ran during the 2004 Oscar broadcast. Too bad the Dow Jones industrial average from five years ago cannot be revived as easily.
 As a result, marketers that took the effort -- and spent the money -- to deliver something new stood out. 
 What follows is an assessment of some of the Oscar commercials -- originals or oldies -- broadcast nationally by ABC during the show, out of the total of more than 40.
 BEST ACTORJeff Bridges was never seen on camera during the Oscars. But his voice was heard more often than Hugh Jackman's as he narrated eight commercials for Hyundai Motor America, the No. 1 advertiser in the show.
 The earnest, plain-spoken delivery by Mr. Bridges of lines about the automaker's new incentive plan, called Hyundai Assurance Plus, sounded like a mash-up of Henry Fonda in ''The Grapes of Wrath'' and James Stewart in ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.''
 ''We're all in this together,'' Mr. Bridges intoned. ''It's time to repay your belief in us.'' Is there an opening in the Obama cabinet for a secretary of reassurance?
 Making the pitch from Mr. Bridges even more effective is a credit on his filmography: He portrayed the maverick, populist automaker Preston Tucker in the 1988 movie, ''Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' Agency: Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, part of the Omnicom Group.
 BEST ACTRESS ''I'm a PC,'' says an adorable girl named Kylie Kim in a commercial for the Microsoft Corporation, ''and I'm four and a half.'' But she handles the PC's functions like a pro: ''I click,'' she says as she edits a photo. ''It's better!''
 If a new depression needs a new Shirley Temple, Hollywood ought to consider Ms. Kim: Instead of tap-dancing with Bill Robinson, she could blog with Bill Gates. Agency: Crispin Porter & Bogusky, part of MDC Partners.
 BEST COSTUME DESIGN The presentation of new apparel lines for women by the J. C. Penney Company easily won the competition for outstanding outfits. In a change of pace, most of the commercials showed a young woman dressing up to please herself rather than to impress a date.
 The sole caveat to the kudos for the cavalcade of clothing is that, truth be told, an untrained eye had a tough time distinguishing among the labels on display. Agency: Saatchi & Saatchi, part of the Publicis Groupe.
 BEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT SUBJECT It's a tie! A three-way tie, actually, among the three (blessedly new) commercials for the True North line of nuts sold by the Frito-Lay division of PepsiCo.
 One spot featured the winner of a True North contest to discover people with uplifting personal passions; it was directed by the Oscar-winning actress Helen Hunt. The winner, a former Chicago police officer named Lisa Nigro, founded the Inspiration Cafe, which helps the homeless; the scenes of her and her customers were more moving than any hour of ''Slumdog Millionaire.'' Agency: StrawberryFrog.
 BEST ECO-WARRIOR Who was greener than thou during the Oscars? Not an actor or a filmmaker but Apple, which ran a commercial for the MacBook Pro -- proclaimed ''the world's greenest family of notebooks.'' Agency: TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of Omnicom. 
 BEST FILM EDITING The aforementioned commercial for MasterCard was a deftly compressed version of three spots that were shown originally as a series during the 2004 Oscar broadcast. The story line, about a lost dog that finds its way home, may have benefited from the sped-up presentation because the ending was easy to predict. Agency: McCann Erickson Worldwide, part of the McCann Worldgroup unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
 BEST HOMAGE TO AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT A commercial for Orencia, a drug sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb to treat rheumatoid arthritis, carried the theme ''Oh, yes I can!''
 And in solidarity with the administration's goal of stimulating the economy, the commercial included an offer for the Orencia Promise Program, which can be used to reimburse patients' co-pay payments. Agency: MRM Worldwide, part of the McCann Worldgroup. 
 BEST LIVE ACTION SHORT It's never easy being a neat freak, according to a charming commercial for a new collection of Hoover vacuums called the Hoover Platinum Collection, sold by a unit of Techtronic Industries. The story ends with the soothing promise that ''eventually, your higher standards are rewarded.''
 And in another nod to Barack Obama, the commercial uses the song ''At Last,'' heard during the inaugural balls. Agency: The Martin Agency, part of Interpublic. 
 BEST SOUND EDITING AND MIXING The evocative noises of a Coca-Cola bottle being opened and the soda's effervescent fizz really helped a Coke commercial put across its message of thirst-quenching refreshment. Such aural logos are as valuable to the Coca-Cola Company as its contoured bottle. 
 In a nice touch for a spot shown during the Academy Awards, the commercial was filmed in a fashion reminiscent of an Alfred Hitchcock movie. Agency: Wieden & Kennedy.
 BEST SUPPORTING ACTORTom Cruise's career makeover from serious thespian (''Valkyrie'') to droll comedian (''Tropic Thunder'') received a boost from his performance in a promotional spot for the ABC late-night show ''Jimmy Kimmel Live.'' The punch line may have been predictable, but Mr. Cruise delivered it with panache. The spot was created internally at ABC, part of the Walt Disney Company.

HEADLINE: New York Financier Picked as Top Adviser on Auto Industry Bailout

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J.de la MERCED and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Steven Rattner, a financier known in New York society and a counselor to many corporate chieftains, will join the Treasury Department as a lead adviser on the auto industry bailout.
 Mr. Rattner, 56, will advise Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the National Economic Council, on reorganization efforts by General Motors and Chrysler, two carmakers that are receiving federal bailout money. 
 He was widely considered the front-runner to become the car czar, the Obama administration's point person in mediating negotiations involving G.M. and Chrysler and parts suppliers, bondholders and unions. The car czar would have had a direct oversight role for the industry but the administration did away with that position last week, placing the auto bailout talks under Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers. Mr. Rattner will still play a similar role but in an advisory capacity. 
 The stakes for a bailout of the auto industry have never been higher. As part of the $17.4 billion in federal aid G.M. and Chrysler received in December, they have submitted updates of their reorganization plans, which outlined steep cuts throughout their operations. They have also asked for an additional $14 billion in aid. 
 Many analysts and industry insiders have said, however, that the only solution to the carmakers' problems is some sort of bankruptcy filing. Should that happen, the federal government would almost certainly be responsible for billions of dollars in loans to help keep the factory lights on and the critical vendors like parts suppliers paid. G.M. and Chrysler have estimated that they would need a combined $125 billion in bankruptcy financing, an amount they are unlikely to get from the government.
 With so many parties in the talks -- and with many unwilling to yield much ground to the car companies -- executives and advisers in the negotiations have said that reaching a consensus would be hard without an overseer with the power of a car czar.
 ''We are obviously at a critical moment in our nation's history, particularly with regard to our economy, and I am honored to have this opportunity to serve my country in a meaningful way,'' Mr. Rattner wrote in an e-mail message to friends on Monday.
 For years, Mr. Rattner has cultivated a reputation as a major player in New York's political and charity circles, though he is less known in Washington and Detroit. Mr. Rattner was a financial reporter for The New York Times who later entered investment banking, becoming a deal maker in the media and communications sectors for the likes of Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Lazard.
 In 2000, he was a co-founder of the Quadrangle Group, the media-focused private equity firm that he is now leaving to take the Treasury position. Quadrangle's investments include Metro Goldwyn Mayer, the movie studio, and Maxim magazine. From Quadrangle's offices in the Seagram Building in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Rattner has courted the city's power players, often over lunch at the Four Seasons restaurant downstairs.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, whose blind trust is managed by Quadrangle, said in a statement on Monday: ''Steve has a unique understanding of the incredibly complex relationships between government and markets. I congratulate President Obama for making a great choice.''
 Mr. Rattner has long harbored political ambitions. A longtime Democratic contributor, he backed Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign, and some speculated that he sought the Treasury secretary post in a Clinton administration. His wife, Maureen White, was Mrs. Clinton's finance co-chairwoman.
 For all his success in dealing with media moguls, Mr. Rattner now faces a different test in negotiating with the carmakers and other parties. His close ties to corporate America led some to oppose him as car czar. Ron Gettelfinger, the president of the United Automobile Workers, has suggested that Mr. Rattner was not qualified for the post.
 His experience as a corporate consigliere on the Treasury team will in some ways be counterbalanced by that of Ron Bloom, senior adviser on the auto crisis, a former investment banker who specialized in advising unions in industrial bankruptcy cases. Mr. Bloom was a senior executive at the United Steelworkers union a decade ago. Mr. Rattner and Mr. Bloom briefly worked at Lazard at the same time.
 Quadrangle said on Monday that Mr. Rattner would be succeeded by Michael Huber and Joshua Steiner, who will become co-presidents of the firm, effective immediately.
 ''The Obama administration's selection of Steve represents a distinct honor for him and a rare opportunity for him to help facilitate our country's economic recovery,'' Quadrangle said in a statement. ''While we will clearly miss Steve, we recognize the utmost importance of this appointment.''
 Quadragle is expected to begin raising a new leveraged buyout fund within the next year, without Mr. Rattner's involvement, and its asset management arm will keep one of its highest-profile clients: Mr. Bloomberg.

HEADLINE: 1,000 Points Of Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH M. DUBERSTEIN. 
Kenneth M. Duberstein was the White House chief of staff from 1988 to 1989.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 THE speech that President Obama gives tonight to Congress reminds us of the more formal one he must deliver next January to meet his obligation to, in the words of the Constitution, ''from time to time give to the Congress information on the state of the Union.'' That address, traditionally given each January, is something the founders intended to be a serious tool of real, measurable accountability to Congress and to the American people. 
 The State of the Union address served this purpose for more than 200 years. But given today's challenges and the rapid pace of change, a yearly formal address is no longer sufficient to measure the true state of our Union. To recapture the spirit of the founders -- and to fulfill President Obama's own promise to provide greater accountability in Washington -- another tool is needed, one that enables all Americans to gauge whether we are making progress as a nation. 
 What we need now is a Web-based system for measuring our changing society with key national indicators -- in a free, public, easy-to-use form. Ideally, it would be run by the nonpartisan National Academy of Sciences, which would ensure it has the best quality of information and is kept up to date. The system would enable us to offer in one place statistical information that we spend billions of dollars collecting but that is now underused and undervalued.
 Imagine everyone having at their fingertips answers to questions like: How many quality jobs are we adding to the American economy? How many more students are getting into college? How many more people are gaining access to affordable health insurance? Are we increasing economic growth along with savings and investment? Are we reducing our greenhouse gas emissions?
 Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Michael Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, plan to soon introduce a bill that would allocate about $7.5 million a year for such a comprehensive database of key national indicators, and the idea already has wide bipartisan support. The data, selected by the National Academy of Sciences, would come from public and private sources of information on issues like education, the environment, the economy, energy use, housing, health care and the state of our roads and other public works.
 In the realm of health care, for example, it could include the 20 measures of progress on our health and health-care systems that were recently recommended by the Institute of Medicine -- including self-reported health status, the prevalence of chronic diseases, health-related behaviors like physical activity and nutrition, insurance coverage and health expenditures per capita. 
 Great steps forward in American history occur at moments when our deeply held values are reaffirmed in the face of changing realities. Such a moment is at hand. We need a shared frame of reference that will enable us to practice collective accountability. If Congress acts soon, by the time President Obama delivers his first formal State of the Union address next year, Americans will be able to continually assess the state of the Union for themselves.

HEADLINE: Obama Vows to Slash Federal Deficit

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Despite the huge sums the federal government is spending to aid banks and stimulate the economy, President Obama said on Monday that his administration will slash the federal budget deficit, in part by ending the ''casual dishonesty'' that has accompanied Washington budgets of late. 
 The president said that the bank-rescue plan and the broader economic stimulus program are necessary not merely to jolt the economy but because the country has ''long-term challenges -- health care, energy, education and others -- that we can no longer afford to ignore.''
 ''But I want to be very clear,'' he said at a White House economic conference involving legislators, business and labor leaders and others. ''We cannot and will not sustain deficits like these without end. Contrary to the prevailing wisdom in Washington these past few years, we cannot simply spend as we please and defer the consequences to the next budget, the next administration or the next generation.''
 The president promised, as expected, to halve the deficit that he inherited, estimated at $1.3 trillion or more for 2009, by the end of his first term, partly by having his Cabinet members and other top aides go over the budget ''line by line to root out waste and inefficiency,'' a process he said was already under way.
 More specific clues to the president's thinking may be discernible later this week, when he proposes his first budget, for the federal fiscal year that will begin on Oct. 1. ''We'll start by being honest with ourselves about the magnitude of our deficits,'' he said, chiding former President George W. Bush, unmistakably if not by name, for ''a series of accounting tricks.'' 
 ''We're not going to be able to fall back into the same old habits and make the same inexcusable mistakes,'' he said. One such bad habit has been ''the casual dishonesty of hiding irresponsible spending,'' Mr. Obama said, citing the Bush administration's technique of ''budgeting zero dollars for the Iraq war -- zero -- for future years, even when we knew the war would continue.''
 Sooner or later, the president said, tough choices will have to be faced in dealing with the spiraling cost of health care, ''the single most pressing fiscal challenge we face, by far,'' and to assure the long-term solvency of Social Security. But he also sent a signal that no waste should be considered too small, citing a Department of Agriculture move to put some of its training programs on line to save about $1.3 million a year.
 The deficit is the year-by-year gap between what the federal government spends and the revenue it takes in. So even if the annual deficits are cut, the total national debt will continue to grow. It now stands at just over $10.8 trillion, according to the Department of the Treasury. Of that amount, about $6.5 trillion is owed to individuals, corporations and governments and other lenders both domestic and foreign, while $4.3 trillion is owed for Social Security benefits, military and civil service pensions and other government programs.

HEADLINE: What Part of 'Stimulus' Don't They Get?

 BODY:
Imagine yourself jobless and struggling to feed your family while the governor of your state threatens to reject tens of millions of dollars in federal aid earmarked for the unemployed. That is precisely what is happening in poverty-ridden states like Louisiana and Mississippi where Republican governors are threatening to turn away federal aid rather than expand access to unemployment insurance programs in ways that many other states did a long time ago.
 What makes these bad decisions worse is that they are little more than political posturing by rising Republican stars, like Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina. This behavior reinforces the disturbing conclusion that the Republican Party seems more interested in ideological warfare than in working on policies that get the country back on track. 
 Fortunately, as President Obama prepares for his first address to Congress on Tuesday evening, voters of both parties have noticed. About three-quarters of those polled in a recent New York Times/CBS News survey -- including more than 60 percent of Republicans -- said Mr. Obama has been trying to work with Republicans. And 63 percent said Republicans in Congress opposed the stimulus package primarily for political reasons, not because they thought it would be bad for the economy. It should be sobering news for Republicans that about 8 in 10 said the party should be working in a bipartisan way.
 The Republican Party's attacks on the unemployment insurance portion of the stimulus package are a perfect example. States that accept the stimulus money aimed at the unemployed are required to abide by new federal rules that extend unemployment protections to low-income workers and others who were often shorted or shut out of compensation. This law did not just materialize out of nowhere. It codified positive changes that have already taken place in at least half the states. 
 To qualify for the first one-third of federal aid, the states need to fix arcane eligibility requirements that exclude far too many low-income workers. To qualify for the rest of the aid, states have to choose from a menu of options that include extending benefits to part-time workers or those who leave their jobs for urgent family reasons, like domestic violence or gravely ill children. 
 Data from the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit group, show that 19 states qualify for some of the federal financing and that a dozen others would become eligible by making one or two policy changes. Unemployed workers are worst off in the Deep South, where relatively few people are eligible to receive payments. Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas stand out. 
 The governors are blowing smoke when they suggest that the federal unemployment aid would lead directly to new state taxes. No one knows what the economic climate will be when the federal aid has been used up several years from now. But by dumping billions of dollars into shrinking state unemployment funds, which puts money into the hands of people who spend it immediately on food and shelter, the stimulus could help the states through the recession and into a time when unemployment trust funds can be replenished. In other words, the stimulus could make a tax increase less likely.
 But even if new taxes are required at some point, the new federal standards would protect more unemployed workers than ever before and bring states like Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas into the 21st century. 
 Governors like Mr. Jindal should be worrying about how to end this recession while helping constituents feed and house their families -- not about finding ways to revive tired election-year arguments about big spending versus small government.

HEADLINE: Politics in the Guise of Pure Science

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
Why, since President Obama promised to ''restore science to its rightful place'' in Washington, do some things feel not quite right? 
 First there was Steven Chu, the physicist and new energy secretary, warning The Los Angeles Times that climate change could make water so scarce by century's end that ''there's no more agriculture in California'' and no way to keep the state's cities going, either. 
 Then there was the hearing in the Senate to confirm another physicist, John Holdren, to be the president's science adviser. Dr. Holdren was asked about some of his gloomy neo-Malthusian warnings in the past, like his calculation in the 1980s that famines due to climate change could leave a billion people dead by 2020. Did he still believe that? 
 ''I think it is unlikely to happen,'' Dr. Holdren told the senators, but he insisted that it was still ''a possibility'' that ''we should work energetically to avoid.''
 Well, I suppose it never hurts to go on the record in opposition to a billion imaginary deaths. But I have a more immediate concern: Will Mr. Obama's scientific counselors give him realistic plans for dealing with global warming and other threats? To borrow a term from Roger Pielke Jr.: Can these scientists be honest brokers?
 Dr. Pielke, a professor in the environmental studies program at the University of Colorado, is the author of ''The Honest Broker,'' a book arguing that most scientists are fundamentally mistaken about their role in political debates. As a result, he says, they're jeopardizing their credibility while impeding solutions to problems like global warming. 
 Most researchers, Dr. Pielke writes, like to think of themselves in one of two roles: as a pure researcher who remains aloof from messy politics, or an impartial arbiter offering expert answers to politicians' questions. Either way, they believe their research can point the way to correct public policies, and sometimes it does -- when the science is clear and people's values aren't in conflict.
 But climate change, like most political issues, isn't so simple. While most scientists agree that anthropogenic global warming is a threat, they're not certain about its scale or its timing or its precise consequences (like the condition of California's water supply in 2090). And while most members of the public want to avoid future harm from climate change, they have conflicting values about which sacrifices are worthwhile today.
 A scientist can enter the fray by becoming an advocate for certain policies, like limits on carbon emissions or subsidies for wind power. That's a perfectly legitimate role for scientists, as long as they acknowledge that they're promoting their own agendas. 
 But too often, Dr. Pielke says, they pose as impartial experts pointing politicians to the only option that makes scientific sense. To bolster their case, they're prone to exaggerate their expertise (like enumerating the catastrophes that would occur if their policies aren't adopted), while denigrating their political opponents as ''unqualified'' or ''unscientific.'' 
 ''Some scientists want to influence policy in a certain direction and still be able to claim to be above politics,'' Dr. Pielke says. ''So they engage in what I call 'stealth issue advocacy' by smuggling political arguments into putative scientific ones.''
 In Dr. Pielke's book, one example of this stealthy advocate is the nominee for White House science adviser, Dr. Holdren, a longtime proponent of policies to slow population growth and control energy use. (See TierneyLab, for more on his background.) He appears in a chapter analyzing the reaction of scientists to ''The Skeptical Environmentalist,'' a 2001 book arguing that many ecological dangers had been exaggerated. 
 Dr. Holdren called it his ''scientific duty'' to expose the ''complete incompetence'' of the book's author, Bjorn Lomborg, a Danish political scientist. Dr. Holdren was one of the authors of an extraordinary 11-page attack on the book that ran in Scientific American under the headline, ''Science defends itself against 'The Skeptical Environmentalist' '' -- as if ''science'' spoke with one voice. 
 After reviewing the criticisms, Dr. Pielke concludes that a more accurate headline would have been, ''Our political perspective defends itself against the political agenda of 'The Skeptical Environmentalist.' '' 
 ''Public debates over climate change,'' Dr. Pielke says, ''often are about seemingly technical questions when they are really about who should have authority in the political debate. The debate over the science thus politicizes the science and distracts from policy.'' 
 Dr. Pielke suggests that scientists could do more good if, instead of discrediting rivals' expertise, they acknowledge political differences and don't expect them to be resolved by science. Instead of steering politicians to a preferred policy, these honest brokers would use their expertise to expand the array of technically feasible options. 
 What would honest brokers tell the president about global warming? Dr. Pielke, who calls himself an Obamite, says he's concerned that the presidents' advisers seem uniformly focused on cutting carbon emissions through a domestic cap-and-trade law and a new international treaty. 
 It's fine to try that strategy, he says, but there are too many technological, economic and political uncertainties to count on it making a significant global difference. If people around the world can't be cajoled -- or frightened by apocalyptic scenarios -- into cutting carbon emissions, then politicians need backup strategies.
 One possibility, Dr. Pielke says, would be to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the future. He calculates that it could cost about the same, in the long run, as making drastic cuts in emissions today, and could be cheaper if the technology improves. It could also be a lot easier sell to the public. 
 Yet research into this strategy has received little financing in past budgets or the new stimulus package because it doesn't jibe with the agenda of either side in the global-warming debate. Greens don't want this sort of ''technological fix''; their opponents don't want to admit there's anything to fix. And neither side's advocates will compromise as long as they think that science will prove them right.

HEADLINE: Boosting Global AIDS Funds

 BODY:
The international AIDS community is buzzing with anxiety over unconfirmed reports that the Obama administration may hold down American financing for international AIDS programs that need greatly increased support. We hope that the new budget blueprint to be released this week will leave enough room to grant these and other vital health programs the money they need to care for millions of sick people and to prevent the spread of additional disease around the world. 
 Just last year, we celebrated passage of a bill that authorized spending $48 billion over five years to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria through bilateral agreements with hard-hit countries, a substantial increase over past efforts. To meet that goal, Congress would have to appropriate at least $9 billion a year. It fumbled. The House is poised to approve appropriations of only $4.9 billion for bilateral AIDS programs in fiscal year 2009 plus another $900 million for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. 
 AIDS activists fear that the Obama administration is now planning to ask for only slightly more than that for the fiscal 2010 budget and will also hold American contributions to the global fund well below the levels that program is seeking.
 We recognize that the new administration is searching for ways to stimulate the domestic economy and slow the erosion of jobs. But there are strong arguments -- moral and strategic -- for why the United States should do a lot more to help fight AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis around the world. 
 Left uncontrolled, infectious diseases can destabilize whole regions, especially when hunger is spreading around the globe. Improving the health systems of impoverished countries would help burnish our tarnished image, and it would contribute to our security by lessening the risk of importing infectious diseases.

HEADLINE: More Questions on Merrill Bonuses

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
John A. Thain, the former chief of Merrill Lynch, faced six hours of questioning last week with the attorney general of New York.
 But it was not enough.
 A New York state judge ruled on Monday that Mr. Thain must return to the attorney general's office to provide more details about the bonuses that were given out on the eve of Merrill's merger with Bank of America. The second session with Mr. Thain will take place at 4 p.m. Tuesday, according to the attorney general's office.
 The judge's order followed a motion by the attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, filed in the Supreme Court of New York, earlier in the day. It coincides with the start of a week in which two of Bank of America's top executives will meet with Mr. Cuomo. Later this week, the bank's chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, will answer questions as will the bank's chief administrative officer, J. Steele Alphin. 
 A lawyer for Mr. Thain said he had avoided the questions about bonuses paid to individuals because Bank of America had directed him to do so. Mr. Thain is willing to answer all of the attorney general's questions, the attorney said Monday. ''This is not Mr. Thain's dispute,'' said Andrew J. Levander, who is Mr. Thain's lawyer. ''He has encouraged Bank of America and the attorney general to resolve the confidentiality issue.''
 Mr. Cuomo's office will not be allowed to release information about the pay of individual Merrill employees, but his office may file another motion to change that. 
 Bank of America contends that information is proprietary. A spokesman for Bank of America, Robert L. Stickler, said, ''We are pleased with the ruling which is consistent with the company's position all along -- that the information is private and should remain private to protect the rights of the individuals and the competitive position of the company.''
 The attorney general's investigation has focused on some $3.6 billion in bonuses that Merrill paid at the end of last year. Merrill, struggling to survive, agreed to be acquired by Bank of America in September, but the merger did not close until the end of the year. In the months before the merger closed, Merrill's business deteriorated, resulting in a $15.3 billion post-tax loss in the fourth quarter.
 Neither company disclosed Merrill's problems before the merger closed, and Mr. Cuomo's office is expected to broaden his inquiry beyond Merrill's bonuses into disclosure issues involving the transaction. The loss, which Mr. Lewis called a surprise, prompted Bank of America to seek a second round of taxpayer money. 
 Some details about the loss emerged on Monday. Merrill and Bank of America were $7 billion off in their estimates of Merrill's pretax loss in the fourth quarter, Mr. Thain told the attorney general's office. It was using those incorrect estimates on Dec. 8 when Merrill set its bonus pool, the court filing says. Normally, companies do not make bonus payments until after they close the books for a year -- which Merrill did not do until Dec. 31.
 Mr. Thain, when asked if the worsened results would have lowered bonuses, avoided answering the question last week, according to a partial transcript of his session with Mr. Cuomo's office.
 Mr. Thain said that Merrill as a routine matter did not disclose projections, even as conditions worsen, as they did in December, according to the court filing. 
 ''I don't think it's necessarily the case that we can predict what was going to happen between Dec. 8 and Dec. 31,'' Mr. Thain said at the session. ''Bonuses were determined based upon the performance and the retention of the people, and there is nothing that happened in the world or economy that would make you say that those were not the right thing to do for the retention and the reward of the people who were performing.''
 Mr. Thain also declined to discuss specific bonuses, telling the attorney general's office that Bank of America had asked him not to.
 Mr. Thain told Mr. Cuomo's office that he met with Andrea Smith, a manager in human resources for Bank of America, just after the bonus pool was set on Dec. 8. The two compared bonus awards line by line and Ms. Smith objected to some. In response, Mr. Thain lowered those bonuses, according to the motion. 
 Ms. Smith also detailed what some types of employees were paid at Bank of America, like employees in human resources, risk and public relations, to give Mr. Thain an idea of what to pay Merrill employees in those roles, Mr. Thain said, according to the transcript, which was included with the motion.
 Mr. Thain would not name the people whose bonuses were lowered, and that is why the attorney general is asking him to reappear. 
 The transcript provided a glimpse at the tone of the questioning in Mr. Thain's session last Thursday.
 ''I feel bad for you because you're getting caught in between this,'' said Benjamin M. Lawsky, a special assistant to the attorney general, in the session. ''We're going to end up back here doing this all over again.''
 To which Mr. Thain's lawyer replied: ''Maybe yes, maybe no.''

HEADLINE: News Corp. President Is Leaving

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO; Reporting was contributed by Bill Carter, Michael Cieply and Brian Stelter.

 BODY:
Peter Chernin, Rupert Murdoch's longtime top lieutenant, plans to leave News Corporation when his contract expires in June, a move that renews questions of succession at one of the world's biggest media companies.
 After deciding over the weekend to leave the company after 20 years, Mr. Chernin attended the Academy Awards Sunday night, where ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' a film released by a unit of the News Corporation that he oversees, won best picture. 
 The departure of Mr. Chernin, 57, comes at an inopportune time for the company, which has been hit harder by the economic downturn than some of its competitors because of its exposure to the troubled newspaper industry. 
 Mr. Chernin's exit will mean a degree of instability in the News Corporation's executive ranks at a time when Wall Street has become increasingly frustrated with Mr. Murdoch's devotion to newspapers, a part of the company's stable of businesses that Mr. Chernin is not associated with. 
 Mr. Chernin, who has been the News Corporation's president and chief operating officer since 1996, mainly oversaw the company's Los Angeles-based businesses, like the 20th Century Fox film studio and the Fox broadcast network. Mr. Chernin joined the company in 1989 as president of entertainment at the Fox Broadcasting Company, overseeing the production of shows like ''The Simpsons'' and ''Beverly Hills 90210.'' In 1992, he moved to the film side and became chief executive of Fox Filmed Entertainment; the studio released ''Titanic'' under his watch.
 The company said that when Mr. Chernin leaves upon the expiration of his contract on June 30, those Los Angeles-based units of the company will report to Mr. Murdoch.
 While Mr. Chernin was not seen as a potential successor to Mr. Murdoch -- that spot has always been reserved for one of Mr. Murdoch's offspring -- Mr. Chernin was a highly paid No. 2 whose tenure, in the eyes of Wall Street, represented unemotional leadership in a company controlled by such a large personality as Mr. Murdoch.
 Mr. Chernin has often been lavished with praise by analysts and others in Hollywood, but the dynamic between Mr. Chernin and the Murdoch family was a constant source of speculation within the media industry. Mr. Chernin is also a prominent Democrat in a company whose news outlets, like Fox News and the New York Post, lean rightward, a mix that created an at times awkward situation between Mr. Chernin and Roger Ailes, the head of Fox News who is technically subordinate to Mr. Chernin but in practice answers only to Mr. Murdoch. 
 Mr. Chernin's exit will now cast a brighter spotlight on James Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch's youngest son and the only one of his children with an executive role at the company. In late 2007, James Murdoch was elevated to the newly created post of chairman and chief executive for Europe and Asia.
 In Hollywood, Mr. Chernin has generally been regarded as one of a very small handful of executives -- Robert A. Iger of the Walt Disney Company and Barry Meyer of Warner Brothers are two others -- who excelled at both the internal dynamics and the rapidly changing economic prospects of the entertainment industry.
 During a strike by Hollywood writers in 2007, Mr. Chernin was a crucial figure in enforcing an industry position that resisted opening wider swaths of their company operations to representation by the Hollywood guilds. At the same time, however, he was instrumental in brokering the settlement that finally ended the three-month strike.
 Mr. Chernin also spearheaded many of the News Corporation's digital initiatives, including the 2005 purchase of the social networking site MySpace and the 2007 creation of Hulu, an online video joint venture with NBC Universal.
 Jeff Zucker, chief of NBC Universal, said in an e-mail message, ''Peter is as good a media executive as I have ever seen.'' The two worked together to start Hulu.
 The company made the announcement Monday evening, as Mr. Murdoch was en route to New York from Los Angeles. Both Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Chernin declined to be interviewed. 
 While Mr. Chernin has never been under the illusion that he would eventually take over for Mr. Murdoch, he often clashed with Lachlan Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch's eldest son, who left the company in 2005. And lately, as James Murdoch has steadily gained influence, it has caused tension among top executives. At the same time, Mr. Murdoch was often irritated by the view on Wall Street that Mr. Chernin was indispensable to the company.
 But Mr. Murdoch's $5 billion purchase of Dow Jones in 2007 reminded observers that it is Mr. Murdoch who is in charge. The deal represented a large premium to Dow Jones's value then.
 ''I don't think it's a big deal at this point,'' said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, of Mr. Chernin's departure. ''If the stock was at $18, and this was before Dow Jones, then it would have been a big deal.''
 News Corporation shares closed Monday at $5.78, down 26 cents.
 As part of Mr. Chernin's severance contract, he will receive lucrative television and movie production deals with the company, as well as perks like a car and driver and the use of a private jet. He received a $34 million pay package last year, according to a filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission.
 Mr. Chernin's TV and movie deals will require Fox to purchase two movies a year, for six years. Mr. Chernin would get use of a corporate jet for 50 hours a year, which the company values at $1.65 million over the life of the contract, and a corporate car, which the company values at $210,000. He might also be entitled to secretarial services worth more than $1 million, depending on how the contract is interpreted.

HEADLINE: In Sickness and in Health: Across the Atlantic, Echoes in R.B.S.'s Lifeline

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Is partial nationalization the cure for America's ailing banks?
 The Obama administration's plan to take an increased stake in Citigroup echoes the British government's experience with one of its biggest banks, the Royal Bank of Scotland, a once highflying universal bank that is now nationalized in all but name only.
 As with Citi, Britain's involvement with R.B.S. grew in fits and starts. The government started with a minority holding last fall, when it pulled the bank from the brink of collapse, but continued to tighten its grip as the share price eroded. 
 Today it owns a 68 percent stake, allowing it to exert de facto control over bank management -- which was replaced in a shake-up -- as well as in lending and strategic decisions.
 But such a policy, while cheered by those who advocate a more direct and forceful route to healing sick banks, is by no means a panacea, as the problems at R.B.S. show. 
 ''The beguiling certainty of nationalization will make everyone feel good for 24 hours,'' said Howard Davies, the director of the London School of Economics. ''But what do you do next? You have to have an exit strategy.''
 This week, the bank will announce a $:28 billion loss, the largest in British corporate history, as well as a plan to split itself into a healthy bank focused on core lending in Britain and a so-called bad bank comprising assets it will seek to sell off within five years. Citigroup is engaged in a similar strategy. R.B.S. is also looking to shed more than $:200 billion worth of toxic assets. 
 The revamping, which amounts to a radical dismembering of the bank's far-flung international operations and a severe retrenchment of its wholesale banking operations, will result in the elimination of about 20,000 jobs, the bank is expected to announce. 
 At R.B.S.'s investment banking hub in Greenwich, Conn., top executives most closely linked to the bank's aggressive expansion into the credit markets are being removed.
 Over the weekend, the bank said in an internal memorandum that Simon Drake Brockman, who oversaw capital markets in the Americas, was resigning.
 While R.B.S.'s problems stem from judgments made by its previous management team, the creeping nationalization practiced by the British government has also sown fears among investors that the government's role will be so pervasive as to dull the bank's commercial spirit. 
 Royal Bank of Scotland's stock price has rebounded lately, but it continues to trade at only about 20 percent of its book value -- below that of Citigroup.
 But for the British economy, whose fortunes have been tied tightly to its once-vast financial services industry, concerns about the appearance of nationalization is less important than preventing a banking collapse. 
 This month, when the finance ministers of the Group of 7 developed economies convened in Rome, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, gathered a small group of reporters and told them in no uncertain terms that the government would exercise the full control that it had over its banks to restore profitability and get credit flowing again.
 ''The government has to play an active role in getting banks to rebuild their balance sheets,'' he said. ''It is an essential precondition to getting out of the crisis.''
 In his comments, Mr. Darling repeated an often-heard mantra: that the government is not in the business of running banks. Yet while that may well be the case in theory, it is not in practice. 
 The numbers tell the story in starker terms.
 By absorbing a total of about $:1.5 trillion in liabilities from R.B.S. and the Lloyds Banking Group -- another troubled bank -- on its own balance sheet, Britain may have prevented a banking failure. 
 At the same time, the government has raised the odds that its own finances may buckle. 
 Last week the office of national statistics said that the ratio of Britain's debt to its gross domestic product could rise to as much as 100 percent of G.D.P., from 48 percent now. Such a shift would put the nation on par with economies like Greece and Italy, whose governments have been sharply criticized for fiscal imprudence.
 ''The U.K. has taken a much harder line with its banks,'' said Christopher Whalen, an independent banking analyst. ''The bureaucrats are in charge.''
 At Northern Rock, the mortgage lender that Britain nationalized in 2007 after runs on the bank, the government-appointed board includes an official from the Treasury. All banks in which the government has stakes also report to a small body of technocrats, overseen by a powerful civil servant named John Kingman who once served as Prime Minister Gordon Brown's press secretary.
 One of the biggest clubs the government has sought to wield is aimed at getting the banks in which it holds stakes to increase their lending. On Monday, Mr. Darling said Northern Rock would distribute $:14 billion in new mortgage loans over the next two years.
 But it remains unclear if lending by diktat will be enough to stem the vicious downturn in house prices, especially if the market is so weak that an increased supply of mortgage loans is not sopped up by adequate demand. 
 In Britain, there were 516,000 house purchase loans last year, the lowest level since 1974, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders -- despite government control of two of the country's largest mortgage lenders.
 ''I am not persuaded that the problem is one of supply,'' Mr. Davies said. ''If the public thinks home prices will continue to fall, there is no need to borrow.''

HEADLINE: With Spending Set, At Least for Now, The Knives Come Out

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The White House echoed on Monday with familiar expressions of determination to make tough decisions, as President Obama used a ''fiscal responsibility summit'' to promise to do his part to move the nation's balance sheet back toward balance. 
 Rising budget deficits, he told the invited group of lawmakers and policy experts, ''will require us to make difficult decisions.'' He will be ''going through our budget line by line to root out waste and inefficiency,'' and ''eliminating programs that don't work.'' And he ''will stop the fraud and abuse'' and ''make more tough choices,'' he said, ''to start living within our means again.'' 
 Most of the invitees had heard it all before, from other presidents. They are likely to hear it again from Mr. Obama on Tuesday night, when he addresses a joint session of Congress and tells the nation of his goal to cut annual deficits in half before his term ends in the 2013 fiscal year.
 But by Thursday, when the president unveils his first budget, projecting spending and revenues for a decade, Mr. Obama will have to begin showing how he plans to do that, and where he is willing to make painful cuts or raise new revenues.
 Mr. Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said he would come through. ''You will see the president making hard choices, the president making specific, some specific cuts,'' he told reporters.
 Yet early indications do not suggest bold action. 
 For one thing, because Mr. Obama only recently took office, his initial budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 will be an outline, with the details not available until April. Also, most of the savings it will forecast through his term will result not from new budget-cutting proposals but from a combination of existing policies and economic assumptions: that the drawdown of troops in Iraq will save money, that the Bush tax cuts for upper-income households will expire after 2010, that there will be no need for more big stimulus packages, and that the economy will gradually recover, allowing tax receipts from businesses and taxpayers to begin returning to normal.
 In advance of the fiscal responsibility meeting, the president last week shelved a plan to appoint a Social Security task force to recommend ways to ensure the program's long-term solvency, after protests from Democratic leaders in Congress, especially the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, and from liberal activists who want to head off any reductions of future retirees' benefits.
 For now, Mr. Obama has good reason not to propose immediate spending cuts or tax increases, since either step could deepen the recession. Instead, with economists of all stripes agreeing that the government must get cash into the economy, Mr. Obama in his first month has won passage of a $787 billion two-year economic recovery plan of new spending and tax cuts. The package is significantly larger than the annual appropriations for all domestic programs other than the three big entitlement programs, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
 But having won that victory, while also presiding over ongoing bailouts of the financial and auto industries, Mr. Obama is trying to reconcile last week's deficit spending with this week's talk of deficit cutting.
 Before Monday's fiscal meeting, the president met with most of the nation's governors, who were in town for a meeting of the National Governors Association. Mindful that several Republicans among them have been sharply criticizing the recovery package as wasteful spending, Mr. Obama pointed out that it would allow the governors ''to keep your police officers on the beat, your firefighters on the job, your teachers in the classroom'' and to pay Medicaid bills.
 Looking toward two of his Republican critics -- Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who will deliver his party's response to Mr. Obama's address on Tuesday night, and Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi -- Mr. Obama expressed irritation that the measure's foes had singled out relatively small provisions to condemn the entire package.
 ''If we agree on 90 percent of this stuff and we're spending all of our time on television arguing about one, two, three percent,'' he said, ''that starts to sound a little like politics.''
 Hours later, as he closed the meeting -- after an unusually breezy and even frank give-and-take with the participants, including his rival in the presidential race, Senator John McCain of Arizona -- Mr. Obama said he had ''one last point I want to make.'' He took issue with news reports that the administration was ''doing a pivot,'' as he characterized it, ''because we had just moved forward on the recovery package, now we're talking about fiscal responsibility. How did those two things match up?''
 The stimulus package stemmed from the advice of ''the vast majority of economists,'' he said. ''I have no interest in making government bigger for the sake of it. I've got more than enough on my plate.''

HEADLINE: In Latest Plan for Banks, U.S. Could Demand Voting Stake

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Louise Story and Eric Dash contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration put the nation's biggest banks on notice Monday that the government could become their biggest shareholder if regulators decide they are not strong enough to weather a deeper-than-expected downturn in the economy.
 In an unexpectedly assertive joint statement, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and federal bank regulatory agencies announced that the government might end up demanding a direct ownership stake in major banks after they undergo a tough evaluation of their strength, which is to begin shortly. 
 ''The capital needs of major U.S. banking institutions will be evaluated under a more challenging economic environment,'' the administration said. ''Should that assessment indicate that an additional capital buffer is warranted,'' it continued, the banks could be required to give the government a right to acquire common shares, with voting rights. 
 The statement came as federal regulators confirmed that they were in discussions with Citigroup over precisely that kind of swap. Citigroup, which has received $45 billion in direct assistance and given the Treasury nonvoting preferred shares that pay a guaranteed dividend -- is negotiating to swap the preferred shares for common shares that would give the government a stake as high as 40 percent.
 Administration officials said Citigroup had initiated the talks with federal regulators, and the new statement stopped well short of declaring that regulators were ready to partly or wholly ''nationalize'' any major banks. 
 On Wall Street, most major bank shares were higher in noon trading, while the overall market was down more than 1.5 percent.
 The administration said its ''strong presumption'' was that ''banks should remain in private hands.'' 
 But the statement also officially amounted to a road map under which the federal government could, if it wanted to, demand a major and possibly a controlling stake in systemically important banks like Citigroup and Bank of America. 
 The 20 biggest banks will be required to undergo a new ''stress test,'' starting Wednesday, which is intended to determine whether each bank has enough capital to survive if the economy spirals down even more than most forecasters already expect.
 Treasury officials plan to introduce details of the stress test on Wednesday, and it is expected to take several weeks to complete.
 If a bank comes up short, Treasury officials said on Monday, the government will require it to raise more capital. If the bank cannot get that money from private sources, the government will demand that the bank swap out the government's existing, nonvoting preferred shares -- issued during the first phase of the Treasury's $700 billion financial bailout program last September -- and replace them with new preferred shares that are convertible to common stock with voting rights.
 The requirements will apply both to banks that receive additional money in the months ahead and to banks that have already received money. 
 In the case of Citigroup, the negotiations do not involve any additional infusions of taxpayer money. Rather, the negotiations are aimed at strengthening Citigroup's capital position by replacing preferred shares, which resemble debt more than equity, with common shares.
 Acquiring common stock would give the government more control, but expose it to more risk. Armed with voting shares, government officials would have more power to oust existing management and change the company's strategy. But the Treasury would also lose its claim to dividend payments, which in Citigroup's case amount to more than $2.25 billion a year.

HEADLINE: Negotiator Picked for Post At State Dept.

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday appointed Dennis B. Ross, a seasoned Middle East negotiator under Republican and Democratic presidents, as her special adviser for the gulf and Southwest Asia, a portfolio that will include Iran. 
 Mr. Ross, whose appointment had been rumored for weeks, will provide Mrs. Clinton with ''strategic advice and perspective on the region, offer assessments and also act to ensure effective policy integration throughout the region,'' said the acting State Department spokesman, Robert A. Wood.
 Mr. Ross's appointment adds another prominent name to the ranks of special envoys, emissaries and advisers in the State Department. Former Senator George J. Mitchell, the special envoy for the Middle East, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, have both returned from their first visits to their regions.
 Unlike Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Holbrooke, who are presidential envoys, Mr. Ross will report exclusively to Mrs. Clinton.
 Mr. Ross, who advised President Obama during the campaign, has worked in the State Department and the Pentagon. But he is best known for his lengthy negotiations to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.
 Mr. Ross had advocated a tough approach toward Iran that included persuading Europe to increase economic pressure on the government in Tehran. He is a co-founder of United Against Nuclear Iran, a group dedicated to stopping the country from acquiring nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: Official Says Ex-Governor Is New Commerce Choice

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama has settled on former Gov. Gary Locke of Washington as his latest pick for commerce secretary, a White House official said Monday, as he tries a third time to fill a cabinet position that has bedeviled his administration. 
 The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision had not been formally announced, described Mr. Locke as the ''likely'' nominee, a formulation the Obama team has used in the past for a candidate on the verge of being nominated pending final vetting. The official announcement could come as early as this week.
 Mr. Obama's first choice for the Commerce Department, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, dropped out because of a federal investigation into state contracting. The second choice, Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, withdrew citing philosophical differences with the president.
 Mr. Locke, a two-term governor, former state legislator and onetime county executive, would bring a technocratic, pro-business record to the post. As the first Chinese-American to serve as a governor in the United States, Mr. Locke would also be the third person of Asian descent in Mr. Obama's cabinet, after Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric K. Shinseki.
 Mr. Locke, 59, an immigrants' son raised in public housing who attended Yale University on scholarship, ran Washington from 1997 to 2005. He once termed his legislative agenda ''prudent yet bold,'' a phrase some found fitting for a politician described by The Seattle Times as ''a smart, competent, hard-working policy wonk who was neither flashy nor strongly partisan.'' 
 His most noted action was a multibillion-dollar incentive package to keep Boeing from taking production of its new jetliner to another state, a hugely significant moment for his state's business reputation. But his alliance with Boeing and big business on labor issues earned him the enmity of unions.
 Mr. Locke pushed for improvements in education, but amid a recession-driven budget shortfall he suspended plans to hire more teachers and raise their pay, alienating other supporters. He raised gasoline taxes to improve transportation and led multiple trade missions that increased business with Asia and Mexico.
 Mr. Locke had been mentioned as a possible United States trade representative, but he might have been too pro-trade for the unions. Still, as some in the Obama administration pointed out, the unions should be happier with Mr. Locke at the Commerce Department than they would have been with Mr. Gregg. Moreover, organizations representing minority groups may be happier with him overseeing the Census Bureau, given complaints about undercounting.
 Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, hailed the anticipated nomination of Mr. Locke. 
 ''If Governor Locke is chosen for commerce secretary, I think he would be phenomenal,'' Mr. Rockefeller said. ''Having a governor from a coastal state with a core understanding of what it takes to improve our economy would be most welcome and a tremendous asset.''

HEADLINE: North Korea Statement Raises Worry of a Missile Test

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
North Korea confirmed Tuesday that it was preparing to launch what outside experts believe is a missile theoretically capable of reaching Alaska and Hawaii. But the North insisted that what it planned to launch was a scientific satellite. 
 The North's announcement came only days after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and South Korea's foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, urged it not to carry out a threatened test-launching, calling such a move ''very unhelpful'' and ''provocative.''
 During her trip in Asia last week, Mrs. Clinton called the North Korean government's rule ''tyranny,'' but offered to normalize ties and provide economic help if the isolated nation abandoned its nuclear weapons program. Officials in the region were eagerly awaiting the North Korean response to Mrs. Clinton's overture when the announcement came on Tuesday.
 ''Currently, full-fledged preparation is ongoing to launch a test-purpose communication satellite,'' North Korea's state-run news agency, KCNA, said.
 The statement was the first time North Korea had confirmed its activities at a missile-launching base on its east coast. It did not say when the launching would take place, but the announcement was the clearest sign that it may be imminent.
 In the past few weeks, North Korea has said it has the right to develop a peaceful space program, a term it used when it test-fired its Taepodong-1 ballistic missile in 1998.
 After the 1998 launching, North Korea said it had successfully put its Kwangmyongsong-1, or Lodestar-1, satellite, into orbit. On Tuesday, it said it was preparing to launch its Kwangmyongsong-2 satellite atop its Eunha rocket.
 But officials and experts in the region fear that the rocket is a multistage Taepodong-2. Over the weekend, Jane's Defense Weekly reported that satellite imagery showed North Korea could be ready for the launching of the Taepodong-2 missile or a rocket within a matter of days.
 On Monday South Korea's Defense Ministry issued a report saying that the North had deployed a new intermediate-range ballistic missile that could threaten American military bases in Guam.
 The new missile can travel about 1,800 miles carrying a 1,400-pound warhead, which would reach the American territory of Guam in the south Pacific, according to the Defense Ministry report.
 Although South Korean officials observed the new missile during a military parade in Pyongyang, the North's capital, in 2007, this report was the first time they have publicly confirmed their conclusion that it was ready for use.
