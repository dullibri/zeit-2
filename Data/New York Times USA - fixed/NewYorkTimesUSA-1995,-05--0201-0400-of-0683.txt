Treasury's Long Bond Yield Slides Below 7%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The Treasury's long bond yield slid below 7 percent for the first time in more than a year yesterday, as the market continued to rally on more evidence of an economic slowdown.
Prices, which move in the opposite direction from rates, rose, both for the long bond and at yesterday's three-year note auction. A few analysts said the weak three-year note auction yesterday did not bode well for today's 10-year note auction. 
 The average yield at the three-year auction was 6.16 percent, down from 7.34 percent at the previous auction in February, and the lowest since Feb 1994, when the yield was 4.83 percent.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the 10-year note being auctioned today was offered at a price to yield 6.59 percent.
Traders attributed the rally to a growing consensus that the Federal Reserve's seven interest rate increases since last February are taking effect in the economy. As a result, inflation will be held in check and rates will not rise, eroding the value of fixed-income investments.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, said there were buyers at all maturities, a clue to the market's mind-set. "It may be that the market is reflecting a belief that the Fed is finished raising interest rates," he said.
The session, which extended overnight gains, heated further in early morning trading after Government reports showed that sales at a wholesale level, such as from producers to distributors or other producers, declined for the first time since December.
Wholesale inventories, in the meantime, rose a larger-than-expected 1.2 percent, compared with market expectations for a six-tenths of 1 percent increase. Analysts say a buildup of inventories is considered a signal of declining demand.
Late in the afternoon Johnson Redbook reported seasonally adjusted retail stores sales down 3.9 percent in the first week of May versus April, and that helped support debt futures ahead of the close.
That touched off waves of short- covering by traders, forcing portfolio managers to extend the duration of their portfolios by buying longer maturities, First Albany Corporation's chief investment strategist, Hugh A. Johnson, said.
Another factor in the rally, he said, was the stability of the dollar, which led foreign investors to find their way back into the market.
The 30-year bond rose 16/32 , to a price of 10819/32 for a yield of 6.94 percent, down from 7.03 percent on Monday, and its lowest level since March 23, 1994, when it was 6.89 percent, the day the Fed raised interest rates for the second time in the current cycle.
Chris Moore, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston said, "Open interest on bond futures contracts continues to increase, which suggests that investors are holding onto their contracts and not selling because they see real value in fixed-income assets at these levels."
Traders at the end of the session began looking ahead to April inflation data tomorrow and Friday, which Mr. Moore predicts will meet expectations. "If they come out pretty much plain vanilla then the market will be O.K.," he said, but if the numbers are unexpectedly high, "you'll see people begin to take profits at the first opportunity."
The following are the results of yesteray's Treasury auction of new three-year notes:

HEADLINE: Productivity Has Only Small, 0.7% Gain

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
More signs of a slowdown in the economy emerged today as the Government reported that worker productivity rose just seven-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter and that stocks of unsold goods on wholesalers' shelves grew in March for the ninth consecutive month.
The Labor Department said the rise in nonfarm productivity, or output per hours worked, was the smallest in nine months. 
 The gain followed a revised 4 percent jump in the fourth quarter of 1994 that was previously reported as a gain of 1.7 percent.
The modest rise last quarter reflected a 3.3 percent rise in total output, including farming, down from a 7.7 percent increase in the fourth quarter. It was the smallest gain since the second quarter of 1994.
"That's exactly what you'd expect to see with a slowing in the economy," said Richard Berner, an economist at the Mellon Bank.
Economists said productivity typically slackened as companies reined in output, which in turn pushed up labor costs associated with production.
Indeed, the Labor Department report showed that unit labor costs, which account for about two-thirds of the cost of a typical product, rose 3.4 percent in the first quarter, the largest increase since the first quarter of 1993. Unit labor costs fell six-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter.
Hourly wages, when adjusted for inflation, rose 1 percent, down from 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories in March rose 1.2 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $243.2 billion, after a revised gain of nine-tenths of 1 percent in February. Sales fell for the first time since last fall.
"We're seeing a slowing in demand and a buildup in inventories," Mr. Berner said. "That is consistent with the notion that production will continue to be cut back so inventories can be realigned with sales."
Stocks of both durable goods, which include hardware products and metals, and nondurable goods like chemicals and petroleum, increased in March.
Wholesale sales fell 1 percent in March, to a seasonally adjusted $183.1 billion, following a revised 1.2 percent increase in February. It was the first monthly decline in sales since a drop of six-tenths of 1 percent in September, and it was the biggest decline in any month since June 1993, when sales dropped 1.6 percent.
The department had previously said that inventories had grown 1.2 percent in February and that sales had risen by only 1 percent.
The largest buildup in March inventories was for nondurable goods, which increased 1.8 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $88.6 billion. Unsold stocks of everything from drugs and groceries to chemicals were higher than in February.
Economists said the economy was still fundamentally healthy despite the evidence of a slowdown. "It's not an economy going to pieces," said William Griggs of Griggs & Santow Inc.

HEADLINE: Fulton Crackdown Bill to Cover All Fish Markets

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
A bill before the City Council intended to rid the Fulton Fish Market of corruption has been modified to broaden the city's ability to regulate business owners and workers in other wholesale or retail fish markets in New York City.
The revisions to the bill, which were released yesterday, came after city officials determined that wholesale dealers at the Fulton Fish Market, in lower Manhattan, might move to other sites in the city rather than comply with a plan by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to raise their rents and subject them to tight regulation. 
 If the bill passes the Council, the city's Commissioner of Business Services will be able to require any concentration of fish sellers to register with the city and operate under strict regulation. The bill says the commissioner can call for such oversight if he believes "that an area has the potential for corrupt, dishonest or improper business practices."
Last week, the city reached an agreement with seven wholesale companies to remain at the Fulton Fish Market. In all, there are 40 wholesale dealers at the market, and most are still deciding whether to stay there or move. The new lease includes substantial rent increases.
The Giuliani administration, which contends that the Genovese crime family has been deeply entrenched at the Fulton market, had asked the Council for authority to license and regulate all the market's companies and employees. The Council is expected to approve the proposal later this month.
Jerome X. O'Donovan, the chairman of the Council's Economic Development Committee, said that the revisions made public yesterday had been drafted after meetings between Mr. Giuliani's aides and the Council staff.

2 Retailers' Profits Down In Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 9

 BODY:
Two large clothing store chains, The Limited Inc. and the Ann Taylor Stores Corporation, posted weaker first-quarter profits today, citing the pressure of chilly spring weather and a spending pullback by consumers.
The Limited's earnings fell 17 percent, to $39 million, or 11 cents a share, from $47 million, or 13 cents a share, in the corresponding period last year. Sales rose 7.2 percent, to $1.6 billion. 
 "Our performance in the first quarter was at the lower end of our expectations," said Leslie Wexner. chairman and chief executive of the Limited, which is based in Columbus, Ohio. Analysts, however, had expected an additional penny or two per share. Still, the company's stock closed up 25 cents at $21.25 in New York Stock Exchange trading today.
Ann Taylor, based in New York, said that despite a 16 percent rise in sales, to $168 million, profits fell 56.7 percent, to $3.5 million, or 15 cents a share, from $8.1 million, or 36 cents a share, during the corresponding period last year. Analysts had been predicting 36 cents a share until last week, when the company warned that 15 cents a share was likely, and its stock slid several points. In New York Stock Exchange trading today, its shares closed down 37.5 cents at $20, well below its 52-week high of $44.875 set on Nov. 3.
Both companies were hit by generally sluggish sales of women's apparel, analysts said. In addition to cool spring weather, the analysts cited higher interest rates and stiff price competition among clothing retailers, and they predicted the negative trend would persist into summer.
"There's just continued poor retail business in general, across all categories," said Peter Schaeffer of Dillon, Read & Company. "We don't see any sort of a turnaround through this year."
At Limited, sales at the company's core women's apparel businesses overshadowed gains at its Victoria's Secret lingerie business and Bath and Body Works toiletries stores.
Same-store sales among Victoria's Secret stores open at least a year rose 2 percent in the quarter, Mr. Schaeffer said. But same-store sales at the women's apparel businesses, including the company's flagship Limited stores, fell about 3 percent.
"I was particularly pleased with the results of our intimate apparel and personal product businesses: Victoria's Secret Stores, Victoria's Secret Catalogue, and Bath and Body Works," Mr. Wexner of Limited said.
While Limited's results were disappointing, analysts said, investors remained upbeat about the company's plans to split the women's apparel divisions from the lingerie and personal care store chains. The company, which announced the plans in March, is set to sell 10 percent to 15 percent of each business to the public and retain the rest.
By breaking up the businesses, Limited hopes to heighten focus on some of its rapidly growing chains like Bath and Body Works and bolster the stock's value. The strengths in these newer chains have been hidden by Limited's larger and more visible women's clothing stores, such as Express.
"I think people will have to start to focus on the spinoffs" in coming weeks as opposed to near-term results of the women's businesses, said John Connolly, partner with Miller, Anderson & Sherrerd.

HEADLINE: Steelworkers Know About Job Retraining

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your May 3 news article describing the plight of displaced aerospace workers in California has a familiar ring to displaced steelworkers in Pennsylvania's Monongahela Valley. Steelworkers here experienced the very same problems after the steel mills shut down in the early 1980's, victims of the deindustrialization of America. 
 I am a former steelworker. I worked at the U.S. Steel Homestead Works for 21 years, until it closed in 1986. The mill shutdown left the Homestead steelworkers in the same situation as the California aerospace workers: how to find a decent new job? Many of us made a mistake. We chose job retraining. Job retraining, at that time, and to this day, is a joke. After job training, there were no jobs to fit the training.
The displaced steelworkers, who were looking for a full-time job to provide money, pride and self-esteem, found only bitter disappointment. Few workers have found jobs in their field of training. The majority are underemployed as part-time school bus drivers, security guards, bartenders, house painters or whatever menial jobs they can find. Their wages are far below what they earned in the mills.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and other proponents of job retraining miss an important point: Job retraining doesn't work!
What good is job training if there are no decent jobs available when the training is completed? The long-term solution is the creation of well-paying jobs.

How Experts Cut the Costs But Keep The Magic

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER 

 BODY:
IN the next few months, guests at wedding receptions across the country will devour enough shrimp cocktail, veal loin, turned carrots and frilly layer cake to keep a moderate-size nation bunny-hopping till dawn.
The traditional wedding feast embraces both food and fantasy in equal parts, both of which can be frighteningly expensive. But wedding planners, caterers and banquet managers say that a wedding feast does not have to cost as much as a Ford Explorer to be memorable and that it is possible to curtail expenses by 20 percent or more without sacrificing quality or effect. 
 In New York, a top-of-the-line wedding can easily cost $400 a person -- or $60,000 for 150 people. The food alone, including gratuities, can count for about 80 percent of the total.
With more couples paying for part or all of their own weddings these days (especially in second weddings), cost control is on people's minds more than ever, party planners say. "Watching costs doesn't mean your dinner will be skimpy," said Ellen Eskenazi, a partner in Event of the Year Inc., wedding planners in Manhattan.
An economical but elegant wedding dinner is sort of like a good haircut: the trims should be so discreet that no one notices.
The first consideration for most couples is deciding when and where to hold the wedding reception.
No matter where it is held, wedding planners have uniform advice: if possible, avoid June, when space and labor are at a premium.
"The best time of year to get married if you are watching your money is from the end of July through August, or January and February," said Gail Perl of Perl & Berliner Inc., wedding planners in Fort Lee, N.J. In an off month, especially in winter, costs of the room and the food can be negotiated, whether one chooses a hotel or a party space.
"The discounts you can get vary greatly from hotel to hotel," said Nicholas Type, the director of catering at the Four Seasons Hotel on East 57th Street. "In July and August you can find some very good discounts, up to 25 percent."
The time of day also makes a difference. An afternoon function is generally less expensive than an evening one. "This is especially true if you have a hotel that is booked at night but has the room free during the day," Ms. Perl added. "You can negotiate a good price." Private party spaces, which in Manhattan rent for $1,000 to $3,000 and up for an event, are generally not as flexible.
But a Sunday brunch affair is still far less expensive than a Saturday night dinner. "It's very hard to book weddings at lunchtime, so if you can do that, most hotels are willing to offer substantial reductions," Mr. Type said..
Hotels are not necessarily more expensive than other sites. "If you go to an off-premise site, like a museum, and have a caterer, the food cost could be lower, about 40 percent," said Mary Dearborn, the vice president for catering at Restaurant Associates in New York. "But then the other items could be more expensive and in the end you wind up with a similar price."
When it comes to planning the menu, the smaller items, like reception hors d'oeuvres, count for a lot.
"We tell clients that if they have to put limited money somewhere, they should put it where guests are going to see it and remember it -- and that means the reception," Mrs. Eskenazi said. It seems to be a twist on the old axiom that hot dogs taste better at the ballpark: wedding guests are at their most ravenous -- and impressionable -- at the cocktail reception that precedes the dinner.
"We might advise clients to put money into the reception as opposed to the dinner by maybe adding an attractive pasta station or a carving board to the buffets," said Jackie Zirkman, Mrs. Eskenazi's partner at Event of the Year.
THAT is precisely what Tami Peskin and her fiance, David Nusim, plan to do at their Oct. 21 wedding at Bridgewaters, a party space at the South Street Seaport in Manhattan. The reason was not only financial, although they will save a little.
"We decided to do away with a first course at dinner and go right to the salad and entree," Miss Peskin said. "The reception will have three different stations -- cheeses, carving and pasta. I think guests will be impressed by the setup as soon as they get there."
Waiters will pass the hors d'oeuvres, a trend that wedding planners have seen in recent years.
"It is a fallacy to think that you need less help a for a buffet than passed hors d'oeuvres," said Ms. Perl in Fort Lee. "You still have to man the buffet and have backup help." Wedding planners say not only that it is more elegant to have appetizers passed by waiters, but also that people tend to consume less.
A relatively lavish cocktail reception takes some of the pressure off having a showpiece dinner, which is where the dollars add up. The cost of a formal wedding dinner alone, not including the cocktail reception, ranges from about $90 to $300 or more per person in the New York area. To that are added tax (8.25 percent in New York City) and gratuities of 18 to 20 percent.
There are several ways to trim the dinner. The most common is to eliminate the appetizer and serving a salad, main course and dessert. "The food price should be less," Miss Dearborn said, "and there will be one less setting of china."
If you do have an appetizer, the standard (and expensive) ones like smoked salmon, shrimp and lobster can be supplanted by equally compelling dishes that require more handiwork but are less expensive because the ingredients are cheaper.
"Things like California rolls, carved mushroom caps, beautifully presented vegetables -- these can be wonderful," said Diana Beattie, an independent wedding planner in Manhattan.
The dinner's cost can be further reduced by making the wedding cake the dessert, not just something to taste during a toast. But the cake must be large enough to serve every guest and it should be served soon after the main course.
"The wedding cake is considered part of the fantasy that all brides have," Ms. Perl said. "If you have a wonderful cake, people like to have it for dessert." A wedding cake can start at about $3 a person but can climb to $12 a person if it comes from a specialty baker on the outside.
Wedding planners say the main course is not something most people want to compromise on to save money. Traditional main courses -- beef, veal, lamb -- remain best-sellers, although preferences for one or the other go in fashions.
"Today I see a trend back toward beef," Ms. Perl said. "Young couples in particular are shying away from veal." Poultry, she added, which was equated with a low-budget wedding in the 1960's and 70's, had a resurgence in the 80's but has since fallen out of favor.
When it comes to service, most professional party planners insisted that one should not understaff to save money. Guests should not have to wave down waiters or run out of water or bread -- they get enough bad service in the outside world.
At most weddings today, dishes are served already plated, unlike French-style service in which waiters carry platters to the table. Neither system affects cost much.
"You can ask your caterer or hotel to design a menu that doesn't require a great deal of service staff," Miss Dearborn said. "Some dinners require two butlers per table of 10 guests, but you can tell the caterer that you would prefer a menu that requires only one to one and a half butlers per table." For example, a menu that calls for carving and saucing at the table requires more people.
Beverages can be controlled with few people noticing it. At receptions, for instance, champagne is sometimes served. That can be exceedingly expensive. Hotels charge around $7.50 for a glass of moderate-quality champagne. A bar with good-quality wine and standard liquors for mixed drinks is recommended, although more couples are eliminating mixed drinks.
"It's always nice to have a glass of champagne when the cake is cut," Ms. Perl said, "and by that time most guests are not inclined to drink more than one glass of it."
The bottom line in wedding meals, professionals say, is knowing what is essential and then bargaining over the marginal items.
"It's sort of like buying a car," Ms. Perl said. "You want something and the salesman wants something else. You go at it with him until the salesman hits his bottom line and can't budge. Then you have a new car."

The Goal
 To have a top-of-the-line wedding reception adn dinner in Manhattan for 150 quests without paying top dollar. Good strategy can save about $20,000 of the total cost, which can reach about $50,000.
 
The Timing
 About $12,000 can be saved by holding the wedding in late summer or midwinter, rather than in June. Daytime is also cheaper than evening.
 
The Menu
About $3,750 can be saved by serving more food at the reception and shaving a course off the dinner.
 
The Cake
 About $1,875 can be saved by making the wedding cake the dessert course, not an addition to it.
 
The Drinks
 About $1,300, can be saved by serving champagne with the wedding cake only and not at the reception, where costs can quickly escalate (many hotels charge about $7.50 a glass for a moderate-quality champagne).
 
The Staff
 Avoiding dishes that require carving and saucing at the table will limit the number of servers, thereby saving salaries and tips.

Falling Interest Rates Could Lift the Economy
 Interest rates on long-term bonds fell sharply, dropping below 7 percent yesterday for the first time in 14 months, and the decline is starting to show up in lower rates for home mortgages. That may be just the jolt needed to revive the economy. But rates on other loans have not budged. 
 Most people look to the Federal Reserve to push down interest rates. But the Fed is standing pat, so bond traders are "easing rates for the Fed," as one trader put it, and their action might stimulate the economy. A1.
 More evidence of an economic slowdown emerged, as worker productivity rose just seven-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter and wholesale inventories climbed a larger-than-expected 1.2 percent in March. D16.
 Silver prices plunged in reaction to the slower economy and lower interest rates. D6.
 
A Plan to Cut Federal Spending
 Republican Senators proposed cutting projected Government spending by nearly $1 trillion over the next seven years. Money would be saved in virtually every area of Government except Social Security and law enforcement. A1.
 
Senate Settles on Reduced Tort Bill
 The Senate settled on a bill that would limit the number of civil lawsuits, but the relatively narrow measure would limit punitive damages only for faulty products. A1.
 
Repeal of Glass-Steagall Advances
 The House Banking Committee approved a bill that would repeal the law barring mergers of banks and securities firms, but the bill would require holding companies to operate them as separate subsidiaries. Generally, the Fed would have regulatory responsibility. D2.
 
Ford Sees Lower Auto Sales
 Ford expects auto sales this year to fall to 15.1 million from 15.4 million in 1994. It was Ford's second cut in its forecast in a month. It said surprisingly slack results in April were responsible. D2.
 
Swiss-Warburg Deal Near
 Swiss Bank agreed in principle to buy S. G. Warburg, Britain's biggest investment firm, for $1.27 billion in cash, people close to negotiations in Basel said. Details are expected to be announced today. D5.
 
T.W.A. Drops Commission Cap
 Breaking ranks with other airlines, T.W.A. agreed to scrap a limit on travel agent commissions, at least through September. D5.
 
Net Falls at Limited and Ann Taylor
 The Limited and Ann Taylor Stores posted weaker quarterly profits, pressured by chilly spring weather and a spending pullback by consumers. Analysts predicted other retailers would also feel the pressure. D2.
 
Fountain Pens Popular Again
 The makers of fountain pens are reporting a growing boom in the market for premium pens, those costing more than $50. Although the traditional markets are the United States and Western Europe, demand has picked up in Asia, Eastern Europe and Russia. D3.
 
Mexican Crisis Hits Public Works
 Soaring interest rates in Mexico brought on by the economic crisis have made it impossible for states and local communities there to repay billions of dollars in loans used for public works projects. A13.
 
Ships Aim for Business Travelers
 Two new cruise ships, Legend of the Seas and Crystal Symphony, were built primarily for leisure travelers, but were also designed with the business traveler in mind.

HEADLINE: Contractors Put on Show to Save Their Subsidies

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
This is the season of self-preservation, a fearful time when bureaucrats, businessmen and others who depend on Federal largess will do anything they can think of to fend off Congressional budget cutters.
That's why contractors rolled an electric-powered armored personnel carrier onto the Mall just beyond the Capitol today. They brought along an electric Humvee, too, and something that looked like an electric dune buggy to demonstrate to Congress that all their work had not been in vain. 
 But by day's end it was not clear that they had done much more than plow up the grass and possibly annoy the park police.
"Hey, Gordon, don't tear up the lawn," pleaded Michael J. Gage, the president of a California consortium that sponsored the event. But Gordon roared off in his machine, drowning out Mr. Gage's lament that "this will cost me the $2,000 bond."
The contractors, from consortiums around the country, put on the show because they are afraid they will lose $30 million in annual Defense Department subsidies to develop electric vehicles. Over the years, much of the money has been used to develop the vehicles, and now some in Congress are questioning whether the expense should be cut from the military budget.
"The budget gun has everything in its target, not just electric vehicles," said Winston K. Ashizawa, an official of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which is helping to build electric vehicles.
Mr. Ashizawa, who has been lobbying hard in recent weeks, said he had heard criticism that the electric vehicles project was essentially "drawing away defense dollars from their primary function."
With the electric-powered combat vehicles, the contractors hoped to prove otherwise. They peppered Congressional offices with leaflets inviting representatives and their staffs to the presentation, but only a few showed up during this overcast day on a forlorn patch of the Mall.
If they had, they could have chatted with Elliot L. Richardson, the attorney general who resigned over Watergate. Mr. Richardson provided an essential ingredient of any lobbying campaign: A Big Name.
Mr. Richardson, who is on an advisory board of a company that developed a high-speed flywheel, pronounced the invention "the most exciting technological breakthrough since the discovery of DNA."
Pressed for an explanation, he added, "This is the only battery that operates through the storage of kinetic energy."
The programs may be a target in part because they receive half their Government subsidies from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, a unit of the Defense Department that has come under attack by some Republicans in recent years. They have asserted that the agency's doling out of grants for research and development amounts to an industrial policy in which the Government picks winners and losers among companies that should be competing freely.
With Republicans in control of Congress and its budget-cutting committees for the first time in decades, the agency's contractors have found themselves among the newly vulnerable groups.
"When they hear 'electric vehicles,' they think that's not something the Department of Defense should be doing," said John H. Gully, a program manager for the agency. "These people staged this event to educate Congress."
The vehicles displayed today were prototypes and most are several years from completion, he said. All are hybrids that operate with both conventional gasoline-powered engines and electric power sources and provide three times the fuel economy of internal combustion engines operating alone.
For the military, Mr. Gully said, the hybrids have advantages over conventional vehicles. For instance, the personnel carriers could switch to electric power when it is important to move quietly. And use of electric power would foil heat-seeking missiles attracted to internal combustion engines, he added.
But without funding of additional years of research, the vehicles will be relatively useless.
It remains unclear how the research projects agency will fare in the weeks of budget slashing ahead. Some lobbyists said today that they have had some success in persuading Congressional opponents to leave the agency's budget intact.

HEADLINE: China's Power Struggle

 BODY:
Chinese leaders have intensified an unpredictable power struggle that will determine not only the successors to Deng Xiaoping, but the pace of political and economic reform and perhaps the future of Communist rule itself.
President Jiang Zemin struck the first major blow with a wholesale purge of potential rivals in the Beijing city party organization. The Times's Patrick Tyler reported that it took a tense showdown, with police placed on alert, to convince the Beijing party boss, Chen Xitong, to step aside. 
 It is unsettling to see the fate of the world's most populous country, a nuclear power, being settled by the modern equivalent of medieval palace intrigue. But that is the price of a closed political system where the actions of a few well-placed party and military leaders count for more than majority opinion or formal institutions.
Jiang Zemin captured the inside track for succession through the personal endorsement several years ago of China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping. Mr. Deng, now ill and enfeebled, appears no longer able to protect his political proteges. That leaves Mr. Jiang exposed to potential challenges. Another senior patron of President Jiang and Prime Minister Li Peng, Chen Yun, died last month.
Mr. Jiang's attack on the Beijing leadership seemed to be a pre-emptive move to demonstrate his own toughness. Mr. Jiang, who was not involved in the Tiananmen massacre, has also distanced himself somewhat from Prime Minister Li, who was. That has benefited the third-ranking member of the hierarchy, Qiao Shi, a former security chief who now heads China's nominal legislature.
Considerations of power, rather than ideology, appear to drive China's succession struggle. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that Qiao Shi, despite his security background, has recently emerged as a strong advocate of more pluralistic politics. If power were to pass to a Jiang-Qiao alliance, there could be an acceleration of political and economic reform.
Washington has only marginal influence over China's succession politics, exercised mainly through the prestige it can confer on contenders by treating them as world leaders. President Clinton made the right call when he decided to avoid meeting privately with Mr. Jiang while both are in Moscow this week. Scrupulous neutrality is the wisest policy for protecting American interests in a highly uncertain Chinese future.

HEADLINE: Time for Hardball With Japan

BYLINE: By Patrick J. Buchanan 

 BODY:
McLEAN, Va.
With the collapse of U.S.-Japan trade talks, the hour of the economic nationalist may be at hand.
Demands that Japan open its market to more American autos and parts have been rudely rebuffed. Japan's top negotiator has virtually dared us to impose sanctions. We will haul you up before the world trade organization, Tokyo warns; there we will have you branded a violator of the free trade principles you so noisily preach -- before an international tribunal you yourselves set up. 
 Angry Clintonites reportedly intend to impose 100 percent tariffs on $1 billion of Japan's exports. This doesn't even qualify as a spanking. Americans are in a mood for action; and Republicans should demand more serious sanctions. Since 1970, Japan has purchased 400,000 U.S. cars, while selling us 40 million. Where Tokyo runs an annual trade surplus of $150 billion, our merchandise trade deficit has hit $166 billion. As this vast transfer of U.S. wealth was taking place, we were spending 6 percent of G.N.P. on defense, while Tokyo kept defense spending below 1 percent.
But now that Japan has given Mr. Clinton the wet mitten across the face, what is America to do? Free trade ideologues side with the Japanese. To them, trade deficits don't matter; U.S. consumers who swap dollars for quality Japanese goods are the real winners. But it is getting harder to convince the nation. As our share of world G.D.P. has fallen, the real income of Americans who work with their hands, tools and machines has fallen 20 percent in 20 years. Anecdotal evidence of a new two-tier economy is everywhere. College graduates come home to live with parents. Mothers leave children in day care to take jobs to maintain the family's standard of living.
Japan's negotiators hang tough because they're not ideologues; they're economic nationalists looking out for Japan first. And why should they abandon the protectionist policy that has worked splendidly for them to adopt a U.S.-style trade policy that has failed dismally for us? As for those U.S. officials who lecture them on free trade, Japan's envoys must have a special contempt. Many wind up on Tokyo's payroll as Washington lobbyists, parroting the Japanese line. But middle America is losing patience. Even establishment journalists are writing that we are being played for fools.
Congress, for once, should take unilateral action in the national interest. An across-the-board tariff of 10 percent on all Japanese goods entering the U.S. would net $12.5 billion. That shock would awaken Tokyo to the new reality that we Americans have begun looking out for America first. The revenue could be used to cut corporate taxes on small business, thus creating new American jobs, in addition to the new jobs created when Detroit recaptures its old markets.
If Japan retaliates, raise the tariff to 20 percent. Japan cannot win a trade war with America. It would be putting at risk $125 billion in exports to us, while we would risk but $60 billion in exports to Japan.Toward free traders like Canada and Europe, our policy should remain free trade. But toward predators like Japan and China, it is time for hardball.
Let us return to the trade policy created by Washington and Hamilton, pursued by Jefferson and Jackson, perfected by Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. Called the American system, it converted the U.S. from 13 rural colonies into the greatest industrial power the world had ever seen, producing 40 percent of the world's goods by World War II. After all, the powers that have lately embraced this system are today running the world's great trade surpluses.

HEADLINE: Threats by Prosecutor Cited By Counsel on Leasing Deal

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., May 9

 BODY:
The Suffolk County District Attorney may have broken the law by threatening county legislators with grand jury inquiries, a special counsel hired by the Legislature said today.
Several legislators, including Presiding Officer Donald R. Blydenburgh, have said that the District Attorney, James M. Catterson, tried to intimidate them with threats of investigations if they continued to question a county car-leasing deal negotiated by his son, James Catterson Jr., a deputy county attorney. 
 Mr. Catterson appeared to be the primary target of the special counsel, Laura A. Brevetti, a former assistant United States Attorney retained by the County Legislature last December to investigate the lease and the allegations against Mr. Catterson.
Others, including the County Sheriff and the County Health Commissioner, have made similar allegations of intimidation against Mr. Catterson, who is a Republican like most of his accusers.
In a report on the findings of her six-month investigation, Ms. Brevetti said she found evidence of forgery, perjury and gross misuse of taxpayers' money by county officials.
Ms. Brevetti said that although Mr. Catterson had emphatically denied the allegations of intimidation, she recommended a "further investigation by an objective authority" into whether he had violated laws barring obstruction or attempted obstruction of governmental administration.
In fact, a special prosecutor -- Joseph W. Ryan Jr., a former president of the Nassau County Bar Association -- is already looking into Mr. Catterson's actions and is expected to conclude his investigation this summer.
Mr. Catterson today characterized Mrs. Brevetti's investigation as "a colossal witch hunt reminiscent of the McCarthy era."
"She has spent over $400,000 of the taxpayers' money selectively taking testimony without any public hearings, acting like a fact-finder, judge and jury," Mr. Catterson said. "She was hired by Mr. Blydenburgh to do a hatchet job, to smear people and bear no responsibility."
Ms. Brevetti spent more than four hours today making an oral presentation to the Legislature on her findings. She has scheduled two more sessions for Wednesday and Thursday and said a final printed report on her findings would be issued on May 17.
Questions concerning the car-leasing deal were first raised a year ago after the Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, a Republican, entered into a $17 million contract with PHH Vehicle Management Services of Maryland for up to 1,700 vehicles to replace the county's aging fleet. He won approval of the contract after a bitter power struggle with the County Legislature's Republican leadership.
Ms. Brevetti said the political power struggle generated a "lot of rumor and rhetoric and political expediency."
"While one would think the lease was intended to be a prudent and economical use of public money," she said, "it actually increased costs, decreased competition and was an imprudent use of taxpayers' money. In the end, the taxpayers did not get a good deal."
She said estimates indicated that had the car-lease deal not been subsequently revised by the Legislature, the lease would have cost the county $32 million over five years, while an outright purchase of the cars would have cost $23 million, financing included.
"I believe that the County Executive was not fully informed by his staff and others about the car-lease contract," she said, adding that Mr. Gaffney had been "extremely patient and cooperative" when he gave his sworn statements during two separate meetings in his office.
On the other hand, she said Mr. Catterson, while agreeing to be questioned on the matter, declined to give a sworn statement.
Mr. Catterson, in response, insisted that Ms. Brevetti had "no legal right to demand that anyone give a sworn statement."
"She's trying to be a special prosecutor, and she's not," he said.
"I met with her for five hours and I told her the intimidation incident never happened." he said. "I also gave her the names of two witnesses who were present when I met with Blydenburgh, but she has never questioned either of them.
"I told her I would be happy to speak under oath, but only before the full Legislature at a public hearing. I was the first to propose such a hearing a year ago, but they want no such hearings, only full control so they can blacken our names and leave us no recourse. It's an outrageous situation."
Ms. Brevetti told the Legislature's bipartisan ad hoc committee on car-leasing plans that she interviewed more than 60 people and compiled more than 4,500 pages of testimony in dispositions, all of them under oath except Mr. Catterson's.
While questioning the County Executive, Ms. Brevetti said she showed Mr. Gaffney a letter bearing what appeared to be his signature that was sent to Salvatore Alfano, president of the BGS Leasing Group, which was later hired by the county to advise it on the car leasing.
Mr. Gaffney, who is up for re-election this fall, said that the signature was not his and that he could not recall such a letter, which advised Mr. Alfano to discuss the car leasing with James M. Catterson Jr., the deputy county attorney. Mr. Alfano said he found the letter, which he said was a copy, in his files. No original copies of the letter were ever found, Ms. Brevetti said.
While the county's top elected Republican officials continued to squabble, Democrats looked on and smiled. "There was bombshell after bombshell today, and there will be more tomorrow," said one legislator, Steve Levy, a Democrat.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 16, 1995, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about an investigation of a car leasing deal in Suffolk County referred imprecisely to evidence of forgery, perjury and misuse of taxpayers' money. The County Legislature's special counsel did not indicate who might have been involved. The juxtaposition with a paragraph about District Attorney James M. Catterson was inadvertent.

Hotel construction is planned as part of growth at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.

BYLINE: By Harriet King 

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
THE Seattle-Tacoma International Airport has been generating hotel construction and expansion as traffic at the airport grows.
The latest to announce plans is the Westin Hotels and Resorts. The chain, based here, plans to build a 364-room hotel with conference and meeting rooms connected by a skybridge to the terminal of the airport. 
 The Seattle Airport Hilton is also considering tearing down its 175-room hotel and replacing it with a midrise that would contain up to 500 rooms. "It's a matter of timing," said Peter Lynn, the general manager. "Development may be two to three years away."
Nine hotel chains currently have a total of 2,700 rooms close to the airport. In 1994, they had an occupancy rate of 72.8 percent, said Wolfgang Rood, president of the Pacific Hospitality Consulting Company, a concern in Bellvue, Wash.
The Seattle-Tacoma airport, which is 20 miles south of downtown Seattle, is the fifth-fastest-growing airport in the world. The airport handled 21 million passengers last year, and nearly 40 million travelers are expected by 2020.
More airlines will be flying out of the airport as well. The latest is Asiana Airlines, with flights beginning to Seoul, South Korea, on Monday. Chul Sung Kang, Asiana's general manager in Seattle, said demand was increasing for service because South Korea was the second- largest Asian market for Washington State exports, valued at $2.8 billion a year.
Terry Finn, an airport spokesman, said, "Any new international route such as Seoul is a big plum and brings $150 million a year to our local economy."
The activity stands in contrast to the situation in downtown Seattle, where no new hotels have been built in years. But the occupancy rate for existing hotels is strong at 75.4 percent, Mr. Rood said. Rates downtown average $110 a room, compared with $80 a night at the airport.
The Port of Seattle, the authority that operates the airport, had requested proposals from developers for an airport hotel last year. The Westin chain, which is owned by the Aoki Corporation of Japan, won the competition. Negotiations of the final terms of a 75-year ground lease are nearing completion.
The $40 million hotel, with 16 stories, will be the tallest building at the airport, where the tallest are now six stories. Rick Zieve, lead architect for NBBJ of Seattle, which designed the structure, said that a 200-foot sky bridge would take guests from the airport's main ticketing level across to the hotel lobby. The airport will eventually expand its terminal into the space under the sky bridge.
The hotel will have a 5,000-square-foot ballroom and a large meeting room that can be divided, a health club and board room-style meeting spaces at the 16th floor opening onto a terrace on the roof.
This summer a decision is to be made by the port, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Puget Sound Regional Council, a transportation planning board, on whether to build a third runway of up to 8,500 feet at the airport. The planning council a year ago gave up on its search for a new airport site after meeting resistance from residents.
Since 1992, the agency has spent $174 million to prepare for the future. It has upgraded concourses and doubled retail space to add shops.
The Federal Aviation Administration has said that even without a new runway, economic benefits from increasing activity at the airport would create 110,000 new aviation-related jobs, $17 billion in added business revenue each year and an increase of more than $400 million a year in state and local tax revenues over 25 years.
But Sam Uchello, general manager of the Seattle Marriott at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport, said he expected hotel development to move forward cautiously. He said Boeing's new 700,000-square-foot Spare Parts Center in the area was also drawing vendors and airline personnel and was helping hotel occupancies.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Investment Is A $2 Billion Bet on the Net

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
With its $2 billion investment in Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the MCI Communications Corporation is making corporate America's biggest bet yet that the Internet is going to be a thriving business in a few years.
MCI is certainly not alone in the corporate rush onto the global computer network. In the last few years, an estimated 10,000 companies have erected their own electronic billboards on the World Wide Web, the multimedia part of the Internet. 
 Yet these are mostly inexpensive experiments to show that the companies behind the Web sites are in step with the high-tech times, not real money-making businesses.
By linking with Mr. Murdoch's newspapers-to-movies group, MCI hopes to add valuable services -- "content," in industry jargon -- to its telecommunications distribution network. That should result, the theory goes, in a profitable business.
"We just got a big-time content provider," said Tim Price, an executive vice president of MCI.
In Mr. Murdoch's view, the MCI-News Corporation linkup will be able to offer "new media services on a global scale" like no other company. While new media may someday mean interactive television, it now typically means transmitting text, audio or video over computer networks -- and the Internet is the biggest new arena.
"This deal underscores how the Internet is becoming the core of a fast, new world for business and information services," said Tony Rutkowski, executive director of the Internet Society, a nonprofit organization in Reston, Va. "It's amazing how quickly it has happened."
The potential market is enormous. An estimated six million computers are linked directly to the Internet, a threefold rise from a year ago, according to the Internet Society. The total number of people who can tap into the Internet from computer keyboards on any given day is estimated at more than 30 million worldwide.
In North America, roughly 47,000 companies have their own Internet mailboxes, or domain names, from which they can send and receive electronic mail. And more than 700 companies are registering domain names each week.
For all the size of the potential market, the amount of business done over the Internet remains quite modest. This year, the total Internet business -- including services, software and shopping -- will be less than $500 million, estimates Forrester Research Inc., a consulting firm.
But MCI and others hoping to profit from the Internet are looking at the future. By 2000, Forrester estimates that business on the Net will reach $10 billion or more.
MCI already has several Internet initiatives and a fast-growing, if modest, business in the field. MCI's revenue for supplying Internet access to companies and universities -- almost nil a year ago -- is now running at $1 million a month. The company's new Marketplace MCI service, where companies market their wares, now includes among its clients the specialty retailer Hammacher Schlemmer and Amtrak.
For its part, the News Corporation's commercial on-line service, the Delphi Internet Services Corporation, is a struggling fourth in the market with 160,000 subscribers in America. That places it far behind the leaders, America Online Inc., which has 2.5 million customers; the Compuserve unit of H& R Block with 1.9 million, and the Prodigy Services Company, a joint venture of I.B.M. and Sears, Roebuck & Company, with 1.6 million. Indeed Delphi is expected to be folded into MCI's information services business.
Many analysts said that the MCI-News Corporation linkup made sense, and that more such deals would follow. But analysts said much the same thing less than two years ago, when the Bell Atlantic Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc. planned to merge. When that plan fell apart, opinions were offered aplenty as to why it did not make much sense after all.
This time, analysts insist, both the rationale and profit prospects are stronger. The Bell Atlantic-Tele-Communications deal was devised when the thinking was that video-on-demand and interactive TV would be the big businesses on the so-called information highway.
But the technology for those services was -- and is -- years away. Internet technology is in place and affordable. What remains is to find a way to make money.
"They may not make a profit from this deal this year or next year," said Jonathan Yarmis, a vice president of the Gartner Group, a consulting firm in Stamford, Conn. "But the timing is right. The Internet is not a fad that is going to go away."

HEADLINE: Administration Rejects Plan As Based on False Promises

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
The White House locked horns with Congressional Republicans in the strongest terms yet today, denouncing their plans for balancing the Federal budget by the year 2002 as feckless and economically risky efforts to keep an "arbitrary campaign promise" and insisting that they drop their proposed tax cuts for the wealthy as a condition of negotiations.
With President Clinton away in Moscow, a parade of senior Administration officials appeared in the White House briefing room to accuse the Republicans of making "false promises" by pledging to cut taxes and spending so deeply. They warned that proposed cuts in the growth of the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs, could leave millions of children uninsured and impoverish the elderly and disabled. And they offered no hints of compromise or help. 
 "Look, this is the beginning of their process," Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, declared. "They've got to drop this tax cut for the wealthy. They haven't done that." Instead, he said, "They are basically saying, you know, we're going to balance this budget on the backs of the elderly and on the backs of children."
Opening a newly explicit line of attack, the President's chief economic policy adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, said the Republican goal of balancing the budget by 2002 was not only impractical but potentially unwise, because it risked prompting an economic slowdown.
Ms. Tyson, who heads the National Economic Council, said the Republicans were trying to balance the budget in seven years to keep "an arbitrary campaign promise" but "with no economic justification for why one wants to achieve that goal by that date." She asked: "Is that good for the macroeconomy? I think the answer is no. It exposes the macroeconomy to considerable downside risk."
Then, in the most pointed statement of a theme that has bubbled for weeks beneath the surface of the White House's arguments, Ms. Tyson argued that too much deficit reduction could be a bad thing.
"Any effort to reduce Government spending takes a dollar out of the economy, and when it takes a dollar out of the economy, that dollar means a dollar of reduction in demand in the economy, so it increases the contractionary risk on the economy," she said. "So if we hit a recession between now and 2002, the attempt to continue to balance the budget irrespective of the state of the economy exacerbates that risk and could aggravate the recession that the economy finds itself in."
On taking office in 1993, Mr. Clinton postponed his own campaign promise of tax relief for the middle class in favor of deeper deficit reduction. But after the Republican electoral sweep last fall, the White House forsook deeper deficit reduction in favor of new tax cuts for families with children and deductions for education.
Republicans have proposed tax cuts of $200 billion over five years, more than three times the amount in the White House plan, and Mr. Clinton contends that those tax cuts are fiscally irresponsible and unfairly skewed to the wealthy.
Mr. Panetta, Ms. Tyson and the officials who joined them -- the budget director Alice M. Rivlin and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala -- made almost no mention of other Republican budget proposals, which would eliminate Cabinet departments, mass transit subsidies and Mr. Clinton's pet national service program, Amercorps, among many others.
Instead, Mr. Panetta saved his most withering fire for the Republicans' overall goals, dismissing them as deceptive and irreconcilable efforts to fulfill promises in the Contract With America. "I think it's clear from the budgets that they have presented that those were false promises to the American people," he said. "In trying to fulfill their contract, the Republicans have broken our nation's contract to working families and to their parents."
Couching their arguments in terms intended to alarm the nation's most powerful political constituencies, Mr. Panetta and Dr. Shalala both took pains to emphasize that two-thirds of the costs of Medicaid, the Federal health insurance program for the poor, supported long-term care for the elderly.
Last year, the Administration itself proposed reductions in projected Medicare spending as part of its unsuccessful health care plan, but Dr. Shalala noted that the intent was to provide more Americans with insurance, albeit in different form.
Mr. Panetta repeated the Administration's position that cuts in Medicare and Medicaid should only be made as part of broader efforts to reshape health care. Referring to Republican plans, he said: "We'll see what the budget committees do. We'll see what the floor does. And then we'll look and see whether or not they in fact backed away from the commitments that we think simply cannot be fulfilled."

HEADLINE: Clinton Chooses Coke in Russia's Cola War

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 10

 BODY:
When President Clinton decided to make one detour from his Moscow summit-meeting agenda to publicize a successful American business investment in Russia, he chose Coke.
The President plans to visit a $65 million Coca-Cola plant near here on Thursday morning. Pepsi, which has already been losing market share to Coca-Cola in the former Soviet Union, was not thrilled with the decision. 
 Now that the competition between the two superpowers has ebbed into an edgy partnership, the frenzied rivalry between the world's two largest soft-drink manufacturers is perhaps one of the more ardent of the post-Communist era. Mr. Clinton's choice was an example of the effectiveness of the aggressive marketing that has helped Coke break through its rival's Communist-era dominance in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
The Coke plant in the town of Solnovo, 17 miles from downtown Moscow, is wholly owned by the Coca-Cola Company and even boasts its own "Coca-Cola University," where Russian employees are drilled in the fine points of the American soft-drink business.
That is one reason Mr. Clinton chose to visit it. Joint ventures in Russia with foreign investors have suffered bad publicity of late, the consequence of myriad disputes between Russian and American partners.
Pepsico Inc. also has a bottling plant outside Moscow, but it is a joint venture with a Russian partner. Pepsi executives declined to comment on the Presidential visit to their rival's plant.
The Coca-Cola cause has also been helped by the company's ardent courting of Mr. Clinton's representatives in Moscow. The American Ambassador to Russia, Thomas R. Pickering, visited the plant earlier this year.
And it didn't hurt that the gleaming new Coke plant, with its happy Russian workers, provided an excellent photo opportunity for the President -- or that it was situated so conveniently on the route of his motorcade back to the airport.
Historical forces could also be at work in Mr. Clinton's decision. In popular lore, Coca-Cola has been the drink of the Democrats and Pepsi-Cola the beverage of the Republicans. In recent years Coke has contributed more to Democratic candidates than Pepsi and Pepsi has contributed more to Republicans.
In World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt asked a Coca-Cola executive to help supply cola to the troops overseas, and before long Coke had set up bottling plants all over the world.
When the Communist state ran the Soviet economy, Pepsi developed a cozy relationship with the Kremlin, and by extension the Soviet bloc, after a visit to Moscow by Vice President Richard M. Nixon in 1959. During that visit, the chairman of Pepsi, Donald Kendall, met with Nikita S. Khrushchev.
In 1972, after Mr. Nixon had become President, Pepsi became the first foreign consumer product to be sold in the Soviet Union.
A few years later Coke found a champion in Jimmy Carter, who replaced Pepsi machines in the White House with Coke machines after he was elected President. The Carter connection may also have helped Coke to become one of the first foreign products sold in China after Chinese-American relations thawed in 1979.
"It's a great honor to have the President of the United States visit our company," said Michael A. O'Neill, head of the Coca-Cola operations in Russia. "And we will be bringing a certain amount of attention to that."
Coca-Cola has brought a great deal of attention to itself during the last four years, with splashy concert and sports promotions, ubiquitous nationwide television advertising and giant billboards and kiosks. Its red-and-white logo is plastered all over Moscow.
Pepsi is quite literally more underground. Pepsico made a deal with the Moscow city government in 1993 to put mobile food stands selling Pepsi, New York hot dogs and Taco Bell burritos in the busiest subway stations in Moscow.
Despite heavy marketing and advertising, Pepsi has lost ground to Coke throughout most of Eastern Europe and the rest of the former Communist world. In 1994 Coke took the lead in soft-drink sales in 10 of the 15 former republics of the Soviet Union, including Armenia, Lithuania and Georgia, breaking the lock that Pepsi held before the Communist bloc began to splinter in 1989.
Russia, with a population of more than 150 million, is where the competition is most acute. Pepsi still retains a strong lead, but Coca-Cola has narrowed the advantage of its rival to 2 to 1 last year, from 4 to 1 in 1993.
After Soviet Communism collapsed, Pepsi was left with a vast network of state-run bottling companies, most of which it kept. Coke, which introduced Fanta in Russia in 1979 and Coca-Cola in 1985, had only a limited presence before 1991. It moved far more quickly to cut its ties to state-run bottling companies and import its own manufacturing and marketing techniques than Pepsi.
When the Berlin wall fell in 1989, and people behind the Iron Curtain were suddenly infatuated with all things Western, Coke had the psychological advantage of seeming like an American soft drink. Pepsi had been around for so long that many Russian consumers saw it as a local beverage.
Pepsi has invested money in new equipment and advertising, but it has not invested nearly as much as Coke, which has poured $1.5 billion into Eastern Europe and $240 million into Russia alone.
But for all their money and energy, Pepsi and Coke combined have yet to overwhelm Russian consumers. American and European soft drinks have only captured 20 percent of the Russian market, and it is a pretty small market at that.
Rough industry estimates suggest that Russians drink 40 to 50 eight-ounce soft-drink servings per capita a year. In the United States, the figure for 1993 was 808 eight-ounce servings, said John Sicher, executive editor of Beverage Digest, a newsletter based in Greenwich, Conn.
And Russian consumers, and even soft-drink salespeople, can be cynical.
"Pepsi and Coke are about the same," said Nina Zikova, who is 48 and sells cigarettes and soft drinks from a cramped kiosk in Moscow, on which hangs a giant Coca-Cola logo. The company that owns her kiosk has an exclusive contract with Coca-Cola, but she said she was skeptical that there was a difference between her product and the rival one. She added with a shrug, "They all come from the same bottle."

HEADLINE: Clinton Rebuffs Senate on Letting Taiwan President Visit U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
The Administration today brushed aside a Senate vote on Tuesday that called on President Clinton to allow Taiwan's President to visit the United States.
State Department officials said that despite the Senate vote to lift the ban on his traveling here, the Administration would not grant a visa for Taiwan's leader, Lee Teng-hui, to attend a June ceremony in his honor at Cornell University, where he obtained a doctorate in agricultural economics in 1968. 
 Administration officials say allowing Mr. Lee to visit this country is not worth the price of touching off a major dispute with China, especially when the United States wants Beijing's backing as Washington presses North Korea to make good on an agreement to freeze its weapons-oriented nuclear program.
The dispute with Congress has put the Administration in a tight spot because while it is loath to offend Beijing, it does not want to appear to be ignoring the will of Congress.
Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican, who sponsored the non-binding resolution, said, "This is unmistakable proof that the U.S. Congress believes it is in our nation's best interest to improve relations with Taiwan and to do so by permitting the leader of our fifth-largest trading partner to at least spend the night on U.S. soil."
The Senate approved the resolution 97 to 1, the only dissenter being J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana. On May 2, the House approved a nearly identical resolution, 360 to 0.
The Administration moved last year to upgrade unofficial relations with Taipei by allowing meetings between higher-level officials than before. Nonetheless, the Administration is still withholding diplomatic recognition of the island in deference to China, which considers Taiwan a breakaway republic.
In 1979, the United States adopted a policy that recognizes Beijing as the sole Chinese Government.
John Ohta, a State Department spokesman, said the Administration was not rethinking its position, adding that allowing him to visit "would have serious consequences for United States foreign policy."
He said that because Mr. Lee is President, China would not act kindly if the United States granted him a visa "because a visit by a person of President Lee's title, whether or not the visit were termed private, would unavoidably be seen by the People's Republic of China as removing an essential element of unofficiality in the U.S.-Taiwan relationship."
Mr. Ohta emphasized that this policy has nothing to do with the Administration's view of President Lee's accomplishments. Washington has frequently lavished praise on him for consolidating democracy in Taiwan.
Last week the Chinese Embassy issued a statement saying, "We are firmly opposed to any visit by Lee Teng-Hui to the United States in whatever capacity, under whatever pretext and in whatever form."
Albert Lin, spokesman for Taiwan's office in Washington, said his nation "certainly appreciates the friendship and support of members of Congress."
As part of a policy review conducted last year, the State Department decided that President Lee's aircraft could make brief transit stops in the United States "for safety, comfort and convenience." Under that policy, his plane refueled in Hawaii last year.
Christine D. Shelly, a State Department spokeswoman, said anything beyond a short stopover "would be inconsistent with the informal character of our relations with Taiwan."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MOSCOW: THE POLICY;
The Growth of NATO: Will Moscow Go Along?

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 10

 BODY:
The big question on the table in Moscow this week was not Chechnya or even the sale of nuclear equipment to Iran.
It was this: Will Russia cooperate in the establishment of a stable security system for central Europe, where this century's two world wars originated? Or will it resist the prescription favored by the United States and its allies, the eastward expansion of NATO, sulk if it takes place anyway, and worsen the tensions developing between President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin and their Governments? 
 Mr. Clinton arrived in Moscow with no clear idea of the answer. He will leave with not much clearer an idea, but perhaps with a little more optimism.
The answer may ultimately depend as much on the dynamics of domestic politics as on considerations of foreign policy. The whole NATO issue shows every likelihood of becoming ensnared not only in the forthcoming Russian parliamentary and presidential elections but also in partisan skirmishing leading up to the American elections next year.
The political context in Russia, especially, is not encouraging.
"All the democrats in this country agree," said a European ambassador here, "that if NATO is alive as an issue when the elections come, it can only work to their great disadvantage. The black hats would use it to call the patriotism of the white hats into question. Can't you just see the debate on television?"
Today's meeting between the two leaders, each of whom felt deceived by the other at their last encounter in Budapest six months ago, produced expressions of good will all around. Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Clinton tried hard to put their mutual recriminations behind them, and the Russians agreed to participate in the Partnership for Peace, as they unexpectedly refused to do last December.
But in the main zone of contention -- the planned expansion of NATO to the east to include such former Soviet satellite states as Poland, which would bring it to the Russian border -- Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Clinton failed so completely to bridge their differences that they did what political leaders seldom do: they admitted it in plain language.
After "a never-ending meeting," the Russian leader said, it was clear that the two sides "still don't have answers to a number of questions -- our positions even remain unchanged."
More talk would be needed at the economic summit meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in June, he said, "and we may not be able to agree there;" if not, NATO would come up yet again late this year at ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the United Nations.
President Clinton's task here, a ranking American official said beforehand, was to convince President Yeltsin that the United States sought NATO expansion not to isolate Moscow but to reassure the central Europeans, and that Russia would be brought into the post-cold-war security system on another track.
"Their willingness to keep talking is encouraging, I suppose," the same official said this evening when asked if he saw reason for optimism. "But we clearly didn't make a sale. It's going to be hard, though not impossible."
The United States is determined to press on, with or without Russian approval. To put the matter more baldly than American officials like to, they have decided that it is more urgent to deal with the worries of the central Europeans than to mollify the Russians -- a decision of fundamental strategic importance.
But what they hope, says Robert Legvold, an expert on Russia at Columbia University, is "to have their cake and eat it at the same time."
To that end, the Administration has been offering the Russians various forms of what it calls "compensation," such as closer linkage between NATO and Russia, a possible relaxation in the time schedule for expansion and greater importance for other European institutions and the Russian role in them.
In his remarks today, Mr. Clinton emphasized one of them, the Partnership for Peace. He said he would "encourage the beginning of the NATO-Russia dialogue" in the context of the Partnership. He added, "There must be a special relationship between NATO and Russia."
But Mr. Yeltsin emphasized another group, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (as he had in an interview last week with Time magazine, when he said, "I think diplomats should focus their efforts on this, rather than discussing terms for the expansion of NATO"). In that group, Russia is on an equal footing with the other members, not in a junior role as in the Partnership.
"We hope that eventually we can just agree to disagree," another American official commented. "The Russians would say that they don't buy NATO expansion. We would say we don't grant Russia a veto on NATO expansion. But we wouldn't come to blows over it."
An open breach over NATO would have serious consequences. It could complicate efforts to win ratification of the second strategic arms reduction treaty, strengthen the hand of the Soviet military and weaken Mr. Yeltsin. Ultimately, if the Soviet Union became angry enough over expansion, it could conceivably lead to the division of Europe into two camps once again.
The Russian Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel Grachev, has already taken the position that NATO expansion would constitute a hostile act against Russia. Earlier this month, he announced that Russia would not carry out its obligation under the 1990 agreement on conventional forces in Europe if NATO expands.
Mr. Legvold, the Columbia scholar, said there was a real risk in the United States as well that "political forces will take over that are not looking for ways to manage the relationship as much as for ways to score points."
Threats have not materialized yet in Washington over the NATO issue. But several American officials have recently said a Russian nuclear sale to Iran could endanger Russian hopes to become a full member of the Group of Seven wealthy industrialized nations and other international economic institutions, and Representative Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, has warned of a cutoff in various kinds of American assistance to Russian in the event of a nuclear sale.
Mr. Clinton urged that Americans and Russians both take a broader view.
"As with any sort of relationship, there will be difference of opinion," he said. "Occasionally, there will even be occasions when our interests are different. I think that we all know there may be consequences to having different positions and different actions.
"But I think we should be quite careful in using the language of threats in a relationship that in the last two years has made the world a safer place."

HEADLINE: A Double-Edged Sword for Detroit

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 10

 BODY:
High American tariffs on Japanese luxury cars would hit the Japanese auto makers in their tenderest spot.
But Japanese auto makers and their dealers could limit the impact of the tariffs, at least in the short term. The most effective step: accelerate imports to increase inventories before the United States Government imposes trade sanctions, as it said it would today. The Nissan Motor Company said it was considering that move. 
 Overstocking cars could give the Japanese companies more than two months' breathing room, perhaps enough time for trade negotiators to resolve their differences.
Once the tariffs bite, though, the Japanese will be caught in a terrible bind, without much freedom either to absorb the increased costs or to pass them on to their customers. Because of the surging yen, prices on Japanese luxury cars have already soared even higher than have prices on European imports.
As a result, the likely buyers of Japanese luxury cars are already turning to reinvigorated European auto makers in a slow migration that could become a stampede.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said today that Washington would impose sanctions on Japan, although he would not describe how. Luxury cars are believed to be at the top of the list.
The Big Three auto makers and the United Automobile Workers union enthusiastically endorsed the Administration's strategy today. But in the short term, the Big Three would gain little from tariffs on Japanese luxury cars.
Instead, Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Daimler-Benz, and BMW, which have restyled their cars and lowered prices in response to Japanese competition, are poised to be the big winners.
The Japanese modeled their luxury cars on European sedans, and their buyers want the same kinds of performance, design and social cachet. Those buyers are generally in their mid-40's, at least 10 years younger than typical Cadillac or Lincoln buyers.
"I don't see the benefits flowing to Lincoln or Cadillac," said Susan Jacobs, president of Jacobs & Associates, an auto consultant in Rutherford, N.J. "It's a big opportunity for the Europeans to bring these people back."
Citing the loss of customers to European makes, dealers with Japanese luxury franchises were quick to predict doom. "Depending on the size of the tariff, we could go out of business," said B. F. Curry Jr., owner of Curry Acura in Scarsdale, N.Y. "Our employees would lose their jobs."
But dealerships generally make more money on parts and service and the sale of used cars than they do on new cars. Asked how long he could subsist on income from those other operations, Mr. Curry said, "not a year" -- a lifetime during such trade brinksmanship.
Still, quickly increasing inventories of Japanese cars could prevent wholesale defections of buyers. Even once the list of sanctions is announced, the companies have at least a 30-day comment period, and probably longer, to import cars unencumbered by the tariffs.
"We're looking at increasing inventory," said Don Spetner, vice president of corporate communications for Nissan North America. Dealers of Nissan's luxury line, Infiniti, have only 34 days' worth of inventory now, because of strong sales this spring after Infiniti announced special incentive programs to make room for a new car, the I30.
Acura, Honda Motor Company's luxury line, said today that it was not considering raising inventory. But at the end of March, its dealers' had on average almost three months' supply, according to the trade publication Automotive News.
Lexus has only a 42 days' supply, a spokesman said. And on Monday, Toshimi Onishi, an executive vice president of Toyota Motor and a member of its board, rejected the idea of bulking up inventories after a speech here.
"Customers would think it was not honorable," he said, speaking through an interpreter. For that reason, Toyota's board last month decided against raising inventories to prepare for tariffs, said James R. Olson, vice president for external affairs at Toyota's American sales arm.
Such honor could come at a high price, should the Japanese companies try to absorb the cost of the tariffs, which could be as much as 100 percent of the price of a vehicle. "You really can't pass the tariff on to the consumer, because you'd kill your dealer body," said Christopher W. Cedergren, senior vice president with the Autopacific Group, a California consultancy.
But Ms. Jacobs, of Jacobs & Associates, said the Japanese companies would have to pass the cost on. They have already drastically raised prices, she pointed out, a sign they could not afford to absorb the strengthening of the yen. "That's why I'm assuming the tariff would have to come through," she said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Visit To Ukraine Is Welcome

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine

 BODY:
When the White House proposed that President Clinton stop here for a full day on his way home from the Moscow summit meeting, Ukrainian officials were flattered. But when the White House proposed that he spend a night in the capital, Ukrainian officials were slightly alarmed.
Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko fretted publicly that Kiev did not have enough suitable hotel rooms to accommodate the American President and his entourage. 
 But the White House, eager to underscore its warm relations with the Ukrainians, accepted pot luck in a Government guest house for the President, his wife and top aides; the rest of the troupe will be in the hotels, living in a style to which they are unaccustomed.
The Clinton Administration views Ukraine as one of its big foreign policy successes. Under the leadership of President Leonid Kuchma, elected last July, the once isolated and economically ruined Ukraine has turned pro-Western and pro-economic-reform, and American officials expect Mr. Clinton's visit in Kiev to serve as a needed pick-me-up after a difficult summit meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin.
"There are no outstanding differences between us," William G. Miller, the American Ambassador to Ukraine, said the other day. "President Kuchma and President Clinton will discuss how to enable the partnership to move onto an even more effective level."
Hopes for closer relations are high, especially in light of Ukraine's recent record.
Moscow has horrified Washington with its plan to sell nuclear reactors to Iran. Kiev heeded Washington and agreed to give up its nuclear weapons and sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
Russian economic reform is under siege from Mr. Yeltsin's restive opposition. This year, Mr. Kuchma pushed his radical economic reform package, crafted with the help of Western advisers, through a hostile but divided Parliament.
In contrast to Moscow's bloody, unpopular war in the rebellious region of Chechnya, Kiev is credited with managing a quiet, nonviolent clampdown on the separatist region of Crimea.
The blossoming romance between Kiev and Washington has infected ordinary Ukrainian citizens, who unlike their Russian neighbors are neither blase nor cynical about a state visit of an American President.
A recent public opinion survey of 600 Kiev residents showed that 85 percent of the respondents viewed the visit as "important."
"It's a huge deal for us to have President Clinton here," said Yuri Kravchenko, 28, an unemployed factory worker who was browsing in an outdoor market in Kiev. "And not just because we need foreign aid. He will see for himself that we are a real country now."
The Ukrainian economy, while still fragile, has improved slightly since the darkest days of free-falling productivity and hyperinflation. Signs of development are proliferating: several hard-currency supermarkets and restaurants have opened in the last year. The first tiny steps toward privatization of state property have begun.
The Ukrainian Government welcomes financial assistance, and even the advice that comes with it. Washington has pledged more than $900 million in aid and technical assistance to Ukraine for 1994 and 1995, making Ukraine the fourth-largest recipient of American foreign aid.
Western economic advisers are jubilant about Ukraine's embrace of radical reform. But average Ukrainians, facing rising prices as the Government seeks to obey International Monetary Fund requirements by reducing subsidies, say they are not yet feeling the improvement.
"I think things will get better," said Tatiana Kudriatseva, 57, whose pension pays her $13 a month, only a few dollars more than her monthly rent. "But it is going to take 30 years."
And despite its flirtation with Washington, Ukraine, which proclaimed independence in 1991, remains very much married to Russia in everything but name. With plenty of coal but no oil or gas of its own, Ukraine owes Russia more than $4 billion, mostly in energy bills.
Relations between Kiev and Moscow are particularly bitter these days as negotiations over Crimea and its ethnic Russian majority, and particularly over the division of the former Soviet fleet in the Black Sea, have bogged down.
Ukraine has hinted that it would like Mr. Clinton to exert pressure on Moscow to make concessions on those issues, though the United States is unlikely to risk further alienating Moscow.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Suggests Smaller Benefit Adjustments

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
As part of their plan to eliminate the Federal budget deficit, House Republicans today recommended a reduction in the annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security and other Government benefits, starting in 1999.
At the same time, Republicans on the House Budget Committee suggested vast changes in Medicare, which would increase costs for many elderly beneficiaries. 
 More than 43 million people receive Social Security, and 37 million are enrolled in Medicare. The annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security is based on changes in the Consumer Price Index. Republicans said their proposal was justified because the price index, in its current form, overstated inflation by as much as 1.5 percentage points. Many economists agree that there is some overstatement, but the amount is in dispute.
Lobbyists for the elderly said the proposals violated the Republicans' campaign pledge to make no changes in Social Security. Martin A. Corry, director of Federal affairs at the American Association of Retired Persons, said: "Prior to and after the elections, Republicans made unequivocal statements that Social Security was off the table. Today's proposal is a repudiation of that campaign promise." He predicted "a firestorm" of opposition to any reduction in the inflation adjustment.
The average Social Security benefit for retired workers is $698 a month. In recent years, the annual cost-of-living adjustment, or has been around 3 percent, and in the next decade it is expected to be 3 to 4 percent. The House Republicans would make a one-time permanent reduction of six-tenths of 1 percentage point in the Consumer Price Index, with a corresponding reduction in the inflation adjustment for 1999. This would reduce the basic amount on which future adjustments are calculated, and the cumulative effect could be substantial, totaling several hundred dollars a year for the average beneficiary over five years.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which computes the Consumer Price Index, was already planning a revision for 1998. But the Congressional Budget Office said this revision was likely to slow the growth of the index by just two-tenths of 1 percentage point.
The Medicare proposals unveiled today by Representative John R. Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, are far more detailed and specific than those suggested by Senate Republicans, who called for a bipartisan commission to deal with the politically explosive issue.
Republicans on the House Budget Committee recommended three dozen ways to slow the growth of Federal Medicare costs. They include higher premiums, deductibles and co-payments for beneficiaries and strong new incentives for them to join health maintenance organizations, which provide comprehensive care in return for a fixed monthly fee.
Mr. Kasich said the Republican proposals would "expand health care choices for the elderly." But Mr. Corry said the Republicans were "creating a coercive environment in which Medicare beneficiaries will be herded into managed care and out of traditional fee-for-service arrangements."
Under one of the leading options, Medicare beneficiaries would receive Federal vouchers worth a fixed amount, around $5,100 a year, to enroll in an H.M.O. or other private health plan. They would have to use their own money to make up the difference if the cost exceeded the amount of the vouchers, but they could keep most of the savings if they chose less expensive plans.
The Republicans also recommend a stiff financial penalty for new Medicare beneficiaries who refuse to join H.M.O.'s. "Beginning in 1999, all new enrollees choosing Medicare fee-for-service would pay a premium $20 higher than that of current Medicare beneficiaries," one of the Republican recommendations says. The premium is now $46 a month.
The House Republicans would also reduce payments to doctors and hospitals, especially teaching hospitals and those that serve large numbers of low-income patients.
The Budget Committee recommendations are not binding on other committees. The Ways and Means Committee, for example, could choose other policies to achieve the savings required in the annual budget resolution.
But the options recommended today by Mr. Kasich were developed with House Republican leaders and are widely seen as a road map for the type of changes that will be endorsed by the full House and Senate as they try to shore up the finances of Medicare and revamp the program for millions of baby boomers who will retire in the next century.
Confidential documents from the House Budget Committee show that the Republicans are also recommending these changes:
*Double the amount that beneficiaries must pay for doctors' services before Medicare coverage begins. The annual deductible, now $100, would be raised to $200 and then increased automatically to keep pace with the growth of the program. The deductible has been raised only three times in the 30-year history of Medicare.
*Increase the monthly $46 premium by $5 in each of the next four years, then by $6 in 2000 and in each of the following two years.
*Charge higher premiums for beneficiaries with incomes exceeding $70,000 a year. The premium would more than triple, to $164 a month, for individuals with incomes of more than $95,000 a year and couples with more than $115,000.
*Charge patients for a portion of the cost of home health care provided to elderly people residing in their own homes. Republicans said such a charge would discourage overuse of home health services, but lobbyists for the elderly said it would be a tax on frail elderly people.
The House Republicans are proposing similar charges for the use of medical laboratories and skilled nursing homes.

HEADLINE: Black Executives Forming Group to Defend Minority Programs

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
A group of black business executives said today that they were forming a political action committee and hiring a lobbyist to fight efforts to eliminate or modify affirmative action programs, including those that set aside a percentage of Government contracts for minority-owned companies.
"Until now, the voice of black business has been largely silent on the twin issues of affirmative action and minority set asides," Earl G. Graves, publisher of Black Enterprise Magazine, said at a news conference. "Today, that changes." 
 Mr. Graves, who was joined by other black executives, said that the group was "drawing a line in the sand" and that there would be "no retreat" on affirmative action. The group is made up of the Black Enterprise 100, the largest black-owned companies in the country.
"Until we get to the point in this country where there is truly a level playing field," said Maceo Sloan, head of the Sloan Financial Group, "where a black business can go to a bank, for example, and be judged, in terms of loans, on the same basis that the majority business in this country are judged; where we have the same access to capital that they have and where there truly is a level playing field, we will very vigorously oppose the effort that is going on right to eliminate all the affirmative action programs."
The executives' effort comes at a time when affirmative action programs, especially the set-aside ones, are under increasing attack, mainly by Republicans. The White House is reviewing all Federal affirmative action efforts, and President Clinton is expected to announce the results of the review soon. Administration officials have privately said that Government set-aside programs have received the most critical look.
Earlier this year, Congress voted to end a tax break for companies that sell television stations and cable systems to minorities. The program came under intense criticism as a result of a proposed sale by Viacom Inc., a New York-based media giant, to a group of investors headed by Frank Washington, a black entrepreneur from California.
Critics of the sale said it was an affirmative action program intended to help minority millionaires.
But today the black executives said that such criticism reflected a double standard because there are several Federal programs like farm subsidies that help well-off individuals and businesses.
"What about all the thousands of millionaires who are majority business owners, and no one raises the issue of that being un-American?" Mr. Graves said. "When we start to do it, all of a sudden, let's change the rules."
Mr. Graves said the 100 largest black-owned companies had combined sales of about $11.7 billion last year and employed about 47,000 people, indicating that if the group could muster its financial resources, it could have significant political impact.
The executives said today that they had not yet solicited all the top black businesses to contribute to the political action committee, which will be called Mobilization for Economic Opportunity. But Mr. Graves said he did not think it would be difficult to persuade them to reach into their pockets.
"Whether you talk about L.A. or San Francisco, or Chicago, or Detroit, or Atlanta or New York, the issues are the same," he said. "It would seem to me we're not going to have a very hard selling point to push here."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Prices Retreat From Recent Highs

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities retreated yesterday, but not before testing recent highs.
Despite the setback, traders and analysts said bonds were still capable of going higher. The market, they said, was weighed down yesterday by a poor response to an auction of 10-year notes and by a Federal Reserve survey of business activity that was not as weak as had been hoped. Market participants were also hesitant to buy ahead of reports on producer prices today and consumer prices tomorrow, they said. 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 22/32, to 107 26/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7 percent, from 6.94 percent on Tuesday. Still, the yield is at its lowest point in more than a year.
Yesterday's auction of new 10-year notes "was one of the worst auctions in 10-year note history," said Theodore Ake, government trading manager at Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago.
The average yield at the auction was 6.60 percent, down from 7.54 percent in February and the lowest since Feb. 9, 1994, when the yield was 5.92 percent.
But Mr. Ake cautioned against reading too much into the poor institutional and retail demand for the notes, noting that many dealers did not have customers lined up ahead of the auction.
"Prices have changed so rapidly over the past several days; few had bothered to book, or line up, customers for the 10-year auction," he said.
"The dealers have been fighting this market," Mr. Ake added. "The last thing they want to do is load up the boat and buy a bunch of securities ahead of important numbers," he said, referring to the producer prices and consumer prices data as well as today's report on April retail sales.
Some traders were also concerned that prices might have peaked, a view that was reinforced by a report that showed some pickup amid an otherwise sluggish economy. The Federal Reserve's quarterly survey of regional business activity, known as the beige book, largely confirmed a widespread slowdown although it did find some gains in the Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City and Minneapolis areas.
Recent data showing that the economy is slowing at a pace that can stifle inflation, which erodes the value of bonds, has driven a powerful rally in the market. On Tuesday, rates fell below 7 percent for the first time in 14 months, and some traders and analysts expect the rally to resume soon.
"I don't think we have broken the market's bullish psychology today," Mr. Ake of Kemper Securities said. "There is still a positive spin on the data, so the funademental factors are still in play.
Some fund managers also noted that the bond rally was also feeding itself as declining interest rates prompted managers of portfolios with mortgage-backed bonds to buy long-term government debt. As a result of lower rates, more homeowners are expected to refinance their mortgages, which means there will be an increase in the number of redemptions of mortgages backing bonds. To offset the redemptions, the portfolio managers are buying Treasury bonds to maintain their presence in long maturities until the mortgage market settles down.
The market turns its attention today to the April Producer Price Index, which is exepcted to show a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent and a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent in its core rate, which excludes food and energy, according to Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 10-year notes:

Gasoline Prices Rise as Workers Strike Brazilian Oil Refineries

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Gasoline prices rose yesterday as a strike by oil workers in Brazil and refinery problems in Ohio and Louisiana threatened to reduce supplies.
On other commodity markets, silver prices continued their slide and cotton fell. The Commodity Research Bureau index gained 0.17 point, to 231.18. 
 Defying a court order, 42,000 oil workers stayed off the job in Brazil yesterday, vowing to further slow refinery output. About 7.5 percent of United States gasoline imports come from Brazil.
Meanwhile, a fire yesterday morning caused British Petroleum P.L.C. to slow operations at its 121,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Toledo, Ohio. Heavy rains are also threatening refineries in Louisiana.
Gasoline inventories in the United States are already 5 percent below a year ago, the American Petroleum Institute said after the market closed on Tuesday. Traders are forecasting stronger demand this summer than last year.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline for June delivery rose 0.73 cent, to 63.29 cents a gallon. Heating oil for June delivery rose 0.81 cent, to 49.95 cents a gallon. The gains raised June crude prices by 14 cents, to $19.75 a barrel.
Silver prices fell for a second day after a rally in the bond market indicated that investors were not concerned about inflation. Investors often buy silver and other precious metals when inflation threatens the value of other assets. Bond prices slipped back yesterday, but silver continued to decline.
"The rallies in the dollar, the stock market and the bond market imply inflation is not a problem," said Jim Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc. in New York. "When the paper assets are doing so well, silver is not what you want to own."
July silver fell 5.5 cents, to $5.445 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange of New York. Other precious metals also fell, with June gold falling 10 cents, to $384.20 an ounce. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, July platinum fell $1.50, to $431.90 an ounce.
Cotton for delivery in July, before this summer's crop is harvested, surged its 2-cent daily limit amid optimism that prices below $1 a pound would revive export sales.
After trading as high as $1.082 a pound on April 25, July cotton fell to less than $1 a pound on Monday for the first time in almost a month.
High prices have slowed sales to mills in South Korea and Indonesia, traditional buyers of American cotton. With the recent drops, analysts said, demand immediately grew.
The July cotton contract rose 2 cents, to $1.0029 a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange.

HEADLINE: The Fed Makes It Official: Slower Growth

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
A periodic Federal Reserve survey confirmed today what markets and economists had been saying in stages -- that the economy was slowing down, growing at a weaker pace than it did last year in most regions of the country.
The Fed released its survey of business activity, known as the beige book, which also indicated that inflation pressure was benign even though the price of goods in the early stages of production was rising. 
 The report was prepared for the next meeting on May 23 of the central bank's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. It covered conditions in March and April.
Analysts expect the Fed panel to leave key interest rates unchanged, with most evidence pointing to an economic slowdown -- the Fed's goal in increasing rates seven times from February 1994 through the beginning of February 1995.
Most of the 12 Federal Reserve banks said conditions in their regions reflected "continuing gains in economic activity from March through April, but at a somewhat slower pace."
The exceptions were in the Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City and Minneapolis areas, where there were reports of solid gains.
The Fed's most recent previous survey had described economic activity as moderating over the winter.
The Federal Reserve survey cited widespread reports of rising commodity and industrial prices. But in most cases, the report said, the increases were "moderate or not accelerating," and were not being passed along to consumers.
The survey added that "despite tight labor markets in some sectors or regions, wage pressures were described as moderate in most areas."
The economy expanded at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the first three months this year, well below an annual rate of 5.1 percent in the last quarter of 1994.
The new Fed survey confirmed that consumer spending was slowing, with most districts reporting sluggish growth. Yet the Chicago and Minneapolis regions reported a pickup in sales and in New York, Cleveland and Atlanta, the overall pace of growth was brisker in April than in March. Manufacturing remained strong in many areas, propelled by business investment.

Huge Gas Rig Begins Journey in Norway

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: OSLO, May 10

 BODY:
Ten powerful tugs began towing the world's largest concrete drilling platform to deep water today, marking a turning point for Norwegian energy.
The giant platform is the centerpiece of the $5 billion Troll gas field on the Norwegian continental shelf. With several important oilfields beginning to run low, Norway is turning to natural gas. 
 "We'll be more than doubling our gas exports through the year 2005, and that is counting only volumes already contracted," said Jens Stoltenberg, Industry and Energy Minister. "We don't know exactly when Norway will begin to produce more gas than oil, but that can take place rather early in the next century."
Production in the Troll field is scheduled to begin next year. The platform under tow will eventually allow Norway to deliver one-third of the gas consumed in Germany, France and Belgium, and smaller amounts to Spain, the Netherlands and Austria, officials said.
Gas covered by the Troll contracts actually started flowing in October 1993 with completion of a 500-mile pipeline from the smaller Sleipner field to Zeebrugge, Belgium. Sleipner gas will continue supplementing the Troll deliveries once the Troll platform begins operation.
All told, Troll gas valued at $100 billion at current prices is to be delivered under European contracts through 2022. Eighty-five percent of the revenue will flow to the Norwegian state, helping maintain one of Europe's highest standards of living. A.S. Norske Shell, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell, spent four years building the Troll rig in a fjord near Stavanger. It stands 1,549 feet tall. By contrast, the world's tallest building, the Sears Tower in Chicago, is 1,454 feet tall.
"When the contracts were signed in 1986," said Simon Blakey of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris, "this was known as the Norwegian Man on the Moon Project because of its 10-year time frame and the commitment of resources."
Today, 10 tugs generating 130,000 horsepower towed the rig north to the Troll field, 50 miles northwest of Bergen. The 200-mile trip is to take five to seven days at speeds of one to two knots, depending on weather. At a place where the North Sea is 994 feet deep, valves will be opened and water will pour into the rig's hollow concrete base. The ballasted weight of 1.2 million tons will push the structure 36 feet into the seabed.
Forty wells will radiate from the base of the platform, reaching more than 4,000 feet under the seabed. Norske Shell says Troll is the largest concrete-based platform and the heaviest object ever transported. The Shell Oil Company's steel Bullwinkle platform in the Gulf of Mexico is slightly taller, but at 75,000 tons spindly by comparison.
Norway says its oil production will peak next year. Natural gas production will increase yearly until 2005 and level off at six billion cubic feet a day, an extraction rate allowing at least 50 years' production. The Troll platform, to be operated by the state-owned company Statoil, will supply more than half the total.
In last year's referendum debate on joining the European Union, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland warned voters that Norway's oil age was ending and that membership in the union was needed to diversify the economy. Opponents prevailed in part by stressing the largely untapped gas reserves.
The Troll project had its origin in cold war tensions. When Western Europe planned a major increase in natural gas purchases from the Soviet Union in 1985, the Reagan Administration feared Soviet leverage over Europe. It banned the export of American equipment for pipelines. The eventual compromise was twofold: a ceiling on Soviet gas imports to Europe and the Troll gas agreements of 1986.
Western Europe's gas consumption is expected to increase 2 to 3 percent annually through 2010, Mr. Blakey, the consultant, said. In that period, he said, Norway is expected to surpass Algeria and the Netherlands to become the No. 2 gas supplier to Europe, behind Russia.

Dollar Gains on U.S. Stance Against Japan Trading Practices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday after the Clinton Administration said it would file a a broad legal challenge to Japan's trading practices.
The dollar also hit a 10-day high against the German mark, buoyed by a continued selloff of marks that traders stockpiled before France's election and by further indications that the Germany might cut interest rates. 
 "It was a really strong day for the dollar," said Steven Flanagan, vice president at Credit Agricole in New York. "It was really trading toward the top of its ranges."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 83.80 yen from 83.35 yen on Tuesday.
The dollar rose after the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, announced that President Clinton had authorized the filing of a formal complaint against Japan with the newly formed World Trade Organization. That announcement followed last week's breakdown of talks between the two countries aimed at opening Japan's auto market.
Mr. Kantor also said the United States would soon publish a list of Japanese products that could be hit with punitive tariffs.
"The market has been waiting to see what Clinton's action will be and it liked the tough stance he seems to be taking," said Rick Porter, a vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York.
In other currency trading, the dollar sustained its rally against the mark as traders continued to unload the German currency. In New York, the dollar rose to 1.3888 marks from 1.3805 marks.
Many foreign-exchange traders had purchased marks ahead of last week's election in France as a precautionary step because of questions about whether the new Government would be committed to a strong franc. But the victory of Jacques Chirac, the conservative Mayor of Paris, has satisfied the foreign-exchange markets. The dollar was further bolstered against the mark yesterday by comments from a German central banker, Hans-Jurgen Krupp, who said that another easing of official German interest rates was conceivable given the "improved monetary situation."
His comments followed similar remarks by two other Bundesbank council members on Tuesday. The Bundesbank's policy makers are to next meet on May 18.
Lower rates would weaken the mark, and thereby help the dollar, by making mark-denominated investments less attractive.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
One answer to overfishing: privatize the fisheries.

DATELINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WILL fresh fish someday become a delicacy as rare and expensive as, say, truffles? Not likely: the most valuable species could always be cultivated on fish farms. But the collapse of fishing on the once-rich Georges Bank and last winter's near-war between Spain and Canada over the remaining crumbs suggest that the days of relying on the oceans as a primary source of food are numbered.
That was the buzz, if not the formal conclusion, from assorted economists, scientists and bureaucrats assembled last weekend at Columbia University to discuss what was billed as the "current crisis in commercial fisheries." For while fishing remains an enormous industry worldwide, fisheries are being decimated by a combination of politics, technological change and myopia. 
 The problem with commercial fishing is what the environmentalist Garrett Hardin labeled "the tragedy of the commons." The ocean, like the common pasture land in medieval villages, belongs to everyone -- and therefore to no one. Just as it paid peasants to let their animals eat grass down to the roots, it pays fishermen to catch as many fish as possible as quickly as possible,
But anyone with the job of telling peasants to stop doing what they had always done would have had it easy compared with today's custodians of the fisheries. In the last half century, technology has radically increased the capacity of fishing boats to vacuum everything and anything from the sea. And where fishermen lacked capital to buy such boats, they had the influence to persuade governments to subsidize their purchase.
The relentless drive to overfish stalled in the 1970's, when Ottawa and Washington asserted control of 200-mile coastal fishery zones to prevent East bloc trawlers from decimating the Georges Bank. But local fishermen quickly filled the breach. In 1992 Canada was forced to close the Newfoundland cod fishery in the face of collapsing harvests; New England followed two years later. Landings of Atlantic cod fell by two-thirds between 1970 and 1993.
This fiasco is a harbinger of more to come for an industry inclined to eat its seed corn. "Two dollars was spent for every dollar's worth of fish caught worldwide in 1993," said Suzanne Iudicello of the Center for Marine Conservation. Over all, a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization report estimates that the industry is losing $50 billion a year.
Fishing capacity is now falling since many boat owners can barely buy diesel fuel, let alone replace aging equipment. But there is no hidden hand to lead this market to the promised land of maximum sustainable catches achieved with minimum effort. That is why economists have been so attracted by the idea of privatizing fishing rights.
If the right to catch a fixed percentage of the annual harvest were assigned to individual fishermen, the problem of the commons would be solved. Incentives to overfish would dissolve -- indeed, those with quotas would have a strong stake in sustaining the fishery, much the way owners of farmland have a stake in preventing erosion.
Privatization works, argues Lee Anderson, an economist who is chairman of the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council -- and is quick to point out his views are his own. The Mid-Atlantic Council has privatized harvests of two species with great success, sustaining yields while cutting the number of boats needed by 90 percent. But privatization remains a fighting word for most fishermen, in part because it destroys their self-image as rugged individualists, but mostly because it means a lot of them would have to settle for jobs on shore.
Adding to the grief of those seeking rational management of fisheries is the difficulty of predicting sustainable harvests. For marine biologists now believe that nature as well as man can produce enormous fluctuations in fish populations. "A lot of people have lost sight of this great unknown," said Michael Sissenwine, the chief scientist for the National Marine Fisheries Service.
In a better world, suggests Bill Schrank, an economist at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, the size of permanent fishing fleets would be tied to very conservative estimates of sustainable harvests, and this would be very small. In good times, outsiders would be permitted to fish, too, presumably for a price. But in lean times, there would be no army of fishermen with overdue mortgage payments howling about their sacred right to catch every last fish in the ocean.
Is such a world possible? Richard Cooper, an economist at Harvard, is skeptical. "Fishermen have dug themselves into a very deep hole," he said.
But the conferees at Columbia were less pessimistic, if only because they believe that desperation is the mother of invention. "The current situation is so bad," concluded Giulio Pontecorvo, an economist at Columbia, "that the fishing industry may finally be ready for change."

HEADLINE: HOUSE COMMITTEE ISSUES 7-YEAR PLAN TO ERASE DEFICIT

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Thursday, May 11

 BODY:
The House Budget Committee voted largely along party lines early this morning to approve a seven-year blueprint for future Federal budgets that would wipe out the deficit by the year 2002, largely by reining in health care costs and abolishing hundreds of agencies.
In this morning's 24-to-17 vote, one Democrat, Representative Mike Parker of Mississippi, voted with the Republicans. The Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee released their own budget-balancing plan on Tuesday and debated it on Wednesday but quit before taking a vote. 
 While the House and Senate proposals reach the same end, the House blueprint outlines broader reductions in Federal programs and greater savings than does the Senate's. The House plan must dig deeper to pay for $340 billion in tax cuts that the representatives passed in April.
The size of the House spending reduction would be $1.1 trillion to $1.4 trillion, depending on which projection of future Federal spending it is measured against: President Clinton's own budget proposal, a projection by the Congressional Budget Office or a forecast of spending based on current law.
The tax cuts came in for the strongest denunciation yet from the White House, which insisted again on Wednesday that it would not seriously negotiate over spending reductions until Republicans abandon those parts of the tax package that benefit the wealthy. [Page B12.]
But the Republicans did not need Democratic help to move the House budget plan out of the committee, and they are not likely to need help to push a final compromise version through Congress later this month.
With President Clinton's budget a dead letter in a Republican Congress, the resolutions debated this week will be the foundation for the Federal budget that will take effect next Oct. 1 and for years beyond.
But much work lies between today's action and that budget. While the House panel endorsed the principle of the cuts and even suggested many, Republicans still must vote to make specific reductions, many in politically popular programs.
"We've gone a long way toward reversing the trend of higher taxes and bigger Government for most Americans," the panel's chairman, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, said of his budget as his hearing opened. "It is a revolution. It is a bold plan. We will downsize Government, shift power away from this city, give Americans a tax cut."
The Democrat Mr. Kasich replaced as chairman, Representative Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota, expressed admiration at Mr. Kasich's political feat of uniting Republicans behind a budget chock full of painful spending cuts. But he had no kind words for the budget itself.
Government must address society's central problem, the growing gulf between the very rich and the very poor, Mr. Sabo said. But "I frankly find that the basic, fundamental thrust of this document is one that escalates rather than solves the problem," he said. "This is a document that is moving us backwards."
Outside the chambers, lines of legislative aides and lobbyists snaked down halls, awaiting a chance to sit in on the conflict. Inside the hearing room, Republicans set the mood by hanging over the committee leaders' heads a digital "National Debt Clock," which ticked off a $38,158 increase in the nation's $4.7 trillion debt every four seconds. By the time, the 14-hour hearing finished around 1 A.M., the clock had added nearly $500 million.
Lobbyists for the elderly attacked one plan that would keep Medicare spending from rising as fast as projected and another that would have the effect of changing Social Security cost-of-living allowances. That, they said, broke a Republican pledge to exempt Social Security from cuts.
Democrats lustily joined them, condemning the reductions -- especially those in the politically sacred Medicare program -- as cruel assaults on the poor and elderly. In the Senate, they forced Republicans into difficult votes by offering amendments, all rejected, to scale back spending reductions in Medicare and other popular programs.
But the Democrats were badly hobbled by the fact that neither they nor the White House had any alternative proposal that would both erase the deficit and keep the programs they support intact.
For their part, Republicans repeatedly accused the Democrats of fiscal demagogy. They noted that while the House proposal would indeed spend about 15 percent less on projected Medicare spending through 2002, it would still allow spending to increase by 5.4 percent a year over current levels.
The House plan does make cuts from current levels in many programs and abolishes more than a few. Some parts make the budget offered by the Senate Budget Committee chairman, Pete Domenici of New Mexico, seem pallid.
The Senate plan would eliminate the Commerce Department; the House plan abolishes it and the Departments of Education and Energy, too. The Senate plan would pare $250 billion from projected spending on Medicare; the House plan ups the ante to $270 billion. The Senate would allot $100 billion to foreign affairs, a 20 percent reduction from what is envisioned under current law; the House would shave that by another $12 billion.
The Senate would reduce projected spending on space exploration. The House would take its shining jewel, the space shuttle, and sell as much as possible to investors.
The House proposal would reduce projected Medicaid spending by $184 billion through 2002, about $9 billion more than the Senate plan. On the other hand the House proposed increasing military spending more than $90 billion over current projections to $1.9 trillion over seven years.
All those are but recommendations; the actual shape of changes is up to appropriations committees that will have to tailor programs to meet the spending levels that the Budget Committee has proposed. But House Republicans indicated that many of the proposals have been cleared with their appropriations panel, and some -- like a proposal to return welfare to the states -- have already passed the House.
The House proposal would kill 13 Federal agencies. The Economic Development Administration, which dispenses grants to state and local governments seeking to attract new business, would go; so would the Federal Maritime Commission, the main Federal patron to the nation's shrunken domestic shipping and shipbuilding industries. The Legal Services Corporation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Federal Transit Administration, and the Travel and Tourism Administration would all bite the dust or, in the case of public television, lose their funding in stages.
The House proposes to eliminate 284 Federal programs, from the Education department's Goals 2000 initiative to an outreach program to socially disadvantaged farmers to the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities. The Points of Light Foundation would lose its Federal aid; so would the volunteer Americorps program.
Representative Kasich said, "I've had Cabinet secretaries come to my office and tell me, 'There's one good thing about your coming to power: now we can get some reform.' "
Turning to his Democratic colleagues he said, "You only had 40 years to do this. You only had 40 years."
But the House budget also leans heavily in its deficit arithmetic on a series of economic assumptions that the more conservative Senate committee shunned as too speculative. Fully $170 billion of the savings in the House plan rest on an assumption that balancing the budget will lower interest rates and reduce Federal borrowing costs.

HEADLINE: Republican Budget Extremes

 BODY:
Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, proposes to cut nearly one out of every three dollars that the Government spends on domestic programs. He proposes to slash tax credits for poor workers and subsidies for the arts and humanities. He proposes to eliminate the Commerce Department and scores of Federal programs. The Domenici plan would cut Medicare by 15 percent and Medicaid by about 30 percent.
Alarming? Outrageous? The frightening fact is that by current Washington standards, Mr. Domenici is the voice of budget moderation. His House counterpart, John Kasich, issued a seven-year plan yesterday that, by cutting taxes by $350 billion and raising defense by $70 billion, is more than $400 billion harsher on non-defense programs. 
 Mr. Kasich would gut the Legal Services Corporation -- which provides legal assistance to poor people, the Voice of America, and hundreds of other agencies and programs as well as massive cuts, beyond what Mr. Domenici proposes, in food stamps and other welfare programs.
Mr. Domenici deserves praise for holding the line against cutting taxes or boosting defense. But his budget would still victimize vulnerable families by, for example, stripping a $20 billion tax credit from some low-paid workers. Apparently tax hikes are dandy as long as they are aimed only at the needy.
The G.O.P. has vowed to eliminate the deficit by 2002 -- a politically seductive, but economically damaging timetable -- without raising taxes or nicking Social Security and defense. That requires slashing everything that is left over -- not only programs for the needy but also public investments in infrastructure and scientific research on which the long-term health of the economy partially depends. The "moderate" Mr. Domenici has proposed bad public policy.
The Republican drive to balance the budget is forcing irresponsibly hasty cuts in Medicare. The Medicare program is threatening to run a deficit of $100 billion or more each year by around 2005. It must be reduced, and the elderly should absorb much of the cut since they now enjoy huge subsidies that are unrelated to their need. Mr. Domenici and Mr. Kasich propose large cuts -- about a third of their deficit-reduction plans -- but leave unsettled who among doctors, hospitals and the elderly would cough up the savings. Once voters are told, the severe impact of the G.O.P. budget will finally emerge.
The mishandling of Medicare comes in counting on savings before figuring out what reform best protects the integrity of the program. Few experts believe Washington can save $250 billion or more without imposing excessive premiums and deductibles. The responsible way to go about saving money on Medicare is to open up the system to competition. That requires giving the elderly a choice of keeping the current fee-for-service coverage or else choosing a private plan that would offer lower premiums, better benefits, or both. Done properly -- which will require reform of the private insurance market also -- competition can eventually control costs and improve quality. But competition cannot work magic by 2002.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich says that the Medicare cuts are designed solely to save Medicare, not balance the budget. That pledge lacks candor. No one with a mind on health care would decide to whack 15 percent off the cost of a program in an impossibly short time before knowing what reform would work best.
The G.O.P. has fulfilled its campaign promise to propose a smaller Federal Government. The proposed budgets would beneficially eliminate wasteful bureaucracies and ill-deserved corporate handouts, such as subsidies for agriculture and export promotion.
But the G.O.P., which has now issued the outlines of its budget, has yet to tell voters who will win, who will lose and by how much. When that conversation takes place, the Republicans ought to loosen their supposedly ironclad promises. They should either raise taxes a bit to soften the spending cuts, or else let the seven-year timetable slip.

Commercial Rent Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Cutting the Rent Tax Generates Votes, Not Jobs" (letter, May 5): Stephen Kagann's criticism of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposal to reduce the commercial rent tax is not based on the facts and distorts the Mayor's economic agenda. 
 Mr. Kagann would have you believe that elimination of the commercial rent tax north of 96th Street in Manhattan and in the other boroughs is the only element in the Mayor's commercial rent tax reduction program. Not so. The executive budget also includes a 25 percent cut in the commercial rent tax in Manhattan's central business districts and in other areas south of 96th Street.
This would effectively bring down the commercial rent tax rate in midtown and downtown Manhattan from 6 percent to 4.5 percent. This proposal represents the first across-the-board commercial rent tax reduction in Manhattan since 1981, benefiting all of the city's major employers.
The Mayor is interested in making the entire city more competitive, thereby stimulating the creation of new private-sector jobs for our residents.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Solving the Problems Of Public Education

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Although "Reading, Writing and Rukeyser" begins with a look at a Baltimore school that has successes along with failures, tomorrow night's hourlong program is less a report than, in Louis Rukeyser's favorite image, an alarm bell. It is a chorus of interviews about what is wrong with the public schools and, sketchily, what should be done about it.
 Jeff Howard, the head of an organization called Efficacy Inc., which Mr. Rukeyser does not trouble to describe, paints a dire picture of an America divided between an educated minority and an uneducated, jobless, bothersome majority. Benno Schmidt Jr., the former president of Yale University, promises that his Edison Project's partnership with some public schools will revolutionize education for the better (a laptop in every lap!), but so far we have only his word for it. 
The hour has a conservative spin, appropriate to a venture paid for by investment companies and fronted by a man whose coiffure is the envy of Wall Street. The strongest voices are those of Milton Friedman, the free-market economist, and Lynne Cheney, the former head of the National Endowment for the Humanities, both of whom want Washington out of the schools.
 Opposed to that are Richard Riley, the Secretary of Education, whose department and job are at risk, and Albert Shanker, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, who offers an argument against school vouchers and other sorts of privatization that goes unanswered in this hour. He says that in any competitive system, private schools are likely to attract the cream of the student crop, leaving the hard cases to the public schools. Mr. Rukeyser, who repeatedly takes time to prompt his guests to criticize political correctness (nobody has a good word to say for it), does not find an opportunity to ask the champions of privatization about Mr. Shanker's concern.
 Higher standards and longer school days and years are urged from all sides. Left unexplored is what is to be done with disruptive or just plain stupid students, whom everyone agrees should not be permitted to keep teachers from teaching and other children from learning. Orphanages? Reform schools? Work houses? Mr. Rukeyser's resounding calls for change leave the problem children out of it, like the Baltimore truant last seen on the program sitting on a stoop, looking as bleak as his future.
 Alarm bells are in order, and it is unreasonable to expect a television program to tell how to overhaul as complicated and resistant an institution as public education. But the ringing slogans with which Mr. Rukeyser concludes ("Kick the bums out of the classroom!"), are not particularly illuminating. A little greater investment in posing questions to which he did not already have the answers might have yielded a more impressive return.

HEADLINE: Clinton, Visiting Kiev, Celebrates Success

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, May 11

 BODY:
President Clinton came to this capital today to begin a two-day celebration of Ukraine's striking new willingness to surrender its nuclear weapons and embrace a market economy.
With frictions between the United States and Ukraine over those issues now fading, the White House was unabashed in casting Mr. Clinton's visit as a tribute to the strides taken here by President Leonid Kuchma, who won election last July. 
 Yet even as Mr. Clinton applauded Mr. Kuchma, the President's aides were taking much of the credit today for prodding Ukraine toward better behavior. Mr. Kuchma has hurried the process of nuclear disarmament and pushed economic reforms in the former Soviet republic, a country the size of France that still holds world's third-largest number of nuclear weapons.
Mr. Clinton's top deputies were also moving aggressively to defend the summit meeting that the President just concluded in Moscow with President Boris N. Yeltsin from attacks by Congressional Republicans, underscoring the political dimension of Mr. Clinton's trip even 18 months before the next Presidential election.
While the Administration urged restraint upon critics it accused of making foreign policy into political fodder, its blunt response was bound to elevate the American-Russian relationship to new prominence.
At a news conference here this evening, Secretary of State Warren Christopher all but set diplomacy aside when asked about criticism from Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader and presidential candidate. On Wednesday Mr. Dole criticized the summit meeting as having been "more successful in ceremony and atmospherics than in substantive results."
Mr. Christopher said: "It seems to me to be a relic of the cold war to think that every time the American President and the Russian President get together, their meeting has to be scored like a night baseball game with wins and losses and a box score. But if there is to be a box score, it seems to me very hard to put this in the loss column or the failure column."
Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, was even more direct. "The summit was a success," Mr. Burns said. "The people who think it was a failure don't understand what happened."
In Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Dole said he was disappointed that Mr. Clinton had been unsuccessful in halting the sale of Russian nuclear reactors to Iran and that no progress had been made in ending the war in secessionist Chechnya. Calling the talks a "failure," Mr. Dole said Congress should reassess relations with Russia.
But Mr. Clinton's deputies labeled the complaint both mistaken and inappropriate.
"It's somewhat surprising that the Senate majority leader would criticize the President of the United States while he was on foreign soil," Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, told reporters aboard Air Force One. "There used to be a tradition that members of Congress did not offer that type of criticism while the President was traveling abroad, but I guess like so many things these days, those traditions of amicability are thrown out the window when politics roll around."
Before Mr. Clinton flew here from Moscow this morning, he met with a cross-section of Russian political leaders and visited a Coca-Cola plant. He also joined Mr. Christopher and his national security adviser, Anthony Lake, in a meeting with the brother and son of Federick Cuny, the 50-year-old American relief worker who is missing in Chechnya.
Mr. Lake said that Mr. Clinton had told the Cunys that the Administration was determined to keep working to find Mr. Cuny, who was at work on a project for the Soros Foundation when he disappeared last month.
At a White House briefing in Kiev this evening, Mr. Lake expressed regret at signs that the fighting in Chechnya was increasing despite the cease-fire.
"I think that you would see the same pattern continuing," Mr. Lake said, speaking before reports emerged of intensive new shelling. "In our view, and as the President said very firmly in his televised address to the Russian people, we continue to see this as a tragedy, and we hope that there can be an indefinite extension of the cease-fire."
Mr. Lake went on to say that the continued fighting was "damaging reform within Russia and damaging Russia's relations with other nations."
The White House had said it expected that Mr. Clinton's talks here with Mr. Kuchma would not be marked by any of the strains in his meeting with Mr. Yeltsin, and all indications tonight were of American-Ukrainian conviviality.
Mr. Clinton and his aides have found much to cheer over the last year, as Ukraine ratified accords pledging a commitment to nuclear disarmament and Mr. Kuchma, who succeeded Leonid M. Kravchuk, rushed through changes that have opened the economy to market forces and encouraged foreign investment.
Today, as Mr. Kuchma greeted him outside Mariinsky Palace, the 18th-century Baroque structure now used by the Ukrainian President, Mr. Clinton was warm in his praise.
"Last year we had a very good year as Ukraine became a nonnuclear state and made dramatic economic reforms," Mr. Clinton said. "This nation is large, strong, committed to independence, committed to having cordial relations with all of its neighbors and with others who share its values. And I believe its strategic importance is very, very great."
The two leaders met privately for 90 minutes, and were joined later by their top aides for more talks.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Rise as Retail Sales Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
In what may prove remarkably good timing, a long-expected rise in inflation seems to be emerging just as the economy has decelerated enough to keep the increase in prices from climbing much further, Government figures suggested today.
The nation's producers managed to raise prices for finished goods by five-tenths of 1 percent in April, the biggest increase since November, while products at earlier stages of production resumed their pattern of hefty increases after a March pause, the Labor Department reported. 
 "You're getting signs that prices in the pipeline are starting to work their way up" toward the consumer, said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "There's some challenge here to the rosy outlook."
At the same time, however, the Commerce Department's preliminary report on retail sales showed a drop of four-tenths of 1 percent in April as consumers spent markedly less for motor vehicles, furniture and other big-ticket items.
This tended to minimize nervousness about the price data since the consumer, whose retail spending alone accounts for one-third of economic activity, has become markedly more cautious this year.
One reason for the April decline in retail sales, according to Rosanne M. Cahn, chief equity research economist at CS First Boston, was "surging" final income-tax payments, which she estimated to have been $13.5 billion higher, netted against refunds, than in April 1994.
A third set of figures today showed that first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell 6,000, to 365,000, in the week ended last Saturday. The more reliable four-week moving average, however, climbed 5,250, to 357,000, the highest point since June.
While a few analysts have begun to call for a relaxation of monetary policy lest the economy skid into recession, most continue to believe the Federal Reserve will do nothing at its next scheduled policy meeting May 23. Among other factors, today's retail sales report was not as weak as it appeared since the Government revised upward the totals for both February and March.
Nor were the price figures so worrisome as to prompt the Fed to raise short-term interest rates again.
"Though disappointing, the April Producer Price Index advance will have no impact on Fed policy," Joseph Liro of S. G. Warburg advised clients. "The Fed has stated that it will tolerate some price pressure as long as the economy shows evidence of slowing to its long-run potential."
Brian M. Jones, economist at Salomon Brothers, concurred. "The thing you've got to focus on is growth," he said.
Still, the pressures were not confined to energy, which jumped 2.3 percent. The so-called core rate that excludes both food and energy rose three-tenths of 1 percent, which, except for a similar rise in February, was the largest since last May.
And producer indexes for goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production surged seven-tenths of 1 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively. This was the biggest jump for raw materials since October 1993.
Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers.
The price of 36 finished items advanced by at least two-tenths of 1 percent, more than twice as many as declined, Mr. Liro found.
Some of the biggest changes were in food, which fell over all for the third time in four months, as the beef and veal category dropped 7.6 percent, the most in nearly 20 years. On the other hand, floods in California helped send the price of vegetables soaring 17.8 percent after a 5.7 percent rise in March. In intermediate goods, prices of nondurable factory materials, such as chemicals, accelerated 2.5 percent, quadruple the March increase. Durable factory items, such as metals, edged up two-tenths of 1 percent as increases for cement, silver, platinum and zinc more than offset declines for copper, aluminum, copper and brass mill shapes, plywood, hardwood lumber and building paper and board.
Among crude goods, the widely followed category of basic industrial materials climbed 1.2 percent, compared with five-tenths of 1 percent in March.
The Commerce Department report showed retail sales at $192.58 billion for the month, with a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent for nondurables, not enough to overcome a 1.5 percent drop for durables, goods designed to last at least three years. Excluding the automotive group, where dealers saw a 2 percent drop, total sales would have edged up one-tenth of 1 percent.
Merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes suffered a 2.4 percent decline while those selling furniture and other equipment for the home had 1.3 percent less revenue than in March.
The figures are adjusted for recurring seasonal variation, for holidays and for differences in the number of trading days. No adjustment is made for changes in price.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise, With Help From Dollar Gains

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market, seemingly unmoved by a hint of inflation, rose to new highs yesterday, as the dollar improved.
"There was substantial institutional participation today," said William Rothe, managing director for Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore. "The participation was based on continued confidence in a) a soft economic landing, and b) moderate economic expansion" that benefits stocks. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.57 points to close at 4,411.19, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.01 point, to 524.37, barely ahead of the record set the day before. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 6.21 points, to 853.83, also a record.
And the bond market, which fell sharply in the morning, recovered in the afternoon, also helping stocks. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended unchanged at 7 percent.
While stocks over all rose slightly, it was surprising that they rose at all. The Producer Price Index, a closely watched measure of inflation, indicated to some a renewal of inflationary pressure. Inflation, or the fear of inflation, hurts the prices of stocks and bonds.
The April index rose five-tenths of 1 percent, compared with Wall Street expectations of four-tenths of 1 percent. The so-called core rate, excluding fluctuating food and energy costs, rose three-tenths of 1 percent, compared with an expected two-tenths of 1 percent.
"But there are so many cross-currents going on today," said Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc., an investment advisory firm. She noted that April retail sales fell by a larger-than-expected four-tenths of 1 percent and that the Federal Reserve's beige book survey of regional business activity on Wednesday indicated a slowing economy.
What is more, she noted, the dollar demonstrated its biggest one-day gain in nearly four years against the Japanese yen and the German mark. Big institutional investors and traders, especially in Europe, "are now calling a bottom" to the dollar's slide in value, she said. "With the dollar reaching bottom, some foreign money is returning" to American financial markets, she said.
The sharp drop in the dollar has discouraged foreign investors from buying dollar-denominated assets because American profits can be reduced or wiped out when exchanged for strong currencies like the mark. The Dow, for example, has increased 15.04 percent in dollars so far this year, and fallen 1.06 percent in Japanese yen.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 341.4 million shares changing hands, about 2 percent above this year's daily average of 334 million shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.05 point, to 282.46, with advancing stocks thinly outnumbering declining stocks, 1,144 to 1,118. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.44 points, to 486.32.
Among advancing stocks was CBT Group, a developer of computer software based in Ireland, whose American depository receipts rose $6, to 35 3/4, in Nasdaq trading. Each A.D.R. represents one share of CBT stock. The company has a development agreement with Microsoft for educational software.
Kellogg rose 3 1/2, to 66 1/8, after a Goldman, Sachs analyst raised her assessment of the stock.
Among declining stocks was the Hilton Hotels Company, which fell 6 1/2, to 71 1/4. Some investors were disappointed that Hilton chose to spin off its casino operations rather than sell the entire company. And some Japanese companies continued to fall in price as trade relations between the United States and Japan grew increasingly hostile. The A.D.R.'s of Canon Inc., each representing five shares, fell 5 1/8, to 73 7/8. The A.D.R.'s of Hitachi Ltd. dropped 2 3/4, to 98 1/4. A Hitachi A.D.R. represents 10 shares.
Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrials, 13 rose, led by United Technologies, up 1 7/8, to 76 3/8. Of the stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 214 rose -- led by Wal-Mart Stores, up 7/8, to 24 3/8.
The most active Nasdaq stock, with 9.2 million shares traded, was MCI Communications. It rose 3/16 , to 20 3/4.

HEADLINE: Clinton Meets With Opponents of Yeltsin

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 11

 BODY:
In an effort to suggest that his Russia policy is not entirely focused on the politically battered Boris N. Yeltsin, President Clinton ended his two-day summit meeting in Moscow today by having breakfast with 10 leaders of the President's opposition.
At the American Ambassador's residence, Mr. Clinton met with alienated onetime supporters of Mr. Yeltsin like Yegor T. Gaidar, a former Deputy Prime Minister who drafted Russia's economic reform program. He also heard the views of longtime foes like Gennadi A. Zyuganov, head of the Communist Party. 
 But the ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who leads the largest opposition faction in the lower house of Parliament, was not included. The White House considers Mr. Zhirinovsky, a fiery and unpredictable politician given to making anti-Semitic remarks, outside the political mainstream.
Mr. Clinton gave a brief presentation, explaining the American two-party system, as well as the role of third-party candidates in his election. But he said he was mainly interested in discussing conditions in Russia. "I am here to listen and learn," he said.
All of his guests complained about the Yeltsin administration. Grigory A. Yavlinsky, leader of the democratic Yabloko faction and a future presidential candidate, said he had warned Mr. Clinton of the "growing authoritarianism" of the Government.
Mr. Gaidar, who leads the Russia's Choice faction, spoke of the rising tide of nationalism in Russia that was causing many Russians to mistrust the West and feel nostalgia for the cold war, when their country was a superpower.
Mr. Zyuganov described people's despair over rising crime, raising the specter that Russia could soon turn into "a big Colombia." He said the Communist Party prescribed "free and democratic elections."
The conversation did not dwell on issues that preoccupied the summit meeting, like the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran or the expansion of NATO, and instead focused on the burning domestic issues of the war in Chechnya, the next presidential elections and economic reform.
According to their political rivals around the table, the representatives of the Communists and the conservative Agrarian Party surprised them by expressing loyalty to economic and democratic reforms in Russia. "Had they spoken like this in the Duma and at public rallies," Mr. Gaidar commented drily, referring to the lower house of Parliament, "I would withdraw from politics."

Dollar Surges On New Plan To Cut Deficit

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
The dollar staged its biggest one-day rally in nearly four years, rebounding against the German mark and the Japanese yen on speculation that Washington might do more than in the past to cut the Federal budget deficit.
The dollar was also helped, analysts said, by a new mood among traders that the dollar had plunged too far too fast since the beginning of the year. There was also increasing hope that President Clinton's threat to impose sanctions on Japanese imports meant that the Administration was less likely to resort to trying to drive down the value of the dollar to help narrow the trade gap with Japan. 
 The surge in the dollar followed within hours of the House Budget Committee's vote early yesterday morning to cut spending sharply in a Republican plan to balance the budget within seven years.
The dollar ended the day of trading in New York yesterday at 1.4335 German marks, up 3.2 percent from 1.3888 marks on Wednesday. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose by 2.2 percent, to 85.68 yen versus 83.80 the previous day.
Meanwhile, further signs of a slowdown in the economy helped overcome any fears of higher inflation that might have been generated by a report yesterday that producer prices rose at a rate slightly greater than expected. [Page D2.] Stocks rose slightly, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 6.57, to 4,411.19. [Page D6.]
Despite the sharp increase yesterday, the dollar remains well below its level of just a few weeks ago against the world's other two big currencies.
"The market had become overly pessimistic about the dollar," said W. Wayne Grigull, director of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch & Company. "The good news catalyst" that set off the rally, he added, was "people getting optimistic on prospects for cutting the budget deficit," and the sense that President Clinton was showing stronger leadership in his showdown with Japan over trade in automobiles.
The recent steep decline in the dollar has been caused by concern about the nation's budget deficit, about fears of higher inflation and by worries that the Federal Reserve was not prepared to increase interest rates simply to support the currency.
Looking forward, the dollar's prospects now appear to depend increasingly on perceptions among traders over whether Washington will follow through on vows by those in Congress to cut the budget deficit, analysts said. "One factor that's influencing the dollar is the budget plans released by the House and Senate," said Michael J. Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America, the New York office of the Japanese brokerage firm. "That would be an enormously positive thing for the dollar." A big decline in the Federal budget deficit could help the dollar by reducing the Government's need to borrow from foreign and domestic investors, making more funds available for private investment that would help growth.
Congress's new resolve to cut the budget deficit seems to have caught some by surprise. "I personally was astounded by the House budget," said David Buchen, managing director of Citicorp's North American foreign exchange business.
Nonetheless, there is still a strong tide in the market against the dollar, which remains near its weakest levels in decades. "Deep in my heart, I don't think the dollar is going to become a strong currency with this President," Mr. Buchen said. Indeed, he added, many investors remain wary of the White House, fearing that it is much more concerned about resisting large spending cuts than in defending the currency.
One reason the dollar turned so sharply, analysts said, is because of increasing fears that the German mark is likely to weaken against other European currencies. Mr. Buchen cited recent reports in which, he said, "two members of the Bundesbank poor-mouthed" the German economy, suggesting that German interest rates would continue to fall.
With the dollar's gains, the markets also seemed to be responding to recent Federal Reserve policy. The Fed raised interest rates seven times from February 1994 to February 1995, contributing to a slowdown in the American economy that is helping to dampen fears of future inflation. Susan Phillips, a Fed governor, told reporters in Chicago yesterday that there was now "a good chance" that the economy was slowing to a sustainable pace. New York traders said her remarks helped buoy the dollar.
Slower growth has strengthened the arguments of those who believe that the economy can achieve a so-called soft landing in which it avoids a recession that would cause interest rates to fall sharply, making the United States a less attractive place to hold money.
The Business Council, a group of 100 business leaders meeting in Williamsburg, Va., forecast yesterday that the economy would slow without a recession. It predicted that modest economic growth would continue through 1996. A poll of the group showed that it expected the economy, adjusted for inflation, to expand at an annual rate of about 2.3 percent through the end of 1996. The group also forecast that inflation would remain relatively moderate at 3.2 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 1996.

HEADLINE: The Deficit Debate

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Last summer, the Clinton White House credited the nation's economic expansion to its own deficit reduction efforts. Those same officials have spent the last two days attacking Republicans for risking serious harm with their plans to balance the budget through big cuts in spending.
Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said at a briefing last summer, "The fight we had on the economy was essentially a fight in which we were the party that led the charge to reduce the deficit and get the economy going." 
 But today, Mr. Panetta and other senior White House officials warned at another briefing of the dangers of trying to balance the budget by the year 2002, contending that it would limit the Government's flexibility in responding to any recession over the next seven years.
Economists from a variety of political positions expressed a great deal of skepticism today about these warnings. For starters, they said, it is unclear that the Republican budget resolutions announced this week would prove more enduring than legislation in 1985 that required a balanced budget by 1991.
"My guess is if were to adopt a plan such as the resolutions approach, the American people will ask halfway down that path for a correction," said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
The Republican cuts may bring real hardships to millions of Americans who may lose Government jobs and benefits or pay more for services like Medicare. Yet, many economists believe that even if the Republicans succeed in enforcing the kinds of cuts they have in mind, the cuts by themselves will not slow overall economic growth significantly.
A trillion-dollar cut in spending seems like a lot, they note, until it is compared to the total output of the economy projected for that seven-year period: $54 trillion.
Even more important than spending to the pace of economic growth, at least in the short term, is the size of the deficit. But the Republican plans announced this week would cut the Federal budget deficit each year by an amount equal to less than eight weeks of growth in the nation's economy, even at the current subdued rate of economic growth. That strikes many economists as a fairly gradual pace of budget deficit cuts.
"If you're worried about avoiding a recession, maintaining economic stability and high employment, it doesn't make a heck of a lot of difference," said Charles L. Schultze, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Jimmy Carter. "People who fight deficit reduction on the grounds that it's harmful to the economy are just wrong."
There is clearly a political as well as an economic component to the Clinton Administration's argument. For one thing, it provides justification for standing up for preserving spending that is popular with important constituent groups, as when President Clinton vowed in Iowa last month to defend farm subsidies. And if the economy sours during next year's election campaign, the attacks that the Administration is making now could prove useful in assigning blame.
There is only slightly more sympathy among economists to the Administration's fears about what might happen if the economy, after three years of strong growth, slips into a recession.
Alice M. Rivlin, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, warned in an interview this afternoon that the Republicans might worsen a future recession by locking the country into achieving a balanced budget by 2002.
Since the Depression, policy makers have blunted the effects of downturns in the business cycle by stimulating the economy with extra spending. The Republican goal of balancing the budget "increases the risk, and particularly it increases the risk when you're at a point in the cycle when you've been growing quite a long time," she said.
But even if the Republican Congress passes a seven-year deficit reduction plan this year, a future Congress could pass new legislation to replace it if the economy did run into a severe recession.
If Congress approves the current Republican budget they would be similar in their legal basis to the 1985 Gramm-Rudman legislation, which called for a balanced budget by 1991.
The budget targets were met for two years, but then a new Congress took office in 1987 and, even without a recession, found it too difficult to make the necessary spending cuts to continue meeting the targets. The balanced budget goal was extended, and later abandoned entirely.
Ms. Rivlin said that she nonetheless believed the current Republican plan might prove durable and lock in budget policy making. "It's a piece of legislation, but it's a piece of legislation that needs to be taken seriously, and we take the Republicans seriously," she said.
Mr. Schultze said that if budget cuts did slow economic growth unexpectedly, the Federal Reserve Board could compensate by reducing short-term interest rates to stimulate the economy. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, strongly hinted that he would do so during Congressional testimony on Feb. 23.
But Laura D. Tyson, the head of the National Economic Council, warned on Wednesday against handcuffing budget policy and relying solely on interest-rate policy to guide the economy.
A more difficult question is whether the composition of spending cuts makes a difference. Ms. Rivlin said that if Congress cuts Government investment programs to reduce the deficit and Government borrowing, there would be a risk that the private sector would not invest the savings as efficiently. Most conservative economists disagree.

HEADLINE: Budget Cuts Provoke Interest Groups' Fury

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
The dramatic spending reductions put forward this week by House and Senate Republicans have stirred up a hornet's nest among interest groups in Washington.
"I think there is no way to look at the current budget proposals and not see them as a drastic hit on environmental programs," said Gawain Kripke, director of the Friends of the Earth Appropriations Project. He was speaking of proposals to reduce financing for research on renewable energy sources and to open the Arctic Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas drilling. 
 "These cuts are so big that for a number of our hospitals, a substantial number, it's going to be very disruptive," Dick Davidson, president of the American Hospital Association said of the proposals to hold down projected increases in the Medicare and Medicaid health programs for the elderly, the disabled and the poor. "Ultimately it will affect quality, and a number of them are going to have to close."
While interest groups representing veterans, the elderly, farmers, mayors, children and the poor castigated the Republicans' proposals, the budget plans received high marks from business lobbyists who believe they will lead to lower interest rates, and from the conservative Christian Coalition, which supports the House's $500-per child tax credit.
"We love the overall thrust of the proposals," said Lonnie Taylor, vice president for Congressional Affairs for the United States Chamber of Commerce. "The chamber has been advocating a balanced budget for years. To have two proposals that are likely to make it to the floor of Congress is just wonderful."
Veteran lobbyists in Washington say there has not been so much concern, praise or protest over a budget proposal since 1981, when President Ronald Reagan and David A. Stockman, then director of the Office of Management and the Budget, sought significant spending reductions and hefty tax cuts.
But the proposals unveiled this week by House and Senate Republicans to pare in the range of $1 trillion from projected Federal spending increases over seven years, dwarf the budget cuts put forward by Mr. Reagan and Mr. Stockman.
"The last time there was this same sense of threat was during the Stockman, O.M.B. years, particularly the early 80's," said a lobbyist who asked that neither he nor his organization be identified. "At that point, those cuts were considered dramatic, if not worse, because we had not experienced anything like them before. But these are much larger."
As they begin to digest the scope of the Republicans' spending plans, representatives of some interest groups say that proposed reductions will play havoc with city budgets by reducing the Community Development Block Grant, will increase economic pressure on farmers by slashing farm price supports by $8 billion to $9 billion, will punish poor working families by reducing the earned income tax credit and will break a longstanding promise to the elderly not to mess with Social Security.
"At the end of this process we're going to learn just how much the public hates the Federal Government," said Thomas Mann, an analyst of government at the Brookings Institution, a research center here. "The Republicans have taken the public at their word that they want a smaller government."
Indeed, the National Taxpayers' Union said the wailing by many groups was in marked contrast to statements these organizations had previously made stating that they favored balancing the budget so long as the pain was spread around equitably.
Pete Sepp, a spokesman for the taxpayers' union, said, "These are the very same groups, when lobbying against the balanced budget amendments, that said, 'We know there have to be cuts in spending and we know we have to balance the budget, but this amendment is not the way to do it.' Now it's time for them to put up or shut up. If they can't come up with a better package, then they shouldn't complain."
Many critics of the Republicans' proposals insist that they support deficit reduction, and some even like some of the Republican cuts -- in other people's programs. "When we don't see cuts in other services such as Social Security, that has us greatly concerned," said Bill Smith, director of Public Affairs for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who objected to reductions in funds for construction of Veterans hospitals.
When it comes to programs they favor, however, these critics tend to say the reductions go too far, or break longstanding promises.
Martin A. Corry, director of Federal Affairs at the American Association of Retired Persons, said his group was surprised to find that the House Republicans had recommended a change in inflation calculations that would effectively reduce Social Security and other Government benefits starting in 1999.
Under the House Republicans' plan, announced on Wednesday by Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the Budget Committee, the Consumer Price Index would be adjusted downward by six-tenths of 1 percent in 1999, on ground that it overstated the extent of inflation. The move would reduce the cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security payments, which are based on the index, which was already set to be adjusted downward in 1998.
"What was surprising," Mr. Corry said, "was that after all of the statements by leadership on both sides of the aisle, including the President, that they would leave it alone, Mr. Kasich has reached to beyond what the Congressional Budget Office has projected."
Pat Wolff, chief lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau, said agricultural subsidies had already been reduced by 50 percent from the projected spending levels since 1986. Now, she said, the Republicans were pushing for an actual reduction in price supports, rather than merely slowing their rate of growth.
"We believe that if you take a look at historic spending for agriculture, that you find that these cuts are just not equitable," she said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Are Lower Following Volatile Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were generally lower yesterday, after a volatile trading session.
The market was weighed down by a Government report on producer prices showing inflation at the high end of expectations. 
 With the dollar higher yesterday, there was also concern that foreign central banks would sell their large holdings of Treasury securities, traders and analysts said. More than a dozen central banks sold German marks, Japanese yen and other currencies for dollars in early March as part of a coordinated international effort to support the dollar and have since parked that money in Treasury securities. The recent rally in the Treasury market has realized profits for these banks, so some may have sold, traders speculated.
The price of the 30-year bond edged up 1/32 , to 10727/32 , leaving its yield unchanged at 7 percent. Rates on shorter-maturity bills rates were up 2 basis points on average. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In addition, the Treasury sold $17 billion of 38-day cash management bills at an average rate at auction of 5.81 percent, with dealers saying demand was strong. Cash management bills are used to meet the Treasury's short-term borrowing needs beyond the money raised at the regularly scheduled auctions.
The report on producer prices helped keep inflation concerns alive in the market yesterday. The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index rose five-tenths of 1 percent in April, the biggest increase since November.
But the inflationary red flag raised by the producer prices report was tempered by a separate report on retail sales that showed an unexpected weakness.
The Commerce Department reported a preliminary estimate of retail sales that showed a drop of four-tenths of 1 percent in April. Retail sales had been expected to be flat.
"This morning's retail sales data support the view of a soft landing -- not a recession," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
She said the latest weekly number of Americans filing unemployment claims for the first time continued to show a soft labor market. Initial jobless claims for the week ending May 6 showed a decline to 365,000, compared with 371,00 in the previous week.
"These data confirm very well to the impression that Fed policy will remain steady for a protracted period," Ms. Schaja said.
Some analysts say the market may be pausing to consolidate the strong gains of the last week. They do not think there is anything around near term that is likely to undermine Treasury securities.
George Mateyo, chief executive of Carnegie Capital Managment Company in Cleveland, said the recent economic news would make buying bonds safe at least for the next eight weeks.
But Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Money Watch in New York, a market analysis and research firm, said, "Today's numbers fit well with the view that the market has overreacted to recent numbers, and that the extent of the slowdown is not as great as many have perceived."
"I believe that we are in fact at the low point of this slowdown, meaning that I think several factors will converge together to boost growth into the summer," he said. "These factors include a better housing market, in response to lower mortgage rates, better export growth, thanks to a lower dollar and the end of the inventory correction and a pickup in consumer spending, helped in part by the booming stock market."
Mr. Palash expects the Fed will maintain its monetary policy until August or September, "and than we'll see."

HEADLINE: House Action Dooms Plan For a Bridge to Ellis Island

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

 BODY:
Money for a bridge linking Ellis Island to New Jersey was removed from a Congressional spending bill yesterday, handing New York a victory in the two-year tussle between the states over the project.
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey had pushed for the $15 million bridge to improve access to the island and to lure tourists to New Jersey. 
 But the 1,400-foot bridge was opposed by New York and several historic preservation and environmental groups as an attempt at economic piracy that would mar a national landmark. New York gets over $1 million a year from the island in fees alone, while New Jersey gets about $150,000, according to park service officials.
Senator Lautenberg had reserved the money in last year's budget for the bridge, pending an environmental study, and an attempt by New York to kill it then failed. But this year New York prevailed in its attempt to shunt the money elsewhere in the National Park system.
"Today we slammed the door shut on New Jersey's attempt to steal Ellis Island," Representative Nita M. Lowey said in a statement. "Chalk one up for New York."
Although the House and the Senate are still haggling over the spending package, a formal vote is expected within the next two weeks. The bridge's defeat in conference after lobbying by both Democrats and Republicans from New York doomed the plan.
"That's the end of the road," said Bill M. Wise, the spokesman for Senator Lautenberg. The Senator, who had portrayed the bridge as an asset for all Americans rather than a struggle between the two states, issued a statement expressing disappointment at the rejection.
"The bridge to Ellis Island would have been a one-time investment in providing access to one of our nation's most important historic sites," the Senator said. "Now, tourists and the site itself will suffer."
He complained that the Statue of Liberty Ferry, a private New York company, would continue to hold a monopoly with its $7 fare for adults to the island. Ferry company owners could not be reached for comment.
Preservationists from both New York and New Jersey had fought the bridge, saying tourists should approach the island by boat to relive the arrival of their immigrant ancestors. Four in 10 Americans can trace their ancestry to the 12 million immigrants who arrived via Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954.
"From a preservationist point of view, the experience of Ellis Island is such that it must be approached by boat," said Bernadette Castro, Parks Commissioner for New York State. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Conservation had also questioned the need for a bridge, concerned that the extra traffic it generated would erode the quality of Liberty State Park, newly emerging from the decaying freightyards that existed along the shore for years.
A study recently conducted by the National Park Service estimated that Ellis Island, already one of the biggest draws in the country with over a million tourists annually, would get an additional 115,000 visitors if the bridge were built. Officials said that now that the bridge had been defeated, an attempt should be made to make the ferry ride free occasionally, or at least cheaper, as suggested in the study.
This fall the park service was planning to conduct public hearings on ways to improve access to Ellis Island, including the bridge, a tunnel and subsidized ferry rides. It was not clear whether those hearings would be held after the deletion of the money for the bridge.
New Yorkers also accused New Jersey of seeking to build the bridge to strengthen their lawsuit claiming the island, which lies off Jersey City. The United States Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in that case this fall.
An existing bridge, for construction vehicles, connects the island to the shore, left over from the preservation work in the 1980's, but its permits are due to expire this year. Its open structure was deemed unsuitable for pedestrian traffic, butpreservationists said a sturdier bridge would not only waste taxpayer money but would also lead to tour buses.
The island, built mostly with landfill from the excavation of the New York subways at the turn of the century, still has 30 buildings that have not been restored. Proposals to use them as a combination convention center and hotel have all collapsed, but a bridge would probably be needed for any rehabilitation work.
"To keep the bridge up to be used for construction, I think it would need some additional structural work," Ann Belkov, superintendent of the park, said.
Ms. Castro said permits for the current bridge could be extended on a year-to-year basis, depending on construction plans for the island.
Citizens Against Government Waste, in a 1995 compilation of unnecessary government spending, had listed the proposed new bridge as an "Oinker," pork barrel spending.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Business as Usual in Kiev: By Taunt and Bribe

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine

 BODY:
When the Kiev city government began building a six-lane highway through the parking lot of a modern, Western-managed office complex last month, the South African Ambassador to Ukraine, whose embassy is in the building complex, blocked the city's bulldozers with his Mercedes-Benz.
The Ambassador, Deon van Schoor, said he was protesting the construction on principle -- city officials had ignored diplomatic agreements about embassies' rights to a security zone and, worse, had not bothered to give the building's tenants advance warning. 
 But he, like other Westerners working in Kiev, also saw the highway intrusion as business as usual; it was the city's way of taunting Maculan, the Austrian real estate development company that manages the building complex. Maculan's negotiations with the city to develop a larger property across the street have bogged down.
For the small cluster of foreign business people in Kiev, the episode is a stark illustration of the pitfalls in trying to start big investment projects in the former Soviet republic, where government corruption is rampant and where doing business means cutting through a Byzantine maze.
Even President Clinton's state visit to Ukraine today and tomorrow underscored the problems that have kept foreign investment at bay. As preparations were under way for the visit, one partly aimed at increasing the flow of investment capital here, Ukrainian officials publicly fretted that they were not sure Mr. Clinton could find proper space to spend the night. There are no Western-style hotel rooms to house the President and his entourage.
Referring to the war-ravaged capital of Georgia, Ambassador van Schoor said, "If they can build a four-star hotel with sauna and swimming pool and modern phones in Tbilisi, of all places, then what's wrong with Kiev?" He spoke of a Marco Polo luxury hotel recently opened there.
In Ukraine, though, the economy has been in a free fall since the republic declared its independence from the collapsing Soviet Union in 1991. Under President Leonid Kuchma, elected last July, the Government has embarked on a radical economic program of budget cutting and market pricing, propped up with hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid. Annual inflation, which the Government hopes to bring down to 250 percent by the end of 1995, ran in excess of 10,000 percent in 1993.
There are promising signs. In the last year, a few new joint-venture office complexes, hard-currency shops and fancy restaurants have opened in Kiev. Theme restaurants, many of which are joint ventures, are especially popular among the small but growing number of Ukrainian nouveau riche. Marilyn Monroe impersonators, for example, sashay around the pink and black Studio restaurant; waiters dressed as generals serve steak at a restaurant called the Napoleon.
Still, the rate of foreign investment in Ukraine still lags behind other former Soviet republics. And when it comes to construction of office space or hotels, foreign residents complain of the vagaries -- and worse -- in decisions by the Kiev city government.
"There have been dozens of legitimate offers to build hotels and offices, which are badly needed," said q Western resident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "But they get blocked by the city. It seems pretty clear that the highway was built across Maculan because somebody didn't get paid off."
Paying bribes is an accepted, if undisclosed, part of business. But many company executives say that paying a bribe to a Kiev official is no guarantee of success; another can pop up demanding an even larger cut.
"One difference about doing business in Ukraine is that you never know who the real decision-maker is," said Boris Dackiw, a lawyer in the Kiev office of Baker & McKenzie. He said that Ukraine's civil laws, particularly in the previously unknown field of private property an real estate, were confused, at times contradictory and always unpredictable. "There is no confidence here that the deal you finally make won't be reversed the next day."
Three years ago, Maculan had secured a contract with the previous city government to put up Kiev's first modern hotel and business complex in an abandoned building in the old section of Kiev. Despite prolonged negotiations with the government elected last year, the project is stalled, the building remains boarded up, and Kiev has yet to see any modern hotel and business complex.
Maculan executives declined to discuss the stalemate. The Mayor of Kiev, Leonid G. Kosakivsky, said in an interview that the city had not demanded more money from Maculan. Its disagreement with Maculan, he said, was due to the company's failure to meet municipal architectural requirements.
"We are ready to sit down and negotiate with those foreign companies that want to really settle down to work, instead of being troublemakers," Mr. Kosakivsky said. "There are plenty of other firms ready to take over the site if the Maculan company can't abide by our rules."
Outsiders were mostly amused by the dispute. "I've never seen a road get built here so fast in all my time in Ukraine," said Philippe Pegorier, the commercial attache at the French Embassy, referring to the highway that sprang up next to the Maculan complex. "The Mayor's diligence was pretty impressive."
The South African Ambassador said he was proud that his well-publicized Mercedes-Benz protest had driven an embarrassed Ukrainian Government to apologize. The city was also obliged, he said, to reduce the highway from six to four lanes to leave room for a security zone in front of the building.
"It was fun," he said of his effort to stave off the city bulldozers. "But the Mayor was furious, and he still is."
Mr. Kosakivsky did not disagree. "I would like to know what the Mayor of New York City would do if some foreign ambassador tried to stop him from building a new road next to a United Nations mission," he said. "I can predict that he would act no differently than the Mayor of Kiev."

Not all is modern in Kiev business, and hotel space, even for a President, wasn't easy to find. (Agence France-Presse)

Wheat Reaches 2-Month High After Forecast of Smaller Crop

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Wheat prices rose yesterday to their highest levels in two months after the Government predicted that frost damage would cut the size of the winter wheat crop.
Another Government report, however, caused soybean prices to decline. Coffee, sugar and cocoa prices also fell, along with silver and oil. As a result, the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities dropped 0.94 point, to 230.24. 
 Analysts had expected an increase in winter wheat production this year, but the lower estimate prompted buying. Wet weather, which has severely hampered planting of spring wheat in the northern Plains, was also a factor.
Before the start of trading, the Agriculture Department reported that winter wheat production would fall 1.4 percent, to 1.64 billion bushels, below traders' expectations of 1.68 billion.
Wheat for May delivery rose 2.25 cents at the Chicago Board of Trade, settling at $3.66 3/4 a bushel, the highest since March 7.
But Rod Engle, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said that while the wheat production figure was bullish, healthy crops in Texas and Oklahoma might offset much of the freeze losses in Kansas.
As for the spring wheat crop, delays in planting in North Dakota and South Dakota may continue, with the National Weather Service predicting above-normal rainfall in the next 10 days.
Soybean prices declined after the Agriculture Department said leftover supplies this fall would total 425 million bushels, higher than analysts had expected. May soybeans lost 4.25 cents, to $5.59 1/4 a bushel.
Elsewhere, coffee, sugar and cocoa prices fell sharply as speculators bailed out of the market. July coffee sank 4.9 cents, to 169.90 cents a pound, at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York. July sugar dropped 0.38 cent, to 11.18 cents a pound, and July cocoa declined $24, to $1,276 a metric ton.
A rebounding dollar kept pressure on silver prices as it signaled that inflation could remain in check. July silver fell 7.3 cents, to $5.372 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Swings in energy prices set off a wave of sell orders, sending oil prices down sharply. June crude oil was down 34 cents, at $19.41 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. June heating oil lost 0.86 cent, to 49.09 cents a gallon, while June gasoline edged down 0.01 cent, to 63.28 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: Rockefeller Center Forced to File For Bankruptcy by Tokyo Owner

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Rockefeller Center, a symbol of wealth, commerce and power the world over, was forced yesterday to file for bankruptcy protection by the Japanese company that controls it.
The bankruptcy filing will have few, if any, tangible effects on the 12 Art Deco buildings that make up the center in midtown Manhattan, the home of bastions of American enterprise like NBC and its parent company, General Electric, the publisher Simon & Schuster and The Associated Press, as well as Radio City Music Hall. 
 But the filing is an embarrassment for the Rockefeller family, one of the world's richest and most storied, which owns a 20 percent interest in the center. Rockefeller Center, whose first building opened in 1932, was built by John D. Rockefeller Jr., the son of the founder of the family fortune. He decided to move ahead with the center when the economies of the United States and the rest of the world were at their nadir after the stock market crash of 1929.
By gaining protection under Chapter 11 of Federal bankruptcy laws, Rockefeller Center's owners are trying to win some breathing room from creditors.
But the bankruptcy filing is likely to incite a bitter legal fight over the buildings' ownership, as the Mitsubishi Estate Company, the Japanese real estate giant that bought an 80 percent stake for almost $1.4 billion from 1989 through 1991, squares off against the publicly held real estate investment trust, Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., that holds a $1.3 billion mortgage on the property.
The decision to file for bankruptcy has already led to harsh words between Mitsubishi and the Rockefeller family. For three years, the family has fought hard to keep the center out of bankruptcy. [Page D4.]
David Rockefeller, the current family patriarch, flew to Tokyo in February to negotiate a financial restructuring plan with Mitsubishi executives, but the two parties could not come to terms. "It came as a shock and a great disappointment when I heard that the Mitsubishi board in Tokyo has decided to go the bankruptcy route," Mr. Rockefeller said in an interview yesterday.
And in a statement, Richard M. Scarlata, president and chief executive of the real estate trust, described the filing as an "unconscionable attempt to take advantage of U.S. bankruptcy laws, in light of Mitsubishi Estate's significant assets."
Analysts said that the bankruptcy filing would almost certainly force the trust, which has more than 40,000 shareholders, many of whom are retirees and other individuals, to seek bankruptcy protection. The mortgage it holds is virtually its only source of income, and the partnerships will not be making payments while in bankruptcy.
But Stephanie Leggett Young, a spokeswoman for the real estate trust, said it had $50 million of collateral it could draw on to finance its operations. "We feel confident that we are solvent," she said.
The center is technically owned by the two partnerships that filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday: RCP Associates and Rockefeller Center Properties, which is a separate entity from Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., the real estate investment trust that holds the mortgage. The two partnerships, in turn, are owned by Mitsubishi Estate and the Rockefeller family.
In Tokyo early today, the president of Mitsubishi Estates, Takeshi Fukuzawa, said that despite the bankruptcy filing, his company was not now considering selling its 80 percent stake in the center.
The partnerships contend that the weak New York commercial real estate market, which had caused cash shortfalls at the center totaling $623 million as of March, made bankruptcy protection their only option.
But the real estate investment trust, Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., contended yesterday that Mitsubishi Estate has more than enough financial wherewithal to weather the slump in rents. Moreover, the trust said it intended to take ownership of the buildings itself, essentially repossessing them under the terms of the mortgage it holds.
"If Mitsubishi can't pay its bills, we want the keys," said Ms. Leggett Young of the trust.
Michael Claes, a spokesman for the partnerships, said the trust was deliberately trying to confuse issues by suggesting that Mitsubishi Estate was responsible for the partnerships' payments. "The partnerships have the very severe deficit that forced this action," he said. "Mitsubishi is not obligated to subsidize those deficits."
But by filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, the partnerships have frozen their assets -- namely Rockefeller Center -- putting them beyond the clutches of creditors like the trust. Bankruptcy protection gives the partnerships breathing room to negotiate a restructuring of the center's financial underpinnings with the creditors.
Among the partnerships' 20 largest unsecured creditors are the real estate investment trust as well as maintenance companies like the E. J. Electric Installation Company of Long Island City and tenants, including Lazard Freres & Company, that were promised improvements in their office space.
In the documents filed in court yesterday, the partnerships were careful not to assign a specific amount to their obligations to the trust.
And analysts and investors who specialize in distressed and bankrupt companies said a fight was sure to develop over how much the trust's bondholders and shareholders -- ultimately the partnerships' largest group of creditors -- are owed. That is the typical bone of contention in bankruptcy court.
Filing for bankruptcy protection has put the partnerships, and by extension, Mitsubishi Estate, into the driver's seat as the process begins. Bankruptcy laws give debtors the first opportunity to come up with a plan of reorganization. Bankruptcy judges in the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, where the partnerships' bankruptcies were filed, also have a reputation for being lenient with debtors.
Judge Prudence B. Abram will preside over the case, and she is scheduled to hold the first hearing at 3:30 P.M. today. The partnerships will seek her approval for a financing package for their use while they are in bankruptcy protection.
In addition to the power that goes to them as a normal part of the bankruptcy proceeding, the partnerships, backed by Mitsubishi's financial muscle, will have even greater sway than the average debtor, some analysts contend. "Mitsubishi is going to wear the pants in this one," said one analyst who has followed the situation for two years and whose firm owned shares of the trust that it eventually sold.
He and others suggested that the partnerships would try to disenfranchise the trust's management and negotiate directly with debt holders, mainly Japanese and European banks and Goldman, Sachs & Company, which own the trust's $775 million of debt. Mitsubishi could, for example, propose paying the debt holders the full value of their claims -- which would amount to roughly $800 million including interest -- in cash or in new debt, in exchange for ownership of Rockefeller Center.
Once creditors whose claims are secured by a debtor's assets are fully repaid, they no longer have a say in the bankruptcy process.
Holders of equity, however, are not so lucky, since their shares are not secured by assets. And the trust's shareholders, some analysts suggest, might end up with nothing, since their claims, unlike the claims of the debt holders, are not secured by any of the partnerships' assets.
As of December, two big banks, Wells Fargo and Bankers Trust, were the two largest shareholders of the trust. But most shareholders are individuals lured to the investment by the glamour of the Rockefeller name and a handsome dividend.
The trust is sure to argue that its shareholders are, in fact, secured by the mortgage, which is backed by Rockefeller Center. And it is unclear whether the partnerships could cut a deal with the trust's debt holders directly unless the trust itself filed for bankruptcy.
In February, Douglas Elliman & Company valued Rockefeller Center at $1.25 billion, and the trust is likely to contend that after paying debt holders, Mitsubishi should give its shareholders $450 million, or the difference between the secured claims and the property's estimated value.
At that value, shareholders would receive almost $12 for their shares, which were trading at $5.25 yesterday, up 25 cents from Wednesday, when the New York Stock Exchange stopped trading in anticipation of the bankruptcy filing.

Rockefeller Center Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy
 Rockefeller Center was forced to file for bankruptcy protection from its creditors by the Japanese company that controls it. The move is expected to have little effect on the center, which has long been a symbol of wealth, commerce and power the world over. 
 But the filing is likely to incite a legal fight over the buildings' ownership, as Mitsubishi Estate squares off against the real estate investment trust that holds the $1.3 billion mortgage on the property. A1.
 As recently as Monday, David Rockefeller thought there was a deal to avoid the bankruptcy, but then the deal fell through early Tuesday morning. D4.
What does the filing say about New York? Some real estate executives said the filing could affect perceptions about the New York property market. D4.
 
Committees Approve Budget Plan
 Budget committees in the House and Senate approved separate plans aimed at balancing the budget over seven years. A1.

HEADLINE: Disney and Developer Are Chosen To Build 42d Street Hotel Complex

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
In the first tangible sign that the long-awaited redevelopment of a tawdry stretch of Eighth Avenue is more than a pipe dream, the Disney Development Company and a large New York developer were chosen yesterday to build a huge hotel, entertainment and retail complex on 42d Street at Eighth Avenue.
The $303 million project is the centerpiece of state and city efforts to transform 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues from a seedy strip with its ever-present hustlers and sex shops into a glitzy family-oriented entertainment center. 
 The developers, who still have to line up financing for the project, hope to break ground sometime in 1996 and complete the project in three to four years. The development will include a 680-room hotel, a multilevel entertainment and retail arcade and perhaps a 100-unit time-share hotel.
The city put up $35 million to condemn and acquire the site at the northeast corner of 42d Street and Eighth Avenue. In return, city officials said, the city and the state will receive about $56 million in taxes and leasing fees over a 20-year period. In addition, the project is expected to generate 3,000 construction jobs and 1,400 permanent jobs.
But perhaps of even more value is the Disney name. In its effort to turn around a neighborhood long synonymous with urban danger and degradation, the city now has a partner that is a symbol of wholesome entertainment worldwide.
While Disney has been pushed to the front of the stage as the star of the project, as a development partner it will serve as a supporting player.
Disney's partner, Tishman Urban Development Corporation, will build the hotel, raise funds for the project and operate the hotel or find a company to do so. Disney will be responsible for developing the retail and entertainment portion of the project.
Disney already has a growing presence in New York. In addition to the project announced yesterday, the company is close to completing a deal with the city to renovate the New Amsterdam Theater, just to the east of the hotel site. According to David L. Malmuth, vice president for corporate real estate at the Disney Development Company, the company is also developing a superstore on Fifth Avenue and 55th Street.
And of course the Disney musical "Beauty and the Beast" is still drawing crowds on Broadway.
The selection of the winning developers from several competitors was a closely guarded secret until the announcement yesterday, which itself had a theatrical air. In the presence of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki, state officials and executives from Tishman and Disney, smoke was blown across a darkened stage in the Academy Theater on 43d Street as a gold curtain was raised to reveal a spotlighted model of the planned hotel project.
Charles Gargano, the chairman of the State Urban Development Corporation, said the developers were selected for the spirit and sophistication of their design.
"Times Square represents the vibrancy, creativity and soul of New York and is worth preserving," Mr. Gargano said, "It is the town square of America and tourists come from all over the world to drink up the atmosphere."
Still to be arranged is the financing for the $303 million project. John L. Tishman, chairman and C.E.O. of Tishman, said that money for the retail property will probably come from a commercial bank after some leases have been signed. Financing for the hotel and time-share project, Mr. Tishman said, will likely come from several equity investors.
The Eighth Avenue hotel is only one part of the Times Square redevelopment project. Another key property in the 10-year-old effort to redevelop Times Square and 42d Street still in the works is the development of four office towers around the intersection of Seventh Avenue and 42d Street.
Last August, the developers of that property, the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty, retained their stake in the project by agreeing to pay more than $20 million to refurbish storefronts in the buildings that have been condemned and emptied of tenants in preparation for redevelopment. In the meantime the space will be leased to interim tenants while the developers wait for the office market to rebound.
The design for the hotel and entertainment complex, which will replace a string of derelict buildings diagonally across the Port Authority Bus Terminal, is an eye-popping mix.
The 47-story hotel, designed by Arquitectonica, a Miami-based architectural firm, was designed to appear as if it split into two parts by a streak of light on its facade. The 615,000-square-foot hotel will have its main entrance on 43d Street.
The part of the project that will hold the proposed time-share units is a 10-story building with a glass-mosaic facade featuring postcard images of New York. At street level, running 400 feet along 42d Street, will be the retail and entertainment portion of the project, and it will include the renovation of the Case Building. Disney will be an anchor tenant of this part of the project and Sega, the entertainment company, has expressed an interest in leasing 28,000 square feet in the basement of one of the buildings.
There will also be a two-story, 12,000-square-foot restaurant on the Eighth Avenue corner of the project.
As required by the design guidelines for the project, there will be 10 to 12 huge signs scattered at various heights throughout the project.
The Tishman-Disney team won the right to develop the project over seven applicants that included two other finalists, Marriott International and Triarc Equities, and Milstein Properties and Weiler Arnow Management.

The announcement yesterday that Disney Development Company is part of the winning bid to develop a hotel project on Eighth Avenue, between 42d and 43d streets, is just the latest sign that the Walt Disney Company has set its sights on New York.
The hotel, to be developed by Dream Team Associates, an affiliate of Tishman Urban Development Corporation, will include an "entertainment component," to be developed by Disney Development Company.
 
ON BROADWAY -- More than 800,000 people have see "Beauty and the Beast" since it opened April 18, 1994, at the Palace Theater. Sarah Uriarte and Jeff McCarthy play the title roles in the Disney musical, which has an unlimited run.
 
ON FIFTH AVENUE -- Construction for a store, with merchandise related to Disney movies and characters, has begun. The two-level store, in the Coca-Cola Building at 711 Fifth Avenue, is expected to open next year.
 
ON 42d STREET -- Disney has signed a 49-year lease to the 92-year-old New Amsterdam Theater, though it can get out of the deal by July 15 if certain conditions are not met. When renovated, in about 18 months, be used to stage Disney shows. The city and state would be paid based on revnues.
 
IN CENTRAL PARK -- On June 10, Disney will take over the Great Lawn of Central Park for the premiere of its animated film "Pocahontas." Eight projectors will be used to show special 70-millimeter prints of the film, which will be projected onto four eight-story-tall screens.
 
IN TIMES SQUARE -- As part of the first anniversary of "Beauty and the Beast" on Broadway, Walt Disney Theatrical Productions provided banners for the Times Square Business Improvement District. They will remain up for about three months. ELLEN C. LESSER

HEADLINE: A Deal Brought Cachet, but Cash Is Another Matter

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

 BODY:
"Japanese Buy New York Cachet With Deal for Rockefeller Center," a headline in The New York Times proclaimed in 1989, when the Mitsubishi Estate Company bought a majority stake in one of the city's enduring symbols.
So when the Japanese company forced Rockefeller Center to file for bankruptcy protection yesterday, questions inevitably arose in the corridors of finance: 
 What does the filing say about New York? Or about the Japanese?
And could it be that cachet, like class, can be acquired but never bought? Or that Rockefeller Center, the towering Art Deco complex that sprawls over 22 acres, has a cachet that exists apart from the world of finance?
"This will hurt New York because of erroneous perceptions," said Meyer S. Frucher, executive vice president of the giant real estate company Olympia & York U.S.A., which itself has taken its blows in the New York real estate market. "It should not hurt New York, because this is a case of an investment gone awry rather than a city gone astray."
Similar views were expressed by William Tung, vice president for corporate real estate for the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann. "The Japanese are learning to behave more like Americans, which means they will explore the bankruptcy system," he said.
Mr. Tung said that in Japanese culture, one who does not pay his debts is dishonored. But he said he did not expect any Mitsubishi executives to fall "on their swords over this -- they're learning to deal with how business is done here."
Warren Wechsler, first senior vice president for the Real Estate Board of New York, resisted the temptation to make sweeping judgments about the Chapter 11 filing, or to see parables about greed of the 1980's sowing seeds of ruin in the 1990's.
"This is so complicated, it's a sui generis situation," he said. Acknowledging that, yes, some people will take pleasure in seeing the Japanese come up short, he suggested that troubles in Japan's economy might have led to some bad decisions. "I don't think it's fair to laugh," he said.
At Rockefeller Center yesterday, it was business as usual, or almost.
"Nothing is going to change as far as the life of the tenants and the operation of the buildings," said Michael Claes, a spokesman for the center's operating partnership. "In many ways, no one will notice the difference."
That seemed to be true, at least among some merchants. A worker in a candy store was asked whether the Chapter 11 filing meant anything to her. "Truthfully, sir, I have no idea what you're talking about," she said before ringing up a $1.26 sale for a raspberry truffle.
But M. Mizrahi, the manager of a watch shop on the Rockefeller Center concourse, was a bit concerned by the bankruptcy filing. "It means the proposals for betterment of the concourse might not happen," he said. And that, he said, could mean fewer customers.

HEADLINE: Man Is Charged in 7 Fires At Jewish Centers in Queens

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
A 39-year-old man whose father was Jewish was charged yesterday with having set a series of fires at synagogues, yeshivas and a Jewish center over the past year that have shaken Jews in the Far Rockaway area of Queens.
The fires had conjured up images of anti-Semitism, but the police said the arsonist's motive was anger at his mother, not bias. The man, Brian Bebeck, was arrested and charged yesterday with seven counts of arson and one count of attempted arson. 
 The police said Mr. Bebeck, an unemployed man whom they described as mentally unstable, had worn a yarmulke while setting some of the fires. He apparently set them after arguments with his mother, with whom he shares an apartment in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn. Mr. Bebeck was reared as a Catholic by his mother, the police said. His father died in 1978.
Mr. Bebeck faces a maximum of 22 years in prison on the charges, the Queens District Attorney's Office said.
The first fire was set at Congregation Derech-Emunoh on July 14, 1994, and the most recent occurred last Saturday at Yeshiva of Belle Harbor.
The police said that Mr. Bebeck, after arguing with his mother, would typically take a bus to Far Rockaway. There, he had found rabbis and synagogue officials receptive to hard-luck stories he would tell them -- for instance, that he needed money for his sick mother.
The police said that Mr. Bebeck set the fires whether he was given money or not and that he received at least several hundred dollars a week panhandling at the synagogues.
Rabbis at Ohab-Tzedek Synagogue called the police when they suspected that Mr. Bebeck stole a donation box full of coins. On being questioned on Wednesday, Mr. Bebeck confessed to having set the fires, the authorities said.
Mr. Bebeck was also arrested in September 1989 for grand larceny, according to detectives at the 100th Precinct in Far Rockaway, who declined to reveal the outcome of that case.
But they did say he was not responsible for a dozen other fires at Jewish centers and businesses in the area. Those, they said, were the work of youths who had already been arrested and charged.
Mr. Bebeck has no history of mental illness, according to his mother, Alice Bebeck, 76, who talked about her son at a neighbor's house yesterday.
Mrs. Bebeck said that on learning her son was arrested, "I fell down the stairs -- I was in shock." Her ankle bore bruises, and a bump was visible on her head. She said her son had moved in with her less than a month ago after being evicted from his apartment two blocks away.
She described Brian as an attentive son who brought her gifts on her birthday and Mother's Day. She said he liked to go out dancing with friends in Bensonhurst nightclubs.
"Brian is very nervous, but he's a nice kid," she said. "We would get into arguments sometimes and he would fly off the handle."
She said he spoke a bit of Yiddish he had learned at the synagogues.
"It's not bias-related," said Charles G. Reuther, the Chief of Detectives, in describing the series of fires. "He had a great affinity for the Jewish community. We're dealing with an individual who is somewhat unstable."
Since the very first blaze was set, police detectives had ruled out bias as a motive, because no anti-Semitic messages were left. But after other Jewish sites in the area became targets, residents began to worry.
"It scared them terribly," said Antony Anisman, assistant director of the Anti-Defamation League. "They did not know where and when the next fire would be. With this arrest, the Jewish community breathed a sigh of relief."
Robert Wein, president of Congregation Derech-Emunoh, said yesterday, "I'm very glad that they caught him. Unfortunately for us, they caught him a few weeks too late."
The 90-year-old synagogue was set ablaze on April 30 for the second time in eight months. Mr. Bebeck is charged with having set both fires.
The second blaze was particularly distressing because repairs from the first had just been completed. Residents spent months raising money and working to repair the weatherbeaten neo-Georgian synagogue at 199 Beach 67th Street and Rockaway Beach Boulevard in the Arverne section of Queens.
Most of the fires were not severe, and were started in garbage cans behind the synagogues.
Mr. Bebeck is charged with having set fires at Yeshiva of Belle Harbor; Congregation Shaare Zedek of Edgemere; Young Israel of Far Rockaway; Glatt Mart Kosher Center, a community center; two fires at Congregation Derech-Emunoh, and one fire plus one attempt at a fire at Temple Beth El.

HEADLINE: Treaty Aimed at Halting Spread Of Nuclear Weapons Extended

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 11

 BODY:
More than 170 nations agreed today to extend in perpetuity a treaty that has limited the spread of nuclear arms for a quarter of a century.
The Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, a bedrock agreement in Soviet-American relations that arose in the midst of the cold war, became permanent today by acclamation.
The original treaty, which went into effect in 1970, had to be reviewed this year, to decide whether it should be extended for a set period, ended, or prolonged indefinitely. The treaty basically limits nuclear weapons to the five states that had proclaimed them at the time -- the United States, Britain, France, China and the Soviet Union, now Russia. All other signers had to promise not to acquire them. 
 Today's announcement followed four weeks of sometimes bitter debate between those five declared nuclear powers, all of whom favored indefinite extension, and nations without nuclear arms, many of which were just emerging from colonialism when the treaty was written and were hesitant to see it extended in its present form indefinitely.
They argued that the treaty had allowed a small number of countries to have a monopoly over nuclear arms and that these nations were not providing nuclear technology for peaceful uses.
When the conference opened last month, the United States and its allies, among them Russia, faced formidable opposition to an indefinite and unconditional extension of the treaty, and did not have enough declared votes for a simple majority had there been a ballot, according to independent estimates.
Over the weeks, however, the opposition, led by larger developing nations -- among them Mexico, Venezuela, Egypt, Nigeria and Indonesia -- began to split.
The eventual collapse of the opposition to an indefinite extension was hastened by the decision of South Africa to back such a plan and propose a package of confidence-building documents that would meet some of the concerns of the non-nuclear-weapons nations. South Africa has said it abolished its nuclear weapons program, and signed the treaty in 1992.
That package became the basis for negotiations led by the conference's president, Jayantha Dhanapala of Sri Lanka, to find enough common ground for consensus on extending the treaty indefinitely.
In the last 48 hours, President Clinton personally campaigned for the indefinite extension, writing what a United States official called "tough messages" to Egypt and Mexico, emphasizing the importance of the issue to the United States. The official said that there were no threats implied, but that it was made clear that the United States would find it hard to understand why friendly nations that had received help from Washington would not be more cooperative.
Overnight Wednesday, Egypt changed course, abandoning a last-minute effort to name Israel as a violator of the treaty. Israel, India and Pakistan have not signed the treaty and have reportedly pursued nuclear weapons programs outside the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Other nations who have not signed the treaty include Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
Another group of countries, including North Korea, Iran and Iraq, have signed the treaty but have in the past worked on nuclear weapons programs or are now believed to be doing so.
During the conference, which began on April 17, the Administration set up a 24-hour monitoring operation in Washington to keep track of the positions of key countries and a running tally of the nations that supported an indefinite extension.
"It has been a long hard road, but we have finally reached our destination," Madeleine K. Albright, the United States representative at the United Nations, said at a news conference after the treaty was extended indefinitely. "By reducing the risk that additional countries will become nuclear powers, this sterling success should make the world a safer place for all of us, for our children, and for their children."
Ms. Albright called the treaty "a very important legacy" and said President Clinton had made the treaty's extension "one of his highest foreign policy priorities."
Since January the Administration has made several conciliatory gestures on arms-control issues, most prominently by dropping the demand for an "easy out" clause in talks on a test-ban treaty now going on in Geneva. The Administration now pledges to get the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia, the so-called Start II treaty, ratified by the Senate, where it is languishing in a committee.
Thomas Graham, the Administration's special representative on arms control, traveled for more than a year promoting a permanent extension of the nonproliferation treaty, diplomats and administration officials say. Miguel Marin-Bosch, the deputy head of the Mexican delegation at the conference, said in an interview that the campaign had been impressive. He declined to comment, however, on persistent reports that the Administration had used its economic leverage with Mexico as a tool.
In the last few weeks, some envoys say, quiet diplomacy has turned to more forceful means of pressure by American ambassadors and Administration officials lobbying foreign embassies in Washington.
On Monday, the head of Venezuela's negotiating team, Adolfo Taylhardat, resigned after his Government suddenly changed its position from backing a limited and conditional extension to joining the United States in sponsoring a permanent renewal. In an interview, Mr. Taylhardat said this would not have happened if American pressure on Caracas had not been so intense.
The treaty created a global system that reserved to only five nations the legitimate possession of nuclear arms, a cause of dissent then and now. But as a compromise the accord, which went into force in 1970, gave itself a life of 25 years, after which it could be extended again for fixed periods or become permanent. In those intervening years, most nations -- though not all -- have apparently decided not to pursue the nuclear option.
The result of years of negotiations in the 1960's when the United States and the Soviet Union were locked in an arms race, a space race and intense competition for the loyalty of the newly independent nations, the nonproliferation treaty began the long, slow and still unfinished job of controlling and finally eliminating all weapons of mass destruction.
It formed the cornerstone on which other treaties were built, on missiles, chemical and biological weapons and atomic testing.
When the treaty was signed in 1968 in Washington, London and Moscow, there were fears that a dozen or more nations would soon possess the knowledge and fuel for atomic bombs. Presidents Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy had sought to control nuclear weapons.
"People were much closer to nuclear devastation as seen in Hiroshima and Nagasaki," said Joseph Ciricione, the executive director of the Campaign for the Nonproliferation Treaty, a coalition of independent arms control research organizations. "Read what Eisenhower said, or Kennedy: 'The weapons of war must be abolished before they abolish us.' "
President Johnson signed the treaty on July 1, 1968, and President Nixon put it into effect two years later. To date, 178 nations have signed the accord.
Today the treaty was extended indefinitely as part of a package with companion documents calling for more progress in disarmament and a strengthened system of monitoring compliance with the pact.
The conference also adopted by consensus a separate, rewritten resolution on the situation in the Middle East that had delayed final action on the nonproliferation treaty for a day.
Today's crucial session was delayed by a last-minute dissent from Iran and Syria to the Middle East resolution, which as originally submitted by 14 Arab nations was intended to draw attention to Israel's undeclared nuclear program. That resolution was resubmitted today by the United States, Britain and Russia with specific references to Israel removed but including other language linking moves toward regional disarmament to the Middle East peace talks.
Syria, which has not concluded a peace agreement with Israel, and Iran, an Islamic but not an Arab nation and thus not an original sponsor of the resolution, finally agreed to new wording that mentioned the peace effort as one of several roads toward making the region safer and free of nuclear weapons.
The negotiations, which went on in a corner of the General Assembly hall as delegates milled around, held up the start of the meeting by about two hours.
Although the treaty was adopted by consensus to avoid a vote, which most delegations here feared would weaken it if the tally fell short of unanimity, more than a dozen nations gave critical speeches after the decision to make the treaty permanent.
Malaysia's delegate to the conference, Hasmy bin Agam, reflected the view of a number of other developing nations when he said the treaty provided a carte blanche to the nuclear powers. He said the accord could be interpreted as "justifying nuclear weapons states for eternity."
In the Statement of Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Nonproliferation and Disarmament, one of the documents that was adopted today, the nuclear powers pledged to reduce and ultimately move toward elimination of their arms.
The statement calls for "the determined pursuit by nuclear-weapon states of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons."
Nuclear-weapon nations also committed themselves to concluding a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing in 1996.
In extending the treaty, the signers also strengthened the process of reviewing compliance by introducing yearly assessments beginning in 1997. Substantive issues concerning the treaty could also be raised in those meetings, as well as in more extensive five-year reviews.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 13, 1995, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about an accord for indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons misstated the options facing the conference at which the accord was reached. The gathering was to choose among three options -- indefinite extension, extension for a fixed period and extensions for a series of fixed periods. Ending the treaty was not an option.

Market Ignores Inflation As Stocks Continue Surge
Stocks pushed higher, with the Dow Jones industrials rising 19.37 to a record 4,430.56, as traders ignored the strong hints of inflation in the Consumer Price Index for April and instead expressed confidence that the Federal Reserve would not need to raise interest rates again.
Capping a week of small but steady advances, the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 1.18 point to 525.55, also a record, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 5.11 points to 858.94, another high. For the week, the Dow advanced more than 87 points. Page 37.
A calm bond market helped lift stocks. Bond prices rose modestly, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.99 percent, from 7 percent on Thursday. 36.
The dollar extended its rally, gaining 1 percent against both the German mark and the Japanese yen. 32.
 
Religious Leaders to Seek Ban on Genetic Patents
Many leaders from virtually every major religion in the United States plan to ask the Government next week to prohibit the current patenting practices for genetic engineering, contending that being able to patent a human gene violates the sanctity of human life and reduces what some call the "blueprint of evolution" to a marketable commodity.
The petition has been endorsed by roughly 100 Catholic bishops, Protestant and Jewish leaders and groups of American Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists. The industry says patents are crucial to commercial biotechnology, and that in seeking to cure diseases it is playing doctor, not God. 1.
 
First-Quarter Loss for T.C.I.
Tele-Communications Inc. posted a loss of 8 cents a share, countering Wall Street's expectations of earnings of about a penny a share. The giant cable operator said its revenues rose 44 percent, partly because of its merger with Liberty Media. 35.
 
Judge Lifts Ad Ban in Implant Case
A state judge in Reno ruled that Dow Corning has a right to publish advertisements in newspapers despite its forthcoming trial involving a breast implant patient. The ruling came two days after the judge ordered the company and other parties involved in the pending lawsuit not to speak to the public or media. The judge had imposed the emergency order in response to a full-page advertisement discussing implants that Dow Corning placed in several newspapers. 7.
 
Merger of Movie Chains Called Off
The proposed merger between Cineplex Odeon and Cinemark USA, which would have created the world's largest movie-theater chain, has been called off. The deal fell apart amid a series of unforeseen changes in the world economy and shifts in corporate power, Wall Street analysts said. The companies said that even without a merger, they have not ruled out cooperating on ventures in the future. 35.
 
Unions Agree to Combine
The governing board of the United Rubber Workers union approved a proposal to merge with the United Steelworkers in a move to shore up the sagging strength of organized labor. The board of the Steelworkers' union is to vote on the matter on Monday. 37.
 
Budget Chief Focused on Deficit
Senator Pete Domenici enjoys a universal reputation as one of the Senate's hardest- working and most intelligent members. As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, he is also the acknowledged master of the nuances of the Federal budget. But his single-minded pursuit of lowering the deficit has sometimes left him in the political wilderness on Capitol Hill and possibly cost him higher standing within the Republican Party. 1.
 
Cuba Considering Layoffs
The Cuban Government is renouncing the guarantee of lifetime employment in an effort to make Cuba's sagging economy more efficient, and it has begun layoffs that are expected to affect 800,000 people. Officials say the cuts are essential if Cuba is to emerge from the economic crisis brought on by the collapse of the Soviet bloc. 1.
 
Wheat Prices Rise on Midwest Rain
Wheat prices continued to surge, reaching their highest levels in three months as rains forecast for the Midwest threatened to delay spring planting. 32.

HEADLINE: Arthur Hill, Finance Executive And Ex-Ginnie Mae Chief, 46

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Arthur J. Hill, a prominent Florida banker and securities executive who was one of the highest-ranking African-American officials in the Bush Administration, was found dead on Wednesday morning in his hotel room at the Airport Hilton in Elizabeth, N.J., where he had attended a dinner of the Republican Governors Association the night before. He was 46 and lived in Miami.
The office of the Union County Medical Examiner said the cause of death was a heart attack. 
 Mr. Hill managed the public financing branch of New York-based Prudential Securities in Boca Raton, Fla. He had held a number of banking positions in that state, including chairman and president of the Peoples National Bank of Commerce, Miami's only black-owned bank.
In 1989, President George Bush called him to Washington, where he first headed the Government National Mortgage Association and later became Commissioner of Housing at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. His responsibilities during his years in Washington included the management of more than 40 Government-backed mortgage insurance programs totaling $400 billion, the preservation and rehabilitation of housing, and the management of HUD's foreclosed properties.
Mr. Hill, who grew up in Jacksonville, Fla., was a graduate of Florida Memorial College in Miami and of Southern Methodist University's Graduate School of Banking. He also earned a master's degree in agriculture economics at the University of Florida.
He is survived by his wife, Licia Green-Hill; two daughters, Lolita Hill of Washington and 1-year-old Maria; a sister, Clatties Dawkins; and two brothers, Dr. Charmie L. Hill and the Rev. Kenneth Hill.

HEADLINE: Thousands Turn Out to Cheer Clinton in Ukraine

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, May 12

 BODY:
President Clinton stood before an enormous outdoor rally in this capital today to pay another tribute to the course Ukraine has chosen since the Soviet Union's collapse.
As more than 15,000 Ukrainians packed into a wooded plaza of the city's premier university, Mr. Clinton left no doubt that his sentiments were very different than those voiced here by President George Bush in 1991, in a speech that was seen as a caution that Ukraine should not stray from the Soviet fold. 
 "God bless America," Mr. Clinton said, then switched to Ukrainian to add, "Glory to Ukraine."
As Mr. Clinton headed home to Washington after four days here in and Moscow, the White House pointed to what it called Ukraine's "stunning turnaround" as evidence that American foreign policy was paying dividends even if this trip did not produce a major success.
This morning's pushing, surging crowd was so vast that hundreds of Ukrainian troops had to be rushed to the scene to reinforce barricades. And while most of those in the crowd showed little reaction as a translator rendered Mr. Clinton's 30-minute address, a throaty cheer broke out as the President hailed a country that the Administration regards as a warm friend.
"I commend you for taking the hard road, for putting the needs of your future and your nation above immediate personal concerns," Mr. Clinton said. "Your efforts will be repaid, for your independent country has a better chance to create freedom and prosperity than it has had in centuries."
A day after more than 170 nations agreed to extend in perpetuity the treaty limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, the President said Ukraine deserved credit for forsaking the nuclear arsenal it inherited from the Soviet Union. And he praised the "bold and farsighted leadership" of President Leonid Kuchma, who since being elected last July has set about reforming Ukraine's economy.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, which is to be completed next year, along with Russia's agreement this week to cancel part of a nuclear accord with Iran, had made Americans more secure. He also defended the modest achievements of Mr. Clinton's meeting this week with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
"The President set out for Russia and Ukraine with fairly limited objectives, and he is satisfied that those objectives have been met," Mr. McCurry said. Asked how the White House intended to counter criticism from Republican opponents about its foreign policy record, Mr. McCurry said it would "engage in that debate vigorously because this Administration believes it has a very good record to defend."
Today, Mr. Clinton made only an oblique reference to the visit that Mr. Bush made here four years ago, when his warning against "suicidal nationalism" was taken by many Ukrainians as an affront.
"I am deeply honored to be the first American President to appear before the people of a free and independent Ukraine," Mr. Clinton said, standing before the crowd at Schevchenko University.
As did Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton made a solemn pilgrimage to Babi Yar, a ravine that is the site of a mass grave of more than 100,000 victims, many of them Jews, who were killed by special squads of Nazi soldiers during the German occupation of this capital from 1941-1943.
Mr. Clinton visited both a memorial built by the Soviet Government in 1976, which does not mention that a large number of those killed were Jews, and a 10-foot-high menorah erected by Jewish organizations since Mr. Bush's visit to call attention to the Jewish tragedy.
"In the quiet of this place, the victims of Babi Yar cry out to us still," Mr. Clinton said. "Never forget, they tell us, that humanitiy is capable of the worst, just as it is capable of the best."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Clinton Claims Success
 ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE, May 12 (AP) -- President Clinton said today that his summit meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin went better than most people had expected and that the Russian leader was "cordial, clearheaded and very direct" about Iran and Chechnya.
"I felt quite good about this trip," Mr. Clinton told reporters aboard Air Force One on his way home from Russia and Ukraine.
Citing progress on arms control, he said his overall Russian policy is "clearly a success."

Rockefeller Center Filing May Mean Big Tax Bill

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
While the bankruptcy-law filing by Rockefeller Center saved the Mitsubishi Estate Company from pumping more money into the cash-short property, it could cost the Japanese company as much as $190 million in taxes, accountants and analysts said yesterday.
Initial consideration of the fate of the landmark 12-building center was put off yesterday until a hearing in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan on June 11. But Judge Prudence B. Abram approved a plan for as much as $50 million in interim financing so the center can pay its bills for the next month. 
 Representatives of Mitsubishi, the 80 percent owner of the center, and the Rockefeller family, which owns the remaining 20 percent, yesterday accused each other of negotiating in bad faith during the last few weeks as they tried to forge a bailout plan that would avoid a bankruptcy filing and the associated tax bill.
Rockefeller Center has been in a financial squeeze because the payments on its $1.3 billion mortgage are greater than its income from rent. The two parties were close to a plan that would have substantially reduced the center's annual debt payments by buying outright the mortgage lender: a special-purpose real estate trust called Rockefeller Center Properties.
They were preparing to offer to buy the mortgage lender's stock for $7.50 a share. The offer would also have given the mortgage lender's stockholders the right to participate in future profits from the center, according to people involved with the deal. Its stock had been trading between $5 and $6, but was suspended from trading yesterday by the New York Stock Exchange.
The deal broke down over how the two parties would allocate the approximately $270 million cost of the mortgage lender's stock. The Rockefellers originally proposed contributing their 20 percent share, about $54 million. But Mitsubishi wanted the Rockefellers to put up another $38 million, as a token recognition of the family's enormous gain from the sale.
"The money we were going to put up was on top of our enormous losses, while they were just going to reinvest some of their huge profits," an adviser to Mitsubishi said, speaking on the condition that he not be named. The Rockefellers eventually agreed to put up the $38 million, but they insisted on receiving interest of 12 percent and repayment in five years.
William G. Bowen, chairman of the Rockefeller Trust Committee, said, "We were willing to do more than our pro rata share, but the terms of that additional investment had to make business sense."
The Rockefellers eventually agreed to somewhat more relaxed terms, but they did not offer enough soon enough to satisfy Mitsubishi, advisers to the Japanese company said.
The few million dollars a year in interest that the Rockefellers asked for would be a far lower cost to Mitsubishi than the huge tax bill and other consequences of the bankruptcy filing, but its adviser said that was not its only motivation.
"The tax consequences of the bankruptcy will be far more than the $38 million," the adviser said. "But we were not making decisions purely as a matter of economics. We wanted a gesture from the Rockefeller family on concessionary terms."
The tax bill is likely to be high because when debt is restructured, as it often is in bankruptcy negotiations, the amount of the principal forgiven is treated as taxable income. Even worse, from a tax point of view, if the mortgage lender repossesses the property, which would be the most extreme outcome of the bankruptcy filing, the entire amount of the mortgage is treated as income.
Under that worst-case sequence of events, Rockefeller Group, the owner of the center in which Mitsubishi has an 80 percent stake, would record income of $1.3 billion -- the mortgage amount. It would deduct its cost, minus depreciation on the building and property, which is listed in the bankruptcy-law filing at $713 million.
Federal and local taxes on the nearly $600 million gain would be about $240 million, although the center's accumulated operating losses could be deducted from the gain.
This would nonetheless be a significant financial blow to the Rockefeller Group and Mitsubishi's $1.4 billion investment in the group. The group owns several valuable properties -- including the McGraw-Hill building and the real estate company of Cushman & Wakefield -- in addition to its more problematic holding of Rockefeller Center proper.

HEADLINE: Stocks Continue to Climb Despite More Inflation Hints

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stocks, the 30-year bond and the dollar all moved higher yesterday, with major stock indexes setting records. Traders ignored even stronger hints of inflation in the Consumer Price Index and continued in their confidence that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates.
Capping a week of small but steady advances, the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 19.37 points, to 4,430.56, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.18 points, to 525.55, also a record. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index gained 5.11 points, to 858.94, another all-time high. 
 For the week, the Dow climbed more than 87 points.
As if to confirm the financial markets' faith in the future, the price of gold, a widely followed fever chart of market anxiety, fell even further yesterday. Gold for June delivery traded at $384.30, down 10 cents, on the Commodity Exchange of New York.
"There's plenty of liquidity fueling this market," said Tracy Herrick, chief investment strategist for Jefferies & Company.
"At some point," said Todd Clark, managing director for equity trading at Rodman & Renshaw, "there will be universal bullishness, the market will be unsustainably 'overbought' and prices will be trending sideways despite good news. But none of those three things is happening yet."
Still, technical analysts warned that indicators that have worked in the past seemed to indicate that the stock market was indeed close to being "overbought" -- Wall Street jargon for when prices are too rich and traders are forced to think about selling.
Gregory Nie, senior vice president for technical research at Kemper Securities, said 69.1 percent of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange were trading at prices above their 10-week average. A figure of 70 percent historically means that the market is overbought, according to Mr. Nie.
Nonetheless, market-moving events that would have normally sent stock and bond prices tumbling did not do so this week. Surprisingly slack demand for new 10-year Treasury notes on Wednesday and higher-than-expected readings for producer prices on Thursday and consumer prices yesterday failed to ruffle the bond market or stop stock prices from rising.
The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.44 points, to 487.76, just short of the 1994 record of 487.89. And the Russell 2,000 closed at 269.85, up 0.91 point, but also shy of the 1994 record of 271.08.
Helping lift stock prices was a calm bond market, where traders continued to buy bonds, despite the inflationary readings for the price indexes. Long-term interest rates continued to fall. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.99 percent from 7 percent.
Meanwhile, the dollar rallied for a second day, reinforcing a growing impression among currency traders that it had bottomed out. Analysts said this could cause foreign investors to return to the American stock and bond markets that they had largely abandoned because they were being penalized by the falling dollar.
The dollar rose 1.12 yen, to 86.80 yen, and gained 1.50 pfennings, to 1.4485 marks.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 358.3 million shares changing hands, about 7 percent below this year's daily average of 334 million shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.44 point, to 282.90, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining issues by 1,230 to 991.
Among the gaining stocks was Caterpillar, which rose 3 7/8, to 62 7/8. Olympic Financial, a consumer finance company, jumped 3 1/4, to 60 1/4, after it announced further expansion of its operations in North Carolina.
Among the declining stocks was Hilton Hotels, which traded down for the second day, closing at 69 1/2, a drop of 1 3/4, after traders were disappointed with management's failure to sell the company.
The most active stock, at 6.8 million shares, was Cisco Systems, which rose 1 1/4, to 45. Cisco, a developer of computer networking equipment, reported quarterly earnings of 45 cents a share on Thursday after the market closed, beating analysts' estimates.
In Japan, stocks ended little changed. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed down 40.97 points at 16,420.76. For the week, the Nikkei was down 667.9 points.

HEADLINE: Cuba, in Ideological Retreat, To Lay Off Many Thousands

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA, May 12

 BODY:
In an effort to make Cuba's sagging economy more efficient, the Government is abandoning one of the most cherished concepts of the Communist state, the guarantee of full lifetime employment, and has begun layoffs that are expected to eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs.
By official estimate, as many as 800,000 people, or more than one-fifth of Cuba's total work force, may eventually be affected by the new policy, which began earlier this year and which is intended to reduce overstaffing, cut down on state subsidies and attract foreign investment. 
 The sweeping job cuts are essential, officials have said, if Cuba is to emerge from the profound economic crisis brought on by the collapse of the Soviet bloc six years ago and the resulting loss of trade and aid for Cuba.
During a recent appearance on a radio program here, the Minister of Labor and Social Security, Salvador Valdes, shied away from setting a timetable for the job restructuring, saying, "It must be gradual and controlled, not abrupt, and accompanied by a recovery of the economy." But he also warned workers to get used to the idea of unemployment, saying that "we have to restructure over-inflated work forces" in order to compete in the world economy.
The effort to eliminate superfluous jobs comes as the Clinton Administration and the Government of President Fidel Castro have agreed to an immigration accord that ends the United States policy, in effect for three decades, of granting political asylum to all Cubans who reach American shores. With the door to the United States closed, diplomats and other analysts contend that creating a large contingent of idled workers can only stoke the same domestic pressures and privations that led to outbursts of popular unrest here last summer.
"If they really start dismissing hundreds of thousands of people, that creates a huge political problem" unless other sweeping reforms of the economy also take place, said Carmelo Mesa-Lago, a Cuban-born specialist on the Cuban economy who is a visiting professor at Florida International University in Miami. "They cannot hope to hide 500,000 dismissed workers and pretend that they will be relocated within the private sector."
In various speeches he has made this year, President Castro has said that though the job restructuring is inevitable, the state has an obligation to provide a social safety net for laid-off workers. The Government budget for 1995 includes a 58 percent increase in social assistance payments, much of it apparently to cover salary guarantees for the jobless.
Cuban officials have said they plan to shift the workers left without jobs by the streamlining of state enterprises into other sectors of the economy and to expand the number of self-employed people in trades and crafts. But they acknowledge that those efforts, which would result in weakening state control, have been slowed by a prolonged internal debate.
"These decisions imply a fundamental change in Cuba's economic model and are the object of polemic and discussion," said Julio Carranza, co-author of a new book titled "Restructuring the Cuban Economy" and deputy director of the Center for the Study of the Americas, an official research institute here. "There is still ideological resistance in a conservative sector, but there is clearly a pressure to be pragmatic."
Indeed, the new policy is so controversial that the Communist Party is still struggling to find the proper terminology to describe what is taking place. Along with universal health care, education and housing, nominal guaranteed employment is regarded as one of the great triumphs of the Cuban revolution.
"There are no dismissals and there are no layoffs," said Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban Workers' Central, the official labor union confederation. "If that were the case, we would be saying that the revolution is disappearing."
Instead, Mr. Ross said, Cuba is undergoing "a process of rationalization of employment" that is producing a corps of "available workers" who have agreed to "voluntary relocation." In recent declarations in the official Cuban news media, and again in an interview in his office this week, he estimated that 500,000 to 800,000 workers could eventually be "rationalized."
Thus far, layoffs have been limited and largely confined to sectors of the economy where foreign investment has been directed or is being sought. Among the places where layoffs have attracted the most attention are a nickel mining project, a mineral water bottling plant and one of Havana's largest hotels, the Havana Libre, which is now managed by a Spanish company.
By this week, Mr. Ross said, the jobs of 80,926 workers had been phased out. Of these, he said, 59,815 have been shifted to new jobs, while "the others are at home receiving a state subsidy" that amounts to 60 percent of their wages "or have gone to work for themselves and renounced the right to a subsidy."
Under regulations announced last September, workers who are laid off are entitled to one month's full pay and 60 percent of their salary thereafter. Workers who "unjustifiably" refuse a new job, however, are entitled to only one month's pay after the initial month before their payments are ended.
Officials contend that despite the economic decline of recent years, a few sectors, like agriculture and tourism, have labor shortages and could benefit from the larger pool of available workers. But many of those jobs are unpopular, most notably those that require taxing physical labor or moving to the countryside.
"Why would anyone want to leave the city and go to a place where there is nothing to do?" asked a 19-year-old youth, who described himself as an unemployed pipe fitter but who spoke on condition of anonymity.
His 22-year-old friend, who also spoke on condition of anonymity and who said he had last worked as a night watchman at an empty warehouse, said, "You break your back doing that kind of work, and you still go hungry."
Mr. Carranza, who is closely identified with economic reform proposals, said that the best way for the Cuban economy to absorb those dismissed from their jobs would be to liberalize the regulations announced late in 1993 that govern self-employment. Since then, more than 160,000 self-employment licenses have been issued to tradesman from the 117 occupations included in the system, such as mechanics, artisans and plumbers.
"The entry barriers must be eliminated and the process must be simultaneous with the rationalization of jobs," he said. "If not, it will be impossible to absorb the excess labor force in the state sector."
Currently, however, self-employed workers are not allowed to hire other employees, a necessary step if small private enterprises are to thrive. The regulations also prohibit professionals with college degrees, like teachers, architects and engineers, from working for themselves.
"It really bugs me that my boyfriend, who is a mechanic, is allowed to work for himself and I can't," said a 28-year-old nurse. "Why should I be punished just because I have a couple of degrees?"
Diplomats and other analysts said that the approach Cuba seems to be taking differs significantly from that of other Communist countries, like China, and former members of the Soviet bloc. China, for instance, moved first to privatize agriculture and then small manufacturing enterprises, thereby creating job opportunities, before eliminating the system known as the "iron rice bowl."
"Job creation should precede dismissals, and that's what I don't see here," Dr. Mesa-Lago said. "And that is dangerous."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
RELIGIOUS LEADERS PREPARE TO FIGHT PATENTS ON GENES

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Opening what could be a passionate new battle over religion and science, many mainstream religious leaders are about to start a campaign against a financial pillar of the biotechnology industry: the ability to patent human genes and genetically engineered animals.
Leaders from virtually every major religion in the United States plan to issue a joint statement next week asking the Government to prohibit the current patenting practices for genetic engineering. To do so would reverse a 15-year policy that industry executives say was crucial to the birth of commercial biotechnology.
 The statement has been signed by religious leaders across the political and cultural spectrum: roughly 100 Roman Catholic bishops, numerous Protestant and Jewish leaders and groups of American Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists. 
 "This issue is going to dwarf the pro-life debate within a few years," said Richard D. Land, head of the Christian Life Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. "I think we're on the threshold of mind-bending debates about the nature of human life and animal life. We see altering life forms, creating new life forms, as a revolt against the sovereignty of God and an attempt to be God."
On the other side, biotechnology companies typically view patents as a life-or-death issue. Had it not been possible to patent human genes, they say, thousands of patients would already have been denied life-saving drugs.
A number of the religious leaders interviewed this week say that they are not opposing genetic engineering or biotechnology itself on religious grounds. Rather, they say they are opposed to the patenting of human genes or organisms. That, they say, violates the sanctity of human life and reduces what some call the "blueprint of evolution" to a marketable commodity.
But biotechnology companies respond that in practical terms, opposing patenting amounts to opposing genetic engineering. They say the patents -- which grant companies exclusive rights to manufacture or sell inventions for 17 years -- have been crucial to their ability to raise capital, because they assure that a company can earn a profit from its research.
Many of those participating in the campaign say they are also alarmed about future commercial prospects: companies that own the rights to a line of human blood cells, or to genes used in tests to detect breast cancer or to genes that could be inserted into human embryos to create "designer children."
"One of the basic principles of our church is that life is a gift from God," said Bishop Kenneth Carder, who is in charge of the United Methodist Church's task force on genetic science. "The patenting of life forms reduces life to its marketability. Gone is the fundamental principle that life is a gift that ought to be shared and nurtured."
Indeed, the breadth and depth of religious feeling on the issue are hard to overstate, and many religious leaders say they plan to encourage a broad education effort and ignite a long-term political campaign from within their churches and synagogues.
The new coalition was painfully stitched together over the last two years, largely with help from one of the biotechnology industry's most persistent adversaries: Jeremy Rifkin, head of the Foundation on Economic Trends in Washington. The foundation has fought biotechnology companies on scores of issues, from marketing milk produced by cows that receive a growth hormone to growing new plants that were developed through genetic engineering.
The Patent and Trademark Office has routinely awarded patents on human genes since 1980, when the Supreme Court ruled that the Exxon Corporation could patent a microorganism used to dissipate oil spills. The Government awarded the first animal patent in 1988, on a genetically modified mouse developed at Harvard University, and it has since issued eight other animal patents.
Nearly all of the successful new drugs produced through genetic engineering have been based on patented human genes, like the gene that produces human growth hormone or the genes that stimulate production of red blood cells. Human genes are also central to new "genetic therapies," in which patients with a genetic disease like cystic fibrosis are injected with healthy genes that reproduce inside the body.
"Some people mistakenly assume that breakthrough medical technologies will occur without patents, but they will not," said Lisa Raines, vice president for government affairs at the Genzyme Corporation in Cambridge, Mass., which is working on gene therapies for cystic fibrosis and also owns part of a company that is developing transgenic goats that produce valuable drugs in their milk.
Ms. Raines noted that biotechnology companies must raise tens of millions of dollars years before they have a marketable product, and patents provide the only assurance of being able to profit in the event that high-risk research is successful.
The strongly held -- and opposite -- views are likely to present the conservative Republican Congress a difficult choice between two constituencies that lawmakers passionately support: business and religion. While the religious groups plan to pursue educational campaigns, Mr. Rifkin has been laying the groundwork for a political assault, financed in part by church contributions.
Republican lawmakers moved aggressively during the first 100 days of Congress to remove what they viewed as impediments to business, from environmental regulations to product-liability lawsuits.
But conservative Christian denominations have provided a pillar of Republican support, and some of those same groups have signed up as opponents to the patenting of genes. Among them are the Southern Baptist Convention, the Assemblies of God and the Reform Church of America.
Bishop William Friend of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Northern Louisiana said that patenting human genes or genetically engineered animals was clearly at odds with the teachings of Pope John Paul II, who has already preached against practices including artificial insemination and in-vitro fertilization.
"Pope John Paul was clearest about this when he said that all activity, all interference in the genome, must absolutely respect the specific nature of the human species and the incomparable dignity of every human being," Bishop Friend said.
The biotechnology industry, he added, was looking at the issue from the standpoint of business and science. "You've got to realize that we are dealing in a larger context -- the sovereignty of God," the Bishop said. "We're calling for education on this topic. Decisions are being made, and people are garnishing rights without a public forum. I have a problem with that."
The debate is likely to become more complicated as technology advances. Most animal patents thus far have been for mice genetically engineered for use in medical research. The "Harvard mouse" was genetically engineered to develop cancer and is used in cancer research. Scios Nova Inc., a company in Mountain View, Calif., obtained a patent in February for mice that exhibit the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
But several companies are working on stranger projects. DNX Technologies of Princeton, N.J., has been trying to develop animals with human-like organs that can be transplanted to people.
Ms. Raines of Genzyme said the goal of all these efforts was profoundly moral. "The motivation of biotechnology is not to play God," she said. "It is to play doctor. Doing that requires that we learn about, and harness, the genes that God has placed in us, and to fix those that through an error of nature are not working properly. We believe those are appropriate goals and that they reflect our reverence for human life."

HEADLINE: Inflation Up, But Economy May Be Brake

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Inflation quickened last month as sharp increases for groceries and transportation pushed up the Consumer Price Index by four-tenths of 1 percent.
But even though the Government reported today that the rise in the index was the largest monthly increase since August, most economists said they were not alarmed because they believed that a slowing economy would help prevent any worrisome surge in prices. 
 "There's no kind of cohesive picture that inflation is picking up in any significant way," said Joel Popkin, a Washington consultant who was once an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the inflation figures.
Helping to defuse any worries over a rise in inflation was another report, which showed business inventories piling up amid lackluster consumer spending.
Financial markets, which have surged in recent months as evidence accumulated of a slowing economy that is likely to keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates further, reacted calmly to the Government's latest economic snapshots.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose to a new high, closing up 19.37 points to close at 4,430.56. [Page 37.]
The bond market, which is often shaken by even a whiff of inflation, was steady, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slipping to 6.99 percent, from 7 percent on Thursday. [Page 36.]
Despite the benign reaction, some analysts expressed concerns that inflation might continue to creep up, in part because the dollar's weakness this year against the Japanese yen and several European currencies could make certain goods more expensive.
With the cost of imports likely to be on the rise as Japanese and European auto makers attempt to make up for the squeeze on margins from the weaker dollar, domestic producers are also in a better position to increase their own prices. And new cars rose in price by six-tenths of 1 percent last month. Another possible sign was a surge in air fares and hotel rates, probably reflecting stepped-up foreign tourism, said Paul L. Kasriel, a top economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
But with demand for autos softening and the economy slowing, producers are likely to find it increasingly difficult to raise prices as consumers demand rebates and other bargains to be lured into buying.
Indeed, the Commerce Department, in its separate report today, said business inventories climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent in March, completing the biggest quarterly rise since the beginning of 1987. Sales, meanwhile, were unchanged.
Much of the rise in unsold retail goods, which rose four-tenths of 1 percent, reflected a 1.9 percent accumulation of cars and light trucks. Production plans have already been substantially curtailed this spring.
The Labor Department's price report contained some scattered evidence that pressures that had been building up at earlier stages of processing were now starting to hit consumers.
But most of the signs of higher prices are "really coming more from the service side," said Edward F. McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. Services, which account for nearly 57 percent of the price index, advanced four-tenths of 1 percent last month, twice the rise by commodities other than food and energy.
The consumer price increase, while not setting off many inflation alarms, nonetheless probably dashed any hopes that the Fed might move soon to relax monetary policy. Today's price report, Mr. McKelvey said, takes "that right off the table."
He predicted no change in the short-term interest rates controlled by the Fed at either the May 23 or July 5-6 meeting of the central bank's Open Market Committee.
For the first four months of the year, the core Consumer Price Index, -- which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors -- climbed at a 4.2 percent annual rate, compared with 2.6 percent for 1994.
Food and beverage prices jumped seven-tenths of 1 percent last month, with nearly all of the increase reflecting a huge 7.5 percent advance for fresh fruits and vegetables, according to the Labor Department's report. Lettuce, particularly hard hit by California floods, soared a record 113.1 percent.
Transportation costs also rose seven-tenths of 1 percent despite moderation in various items that accelerated earlier in the year. Automobile finance charges rose an additional 1.1 percent, airline fares climbed 3.4 percent to bring the four-month total to 10.6 percent and gasoline rose six-tenths of 1 percent. All prices are adjusted to reflect normal seasonal fluctuations.
But such troublesome spots as medical care, up three-tenths of 1 percent for the fourth straight month, and education, up two-tenths of 1 percent, were well behaved.
The rise in college tuition, Mr. Popkin, the Washington consultant, observed, has been more than 70 percent greater than the overall Consumer Price Index during the last decade but now shows clear signs of moderation. "College is becoming a very price-sensitive issue," he said.
The Consumer Price Index now stands at 151.9, meaning that an assortment of goods and services that cost $100 in 1982 now costs $151.90.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
It's Hard to Be Neutral About a Nuclear Dump

BYLINE: By Kirk Johnson 

DATELINE: SALEM , Conn.

 BODY:
NUCLEAR power is part of the rhythm of life around here, as the mills were once, and the farms before that.
 Jane Marolda's father poured concrete at the three Millstone nuclear reactors, eight miles away in Waterford. Hal Lewis, now retired, was an inspector there, or "snoopervisor," as he put it. Any fishermen worth knowing will tell you that the best place for bluefish is down where the warm water from the cooling towers spill into Long Island Sound. 
 Connecticut, in fact, relies more on nuclear energy than all but two states in the nation, according to the United States Department of Energy, and every last bit of it is in Salem's backyard: the state's four commercial nuclear reactors, built over the last 30 years, are clustered within 15 miles, along with a nuclear submarine shipyard and a major research lab for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals -- all big employers and big users of the atomic power.
 "If there was trouble, we'd be the first to know because half of Salem works there," said Mrs. Marolda, referring to the local nuclear plants. Her husband wears a radioactivity monitoring badge on his job too, as a diver working on the Navy's nuclear subs in Groton.
 But some people are now saying that Salem's easy familiarity with rads and rems has gone too far. Last month, the town became the first in the state to actually invite state officials to give a talk about placing a low-level nuclear waste dump within its borders.

A REQUEST for information does not mean a commitment, of course, or even a promise to formally consider playing host to the dump. But it has set off a debate of a peculiar and insular local variety. In a town of only 3,600 people where just about everyone seems to have a link to the technology of atomic fission, debating the question of a nuclear waste dump means debating a big part of Salem's identity and culture and economy.
 "I'm hoping it will facilitate understanding and willingness to listen," Frank P. Sroka, a member of Salem's governing body, the Board of Selectmen, said, referring to the long relationship between Salem and atomic energy. Mr. Sroka, an employee at Millstone, said he remains neutral on the dump plan, as his elected position requires, but wants a "full exchange of ideas."
 James S. Sipperly, an organizer of a group called Salem Against the Dump, said he believes neutrality on this issue is impossible. He said that some town residents who work at the nuclear plants are afraid to speak out against the idea for fear of losing their jobs. In the next breath, however, he said that Mr. Sroka, one of the people who did speak up, had a conflict of interest and should recuse himself.
 At Town Hall, officials said that calls and letters were running about 50-50 for and against the idea.
 Money is the state's big bait. Connecticut will pay $1 million a year for the next 50 years to the town that volunteers and is found suitable, and some residents in Salem, where last year's budget was about $8 million, said they believed that the state could be squeezed for more. Even opponents concede the town could use a boost. At the Salem Town Center, the closest thing to a downtown shopping strip, 10 of the 18 storefronts are vacant.
 "I say, bring it on," said Tom Howard, a truck driver who walked in for lunch on a recent afternoon at the Salem Country Store. "We need the money." Mr. Howard said that if you want to know what's really scary, talk to a truck driver about the hazardous substances that he said are rolling down the nation's highways right now. A dump, he argued, would at least be monitored and controlled.

MR. LEWIS, buying his lottery tickets, said the issue that would swing his decision was the "potency" or degree of radioactivity of the materials the state wants to store. Mrs. Marolda questioned whether the state would keep its promises if it came down to negotiating a deal.
 "In for a penny, then they take over," she said. "I'd rather have a nuclear plant than a dump."
 State officials swear that low-level nuclear waste does not include things like spent fuel rods or plutonium, but rather the humdrum detritus of the nuclear workplace: irradiated tools, for instance, and clothing. The State Waste Management Service's assistant manager, Anita Baxter, said that because so many people in Salem are familiar with radiation at exactly that kind of hands-on level, there is probably no place in Connecticut with a greater ability to weigh the risks rationally.
 Small-town politics can be risky enough. Ed Hobart, co-owner of Ed & Dawn's Country Deli, said he wouldn't have a problem with a well-run storage center. But in the interest of his cash flow he's decided to take no side at all when folks arrive for their morning coffee.
 "I tick people off enough just being myself," he said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Deal to Combine 2 Movie Theater Chains Is Called Off

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
The proposed merger between two leading theater chains, the Cineplex Odeon Corporation and Cinemark USA, has been called off, the companies announced yesterday.
The planned deal, which would have created the world's largest chain of movie theaters, fell apart because of a series of unforeseen changes in the world economy and shifts in corporate power, Wall Street analysts said. 
 Under the original proposal, Lee Roy Mitchell, the founder of Cinemark, was to control 23.2 percent of the new company, which was to have been named Cineplex International. In addition, MCA Inc., the parent company of Universal Pictures and Universal television, would have controlled an equal-sized stake.
But when the Seagram Company, the Montreal-based company controlled by the Bronfman family, purchased control of MCA last month, everything changed. The Bronfman family owns 26 percent of Cineplex, and, with the acquisition of MCA, would have ended up with control of the new movie theater chain.
"The Seagram acquisition of MCA would have changed the balance of power of the corporate board," said Harold Vogel, an entertainment industry analyst with Cowen & Company. "Cinemark management wanted more voting power than they would have ended up with."
The proposed deal also ran into several other problems. For example, analysts said, the industry's box-office receipts were unexpectedly weak in the most recent quarter. Also, Cinemark owns a number of theaters in Mexico, and the Mexican peso's severe decline played havoc with the numbers in some of the deal's financial agreements.
"A strong dollar against a weak peso does not make for strong earnings in Mexican theaters," Mr. Vogel said.
Still, the two companies have not ruled out future cooperative ventures. The companies said yesterday that in the next few months they planned to explore joint opportunities, "which may benefit both parties on a level much less ambitious than a full merger."
Shares of Cineplex Odeon closed at $2.125, unchanged on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
Cineplex Odeon, which is based in Toronto, has theaters in Canada and the United States, with a total of 1,625 screens. Cinemark, a privately held company based in Dallas, has 1,164 screens in the United States and Canada, 6 in Chile and 42 in Mexico. It was formed in 1984 by Mr. Mitchell and Paul Broadband, a real estate developer.

HEADLINE: A Rise in Consumer Prices Doesn't Faze Credit Market

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday as a Government report on consumer prices matched market expectations. Indeed, all the economic reports issued this week have produced a virtual standoff between good news and old worries, according to analysts.
The 30-year bond was up 3/32 , to a price of 10330/32 for a yield of 6.99 percent, down a basis point from the previous day. Shorter-maturity bill rates were up a bit, with a three-month maturity up four basis points, to 5.68 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 With the dollar up again yesterday, there was continued speculation that that foreign central banks were taking profits and selling the Treasury securities they bought in recent months to help support the dollar, and that weighed on prices throughout the day.
Still, traders say, the outlook remains favorable for a soft landing for the economy. Yesterday's inventory data, notably the decline in retail inventories, excluding autos, is viewed as refuting talk of collapsing retail sales and the threat of a recession. The Atlanta Federal Reserve index, a survey of regional business activity, was weak, even though the six-month outlook has improved.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, called the rise of four-tenths of a percent in the Consumer Price Index for April overdue, given the benign numbers in the index over the last six months. At the same time, he said, it is an overstatement of the trend rate of inflation, which irons out volatile swings in food and fuel prices and which stands at 3.1 percent measured year over year.
"Inflation is a lagging indicator," Mr. Fine said, "and the trend rate will continue to lift as the year progresses, but it is unlikely to become a threat or exceed the Fed's upper limit constraints."
The Fed is on hold right now, he said. "Second-quarter G.D.P. will be significantly weaker than the first," he added, "and will be evidenced by noticeable declines in both industrial production and capacity utilization when they are released on Tuesday.
"But what matters for both Fed policy and the bond market is how the economy performs in the second half. At the moment, a soft landing for the economy with the trend rate of economic growth moving toward 2.5 percent has a reasonably high probability, in which case Fed policy will likely remain unchanged for quite some time."
The market was also influenced yesterday by an unexpected decline in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, Mr. Fine said. "Consumer psychology isn't necessarily a leading indicator of consumer spending," he said. "There is no question that people tend to spend more when they feel better, but it is also true that people tend to feel better when they spend more."
In the municipal market, prices were steady amid signs of increased demand from small investors. With supply drying up, municipal securities are growing more attractive than Treasury bonds to many.
Yesterday the average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer's index of 40 municipal issues was up a basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point, to 6.20 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues Its Advance On Optimism Over U.S. Deficits

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar extended a rally yesterday as currency dealers grew optimistic that the United States would act to cut its budget and trade deficits.
 The dollar surged 1 percent against both the German mark and the Japanese yen yesterday. For the last three months, the dollar is down 12 percent against the yen and 4 percent against the mark. 
 "The dollar has been undervalued for most of this year," said Randolph Donney, director of capital market research at Pegasus Econometric Group in New York. "Now we've gotten some encouraging news and that's really helped boost the dollar."
 Demand for dollars accelerated Thursday after the House Budget Committee voted 24 to 17 for a balanced budget plan that would cut the size of the Federal Government, reduce social welfare programs and usher in a balanced budget within seven years. Late Thursday, the Senate Budget Committee approved a similar plan by a 12-to-10 vote.
 "The market has been reacting favorably" to the talk on the balanced budget, said John McCarthy, foreign exchange manager at ING Capital Markets Inc. in New York. "There is a lot of optimism that something good will come from this."
 The dollar rose as high as 1.4562 marks, its highest since March, before settling in New York at 1.4485, up from 1.4335 marks on Thursday. The dollar also touched a five-week high against the Japanese yen, hitting 87.05 yen. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 86.80 yen, up from 85.68 yen.
 The dollar, analysts said, was also supported this week by the Clinton Administration's tough stand against Japan's trade practices.
 On Wednesday, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, announced that the United States would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization in retaliation for what he called Japan's refusal to open its automotive market to America. Mr. Kantor also said the United States would soon publish a list of Japanese products that could be hit with punitive tariffs.
 "With the sanctions to come out soon, many people believe that we may see some results in lowering the trade deficit," Mr. Donney of Pegasus Econometric Group said.
 Japan's $66 billion trade surplus with the United States has been seen as a main cause of the dollar's decline because it insures a steady flow of dollars into the hands of Japanese exporters, who must exchange them for yen, flooding the foreign exchange market with dollars.

HEADLINE: The Damages Bill Is Veto Bait

 BODY:
To fix a legal system that is not broken, the Senate has passed what it calls the "Product Liability Fairness Act of 1995." It is a political victory for the manufacturers and trade associations after a decade of expensive lobbying. The bill would ease the burden on manufacturers and product sellers to pay punitive damages when juries find that their products flagrantly and even deliberately -- not just negligently -- injure their customers.
President Clinton, already on record as opposing ceilings on punitive damages, had better have his veto pen handy for its first use of his tenure. The House has passed a measure even more hostile to consumers, so the prospects are high that the two chambers will compromise on a bad bill. 
 Most states allow juries to assess punitive damages over and above the award that compensates victims of negligence for actual monetary expenses and pain and suffering. The higher damages are designed to punish wrongdoers for egregious misconduct, like the calculated decision to use cheap, faulty materials and designs for products or to leave faulty products on the market long after they were known to be unsafe. Punitive damages are also meant to deter further abuse by the same company or other companies that might be tempted toward similar callousness. Punitive awards help to police the marketplace and hold sellers to their claims that their products are safe.
The campaign against punitive damages is fueled by industry propaganda with its exaggerated claim that high awards by emotion-driven juries are damaging the economy and discouraging companies from developing innovative products. But punitive awards are actually rare. Nationwide there were 355 such awards between 1965 and 1990, one-quarter of them in asbestos cases. Extremely high awards are almost always reduced on appeal.
Piously citing the need for uniform national commercial standards, the House and Senate have set maximum punitive damages nationwide, overriding the product liability laws of every state that has unlimited punitives. But they impose no such damages on states that do not have them, an inconsistency that betrays their real priority, which is to provide maximum relief for corporate defendants. The Senate's arbitrary cap for punitives is $250,000 or, if greater, twice the sum of economic and pain-and-suffering damages.
Such caps serve neither justice nor uniformity. They free a large manufacturer to make calculated corner-cutting decisions knowing the risk of high civil judgments is minimal. Invoking the popular distrust of lawyers, the sponsors of caps would deprive citizens and their lawyers of the chance to recover large awards for gross negligence. That further liberates manufacturers by thinning the ranks of lawyers who are financially able and motivated to bring lawsuits.
Senators Slade Gorton and Jay Rockefeller, the principal sponsors of the limit on damages, have introduced a clause that would allow a trial judge to lift the ceiling on punitive damages in any case where the judge found the ceiling unjust. They claim this technical adjustment means, as Senator Rockefeller says, that "we have removed caps." That is nonsense, of course. They have simply fashioned a cumbersome and expensive post-trial procedure that will not help most plaintiffs. The only way to remove these caps is to delete them entirely. President Clinton should veto any bill that fails to do so.

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, Too, Neighborhoods See Real Estate Scare Tactics

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In your news article on how brokers have tried to pressure Queens residents to sell their homes (May 5), you address a growing problem that is more widespread than many suppose. Sadly, middle-class communities in Queens and the Bronx are not the only places where real estate agents use fear to sell homes. 
 Residents of several middle-class Brooklyn neighborhoods also complain about real estate agents who care little for community stability. The pressure has been especially intense in Canarsie and Flatlands. As in Queens, too many real estate agents create business by instilling a false sense of crisis.
I know this from experience. My parents own a small rowhouse in Flatlands. They are distressed at the number of their neighbors who have received calls from agents who declare that "things are going downhill fast," and "now is the time to sell."
Flatlands is a safe, attractive area of single-family homes and young families. Yet many blocks now have at least one "For Sale" sign on the lawn. The same is true for much of Canarsie.
Cathleen Nolan, president-elect of the Long Island Board of Realtors, asks for "proof that real estate agents are going around trying to scare people into selling their homes."
As residents of Flatlands know, most offending agents are too smart to leave a paper trail.
New York City will suffer if the agents in question continue to operate unchecked. Economic and social stability will collapse if middle-class residents are scared into fleeing. I hope that the problem gets attention from City Hall, and from Brooklyn officials like Councilman Herb Berman.

HEADLINE: Let Muslims in Europe Tell Their Own Story

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A May 6 news article on European Muslim immigrants stated that failure or success of European immigration policies "could have important lessons for the United States, with its own large, new Muslim presence." 
 While you identified the Muslim immigrants of Europe as North Africans in France, Bengals in Britain, Turks in Germany, you did not explain what this "new Muslim presence" in America means and which ethnic groups it involves.
The situation of Muslim immigrants in Europe is perhaps incomparable with that of Muslims in America, in the same way the colonial legacy of Europe has no equivalent in American history. Most North African immigrants did not invade France, but were shipped from North Africa to Parisian suburbs in the 1960's to fill jobs the French consider cheap and filthy.
Now that unemployment is rising among the French, Muslim immigrants are subject to political bargaining in which their voices are never heard. When they are not threatened with expulsion, they are asked to accept blindly the French policy of assimilation, which remains vague, hardly supported by concrete cultural and social projects.
Worse, to the French, their food is smelly, their languages are repulsive and their mosques harbor fundamentalists.
In America, food, language and worship are reflections of a multicultural society. I have not heard Americans complaining of Chinese, Indian and Caribbean food. Neither have I seen Americans repelled by signs in Chinese or Hebrew.
Had you included interviews with European Muslim immigrants, they might have outbalanced the racist statements by Europeans you interviewed.

HEADLINE: Two Year-Round Schools May Begin In September

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
This may be the last year of traditional summer vacations for some students in New York City schools as officials try to move the system into year-round schooling.
 For students at two schools, the change might come as early as the coming school year, said Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines, who would not name the schools. Three other schools will probably also be converted to year-round schooling in the summer of 1996, as part of a plan to alleviate severe overcrowding. 
 In January, Chancellor Cortines vowed to move fast to begin year-round schooling at a few schools, maybe as early as this summer.
 But yesterday, the Chancellor said that while he is no less convinced of the urgent need for year-round schooling, the city's bleak financial situation and the long planning time needed meant that a more realistic time frame for beginning a citywide program would be next year. He said yesterday that he would announce in September which schools would be the first on a year-round schedule.
 "Our enrollment growth continues unabated," Mr. Cortines said in a revised plan on overcrowding that was released yesterday.
 Mr. Cortines's enthusiasm for the idea came after a commission he appointed last year to study overcrowding, as well as City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, recommended that the Board of Education go to year-round schooling as one way to accommodate more students.
 Mr. Cortines's advisory group said that because of the increasing birth rate and immigration, by the year 2003, enrollment would climb by 250,000, to 1.2 million, a rate of growth Mr. Cortines compared to "a train roaring down the track."
 In year-round programs, students attend school 180 days, as they do now, but they have several shorter vacations rather than one long one in the summer. In Los Angeles, which has had year-round schooling since 1974, some schools divide students into four groups. At any one time, one group is on vacation.
 Ron Brady, assistant to the Chancellor, said that officials in one community school district, which he did not name, had expressed interest in beginning year-round schooling for the 1995-96 school year.
 "If individual parents and superintendents express a large interest in year-round, we're prepared to support them," he said. "The team that we've convened to implement this decided that it was too short of a time period to implement this in a comprehensive way, citywide, by next year."
 The Chancellor also said that school officials are working on several other fronts to create classroom space for 13,500 more students by the fall of 1996.
 "It is important to note that year-round education will not solve our overcrowding problem because it cannot be used system-wide," Mr. Cortines said in his most recent report.
 The use of portable classrooms was among the options presented that would provide the greatest number of extra seats -- 4,222.
 At some schools, students will begin the day at different times, allowing the schools to make better use of their buildings and other resources and creating 3,500 spaces.
 Also, the school system will be more creative in finding space to lease to accommodate overflow.
 The Chancellor said that in another effort, officials are working with state legislators to introduce a bill that would create a separate bonding authority for the city schools' capital projects. The school system is now dependent on the city for its capital budget, which includes construction of new schools. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposed budget for the coming year reduces the board's five-year capital budget by 23 percent. School officials have said that the $650 million reduction in their capital plan would halt the construction of new schools.
 Lillian Marti, who helped write one of the reports on overcrowding for the Chancellor's commission, said that Mr. Cortines seems to be moving as quickly as he can on the problem.
 "There simply is not much that can be done between now and the fall due to the economic crisis," she said. "This will take a lot of preparation time. It needs to be done in concert with parents because it is going to be disruptive.
 Mr. Cortines said that officials have identified more than 80 schools in the city that are air-conditioned and could be converted to year-round use.

HEADLINE: ENCOUNTERS;
When In Rome, Get A Haircut

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MEWSHAW; Michael Mewshaw, the author of "Ladies of the Court" (Crown), is finishing a novel set in Rome and Prague.

 BODY:
Having lived in Rome for a dozen years, I fly back once or twice annually and always go through the same rituals of readjustment. I slug down a cappuccino, I order a bowl of spaghetti con vongole -- and I have a haircut. This last act may seem strange, but in fact it signifies that I've truly returned. Rome is a city scaled to human dimensions and can only be summed up by a person. For me, that person is Sandra Kennedy, a hairdresser whose pluck, talent for improvisation, cleverness, self-deprecating humor, beauty and tensile strength are the embodiment of a metropolis that calls itself eternal, yet displays the frenetic energy of a fruit fly living only for the moment.
When I first met Sandra, almost 25 years ago, my hair was dense and dark, and I had sideburns down to my shoulder pads. A couple of times a year she clipped my mane. She also tended to the coiffeur of my wife, Linda, which in those days resembled Anouk Aimee's windblown look in the 60's romantic French film "A Man and a Woman." 
 After we had two sons, visits to Sandra's salon became a family affair. By then my locks were white and not nearly as thick, but Sandra looked after them with unfailing solicitude. I was always amazed by the grace with which she dealt with people who believed they never changed. In fact, it was she, always well groomed, working in stylish clothes -- no dowdy smocks for Sandra -- who remained unchanged. Moving from client to client, head to head, conversation to conversation, Sandra was, for my family, as for many others, a fixed point in our otherwise chaotic and kaleidoscopic Roman life.
That Sandra is a foreigner -- she immigrated to Italy from Australia more than 25 years ago -- does not render her a less representative figure. To the contrary. As with many of the world's capital cities, Rome is largely populated by people from other places, and be they from the provinces or from distant lands, the majority are passionate converts whose commitment to where they live exceeds the zeal of natives. Blond and blue-eyed, with an enameled exterior and a warm, caring heart, a lively wit and a perceptive take on people, Sandra chose Rome over London, Paris, New York and Los Angeles, and by that choice she defined the abiding appeal of the city in the very act of defining herself.
Trained as a high-fashion hairdresser, Sandra Kennedy left her hometown of Melbourne in the mid-60's and settled in London, which in those days was reputed to swing "like a pendulum do." It certainly swung for Sandra, who worked for Vogue and later for Vidal Sassoon; in the course of an average day she might be called on by Elizabeth Taylor for a comb out. But as Sandra explains, her deepest desire was "to live in a Latin country," and so in 1968 she moved to Rome, which at the time had become a center of high fashion and film making. Nicknamed Hollywood on the Tiber, the town teemed with movie stars, and Sandra found herself living the fantasy of those self-willed romantic women who run through English language fiction in a straight line from Henry James's Daisy Miller to Tennessee Williams's Mrs. Stone. She landed a few bit parts in movies and started a business in her home, where she did the hair of Clint Eastwood, Peter Finch, Peter Lawford, Vic Morrow and Carroll Baker. Eventually, after she managed to negotiate her path through the city's notorious red tape, she got a permit to open her own elegant salon on Via Barberini, near the end of Via Veneto, and the customers, including Gore Vidal, Joseph Losey and Morris West, kept coming.
But as close readers of novels set in Italy might have warned Sandra, the moral of most stories about foreigners, especially women, who are expatriates in Rome is that they wind up deluded, spiritually destroyed or dead. Sure enough, the blind forces of history, economics, politics and terrorism fell upon her. In the late 60's and early 70's, a series of labor disputes and national strikes immobilized the city, and customers couldn't reach Sandra's salon. The Red Brigades, a gang of urban guerrillas, began kneecapping, kidnapping and occasionally killing elected officials, and tourists stopped traveling to Rome. The dollar plunged in value against the lira, the cost of living soared, and movie companies decided it was too expensive and dangerous to film in Hollywood on the Tiber. Then Sandra's landlord announced that he wanted her to vacate the premises so that he could rent to a higher-paying tenant. He reiterated his demand in the time-honored local fashion by breaking into her shop in the middle of the night and smashing all her equipment.
FAINTER SOUL MIGHT have fled, but Sandra Kennedy wasn't about to be run out of town. Taking to heart the local aphorism, "Only for death is there no solution," she adapted to changing circumstances and started over. In a reflection of the demographic shift away from areas that used to signify la dolce vita, Sandra moved across town and opened a shop on the Via di Santa Cecilia in the ancient rione of Trastevere. Friends cautioned her that nobody who was anybody would come there. Far from the formally chic areas around Via Veneto, Trastevere -- literally "across the Tiber" -- was in those days a tough working-class neighborhood, suspicious of outsiders, staunchly Communist in politics and seedy and rakish, even if picturesque, in appearance. In its labyrinth of streets, laundry fluttered from overhead lines, housewives leaned out of windows walloping grit from carpets, old ladies watered the cobblestones in front of their apartments and boisterous boys kicked soccer balls.
In a painful early baptism by fire, Sandra was badly injured in the course of a purse snatching. Still, she stuck it out and dealt with the trouble on a personal basis, without calling in the police. This helped win the approval of the neighborhood. "The Italians came through for me," Sandra says. "They passed the word not to touch me and I was to be left alone." Eventually much of the neighborhood became gentrified and modestly well-off, and these days C.I.A. agents and N.P.R. reporters call Trastevere home.
It never hurt her, Sandra concedes, that she was blond and single. "Italians love women. They love to flatter them. Of course, it can get annoying. But as long as I smiled, and my smile had a sliver of ice in it, I was all right."
The key to survival and success, she acknowledges, was not just to learn the language, but to master the prevailing mores. "In the beginning it was my Anglo-Saxon mentality versus their Latin culture. I realize now sometimes I was wrong. I'd go to the bank, for instance, and they'd ask me to sit down and have a coffee. I'd get angry and say, 'I'm here to do business, not socialize.' Now I'm the one to offer coffee."
HAIRDRESSING FOR WOmen and haircutting for men are only a minor part of the services Sandra provides for a clientele that ranges over a broad spectrum representing every aspect of Roman life. True, she still deals with celebrities, movie stars, directors on location, a contingent of international journalists and television correspondents, and diplomats from every continent. But she also has plenty of Italian customers, including priests and nuns, and a pride of scholars from the American Academy comes down from its marble tower to have a trim, a tint or a touch-up and a quick fill of news and gossip. In recent years at Sandra's, I remember bumping into Gjertrude Schnackenberg, the famously beautiful poet. Her husband, the philosopher Robert Nozick, sat reading essays on the sublime while Gjertrude had her hair done. If I had ever had any doubts that this was an altogether different tonsorial establishment, that encounter ended them.
For reasons Sandra can't quite understand, many of her current Italian clients are teachers and psychiatrists. But then she herself has become proficient as a pedagogue and a therapist. "People bring me all sorts of problems," she says, and in this baroquely complicated city plagued by a byzantine bureaucracy, she often finds herself serving as a community liaison. "I remember the problems I had. So I'm happy to explain the system or introduce people to doctors or lawyers." (In my case, she kept an eye out for tennis players and arranged many a match for me.)
"The only thing I stay away from is real estate," she says. "The apartment situation here is impossible. Otherwise, I love Italy. It is my home. I can't think of living anywhere else. But remember, I'm living in the real Italy, not the fantasy."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Consolidators: A Fresh Look

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
CONSOLIDATORS are companies that sell, usually at a discount, the tickets that airlines fear they cannot sell at any advertised price. The airlines supply the tickets with the proviso that consolidators not advertise which airline will supply the seats.
Consolidators, or bucket shops, as they are called in Britain, deal almost entirely in overseas tickets. Many of them, including George Chen, president of C. L. Thomson Express, probably the largest in this country, began their businesses in ethnic communities in the United States where residents wanted to visit their countries of origin for reasonable fares.
The consolidator industry has had an uncertain reputation. The New York Metropolitan Better Business Bureau has kept an eye on it virtually since it sprang up, after the airline industry was deregulated in 1979. Two things have dropped a mantle of respectability on the business in recent months.
The first is that more travel agents are willing to deal with consolidators. Because major airlines now cap at $50 the 10 percent commissions they pay travel agents for domestic airline tickets, agents are looking for profit opportunities. One is to buy tickets at a cheaper price, which is the consolidator's stock in trade. The agent then marks up the tickets and resells them. The customer pays no more than before, perhaps even less, and the travel agent can still earn more than the airline's 10 percent.
A second change is on the horizon: nine big consolidators are organizing the Air Consolidation Association, a trade group that plans to set standards and police the industry.
 
One Passenger Saves $834
 A friend of mine who wanted to travel to London inexpensively contacted her travel agent, Joyce Palmer at Union Tours in New York. Ms. Palmer sold her a consolidator ticket on British Airways with a daytime departure on a Wednesday earlier this month. The ticket, which Ms. Palmer obtained through Travac, a consolidator, cost $450 plus airport taxes round trip, a saving of $168 over the $618 quoted by British Airways for a 21-day advance purchase economy ticket with a Wednesday morning departure. The price the airline would have charged her for the full economy ticket was $642 one way, plus taxes. She saved $834, taxes not counted.
My friend did not have to buy her ticket 21 days in advance, and this waived requirement for advance purchase, as well as for Saturday night stays, is a big part of the value of a consolidator ticket.
But there are drawbacks. If a flight is canceled, the ticket cannot be used on another airline. This may not be a problem if the line has many flights to the client's destination, but if there are only three flights a week, say, it may be. Frequent flier mileage is not usually given, although Ms. Palmer said that sometimes gate agents will punch the frequent flier number in for a traveler.
Other limits may apply: changes may cost $75 or be strictly curbed. British Airways, for example, will not give an advance seat assignment because seats for lower-priced tickets are limited.
Another problem is that tickets may be delivered quite late, but consolidators who have long-standing agreements with airlines may provide tickets well in advance.
 
An Unregulated Area
 The files in this department contain dismal tales of consolidators who have run off with the money. No one regulates them. One expert said that to set up as a consolidator, "all you need is a telephone and a fax." A dishonest operator can fax notice of a fictitious three-day fare sale to travel agents, with tickets to be delivered later. By the time the agents realize that the tickets are not coming, the phone is disconnected.
Airlines, the source of the tickets, try to provide consolidator tickets to companies that will not damage their reputations, but they cannot control a secondary consolidator who may buy from the original one, or several intermediaries.
Jax Fax, a monthly magazine that lists cheap fares and tours, is a principal resource for travel agencies; 28,000 of them subscribe to it. The June issue will contain 5,000 listings, a record number, paid for by the 125 consolidators offering them.
Clif Cooke, who has published Jax Fax from Darien, Conn., since 1973, says he drops three or four "listers" every month, either because they evoke complaints from travel agents or they fail to pay their Jax Fax bills. New advertisers fill out a "sort of credit rating form," Mr. Cooke said, and the total of 125 consolidators has been pretty stable. Last month, however, he rejected six new applicants, another record.
"The commission caps have kicked off a big desire on the part of quasi-businessmen to get into this area," he said. "There are a lot of slippery people out there. They start out as United Wonderful Travel, go out of business and reappear as Global Integrity Tours."
Unlike Jax Fax, which limits its circulation to travel agents, a new loose-leaf directory of consolidators is sold to both agents and consumers. According to Pamela Erwin, associate publisher, "Index to Air Travel Consolidators and Wholesalers" was first issued by Travel Publishing Inc. in 1993 and has been updated three times. The price of $49.50 plus $3.75 postage provides the basic book and a year of updated pages. In May the book listed 200 consolidators. There is no charge for the listings, which include names of airlines.
The book includes numerical ratings provided by some of the travel agents among the 2,000 to 3,000 subscribers reported by Ms. Erwin. If a dozen or so agents give a good rating, it is put on the sheet that gives details about the consolidator. Lower ratings are provided on separate rating sheets, which may be based on reports from fewer than three subscribers. Agents who give ratings feedback get a discount on subscriptions.
As a sample entry, the sheet on Travac says the company has annual sales of $25 million and uses British Airways, Delta, Air France, United, American, Continental, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines and Swissair. Travac gets a rating of 8.89 on a scale of 10. It accepts payments by Visa, Mastercard or travel agency check. Sindy Calay, a co-owner, said that the company could deliver tickets six weeks in advance, with overnight delivery costing $7 more. Ms. Calay said that Travac sold to the general public, but made 80 percent of its sales through travel agents.
For information about buying the directory: Travel Publishing, Norwest Center Skyway, 56 East Sixth Street, Suite 402, St. Paul, Minn. 55101; (612) 292-0325.
The Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York offers a helpful four-page fact sheet about consolidators, originally prepared in 1992 and sent on mail request. It also has two automated phone lines for learning about or lodging complaints.
If the call is made to (212) 533-6200, a charge of $3.80 will be put on the caller's credit card. A call to (900) 225-5222 costs 95 cents a minute, with an average call costing $3.80. This charge appears on the phone bill. A company's record is free on request from the Better Business Bureau, 257 Park Avenue South, New York, N.Y. 10010.

HEADLINE: San Miguel's Cosmopolitan Charm

BYLINE: By MARY CANTWELL; MARY CANTWELL is a member of the editorial board of The Times.

 BODY:
EVEN if I hadn't seen the sign I would have known this was the bus for San Miguel de Allende. In a sea of Mexicans stood a small island of gringos: an oldish couple wearing the kind of gear, and attitude, that proclaims Provincetown or Woodstock, several backpackers and two tall, stringy women in their 30's who, it turned out, would talk New York publishing nonstop while the rest of us attempted sleep. San Miguel, four hours north of Mexico City, is 75 percent Mexican but its air is that which is breathed in every arts colony in every part of the world. Here conversation is purer than it is elsewhere, having been filtered (at least for a while) of both commerce and critics.
The roadways are cobblestone and the sidewalks too narrow for two, and this New Year's Eve when I was in San Miguel and going to a party I was reminded of the movie "Don't Look Now." Slowed by high-heeled shoes, I couldn't keep up with my companion, who kept appearing and disappearing along the abruptly cornered, shadowed streets. Sometimes I glimpsed glories -- courtyards and fountains behind somber doors -- but mostly I walked through a darkness and secrecy that was far more Old World than New. 
 The pre-Hispanic population of San Miguel was nomadic, according to the town's visitor's guide, which costs about $15 and is worth it. Eventually it developed into small agricultural communities linked to two great metropolises, Teotihuacan and Tula, and fell to Cortes in the early 16th century.
Today it's a jumble of baroque churches and grand plazas; the rural poor and the Mexico City rich; tourists, mostly middle-aged Americans, who come for the sights, and tourists, mostly young Mexicans, who come for a weekend of dancing at Pancho and Lefty's, possibly the loudest disco on earth. There is also what the tourist guide calls a "new crossbreeding" of Mexicans and Americans who started arriving in the 1950's, whose lives are centered to some extent on the town's two distinguished art schools, Bellas Artes and Instituto Allende, and who are passionately interested in preserving its curiously cosmopolitan charm from halogen street lights, asphalt paving and suffocation by automobile exhaust. San Miguel is also a good place from which to mount an excursion. One can spend a day in any number of interesting towns and ruins and be back in time for a rather more worldly evening than is usually available in Mexico's central highlands.
The best way to see San Miguel is to walk its streets (although the town itself is beginning to sprawl, and its population has reached 110,000, its old center is compact), on all of which I managed to get lost -- mostly because I was forever detouring into a church, a shop or a marketplace. If I am unable to describe the altarpieces of any of the churches it is because they were, without exception, devoted to enormous Christmas creches, my favorite of which had a canvas backdrop painted with the fierce piety of a Giotto. Actually, fierce piety seemed the hallmark of all San Miguel's churches, that and an esthetic impulse that made a marvelously gaudy marriage of 18th-century stonework and 20th-century stars and tinsel.
At one church, Las Monjas, I walked in on a double wedding, sisters in white satin, one of whom was marrying a stiff, shy young man in a white shirt and white trousers, the other of whom was marrying a stiff, shy young man in a white shirt and black trousers. The two bridegrooms never cracked a smile, not even while being serenaded by a brass band or, with their male friends, climbing into the back of the pickup truck that was to take them to the reception. The brides, accompanied by their female friends, were in a separate pickup and grinning from ear to ear.
AT a second church, La Parroquia, on New Year's Eve, the town firefighters, were being celebrated with a procession and, again, a brass band. Brass bands are always within earshot in San Miguel, along with church bells and, on Sunday afternoons, political speeches so amplified as to pound every ear in town.
At the Sanctuary of Atotonilco, however, all is quiet, even desolate. The sanctuary is about nine miles outside San Miguel, but I recommend it for its remarkable frescoes, one chapel's stenciled lace walls, a Virgin Mary in full bridal fig and a life-size Christ in a glass case. His face is tortured, his back scourged, he is carrying the cross and he is wearing what looks like a pink macrame skirt edged with gold fringe. Touring churches can be a dull business, but never in Mexico. The images, however clumsy, have the force of a clenched fist.
Shopping is another of San Miguel's pleasures, even for someone like myself, who usually hates it. The area is known for its crafts, but don't bother looking for them up some obscure street in some obscure outlying village. The best of them are in town. My favorite shops were Zarco Artesanias; Veryka, where I bought a small, elaborately carved wooden church, and Izcuinapan San Miguel. I also liked the antiques shops and especially El Atico where, swamped in San Miguel's omnipresent sanctity, I succumbed to a framed print of the Nino de Atocha, a young prison visitor whose bread and water miraculously multiplied in the manner of the loaves and fishes.
San Miguel is hilly, so after a brisk walk through the Jardin Principal or the Parque Benito Juarez I'd catch my breath in the local library, which has a big, shady courtyard, or in the courtyard of Bellas Artes, where one can get a light lunch. I also stopped for coffee rather often, in little restaurants with irresistible patios, and once (for a margarita) in the pretty courtyard of the Hotel de Sierra Nevada, which is said to be the best in town.
A friend who lives in San Miguel also recommends the much cheaper Hotel Sautto, which gets a lot of art students and has a kitchenette in every room, and the Villa Santa Monica. Since I was staying in a private house I seldom dined out in San Miguel, but restaurants are easy to find. Many are advertised in Atencion, San Miguel's English-language newspaper, which, though lighter on local gossip than I would like, is heavy on local events.
Early one morning I took a bus through an arid, desertlike landscape (passing Dolores Hidalgo, a good place for tiles and old furniture, especially fanciful iron beds) to Guanajuato, the capital of the state of Guanajuato. Buses are cheap, and the most sensible way to get around this part of the world.
GUANAJUATO, in a silver-mining district, gave a lot of money to the Spanish crown during the 18th century. Judging by its great colonial buildings, it appears to have spent quite a bit on itself as well. But what I found most interesting about the city, which is also the site of a university, was its steep, sharply angled streets and huge, glass-roofed marketplace. Diego Rivera was born in Guanajuato, in a house that is now a museum. As a house it is boring, being clumsily renovated and dully furnished; as a record of his evolution as a painter it is fascinating, since it tracks Rivera from the time he was painting like virtually every other artist around to when, finally, he was painting only like himself. The state Museum of History and Archeology is fascinating, too, and presumably exhaustive, but I wished there, as I wished almost everywhere I went, that there had been more information about the exhibits and the city printed in English.
On the whole, though, it is a pity to stay indoors in Guanajuato, when there are all those narrow, vertiginous streets (reminiscent of Toledo and Lisbon's Alfama) to walk, and all those little plazas to sit in. Most of my sitting was done at the sidewalk cafe at the Hotel Museo Posada de Santa Fe, the home of the Prussian consulate during the reign of the unfortunate Maximilian. It faces a park with a charming Edwardian bandstand, is just down the street from the Juarez Theater, which would have done well as the set for the opening of "The Age of Innocence," and is within strolling distance of most of the best of Guanajuato.
Guanajuato is one bus trip to the north of San Miguel. Patzcuaro, which is about 100 miles to the southwest, takes three buses and is something else entirely. Where the faces are Spanish in Guanajuato, they are Indian in Patzcuaro, and on Fridays Tarascan Indians sell their pottery in the Plaza Vasco de Quiroga. Even so, the town itself evokes the Europe of 150 or so years ago. One can imagine Emma Bovary immured there, in one of its shuttered, secretive houses, running up a bill at the local dressmaker's and restlessly pacing its shaded squares.
Go up any street -- Patzcuaro is hilly -- and you will arrive at the Basilica, across from which is the Hotel Posada de la Basilica. My room had flowers painted on its white stucco walls, a balcony, and a much-needed fireplace (the nights are chilly) wedged in one corner. The view from the terrace was spectacular: the town tumbled at one's feet, and off to the right was a lake over which hovered a strange persistent mist and out of which come the tiny silver fish one sees for sale all over town.
Patzcuaro is known for its crafts, but nothing I saw in the shops, many of which are housed in a haunting, quite beautiful old convent and hospital near the Basilica, compared with the displays in the Museum of Popular Art. It is as charming a provincial museum as I have ever seen, and disarmingly homey.
A resident of San Miguel who is forever fantasizing about real estate says she would love to have a house in Patzcuaro. But who, she asks rhetorically, would ever visit her in so remote a spot?
I would, in a minute, and this time I would take the boat across that mysteriously misted lake to its largest island, Janitzco. I would also return to the restaurant facing the Plaza Vasco de Quiroga where I had smoked trout, and the little shop nearby where I bought an embroidered tablecloth and napkins. And I would do it just as I did in January: in buses that took me through a countryside whose beauty is rooted in its bleakness.
 
 
 
Shopping, eating, hotels and side trips
Getting There
 Buses to San Miguel de Allende from Mexico City leave from the northern bus terminal. E.T.N., Primera Plus, Flecha Amarilla and Heradura de Plata all have service between Mexico City and San Miguel. Prices range from $13 on E.T.N. (executive service) to $7.40 on Flecha Amarilla (second class). A direct trip takes about four and a half hours.
Buses that run from Guanajuato to Dolores Hidalgo can drop off passengers near the sanctuary of Atotonilco, on Route 51 about nine miles north of San Miguel; be sure to tell the driver you are going there. Buses leave for Dolores Hidalgo about every half hour from San Miguel's main bus terminal. Price: $1.75. The sanctuary is open from 7 A.M. to noon and from 4 P.M. to 8:30.
The trip from San Miguel to Guanajuato takes about an hour and 15 minutes. San Miguel's bus station sits about one mile outside town on the Calzada de la Estacion. Primera Plus has service twice daily for 18 pesos, and Flecha Amarilla has second-class service about every two hours from 6:45 A.M. to 5:00 P.M for 14.50 pesos. Telephone for both services: (465) 200-84. (The country code for Mexico is 52.)
There are several ways to make the bus trip from San Miguel to Patzcuaro, all involving multiple transfers.

Paying in pesos
 Figuring the consequences of a currency devaluation is a complicated business, but the bottom line in Mexico is that five months after the peso lost more than 40 percent of its value, converting dollars to pesos still generally benefits travelers. The advantages are fewer in cities and major resorts that are pegged to the dollar. Big hotels setrates in dollars, so no saving there.
In early May, the exchange rate stood at about 5.8 pesos to the dollar, meaning that whatever costs 1 peso in Mexico -- like a box of Chiclets -- costs a traveler about 17 cents, versus 29 cents before devaluation.
The advantages are tempered by inflation that could top 50 percent this year, along with a jump in the national value-added sales tax from 10 to 15 percent. Gasoline prices have shot up almost 40 percent. Even tortillas cost about 25 percent more now than they did in December.

2 New Projects Enhance a South Norwalk Recovery

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: NORWALK

 BODY:
TWO new projects costing a total of $6 million are scheduled to open in South Norwalk in July, signaling a recovery from four years of recession-hobbled growth in an area the city has counted on to seed future development and spark tourism.
In an effort to assure the recovery, Mayor Frank Esposito is now trying to rid adjacent neighborhoods of drug dealing, panhandling and prostitution. 
 The projects are the Crown SoNo Regent, an eight-screen, $4 million movie theater under construction on Main Street, and the New England Brewery, a $2 million microbrewery and 180-seat restaurant that will open half a block away on Marshall Street.
Daniel M. Crown, president of Crown Theaters, said he would move his headquarters from Manhattan into the theater building, while maintaining his present office. He added that the bulk of his theater operations would be brought to Norwalk. The theater is expected to draw patrons from New Canaan, Darien and Westport, fueling business for South Norwalk's shops and restaurants.
Valus & Carpenter Associates, Westport architects, have designed the 50,000-square-foot theater, conforming to the city's request that it reflect the area's prevailing Victorian architectural style. Some 5,500 feet of retail space will occupy the ground floor.
Crown, which owns and operates 10 theaters in New York and Connecticut, has an application pending for a six-screen theater in Norwalk on Route 1 at the Westport line.
The pub-microbrewery, local manifestation of a nationwide appetite for such establishments, is being converted from what was once a decrepit, vacant warehouse. Marcia and Richard King, the owners, have moved their brewery on Commerce Street to the new location after two years of renovations paid for with their own money. "We took no loans," said Mrs. King.
In 1993, they won a gold medal at Denver's National Great American Beer Festival for their signature product, Atlantic Amber. Seeking to provide equally good food, the Kings have hired Joseph Cizynski, former chef-owner of Le Bec Fin in Greenwich, as their chef.
Adding to the climate of improvement is the imminent restoration of the city's premier eyesore -- the vacant, deteriorated old City Hall, across the street from the movie theater. In foreclosure after a failed attempt to turn it into an inn, it is to be resurrected at a cost of $1.5 million as the Museum of Norwalk.
The architectural firm of Beinfield Wagner Associates formed a private partnership with other investors to buy the 15,000-square-foot building for $248,000. In addition to the museum, it is to contain a 3,000 square foot ballroom for weddings and bar mitzvahs, and 5,000 square feet of commercial rental space.
The three buildings complete a circle of diversions that will be marketed as a walking tour starting at the Maritime Center on North Water Street, where cruise boats are available for tours of the Norwalk Islands. Visitors will be able to walk to Marshall Street, to Main Street and on to the shops and restaurants of Washington Street and back to the Maritime Center.
AFTER a rocky start in 1988, the Maritime Center has succeeded to the point where it is one of Connecticut's major regional tourist attractions. It is now planning a $2.4 million expansion.
Washington Street is the heart of the SoNo (South Norwalk) Historic District. Carved out of the depressed south end of the city in the early 80's, it is considered a model restoration of 19th century brick buildings. But the recession left many stores vacant, condominiums unsold and the developer, Arthur Collins Enterprises of Greenwich, in bankruptcy. A reorganization plan for the company is under review in Federal Court in Bridgeport.
Today most of the condominiums are rented and there are few retail vacancies. But the mix of businesses is changing. Out of the 27 stores that the Collins company owns, 12 are restaurants, and most of the original upscale art galleries, craft shops and boutiques are gone.
"Some businesses came in without a lot of experience, committed to rents they couldn't afford," said Mr. Collins. Rents have been lowered and tenants, once carefully screened for esthetic rather than fiscal qualifications, are signed up to meet an economic need rather than enhance a concept. A general store, dress shop and shoe store are among the new tenants. paying rents around $12 to $16.50 a square foot, according to Bardwell Jones of Avery-Emerson Realty.
Residential condominium rentals range from $750 for efficiencies to $1,000 for 2-bedroom, 2-bath units with fireplaces, decks and water views. "Some are leased for only six months," said Patsy Brescia, broker with William Pitt, "while owners wait for buyers."
Even though condominium resale prices are down to a range of $40,000 to $100,000 from highs of $60,000 to $140,000, they are not moving, said Kate Johnson of the William Raveis Real Estate office here.
The Brookfield Craft Center moved out of its Washington Street branch last summer, retreating to its headquarters buildings in the Town of Brookfield that were built in 1790.
"Our 10-year lease was up," said John I. Russell, the executive director, "and our income wasn't enough to meet the $10-a-foot rent we were paying. When we opened in SoNo our goal was to help generate an arts-driven neighborhood, but over the years the arts component declined."
MICHAEL NISCHAN, owner of Miche Mache, an upscale French restaurant that was situated at the edge of SoNo on South Main Street, moved to Stamford a year ago for a reason that has plagued SoNo since its inception.
"Our customers were constantly being harrassed at night by panhandlers who demanded $5 in the free parking lot," he said. "Some of them would walk into the restaurant trying to sell stolen goods, or urinate on our windows. When our sous chef was held up at gunpoint while emptying some garbage out back, that was the last straw."
Drug-dealing, prostitution and petty crime in the adjacent neighborhoods are persistent concerns and a deterrent for tourists who come to the area by train and must walk through three blocks of urban decay before reaching SoNo and the Maritime Center.
According to Mayor Esposito, police schedules are being reviewed and altered to include night patrols that he hopes will eliminate complaints like Mr. Nischan's. He also said that he expected that the rehabilitation of the notorious New City Hotel opposite the Miche Mache site would remove a prime source of crime.
An additional measure to attract tourists, said the Mayor, is "the cleaning up of the Monroe Street area." A renovation of the entire neighborhood between the railroad station on Monroe Street and along South Main Street into SoNo is now under way. The city plans to float $1.5 million in bonds to buy the mostly vacant and substandard properties along the route, which it hopes to then sell to developers.
"We would like to see a combination of housing and retail extending from SoNo to the station," said Mayor Esposito.
The westbound side of a new $8 million station -- the eastbound side was completed last year -- and its 725-car parking structure are due for completion in October. The eastbound station house contains a police substation serving the surrounding unstable neighborhoods.
"SoNo is still a bit fragile," said Brechin Morgan, artist and owner of the Morgan Sign Company, a business that has survived in SoNo since 1976.
"Artists are often the vanguard of development," said Mr. Russell of the Brookield Craft Center, "but they can rarely afford the rent to remain as senior citizens when the area prospers."

HEADLINE: Where Have All The Doctors Gone?

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
FOR Loretta Cullen of Waterford, who has been hospitalized many times over the past few years, finding a doctor proved to be almost as big a challenge as her illnesses.
"A patient's problem is not just with the insurance companies. It starts with finding a doctor, period," Ms. Cullen wrote recently in a letter to a newspaper. "Our community has too few physicians, and all are overbooked or not taking new patients. If you're fortunate enough to receive an appointment, it will be for a month or two later, even though your problem is now." 
 New London County will need as many as 100 more primary-care physicians -- family doctors, internists and pediatricians -- by the turn of the century, according to the New London County Health Care Task Force. In fact, the shortage of primary-care physicians is among the most serious health issues facing the region, the task force stated in a report last year.
Several factors combined have created a greater demand for primary care, doctors in New London County said. Managed-care plans, which control the delivery of health services and the amount of reimbursement, require patients to see a primary-care physician before going to a specialist, since a primary-care physician's fee is lower. In addition, newly trained doctors seeking the advantages of joining a group practice are bypassing New London County, where doctors traditionally have worked alone or with a partner, and fees and insurance reimbursements are lower than they are in other parts of the state.
The great majority of primary-care practices are closed to new patients, the president of the New London County Medical Association, Dr. Robert J. Keltner, said. Dr. Keltner is a lung specialist who also received training in internal medicine. "About 10 percent of my patients don't have respiratory problems," he said. "I treat them for hypertension, diabetes and cardiac disease. They can't find another doctor who can take on their care. It's a real, day-to-day problem. I probably don't treat people as well as an internist would."
Besieged by increasingly complex insurance plans and government regulations, physicians find time constraints tighter than ever, Dr. Robert J. Bundy, who has offices in Willimantic and Norwich, said. "I don't think it's a matter of doctors turning patients away. Their practices are full," Dr. Bundy said. "For them to take on new patients is an excess burden. It just doesn't pay anymore."
Thirty-six out of an estimated 150 primary-care physicians are accepting new patients, the director of the New London County Medical Association, Amy Snider, said. Ms. Snider added that there may be some open practices not listed with the association. The shortage in New London County reflects a national trend, according to figures from the American Medical Association. Over the last eight years, the number of family physicians and general practitioners in the United States has grown more slowly than the groups of internists, pediatricians and obstetrician-gynecologists. The largest increase was in the number of internists, which jumped by 24 percent.
Dr. Louis Buckley, vice chairman of the department of medicine at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in New London, said the shortage is an artificial situation created by managed care. "They want everybody to turn to primary care first," Dr. Buckley said. "There are plenty of doctors around."
Managed care will fail when people realize it limits their ability to choose the physicians they want, Dr. Buckley said. He added that managed care is expensive to operate. "We need to do something simpler, like rationing some care. We have to become more realistic about dying."
A bill before the state Legislature would designate obstetricians and gynecologists as primary-care physicians under managed care plans. Representative Lenny Winkler, a Republican of Groton, who sponsored the bill, charged that the state is attempting to set up a Medicaid managed-care system, which would leave 200,000 people uninsured.
"Without the designation, we fall short of the number of primary-care doctors we need," Ms. Winkler said. Opponents of the bill argue that obstetrician-gynecologists are not trained to treat the variety of medical problems handled by primary-care physicians.
Local health professionals are working on ways to attract more primary-care physicians to New London County. They are seeking Federal and state funds to establish an Area Health Education Center, defined as a partnership between community health services and the University of Connecticut's medical school in Farmington. Under the plan, medical students, residents and students in other health professions would practice in the community under the supervision of established physicians, said Marta Medaris Smith, director of the Area Health Education Center Development Office in Norwich. "The center is a bridge between the private practice and academic programs," Ms. Smith added.
Scheduled for completion within the next three years, the center would encourage physicians to enter primary care and offer opportunities for medical training, Ms. Smith said. In addition, newly trained physicians would be available to fill in for local practitioners who need time off. Included in the plan are housing for medical students and residents and library resources.
Area health education centers were conceived by the Federal Government in the early 1970's and are operating in 35 states, Ms. Smith said. North Carolina's nine centers, for example, are affiliated with the state's four university medical schools. Students in medicine, dentistry, nursing, public health, pharmacy and other areas receive part of their training in local hospitals, physicians' offices and public health departments.
North Carolina's centers were started in 1972 with Federal funding but have been supported since 1974 with money from state and local budgets. The centers have built up the supply of primary-care physicians in the state, according to the program's administrative office in Chapel Hill. Since 1977, 61 percent of the family practice residents trained at the centers have remained in North Carolina. Nearly half the residents who set up practices in the state settled in towns with populations under 10,000.
Dr. Keltner said New London County, economically depressed, has less to offer young physicians. "Doctors coming out of school with a lot of debts may earn $40,000 to $50,000 less here than they would anywhere else," he said. It is hard to compete with big health maintenance organizations, which offer better salaries and benefits, he said.
And Dr. Keltner was not optimistic about the economic future. "Everybody sees more and more jobs lost," he said. "There may also be a shortage of patients who are well insured. Things are not that rosy."

HEADLINE: A Growing Taste for the Fruit of the Vinyl

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
FOR most of the quarter century that it has been on the market vinyl siding got no respect. While less tinny and more damage-resistant than aluminum siding, it served the same purpose -- covering unsightly, low- to mid-priced older homes.
But in the last five years it has become something of a Cinderella of the siding industry, swept from its humble beginnings by consumer demand for maintenance-free living. Manufacturers have created an ever-widening variety of sidings and trims in period and contemporary styles. And vinyl, once synonymous with modest homes, is increasingly being used in upscale housing, even for homes with price tags over $1 million. 
 "Vinyl has become the product of choice," said Lisa Macchi, district manager in the new homes division of Coldwell Banker Schlott in New Jersey. "It's a maintenance issue. We carry 150 new home projects in the tri-state area, in price ranges from $150,000 to $2 million, and its not the building community choosing vinyl for economic reasons, its a customer-driven success."
"People today," she added, "don't have the time to paint their houses as they did generations ago and they don't want the constantly escalating expense of repainting every few years, whether it's a new house or a resale."
Still, caution is the watchword when dealing with home buyers, according to some brokers.
"I don't tell people that a house is sided in vinyl at first," said Ron Molloy, an agent with Coldwell Banker Schlott in Greenwich, Conn. "Once they have fallen in love with the house and I do tell them, it doesn't matter."
Vera Blendermann, manager of Houlihan/Lawrence Real Estate in Bronxville, N.Y., said that "it's still not people's favorite thing."
"The size and location sets the price," she said, "but if the house has everything else they want, they overlook the vinyl."
An environmental measure that inadvertently boosted vinyl's popularity occurred in 1979, when the Federal Consumer Products Safety Commission ordered the removal of lead from all over-the-counter paints, and followed that action by removing mercury in 1990.
Lead in amounts up to 50 percent at the turn of the century had been reduced to 30 percent in the 40's and .05 percent in the 60's, but even the smaller amounts, combined with other additives, made paint nicely opaque, completely covering and clinging to the surface. Mercury, in proportions of around 200 parts per million, helped to prevent mildewing of surfaces and deterioration of paint in the can.
After the two elements were removed, painted houses began to deteriorate faster, emphasizing vinyl's most touted advantage -- the saving of many thousands of dollars for frequent repainting, stripping or sandblasting wood houses.
Homes that are finished with the better grades of vinyl are almost impossible to distinguish from the real thing -- various wood finishes and cuts. Vinyl can be molded to look like custom-milled clapboards, shiplap, cedar shakes, pediments, trellises, columns, railings, beading, Victorian and Carpenter Gothic decorative work, shutters and window and door frames.
Research by Alcoa, a major producer of vinyl building products, indicates that 53 percent of the homes using vinyl siding throughout the country today are priced from $100,000 up, an 11 percent increase from 1990. In addition, 48 percent of all re-siding in 1994 was done with vinyl. Plywood is next in popularity with 13 percent.
Vinyl's ability to withstand extreme climatic conditions for decades, and the fact that it is manufactured and delivered to the builder's exact specifications -- no warps, no knots, no surprises -- have made it the first choice of many developers.
"Every house we build is 100 percent vinyl or vinyl combined with brick or stone," said Robert Allen, senior vice president of Beazer Homes, based in Atlanta. In the company's subdivisions of 60 to 300 homes in several states, warranties of 50 years are offered on 1,200- to 4,500-square-foot houses priced from $100,000 to $300,000.
Jon Fleming, a partner in Vinylume, a family-owned business in Greenwich, has been working with vinyl since 1968. To date the company has vinyl-sided about 1,050 renovated or new Greenwich homes, and hundreds more in southwestern Connecticut and Westchester County. "We do 150 to 175 houses a year, primarily as an alternative to painting," said Mr. Fleming, "or to alter the style of a house," a project that can be prohibitively expensive in wood. "Vinyl accessories," he said, "produce excellent results in transforming a ranch into a colonial, or a colonial into a Greek Revival."
Libby and Thomas Hollahan chose vinyl for another reason. They bought their 1929 home in White Plains four years ago and last fall decided to have it painted. "There was a very high lead content in the existing paint," said Mrs. Hollahan, "and when we looked at vinyl siding as an alternative it turned out to be the most cost effective way of taking care of lead abatement."
The New York State Health Department agrees that vinyl can be useful in solving a lead problem. "Peeling paint should be removed," said Thomas Carroll, the department's senior sanitarian. "Then, as long as the siding is done properly, covering everything, any paint that falls off will be sealed inside, causing no harm."
The cost of sanding and repainting over old lead-based paint on a typical four-bedroom, two-story colonial of 3,000 square feet is around $12,000. Stripping down to the wood, priming, repainting and disposing of the lead debris in a toxic waste dump can be two to two and one-half times the $18,000 cost of vinyl siding.
But that does not mean that vinyl will never need painting. "All vinyl siding is expected to weather," said Kim Lenz, spokeswoman for Alcoa. So-called limited lifetime guarantees cover the siding itself, particularly the better Alcoa grades that are between .044 and .048 inches thick. They are guaranteed not to wave or bow, while thicknesses of .040 to .043 might. Certainteed, of Valley Forge, Pa., produces vinyls of .040 to .044 that it says will not bow. The minimum standard for the industry, set by the American Society for Testing and Materials, in Philadelphia, is .035 inches. .
Various manufacturer's warranties against fading expire between 5 and 10 years. Anyone planning to add to a vinyl house had better do it before the sixth year or be prepared to paint, because the addition will not match the original color.
Vinyl colors last years longer than paint because the color permeates the material and higher-quality vinyls retain deep tones longer than cheaper grades. "Scratches are not noticeable," said Rich Gottwald, technical director of the Vinyl Siding Institute in Bowie, Md.. "It's impervious to termites and manufactured with weep holes that allow the house to breathe. It can be cleaned with a garden hose and a household detergent. Damaged sections can be replaced and it flexes back to normal after being hit."
In response to consumer requests, Carl Minchew, chief chemist at the Benjamin Moore Paint Company in Montvale, N.J., has been developing paints specifically to remedy vinyl's fading and chalking. A product called Moore's Acrylic Latex Siding Paint is being test-marketed in the New York City and Chicago areas in white. Local dealers can produce any color by adding some of the 2,000 compatible tints.
"Vinyl is a great surface to paint on," said Mr. Minchew, noting that he preferred it to moisture-absorbing wood. "Latex is better than oil because mildew's favorite diet is the linseed in oil paint, and an arsenal of mildicides and additives is available to inhibit mildew, which affects all materials."
"Chalking," he explained, "occurs when the resin that holds vinyl together erodes and air enters, much like snow, which is clear water until it's turned white by air."
Another environmental measure that increased vinyl's desirability went into effect in 1989, when Federal restrictions on logging in 12 Western states were imposed to protect the spotted owl, salmon, grizzly bear and other endangered species. Wood became more expensive and less available.
Peak lumber production in 1987, according to the Western Wood Products Association in Portland, Ore., was 23.9 billion board feet. It dropped to 17.4 billion board feet in 1994, a 27 percent reduction.
"Twenty years ago we didn't use vinyl," said Mr. Allen of Beazer Homes. "We used wood, but warranty problems became atrocious and kept increasing."
DAVID MACKES, a custom builder of homes priced from $175,000 to $1.5 million in Salisbury, Md., complains that "there is less old-growth timber.
"What we are getting has a higher moisture content," he said, "so it tends to twist and have more nail pops." He said that rejections of shipments and parts of shipments were becoming more common.
But Jeff Santozzi, spokesman for the Western Wood Products Association, called such complaints exaggerated.
"Wood has its own characteristics," he said. "It's a natural product; that's what people like about it."
Research on pricing of vinyl compared with other materials was undertaken by Alcoa in 1994. The resulting figures showed that a square foot of installed, regular grade vinyl was about $1.45 compared with $2, $3 and $3.50 a square foot for pine, cedar and stucco, respectively, and $6.75 for brick. Top of the line vinyls cost no less than high-grade cedar, but labor costs are considerably lower for installing vinyl and it requires no initial painting or staining.
Many architects whose clients insist on using it have found the experience to be gratifying, but many others won't even consider it. Alan Shope, for example, of Shope Reno Wharton Associates, Greenwich architects, said: "I have designed large homes from Maine to Florida. People have asked for vinyl and we have said no. I'm not comfortable with fake plastic material. You can't beat tried and true wood shingles and stone. And I don't like the ticking sound that vinyl emanates in the sun."
As a self-described "lover of lead paint," he found ways of circumventing problems of mildew and peeling paint exacerbated by the absence of lead and mercury. He uses stains rather than paint, dipping the shingles in a preservative and weathering oil, covering all four surfaces with stain and sealing the ends -- "where most moisture accumulates," he said. He said that the treatment would last for 10 years.
In spite of such resistance, vinyl statistics are continuing to be pumped upwards by people who spend anywhere from $70,000 to $3 million or more on their houses. "In 1987 the United States produced 15.6 million squares, or 100 square-foot units, of vinyl," said Mr. Gottwald. "In 1993 we produced 24.2 million squares."
"Since the beginning of the 90's our business has grown by 35 percent," said Robert Long, marketing manager for Certainteed, which manufactures vinyl products at 100 sites around the country.
Melissa Keenan, architect for Megill Construction, custom builders in West Chester, Pa., used Certainteed materials in a $1.2 million, 4,000-square-foot, vinyl-sided summer home for her boss, Wayne Megill. It overlooks the ocean at Sea Isle City, N.J. "The third summer is coming up and it looks as good as new," said Mr. Megill. "With cedar I would have had to repaint at least once."
"On the shore a cedar house discolors badly within three years and the grout on a brick house comes apart," said Ms. Keenan. As recent converts to vinyl, the Megill company now uses it for 20 percent of its homes, occasionally running into resistance by local architectural review boards. "Vinyl has a long way to go with some of the people sitting on these boards," said Ms. Keenan.
Not all municipalities have architectural review boards, and not all that do maintain total oversight on the use of vinyl siding. In Greenwich, "it's not encouraged," said James Sandy, the Town Planner, "but the board doesn't get into reviewing single family homes." But in Bellport, L.I., "the architectural review board discusses every house, and it will allow vinyl siding only if it is satisfied with the detail and quality of construction," said Robert A. W. Heins, a local architect who has designed vinyl homes priced up to $3 million.
Vinyl is even gaining limited acceptance in historic preservation. The Vinyl Siding Institute and the Preservation Assistance Division of the National Park Service in Washington have been working together for some time on appropriateness and specifications for vinyl on historic renovations. The Park Service designates historic landmark buildings nationwide and acts as an advisory and technical assistance agency to local historic preservation organizations.
"We are in the business of retaining the historic character of buildings through repairing and reproducing elements of the original structure," said Kay Weeks, technical writer and editor for the division. "Although we would never recommend synthetic materials, under very special circumstances they can be used, to replace extremely deteriorated wood, for example, on a building that needs to be maintenance-free." A detailed set of 10 standards for architectural preservation is available through her department. "If there is a Federal tax incentive for rehabilitating a historic building and the criteria are not met," she said, "the tax credit will be withdrawn."
No legal action can be taken against people who destroy the architectural integrity of a building in violation of guidelines set by local historical societies or the Federal Government. But public pressure to preserve significant architecture usually prevails.
LIKE the National Parks Service, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission generally will not approve the use of vinyl siding on principal visible facades of historic buildings, said Deborah Sacks, spokeswoman for the commission. "But there are some exceptions," she said.
In St. George, on Staten Island, there were houses that already had vinyl siding before the area was designated a historic district. "We did not require its removal," she said. The same situation was found in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and handled in the same way. "We look at each case individually," said Ms. Sacks. "If vinyl siding is to be used on the back of a historic house, where it can't be seen, and it would alleviate a mildew problem, we may make an exception."
A few years ago, before building a large waterfront home in Annapolis, Md., Katherine and Michael Stalker attended a vinyl seminar, seeking a more satisfactory material than cedar. "We had watched very expensive three-year-old wood houses turn green and brown from moisture," said Mrs. Stalker, "and the bills for repainting were astronomical. A house of 7,000 square feet can cost $30,000."
Drawing on information from the seminar they chose a Wolverine vinyl for their $1.5 million house, completed in 1989 and still "looking fabulous," said Mrs. Stalker, "and we didn't cut down trees or dump paint residues into the water table." To maintain the siding they have it power-washed once in a while for $300.
"Some people," she said, "have difficulty in making the jump from wood to vinyl, but in another 15 years I think that they are going to turn up their noses at wood the way they do now at vinyl."

CONGRESS
Budget-Cutters on the March
Like it or not, Congress is inching steadily closer to dismantling Government as we know it. When House and Senate budget panels approved plans last week to balance the budget in seven years, the main sticking point was tax cuts -- the House wants $350 billion in cuts, the Senate none. They'll have to hash that out if, as expected, the bills pass this week. But then would come the messy part: figuring out specific cuts, not just simple numbers. How bad will the pain be? It's a numbers game. Some estimates put it at 7 percent or more from overall spending. But since Social Security and the military are off limits, cuts in things like education and the environment could be more like 30 percent. That's pain.
 
COMMUNICATIONS
MCI Joins Murdoch's Team
Rupert Murdoch is on a roll. He just got the F.C.C. off his back on the thorny issue of foreign ownership of American TV stations. Then last week MCI said it would invest up to $2 billion in his News Corporation. The new partners' talk was full of grand global plans, of "synergies" -- and these two companies do indeed have a history of rattling all sorts of cages. But analysts saw a coup for Mr. Murdoch, questioning those vaunted synergies. After all, even if MCI eventually owns 13.5 percent of the company, the deal gives it no true voting power. And on the news, MCI's stock fell and the News Corporation's rose. So what's in it for MCI? Clearly, a possibility of fulfilling global dreams that go beyond long distance.
 
REAL ESTATE
What Went Bankrupt?
It really comes down to two questions: 1) Come on, how could Rockefeller Center possibly be bankrupt? 2) Oh, does it really matter? To tackle No. 2 first, it was best summed up by a candy-store worker, right in the belly of the Midtown beast, who responded to a query about last week's Chapter 11 filing this way: "Truthfully, sir, I have no idea what you're talking about." As for No. 1, let's see: The family took out a huge mortgage. A Japanese company bought 80 percent of the center, paying too much. Rents fell when they were supposed to rise. And somehow, with all sorts of overlapping companies called Rockefeller Group, Rockefeller Center Properties, RCP Associates, things just stopped adding up. Is that clear now?
 
WORK FORCE
Women Pay Their Way
Not long ago, if a woman had a job, it was often for little extras -- not the meat of a family budget. Well, in case you hadn't noticed, that world is long gone. If any doubts persisted, they were dispelled by a survey released last week that showed that more than half of employed women provided at least half of their household income. The study "challenges the persistent notion that women's earnings are supplemental," said Arlene Johnson of the Families and Work Institute, co-sponsor of the survey. Not that all women want to be breadwinners -- 31 percent said that if money were abundant, they'd be tending to their families, while just 21 percent of men stated that preference. And some women, of course, have no choice -- the men aren't around.
 
MARKETS
Emerging Is as Emerging Does
It was a noble idea, fairly oozing with pioneer spirit. Three years ago the American Stock Exchange decided to give a break to some little companies that didn't quite fit the mold but that, it hoped, had boundless futures. Last week the Amex ended the experiment, called the Emerging Company Marketplace, saying no new companies would be added. Not only did some of the companies fail to emerge, but nearly a quarter of them are now worthless. The tales behind the companies range from the blatant (one's largest shareholder was a convicted arsonist) to the bizarre (another's chairman had been sued by the S.E.C., but had since had a sex-change operation). But the lesson seemed to be that there is, after all, a reason for an exchange to have rigorous rules for membership. Or simply this: Emerge first, then apply.
 
ANNUAL REPORTS
The Pepsi Investor Next Door
Pity the designers of annual reports. They're duty-bound to put heavy machinery or cereal boxes on the covers -- but don't want to make them so dull-looking that stockholders will quickly toss them. Why, they must wonder occasionally, can't they put some glamorous model on the cover? No, what a silly idea, they surely say, as they switch off their daydreams and try to think good thoughts about tractors. But apparently someone at Pepsi had that very daydream -- and forgot to wake up. And so it is that Pepsi's just-released annual report could easily be mistaken for Glamour or Vogue -- there's Cindy Crawford gazing seductively out at you -- without a soda can in sight. The cover line: "A typical investor looks us over." Sure, Pepsi, sure.
 
RIVALRIES
From Cold War to Cola War
Who says there are no superpower rivalries left? Even with the cold war over, Coke and Pepsi are still engaged in their mythic battle for the gullets of the masses. And even if Pepsi scored one for having the sexiest annual report, Coke caught the Presidential eye in Russia last week. Mr. Clinton, picking an American investment to publicize by bestowing a visit, chose a Coke plant near Moscow. There was a reasonable political explanation: Coke owns its Russian plant, while Pepsi's is a joint venture. But could it be because Coke has contributed more to Democrats lately? Or maybe Mr. Clinton, weary of vodka, craved a soda -- and figured the Coke plant was the nearest place to get a free one. It was, after all, right on the way to the airport.
 
TRANSPORTATION
You Could Always Walk
In a single century, a historical speck, we've gotten used to the odd notion that if we want to be 30 miles away in half an hour, we should be able to do it -- no matter what damage is done to the environment. Now, as the world struggles to retain that luxury, someone had the bright idea of mandating a certain number of electric cars by 1998 -- a down payment on a pristine new world of travel. But is it possible? Practical hurdles still loom, of course -- but there's more: now comes a study saying that emissions from mining and smelting the lead needed for batteries might cause their own nasty threats to public health. But what of the argument that at least pollution would be shifted away from cities? Not so, said one toxicologist; "lead particles can move long distances."
 
SOUVENIRS
23! 45! 23! Oh, Never Mind
Does Michael Jordan realize he is tampering with some basic elements of our economic system? A basketball uniform is merely a piece of cloth, but with a star's number on it, it becomes a glowing -- and pricey -- symbol of all that's glamorous. So when he picked No. 45 for his comeback, a huge industry instantly took shape -- caps, T-shirts, banners, you name it. So when he abandoned that number last week for his old 23, he demolished the value of all that stuff. It was as if Calvin Klein decided to change his name to, say, Oliver North. All those people strutting around town in their Calvin underwear would feel, well, a bit cheated. No wonder the N.B.A. fined Jordan's team for the switch; Jordan upset a delicate balance of capitalism.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Stalking the Elusive Tax-Free Bond Price Quotation

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
FOR investors in municipal bonds, it is now getting easier to find something that has long been hard to come by: bond prices.
A new program features newspaper publication of benchmark bond yields as well as an "800" number -- to begin tomorrow -- for obtaining prices for many specific issues. The initiative, the result of Federal pressure on the industry, is sponsored by the Public Securities Association, the municipal bond dealers' trade group. 
 In the stock market, prices are listed daily in the newspaper. The same is true for corporate bonds and foreign currency. And on computer screens, current prices for such investments are sometimes listed minute by minute.
But the $1.5 trillion market for tax-free municipal bonds is a strange bazaar, far more akin to the 19th century than the 20th. There is no central marketplace. Buying and selling take place among a babble of dealers, each quoting different prices. And the market's great variety makes things worse. While only about 15,000 different stocks trade in the equity markets, there are about 1.5 million separate tax-free bonds.
The result is chaos.
"Right now, it is virtually impossible to see at what prices bonds trade in the municipal market," said Robert L. D. Colby, deputy director of the division of market regulation at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
For investors, this confusion can be costly. Unless an investor shops around, it is difficult to know whether the price being quoted is the best one.
The solution is an independent source of price data. "We hope that things like the '800' number will help people get a sense of how bonds are priced, other than only through a dealer," said Mr. Colby.
Under the telephone program, a caller will pay a flat $9.95 for price and credit data on 25 different bonds. People who do not need 25 quotations at once will be assigned an account number and can obtain the additional quotes later for no extra payment.
The "800" number, operated by Kenny-Standard & Poor's, will be especially helpful for those who invest in smaller issues sold by minor cities or obscure projects. While bonds from big issuers like New York City trade daily and their prices can be easy to find, rarer bonds present difficulties.
But there is so little trading in some small issues that even the most recent price data can be woefully out-of-date. For these issues, the bond prices on the "800" number (it will be 1-800-BOND INFO) will be estimates based on trades and current interest rates. For actual prices, bond buyers must still shop around -- but at least they will have an estimated price to compare to dealers' offers.
Besides the telephone service, the program includes newspaper publication of a "yield table" for the municipal bond that has the largest market share -- the 10-year, Triple-A, insured revenue bond.
This table, similar to a yield curve, provides yield data for this bond at varying dates of maturity, along with tax-equivalent yields and historical yields. The table, marketed by Bloomberg Financial Markets, will join similar yield tables for Treasury bonds and corporate bonds that now appear in the press.

Avenue A Safari: Natives Are Restless

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
Anyone who is looking for proof that Avenue A is in the midst of a bona fide economic resurgence need not look any further than the red double-decker tour buses regularly wending their way down the street. Last month, New York Apple Tours added this once derelict street, now bustling with trendy sidewalk cafes and boutiques, to its itinerary, which includes fabled tourist attractions like the Empire State Building, Chinatown and Little Italy.
But not everyone in Alphabet City appreciates the attention. 
 "It's annoying," said Michael Farrin, a freelance book editor who lives on Avenue A and St. Mark's Place.
"I basically resent the Busch Gardens, Wild Kingdom connotation," he said. "I was sitting in my friend's second-floor apartment, and when we looked up, the tourists were looking in at us. They were eye level. It's basically very intrusive. They're trying to make the neighborhood seem exotic."
Hayim Grant, the 26-year-old president of New York Apple Tours, said he had not heard any complaints about the addition to the tour.
"We haven't had any feedback from the community," Mr. Grant said. "We're in New York to please the public and the tourists. All we're doing is trying to generate tourist dollars. I haven't heard from residents, but I wouldn't think the reaction would be negative."
Avenue A was included in the $25 tour of Manhattan because it is "an exciting" part of town, Mr. Grant said. "There are restaurants, cafes, music clubs," he said. "It's a culturally rich area."
The presence of tour buses does not surprise Tom Vesely, manager of Two Boots restaurant, at 37 Avenue A. "It's been an up-and-coming area for a few years," he said. "People are finding out it's O.K. to come to the neighborhood. My sister from Scarsdale even eats on Avenue A now."
Founded in 1992, New York Apple Tours encourages visitors to get off the bus and shop, eat or sightsee at any or all of its 48 stops. Tourists can resume the tour on another Apple bus. Buses operate between 9 A.M. and 11 P.M. daily. On Avenue A, buses stop between 8th and 9th Streets, at Tompkins Square Park, every 10 to 15 minutes.
Mr. Grant said tour guides do not inform out-of-towners that Tompkins Square Park was the site of a violent clash between police and demonstrators in 1989. "We point out Tompkins Square Park," he said, "but we try to avoid saying anything negative about New York."
Mr. Grant declined to say how many tourists had hopped off on Avenue A. But residents and merchants say they have yet to see anyone disembark.
"We'd like some of them to stop and get out and eat," said Joseph Gilbert, the chef at Zitella, an Avenue A restaurant that serves California-style Italian food. "But they're probably too leery." MONTE WILLIAMS

HEADLINE: EARNING IT:;
For Many, a Slower Climb Up the Payroll Pecking Order

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
LAWYERS are famous for being in oversupply. Any labor expert will tell you that. Yet, somehow, they are the best paid workers in America today. Obviously, lawyers who do get work don't discount their fees.
There are other surprises in the pecking order of pay for 49 occupations and professions. Elementary school teachers, thought to be greatly underpaid, are not as far down the list as widely believed. Their median weekly wage last year was $624, which means that half the teachers earned less than that amount and half more. That is better than accountants and journalists, machinists and members of the clergy. 
 The pay scales shown here are compiled by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics from monthly surveys of 65,000 households that represent all sorts of workers. Top corporate executives, of course, make more than lawyers. But as a group, top executives are too few in number to measure accurately. And while there are people who earn less than child care workers, most are working illegally or at less than the minimum wage and do not show up in the surveys.
Even without these extremes, however, the spread between the chart's highest- and lowest-paid workers -- the lawyers at $1,116 a week before taxes and the child care workers at $158 -- is several times greater than in any other large industrial country.
Other trends are evident in the data. Pay increases for many groups have been less in the 1990's than they were in the 1980's, despite a low unemployment rate during much of this decade.
"Things have changed enough so that a low unemployment rate no longer means shortages of workers and pressure to raise wages," said Frank Levy, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referring particularly to layoffs, weak unions and the great worry among many job holders that they could be dismissed. "This is no longer a phenomenon limited to the poorly educated and semiskilled."
Pay increases for doctors and nurses have slowed for a different reason: cost cutting in health care. There is one caveat, however. Pay seemed to fall in 1994 for both groups, but that may reflect a revamping of the survey last year. While the revamping probably produced more accurate data for 1994 than for previous years, comparisons of pay levels before and after the change may be skewed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The pay picture is clearer for government workers. Whatever the job -- police officer, , mail carrier or official -- public employees remain among the best-paid workers, suggesting they have not yet suffered as much wage stagnation as those in the private sector.
Pay for the less skilled and less educated has risen more slowly since 1983 than for others. But there are exceptions. Architects, highly educated, have not seen a rise in their median pay since 1990. And some workers have struck gold. Dietitians in this food-conscious nation have more than doubled their median pay since 1983, landing them just ahead of the clergy, by $1 a week.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: JAMAICA;
Forecast of Downturn?: 1,000 Jobs May Move

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Beginning in the late 1970's, the fortunes of downtown Jamaica sank as several major local employers -- Macy's, The Long Island Press, Ideal Toys, two banks and the flagship Gertz department store -- folded or moved. But a turning point came a decade ago when the Gertz family turned the eight-story department store into an office and retail complex called Gertz Plaza.
The state, seeking an anchor for the area, moved 1,000 workers from two agencies into the Plaza. Then York College built its campus nearby, and a large Social Security office moved to the neighborhood. Finally, the E, J and Z subway lines were extended and a major terminal was built at Parsons Boulevard and Archer Avenue. Next on the drawing board are a Queens Civil Courthouse and a large office for the Federal Food and Drug Administration. 
 But local officials fear Jamaica faces a new reversal because the Pataki administration is considering moving the state employees out of Gertz Plaza.
In March, Queens Borough President Claire Shulman wrote to Gov. George E. Pataki, pleading that the state offices stay where they are. "This disastrous loss of jobs and local revenue will have a very serious negative effect on the South Jamaica Economic Development Zone," Ms. Shulman wrote. "These jobs have played a major role in the resurgence of Jamaica." Aides said they have not received a reply.
A spokesman for the Governor, Christopher Chichester, said: "No decision has been made yet on a move. The administration is looking at the most cost-effective options."
A spokesman for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which employs about 550 people at Gertz Plaza, confirmed that the agency is considering a consolidation of offices now scattered in Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens.
"We are currently examining ways to relocate all facilities under one roof for economies of scale," said the spokesman, Harry Ryttenberg. Officials of the State Social Services Department, which employs about 450 people at Gertz Plaza, did not return phone calls.
Gertz Plaza occupies most of the block bounded by Jamaica and Archer Avenues, Union Hall Street and Guy R. Brewer Boulevard, opposite York College. Its tenants also include retailers and city offices.
"The secret of Jamaica's recovery has been targeted public investment," said F. Carlisle Towery, president of the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation. "We took huge hits in the 70's. The state agencies that moved to Gertz Plaza were the pioneers, and it made a major difference." That strategy helped Jamaica to thrive as a black middle-class community, he said.
Manhattan already has about 80 percent of all government jobs in the city, Mr. Towery said. Queens has only 6 percent of the government workers, he said.
"Millions of dollars of city, state and Federal money was put into revitalizing Jamaica," said Dan Andrews, an aide to Ms. Shulman, "so what sense does it make to pull 1,000 jobs out of there?"

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS: FUNDS WATCH;
Managers Developing Team Spirit

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
TO help mutual fund investors make educated decisions, the Securities and Exchange Commission told fund companies a year ago to disclose the name of their managers in the primary fund document, the prospectus. Fund companies are reluctant to do so, however, fearing investors might follow the managers if they leave the company. So more and more fund companies are taking advantage of the exemption allowed for funds run by teams. A search of the data base of Morningstar Inc., the fund tracking service in Chicago, showed that 35.5 percent of all funds were listed with "team management" at the end of April, up from 30 percent a year ago and 26 percent at the end of 1992.
 
Pay Practices
 The Securities and Exchange Commission released a report recommending that brokerage firms stop paying bigger commissions on sales of the firm's own products. The report, prepared by industry leaders at the agency's request, included several other suggestions on broker compensation. Among them is a ban on sales incentives for specific products -- something proposed by the National Association of Securities Dealers earlier this year and awaiting S.E.C. action. 
 The recommendations reflect a movement in the industry away from pushing products to professional techniques like asset allocation, said Dan Jamieson, who edits Registered Representative, an industry magazine published in Irvine, Calif. At least brokers offer a wide range of products from more than one source, Mr. Jamieson said, whereas many insurance brokers still sell only one company's products.
 
Sun and Funds
 Cruises around the world offer opportunities to learn about far more than ancient history and architecture. Several fund companies and other groups are providing investment seminars along the way for people intent on developing a financial edge as well as a golden tan.
T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore fund company, started doing cruises three years ago. Now available is a cruise of the "Great Capitals of Europe" aboard Royal Cruise Lines' Crown Odyssey. It departs on Sept. 3 from London. T. Rowe Price will offer seminars on such subjects as diversified investment strategies, asset allocation for retirees and preretirees and international investing. Royal is offering Price shareholders discounted rates and free air travel (800 945-7462). For summer cruises to Alaska, the Eastern Mediteranean and the Black Sea, identify yourself as a Price shareholder and call (800) 926-3775.
In conjuction with Royal Cruise and American Express, Scudder, Stevens & Clark will offer seminars on a 12-day cruise to Portugal, France, Britain and Ireland, departing May 17. The trip, a first for the fund company, is already sold out, though Scudder may consider others in the future.
 
The Morality Index
 Investors can do just as well with a portfolio of "socially responsible" stocks as with other stocks, concludes J. David Diltz, associcate professor of finance at the University of Texas at Arlington. Mr. Diltz examined 159 common stocks, primarily of large United States companies.
All the stocks were rated by the Council on Economic Priorities for their environmental and nuclear policies, diversity and community outreach, among other criteria. For example, the Dial Corporation got a high ranking because it makes skin products without any animal testing. Heinz also got high marks for reusable packaging and recyling programs. Among the problem companies were Dole Foods, cited for heavy pesticide use, and Dow Chemical, which participates in the nuclear arms industry.
Mr. Diltz created 14 diversified portfolios, broadly pitting socially responsible companies against others, and found little difference in performance from 1989 through 1991. He concluded that equity markets were sufficiently large, liquid and efficient to make social screening irrelevant to the performance.
 
Fund Reopenings
 T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value, which closed to new investors in March 1993, has reopened. To deter short-term trading, a 1 percent redemption fee applies to shares held less than one year.
Montgomery Micro Cap, which closed on Jan. 28, is scheduled to reopen on June 1, now that manager Roger Honour has invested the fund's cash hoard.
 
In Brief
 Matthew Weatherbie resigned as lead manager of the Putnam Voyager fund, which will fall into the hands of Roland Gillis, who worked for eight years at Keystone Custodian Funds, and Daniel L. Miller.
Scott Lucas has joined AIM Capital Management as chief equity officer.

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Car Wars;
The Corrosion at the Core of Pax Pacifica

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THIRTY-five years of more subtle methods hasfailed to get Japan's attention on trade barriers, and finally Washington is reaching for the big stick. After years of empty threats, the Administration is giving 30 days' notice of its plans to seal off a lucrative chunk of the American market, slapping a 100 percent tariff on every Toyota Lexus and Nissan Infiniti that rolls off the docks. And that's just to start.
 But when Japanese officials flipped through the dozens of pages of accusations and charts that the White House released last week, they skipped over the familiar details about America's 2 percent share of Japan's market for autos and auto parts. Their biggest concern was making sure the Americans hadn't forgotten the magic words -- the ever-present reasurrances that trade disputes are, after all, just about money. 
 They were not disappointed. "Japan is more than a major trading partner of the United States," the announcement said on page two. "It is a valued friend and ally, and a bulwark of peace, stability and democracy. Our political and strategic relations are very strong."
 Among the keepers of the "global partnership," this is called the fire wall: the assurance that trade issues will never get mixed up with the rest of the relationship, particularly America's huge and lopsided security guarantees for Japan. Those accords -- from the nuclear umbrella to the 35-year-old Mutual Security Treaty -- have been the linchpin of the Pacific in modern times, assuring America a role as the power-balancer in Asia, and at once making the world free for Japanese trade and free of Japanese militarism.
 So from Washington's viewpoint, the soothing words -- even in the midst of an unusually vituperative argument -- serve a vital purpose. They assure a country with an historic proclivity toward feeling isolated and victimized that good friends can argue and still be good friends. But in Tokyo, 30 years of repetition has given those words a different hue: No matter what the economic offense, Washington will never use its greatest trump card, its guarantee of Tokyo's security, to rectify an economic relationship gone wildly out of kilter. For decades that has given Japan the upper hand in trade disputes: they know the other side would blink first.

 
 
If Not Now . . .
 But in a world where economic security is now Job One, does it make sense for this unconditional guarantee, a remnant of the cold war, to remain in place? Is it even realistic to imagine -- as the Japanese repeatedly stated as fact last week -- that the fire wall can remain intact as Americans grow ever more convinced that nothing is changing? If a sky-high yen and the river of red ink it has let loose do not convince Japan that it must dismantle a protectionist economic system, then what will?
 For decades American officials have been loath to publicly discuss the indirect link between trade and security, or to say in public what for two years they have been telling Japanese leaders in private: that the endless cycle of threats, grudging concessions and renewed trade problems threatens to erode the alliance that grew out of the ashes of war. But the reality is there, as both sides implicitly acknowledged last week when they separately observed that this latest battle isn't so much about car parts as it is about trust.
 "We have no intention of undermining the security relationship with Japan or using our military presence there as a tool of trade," Jeffrey Garten, the under secretary of commerce for international trade and a lead negotiator in the auto talks, said in an interview. "But do the economic tensions slowly undercut the trust that has to underlie security ties? The answer has to be yes. Over a long period of time, absent an identifiable enemy, there is no precedent in history for strong security ties in the face of a highly unbalanced economic and commercial relationship."
 It is a sign of the struggle under way within the Administration on this issue that on Thursday, a day after it announced the sanctions, Joseph S. Nye Jr., assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, made a startlingly direct case for continuing to keep car parts and aircraft carriers in separate realms.
 "Some have suggested that we use our security ties to twist Japan's arm on trade," he said in a speech to the Japan Society in New York, noting that "the tactic may work in the short term." But he argued that "after a few episodes, Japan might decide to alter its long-term strategy so that it could be free from such pressure in the future." Translation: Japan's right wing would use any sign of spillover to bolster its case that America still treats Japan as if the occupation had never ended, and that it makes little sense for Japan to depend on an angry economic competitor for defense of its interests. The next logical step is obvious: Japan would have no choice but to restore itself to its role as a true world power -- dependent on no one.
 The core of Mr. Nye's argument is that America is in Japan for its own reasons, not just to defend the Japanese. The most important of those is to engage -- and if necessary contain -- China and North Korea. America's bases in Japan would be critical if North Korea's nuclear program veered out of control, and presumbably the American presence there helps to remind China about the risks of expansionism. Japan, after all, is home to an American aircraft carrier and 45,000 American troops; even without the Soviet threat, it remains what former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone called, a decade ago, the "unsinkable aircraft carrier in the Pacific." (The phrase, needless to say, did not play well in Tokyo.)

 
 
It Could Be Worse
 Mr. Nye's logic is indisputable. A $66 billion trade gap could look trifling if the alternative were a resurgent Japan that left Asian neighbors even more nervous, and that seemed unrestrained by its ties to America. "The three wars we fought in my lifetime all started out here, and I don't think it is wise to send a signal that our military is here as an instrument of trade rather than security," Walter F. Mondale, the United States ambassador to Tokyo, said last week.
 The problem is that the Japanese Government knows this, too, and brilliantly exploits the leverage it provides. Whenever Mike Mansfield, who served for 10 years as American ambassador in Tokyo, repeated his favorite phrase about Japan and America -- "the most important bilateral relationship, bar none" -- everyone in Tokyo smiled. They knew it meant that the Pentagon and the State Department would regularly step in to make sure that security always trumped trade. Almost any economic offense could be overlooked in the name of "the relationship."

 
 
The Harder Line
 Bill Clinton, who came to power vowing to lift Japan and the United States out of their destructive cycle of arguments, changed that. Today, no one in the Pentagon or the State Department dares to rein in Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, or Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, another hard-liner. When Mr. Kantor said repeatedly last week that the cabinet recommendation to impose sanctions on Japan was "reached unanimously, with no dissent," the message was clear: Cold war rules no long apply.
 Of course, those rules never applied in Tokyo, where trade and security have been opposite sides of the same coin for centuries. In a study of the issue published last year, Richard Samuels of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that what makes Japan tick is "fuan," or insecurity, a "pervasive anxiety that Japan must compensate for its special vulnerabilities in a Hobbesian world." And fuan explains Japan's enormous unwillingness to give up making its own parts in any industry vital to its survival -- cars, chips and fighter jets come to mind.
 No ruling from the fledgling World Trade Organization -- the other sanction the White House said it was going to seek -- is going to re-order an economy built on such imperatives; these are questions of civic culture, not antitrust law. So sooner or later, Mr. Clinton seems bound to return to the warning he briefly offered at the first summit of Pacific leaders in Seattle two years ago: It will be increasingly difficult for America to bear the security burden in Asia if the public believes it is regularly being rooked on trade -- a message aimed not only at Japan, but at its many admirers and imitators, from South Korea to India.
 In the real world of trade politics, of course, the choices are a lot more shaded than telling Japan it must choose between opening the market to Buicks and keeping the Seventh Fleet around. President Clinton is better practiced at this than most Presidents: Last year, when he intervened to make sure Saudi Arabia bought its aircraft from Boeing, no one explicitly linked the purchase to America's continued defense of Saudi soil. No one had to.
 But when it comes to Japan, everyone walks on eggshells, pretending that the same political realities do not apply. In fact, there is reason to wonder how much America would put at risk on Japan's behalf, and that is the subject of considerable discussion at the endless American symposiums and Japanese "study groups" that delve into the rocky marriage. Would the United States come to Japan's aid in a missile attack from North Korea? Of course. Would it guard Japanese ships that are threatened off Indonesia or keep open a Japanese trading route off the coast of China? That would be a hard sell in Congress.

 
 
Friends in Politics
 Making such warnings more explicit to the Japanese may be the only way to get through to Japanese politicians or the public. Economic policy is rarely a subject of public debate, or even much emotion, in Japanese political life; it is left to the bureaucrats, all in their own fifes. Security policy, though, is a political powder keg. No mainstream Japanese politician wants to be blamed for damaging the American alliance, and all know that the current arrangement -- in which Japan pays billions of dollars toward the cost of keeping American forces based there -- keeps Japan from making hard choices of its own.
 No one wants to send the signal that America is using trade problems as an excuse to disengage, militarily or economically, in the region where most of its economic opportunity lies. But the current course has its dangers. When sanctions fly, so do stereotypes. Japanese already view America as a nation of whiners and sore losers, interested in free trade only if they win. Even when Japan is down -- Toyota is talking about its first plant closings and layoffs since 1951 -- America views Japanese as unreconstructed mercantilists. "Both parties need to look at what is at stake," James A. Baker 3d, the former Secretary of State, said last week. "There are things dogging this relationship in a way that have not dogged it in the past."

HEADLINE: The World;
For Serbs, a Reckoning

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia

 BODY:
IT was not so much the Croatian armed forces sweeping through the Serbian enclave of western Slavonia this month that gave a sense of the direction of the Balkan wars. It was the fleets of Croatian builders, engineers, bankers and telecommunications experts following in their wake.
 Quickly, they went to work. They set up post offices. They installed telephone lines. They opened banks and organized pension funds. They began repairs on roads that had been disappearing beneath undergrowth. 
 Until this blitz, the area had remained essentially untouched since it fell under the control of Serbs who resisted joining an independent Croatia in 1991. Buildings still lay in ruins. Public gardens and squares were untended, decay rampant.

 
 
Serbs in Crisis
 The atmosphere in this part of Krajina, the self-styled republic of Croatia's separatist Serbs, was redolent of that in the Krajina capital, Knin, a railway junction where no trains run and men spend long hours gazing into a middle distance blurred by innumerable glasses of plum brandy.
 The western Slavonian debacle suggested that the Serbs are in crisis. Four years after they began their battle to remain in a single state despite the destruction of Yugoslavia, they are divided between moderates and radicals, and between the Communists-turned-socialists in Belgrade and the right-wing nationalists in their Bosnian stronghold of Pale.
 The Serbs' armed forces are not improving, but those of their Muslim and Croatian enemies are. Most decisively, the sanctions-battered economy of the Serbs' far-flung lands has reached a gloomy cul-de-sac at a time when the ultimate goal of so much Serbian sacrifice has become unclear. Serbs often say they win wars only to lose the peace; the danger of adding a new chapter to this lore has never looked greater.
 Croatia, by contrast, appears to be on the move, politically and economically, if the western Slavonian campaign is an indication. The country's proximity to the European Union, the quiet support of the United States, and the presence of a large United Nations mission have led to a considerable injection of hard currency and technology.
 In villages just retaken from the Serbs last week, Croatian soldiers were already using digital phone cards at newly-installed public phones. Such telephones do not exist in Serbia.
 Moreover, the Croatian Government of President Franjo Tudjman appears to have learned something from its provocative mistakes in 1990 and 1993. Before independence, Mr. Tudjman went out of his way to provoke Serbs, stripping them of their status as a constituent people of Croatia, throwing them out of state jobs, and describing the massacres of Serbs by Croats during World War II as exaggerated. His attitude did much to provoke the 1991 war, and this was underscored in 1993, when Serbian civilians living near the Adriatic coast were mutilated and killed in their homes.
 Since then somebody -- probably the United States or Germany -- has whispered something in Mr. Tudjman's ear. The message was simple: If Croatia's pretentions to joining Western Europe are to stop looking grotesque, the country had to change its attitude toward its Serbian minority.
 Serbian Orthodox churches throughout western Slavonia were untouched during the Croatian military campaign this month; Croatian politicians were dispatched to pay homage to the countless Serbian victims of the World War II Croatian Fascist death camp at Jasenovac; and the message drummed out on radio and television was that Serbs are equal citizens.
 The history of conflict between Croats and Serbs this century has been so painful that it will take many years for this message to be convincing. Thousands of Serbs lost their homes in western Slavonia this month, opting for flight into Bosnia, and several hundred were killed as they fled. This will not be quickly forgotten. But Mr. Tudjman appears to have set out to show the secessionist Serbs in the 24 percent of the country they occupy that they could enjoy a better future as part of Croatia.

 
 
Message Received
 Mr. Milosevic, it seems, may not be averse to this message from Zagreb. He abandoned western Slavonia with only a whisper of protest and has apparently concluded that the Serbs marooned around Knin cannot be defended. What he wants is eastern Slavonia -- that is the oil-rich Serbian-occupied area of Croatia near Vukovar -- and effective control over a goodly chunk of Bosnia, say 50 percent.

 
 
Divisions
 For these goals, the Serbian President's main opposition may now lie as much among Serbs as elsewhere. Croatia will not acccept Serbian annexation of eastern Slavonia, but an interim solution could be envisaged. The Muslim-led Bosnian Government does not have the power or support to control the whole of the country.
 However, Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, wants more than 50 percent of Bosnia, and he wants his own state there now. Mr. Martic, in Knin, is fiercely opposed to remaining within Croatia, even with considerable Serbian self-rule. They have the power to be thorns in Mr. Milosevic's side. But their failure to do more than fire a few rockets at Zagreb in response to the western Slavonian defeat suggests they may be growing weaker.
 The Yugoslav jigsaw remains as intractable as ever. But there is something new: The western Slavonian defeat suggests that the strategic interest of Serbs now lies in a quick resolution of the puzzle.

HEADLINE: The World: The Refugee Deal;
Clinton and Castro Buy Some Time

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
THE sight of United States Coast Guard vessels sailing into a Cuban harbor to hand boat people back to Cuban authorities last week encouraged speculation that the Western Hemisphere's two closest enemies may soon be examining additional forms of cooperation.
 Certainly Cuban exile groups fear that prospect. But such talk may be much too premature. 
 Consider what was really accomplished in the deal over refugees that was announced May 2: Fidel Castro accepted a big restraint on his ability to unnerve the United States (unleashing a tide of disgruntled Cubans was one of the few weapons still left in his quiver), but in doing so he took the pressure off President Clinton to go much further any time soon.
 With an election year looming and the immigration issue now apparently settled for the moment, the Administration has little incentive to seek a full or immediate normalization of relations. Indeed, American officials have said a broad rapprochement, including any easing of the 33-year-old economic embargo, depends on Cuba taking basic steps to open up its political system. And this is something Mr. Castro has repeatedly indicated he will not do.

 
 
Keep Waiting
 "Unless you see Fidel release a large number of political prisoners or begin a real dialogue with the external opposition, I don't think you are going to see any significant movement on Washington's side," a Latin American diplomat here predicted. That may not exclude some tinkering around the edges of the relationship, such as reducing restrictions on travel or on cultural and educational exchanges. But Cuban officials seem resigned to waiting -- at least until Mr. Clinton wins a second term -- for more fundamental changes.
 By jettisoning a policy of preferential treatment for Cuban refugees that had been in place for more than 30 years, Mr. Clinton essentially wrote off any prospect of winning the Cuban-American vote in Florida next year, but he was never their favorite anyway. Francisco J. Hernandez, president of the influential Cuban-American National Foundation, described Tuesday's return of the first rafters to Cuba as "a day of infamy for the United States," and other Cuban exiles have been sporadically blocking highways and streets in Miami to protest the decision.
 But the deal announced May 2 may nevertheless bring political gain for Mr. Clinton in Florida, the nation's fourth most populous state, with 14 million people and 25 electoral votes. Many white and black voters have long expressed alarm at the Hispanic influx, and presumably they will welcome any reduction in the flow and influence of Cubans. Thus, the President's action was applauded both by conservative talk-show hosts and by editorials in virtually all the state's mainstream newspapers.
 For their part, Cuban officials have an obvious interest in fortifying Mr. Clinton's position; they want to avoid a Republican victory in 1996 that could bring a return of the confrontational tone that marked relations during the Reagan years. When reporters suggested to one top Cuban official, Ricardo Alarcon, that the Clinton Administration had gained more from the immigration agreement than Cuba, he replied that "it wouldn't bother me if many people in the United States want to look at it that way."
 Of course, with the Republicans now in control of Congress, efforts are already under way to block any further opening. A proposal popularly known as the Helms-Burton bill would penalize foreign governments, companies and individuals who do business with Cuba by excluding them and their products from the United States. It would also allow Americans to sue foreigners who have invested here in properties the Cuban Government confiscated from Americans.

 
 
Fearing a Compromise
 Officially, the Clinton Administration opposes the legislation on ground that it could conflict with broader United States interests. But Cuban officials and diplomats here worry that Mr. Clinton could end up agreeing to a diluted version of it.
 In the meantime, the Helms-Burton bill is providing Mr. Castro with a splendid opportunity for a propaganda offensive -- so much so that some diplomats here suspect the Communist Party leadership would really prefer to see the proposal become law. Through public hearings being held in factories and schools and broadcast on Cuban television, the Government has instilled fear that hordes of exiles would return to a post-Castro Cuba to reclaim old houses and businesses and displace those who live and work there now. The bill might also, diplomats here say, provide him with a pretext to renege on the immigration accord if he feels he needs to do so.

 
 
Deflecting Attention
 To some extent, the mobilization campaign against the Helms-Burton bill has also enabled the Cuban Government to deflect attention from its own economic difficulties. The country is just finishing another disappointing sugar harvest amid continuing widespread shortages of food and basic consumer goods.
 Such problems have encouraged some American officials and lawmakers to conclude that Cuba is vulnerable to increased economic pressure. But Cubans have learned to live with scarcities, and in some other important respects the situation here is not as grim as it was a year ago, at the start of a long hot summer that saw more than 30,000 Cubans take to the seas in flimsy rafts. Thanks to tourism, foreign investment and remittances from Cuban-Americans, Cuba has more foreign exchange, which increases the availability of gasoline, electricity and basic items like rice and beans.
 As a result, the Cuban Government seems more likely than ever to adhere to its traditional formulation: that it wants better relations with the United States, but not at the cost of its independence or sovereignty. "There is a feeling here, whether merited or not, that they have hit bottom and come up a little bit, that they now have some breathing space," said a diplomat who represents a country generally critical of Mr. Castro. "That gives them somewhat greater confidence in dealing with a whole range of issues."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Just Say 'I Dunno';
Half a Wit Meets Technology

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
SUMMER is coming. It's time for all patriots to prepare to exercise their all-American right to read lowest-common-denominator fiction, swill reruns and make Hollywood blockbusters into box-office hits.
 And why not? Isn't stupidity in fashion? People flock to movies that lionize fools. They scarf up books billed as being for dummies. On the airwaves, they shoot their mouths off about things they know little about (and millions tune in to hear). 
 Could it be that the technical complexity of contemporary life -- installing a fax modem, programming the phone -- has left us so rattled that it has become an act of defiance to idolize goofballs and advertise oneself as one?

 
 
Lovable Fools
 Remarkably, plenty of smart people and professional contrarians say no. They insist they haven't noticed that dumb is suddenly in vogue. They muster an impressive array of counter-arguments that go like this:
 * It's not new. Dumb, or something like it, is all-American. Anti-intellectualism, at least, is almost a national trait. And it's healthy. No democracy wants an aristocracy of intelligence telling it how to behave.
 * The fool has long been a stock comic figure in popular culture. Take Jerry Lewis, the Three Stooges, Punch and Judy. And many humorists, like Will Rogers, have long based their appeal on being just plain folks.
 * What ails us isn't dumbness, it's something else. Maybe it's media sensationalism, but that's not new. Or perhaps viciousness in political discourse is on the rise; but that, too, comes and goes.
 * Anyway, who's to say what's dumb? Or, as Jack Romanos, president of Simon & Schuster Consumer Publishing Group, put it: "What makes anyone think Howard Stern is not an intellectual?" (Mr. Romanos's company publishes Mr. Stern.)
 It's true, braininess has never been Americans' most popular trait. Americans value good, old common sense. Notions like equality and individualism encourage the belief that each person is as capable as the next.
 It's also true that anti-intellectualism appears to ebb and flow -- coinciding sometimes with bad economic times, sometimes with religiously-based political and fundamentalist movements. It surfaced in the 1920's around the time of the Scopes trial. Later, "pinko" professors were a favorite target of Senator Joseph McCarthy, and Adlai Stevenson was derided as an "egghead." Historians say it returned in response to protests against the Vietnam War.
 In Ronald Reagan, Americans eagerly found wisdom in ignorance. And now, even members of Congress with Ph.D.'s seem to find it useful to enlist the language of anti-intellectualism in attacking the cultural elite.

 
 
Stupidity on a Pedestal
 On the whole, intellectuals tend to be laughed at, loathed or ignored, said Stanley Katz, president of the American Council of Learned Societies. In the United States, he and others say, intellectual is a dirty word. But what is happening now may not exactly be an anti-intellectual resurgence (though some say that is happening, too). People say they see signs of a positive embracing of stupidity, a glorifying of dumbness.
 O.K., maybe some of these films are about innocence, not idiocy. But what about "Tommy Boy" and "Dumb and Dumber"? What about "Beavis and Butt-head" on TV? Due out in theaters soon: "The Stupids."
 IDG Books has printed 18 million copies of its wildly successful " . . . for Dummies" series -- leaping from "PCs for Dummies" to activities once thought manageable. Like parenting and, yes, sex. Macmillan Computer Publishing has followed suit with "Complete Idiot" guides.
 In public life, politicians hide their expertise to curry favor with voters. They profess to hate politics, just like everyone else. Washington insiders run as outsiders against Washington. The public laps it up.
 On talk radio, on the Internet and in public-opinion polling, the unabashed step forward in limitless supply, solicited by Rush Limbaugh and others to opine about anything, whether they know about it or not. "Let me get back to you on that after I've done some reading" is not an option in polls, Michael Kinsley pointed out recently in The New Yorker, bemoaning the celebration of "ignorant opinion and undifferentiated rage."
 Plenty of people see nothing new in all this. They say an American's God-given right has always been to shoot his mouth off. Just because more people now have a chance to do it doesn't make for a vogue of dumbness. "There are more people engaged now in the national dialogue," said Garry Wills. "People who were silent before are now being heard. That doesn't mean they have become any dumber. They may have become smarter."
 Tom Wolfe, too, says he hasn't noticed anything different. The media are simply more vivid. Instead of comic books, we have "comic books put on the screen. I don't think the appetite changes over decades."
 Among those who suspect the appetite has indeed changed, many round up the usual suspects: Critics blame the media, the media blame Hollywood, Hollywood blames capitalism and popular tastes.
 But more than a few people suggest a couple of other culprits: the increasing technical complexity of contemporary life, and certain anxieties about the country's economic future and its place in the world.
 When David G. Israel, vice president of publishing for Macmillan Computer Publishing USA, joined the company several years back, he used to joke in meetings that the company needed a book called "Yo, Stupid! It's a Computer."
 "There is almost an assumption that there is a technological elite that makes everyone else feel a little inferior," he said. "People do feel a little bit stupid -- or like idiots -- about things."
 Then IDG's " . . . for Dummies" series took off The gimmick now works with more than computers. "The logic is, well, computers aren't the only thing that people feel inadequate about," Mr. Israel said.
 The titles, course, work on two levels. For those with some vestige of self-esteem, there's something deliciously self-deprecating and ironic about embracing the label of idiot while mastering something quite so clever as Unix.
 An argument similar to Mr. Israel's can be made on a grander scale. Andrew Ross, director of the graduate program in American Studies at New York University, traces some of the taste for dumbness to a knowledge-based society.
The growing emphasis on specialized expertise has made people anxious about being left behind. At a time when white men, in particular, are said to be feeling pangs of lost privilege, "Forrest Gump" comes along. "Here you have a white male of fairly limited intelligence who still manages to have a profound impact on culture and politics," Professor Ross said. That narrative has special appeal, he said, when people are being shunted into mindless, low-wage jobs.
 As Professor Ross puts it, popular culture may be giving voice to anxieties about "the power exercised by knowledge elites," and it may be expressing a backlash against challenges to white-male privilege. "Some people would say it's an awful lot of sociological baggage to overload upon these things," he said. "But some of us take popular culture very seriously."
 Others think they see something similar at work.
 Robert Pollack, a professor of biological sciences and former dean of Columbia College, is struck these days by the "willful naivete" that many students "want to maintain in the face of a complicated world." He describes this as "a wish to remain innocent: If I don't understand the complexity, it doesn't bother me." He said many students' "fix on the world is that it is a place to outwit, not a place to help run."

 
 
Idiocy as a Survival Skill
 "It's a misplaced sense of how to survive" in a society in economic decline, he said. "It's the academic equivalent of a girl who dumbs herself down on a date -- to pass by appearing to be less curious than you are."
 One day recently, Richard Amyx, a computer-industry middle manager in San Jose, Calif., and chairman of American Mensa Ltd., the high-IQ society (which, by the way, just bailed out of Brooklyn and moved its headquarters to an office tower in Fort Worth), was appalled to read on a bumper sticker: My kid just beat up your honors student.
 "That encapsulates the attitude right there," Mr. Amyx said glumly.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
First Comes the Smoke (then Mirrors) in Budget's Maze

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"LET me tell you about Commerce quickly," Representative John R. Kasich, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said Thursday evening on "The MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour." "We, for example, did in fact kill programs in Commerce. The advanced technology program, which gives millions of dollars to big corporations for research, is eliminated. The U.S. Tourism and Travel Administration, the Economic Development Administration. We have 300 economic development programs in the Federal Government. We wiped them out."
 The next morning, at a news conference on the budget, Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic minority leader, had this to say: "The concern, I guess, that many of us have in particular has to do with the significant tax increase that this budget resolution has for many working families. For 12 million working families, there will be a $21 billion tax increase over the course of the next seven years." 
 Wait! Stop! No one has killed anything at the Commerce Department. And the budget measures would not raise taxes. Mr. Kasich and Mr. Daschle were blowing the kind of smoke that shrouds the Capitol and obscures what really happened last week in the House and Senate budget committees.

 
 
A Year to Go
 What did happen was plenty important. But it was arcane, not the sort of stuff that wins attention in a television interview or news conference. That is why politicians talk about other things.
 What really happened was that the House and Senate Budget Committees, on party-line votes, approved separate measures known as budget resolutions, the first steps in a year-long budget process.
 The resolutions establish the amount of money that can be spent in each of the next seven years in 20 broad areas of the Government like transportation, energy, national defense and income security. The resolutions also provide instructions to Congressional committees about how much money they they can allocate for the programs under their jurisdiction.
 And that is all that is binding on anyone. The real decisions about what will be cut and what will be preserved will come later.
 In many cases, the budget resolutions include recommendations of policies that might be adopted to meet the dollar limits being set. In budget lingo, these are called "assumptions." But these are suggestions -- no more, no less.
 Mr. Kasich's committee did suggest that the Commerce Department be shut down, some of its functions abolished and others dispersed among other departments and agencies. The Senate Budget Committee did recommend rolling back an expansion of the earned income tax credit, a tax break for low-income workers, that is supposed to go into effect 1996 and withdrawing the credit from a relatively small number of childless couples who first became eligible last year.
 But no one can say with any confidence that these suggestions will be carried out. Larry Stein, who was staff director of the Budget Committee when Democrats controlled the Senate, said that in his experience no more than 50 percent to 60 percent of the assumptions in budget resolutions were ever followed.
 What the Republicans are not talking much about is what they did last week that was significant. The goal set by their budget resolutions of a balanced Federal budget by 2002 without increased taxes or cuts in Social Security or the military would require such large savings that some of the most popular activities of the Federal Government would have to be dismantled. The Republicans are pretending otherwise.
 For example, in the case of Medicare, the program that would take the single biggest hit under both the House and Senate resolutions, the Republicans, when pressed, make two assertions intended to minimize the sacrifice involved. The first is that the program, which provides health insurance for the elderly and disabled, would actually continue to grow but at a rate of only about 7 percent a year instead of the current 10 percent. The second is that the slower growth could be achieved not by reducing benefits to the elderly or significantly lowering payments to doctors and hospitals but by encouraging retirees to enroll in the kind of cost-efficient managed care plans used by most American workers.
 The problem with the slower-growth argument is that the rising cost of Medicare is not caused by an expansion of the program. The Government's costs are mushrooming because of overall inflation in health prices and because many more people become eligible for benefits each year.
 The problem with the managed-care argument is that there is little evidence to suggest that quick savings could be achieved in an elderly population requiring on average much more expensive medical treatment than people of working age.
 The Republicans are right that the budget cannot be balanced without saving money in the vast Medicare program. But nearly every authority believes that such savings would force retirees to pay more for health insurance or would substantially reduce the services available to them or both.
 What the Democrats are not saying is that as individuals and as a party they have abandoned the goal of deficit reduction, their top priority in the first two years of the Clinton Presidency and a policy advocated by almost every economist in America. Under President Clinton's latest budget, large deficits would remain year after year. Not a single Democrat in Congress came forward last week to propose a better way to lower the deficit than the Republicans'.
 The reason is clear. The only way to reduce the deficit and preserve their cherished social programs is to raise taxes. In today's political climate, that is not an option any Democrat with hopes of regaining control of Congress would dare suggest.

HEADLINE: When Nikes Tread on the Guccis;
Will Fifth Ave. Forsake Luxury And Go Suburban?

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

 BODY:
As a latter-day Margaret Mead might note, the land that is Fifth Avenue from Rockefeller Center to 58th Street is populated by two tribes, two groups with distinct markings, customs and mythologies.
There are the luxury-store customers, known by their Prada handbags and tailored retro suits, the wealthiest of whom are dropped by Lincoln Town Car at the 58th Street back door to Bergdorf Goodman. 
 This spring, more than any season in memory, they are sharing Fifth Avenue with another tribe, in shorts and running shoes, foraging for $12 Coca-Cola baseball caps and Tasmanian Devil plush toys. These budget tourists, who have long come to ogle, are now drawn by mass-market retailers that have flooded the avenue in the last 18 months, transforming it into a landscape as familiar as any suburban galleria.
Ever since the first mall-type stores announced that they were setting up shop along Fifth Avenue's platinum belt, retail analysts have warned that the hoi polloi would chase away the carriage trade.
So far, evidence of flight is slim, and many shop managers tout a new vitality on the sidewalks and a ringing of cash registers. But other merchants say the new crowds aren't buying luxury goods, just souvenir T-shirts.
The skeptics attribute the good health to the economic recovery and the weak dollar, and they worry about the avenue's long-term future. Mass-market shops such as the Warner Bros. Studio Store, which are on Fifth for public relations as much as profit, are driving rents up. Mall-ification, these skeptics warn, may accelerate a mini-migration of luxury stores to Madison Avenue near 59th Street.
"The dumbing down of Fifth Avenue is full steam ahead," said Alan G. Millstein, an analyst who has been a consultant to stores in the neighborhood. "In the long term, it seems the only people who'll pay the outrageous rents are mall-based stores with more appeal to the masses than the classes."
Whatever the economic effects, there's no doubt that the culture of Fifth Avenue, one of the world's most gilded shopping districts, is changing profoundly. Between the traditional anchors of Saks Fifth Avenue, at 50th Street, and Bergdorf Goodman, the last year has seen the opening of such mall staples as Banana Republic and 9 West. Levi's, Nike and Disney superstores are on the way.
They join the Coca-Cola gift shop, which opened in 1991, and the 18-month-old Warner Bros. store on the northeast corner of 57th Street. The heavily trafficked intersection has been nicknamed the Four Carats, because its corners are occupied by Tiffany, Bulgari, Van Cleef & Arpels and Bugs Bunny.
"I loathe the Coke store, the Disney store," said Roxane Bednar, a New Yorker who was headed for tea at the Plaza Hotel dressed in a fashionable cream-colored suit. "They're destroying the most elegant corner of New York. This is not Hollywood or Florida. This is Fifth Avenue."
But Tom Cusick, president of the Fifth Avenue Association, a merchants' group, says that the Coke store and other mass retailers have helped the thoroughfare rebound from a troubled period in the early 90's. Noting that the Warner store filled a site that had been vacant for more than five years, he said, "I don't see how that kind of a change is a negative impact on the carriage trade."
He also cites zoning changes that have reduced the number of banks and airline ticket offices in favor of retail stores, and the departure of illegal peddlers and several stores with going-out-of-business sales perpetually plastering their windows. The changes have led to heavy pedestrian traffic. The association has counted 8,000 to 10,000 people an hour during peak business from 11 A.M. to 3 P.M.
No one denies that the sidewalks are more crowded, but merchants and analysts do debate whether those crowds are good news for blue-chip Fifth Avenue.
"You have a higher volume of traffic," said Joseph Ming, president of Bally of Switzerland, "but the buying power of the traffic is not as concentrated as it was before." This summer, Bally is moving its $250 loafers and $400 handbags from Fifth and 55th Street to Madison Avenue and 59th Street. "People don't just walk," Mr. Ming said. "They sit and stand and eat in front of the stores. It's almost hard to get through sometimes."
In its new location near Barneys New York, which opened there two years ago, Bally joins superstores selling Calvin Klein and Ann Taylor that are scheduled to open this year. Ann Taylor has been in temporary quarters on East 57th Street since it moved to make way for Levi's.
Paola Fuchs is manager of the Italian designer Martino Midali's new boutique, which opened last week on Madison between 78th and 79th streets. She said Mr. Midali had chosen the site because "the shops on Madison cater to a more sophisticated woman, and he felt Fifth Avenue was more for tourists."
Bally, along with the leather store Goldpfeil and the high-society restaurant La Cote Basque, is being displaced by the Disney Studio Store, which is to open in 1996. La Cote Basque closed last month after 36 years on East 55th Street and plans to reopen later this year in a smaller space on West 55th Street. Although figures were not disclosed, the Walt Disney Company is said to be paying a much higher rent for the site.
The mass retailers have helped push Fifth Avenue rents back up to first place worldwide. They had slumped in the early 90's recession, but as of March, rents from 49th to 57th streets averaged $392 per square foot, just ahead of the Ginza in Tokyo, where they averaged $385 per square foot, according to the Hirschfeld Group, a retail consulting firm.
Mr. Millstein, the analyst, said it is unlikely that mass-market retailers can meet the rents with sales of $20 T-shirts, even by the truckload. The stores are not designed to be profitable, he said, but as part of elaborate public-image campaigns. "They're using them as showcases to impress their shareholders and the New York investment community," he said, "not as traditional stores.
"All the guys who work on Wall Street but never get out to malls are finally seeing these mall-based retailers."
Kevin Kutcher, a spokesman for Nike, which plans to open a 100,000-square-foot store in Trump Tower, agreed. "Our object with the store is both financial and image-oriented," he said. "There's a dual goal there." The Nike store will occupy the old home of Bonwit Teller and Galeries Lafayette.
Some analysts point to the cautionary tale of Trump Tower, which has declined as an icon of luxury. With a worldwide reputation as a pit stop for the very rich, it drew hordes of tourists, but they proved to be a turn-off to wealthy shoppers. Buccellati, Charles Jourdan and other tony retailers exited, to be replaced by the likes of Tower Records, which opened an 8,000-square-foot store last year.
In the pink marble atrium, tourists cluster at a balcony above the 80-foot waterfall, the Grand Canyon overlook of Fifth Avenue. Anna and Angelo Napolitano of Naples paused to aim a camcorder. They had come from Banana Republic and the Coca-Cola store and hoped to visit "some shops to find Nikes, Levi's," Mr. Napolitano said. As for other stores in the neighborhood -- Chanel and Tiffany -- they were not interested.
Still, it's far from clear that Fifth Avenue's chic stores will fall like so many dominoes. The recession has lifted along the avenue, especially for high-end merchants. Tiffany's New York store reported $131 million in sales in 1994, an 11 percent increase over the previous year. Bergdorf Goodman's women's store, bucking a recession in the apparel business, saw a rise in sales "in the mid-single digits" this spring over last year, said Peter Farwell, a spokesman.
And as some luxury stores leave, others arrive. The designer Gianni Versace plans to open his first New York boutique between 51st and 52d streets later this year. Chanel, now next door to the Warner store, is expanding into two floors just down the block, at 15 East 57th, when it finishes a major expansion of the building in 1996.
"Our store at 5 East 57th is doing better than it's done in the last three years," said Arie L. Kopelman, the president of Chanel Inc. "If the Warner store were a negative, we'd have seen it."
Mr. Kopelman disputes the proposal that the two Fifth Avenues -- the one of mass and the other of class -- cannot happily co-exist.
"I think it's dated and not where the action is today to be in an all-luxury neighborhood," he said. "Maybe that little girl who's thrilled to walk out of the Warner store with her Bugs Bunny doll will point to something in the Chanel window and say, 'Mommy, can I have that?' She's ready to trade up."
But none of the customers in the Coke store eyeing $5 fountain-style glasses totes a Chanel shopping bag. It may be true that two tribes of shoppers share the sidewalks, but they cast a wary eye on one another, rarely crossing into each other's turf.
"If we hit the lottery, we'll hit the other stores," said Laura Helms, who with her husband, Charles, emerged from the Warner store with a Marvin the Martian shirt and cup for their 11-year-old daughter, who was home in Bloomingburg, N.Y. A shopping bag from Planet Hollywood held their other purchase of the day, a T-shirt.
Mimi Gilpatric, a New Yorker who carried a straw hat in a Saks Fifth Avenue bag, said Saks and Bergdorf were the only stores she patronized. Of the mass-market retailers she said, "I think they have no quality, no class."
If a defining change is coming, it could arrive with the opening of Nike Town, which will feature the kind of flashy diversions found in other Nike stores: banks of video monitors embedded in the floor, a half-basketball court and a media room to watch Nike commercials. A Nike Town that opened in 1992 on Michigan Avenue in Chicago has become one of the city's top tourist attractions, drawing a large number of teen-agers.
Gemma Hall, a New Yorker originally from Italy, compared Fifth Avenue to Rome's famed Piazza di Spagna, once an enclave of luxury shopping. "They started to put in stores like this," she said, gesturing to the roost of Tweety Bird and Sylvester the Cat. "And places like McDonald's, trying to be trendy. Now when I go to Rome they say only tourists go there."
The same fate, she said, could befall Fifth Avenue: "Eventually, people will go elsewhere."

HEADLINE: Study Ties Educational Gains To More Productivity Growth

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
The first detailed American business survey of its kind, a study conducted by the Census Bureau for the Federal Department of Education, has found that increases in workers' education levels produce twice the gain in workplace efficiency as comparable increases in the value of tools and machinery.
The findings, to be released today, are based on interviews with managers and owners of about 3,000 businesses employing 20 workers or more. It found that a 10 percent increase in the educational attainment of a company's workforce resulted in an 8.6 percent increase in productivity. A 10 percent increase in the value of capital stock such as tools, buildings and machinery, produced only a 3.4 percent increase in productivity, the survey found. 
 The study immediately took on political overtones, particularly for Democrats.
Clinton Administration officials immediately said the report, which was originally commissioned by the Bush Administration, was a powerful argument for the education and training programs Mr. Clinton has championed and against the broad-based cuts in such programs proposed by Republicans in Congress.
"These are very, very dramatic results," said Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, "and what they show is the utter folly of the Republican budget proposals, which would cut education and training in hopes of boosting somewhat the incentives to invest in physical capital. What this shows clearly is that human capital is the nation's most precious asset. The Republicans have got their productivity calculus exactly backward."
Republicans said investing in people was important, but not in the way the Democrats want to do it.
"Americans have flat out rejected the notion of Uncle Sam being more involved in their lives, and the Clinton Administration simply has not gotten the message," said Representative Howard P. (Buck) McKeon, a California Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee on postsecondary education, training and life-long learning.
Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard University, said many economists believed that the rate of return for education was at least comparable to the return for investment in equipment. But he said he could not evaluate the findings without studying them in detail. "Two to one sounds a bit extravagant, but I have not seen the study," he said.
Robert Zemsky, a co-director of the group at the University of Pennsylvania that designed the survey, said, "We're as confident of the results as we know how to be." But he added that the figures could change at different times. He plans to repeat the survey in three years.
Various studies over the years have documented the degree to which education correlates with higher wages for employees. Recent research indicates that employees gain an 8 percent average increase in income for each additional year of schooling they receive, in high school, college or graduate school.
But this is the first broad-based survey to document the degree to which education is directly linked to productivity. The report's most striking finding -- that a 10 percent increase in educational attainment produced an 8.6 percent increase in productivity -- means that for each additional year of schooling in their workforce, employers gain in productivity roughly what employees gain in income.
The effect increases to 11 percent for the nonmanufacturing sector, the area where the most job growth is occurring, as Mr. Reich noted. However, in manufacturing, while a 10 percent increase in capital stock produced a 2.6 percent increase in productivity, a 10 percent increase in education resulted in a small but statistically insignificant productivity gain.
In manufacturing industries, the impact was strongest on makers of industrial machinery and equipment, including electronics, and on printing and publishing companies. In the nonmanufacturing area, the effect was strongest in construction and communications. Education had the lowest impact on productivity in wholesale and retail trade.
The findings come at a critical time in the debate over educational policy, when Republicans in the House have proposed cutting by a third the $8 billion a year the Government spends on education and training programs. That includes eliminating Mr. Clinton's $250 million School to Work program establishing connections between schools and work sites. The program will be a year old on Wednesday.
And the findings come as a striking coda to a widely circulated report from the same research project three months ago that documented the overwhelming lack of confidence employers have in schools. That study found that employers were far more likely to look to other sources, like their equipment suppliers, than to schools when seeking new employees. Analysts said the study reflected an alarming divide at a time when nations like Japan have forged successful alliances between schools and employers.
The new survey, designed by the National Center on the Educational Quality of the Workforce at the University of Pennsylvania, measured productivity in terms of sales, controlled by hours worked. Business ranged across the employment spectrum from offices to factories to construction sites.
Companies were asked about the nature of their business, annual sales, principal products and services, investment in equipment and buildings, costs of production materials, annual sales and the wages and educational levels of employees.
Businesses of the same type were compared in surveys that controlled for factors including size, age of equipment, hours worked and whether the businesses had single or multiple product lines.
The findings are particularly stark in light of the first part of the survey, released in February, which found employers increasingly divorced from the schools and lacking confidence in their ability to train young people for the workplace.
That survey found that in hiring, employers tended to disregard grades and school evaluations and instead based their judgments on factors like attitude, communication skills, previous work experience and recommendations from current employees or previous employers.
The current report finds that companies that do make use of student grades in hiring or that forge links with schools in terms of internships or training programs tend to also show higher productivity and more innovative workplace practices.
"The lesson that emerges from our research is a simple one," the report said. "What is required to end the disconnection between schools and employers are more direct, substantive and businesslike transactions between the two."
Mr. Zemsky said the critical connection between the February report and the results released today is that a workplace that devalues schools and education at the same time it is increasingly relying on an educated workforce is headed for trouble.

HEADLINE: A Safer Society -- A special report.;
Japanese Say No to Crime: Tough Methods, at a Price

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: MITO, Japan

 BODY:
To understand why Japan is probably the safest industrialized country in the world, it helps to talk to a short, squat man with rumpled clothes, a gentle smile and big, leathery hands that once picked up a hammer and crushed his neighbor's head.
The murderer, who killed his neighbor after stealing money from him, is now 62, out of prison and on parole in this small city in eastern Japan. But his experience is testimony to the tough public attitude against crime. 
 No one in the murderer's family ever visited him in the 15 years and 3 months that he was in prison. His wife and son have met him since his release, but have told him never to return to the village where they live.
His three daughters, now all married, have refused to see him. "I have four grandchildren, I think," he said, but he has never met them or seen their pictures. The murderer, like other criminals interviewed, asked that he not be identified.
More than any other developed country, Japan has resolved to "just say no" to crime. Japanese society ostracizes offenders and demands that they not just be caught but that they also confess and show remorse.
Japan and the United States have vastly different societies, but at a time when Americans say in some surveys that their No. 1 concern is crime, when Congress and the White House are searching for new ways to make streets safer, Japan may offer some lessons about ways to achieve security -- and the price of that safety.
Handguns are banned in Japan, and the police and the courts have powers that would make American civil libertarians weep. Prison sentences are short, but prisons are grim places where some inmates are not allowed to talk to each other.
All this, coupled with strong families, a sense of social cohesiveness and an egalitarian distribution of wealth, has created what may be the real Japanese Miracle: not just one of the richest countries in the world but also just about the safest.
The poison gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in March killed 12 people, injured more than 5,500, frightened people across Japan and captured headlines around the world. But it was a fluke.
Until that terrorist attack, there had never been a killing recorded in Tokyo's subways, which carry 75 percent more people each day than New York City's. In contrast, an average of 18 people have been killed in New York's subways in each of the last five years.
Japan has been traumatized by the terrorist attack, but that is partly because people here are so accustomed to safety. Japanese have rarely had to worry about the killings and muggings that Americans fret about even in the best of times.
Last year 38 people were shot to death in all of Japan. In the United States, an average of 44 people are shot to death each day -- in all, more than 16,000 gun homicides a year.
One measure of how life is more innocent in Japan is that the easiest place to steal money from is a police station. Anyone can go to a police box and, without showing identification, borrow the equivalent of $10 or $20 for transportation home.
"We can't ask them for I.D., because usually the reason they need to borrow cash is that they've lost their wallet," said Tokio Kunichika, chief of the police for the Tokyo rail system. "Basically we trust the people to return the money. And since it might not be convenient to come back here to return it, they can pay the loan back at their local police station."
The trust is perhaps understandable, in that Japan has only one-eighth as many thefts and burglaries as America. Japan, with 48 percent of the population of the United States, has one-twentieth as many killings, one-seventieth as many arson cases and one-three-hundredth as many robberies.
Crime statistics are, of course, notoriously unreliable, but academic studies suggest that underreporting is less a problem in Japan than in the United States. And if anything, the figures understate the differences: a typical Japanese crime is a pickpocketing, not a mugging, so the difference in the level of fear is even more stark than the statistics would suggest.
Japan's crime problems are now growing, but they are not spiraling out of control. For most of the postwar period, Japanese crime rates fell steadily. They bottomed in the 1970's and have been rising for about the last 15 years, but even now they are lower than they were in the late 1940's and the 1950's.
"There are special things about Japan, but we can learn from it," said Prof. David H. Bayley, an American criminologist at the State University of New York and author of a book about the police in Japan.
"The lack of crime doesn't have to do with eating with chopsticks or taking your shoes off when you enter a house," Professor Bayley added. Instead, he said, it has to do with Japan's gun policy, police system and emphasis on social propriety.
 
Prevention
Stopping Trouble Before It Starts
 One expert on Japan's criminal justice system is a lanky 19-year-old man with a round face, a shock of black hair and a long record of stealing from cars and homes. The young man lives in a halfway house in Mito, where he earlier spent a year in a juvenile detention home.
"I began to get in trouble in elementary school, when I was stealing money from my folks," the burglar said as he relaxed in a chair on the ground floor of his halfway house. "I left home, and I was hanging out and didn't have money. So I began stealing money from houses."
Every country has juvenile offenders, but in Japan they may have a greater chance of going straight.
In part this is because few young Japanese have drug problems. Japan vigorously cracks down on narcotics -- as Paul McCartney found in 1980 when he arrived in Japan for a concert tour and was arrested for possession of marijuana -- and illegal drugs are only a marginal problem in society.
Japan is also more likely than the United States to catch criminals. The proportion of crimes solved has been tumbling in Japan in recent years, but it is still 37 percent, compared with about 20 percent in the United States.
Burglary is also unattractive because it is not very lucrative. Japanese do not much like to buy second-hand goods, and the police keep a close eye on pawn shops. Anyone selling used goods in quantity gets a lot of police attention, and so there is not much of a secondary market for stolen goods.
In 1588 a warlord who pacified Japan, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, confiscated all swords and guns from ordinary citizens. Ever since then, ordinary Japanese have been pretty much barred from owning guns.
Outside the police, there are only 49 legal handguns in Japan, all belonging to marksmen. Even they cannot keep their guns at home but must deposit them at a shooting range.
Shotguns and a limited number of hunting rifles are allowed, but the owner must pass a rigorous licensing procedure and exam. This license must be renewed every three years -- another onerous procedure -- and so hunters do not lightly put up with the nuisance of owning a rifle.
As a result, there are about 425,000 guns in private hands in Japan, overwhelmingly shotguns and air rifles, and the number is dropping. In the United States, experts say, there may be 200 million guns.
Criminal gangs in Japan do have guns, smuggled from abroad, and they sometimes use them on one another in turf fights. But ordinary street criminals do not normally have access to guns, and a person caught with a loaded pistol can be imprisoned for 15 years, so a petty criminal would not be likely to carry one.
 
The Society
 Intact Families, Common Identity
 Whatever the debate about whether gun control saves lives -- and most Japanese think it does -- Japan's experience underscores the importance of intact families and a relatively egalitarian society.
Criminologists say Japan's small income gaps, low unemployment and common social identity (85 percent of Japanese define themselves as middle-class) contribute to a shared antipathy toward crime.
Among Japanese offenders, the same kinds of risk factors seem to be associated with crime as in the West -- particularly broken families. When a group of counselors was asked what they noticed about the juvenile offenders they worked with, they pointed to family backgrounds.
"It's common among those who come here that they have family problems when they grow up," said Yai Horie, a volunteer at a halfway house in Mito. "They don't have a mother, or a father, or they have only a stepmother, and they eventually become demoralized."
To the extent that broken families are connected with crime, Japan has a major advantage over the United States. By Western standards, Japanese families may often be dysfunctional -- because the father spends very little time at home with children -- but they are not broken.
Only 1.1 percent of Japanese children are born to unmarried mothers, for instance, while in the United States the figure is 30.1 percent.
What Americans call "family values" are rigorously inculcated in Japan. The value of good behavior, of fitting into a common society, is drummed into children from the moment they set off to first grade in identical school uniforms.
The version of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" that is repeated in Japan, for instance, does not end with Goldilocks fleeing after she has been discovered eating the bears' porridge and sleeping in their beds. Instead, she apologizes deeply, and she and the bears have a friendly lunch together.
 
The Sanction
 Making Criminals Feel Guilty
 The Japanese criminal justice system, like China's, places great emphasis on making criminals feel remorse. The idea is to create an environment where everyone agrees that crime is intolerable.
There is no plea bargaining as such in Japan, but criminals know that if they confess and seem penitent, then the police may let them off lightly. Likewise, prisoners are asked to write statements of remorse, and these can improve a convict's prospects of early release.
A 16-year-old gang member in Mito, for instance, had a clear record until one night two years ago, when gang members grew suspicious that another of their group was a spy for a rival gang. So they beat the victim and stomped on him, apparently intending to teach him a lesson. Instead, they killed him.
The 16-year-old was regarded by the police as genuinely horrified by what he had done, and they thought that he was so shaken by the experience that he would stay out of trouble. So he was sent to a juvenile detention center for just 18 months.
"While in detention, I learned about my crime and about my shortcomings," the gang member wrote in the "expression of remorse" in his file.
The authorities released the young man from the detention center at the end of his sentence, but with conditions: that he live with relatives in a new neighborhood, that he work steadily at a job that parole workers found for him in a machine tool factory and that he have no contact with gang members.
"As long as he has no relationship with the bad guys from his past, he'll be 100 percent O.K.," said Shinji Yamada, his counselor.
Of course, Japanese criminals are as shrewd as Americans in knowing when it pays to display remorse that they do not feel. But since the whole system is geared to emphasize that crime is wrong, there may be less room in Japan for an alternative culture in which crime is "cool." Japanese social workers, and criminals, say that even among burglars, theft is considered deviant behavior.
 
Conformity
Peer Pressure And Safe Streets
 Professor Bayley, author of the book about the Japanese police, "Forces of Order," said some criminologists believe that a sense of orderliness and propriety is important to create an environment where crime is not tolerated.
"That's Japan," he added. "It's wall-to-wall propriety."
In Japan, for instance, even college students dress neatly, and the police take their shoes off at the entrances when conducting raids on private homes. The police installed a video monitor at the door of the home of a top Government official, and so the official's wife now feels compelled to put on her makeup before taking out the garbage.
The social pressure to do things right creates a burden on those who fail to meet these standards, and it may explain Japan's high suicide rates -- 45 percent higher than America's. But the same social pressures may also help explain Japan's low crime rates.
While the West will never go as far as Japanese in creating a sense of propriety, Professor Bayley suggests that some Americans find the idea of greater orderliness attractive.
Permissiveness appears to be less fashionable in the United States these days, and school uniforms have made a small comeback in some areas. Likewise, the American enthusiasm for sending juvenile offenders to boot camp so they will learn to get up at dawn and make their beds reflects a Japanese-style interest in building discipline and orderliness.
 
The Police
Broad Authority And Harsh Jails
 In some respects, the difference between the law enforcement systems in Japan and the United States is not that it is harsher but that it is more authoritarian. Prison sentences are shorter than in America, for instance, and the prison population is minute by world standards.
For every 100,000 people, Japan has 37 prisoners, compared with 80 in Germany, 229 in Singapore, 519 in the United States and 558 in Russia. Escapes are almost nonexistent, and there appear to be few problems with prison gangs or rapes or assaults among prisoners.
The reason is that prisoners are sometimes kept in tiny, individual cells, and at times they are barred from talking to one another or even looking at one another.
"Prisoners can't hold a private conversation, even when they're working," said Nisaburo Sakata, who runs a counseling program in Mito for paroled prisoners. "If they just look at any women who happen to visit the prison, they're punished. So it's impossible to organize gangs in prisons."
Human Rights Watch, which is based in New York, published a report this year concluding that "prisoners in Japan experience routine violations of human rights." The report cited the case of a former prisoner who spent 12 years in prison entirely in isolation; even when she was taken out of her cell, the hallway would be cleared first.
To be sure, Japanese prisons seem to be less successful than the rest of the criminal justice system. The recidivism rate is higher in Japan than in the United States, meaning that if a Japanese adult does become a prisoner, he is more likely to return within five years than an American counterpart.
This may be because ex-convicts -- like the murderer who defrauded and then bludgeoned his neighbor -- are sometimes rejected even by their families, so they have no one to return to. In addition, many criminals are members of the underworld known as the Yakuza who have already made a career choice to become gangsters.
Not just prison guards but also the police in Japan have unusual authority by American standards. They can detain suspects for up to 21 days before bringing them to a judge, and in that period the police often conduct daily interrogations in which enormous pressure is put on detainees to confess.
Human Rights Watch and other critics say the anonymous interrogators sometimes rough up suspects and deprive them of food and water, as well as force them to stand in fixed positions for long periods. Partly because of these pressures, Japanese defendants are far more likely than Americans to admit crimes and plead guilty.
The police are also given much greater leeway than in America to question people on the street and search their pockets or bags. Japanese courts tend to defer to police judgments; in any case evidence can be admitted in court even if it turns out to have been seized illegally.
There is no question that these practices help in the fight against crime, but some people question whether they are worth it.
"I think that there is a lot that Japan has sacrificed for safety," said Koichi Miyazawa, a law professor at Keio University in Tokyo. "Safety has been achieved at the expense of freedom."
Kazue Akita, a criminal lawyer, acknowledged some ambivalence on the issue. "I'm afraid that people in Japan give too much power to the police," she said.
But she added that safety from crime is also necessary to maintain human rights. "It's really important for women to be able to walk on the street at night," she said. "There are problems of sexual discrimination in Japan, but at least women here can walk on the street at night."

HEADLINE: Politics and Science in the House

 BODY:
Unless its members have an attack of good sense, the House of Representatives will shortly reverse two decades of struggle to preserve the nation's valuable but diminishing wetlands. If it does so, it will be sacrificing sound science to political expediency and corporate lobbying. It will also be committing an act of supreme mischief against America's environment.
Early this week the House will vote on a bill concocted by a group of anti-regulatory Republicans and their conservative Democratic allies. The bill would cripple many of the basic protections provided by the Clean Water Act of 1972. This act has been regarded by experts in both parties as a major environmental success story, not least because it has rescued one-third of America's lakes and streams from terminal decline. 
 There is much in this retrograde bill to dislike, but the most controversial of its "reforms" would establish a new and far narrower definition of what constitutes a wetland. Scientists now estimate that there are just over 100 million acres of wetlands remaining in the 48 contiguous states, doing what wetlands do so well: filtering pollutants, providing habitat for wildlife and nourishing organisms essential to the food chain. The bill's narrower definition would make at least half of this irreplaceable acreage available to developers, farmers and industry, mainly the oil and gas companies.
This is a fool's tradeoff. We would lose natural areas the country desperately needs in exchange for development areas the economy can do without. Yet the tradeoff is hardly surprising since the bill was drafted in tandem with special interests that would love to get their hands on land that is properly off limits under existing Federal regulations.
Equally unsurprising, though terribly disappointing, is that the bill's sponsors did not have the courage or wisdom to wait for and acknowledge the results of a National Academy of Sciences report on what is, admittedly, a combustible issue. The report was ordered by Congress itself two years ago to provide a credible scientific basis for regulating wetlands, thus removing the issue from politics. But in matters of the environment, the hallmark of this new Congress is to place servility to special interests ahead of science.
The report, released last week, does not directly address the House bill. Even so, it is a convincing indictment, making clear that the bill's assumptions have no basis in research or theory.
To take only one example, the bill says a wetland would not be eligible for Federal protection unless it is saturated by water at the surface for 21 consecutive days during the growing season -- the warmer and drier months of the year. The academy says a far more accurate definition would involve saturation over shorter periods, saturation in the root zone of plants rather than at the surface, and saturation that occurs during the fall and winter.
The 21-day test is the same definition that Dan Quayle's Competitiveness Council tried unsuccessfully to foist on the Environmental Protection Agency in the waning days of the Bush Administration. At the time, Federal scientists warned that Mr. Quayle's definition would leave half the nation's wetlands unprotected, including a big chunk of the Everglades, the bottomland hardwood forests in the South, the wetlands along most Western trout streams and nearly every "prairie pothole" used by migratory birds. This disastrous scenario is almost certain to play out if the House bill is approved. Taken together, its provisions are even more threatening than anything Mr. Quayle had in mind.
The academy describes the existing regulatory system as "scientifically sound and effective in most respects." What it is really saying is that the nation has already struck a sensible balance between the imperatives of conservation and the need for economic growth. That balance has taken years to achieve, and the House would be reckless to disturb it.

Gingrich Family Values

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
"Why do we have all these problems we didn't have in 1955?" asked Newt Gingrich rhetorically last Sunday on "Meet the Press." Tim Russert had just asked the Speaker to defend his incendiary past statements linking Susan Smith's infanticide and Woody Allen's sex life to the platforms of the Democratic Party. Mr. Gingrich held firm, attributing America's post-1955 social decay to "a long pattern of counterculture belief . . . deep in the Democratic Party" that had "undervalued the family" and "consistently favored alternative life styles."
May we go back to 1955 for a moment? Mr. Gingrich, who prides himself on knowing history, might profit from checking out modern scholarship on the 50's. He would then learn -- if he doesn't in fact remember -- that the halcyon pre-counterculture era of the Eisenhower Presidency was not all "Father Knows Best" and sunny Norman Rockwell family tableaux for The Saturday Evening Post. 
 As Stephanie Coontz documents in "The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap" (Basic Books, 1992), teen-age birth rates in the 1950's set record highs that remain unsurpassed even now. By 1955, the number of out-of-wedlock babies placed for adoption had increased by 80 percent from a decade earlier. Tranquilizers, a new line of drugs devised for understandably anxious women, rose from obscurity in 1955 to a total consumption level of 462,000 pounds in 1958 and 1.15 million pounds by 1959.
As many as a third of 50's marriages ended in divorce -- as Mr. Gingrich's parents' marriage had (and his own first marriage later would). In 1956, McCall's magazine set a readership record with an article titled "The Mother Who Ran Away"; in 1959, it dropped its cover slogan, "The Magazine of Togetherness."
The truth about the 50's is that all the post-World War II fissures in American life were present and simply papered over -- with the aid of racial segregation, the denial of equal social and economic status to women, the repression of homosexuals and the refusal to recognize crimes like wife battering and child abuse. It was inevitable that this phony nirvana would crack at the seams, as it did in the 60's.
Even in the 50's, the Speaker might recall, the signs were there. In his wonderful year of 1955, Congress considered nearly 200 bills related to juvenile delinquency; the juveniles themselves were more likely to be watching "Rebel Without a Cause" or "The Blackboard Jungle" than "Boys Town." If America were such a picture-postcard of familial bliss in 1955, there would have been no reason to create Disneyland, which also opened that year -- with one of its chief attractions being an idyllic all-American (and all-white) Main Street that could no longer be found beyond its gates. A year later came "Peyton Place."
So what is Mr. Gingrich's political game? To understand that, it's helpful to see how much his language demonizing a Democratic counterculture for society's current ills parrots a recent fund-raising letter from Pat Robertson's and Ralph Reed's Christian Coalition, which will unveil its "Contract With the American Family" this week. Purporting to speak on behalf of what he calls "America's 40,000,000 Christian voters," Mr. Robertson writes that "we need a second Contract with America -- one that focuses on reversing the ruinous moral decay and social breakdown caused by a 30-year war the radical Left has waged against the traditional family and America's religious heritage."
This Christian Coalition contract, carefully withheld until the new Congress's second 100 days, is the long-awaited bill the religious right is now handing to the Republican Congress in exchange for its support in '94 and its continued support in '96. It's safe to assume that its planks will call for bringing back some official form of school prayer, limiting abortion, eliminating sex education and instituting "school choice." All of which are code phrases for turning back the clock to 1955 -- when the rights of religious minorities went unprotected, when teen-age girls had back-alley abortions, when women were expected to be seen but not heard, when homosexuals stayed in the closet and when de facto segregation ruled in the nation's schools.
Ah, the good old days! Leave it to Newt Gingrich, America's most selective and powerful historian, to do his best to make history repeat itself.

HEADLINE: Japan Won't Take a Trade Back Seat Anymore

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I read with interest your May 8 Business Day news analysis on auto issues, and wish to respond specifically to the comment by Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, on Japan's "hypocritical" attitude on managed trade. 
 Mr. Kantor said that by rejecting the United States demands to have Japanese automakers commit to increasing their purchase of imported auto parts, the Japanese negotiators "are not only being hypocritical." But they are also "being inconsistently hypocritical" because Japan in the past agreed to restrict exports to the United States and Europe.
Despite much talk about a new phase in our bilateral economic relations, this statement suggests the United States still prefers its traditional approach to Japan. It wants Japan, and its Ministry of International Trade and Industry in particular, to go back to the bad old days of voluntary restraint arrangements.
Voluntary restraint arrangements were often the deus ex machina in the final phase of past Japan-United States trade negotiations, such as on textiles, color television sets, steel, machine tools, semiconductors, as well as on automobiles. But we now think voluntary restraint arrangements were a bad idea and have no place in the trading system.
Countries of the world have expended great effort to move toward freer trade through the Uruguay Round and the establishment of the World Trade Organization. Voluntary restraint arrangements and other "gray area" measures are explicitly prohibited under the new W.T.O. rules on safeguards, because they are nothing but efforts to manage trade by regulating trade flows.
Mr. Kantor just does not seem to realize how far Japan has come into fully embracing the principle of free trade based on multilateral rules and disciplines. If "the centerpiece of Mr. Clinton's economic strategy has been encouraging free trade with the world's biggest emerging markets," Mr. Kantor and his colleagues should immediately terminate their futile effort to turn back the clock.

HEADLINE: Japan Won't Take a Trade Back Seat Anymore;
Buchanan's Doctrine

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Patrick J. Buchanan's eloquent call (Op-Ed, May 10) for closing United States markets to Japan because of our bilateral trade deficit is a clear statement of his doctrine of "economic nationalism." This is the new label for classical protectionism. The opinion pollster Frank Luntz has discovered that most Americans disapprove of protectionism, but nationalism is still popular, and not just among conservatives. 
 The central concept of economic nationalism is the belief that there is only one American national interest in trade. The expression of this error is always associated with the words "we," or "our" national interest.
This idea of "one national interest" sometimes takes the form of "exports are good, and imports are bad." Although only some Americans sell products to foreigners, those are "our exports." Sometimes it takes the form, "Americans ought to buy from other Americans instead of from foreigners." Mr. Buchanan cites our trade deficit to justify protecting us from "imports."
In a country of more than 100 million working families, there are 100 million different manifestations of America's economic national interest. The belief that our interest is definable in a singular way is destructive of the principles on which our free market system is built, because that would justify regulating the economy in ways that bestow privileges on some Americans at the expense of other Americans.
Political leaders should not sell themselves to some Americans and hope most other Americans will not understand the logical fallacies they so eloquently employ.

HEADLINE: Have You Hugged Your Computer Today?

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
MY NAME is David. I am afraid of my computer.
When people talk about Unix accounts, web sites and bulletin board chats, I need an interpreter. When people talk about surfing, downloading and upgrading, I pine for gerunds like reading, writing and talking. 
 But when my mom, a children's librarian, receives an invitation to a conference on "Internet: Highway to Cities of Multimedia and Chinese Resources," I want to say: "Time out! What about me?"
It's a woolly world out there, this global electronic village populated by preschoolers who can navigate computers with their eyes closed and on-line fanatics who spend eight hours a day chatting with people they've never seen.
Me, I just cling to an imaginary security blanket to allay my electronic anxieties. Clearly I need some help.
"For some reason, new technology produces this irrational fear that everybody knows it but you," said Dr. Trudy Williams, a consultant in technical writing and developmental psychology at Nynex Science and Technology in White Plains, N.Y.
"Maybe you're a 56-year-old executive and suddenly you're not as good as the 18-year-old down the block," she explained. "You feel that after investing some time in building self-esteem and gaining equality, you are thrown back to that isolated peak in the middle of the ocean that you have so diligently swum away from."
There are, of course, those who say that all this "information superhighway" talk will turn out to be a lot of bunkum, or at least that it's possible to lead a perfectly rewarding life without even the occasional day trip to cyberspace. But even so, Dr. Williams and others in the computer community try to assure me, going on line really doesn't have to be scary or difficult. The World Wide Web may sound like nothing more than a place to get hopelessly lost, but, for starters, there are all manner of places to go that are quintessentially local, whose world is the web of everyday life right here in New Jersey.
"Remember that a human being put this together, therefore a human being can learn it by doing it one step at a time," counseled Dr. Williams.
Still, can that really include me, David the technophobe, who shunned math and science classes in college except for ones with nicknames like "Physics for Poets" and "Rocks for Jocks"? Who worked for a couple of years in Silicon Valley and stared blankly as people talked high-tech and E-mail? Who once called the people at America Online to report that something was wrong with their trial software -- only to be told that I had failed to connect the modem to a phone line?
But I'm willing to try again. After all, as many as 40 million people have electronic mail access globally, 90 percent of them in North America, said Jill Ellsworth, author of a book called "Marketing on the Internet." In New Jersey, she and others estimated, perhaps a million people are wired.
To get going, I checked out a weekend computer show at William Paterson College in Wayne. Maybe it wasn't the best idea for me; there were too many products and too many people. I found a kindred spirit, however, in Frank Pondelick, a retired gentleman from Paterson who, like me, was staring at computer disks with arms folded and eyebrows furrowed.
"I'd like to get involved with the Internet just to keep up with the world, but this is too confusing for me, the whole mass of everything," he said. "If you want to learn it, you really got to sit down and learn it."
I asked some friends for help. Eventually, I found Fred LaParo, who runs an Internet access provider in Stanhope. His advice? "Make sure you make nice with your PC geek buddy for a week to help you get connected."
Simple enough. I asked Fred and two more of a growing corps of on-line entrepreneurs -- who aren't geeks, by the way -- to guide me on my way. Here's what I found.
 
John Kelley
I.D. System operator of MicroFone InfoService, a bulletin board system, in Metuchen.
BEGINNINGS Mr. Kelley, who is 52 years old, taught himself computers as a release after the death of his first wife in 1981. He has operated MicroFone since 1982, and now teaches computers at John Adams Middle School in Edison.
Bulletin boards, by and large, are the slow lane of the on-line world, typically small, local operations with features like electronic mail, discussion groups, file transfers and games. Many bulletin boards are the province of teen-agers; they are also a good place for novices like me to start.
Like most bulletin board system operators (known as sys-ops), John Kelley runs MicroFone InfoService out of his basement. Calling it crowded is an understatement: The room is filled with four computers, 32 phone lines, a scanner, modems, CD-ROM's and shelves of books and software packages.
"For your basic user, you only need a computer, a modem, a phone line, bulletin board software and the phone number of a local bulletin board so you don't have to pay long-distance charges," he said. "Get someone to help you set up, if you need that."
I sat down at the main computer and dialed Mr. Kelley's own bulletin board, which he describes as "a family, G-rated board" that offers everything from computer games to the weather to information about goings on at Rutgers. The instructions were pretty simple: Basically, the program asked my name, phone number and other personal details.
I typed in my name, and the entry was promptly rejected. Could it be me?
"Oops. There's another user named David Chen," Mr. Kelley said, taking control of the keyboard for a second. "He's in Plainfield. Well, I'll be. We'll just have to use another name."
It worked the second time under DW Chen. I was in; I was psyched.
From there, Mr. Kelley guided me to various chat groups and games. It really wasn't that hard; I just followed the directions. Later, I dialed the New JerseyLand board in Neptune. It was similar to Mr. Kelley's in that it asked several preliminary questions and offered message groups, games and personal ads, real estate listings and a teen-age chat forum featuring the latest in juvenile macho posturing.
Mr. Kelley compiles a monthly list of the state's bulletin boards for New Jersey Computer User magazine. He estimates that there are 60,000 boards in the country, 500 of them in New Jersey.
His own bulletin board holds a monthly on-line auction. Once, someone tried to sell his wife for two cents. "I knocked that one out of the system," he said in disgust. But another time, Mr. Kelley and other MicroFone subscribers raised money for a fellow sys-op's bone-marrow transplant.
 
Fred LaParo
I.D. Senior partner, Planet Access Networks.
BEGINNINGS Mr. LaParo, 40, worked in telecommunications and information services for about 15 years. He became interested in the Internet a few years ago because, he says, he was fascinated with its possibilities.
I felt pretty good after leaving Mr. Kelley's house. It didn't seem that difficult to dial in to a local bulletin board, get on line and start sending messages or playing games. But what about the Internet, and the vaunted World Wide Web?
For this I turned back to Mr. LaParo, who co-founded Planet Access Networks in March 1994. It is an Internet access provider, or a link between your computer and the Internet, the world's largest collection of computer networks. Many people tap into the on-line world through the national services -- America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, Delphi and Netcom. But around the country, there are also hundreds of smaller, local providers like Planet Access, which are somewhat harder to use but promise greater freedom to explore the Internet.
Mr. LaParo first instructed me to get the appropriate software. Packages like "Internet in a Box" or the "Internet Starter Kit" work just fine, for example. He then walked me through the basic steps of configuring the computer -- setting the right modem speed and other technical details to insure that everything is in synch. This part can be tricky, so it's best to make sure your access provider has dependable customer service.
I logged onto Mr. LaParo's computer and found myself staring at icons named Netscape and Eudora. Eudora is the gateway for electronic mail; Netscape searches for files on the World Wide Web, a major chunk of the Internet. I clicked on Netscape, and found myself at Planet Access's home page -- the welcome mat to the Internet.
As with the bulletin boards, the instructions were fairly self-explanatory; I basically moved the mouse around to click on text highlighted in blue, called hypertext, to get more information. Point, click, point, click. That's all.
"The surfing aspect is you hit one place and it takes you someplace else," he said. "You find one thing and you find 100 things behind that."
You can also search for information by using tools that cross-reference words and phrases. Searching for the combination of "Jersey" and "sushi," for example, produces a web page on the state's best sushi bars.
It may take me awhile to figure things out. After all, the web is expanding at a ridiculous pace, according to Howard Funk, an Internet consultant who participated in a seminar on New Jersey and the Internet at Kean College last week. In 1993, there were only 50 web addresses worldwide; in January 1995, there were 27,000.
Planet Access's web site, for example, provides on-line access to certain newspapers, as well as Internet updates, stock quotes, weather forecasts, entertainment news, even a daily comic. And on June, it will offer the Jersey Mall, a directory of businesses around the state.
To Mr. LaParo, going on line seems like a very New Jersey thing to do. "It's the mentality of the suburbs," he said. "People nest out here, and the net is the ultimate nesting place. You cocoon down in the evening with your PC and your modem."
That way, if I flounder, at least I'll flounder alone.
 
Karen Schneider
I.D. Proprietor of Blue Highways Internet Services, a home-office consulting business, in Wayne.
BEGINNINGS Ms. Schneider, 37, became computer literate only a few years ago during graduate school at the University of Illinois. She worked in electronic resources at the Queens and Newark Public Libraries before starting her own business last August.
Next up, a talk with Karen Schneider about what I could do with these tools to find New Jersey information.
Ms. Schneider calls herself a "cybrarian," an on-line librarian who helps individuals, businesses and non-profit organizations connect to and learn about the Internet. She runs Blue Highway off a Macintosh Powerbook in a spare bedroom in her home.
Her own web page, "Welcome to Karen's Kitchen: A Virtual Cafe in Wayne, N.J.," is essentially a cyberspace hangout, divided into categories (marked by coffee mugs) like NJ Delicacies, Librarian Stuff and The Intellectual Freedom Page. Oh, and I can't forget Darcy the Cat, which lets you hear the lovely meow of Ms. Schneider's 17-year-old pet.
Under NJ Delicacies, I found listings for the Amateur Computer Group of New Jersey, the Prototype Home Page for the Episcopal Diocese of Newark and a list of New Jersey internet providers. So far, so good.
Ms. Schneider said I could also use a popular web index called Yahoo to look for discussion groups, called newsgroups, about New Jersey (or any other topic, like "Melrose Place" or the N.B.A. playoffs). And she directed me to a couple of new sites still being tested, NJ On-Line and IN Jersey. The former is run by Newhouse Newspapers, the parent company of The Star-Ledger; the latter by The Asbury Park Press. Both are designed to feature local news.
Ms. Schneider is a member of a discussion group called Spiderwoman, women who maintain web pages; she sees herself as something of a crusader for an underrepresented minority. Eighty to 90 percent of Internet users are men, she estimates; hence, she points out, the problem of sexual harassment -- she received a vulgar E-mail message recently and has tracked its writer to a school "west of the Mississippi."
Right now, I'm struggling with the jargon. Try to make sense of this: "I'm surfing the web and browsing some hot links from somebody's home page so I find some cool HTMLs."
"Just go ahead and ask," said Ms. Schneider. "With the net, don't expect to learn it all in one day. Have patience and persevere and log-on late at night."
I was on my own, not exactly confident, but pride-bound to press on. Borrowing the computer of a colleague, I relied on the Yahoo index to find something called the Unofficial Home Page of New Jersey, put out by someone at Ohio State University. It contained information about each of New Jersey's 21 counties, and more. In the Hoboken area, for instance, I found restaurant listings, complete with addresses, phone numbers and recommendations.
I then used Yahoo to see how many New Jersey discussion groups there were. I counted about a dozen, including ones about politics, for-sale items, weather and events. Digging deeper into each newsgroup, I found people discussing speeding tickets, meetings for young Jewish singles and the absence of self-serve gas stations.
One thing I didn't find was anything offered by the state government. Indeed, on-line users have long complained about the state as being behind the curve on providing on-line data. The state has promised to do so soon, but I haven't found it yet.
There's more to come, including NJPIX (North Jersey Public Information Exchange), a nonprofit organization that is connecting schools and libraries in North Jersey. The idea is to provide local information for people in places like Newark and Elizabeth "to provide opportunities for economic and social empowerment," said Paul Pattwell, chairman of NJPIX.
It all sounded good, but I still wasn't sure. So I checked with Adam C. Engst, author of "The Internet Starter Kit," to see if he could offer a little sympathy, or, at least, understanding. I even E-mailed the man.
His response: "Fear is silly. If you don't want to get on the net, don't. But if you do, just do it -- you have to experience the net for what it is and make up your own mind about whether or not you like it," he typed. "Hope this helps. Cheers."
It did, Mr. Engst, and thanks. I'm still intimidated, but I think I can safely say that I am no longer paralyzed. Check back with me in a few months, though.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Can the Republicans Really Help the Cities?

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON; Iver Peterson is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
One of the jokes told at the annual dinner of the Legislative Correspondents Club Wednesday night went like this: "If Governor Whitman put a few more dollars into her urban program, it would cost as much as her house."
The line hardly stretches the truth: Governor Whitman said she would put up all of $2 million in state seed money for urban neighborhood improvement when she disclosed her urban self-help strategy in March, which is about enough money for an entry-level estate in the horse country, where the Governor lives. It is a measure of how desperate some of New Jersey's cities are that many mayors acted grateful for the Governor's idea. 
 Few states have contrived as well as New Jersey has to disconnect the lives of most residents from the problems of the cities. We have no urban giants, like New York City or Philadelphia, with the population and the votes to throw their weight around in the Legislature.
Instead there are a half-dozen old medium-size factory towns and two dozen small pockets of decay scattered around the state. For most New Jerseyans, the problems these places have -- unemployment, rotten housing, crime, awful schools -- exist as abstractions, except for the attendance checkers suburban school districts post at the curb each day to monitor the license plates of cars dropping off kids, lest some city dweller manage to sneak a child across the line.
So it is interesting that some of the boldest ideas percolating to the surface of the urban policy debate these days are coming from Republicans, in a state where "city" has meant "Democrat" since Paterson dipped its first bolt of silk in a vat of dye.
Brett Schundler, the youthful and Republican Mayor of Jersey City, is trying to apply free market theory to school choice on the principle that the cities will live and die on the quality of their schools. After first backing him on an experimental free-choice voucher program, Mrs. Whitman backed off, for a year at least, to give the subject more reflection.
Mr. Schundler felt betrayed but hardly defeated, and last Thursday he was back in Trenton, touting a plan for charter schools, which operate independently and with specialized curriculums. It is at least something he can do without permission from Trenton.
The other Republican urban theoretician is Senator Dick LaRossa, whose 15th District includes Trenton. A one-time lottery announcer, Mr. LaRossa is not, admittedly, old-line G.O.P. He chose his party the day of the filing deadline in 1991, and has been something of a loose cannon in the tidy ranks of New Jersey's Republicans ever since.
But when you represent one third of the Republicans' three-vote majority in the Senate, even a nonconformist can find an audience, and Mr. LaRossa is trying to get his to listen to him about the cities. In a state that already has committees for veterans and for women's issues, Mr. LaRossa prevailed on Senate leadership to create the Legislature's first committee on urban policy and planning, and had himself installed as chairman.
"We're getting hammered on this question, this idea that the Republican Party doesn't care about the citiies," Mr. La Rossa said the other day, as he sat in his district office in Ewing, outside of Trenton. "We're allowing the other party to run away with the cities because we let people think we don't care."
To be fair, Mrs. Whitman is something of a softie when it comes to spending money directly on people who live in the cities, as opposed to bricks and mortar. Under pressure from the courts, she increased state aid to urban schools by $30 million this year and proposes to add another $100 million in the coming fiscal year, and she has refused to follow some of her fellow Republican governors in cutting welfare programs.
But the Governor's urban policy is essentially one of atmospherics, getting neighborhoods to improve themselves enough to attract private investment. Mr. LaRossa's take on the cities is fundamentally different, and focuses on employment first and uplift later.
"If we can lower the barriers to investment in the cities, and if we can show that investment will be profitable, we can do something besides talk about the problem," Mr. LaRossa said. "It's not like a field of dreams, if we build another industrial park, they will come. But if we can show businesses they can be profitable, they will come. The bottom line is still the bottom line."
Mr. LaRossa's Urban Redevelopment Act would empower a new state agency to force owners of closed city factories to get back into business or sell their properties to someone else. Besides the usual tax abatements for start-up industries, he wants a newly created Urban Development Authority to issue bonds to help new businesses start up, along with faster approval of the necessary licenses to operate factories.
There are still plenty of gaps in all this. Aren't many old factories so heavily polluted that businesses won't touch them, for fear of getting stuck with cleanup costs? Mr. LaRossa will offer technical help to make them touchable. Isn't one of the reasons businesses settle in the suburbs their aversion to the crime and despair of the cities? New jobs will lift the pall and pathology of poverty. And aren't factory jobs vanishing nationwide? Mr. LaRossa breathes the prayer of economic development gurus everywhere: "High tech."
The plan has picked up considerable attention among free-market strategists in Washington, and Governor Whitman's staff is working with the Senator on some of the plan's details. In a state that has made the cities and the cities' problems almost invisible, Mr. LaRossa is at least spinning ideas, including his strategy for selling his plan to the suburban-dominated Legislature: appeal to self-interest.
"The suburbs are already paying for the cities' problems, for education, for Medicaid, for welfare," he said recently. "And the cities' problems are already moving outwards. Crime was never an issue when it was a city issues, but now it's coming out to the suburbs. That's what's got people's attention."

As the state government and its cities and towns scramble to make do with less in the aftermath of Governor Whitman's income tax cuts, another major source of revenue is shrinking much more quietly but almost as fast: the taxes paid by the seven big utility companies that supply most of the state's electricity and natural gas. And that drop, in turn, is stirring a debate about how -- and whether -- to prop up the revenue.
Treasury officials are predicting that next year the state will lose at least $85 million in revenue from the gross receipts and franchise tax, which is collected from the seven companies regulated by the State Board of Public Utilities. The tax, which amounts to more than $1 billion this year, is second only to property taxes as a source of revenue for municipal budgets. As recently as 1992, it brought in $1.5 billion. 
 The seven major utilities pay the 13.5 percent tax instead of local property taxes, to compensate for the use of public land for water mains, power and gas lines and other purposes. The revenue is shrinking because more and more businesses are buying electricity and gas from the utilities' competitors, which don't have to pay the utility tax: out-of-state companies and alternative energy producers, called co-generators because they generate steam and power as a byproduct of industrial processes.
By law, the state keeps about $250 million and passes $685 million to the municipalities. If there is extra revenue, it goes to the municipalities, and this year that figure is $85 million. But because of increased competition from the other suppliers, treasury officials have warned that the municipalities should not expect such a surplus next year. As more commercial and industrial customers buy energy from the alternative suppliers, the utilities say they are losing millions of dollars a year and therefore paying less in taxes to the municipalities. And they say their competitors get a built-in advantage because they don't have to pay the 13.5 percent tax.
"The large utilities don't mind paying the tax, but from a competitive standpoint they're getting killed," said William Dressel, assistant executive director of the League of Municipalities, the umbrella group of local governments. "It's only fair that these other companies get taxed, too."
But those suppliers point out that they pay a corporate business tax that the utilities are exempt from. They provide about 12 percent of the state's electricity and gas.
Sarah Beavers, a spokeswoman for the Board of Public Utilities, says the more substantial loss of revenue is to out-of-state gas companies that do not pay the utilities tax. The deregulation of the gas industry several years ago enabled commercial customers to buy their gas out of state. The board will soon consider whether to deregulate the electricity industry as well, which leaves some politicians worrying that the loss of tax revenue will get far worse.
"You don't have to look far in your crystal ball to see the same thing happening with electricity," said Senator Jack Sinagra, a Republican from Middlesex County who has been studying the deregulation issue since 1988. "This is just the beginning of a problem that's going to escalate unless we address it right away."
Donald Linky, president of the Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey, which studies tax policy, said the deregulation of the energy industry begged the question of whether the tax should continue to exist at all. "In my view, the tax has been a deterrent to economic development in New Jersey," he said.
Last month, the Treasury Department and Board of Public Utilities heard from politicians and officials from the energy suppliers at three public hearings. The Treasury Department has said that it will make a decision by the end of June about whether to recommend changes in the tax.
"If we don't plug that leak, it's going to hit everyone's pocketbook," said Mr. Dressel, of the League of Municipalities. "The worst-case scenario is right around the corner."

Thank You for Not Smoking (as if You Had a Choice)

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
FORGET "STAR TREK," "STAR Wars," "2001." No outer-space adventure is as fascinating as the spatial dramas that take place right here on earth. New York City's tough new anti-smoking laws are a case in point. Push comes to shove a million times a minute in New York, but a new kind of territorial dispute doesn't come along every day. And the anti-smoking laws have made dining out an excellent refresher course in the dynamics of the territorial impulse and its impact on urban space.
The first day the laws went into effect, April 10, I had dinner at a downtown Manhattan restaurant that has always attracted a lot of smokers. It was shocking to see the room without smoke. You could actually see the ceiling, which, it turned out, had benefited from that low cloud cover. The paint was blotchy. You could also see the faces of diners halfway across the room in clear, seemingly magnified detail. Some of them had blotchy make-up. People looked uncomfortably exposed without their pale wrapper of haze. Smoke kills, but it can also lend enchantment. 
 As I was sitting there it occurred to me that smokers could argue that this is a freedom of religion issue. It has been proved that secondhand smoke is a health hazard, so in this sense the anti-smoking laws are based on science. But they also reveal the extent to which science can invite the projection of religious attitudes. In this case, it projects a good cover for Puritan morality.
Perhaps, like the American Indians who have received special exemption from drug laws because their sacred rites include the ingestion of hallucinogenic cactus buttons, smokers should start a cult, something like the First Church of Nights Out on the Town. Many of them are already devout worshipers at the altar of urban sophistication. Select restaurants could be their temples. Cigarettes could be marketed as incense sticks, to be brandished aloft over hot gossip and frosty Ketel One vodka martinis.
And if the ruse works, the concept could be expanded to include multinational corporations. Industries could fight air quality regulations on the grounds that they're not really belching pollution: they're conducting the solemn ritual of economic growth. Or polluters could claim exemption on esthetic grounds. They're creating atmosphere. Think how barren nocturnal New York would be without the steam that comes hissing from the manhole covers. As a friend once commented, with more than a touch of civic pride, the streets steam in New York because the city is so close to hell.
Besides compelling some restaurateurs to install partitions between the dining room and the bar, the anti-smoking law won't have much impact on architecture. Still, as an assertion of territoriality -- the right of some people to control a space and to let other people know that they don't -- the smoking ban is a good illustration of the social displacement that defines the city today.
Saskia Sassen, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University, has used the phrase "culture of eviction" to describe the reigning dynamic in the city now. The term doesn't refer only to the homeless. It refers to suburban children who know that they'll never be able to afford a house as nice as the one they grew up in. It refers to the struggling artist who discovers that the city no longer offers marginal living conditions to creative people. It refers even to the middle-class family working just to hold onto a little space and their dignity. Beyond that, it refers to the global migration from poor countries into large American cities and to the social displacement of those left out of the global-information economy.
Architecture doesn't drive the culture of eviction, but it plays a big role within it. Architects not only put up edifices; they also create images that conceal the magnitude of the displacement that is occurring. This is probably the big story of architecture in the 1980's. This was a decade when real-estate developers discovered the virtues of quality architecture, when architects learned to be sensitive to the urban context, when post-modernists showed themselves willing to accommodate tradition and popular taste.
AT THE SAME TIME, THIS WAS A period when housing costs skyrocketed, when homelessness became the new term for destitution, when the middle class could no longer take for granted the dream-house incarnation of the American dream. While architecture was promoting continuity with the past, society was experiencing a rupture with it. New housing developments began to simulate their surroundings esthetically while transforming them socially. While buildings appealed to popular taste, fewer people could afford them. Architecture, in other words, functioned as a smokescreen, an enchanting facade of stability that masked our rapid transformation into a society of virtual nomads.
The situation had those who write about architecture in a bind. We write about the look of buildings because it's expected of us and because we like it; we think form matters. Who were we to criticize real-estate developers for becoming more sophisticated about design? Yet at a certain point it became imperative to look further upstream toward the social and economic forces that bring buildings into being. Perhaps that point arrived with the end of the cold war, and the pressure it created to reexamine a society in which some people enjoyed park views while others slept in the park.
Architects have no choice but to work within the culture of eviction. Their livelihood depends on keeping it going. But they do have the capacity to decide how best to reckon with it. They can choose to mask it, substituting symbols of stability for the real thing. They can devise new forms that celebrate nomadism as a liberating force of contemporary life. Or (like Frank LLoyd Wright) they can respond to the creative challenge of mediating between these extremes.
No one has proposed legislation outlawing free enterprise. On the contrary, the political climate today favors the further relaxation of regulations that try to compensate for its defects. Nonetheless, the economic slump of the past few years has clarified the options architects face. It has cleared away a lot of smoke.

HEADLINE: Fostering Clean Air Through Environmental Law

BYLINE: By ERIKA DUNCAN 

 BODY:
I THINK everyone is born with a curiosity about nonhuman creatures," Charles Wurster said. "If it isn't an ant or a spider, it might be an elephant in the zoo. Everyone is born without fear of snakes and spiders."
It was Easter Sunday, which seemed an appropriate time for two strangers to meet, so that I could learn about the sequence of events that led to the banning of DDT nationwide and the founding of the Environmental Defense Fund. 
 Now the story is 30 years old, the "fearsome foursome," the young scientists who began it all, are three and their hair is very white. They are just as impatient about the plight of the natural world as they were 30 years ago, just as unable to wait, although their organization now has a membership of 300,000, a $25 million budget, and is still steadily growing.
The words echo: "What? You don't have a plan? No five-year plan?" the early trustees used to say. "You haven't chosen priorities?"
"We knew what our goal was." But the route remained flexible, as it still does today, despite the organization's large size. "New people would pop up, or the situation would change. We went up many blind alleys, and then backed off and went in a different direction.
"People think of things a government can't think of. Not having a plan leaves the way open for a great deal of innovation among all of the participants, even, often, for those on the other side."
He was speaking about how the Clean Air Act of 1990 exemplified this, specifying an amount and a time frame for cutting sulphur dioxide emissions without giving mandates about how it might be accomplished, so that those who were able to cut their pollution easily by 75 percent were able to sell their rights to those who could only cut it by 25 percent. Here, the goal, the 50 percent cut, was clearly more important to Charles Wurster than an arbitrary and even distribution.
He was speaking of the "win/win" situation with the McDonald's hamburger chain, how the staff of his organization worked flipping hamburgers, predicting that waste could be cut by 80 percent. Waste already has been cut by 75 percent and McDonald's has become an active collaborator.
As birds -- the best adapted to our earth as it is meant to be because they exist equally in land and sea and sky -- became the best barometer for the ills of the environment, so the successful banning of DDT, first in 1966 in Suffolk County and then later in Michigan (where dieldrin and aldrin were added) and then in Wisconsin, became the catalyst that broke through the "standing barrier" in which an individual was unable to press charges in court on behalf of a bird or a whale or the sky.
It brought into being a way of approaching environmental issues that would herald results more immediate than those of the most eloquent editorials and scientific reports, a collaboration of scientists and lawyers that inaugurated the now well-accepted entire field of environmental law.
There was a clear feeling of renewal outside, and although we were sitting indoors I felt that there was no distinction between dining room table and forest outside. The forest was just gathering its green, and beyond it one could see onto and over the salt marsh and onto and over the bay, to the tan of a sand bar, and then in the distance still farther the hills around Bridgeport, Conn.
Silhouetted against the glass that made up the front wall was a single dark telescope on a tripod. For Charles Wurster was starting to lead eco-tours in his approaching retirement and he found that, for the inexperienced, binoculars were tricky; they wasted all of their time focussing, instead of enjoying the birds.
And it seemed that the birds, still invisible to me in the forest, were in waiting on that day.
A man in a red and black flannel shirt, sitting at a slight diagonal against the floor-to-ceiling glass. You notice the little things when a person talks to you. The first thing I noticed was that Charles Wurster hardly ever said "I." He always said "we."
A week and a half later there would be a conference hosted by the Marine Sciences Research Center at Stony Brook, honoring "Charlie" on his retirement and celebrating the return of the osprey to Long Island, even naming that day, the 25th of April, in his honor. Needless to say, already he was fretting about being singled out in what was so clearly a collaborative story.
It was only when he was talking about boyhood beginnings before the life-long collaboration began that he was willing to use the word "I."
"When I was 6 and lived outside Philadelphia I came across a snake," he said, returning to inborn curiosity about the nonhuman world."Now I know it was a garter. I killed it. This was the enemy, but it fascinated me. Gradually my interest spread to turtles. I remember going out in row boats and catching them. By the age of 10 or 11, I was catching rattlesnakes and copperheads."
At the age of 16 he went to Germantown Friends' School "where," he said, "the naturalist Joseph Cadbury taught little kids all about birds and bees and the natural world."
"We would drive all night down to Florida and would camp in the Everglades. I would bring back the snakes that I caught in bags, and I would give them to the Philadelphia zoo. Most of the others were interested in birds, and after a while I would notice that if they saw 100 species of birds in a day, I would see two snakes. Somewhere along the line I made a checklist from memory of the birds I knew up to the point, and I found that I knew 200 species. It's been birds ever since."
A lot of forces converged so that he majored in chemistry -- "At the time biology didn't seem to be as serious a field. This was before DNA was discovered, don't forget" -- continuing until he came to Dartmouth to do his first biochemical work.
It was there that he was told by an elderly woman that the DDT that the town of Hanover was using to combat Dutch Elm disease was killing the birds.
"I saw the dead birds on the campus. And then we started to see some that were alive, with tremors. At first we didn't know what we were doing, but we sent petitions and we went to the town fathers who said: 'We are careful. We read the labels. We are very responsible. We do not want to kill birds.'
"We began to conduct a survey. There were four of us, who met during lunch. Two weeks after the spraying of DDT there would be a dead robin, and then another, and another. By the end of the semester in June we had 100 dead robins in our freezer.
"A small grant from the Fish and Wildlife Service enabled us to amass enough evidence to say to the town fathers, 'Now look what you did!' And they changed to another chemical."
In the fall of 1965, Charles Wurster moved to Stony Brook where he met the biologist Bob Smolker and the adventurer/naturalist explorer Dennis Puleston. He met Art Cooley, a high school biology teacher who still seems to him the soul of the movement.
Along with a number of friends and even a few of Art Cooley's brighter students, they started the Brookhaven Town Natural Resources Committee, whose main concern was such things as protection of seals, the dredging of swamps and the crushing of terns' nests by careless beach buggies.
They would meet at various homes once a month, and between meetings wrote letters to politicians. "Then a lawyer came into our midst," he said. It is with affection that Charlie describes Victor Yannacone, whose wife Carol had become upset when she saw some men from the Suffolk County Mosquito Commission cleaning their truck and then emptying the DDT washings into Yaphank Lake, killing the fish.
In a fortunate confluence of circumstances, Victor Yannacone saw a letter that Charlie had published in a local newspaper.
"Already, by the time that he called me, he had filed a suit in Carol's name. He had recognized the problem. But he didn't have the scientific evidence.
"He was an absolute believer in the court system, and that was his strength. We in turn needed what he had. We didn't have any idea how to get the system to move. If you kept knocking on the door, he was to teach us, eventually someone would make a mistake. You would be able to get in the court and stay there."
Although the presiding judge was unable to allow Carol, legally, to stand in for a lake or a fish, he was able to call an emergency halt to the commission's use of DDT until more conclusive evidence could be amassed.
While the judge was convinced from the onset, he did eventually have to throw the case out of court after the 18-month period of the injunction was over -- there was no place yet in the law for Carol's sort of claim -- but not before the Legislature was convinced to permanently outlaw the chemical.
The interval had provided politicians and public alike the chance for a serious hearing of the scientists' arguments that no previous editorial writing had accomplished. The case gave birth also to the strategy of "winning by losing," vital to a generation of environmentalists to come.
The story moves first into Michigan, and then into Wisconsin. In Michigan, the chemical is dieldrin, and again it is a case of winning by losing, although the circumstances, this time, are different. And already there are many more players.
Charlie had managed to convince me that I could not get the full story by talking to him alone, and so it is now 10 days later, the day that has been named for his celebration at Stony Brook. In the big and bare room where the podium and slide projector sit, one wall sports a map of the earth as seen from outer space, the other a black and white topographical representation of Long Island, whose crustacean-like texture seems to give the earth-world a strange almost prehistoric aura, half of insect and half of the dinosaur world.
Although it is broad daylight outside, the fluorescent lights vie with the incandescent. Most of the scientists are older, in their 60's and 70's, and are wearing formal suits, so that little belies their more anarchist beginnings.
Suddenly a woman comes in, dressed in red from head to toe, a long red gypsy skirt, much embroidered, and a flaming red jacket that falls more like a cape. The room seems to bow in deference, and surprise. Lorrie Otto has come to this conference from Wisconsin, along with Fred Ott.
An excitement with the history -- so shared -- is spoken more in this moment of entrance than in all of the words.
It is as if suddenly all stories are joined in a strange medley of choral voices. I am asking:"But why you. Surely others also saw them? What made you in particular devote your whole life to this?"
Lorrie Otto and Fred Ott are both talking at once. It is the same dying robins: how they put a dying bird into the hands of Fred's daughter who said: "To watch that robin trembling in my hand; I knew that I was going to be a scientist!" -- and she did become one, testifying in behalf of the environment; how the people who loved the elms and the people who loved the birds were at loggerheads, over what they should be saving.
By that time Charlie and his friends knew that DDT was no longer working. They were able, as would be their way whenever possible, to offer more effective alternatives.
Within days of Lorrie Otto's phone call to Charlie, scientists from all over the country, and even one from Canada and one from Sweden, had moved into her house to establish a center for studying the case.
One by one the speakers rose to tell their parts. Often, Ian Nisbet, an environmental consultant pointed out, the first note of changes came not from those interested in ecology but rather from unlikely places. Thus it was the falconer who noticed the gradual disappearance of peregrine falcons and bald eagles. Illegal collectors of birds' eggs held evidence of shell thinning over time. Part of the work of the organizers was always in extending the circle of collaborators.
Had the making of the group into a nationwide organization lessened the fervor of the earliest participants? had it resulted in compromise, in a weakening of resolve? Those whom I met all would argue it had not. Rather there was something rather heartening in the endurance.
"I like to think of it as a bit like the evolutionary process itself," Charlie said. "We kept more people than different circumstances would have predicted."
In the course of our conversations he would return very often to the idea of "win/win." Of course there are some situations where this is impossible. With the oil and coal companies, as with Montrose Chemical (the manufacturer of DDT), there was no way that you wanted them to win.
He would speak of the fact that he firmly believes that environmental change is possible within our present market economy; he does not feel that the system has to change, but rather that we have made the mistake of assigning zero value "let us say to the elephant, available to the ivory hunter for nothing."
"While the hunter gets the full profit, the world loses an elephant. It is the same with the whale and the air and the right to pollute it. We must think very differently about assigning a price to what should not be free.
"With each administration our relationship has been different. Right now, with the new Congress, our main concern is with maintenance, with not losing ground."
At the end of the evening, William Ruckelshaus, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1972 who delivered the historic decision to ban DDT nationwide, gave a speech in which he begged environmentalists not to see government as the enemy.
My mind traveled back to the rather delightfully anarchist notion of the "one man committee" that Charlie Wurster had mentioned in passing.
"If responsibility for what is going to happen is in one place and everybody knows it, then it usually works out. If two people are supposed to write a letter to the editor, or get something moving, it is far less effective."
He had told me of an organization he knew of "that was beautifully organized, only it didn't yet know what it was going to do."
"When you aren't that well organized, when circumstances keep changing, you too are free to change. You are not stuck in a course that might be obsolete. And the focus becomes the job itself.
I thought about the moral meaning of respect for biodiversity, concern for all species, including the seemingly unimportant ones, in relationship to a whole whose secrets might never be known."For, years ago, who could have forseen that a certain mold would become instrumental in making penicillin; who would have wanted to save that particular mold?"
Was it possible that even thinking of such things would breed less competition? more interest in relationship?
In the beginning, for Charlie Wurster, it was very much a front-line struggle. While Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" had moved a generation and paved the way for public sympathy, it was not until scientists and lawyers came together that real change could occur.
Did he miss being in that front line place? I had asked on the afternoon of that first Easter Sunday visit.
Yes, in a way he did, he said, as he spoke of how he felt his training wouldn't allow him to make the kind of contribution that is needed in the major scientific areas that preoccupy him now: those of population expansion, preservation of the world's forests and energy use, how he is reading in all of those areas, even as he pursues his plans to lead eco-tours in Africa and New Guinea.
Then he seemed to grow thoughtful for a moment. "I guess if I were to involve myself in anything in that same way again, it would be in the area of how pollutants can function as hormones. Way back even in the 40's, I noticed some papers about how roosters who had been exposed to DDT were no longer crowing properly. They didn't have proper combs and they would function as if they were semi-males. And then there were other pollutants enhancing femininity, decreasing masculinity. Over a 50-year period, human sperm counts had decreased by about half. There were alligators in Florida being born with half-length penises. On the west coast, where Montrose Chemical Company was situated, this hormonal chaos could be seen."
As day deepened, Charlie told me the story of the Montrose vicinity's lesbian gulls, how when it came to be breeding time there were five times as many females as males, so that the females paired up, laying their eggs and then sitting on them. They had made double clutches of eggs, but of course they were sterile.
"The males didn't even bother to come to the breeding grounds, so that the issue was really their absence," he repeated as he mused over whether there was anything he could personally do to explore the strange gradual "feminization of the planet."
"With DDT I was one of the troops," he repeated. "DDT involved many things -- birds and fish and cancer -- and they all fitted together. I knew what I wanted. Do you know that old saying, you can't go home."
Day deepened, and the forest outside grew even more beautiful.
It would be romantic to say that the birds began to sing, but that day, to my notice, they didn't.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Drew M. Crandall;
A Minister Goes to the Marketplace

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
DREW M. CRANDALL, 39, is the founder and president of Keep In Touch, a sales and marketing company in Vernon, and the head of the New England chapters of Fellowship of Companies for Christ Inc.
The fellowship began meeting in Connecticut in February 1991, and has since grown to include nearly 100 active members -- business owners and chief executives from sole proprietorships to large corporations. The group meets regularly to pray, study Biblical principles for business and share experiences. 
 Mr. Crandall was born in Bridgeport and grew up in Connecticut, New Jersey and Long Island, attending Congregational and Methodist churches, then went to the University of Connecticut where he majored in sociology with a minor in economics. A career in sales and advertising followed.
Mr. Crandall discussed the fellowship during an interview recently at his office in Vernon. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
 Q. If you're interested in serving Christ, why not enter the ministry?
A. More than anything else, I know that God has called me to be here, to be a minister in the marketplace. If I had the title pastor, I think a lot of doors would be closed to me. But having a business card that says "president" opens a lot of doors.
If we say we believe on Sunday mornings and we don't show it the rest of the week, we're hypocrites. We really strive to demonstrate in the daily operation of our businesses that the Lord really is our Lord.
 Q. Why are members presidents and C.E.O.'s? Why not employees?
A. There are a number of business-oriented ministries.
I was saved -- that's the term, I trusted the Lord as my Savior -- at a Full Gospel Businessmen's Fellowship breakfast. That's an international organization aimed at a broader spectrum of business people, employees or middle managers or owners. There's another ministry I'm involved with in Hartford, the Connecticut Christian Business and Professional Association, which is also broad. You have the Gideons, who are businesspeople whose ministry is primarily distributing Bibles.
When the founders of the Fellowships of Companies for Christ organized in Atlanta in the late 1970's, they realized when it came to strong Bible teachings on how to run a business, they couldn't find a source.
I find I need encouragement from other C.E.O.'s, because the buck stops with you on every single thing. The degree of accountability and responsibility is enormous. Unless you walk in similar shoes, it's hard to understand that.
 Q. Is it predominantly any one denomination?
A. No, there are at least 12 to 15 denominations represented in Connecticut. It's not the label on your church that saves you, it's the Lord that saves you. There are three criteria to become a member. You must be a born-again Christian. Next, you must occupy the office of chief executive officer, president or owner of a for-profit business. Third, you must be active in a local church, giving of your time and talents.
 Q. Does the organization require that members close on Sundays or not use certain advertising techniques?
A. It doesn't have a guidebook that says, "This is what you shall do and this is what you shall not do," because the ministry trusts that if you know Christ as your Lord and Savior and the Holy Spirit is in you, you'll do right. There's no perfect business. If you were to look at my business with a magnifying glass you'd see things that aren't perfect. But as you are taught the Word and talk to other Christian C.E.O.'s, the Lord will gradually impress upon you what you should do or not do.
Q. Is there anything a member could do that would cause you to ask them to leave?
A. I can't remember a case where someone was chastised or booted out.
If you chose not to be really zealous about serving the Lord in your business you'd probably drift away, because you wouldn't want to hang around people who are on fire for the Lord.
But how do you deal with people who may have crossed the line? If that person comes back and asks for forgiveness, I say give him a hug and move forward.
 Q. Are there any types of businesses that would not be welcome?
A. There are real obvious ones -- if the C.E.O. of a pornography company came, the decision would be easy.
But there are others that are not so easy. I would have to plead with the Lord to give me wisdom, to know what to do. The company that makes those killer bullets, for instance, or gambling.
But I don't think those issues lend themselves to a list that says, "These industries are in and these industries are out." You have to handle it on a case-by-case basis.
Q. What are some of the Biblical principles for business?
A. The top one comes from First Timothy: "For the love of money is the root of all evil." We have to be very cognizant of the enticement of material wealth.
Another would be that to the best of your ability, you have to honor your financial commitments. If you use bankruptcy to hold off your creditors to give you time to organize your finances and honor your debts, there's nothing wrong with that. But from a Scriptural and moral standpoint, to file for bankruptcy and stiff your vendors . . . it may be legal technically, but not before the Lord.
Q. Are there situations where business really benefited from following Christian principles?
A. Yes, from one in particular -- the Golden Rule: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." If you love your customers and your employees and vendors, and treat them as you want to be treated, you will benefit. People gravitate toward people who love them. Nobody wants to go where they're not welcome, and if you make it clear you don't care about your customer, what kind of business are you going to have?
 Q. Are there situations where businesses have been hurt by not following Christian principles?
A. Five, 10 years ago, we had a few pillars of the state economy: defense, insurance and financial services, and real estate. We've seen those three pillars shake; they came down crumbling.
You look at the real causes for that trouble, and you can point to Scriptural principles that were broken, greed being one of them, lack of wisdom being another.
There were some worldwide political factors that played a role in it, but I think if we're honest with ourselves, much of the recession in Connecticut was self-inflicted.
 Q. Do you risk offending non-Christian customers by promoting Christianity?
A. I set out to be a Christian company, right from the start, and my brochure makes it clear where I stand with the Lord.
However, we do live in a pluralistic world, and not everybody believes in the Bible, not everyone believes in Christ, not everyone is as zealous in their faith as myself.
There have been occasions where I've lost business, or haven't gotten business, because of my Christian faith. That's the price I pay for being who God has called me to be.
By the same token, though, there has been business we've gotten because of our Christian faith.
 Q. Do you expect your customers to be Christians?
A. No. I do not have the fortress mentality, where we have to deal only with Christians. That's the monastery approach. We're out in the highways and byways of life, dealing with real world issues and real people.
 Q. Do most companies have a moral basis?
A. I think they do. I serve on the board of the Better Business Bureau, and the Tolland County Chamber of Commerce. I think, fundamentally, most business owners have a heart to do right. Perhaps they have more of a sensitivity to customers because that's where their bread and butter comes from.
 Q. What do you find most discouraging about today's business climate?
A. It does seem, at times, you're punished for trying to do what's right. I've had some experiences where I've done what I think my conscience and God have told me to do, but I'm beat up for trying to be a Christian. Yet I see so many ungodly people out there raping and pillaging, and everyone seems to be applauding them.
But you know, King David, when he wrote the Psalms, saw some of that too. But the Lord gave him the wisdom to have a more eternal perspective. He used to cry out, "I see the wicked prosper," and the Psalmist said, "but then I saw the end of their ways."
We're dealing with eternity here, and my life is just a vapor, that's what the Bible says.

HEADLINE: Welfare Rules Imperil Battered Women

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your May 8 news article on migration of welfare recipients from Chicago to Wisconsin draws the reader to simple and unfair conclusions. The poor cite a variety of reasons for moving that mirror those of the wealthy. And yes, for those subsisting on low grants, extra money doesn't hurt. What hurts are residency requirements designed to discourage relocations based on an assumed pursuit of higher benefits. 
 The two-tier concept, which restricts newcomers to benefit levels of their former states, punishes fleeing domestic-violence victims and their children. Abusers typically escalate abuse when they sense control slipping, so miles provide added protection. Victims who have left behind all assets for a chance at safety are welcomed with assured poverty.
While benefits are higher in Wisconsin than in Illinois, you don't report that Wisconsin's $617 grant for a family of four is hardly sufficient for housing, child care and other costs.
Punitive welfare reforms bent on reducing the rolls threaten to cut off a vital bridge to independence and safety. Rigid work requirements designed to punish or modify "lazy" behavior ignore the reality that recipients' good-faith efforts to work are often met with beatings.
It is vexing when legislators who purport to be tough on crime are the same ones who endorse policies that make it harder for women to break the cycle of violence. Women may be forced to choose economic security and abuse over poverty and homelessness.

HEADLINE: Old Soldier May Take Deng's Mantle

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China

 BODY:
Of the six old men likely to remain as revolutionary elders of China after Deng Xiaoping dies, only one has commanded the 3.2-million-member People's Liberation Army, a key institution during the coming political succession.
Only one has made a state visit to Washington, talks frequently about the importance of strong relations with the United States and counts George Bush among his friends. 
 Only one was at Mr. Deng's side both when the paramount leader began China's economic reforms here in the prosperous south and when he had to rescue the reforms from a hard-line backlash that followed the Tiananmen Square violence in June 1989.
His name is Yang Shangkun, a military man who has often backed reformers. And among the octogenarian elders -- Mr. Yang is 88 -- he poses the biggest threat to upend the political order that Mr. Deng, his lifelong friend, has bequeathed to a restless nation of 1.2 billion.
Although China's political succession is apparently complete with the elevation of Jiang Zemin as head of state, general secretary of the Communist Party and chief of the military, the revolutionary elders who survive Mr. Deng -- who is 90 and in poor health -- will continue to wield enormous influence, Chinese and Western officials say.
The most influential conservative among the elders, Chen Yun, died at the age of 89 on April 10, but he is survived by Peng Zhen, 92, Mr. Yang, Song Renqiong, 85, Bo Yibo, 86, Wan Li, 78, and Song Ping, 78.
It was these leaders who elevated Mr. Jiang after Zhao Ziyang, now 76, was deposed as party boss during the Tiananmen Square crisis.
While Mr. Yang's age makes it doubtful that he will dominate Chinese succession over a number of years, his influence after Mr. Deng's death could tip the factional balance that has swung between Marxist conservatives and liberal reformers for nearly two decades.
"Yang Shangkun is making a serious bid to come back, and he has a tremendous network inside the country," said Douglas Paal, a White House specialist on China during the Bush Administration.
Even as the Communist Party leadership in Beijing projects an image of unity and stability to the world, Mr. Yang has been politicking among the regional party and military leaders who have shown growing disaffection with the increasingly conservative policy from Beijing.
Even though he is nominally out of power now, just three summers ago it seemed that Mr. Yang could succeed Mr. Deng as China's paramount leader.
Mr. Yang was the only member of the group of Chinese elders who had the same combination of longstanding military and political connections as Mr. Deng and, of equal importance, he was committed to Mr. Deng's economic reforms.
"Yang Shangkun goes along with Deng and always has," said James R. Lilley, a former United States Ambassador to China. "If you go back and look at his career, there is a consistent pattern of his coming down on the side of the reformers."
Mr. Deng's sudden decision in the summer of 1992 to drop Mr. Yang and purge the military of his influence, and that of his younger half-brother, Gen. Yang Baibing, has been one of the enduring mysteries of China's succession struggle.
Now, from the accounts of former Communist Party insiders, Chinese observers and Western diplomats, the dimensions of Mr. Yang's assault on the political status quo are becoming clearer.
According to these people, Mr. Yang was stripped of his offices after he tried to remove President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng in early 1992. In their place, he promoted the idea of elevating more centrist and reform-minded party leaders.
Western diplomats say they believe that in 1992, Mr. Yang sought to broker the return of Zhao Ziyang, the Communist Party leader ousted in 1989 over his refusal to send the tanks and machine gunners against unarmed democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
Many Chinese find it paradoxical that Mr. Yang, who carried out Mr. Deng's assault orders against the students in 1989, has been working behind the scenes to rehabilitate Mr. Zhao.
For a man who is supposed to be out of power, Mr. Yang gets remarkable attention when he demonstrates his influence, as he did this winter here in Guangdong, China's richest province.
One newspaper in Shenzhen, the contained capitalist economic zone across from Hong Kong, published Mr. Yang's picture on the front page as if he were visiting royalty.
In Zhuhai, which borders Macao, the city fathers feted Mr. Yang aboard a yacht. After all, one city resident said, it was Mr. Yang's influence in the Chinese military that got Zhuhai permission to build an international airport, putting the sleepy port town on Asia's map.
It was said that Mr. Yang was retracing the steps of Mr. Deng's southern crusade of 1992, which signaled China's economic boom. For Mr. Yang to have made this pilgrimage speaks volumes about his political intention to play a kingmaker role in the post-Deng era.
The survivor of numerous internecine party struggles, Mr. Yang cuts the figure of a self-assured Chinese warlord. Gone are the dress greens he wore like a marshal of the Red Army. Now, in forced retirement, he wears conservative business suits, which render him slightly rotund, Buddha-like.
Amazingly spry at 88, Mr. Yang moved nimbly through Shenzhen's botanical gardens in January, even visiting the trees that he and Mr. Deng planted in 1992. His public speeches are spare and politically correct.
In Shenzhen, Mr. Yang praised Mr. Deng for his "foresight" in creating "special economic zones" where China could experiment with foreign investment and free-market economics that are now transforming the country. By working in Shenzhen, he said, a whole generation of Communist Party cadres have become committed reformers. "They are its wealth," he said.
In the culture of the Communist Party, this is the gospel of reform, and that is why here, among the gleaming towers of southern China's richest province, Mr. Yang's name still commands Deng-like respect.
If the political succession Mr. Deng has put in place suddenly collapsed, it would not be a first.
Mao selected and purged three potential heirs before he finally settled on Hua Guofeng, whom he anointed by uttering from his deathbed, "With you in charge, I am content."
After Mao died in September 1976, two years passed before Mr. Deng emerged from a bloodless but intense political struggle to become first among equals in the circle of revolutionary elders.
Today, as Mr. Deng's death approaches, China's enfeebled paramount leader has uttered to a daughter that with Mr. Jiang in charge, "I am content."
Many Chinese believe that this prescription, too, will not endure. Mr. Jiang was always a compromise, a choice least offensive to China's hard-liners, whom Mr. Deng was forced to placate after the democratic uprising in June 1989.

HEADLINE: An Economic Ghost: Stagflation;
G.O.P. Revives a 70's Bugaboo, Hoping to Spread Any Blame

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
For months, economists have been using the cheery term "soft landing" to describe an American economy that seems to be gliding to a slower but steady rate of growth after several boom years.
But now an uglier word is making the rounds: stagflation, a combination of paltry growth, rising unemployment and spiraling inflation. 
 The Republican majority on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress cried stagflation in an economic analysis issued Friday. The analysis followed a Government report saying that consumer prices climbed in April at the fastest rate in eight months, as well as earlier reports that producer prices had risen faster in April while unemployment jumped.
The politics of crying stagflation are clear. Republicans are nervous that if the economy goes into a recession during next year's Presidential campaign, some of the blame may be heaped on their budget cuts instead of the policies of the Clinton Administration. So they are striking early by pointing out that the economy has already had problems, and by trying to link these problems to the White House.
"With both the producer and consumer price indices rising at 3 to 4 percent annual rates, and data on the economy showing weakness, the recent economic performance continues to resemble that of the 'stagflation' of the late 1970's," the G.O.P.-driven analysis said. "This is largely the result of easy money in 1992 and 1993 that masked the Clinton tax increases. Now that the easy-money stimulus is wearing off, the slowdown effects of those tax increases are showing up."
White House officials are no different in trying to manipulate perceptions of the economy for political gain. Leon Panetta, the President's chief of staff, led a succession of top officials in daily briefings last week warning that Republican budget proposals could turn an economic slowdown into a recession.
Economists tend to be skeptical of both sides' assertions. They dismiss the idea that modest tax-policy changes in 1993 could have seriously changed the course of a $6 trillion to $7 trillion economy. They also dismiss the notion of serious economic harm from a Republican blueprint to balance the budget by reducing the deficit by less than $30 billion a year in each of the next seven years.
With few exceptions, economists also doubt that the United States also faces stagflation now. Instead, most expect that the country will avoid steeply rising inflation, but may pay a price that could prove just as painful in higher unemployment and a further widening of the gap between rich and poor. They forecast growth slowing to 2 or 3 percent this year, from 4 percent last year. Most economists consider slowing growth, as well as an actual decline in business activity, to be an ingredient of stagflation.
And while rising prices and unemployment may mean that April qualified as a single month of stagflation in a narrow and technical sense, the overall structure of the economy has changed so much since the late 1970's that a return to the problems of those years seems unlikely.
"In some literal sense, the month was a month of stagflation, but that does not capture the spirit of the times," said Neal M. Soss, an economic consultant and money manager in New York.
In 1979 unemployment averaged 5.8 percent, the same rate as in April 1995. But consumer prices were then rising at an annual rate of 13.3 percent. Consumer prices increased four-tenths of 1 percent in April, and at an annual rate of only 3.1 percent for the first four months of this year.
The first use of the term "stagflation," in 1965, has been attributed to Iain Macleod, a leading British Conservative politician, who would become Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the United States, it has been used to describe adverse economic conditions at times during the Nixon, Ford and Carter administrations.
There are powerful forces at work now that could slow price rises in the coming months. Commodity prices, which soared in 1994, have fallen this year for a wide range of products from iron and steel scrap to cattle hides. That will eventually mean a little less pressure to raise prices for everyone from steelmakers to producers of shoes.
At the same time, the Federal Reserve's seven increases in interest rates in the last 15 months have eroded demand, and with it, long-term inflation pressure on the prices of cars and other products. New homes may be the exception, as falling mortgage rates have made them more affordable, and this could lead to more construction this summer.
But as overall demand for goods and services fades as the economy slows, companies are facing a difficult choice between raising prices or cutting back on labor, typically by laying off workers or cutting wages. With companies still encountering strong customer resistance to price increases, the result seems to be the sort of aggressive action such as that by Mobil, which announced on May 1 the layoff of nearly 10 percent of its work force a week after posting a big rise in first-quarter profit.
With national unemployment increasing three-tenths of a percentage point in April, to 5.8 percent, businesses may retain the ability to forestall at least the inflation side of stagflation, though possibly at the expense of their employees.
Darwin L. Beck, an economist at the First Boston Corporation, said, "They're certainly going to try that, and if the labor market is as weak as April's data indicates, labor is not going to have much leverage."

HEADLINE: Two States, Two Gatherings and a Lot of Anti-Government Sentiment;
At Michigan Rally, Unyielding Anger At the Brady Bill

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: STERLING HEIGHTS, Mich., May 13

 BODY:
At Gunstock '95, held beneath hazy skies at Freedom Hill County Park here, a Doberman pinscher named Brutus wore a collar made from a bandoleer.
Compared with the sentiment at Woodstock in 1969, the anti-authoritarian spirit at this gun rights rally had a steely edge. Among the two thousand or three thousand people who browsed through booths run by chapters of the Michigan Militia, the John Birch Society and other right-wing groups, tastes ran to camouflage and the words of Patrick Henry rather than tie-dye and the lyrics of Arlo Guthrie. 
 The only live music was a rendition of the national anthem, the only chanting a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, and the only controlled substance on everybody's minds the ammunition they had left at home.
"Adolf Hitler was the first one who supported gun registration!" thundered Dave Jaye, a Republican state representative, in one speech to the crowd. Mr. Jaye is sponsoring legislation to permit residents of Michigan to carry concealed firearms.
At the booths, literature warned of a one-world government and of threats posed by "pro-animal extremists" and the complex financial instruments known as derivatives. Ball caps for sale condemned to hell Sarah Brady, the wife of the Brady Bill namesake, James Brady. T-shirts called President Clinton a "Socialist-Marxist Commu-Nazi."
"Where is Lee Harvey Oswald when his country needs him?" asked one bumper sticker, for sale at a booth run by a local Libertarian Party. Other stands sold waffle cones, pizza and Italian sausage.
"We don't want our children to lose their freedom," said Susan Timko, explaining why she had brought Catherine, 13, and Matthew, 10, to picnic in this blue-collar Detroit suburb and listen to five hours of speeches about Waco, the Los Angeles riots and theories about a government link to the Oklahoma City bombing. "When they're our age, I don't want to see them living under suppression."
This was the second annual Gunstock, which is sponsored by the Gun Owners of Macomb County and the Macomb Coalition of Republicans. About 3,000 to 3,500 people paid $5 each to attend, organizers said, down from the 10,000 they claimed last year. Police estimates for this year were closer to 2,500.
After last fall's elections, "I don't think people feel their rights are under the same assault they were last year," said Joseph Munem, an organizer. Some attendees said the boat show drew people away; others said people feared that undercover Government agents would be attending this year.
Mr. Munem said he had named the event Gunstock because "it just has sort of a festive atmosphere."
"It's not a gun rally: it's like Woodstock," Mr. Munem said.
Aside from a revulsion to gun control, attendees -- engineers, police officers, United Automobile Workers union members and others -- seemed to share deep fears of Government conspiracies and a thirst for information confirming them.
"You read a book like this, and you start to see what's going on," Tom Lightbody, a World War II veteran and a member of the John Birch Society, said as he raised his copy of "Global Tyranny, Step by Step: The United Nations and the Emerging World Order." "In the schools, they're teaching kids that they're world citizens. They're not learning about America."
The Oklahoma City bombing and its political fallout were not far from Mr. Lightbody's thoughts. "It was horrible," he said of the attack. But he said the Government was using it as an excuse to crack down on groups who were not involved. "The same broad brush they're applying to the militia movement I saw applied to the John Birch Society in 1961," he said.
Fear may have brought the people together, but even those with the darkest views of the future seemed able to relax and have fun. Dale Orthner, for example, described burying food, medical supplies and ammunition to prepare for the coming chaos. He had also bought two handguns, two rifles and a shotgun. "I really don't like to hunt," he said, "but in a post-economically collapsed society, I'm going to have to."
Mr. Orthner, 25, a member of the Michigan Constitutional State Militia, was concerned that widespread use of derivatives would destroy the world's economy. "It's designed to fail by the oligarchs," he said. He identified "the oligarchs" as the Rockefellers, the Morgans, the Rothschilds, the House of Windsor and others. "They'll let us wallow in the mire of our apparently self-inflicted depravity for a couple of months, and then come in and say, 'We can help,' " he said. They could then "depopulate the planet," he said.
But, even as he described the apocalypse at a mile a minute, Mr. Orthner, a real estate agent, grinned and waved as he caught sight of clients in the passing crowd.
Where Mr. Orthner railed against derivatives, hunters' rights advocates worried that people were forgetting that human beings were predators by nature, and Libertarians complained that the Government had given the United Nations the moon.
One man, who would identify himself only as George, seemed most concerned about the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He said FEMA was running concentration camps in the United States. "They're international police," said George, who was wearing red, white and blue suspenders over his blue oxford cloth shirt.
Despite his fear of the Government, George said he was a member of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, although he would not say at what level of government he worked or in what capacity. "It's a job, sir," he said.
Many attendees wore "patriot awareness" ribbons, camouflage bows pinned to their chests.
Among the speakers, the star attraction was Mark Scott, host of a talk show on WXYT Radio here. Standing before a giant American flag, he suggested that the Central Intelligence Agency was involved in the Oklahoma City bombing. "It was committed by C.I.A. contractors," he said, adding that the Government hoped to disarm "the American patriot movement." Like other speakers, he urged his listeners to vote and to obey the law.
"We should remember to be law-abiding," Mr. Scott said. "But we will remember that what they won't allow us at the ballot box can be won at the bullet box.
"Keep your powder dry," he added.

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS FACE AN INTERNAL FIGHT ON CUTTING TAXES

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
As the House and Senate prepare to debate watershed plans to balance the Federal budget, the authors of the Republican plans differed today over whether the final version of the proposal should include a huge tax cut that would almost certainly draw a Presidential veto.
In broadcast interviews today, the chairmen of the two budget committees that wrote and approved the measures appeared to be at loggerheads over the tax question. The House budget plan includes a $340 billion tax cut for businesses and individuals, while the Senate plan leaves taxes at their current level. 
 "The debate about whether we ought to have tax relief in the budget" is over, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the House chairman, said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation." Critics had contended that it would be almost impossible to cut taxes and erase the deficit. But with the approval of the House budget plan, he said that as far as he was concerned "that argument has been laid to rest."
Mr. Kasich's counterpart, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, said he was sticking by his position. "We don't have a tax cut until we balance the budget," he said on the same program.
The politics are straightforward enough. Republicans probably have enough votes in both chambers to enact any budget package they choose, but they lack enough Democratic support to assemble the two-thirds vote required to override a Presidential veto. And their prospects of getting it are fairly slim.
That means they must either produce a final budget this summer with enough concessions to persuade Democrats that it is not worth a messy political battle, or push something close to their current proposals and brace for a fight that could briefly shut down the entire Government.
The route they take depends on how Republicans in the House and Senate handle the current debates over their respective budget proposals, which are but frameworks for the actual budget that will be written in a few months. One way or the other, the two chambers must produce a single budget framework late this month that will set the course for the rest of the year.
Today Mr. Domenici and Mr. Kasich both said they were confident that the House and Senate would approve their proposals largely unchanged.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said the two parties could work together to balance the budget if both the Republicans and the Clinton Administration dropped tax cut proposals and found common ground on health-care reform.
"If we can do that, then I think frankly we can come to an agreement," Mr. Dodd said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "That's what we ought to be doing, not trying to one-up each other."
The full House, its Republican majority unified under Speaker Newt Gingrich, is expected to rubber-stamp its version of the deficit-reduction plan in a vote this week. The more fragmented Republican bloc in the Senate is most likely to take longer to approve its budget measure, haggling over amendments that would increase spending on the military and over other areas of Republican concern.
The White House proposed its own far more modest tax cut, totaling $63 billion over five years, in the budget that President Clinton sent to Congress in February. That plan included tax breaks for middle income families with children and for whom household income is less than $75,000 a year, deductions for college tuition and an expanded individual retirement account. Mr. Clinton's budget is considered dead in the Republican Congress, but that $63 billion is seen by many as at least the low end of what the White House might consider spending on tax cuts in a final budget.
The Republicans who dominate the House favor deep tax and spending reductions as a matter of ideology. Among other things, the $340 billion tax cut in the House budget resolution would grant credits to all taxpaying families earning less than $250,000 a year and sharply reduce the capital-gains tax rate.
At this early stage, no one was ready to suggest how the bitterly partisan budget fight that seems certain to erupt over a deficit-reduction package will play out. Nor does anyone really know what the Republican budget will eventually do about tax cuts. But the Senate's budget outline approved last week does set aside $170 billion that Congressional analysts say might be saved if a balanced budget lowers interest rates and therefore the cost of the Government's debt. House leaders have suggested that that figure might be a starting point in any talks.
The tax issue is easily the most pressing question facing the Republican majority in Congress as the budget debates begin.
The struggle will unfold on the House and Senate floors over the next two weeks. And the outcome, political strategists say, will shape not just the final battle between Republicans and Democrats over the 1996 budget this fall, but the 1996 Presidential race as well.
"That's the showdown," a top aide to House Republican leaders said in an interview. "It's going to be one of the defining moments of this year."
A sprinkling of Republicans in Congress began over the weekend to question specifics of the House and Senate plans, especially the Senate's proposal to hold military spending basically at current levels.
The two proposals, called resolutions, each seek to save more than $1 trillion from Federal spending that is currently projected in the 1996 fiscal year and the succeeding six years. They are essentially frameworks for the all budgets through 2002, setting overall spending levels for major parts of the Federal Government. The fates of individual programs will be decided by appropriations committees in separate bills this summer.
Once the two chambers ratify the proposals, which is a foregone conclusion in most experts' minds, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Kasich and other House and Senate leaders will try to meld the plans into a compromise version that should come to a final vote in both houses later this month.
Private budget analysts said the two committees had performed a historic feat but cautioned that the resolutions did not reduce projected spending in actual programs, but only instructed other committees to make reductions later this summer.
"These are serious numbers," Stanley Collender, the Federal budget expert at the accounting firm Price-Waterhouse in Washington, said of the Republican plans. "These are not based on rosy economic assumptions."

A castoff show may come back to haunt CBS from its lofty new perch on NBC's schedule.

BYLINE: By Bill Carter 

 BODY:
FOR Andy Hill, these are days of highly mixed emotions. On the one hand, he is elated because as president of CBS Entertainment Productions he will see a show developed by his company placed in a promising position on the fall television schedule, a position where it stands an excellent chance of becoming, as he puts it, "a monster hit."
On the other hand, Mr. Hill is feeling "some real awkwardness." If the show, a half-hour comedy called "Caroline in the City," does become the success Mr. Hill expects, CBS -- which needs hit comedies like the Titanic needed lifeboats -- will not be the beneficiary of its hearty ratings. NBC will. 
 The prospect of a CBS-produced show becoming a hit for NBC is the latest example of how far the networks are willing to go to become suppliers of programs as well as their distributors. In this case, CBS's programming department passed on the opportunity to place "Caroline" on its own schedule. But the network's production division, acting like any other studio in Hollywood, sought out other buyers for the series -- and found one in a competing network.
NBC thinks so much of "Caroline," which revolves around a young woman cartoonist living in Manhattan, that the network is expected to announce today that it will give the comedy the 9:30 P.M. time slot on Thursdays. That is the most highly coveted time period for a new show in television because it is sandwiched between the two highest-rated shows in the business, "Seinfeld" and "E.R."
Warren Littlefield, president of NBC Entertainment, says "Caroline" has a chance to follow in the tradition of NBC hits that have thrived on Thursdays, among them "Seinfeld," "Cheers" and "Frasier."
 If "Caroline" does become a success of that magnitude, CBS will certainly benefit financially because reruns of hit comedies often bring their owners $100 million or more in syndication profits. "CBS Productions would have a tremendous asset," Mr. Hill said. "That would be great news for CBS corporately."
Still, it would be far better economically for CBS if the show was part of its own ailing prime-time schedule. Instead, "Caroline" has a chance to do even more damage to the CBS lineup by pulling more viewers to NBC.
Executives at all the networks say this kind of arrangement will be repeated more often as increasingly tangled alliances between networks, producers and writers create situations in which traditional rivals become partners. Last fall, for example, CBS had high hopes for a comedy called "The Boys Are Back," a show owned by ABC Productions. (It failed.)
"With the earth moving and shifting constantly in this business, with networks being bought or sold and new alliances being made every day, there are no rules to the competition any more," said Brad Grey, co-chairman of Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, a production company that has a partnership agreement with ABC. That partnership has produced one comedy, "News Radio," which is now on the air and doing quite well. But it's on NBC, not ABC.
Mr. Grey said "News Radio" was simply a more appropriate show for NBC. "Creatively, it just fit NBC," Mr. Grey said, referring to NBC's enviable track record in scheduling youthful, adult-oriented, urban-based romantic comedies.
Ted Harbert, president of ABC Entertainment and the man who selects the shows that play on the network's prime-time schedule, said much the same thing when NBC picked up "News Radio." NBC had the right place to put the comedy, he said, and had other shows that were compatible with it.
Similarly, Mr. Hill said, "Caroline in the City" simply works better as a NBC show.
For one thing, the comedy would have been substantially different had it remained at CBS, especially at the top of the bill.
The actress Lea Thompson, who plays Caroline, had a contract with NBC. "Warren Littlefield delivered Lea Thompson," Mr. Hill said, "and he deserves all the credit for that."
Indeed, Mr. Littlefield had been looking for the right project for Ms. Thompson, one of the stars of the "Back to the Future" movies. He said that Ms. Thompson was leaning toward starring in a one-hour drama being developed by NBC but that he steered her instead toward "Caroline" because the show seemed so right for her.
As Mr. Hill explained it, NBC had a surer sense of how to turn "Caroline" into a hit. When first presented to CBS, the show centered on the romantic relationship between an older woman and a younger man. Program executives at CBS passed on the idea, Mr. Hill said, "because they felt they had similar shows in development that they liked better."
Still convinced that "we had a hit show in this script," Mr. Hill went across the street to NBC, where he thought the show might get a warm reception. It did.
Two NBC development executives, Jamie McDermott and Bob Levy, found the main character and comedic voice promising, though they thought the show should be substantially changed. "They gave us very smart notes," Mr. Hill said.
The writers revised the comedy to include NBC's suggestions, making it more a romantic triangle among three characters. Ms. Thompson was added to the project, along with the director James Burrows, who has a special deal with NBC.
The show was essentially retailored to fit NBC's prime-time comedy style and was no longer the series that CBS had rejected. "It is a considerably different show," Mr. Hill said.
That distinction was important, he said, because it undercut the notion that CBS passed on a show it clearly could use. "The show would not have been the same if it had stayed on CBS," Mr. Hill said.
Still, it is likely to be a point of some embarrassment for CBS if "Caroline" goes on to become another NBC hit; CBS has not had a break-through comedy hit since "Murphy Brown" seven years ago.
Asked whether any CBS executives had expressed some regret about "Caroline" winding up as the most highly anticipated new show on NBC's schedule, Mr. Hill said, "I'll pass on that."
But, he added: "If we're not going to be aggressive, we shouldn't be in this business. People have had a problem in the past viewing CBS Productions as a major program supplier, even though we've put on shows like 'Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,' 'Walker, Texas Ranger' and 'Dave's World' on CBS."
"Getting 'Caroline' on NBC is by far the most important statement CBS Productions has ever made about our legitimacy in this business," he added.

HEADLINE: Commencements;
Upsala Ceremony Is a Last Hurrah

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

DATELINE: EAST ORANGE, N.J., May 14

 BODY:
The band played "Pomp and Circumstance," honorary degrees were conferred and the alma mater, "Hail, Hail, Upsala," was sung.
But for Upsala College, it was the last time these traditions will be observed. Yesterday, the school graduated its final class of seniors, as 200 students received degrees from a college that is closing its doors forever. 
 For many, the day carried a bittersweet flavor. Several undergraduates had yet to complete transfers to other schools, alumni wept over memories rendered suddenly unreturnable and the professors said they planned to file for unemployment this morning.
"It's like a party and a funeral at the same time," said Darnell Grant, the student body president, who was among those who graduated. College buildings were covered with graffiti but surrounded by lovely dogwood and lilacs, as if to illustrate his point.
The commencement ended an academic year in which the college teetered on the brink of financial collapse, then pinned its hopes on a South Korean industrialist, only to be drowned in red ink and the loss of its accreditation. The day culminated with a small service in the college chapel in which the Upsala seal and official mace were ceremoniously returned to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, which founded the college in Brooklyn in 1893.
In a prayer, the Rev. Charles R. Leonard, the college pastor, said graduation day added up to the answer to a collective question, often repeated over the past nine months: "How do we get to the end of the year with all this?"
The answer, he said, was "people working out of faith, people working out of commitment."
Professors took a 40-percent pay cut this year, and also worked without pay as administrators to help keep the school running. Students accepted fewer course choices. The rating agency, the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, agreed to delay pulling the plug until May 31.
Then in March, Upsala saw its last hope dashed. The benefactor, In Tae Kim, who was elected to the board of trustees, was barred by the South Korean government from giving the school $10 million to $15 million over a five-year period. The Korean Government restricts transfers of money to nonprofit institutions outside the country.
A week later, the Essex County Improvement Authority, seeking to recover a $4.2 million loan, began foreclosure proceedings on five college buildings.
The net effect was to leave many in the college community very, very weary. "I'm just empty," said Andrea Tschemplik, a classical philosophy instructor. "I have nothing left."
David Bishop, Upsala's acting director of development, said the college's slide began with plummeting enrollments in the 1980's. An increase in students in the early 1990's was not enough to make up for debt taken on in the previous decade, he said. Then the gathering financial storm caused enrollments to begin to fall again, from 1,000 in 1993 to 650 last September to 420 this spring semester.
At the same time, the school was accepting an increasing proportion of minority students, many of whom needed financial and academic help. "We need learning laboratories to sustain what I suppose one can call the American Experiment," Warren Funk, provost and dean of the faculty, said.
But this mission was a surprise to many who had known the school as a conservative Lutheran liberal arts college.
"Some of the constituents of the college saw the place changing dramatically from the place they recognized," Dr. Funk said.
David Milgrone, an art history professor at Upsala since 1967, said the strain of going from what he calls "a classic hilltop college" to an activist institution involved in local urban issues was a tough task on limited cash.
"It was done more on a hope and a shoestring than any real resources," he said. "The tactically unfortunate error was not to work on an endowment during the years it might have been easy to do."
The ones most immediately hurt by the school's closing are undergraduates who must transfer, often losing credits. Edward Perez, 21, who has just finished his junior year, is transferring to Trenton State University, where he expects to have to repeat at least a semester's worth of courses. "I feel heartbroken inside," he said, adding that he does not expect to find the same sense of camaraderie in Trenton.
Alumni also returned yesterday to see the physical remnants of their memories. One woman came back to see the chapel where she had rehearsed thousands of times with Upsala's respected choir. The piano has already been sold, but not the organ.
John Biel, a history major from the class of 1968, was watching the commencement in an Upsala T-shirt. They are no longer sold.
"My wife says we can have an Upsala Homecoming in our backyard this fall," he said. "But I don't think that will be quite the same."

HEADLINE: Crossing Party Lines on Pollution Bill Clouds Future of Environment Issues

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: KENNEDYVILLE, Md., May 13

 BODY:
Wayne T. Gilchrest knows the tidal patterns around the mouth of the Sassafras River well enough to point out, as he walked along a marshy promontory, where the currents and the shoreline had recently shifted.
As a Republican Congressman, he is also caught up in shifting political tides as the House of Representatives debates a bill that would relax the pollution controls of the Clean Water Act. 
 Unlike most in his party, Mr. Gilchrest opposes the proposed legislation, saying that it would reverse decades of progress in cleaning up the nation's waters. Votes like his are being closely watched as the House nears its final decision on the water pollution bill, one of the country's most important environmental laws and the first to be considered by the new Congress.
Mr. Gilchrest's outspoken opposition to the bill has made him part of an unusual crosscurrent that is showing up in the debate over the measure, which the House is expected to pass as early as Tuesday. Indeed, dozens of moderate Republicans -- including people who, like Mr. Gilchrest, generally vote a fiscally tight, conservative line -- have spoken out against the bill and voted against some of its major provisions.
At the same time, an even greater number of conservative Democrats have swung the other way, and the bill is expected to prevail.
"I don't necessarily have any science background," said Mr. Gilchrest, gazing out over Chesapeake Bay, which thrusts its tentacles deep into his district and holds the region's economy in its watery grasp. "I just think this is a nice place, and I am fighting for it."
Before his election to the House in 1990, he fought in Vietnam with the Marines, taught high school social studies, lived in a wilderness cabin as a volunteer forest ranger and painted houses.
On Monday evening, when the House debates the wetlands provisions of the Clean Water Act, Mr. Gilchrest will be urging changes to the bill's language to conform to the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences, which issued a report on May 8 sharply critical of its approach to wetlands.
Because wetlands are crucial to water quality in the Chesapeake, the state of Maryland has echoed Mr. Gilchrest's objections to the House bill -- as have the local fishing industry and conservation groups. That makes his opposition relatively painless, as does his refusal to take campaign contributions from political action committees, which form the political muscle of the property developers who want the law changed.
To be sure, the conservative Democrats can argue just as passionately about wetlands as Mr. Gilchrest can. Some who want to end Federal protection over most of the nation's remaining wetlands, as the bill would do, are from states like Louisiana, where the bayous are as cherished as Chesapeake Bay is here.
"The folks who live there are special to me," said Representative Jimmy Hayes, a Democrat of Louisiana who helped write the wetlands provision. "The folks who vote there, and send me to Congress to be their voice, want somebody to say, 'Enough is enough!' and there is a difference between the waterfowl lands that we know and hunt and the lands in individual residential subdivisions that are already, for years before, of no more ecological value, but are very important, as are property rights, to the individuals who now own them."
The bill, after redefining wetlands to eliminate Federal authority over vast areas, would rank what is left according to the land's ecological value, giving the strongest protection only to wetlands of the most valued rank, like those that provide critical habitat for birds and fish.
But to limit development of these most valuable wetlands, the Government would have to compensate landowners for the resulting decline in property values, a proposition that could cost billions of dollars.
It is not the only part of the bill that Mr. Gilchrest opposes. He is also upset about changes that would ease existing requirements for cities to clean up polluted sewage that surges into streams after heavy rains, provisions that would grant waivers for industrial pollution permits, and a proposal to reduce the enforcement of limits on polluted runoff in coastal zones.
In general, the bill would add flexibility to state and local governments in meeting clean water goals, and would grant major concessions long sought by industry and agriculture.
Although many local governments and most major business groups support it, President Clinton has promised to veto it and it is unlikely to pass the Senate unless it is substantially changed.
Because of the different rules of debate in the Senate, where the loss of a few moderate Republicans makes any bill prone to a filibuster, and because it takes two-thirds of each house to override a veto, the crossover votes like those of Mr. Gilchrest and Mr. Hayes are being closely watched as signals of the emerging Congressional balance of power on environmental issues, including the Superfund bill and the Endangered Species Act.
It is not unusual in the 104th Congress -- the first in a generation to be controlled by Republicans -- for conservative Democrats to join with Republicans in voting on environmental or other social issues. But there have been few votes in which so many Republicans have defected as the preliminary votes on the Clean Water Act. Mr. Gilchrest says he believes that at least 30 Republicans have serious concerns with the bill, and that after the debate on coastal issues on Monday and Tuesday it will pass, but not by much.
The voting so far on provisions involving coastal pollution showed how powerfully local economic interests can draw Republican votes toward stronger environmental protections than those in the bill.
On May 10, 61 Republicans, including Mr. Gilchrest, voted to support Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican from upstate New York, on an amendment to strike provisions that would repeal the Coastal Zone Management Act and fold its antipollution requirements into other state programs. Republicans from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut spoke of the vote's importance for protecting the area's beaches and the tourism industry they support. Only three of the region's Republicans voted against the amendment.

EVEN CALM, RIKERS IS ON THE RAZOR'S EDGE
The inmates on Rikers Island readied for battle last November by scouring for weapons: plexiglass broken from light fixtures, razor blades attached to toothbrushes, metal wrenched from radiators. Thousands refused meals to protest cuts in services. Correction officers went on high alert. The nation's largest jail complex braced for a riot. But the explosion of New York City's nearly 20,000 inmates never happened. This year, slashings and stabbings by inmates have declined sharply as jail officials herald an era of relative peace. A1.
 
HANGING 10 COLD ONES ON LONG ISLAND
Forget Malibu. Forget about Hawaii's renowned Banzai Pipeline. The national surfing circuit has discovered Long Island. This weekend, at what its organizers billed as the first professional surfing contest around New York, dozens of surfers came to Lido Beach, on Long Island's south shore, to try to capture a share of $5,000 in prize money. The problem was that the waves didn't quite follow them. A1.

THE LATEST FEUD: GIULIANI-MCCALL
In his 16 months in office, Mayor Giuliani has had no shortage of high-profile skirmishes, whether with the Schools Chancellor, the Public Advocate or with fiscal monitors. But his current rift with the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, stands apart for its intensity, drawing some of the harshest criticism by -- and of -- the Mayor. The feud came to a boil after Mr. Giuliani suggested that the city stop financing the section of the State Comptroller's office that monitors and comments on New York City's finances. B3.
 
TALKING TRASH, AND TALKING MONEY
Why is New York City so dirty? That question was posed in this space five weeks ago, in an article with photographs of some of the city's filthiest places. In response, several readers and city officials have tried to explain why New York is not as clean as, say, Paris. As they see it, money is, as usual, the largest part of the problem: People flout rules to economize, and budget cuts impede government's efforts to stop them. That is not to say that nothing can be done. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick, B3.

AGE AND SANITY CATCH UP WITH A KILLER
Since his mother died a decade ago, only a few people have continued to visit Howard Unruh, the most infamous of the 303 criminally insane patients held in New Jersey mental hospitals. One visitor is his lawyer, James H. Klein, the public defender who has represented him since 1976.

Two people have died of pneumonia and 12 others have developed pneumonialike symptoms at the Nathaniel Witherell Home, a municipal nursing home in Greenwich, Conn.

HEADLINE: Where Violence Reigns: A special report.;
Even at a Time of Relative Calm, Rikers Stands on the Razor's Edge

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
The inmates on Rikers Island readied for battle last November by scouring for weapons: plexiglass broken from light fixtures, razor blades attached to toothbrushes, metal wrenched from radiators. Thousands refused meals to protest cuts in services. Correction officers went on high alert. The nation's largest jail complex braced for a riot.
But the explosion of New York City's nearly 20,000 inmates never happened. The coalition of inmates weakened. The tension dissipated, like a fog lifting. This year, slashings and stabbings by inmates have declined sharply as jail officials herald an era of relative peace and control. 
 Just as last fall's prediction of an uprising was overstated, however, this season's calm masks the daily drumbeat of violence on Rikers. The same volatile ingredients that nearly boiled over six months ago still exist. The number of inmates is rising, the number of officers is declining, and inmate services, including counseling and classes, have been sharply cut. The Giuliani administration's anti-crime drive and its push for austerity are colliding at the jails.
"It's a touch and go situation," said Sal F. Albanese, a member of the City Council's Public Safety Committee. "I'm sure the hierarchy of the department gets up every morning and prays that there's no problems."
The mundane daily catalogue of violent incidents is jarring: slicing fights between inmates who store razor blades in their mouths; vicious, seemingly unprovoked attacks on correction officers by inmates; officers subduing inmates with their fists.
It is a gauge of the gulf between jail and the free world that such violence persists in an atmosphere touted by officials, and some inmates, as dramatically improved.
"Before you couldn't live in jail," said Efaim Torres, a prisoner in a crowded dormitory of metal beds and cold-eyed inmates. "Now you can go to sleep and not worry."
But even with this year's drop in slashings and stabbings -- 251 for the first quarter compared with 324 for the last three months of 1994 -- the level of violence is considerably higher than in 1992, when there were 737 such incidents in the entire year.
This year's trend, said Eric M. Taylor, the jails' top officer, is the result of clamping down hard on the inmates -- more frequent weapons searches, computer analyses for pinpointing violence-prone areas, and added restraints on the most dangerous.
Yet the long-term trend continues. The inmates are more violent and better armed, reflecting the tenor of the street. The jails are increasingly strapped for resources, reflecting the state of the city government.
 
Logging the Violence
Single-Edge Razor: Weapon of Choice
 The internal daily logs of the city's jails read like a script of violence that ebbs and flows between seasons and sometimes between days.
Two weeks ago, in a seemingly typical incident, a correction officer at the James A. Thomas Center was punched by an inmate, "knocked to the floor and rendered unconscious," according to an internal report. When officers tried to strip-search the inmate he attacked again. "Officers exchanged punches with the inmate," the report said. During the fight the inmate "pulled a razor from his pants pocket."
"Inmate refused to comply with the orders to release the weapon," the report said, "so the captain kicked at the inmate's hand until the inmate released the razor blade."
The previous day, three inmates at the Thomas jail had been stabbed by four fellow inmates.
"We're just a reflection of the street," said Ralph McGrane, an assistant chief of the Department of Correction. "People get into fights over basketball and softball games on the street. It's no different here."
In that same jail, officers conducted a search on Jan. 20 and within three and a half hours found 59 razors and 11 homemade knives. Two months later, an inmate directed officers to a telephone where they unscrewed the mouthpiece and found a stash of 40 razors. During February and March, officers recovered 1,436 weapons from all of the city's jails.
"The single-edged razor, that's the 9-millimeter of jail," said Norman Seabrook, a security officer on Rikers Island. "It'll cut you open like a hot knife going through butter. These guys have more weapons than they do on the street."
To catch smuggled weapons, visitors are searched before entering the jails and employees pass through metal detectors, or magnometers. But in October, when Correction Department investigators conducted a surprise check of the staff entrances at nine Rikers jails, they found the magnometers were not on at three of the jails, according to a report on the examination. At six of the jails, investigators noted, the staff members were not accustomed to regular searches. Officers have since been retrained in security procedures, an official said.
Only the inmates have the weapons in the jails, but the aggression on Rikers goes both ways, and beyond.
The department is investigating a March 25 incident in which a Rikers pharmacy assistant, Vincent James, was apparently mistaken for an inmate on the grounds of the island as he arrived for work. He was detained by three officers and a correction captain. In a statement released by Local 1199 of the National Health and Human Services Employees Union, Mr. James said the captain "took her nightstick from her belt and struck me three times perpendicularly directly into my abdomen."
Even after Mr. James identified himself, the statement said, one officer "put a thick glove on his right hand and forcibly held my face with his gloved hand. He pressed my face in a downward position. I felt as though my head was about to be pushed through my chest cavity." Mr. James was eventually released but told by the officers to remain silent about the incident, the statement said.
The logs report daily conflicts between inmates and officers. Often officers respond by punching inmates.
On April 4, an inmate assaulted a correction officer and the officer "responded with several punches to the face and body."
On April 5, two inmates "refused to cease fighting" and when officers "employed body holds, the noted inmates resisted, and staff employed punches terminating the incident."
On April 8, when an officer told an inmate to hang up a telephone "the inmate refused and pushed the officer in the chest area."
"The officer responded with one punch to the facial area" and then put the inmate in a cell with the help of other officers.
Jonathan Chasan, a Legal Aid Society lawyer, who has brought several successful lawsuits charging brutality by officers at Rikers, said officers are supposed to use the least injurious form of restraint necessary, but the guideline is often ignored. He said the department lacks adequate internal monitors on staff actions.
 
A 6th Borough
 A Neighborhood Of Jails
 Rikers Island is like the city's sixth borough, an island between the Bronx and Queens, populated by the accused and the convicted.
The majority are detainees, legally innocent and awaiting trial, some locked up for lack of a few hundred dollars in bail money. There are parole violators serving short sentences, and others are recently convicted, awaiting bus trips to more permanent addresses in upstate prisons. About 15,000 city inmates are at Rikers, with an additional 400 to 500 at borough detention centers. The island is a haphazard collection of 10 jails, each its own neighborhood.
The Rose M. Singer Center, the women's jail, for example, is such a cheery version of incarceration that one wonders if the metal mesh on the windows is meant to keep people in or out. Women march to lunch singing about bettering their lives. Searches for contraband turn up "basically excessive clothing," said the warden, Jannie Poullard.
More places are like the James A. Thomas Center, which looks every inch a jail. Its long, narrow cell blocks with 75 cells apiece stacked three tiers high reverberate with the dull murmurs of idle inmates and the sharp clang of metal gates. On a crisp spring day, the air inside stings from a morning shower of disinfectant.
The inmate traffic across the sloping bridge from Queens to Rikers Island is reaching record proportions -- up 20,000, to 130,000 this year -- even as the ranks of officers, counselors and teachers on the island grows thinner.
With the crush of prisoners and cuts in resources, the Giuliani administration is trying to rally its corps of correction officers.
On a recent tour of the jails, arranged for The New York Times after six months of requests, signs of morale boosters were evident. They range from the substantive -- a new emphasis on cleanliness -- to the symbolic -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani now visits injured officers in the hospital -- to the simplistic -- the staff entrance of the Otis Bantum Correctional Center displays the "11 Commandments for an Enthusiastic Team."
Commandment 5: "Speak positively about each other and about your organization at every opportunity." Commandment 11: "Have fun."
 
Budget Squeeze
Economy Moves Anger Inmates
 Just as violence is an immediate threat to inmates and staff, the continual budget squeeze threatens the equilibrium of the jails.
Last fall's food strikes were prompted by reports of planned reductions in classes, counseling service and drug treatment and a change in the nightly "lock in" time to 9 P.M. from 11 P.M., all changes driven by the city's budget crisis. Only the change in the lock-in time, a volatile issue among inmates, was dropped.
For next year, the mayor's budget proposal calls for a $56 million decrease in the department's current $761 million budget and cuts of 749 officers and 228 civilian employees.
No correction officers have been hired since 1991, and the number has fallen by more than 1,000 in the last two years, to 9,529. Meanwhile, annual admission to city jails is rising, 18 percent in the last year.
With the officer-to-inmate ratio diminished, said Stan Israel, the president of the Correction Officers Benevolent Association, inmates, and particularly leaders of jailhouse gangs, have become more powerful. "The price of peace is to let the gangs flourish, and I think one day they are going to pay the price," Mr. Israel said.
The strain is obvious. The city is only able to staff its jails with officers working overtime. The overtime budget last year was $88 million and this year is $89 million, with a planned decline to $72 million next year.
"These are guys who are doing a thankless job," said William Booth, the chairman of the Board of Correction, which oversees the department. "When they have to work double and triple shifts their efficiency goes down. They can't be as alert or effective."
Inmate services have been cut sharply. About 900 drug treatment beds were eliminated by the Giuliani administration in the last year, although some are now being restored, and even larger jails, with more than 1,000 inmates, have just one inmate counselor each.
At the Anna M. Kross jail, inmates in a crowded dormitory said that other than one hour of outdoor recreation early each morning, they are locked in the dorm and the adjacent television room all day, sleeping, listening to cassette players, talking. They said they even eat meals on their beds.
At the George R. Vierno Center, an inmate, Mark Lee, in jail on weapons charges, lives with a group of inmates on a clean, sunny cell block that has regular meetings to discuss substance abuse and self-esteem problems. The inmates set rules for the living area and even vote before switching the television channel. While his cell block is peaceful and productive, he knows much of the jail is not and that idleness can breed unrest.
"We understand that a lot of the cuts are for budget reasons," Mr. Lee said, "but you can't just lock up a lot of people and not give them anything to do."
 
More With Less
Seeking Ways To Cut Expenses
 The correction problem has fallen to Michael P. Jacobson, who was appointed acting commissioner in January, after Anthony J. Schembri resigned during an inquiry into whether he met the city's residency requirement.
It's among the most difficult budgeting tasks in city government. The department has little say over the size of its population. The Police Department controls the flow into jails by making arrests, and those numbers are rising. The courts and district attorneys control the flow out of the jails by disposing of cases.
But to meet its tight budget for next year, the department is counting on the city to cut the average time in jail for accused criminals by 6 days, to 40 days.
Speeding up the city's criminal case system has long been a concern of various agencies, and there has been some success at doing so in recent years. But without significant success soon to reduce the jails' average daily population, the department could face even deeper cuts in staff. Mr. Jacobson fears that could threaten security.
"I don't think we can afford to lose much more uniform staff with the current population," said Mr. Jacobson, who is also the probation commissioner and a former Dinkins administration budget official.
The department is reviewing all of its operations, searching for ways to save money. Paradoxically, that may mean restoring some inmate services, like drug treatment, and hiring several hundred more correction officers as a way of reducing overtime costs, Mr. Jacobson said.
He said the department will use 600 new jail beds, due to open in the summer, as drug treatment centers, replacing two-thirds of the treatment beds cut over the last year. Mr. Jacobson said running the new jail units as drug treatment centers requires fewer officers, and will save money.
Some changes save money and reduce violence. For example, a new telephone system ends inmate calls after six minutes, cutting down on fights over phones and saving a projected $2 million in telephone bills.
In making some changes, the department is likely to face a fight from inmate advocates. Officials want relief from court orders and consent decrees that govern all aspects of jail life, from the schedule for window washing to the time inmates are locked in for the night.
"My concern is they might attempt to undo 15 or 20 years of work aimed at insuring the humane treatment of inmates in city jails," said John Boston, the director of the Legal Aid Society's prisoner rights project. "People who are incarcerated should be treated humanely. If the city says it doesn't have enough money to treat them humanely, they should have less people in jail."
One challenge is expected to come when the department seeks to increase jail space by housing sentenced inmates in a part of an old jail that a judge has already found unfit for detainees awaiting trial.
Another court ruling likely to be challenged requires a full medical exam, including chest X-rays, on any new inmate, even if the inmate is re-entering jail after having left a few days before.
But rules more basic to the operation of the jails are to be reviewed, including staffing levels and other security matters.
Mr. Jacobson said the city is not trying to evade constitutional responsibilities, but it simply wants to operate the jails within its means.
"We're not saying that's it, we're just going to feed them corn dogs," Mr. Jacobson said.
Yet others, like Mr. Booth, the Board of Correction chairman, fear that a new round of cuts and adjustments could revive unrest, threatening what he called Rikers Island's "relative quiet."
"I hope it continues," Mr. Booth said, "but I don't think it will."

If You're Talking Trash, It's Usually About Money

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
WHY is New York City so dirty?
That question was posed in this space five weeks ago, in an article with photographs of some of the city's filthiest places. In response, several readers and city officials have tried to explain why New York is not as clean as, say, Paris. 
 As they see it, money is, as usual, the largest part of the problem: people flout rules to economize, and budget cuts impede government's efforts to stop them. "You've got greed and avarice at the forefront," said Emory N. Jackson, president of We Care About New York, a citizens' group that combats graffiti and litter.
That is not to say that nothing can be done. Most of the sites pictured in the article on April 10 have been cleaned up, and so have many of the city's highways.
But a larger problem remains: chronic and illegal dumping. The city picks up residential trash, but businesses are supposed to hire licensed carters to collect their trash. That can be expensive. So many businesses, explained Mr. Jackson, "hire Joe-from-the-neighborhood, who will collect the trash and dump in out-of-the-way places."
Many of those unlicensed, freelance carters, building contractors and illicit automobile "chop shops" routinely turn vacant lots and isolated streets into garbage dumps. Why not take the rubbish to a legal dump? In part because the city charges so much for dumping at its last remaining landfill, Fresh Kills on Staten Island -- $40 per cubic yard.
That is double what most other landfills charge. Fresh Kills is running out of space, so a few years ago the city decided to raise its rate to encourage carters to take their rubbish out of town. For instance, it costs up to $320 to dump the contents of a typical Econoline van at Fresh Kills. So the vacant lot around the corner often becomes a junkyard.
"WE find oil cans, tires, paper, dogs, refrigerators, everything," says Charles Diaz, a supervisor of the city's Special Cleaning Squad. Mr. Diaz and his crew of nine sanitation workers were cleaning out the detritus of illegal dumping last Thursday just north of the Riverside Drive exit of the West Side Highway.
The crew belongs to a squad of 21 special cleaners assigned to the city's worst messes. "We go where the trouble is," Fredric Ciena, a 10-year veteran, said. But the rubbish inevitably returns, and now, because of budget cuts, the squad visits each of the city's 59 sanitation districts just once a year instead of two or three times, as it once did.
Cumulative budget cuts have decimated the district crews that used to supplement the special cleanups. Lucian Chalfen, spokesman for the Sanitation Department, said that in 1987 the city had 8,748 district cleaners. Today it has 2,202.
Still, it is apparent that when the city wants to clean up its act, it can. A return visit to the places that were such a mess five weeks ago proved that. Many had been improved, including an abandoned exit off the Henry Hudson Parkway, still littered but no longer a pile of rusting cars, and some park land behind a ball field between Linden Boulevard and South Conduit Avenue in Queens.
THE Queens site had been piled high with dumped tires. Last Thursday, it still had construction junk on it, but the tires were gone. "Usually, if the media calls attention to something, somehow or other it manages to get cleaned up," said Anne Grossberg, district manager of Community Board 10 in Queens.
A park on the Lower East Side, next to the annex of Seward Park High School, was cleaned out after this reporter telephoned Henry Stern, the Parks Commissioner, in connection with last month's article. He checked it out and ordered it cleared. "It was a total mess," he conceded.
Should it take media attention to clean up a park or a lot or a highway? Elliot G. Sander, the Transportation Commissioner, said that the Giuliani administration's highway cleanup was planned independently of the article in The Times or a subsequent article about highways in The Daily News. "We have a ways to go," Mr. Sander said. "But we're making progress."
Others readily concede that press attention can have a direct bearing on which problem gets attention and when. "There's a kind of rough triage," Mr. Stern said.
Mr. Chalfen asked, "Does it take media attention? It takes some attention. It's a big city."
The tire dump behind the ball field in Queens is a case in point. It's a favorite dump site for contractors and chop shops and is periodically cleaned out. Then the site fills up again because the city doesn't have enough money to patrol it, Ms. Grossberg said.
"When were you there last?" she asked. "Yesterday? Try it again today."

Sweaty palms and stage fright? No problem. A word-for-word text and a Teleprompter to read it from? No need. Slides on the big screen above the stage? Now the architectural historian VINCENT SCULLY is worried.
Mr. Scully is scheduled to give a speech tonight in the Concert Hall at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Not just any speech, but the 24th Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, the Government's highest recognition of intellectual achievement in the humanities. Mr. Scully, the Sterling Professor of Art History Emeritus at Yale University, was chosen by the National Council on the Humanities, the 26-member advisory board of the National Endowment for the Humanities. He will also receive an honorarium of $10,000. 
 "I don't write speeches," Mr. Scully said. "If I read a talk, it's terrible. And if I tape a talk and try to transcribe it, it sounds like Gertrude Stein on a bad morning. The slides are my notes."
But "they use very hot bulbs" in the projector, he said. The bulbs are so hot that the slides could melt before the audience's eyes, leaving him -- there really is no other word here -- speechless. To prevent that, technicians have mounted them in heat-resistant glass carriers.
Even though it is the Jefferson Lecture, Mr. Scully is not going to talk about Thomas Jefferson, who dabbled in architecture. "I thought the lecture to give here is about contemporary problems," Mr. Scully said.
Still, Jefferson's Virginia will figure in Mr. Scully's talk. He has slides of urban renewal in Roanoke, Va. A reporter for The Roanoke Times and World News sent him articles describing how urban renewal had uprooted Roanoke's black residents. "In the 50's and 60's, when architects and planners and politicians did this, we didn't know what a neighborhood was," Mr. Scully said. "It's amazing how much anthropology had been done in the South Seas, and yet we didn't know what happens when inner-city communities are destroyed."

HEADLINE: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY;
Study Says Japan's Executives Are Behind in Computing

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Only a few years ago, Japan was supposedly ready to leap past the United States as a technological superpower. That assumption now appears exaggerated, and a new study provides a possible explanation: Many of Japan's executives are technological illiterates.
Japanese executives are less likely than their American counterparts to use a computer, and they are less satisfied with the results they get from information technology, according to the study by the Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo and Fuld & Company in Cambridge, Mass. 
 The study, "Information Technology's Role: A U.S.-Japan Competitiveness Gap," was released today. Its results are based on questionnaires answered last fall by 373 senior executives at large companies in Japan and the United States.
Japanese companies, of course, are world leaders in the production of consumer electronics and many technologically advanced components for the computer industry, like color screens for notebook computers.
"But what really surprised me was the gap between what the Japanese make and what Japanese executives use," said Leonard Fuld, president of Fuld & Company, a research firm. "There seems to be technological illiteracy in the executive suites in Japan."
While 64 percent of the American executives said they must use computers in their jobs, only 8 percent of the Japanese executives replied that computer use was essential for them.
"American executives are lugging laptop computers with them wherever they go," Mr. Fuld noted. "Japanese executives, by and large, do not."
American executives were also more likely than Japanese executives to be directly involved in the setup and management of information systems in their companies. Sixty-eight percent of the Americans said they were involved in the planning and use of information technology in their businesses, compared with 36 percent of the Japanese.
In Japan, Mr. Fuld said, information technology seems to be regarded as "a glorified bookkeeping tool." By contrast, he said, in American companies the technology is used much more to gather, analyze and distribute marketing information and as an aid in making management decisions.
Perhaps the most debatable aspect of the Fujitsu-Fuld study is its assumption that the resistance among Japanese executives to using new technology has much to do with changes in competitiveness. Economists say the attitudes of Japanese managers toward technology have changed little in recent years, but the yen has strengthened sharply, making Japanese exports more costly abroad.

HEADLINE: Apple Offering Newton Rebates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: CUPERTINO, Calif., May 14

 BODY:
Apple Computer Inc. is offering rebates of as much as $100 to buyers of its miniature computer, the Newton Messagepad.
The rebates on the hand-held computers, which sell for about $600, run through July 31. Customers who buy just the Messagepad are eligible for a $50 rebate. Those who buy extra storage, a fax modem or other "qualified" accessories can get a $100 rebate, the company said. 
 The company said it hoped to increase sales of the latest version of its paperback-sized computer, which was introduced on Jan. 27. The machines store telephone numbers, appointment calendars and notes.
Last week, the market researcher Dataquest Inc. reported that Apple sold about 60,000 Newtons in 1994, giving it a 15 percent share of the market for hand-held computers. The Hewlett-Packard Company leads the market for hand-held computers with a 27 percent share, Dataquest said.

HEADLINE: Essay;
The G.O.P. Delivers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Republicans may play a mean, low-down political trick on Democrats still railing at proposals to stem the tide of red ink: to put the budget submitted to Congress a few months ago by President Clinton up for a vote.
You may remember his punt-and-pray, you-go-first budget -- not only was it "dead on arrival"; it was dead before sending. 
 That was because Clinton made few choices needed to slow the growth of the deficit. Instead, he projected another trillion dollars in debt over the next five years (even assuming steady growth and low interest rates, which won't happen if such Government borrowing continues apace).
Everyone knew the Clinton budget was not to be taken seriously; it was his way of saying "you won the election; you balance the budget." Rarely do Presidents so completely abdicate their economic responsibility. He changed "the President proposes, the Congress disposes" to "the Congress proposes and disposes while the President treads water."
However, to ingratiate himself with the voters who rejected his party, he included a me-too tax cut in that budget. That compounded his mistake.
Now we are engaged in a great budgetary war. Contrary to Clinton's expectations, the feisty G.O.P. House and the sobersided G.O.P. Senate met his challenge and came up with what Democrats considered impossible: seven years to budget balance. Nor do the G.O.P. proposals "cut" actual spending; they follow the precept of the Civil War general to a gunner to "elevate them sights a little lower."
But it is undoubtedly a Mort Sahl budget. ("Is there anybody I haven't offended?") The lobbies of geezers and greens, of veterans and farmers, of root casuists at Justice and corporate welfare queens of Commerce are stunned.
You can feel the moral high ground move. Having smugly asked "what's your specific alternative?" -- and having received a serious answer -- Democrats now find themselves embarrassed at being asked the same question.
All they have in the way of an answer is the old Clinton budget, which won't do. If Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich bring the coagulated Pablum of that Panetta-Rivlin compromise to a vote, Congressional Democrats will be forced to desert Clinton, lest they go on record as deficit doves.
That's why you can sense a Democratic fallback position in preparation. Farewell to Clinton's long-promised "middle-class tax cut," now seen by Congressional Democrats as a wrongheaded response to the electoral debacle.
Those unreturned billions will be proposed to be sprinkled over endangered liberal programs -- national service's subsidized volunteers, public broadcasting, education under Federal standards, the arts, another veterans' hospital, etc. -- to shore up core constituencies and show Democrats resisting this year's sanhedrin of skinflints.
This means the debate is no longer between budget balancers and the defenders of debt. It is now between balancers including a tax cut (with spending restraints in the near years) and balancers without a tax cut (with a slowing of spending back-end-loaded). That's a huge shift in argument, as borrowing is no longer seen as a gift to our old but as a theft from our young.
The best way to redirect our nation is with the stronger Government spending restraint plus tax rate reduction; as Napoleon advised a temporizing general, "If you are going to take Vienna, take Vienna." However, with the veto power still in Democratic hands, conservatives may have to settle for spending restraint first, tax cuts later -- in effect, taking the suburbs now and the citadel in 1997.
What is the immediate political effect of this rightward shift in the debate?
It means Perot voters no longer need a third party to express their disgust with the unwillingness of major parties to come to grips with the deficit. Of five United-we-standers, three are likely to go Republican, one Democratic, one home.
Smart Democrats understand this, which is why Bill Clinton keeps taking credit for having reduced the deficit last year. It is why Democrats are now abandoning the "deficit as percentage of G.N.P." weaseling and are scrambling to get aboard the anti-deficit bandwagon. And it is why Republicans are so eager to make certain you know the impetus for budget balance comes from them.

HEADLINE: The Brownstone Storytellers;
A Colony of Writers Is Growing in Park Slope

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
Colin Harrison, author and editor, lives with his wife, Kathryn Harrison, novelist, in a brownstone a block from Thomas Boyle, writer of thrillers, who lives in a brownstone a block from Luc Sante, writer, and his wife, Melissa Holbrook Pierson, the same.
Mary Morris, novelist and travel writer, lives with her husband, Larry O'Connor, editor and writer, in a brownstone across the street from Penny Kaganoff, senior editor, not far from Paul Auster, novelist, and his wife, Siri Hustvedt, ditto. 
 Ms. Kaganoff found her dry cleaner in Park Slope through Mr. Harrison's last book. Jennie Fields's block in Park Slope is the hero of her new novel. Gail Hochman, literary agent, says one in every 20 book proposals she is sent these days hails from the same place: Her neighborhood, Park Slope. "I think I'm the only person in Park Slope who hasn't published a novel with a major publishing house," mused David Ravel, who, as manager of the Community Bookstore on Seventh Avenue in the heart of "the Slope," is in a position to know.
Park Slope, the tidy trapezoid that sweeps gently northwestward from the westernmost reaches of Prospect Park, is becoming New York's Left Bank, home to a conflux of writers, editors, publishers and literary types.
Most have rolled in over the past 15 years, with the pace seeming to pick up over the last five. Many are emigres from Manhattan's Upper West Side, lured by affordable brownstones, space for families, wisteria in spring.
They say they have found there the kind of neighborhood that Manhattan no longer seems to offer -- unpretentious, but with great physical charm, a true community, cohesive but tolerant, and just an F train ride away.
For a few, their adoptive home has also become their Muse. Park Slope is surfacing now in their books -- as a symbol of domesticity or of continuity, a kind of urban idyll, perhaps a celebration of life.
"I find the Slope to be heart-breakingly beautiful," said Mr. Harrison, who set much of his last novel, "Bodies Electric" (Crown, 1993), there. "If you walk along some of the streets at dusk, when kids are out on the stoops and people are walking home, there's a marvelous sense of civilization.
"Life feels organized and perceptible again in an otherwise chaotic, information-rotted world. People love that," he said. "And I think writers in particular are very sensitive to the chaos of the world. It's their job to order it. Maybe being in the Slope is somehow a balm."
Like much of Brooklyn, Park Slope has inspired writers before. Pete Hamill grew up there in the 1940's, but it was a different place -- a place he described in "A Drinking Life" (Back Bay/Little, Brown, 1994) as one of Irish bars and steel-wheeled trolleys squealing along Seventh Avenue into the night.
The roots of the current reincarnation reach back to the late 1960's, when Manhattan real-estate prices seemed to shoot through the roof. Writers and artists ventured into Brooklyn, stumbled upon Park Slope and discovered a mother lode of Victorian brownstones, available and cheap.
The houses had been built for prosperous members of the upper bourgeoisie. Some had been converted into rooming houses when the neighborhood declined with suburban flight, but many had remained in the same family for generations -- one of the largest, best-preserved, Victorian-row-house neighborhoods in the city.
They appealed especially to younger people and writers, for whom "the suburbs seemed to hold a special horror," Mr. Hamill wrote in a magazine article in the early 1970's. Houses began selling for as little as $14,000. Prices have risen steadily -- to $40,000, then $200,0000, and now, $450,000 and above.
"The New People, as they are called, saw Brooklyn fresh," Mr. Hamill wrote back then, and the observation seems no less true today. "They saw Brooklyn in a way that we had not seen it when we were young, and they saw it in a way that Brooklyn had not seen itself, perhaps . . . "
By the late 1970's, hardware stores were selling polyurethane varnish by the drum. When the neighborhood's second bookstore opened in 1985, publishing industry people remember how it shrewdly began placing home-renovation books so they could be seen through the front window.
"Suddenly, every time I walked out on the street I would see another face from a company where I was working," said Barbara Grossman, senior vice president and publisher of Viking, a 15-year resident. "Suddenly, it was like the Hamptons in Brooklyn."
Now Mary Morris bumps into Donald Antrim, who wrote "Elect Mr. Robinson for a Better World" (Viking, 1993), under the ceiling fans at Ozzie's, one of the neighborhood's many coffeehouses. Or she runs into Ian Frazier, whose most recent book is "Family" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1994), in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.
Ann Rittenberg, a literary agent, counts seven writers on her block, as well as two agents and "something like 40 kids under age 7." Kathryn Cullen-DuPont, a poet who also writes about women's history, met her agent at a Parent-Teacher Association gathering because their daughters were best friends.
When the two women ended up writing a book together, "Women's Suffrage in America: An Eyewitness History" (Facts on File, 1992), they dedicated it to their daughters, who had served as messengers, carting drafts and notes to and from school in their backpacks, swapping them at lunch.
Their school, the Berkeley Carroll School, has so many students with writer parents that its annual holiday book fair to raise money for its library has turned into a miniature Frankfurt Book Fair, with more than a dozen well-known parent authors lined up at tables signing their books.
And when one parent's novel, "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," by Jennie Fields, was recently being considered for publication, two other parents at Berkeley Carroll, a private school, were doing the considering: Michelle Sidrane, president and publisher of the Crown Publishing Group, and Ms. Grossman of Viking.
There are now four bookstores in a 15-block stretch of Seventh Avenue in the Slope. The Community Bookstore holds standing-room-only readings at a rate of two or three a month. Even the stoop sales are remarkably literate. "I've seen things like bound galleys," said Mr. Sante, the writer.
Writers' reasons for choosing Park Slope seem to be a mix of economic, aesthetic and intellectual. They find it affordable, beautiful and historically interesting. They also find it user friendly for people who work at home.
A spare room for a studio is not out of the question. The Brooklyn Public Library and the Brooklyn Museum are a short walk away. The coffeehouses don't mind campers with portable computers. And streets are alive during the day.
Asked to describe why they live there, people talk about their houses and their gardens and walking their children to school. They mention dogwood trees, original door knobs, barbecues, the woodpecker in the maple tree out front.
Some resisted at first. When the moving van pulled up outside Ms. Morris's Manhattan apartment, she told her husband it was dirty, send it away. It seemed inconceivable, she now says, to leave behind Manhattan's energy and life.
It took her two years to come to love living in Park Slope. She dates her change of heart to a snowstorm in late 1991. The cash machines had broken, she had dinner guests coming and so she went with her checkbook from store to store.
"I had to get fish, cheese, wine, dessert, whatever," she remembered. "Nobody would take my check. They said, 'What do you want? No problem. When you come back, you pay us.' "
What Ms. Morris appreciates most now is the mix of bucolic and urban: She can descend into the subway and roam the city, then spend hours in the botanic garden and "walk quietly home to check my tomato plants."
"I can be contemplative and not feel that I'm off in the country, and then feel that I can go out in the world," she said. "That blend is very satisfactory for a writer. Because you need that inner quiet."
William Malloy and his wife, Claire Zion, both publishing executives, were sharing a Manhattan tenement with a kitchen shower back in 1984 when a publishing friend of Ms. Zion's vacated an apartment in Park Slope.
Mr. Malloy's sole experience with Brooklyn had been a jaunt over the Brooklyn Bridge, just to say he had done it. But the couple went out to see the apartment anyway, one spring day when the cherry trees were in bloom.
"We walked up from Ninth Street to Garfield Place," said Mr. Malloy, now editor in chief for The Mysterious Press. "I remember looking around with my jaw hanging slack and saying, 'How come I didn't know about this?' "
They took the apartment, five times the size of their last one. It had a porcelain bathtub, with clawed feet, the size of a small pool. Mr. Malloy took to spending two hours every Saturday and Sunday wallowing with a book.
In recent years, Park Slope has turned up increasingly in people's writing -- in Thomas Boyle's trilogy of Brooklyn-based thrillers, in Ms. Morris's short stories, in works by Paul Auster, Richard Cohen and Ms. Fields.
In Mr. Boyle's books, gentrification is a backdrop. One character is a serial killer of mixed race who was driven crazy by a childhood spent fleeing from one neighborhood to the next each time writers moved in.
In Ms. Morris's stories, Park Slope symbolizes what she called in an interview "domesticity and a certain tedium of domestic life." Among other things, she has explored the ambivalent bonds between neighbors.
Ms. Fields's novel, coming out next spring, is about two people who fall in love in adjoining brownstones. It is set on her block on Eighth Street, the history of which has captured her imagination ever since she moved in.
Like Colin Harrison, Ms. Fields chose a title that echoes Walt Whitman. In his poem, "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," Mr. Whitman pondered the ebb and flow of people between Manhattan and Brooklyn over decades and decades of time.
"To me, those brownstones represent the flow of life," Ms. Fields said in an interview. "I think it's really appealing for a writer to see that. It's a celebration of life, that life goes on, no matter what, through 100 years."
Park Slope is even the setting of a movie, "Smoke," due out next month. It was shot in and around the neighborhood and is based on a story by Mr. Auster, who describes the film as "an homage to this neighborhood."
"I think it celebrates a sense of community and a sense of tolerance," said Mr. Auster, who moved to Park Slope in the late 1980's. "And also the wonderful verbal gifts of everybody around me."

'BROOKLYN-QUEENS DISTRESS WAY'
By Thomas Boyle
 "He decended the stoop and headed down the slope. The Yuppies and Buppies were out in full force, coming and going from the IRT station at Grand Army Plaza, rollerbladeing, biking, jogging. Desmond often wondered why, at any given time, most of Park Slope seemed not to be at work."

'ADJUSTMENTS'
By Mary Morris
 "I had fallen in love with this house the first time I saw it. I loved the stone steps that led up to it, the open parlor with the mahogany trim, the backyard with its brick patio and flowing rosebushes. I loved the staircase and the gaslight out front. I knew the moment I walked in that I would live here. . . We had thought of everything when we bought the house, but we didn't think about who our neighbors would be."
To be published in July by Doubleday as part of skin deep (Women on Race: An Anthology)"
 
'CROSSING BROOKLYN FERRY'
By Jennie Fields
 "If you turn right at the Lucky Pub you'll be on Eighth Street. Walk into its silence. Feel it: the rich solidity of the hundred year old bluestone sidewalks, the slope of the hillas it eases up toward Prospect Park, the Norwegian maples, which in summer are so thick the rain doesn't come through, And the houses, a soldierly sameness that can't help but please you, beginning to light now with tables being set for dinner, mail being read."
To be published next year by William Morrow. (Photographs by Jose R. Lopez/The New York Times)(pg. B1)

HEADLINE: Trouble for Teaching Hospitals

 BODY:
The quality of American health care -- unarguably the best in the world -- is under siege. Republicans released budget plans last week that would cut subsidies to teaching hospitals that train doctors and perform clinical research. Meanwhile, the private market, whose reform Congress bungled last year, has been doing the same. The two-pronged assault is alarming.
American physicians provide innovative, technically advanced care whose quality can be traced in part to generous subsidies for basic research that Congress has provided through the National Institutes for Health. The N.I.H. estimates that the Senate budget plan could reduce these subsidies for non-AIDS research over the next seven years by as much as 25 percent; the cut is deeper if inflation is taken into account. 
 The proposed N.I.H. cuts are easily identified and will be subject to public scrutiny. Two other threats are harder to spot.
The Federal Government, when reimbursing hospitals for treating Medicare patients, pays an average of 30 percent extra if treatment is provided in a teaching hospital. The extra payments cover costs associated with training doctors and translating basic research into clinical practice -- to develop, for example, innovative surgical procedures or drug therapies. Under the G.O.P. budgets, these payments could fall by between 30 and 60 percent.
The other dagger aimed at teaching hospitals comes from the private sector. Private insurers have also paid more for patients treated in teaching hospitals. That practice is ending. Wielding new-found market power, health maintenance organizations and other managed-care groups are driving down hospital rates. They refuse to pay for training or research that does not directly benefit their enrollees. Private markets will not pay for public goods, like research, that will eventually benefit everyone but not necessarily anyone in particular.
The assault on training and clinical research is especially grave for New York City, whose teaching hospitals train about 15 percent of the nation's medical residents. When the Democrats controlled Congress, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York was chairman of the powerful Finance Committee, these teaching hospitals were well protected. But New York's Republican Senator, Alfonse D'Amato, is chairman of an unrelated committee.
The solution to the problem is surely not to stymie the growth of competitive managed-care plans. They remain the best way to insure high-quality, affordable care. But Congress does need to attend to the special needs of teaching hospitals, a national resource worth preserving.
One way is to impose a tax on health insurance premiums, and direct the money to training and research programs. This would require the G.O.P. to admit that not every tax is evil. A less costly approach might be to subsidize doctors-in-training directly. Congress could fund N.I.H. to distribute fellowships to medical school graduates to help pay for their residency programs. Congress could also reduce subsidies for low-priority clinical research by requiring hospitals to submit proposals to the N.I.H. for funding on a competitive basis.
The Republicans are right that teaching hospitals are riddled with waste and turn out the wrong mix of doctors -- too many specialists and too few primary care doctors. Many such hospitals, in New York and elsewhere, ought to shrink, if not close. But these truths do not justify a mindless assault that threatens to bury the programs that turn out the best-trained physicians in the world.

HEADLINE: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: Information by the Gallon;
As Desktop Video Approaches, Is the Office Ready?

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
On Chase Manhattan Bank's new trading floor in Manhattan, the desk of Paul G. Farrell, managing director of foreign exchange trading, is an information arsenal.
There's a two-foot-wide telephone console; a microphone and video camera for communicating with other traders on the vast floor, and an array of five video monitors for, among many other things, Chase's interoffice E-mail, real-time prices on dozens of currencies, text from four news wires and the cable television channels CNBC and Cable News Network. 
 It isn't enough.
Mr. Farrell and his lieutenants recently began testing a new video service from Reuters that delivers speeches, news conferences and other potentially market-moving events directly to their computer monitors. Rather than waiting for the news services to tap out the first headlines, Mr. Farrell reasons, his traders will be able to interpret events as they unfold. And without even taking their eyes off their trading screens, Mr. Farrell hopes, his currency team can respond to world developments before its competitors have time to react.
"In this business, time is money," Mr. Farrell said one recent trading day, as the screens flickered around him. "It always has been."
And that is precisely the premise behind Reuters Financial Television and a handful of other new video services promising to turn the computer screens of Wall Street into picture windows on the world. The services come not only from financial specialists like Reuters, Bloomberg Financial Markets and Dow Jones, but also from mass-market generalists like the CNN network of Turner Broadcasting System and NBC.
For Mr. Farrell and his counterparts at other financial houses, only time and testing will tell whether these new services -- roughly the video equivalents of business news wires -- actually pay off.
Some skeptical managers argue that turning a portion of the computer screen into a television set, even for specialized financial information, will be a time-wasting distraction. And, others wonder, even if the services bring incremental benefits, will they justify prices that can run hundreds of dollars a month per desktop?
Mr. Farrell, for whom millions of dollars can ride on every uptick or downtick of the currency market, is an eager member of this new television audience. "The more information the better," he said.
Right now, most of these offerings do little more than transmit live video feeds because of technical limitations, whether within the services themselves or in the customers' office computer networks. But the idea is to enable users eventually to select video business reports from a menu, similar to the way that text-based news wires now offer articles from data bases that often have several months or more of archival material.
Such services represent the news industry's most aggressive test yet of a basic thesis of the so-called interactive media: that people want the same control over television news that they have come to enjoy for all the information streaming into their computers.
The media companies pursuing this business sense that the wealthy news hounds of the financial world may represent the first big market for customized video news. But for now, the services are so new, and the customers still so few, the market remains largely theoretical.
"As in any news service, we don't expect major penetration until years down the road," said Thomas S. Rogers, executive vice president in charge of business development at NBC, which has two entries in the field: NBC Professional and PFN/ First Call.
Neither of the NBC services has more than a handful of large corporate customers yet. But since NBC's desktop video operation is primarily a repackaging of financially relevant news that has been gathered by NBC's broadcast affiliates, the CNBC cable channel and NBC's new entertainment and news networks in Asia and Europe, Mr. Rogers added, the operating costs are bearable now and can only get more so.
 "It's the same cost to reach the first subscriber as to reach the one- millionth subscriber," he said.
Video news is nothing new to financial firms, of course. Ever since CNN started broadcasting world crises live in the early 1980's, television sets have been as much a staple of trading floors as pizza and off-color jokes. Most of the sets are now tuned to either CNN or to CNBC, acable business-and-finance channel.
But typically, unless there is a big story, the sound is turned down and the picture is ignored. The new desktop video services take a more direct approach.
In October, CNN teamed up with the Intel Corporation to offer a version of its cable news programming for delivery to personal computers. Subscribers can watch CNN in a window in a corner of their monitor's screen.
Or they can program their computers to capture and store a half-hour of "CNN Headline News," and selectively view it later by calling up a menu of the individual news stories and use the mouse to click on the headlines of the items they want to view.
In contrast, Dow Jones, NBC and Reuters are hoping eventually to reinvent video news as a computer software tool as valuable to the financial community as spreadsheets and stock quotes.
The three companies offer coverage of specific events selected for their presumed relevance to the financial community, like Congressional testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. These and other potentially market-moving events are broadcast live, while news conferences or reports of lesser import might be tape-delayed. Between events, the screen is blank.
But Dow Jones, Reuters and NBC Desktop Video are all still feeling their way, technologically. So far, only NBC gives customers access to any sort of archive.
 A "server" computer furnished by NBC at each site can store all the items broadcast in the most recent two weeks. Because the capacity of most corporate computer networks is already overextended, however, subscribers do not see full-motion video when they search this archive. Instead, they are able only to listen to the stories, which are accompanied by still pictures.
That same limited story-and-picture feature has been available for more than a year, along with some of the text-based news articles distributed by Bloomberg Financial Markets, the fast-growing data and news company that provides a wide variety of information services to the financial community.
Bloomberg is spending $250 million to upgrade all 48,000 of its subscribers' specially designed Bloomberg computer terminals to receive Bloomberg Information Television, a satellite-delivered video news channel that started 10 months ago and is vying to win over viewers of CNN and CNBC.
Michael Bloomberg, founder and chief executive of the company, contends that the costs of video production favor his company's general-news approach to the financial world, with conventional text-based services still being the most efficient way to cover events of interest to a relatively narrow audience.
Given the expense of fielding camera crews, "the economics are such that you can't afford to do many stories," Mr. Bloomberg said. As a result, he predicts, the narrow-focus news-gathering operations like Dow Jones and NBC will end up sending their cameras where they know there will be news -- the very events already being widely covered, he added.
But NBC and Dow Jones insist that they feature exclusive programming that their subscribers cannot get elsewhere. NBC said it had more than 270 exclusive interviews in the last month -- although some of these, like the first interview in the United States with the visiting President of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, may have had scant market-moving impact.
Still, when there is news being made, customers say they like the fact that they can view speeches and events themselves, without having to depend on journalists' interpretations.
Referring to "luminaries" like Mr. Greenspan, Glenn Havlicek, a managing director in the domestic treasury division of Chemical Bank, said: "As financial luminaries become more like movie stars, we are getting more and more sound bites. A lot of it is out of context, so when we can see it ourselves it gives us a fuller and fairer view of what someone had to say." Chemical Bank is trying out the services of both Reuters and NBC.
 Moreover, money managers at firms outside big cities say the services can save them time and money. "We're a small organization," said Paul Secord, equity portfolio manager at Independent Capital Management in Horsham, Pa., an hour outside Philadelphia.
"We don't have the luxury of having people to cover every investment conference," said Mr. Secord, who subscribes to PFN/First Call, an NBC desktop service that concentrates on live and taped coverage of industry conferences, exclusive interviews with chief executives and company announcements.
But as much as they say they like the new services, few customers who were interviewed were able to cite specific examples of how any of these had played a significant role in a decision to buy or sell.
And while Charles Schwab & Company, the San Francisco-based discount brokerage firm, is considering outfitting 350 of its top brokers with NBC Professional, so they will be on top of the news when their clients call, executives at other investment companies see the services as a potential distraction.
At Legg Mason Inc., a regional brokerage firm in Baltimore, the Dow Jones video service is available on only three computers in the firm's research department. "I think there would be a natural reluctance from management to put the service on each broker's desk," said Richard Cripps, Legg Mason's director of equity marketing. "They want them on the phone. They don't want them watching TV."

Chart: "Coming Soon to a Desktop Near Yours"
 Bringing live video to the desktop is the latest rage among media companies. The five services currently available take distinctive approaches.
 Reuters Financial Television concentrates on foreign exchange trading, closely following the movements of finance ministers and central bankers in 13 countries, mostly in Europe.
The Dow Jones Information Network and NBC's PFN/First Call focus more on industry conferences, exclusive interviews with chief executives and company announcements. A second NBC service, called NBC Professional, mostly covers breaking news.
NBC is also offering access to an archive containing all the stories broadcast by its two services in the previous two weeks. The stories are stored on a computer that "serves" them to each desktop computer on command. But because the capacity of most corporate computer networks is already stretched thin, subscribers do not see full-motion video. Instead, they are only able to listen to the stories, which are accompanied by a still image.
Bloomberg terminals are already equipped with a similar function, and later this year Dow Jones is planning to introduce an interactive service that will incorporate its TV service. Reuters is still in the development stage. LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN

HEADLINE: Menem's Victory in Argentina Seen as Endorsement of Free Market

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, May 15

 BODY:
The overwhelming victory of President Carlos Saul Menem in elections on Sunday was seen today as an endorsement of the free-market reforms that have slowed inflation andled to economic growth in Argentina. But it raised questions about the balance of power in this young democracy.
Most of the reaction to Mr. Menem's re-election was positive, particularly among economists, investors and foreign diplomats. Many saw his substantial margin of victory as a ringing endorsement for his economic agenda, which has been to restructure Argentina's economy through privatization and an ironclad currency exchange system that links the peso to the dollar. 
 With more than 90 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Menem, a Peronist, was elected to four more years in office with 49.7 percent of the vote, compared with 29.5 percent for Senator Jose Bordon of the center-left Frepaso coalition, the national election service announced today. Mr. Menem needed at least 45 percent to avoid a runoff.
The century-old Radical Party, which had been the Peronists' main rival until a recent surge of support for Mr. Bordon's coalition, had its worst showing ever, at 17 percent.
Some political analysts expressed concern that Mr. Menem's victory, and his party's victory in both houses of Congress, might give the Peronists too much power in a country that returned to democracy only 12 years ago after a brutal military dictatorship. But others said that the strong showing by Mr. Bordon's coalition, which was formed several months ago by defectors from the Peronists, was a growing counterbalance to Mr. Menem's power.
Mr. Bordon, who won a majority of the votes in Buenos Aires, the capital, is widely expected to be a viable contender for the 1999 presidential elections.
A number of brokers and bankers said that based on their conversations with large and small investors, local and foreign, Mr. Menem's re-election had increased their confidence in Argentina and was likely to bring a return of the foreign capital that fled the country after the Mexican peso's devaluation in December.
"There was a big collective sigh of relief by Argentines and foreign businessmen that there will be a continuity of the economic policies," said the United States Ambassador, James Cheek. "The businessmen have to be really pleased with this outcome, even though everybody acknowledges that the country still has to come through the crisis of confidence."
Larry Goodman, an economist for Salomon Brothers, a New York investment bank, said that Argentina's economic indicators remained strong and that with the return of foreign investment, the economy should increase at about 3 percent this year, although many economists and analysts had earlier predicted zero growth.
The victory of Mr. Menem's Peronist party in Congress appeared to give him a legislative mandate to continue his reforms. The Peronists gained a majority of seats in the Chamber of Deputies, where they had been a few votes short of a majority, and maintained their leadership in the upper house.
But some political analysts also expressed concern about the one-party control. Throughout his first term, Mr. Menem was criticized for his control of the judiciary, through his appointment of judges, and of his influence with the Congress.
"This drive toward supremacy by Menem is detrimental in a modern democracy because it weakens the system of parties, as it places men above institutions," said Natalio Botana, a political scientist at the Di Tella Institute.
The showing by Mr. Bordon's coalition was considered an encouraging sign, though. The coalition, which is composed of disaffected Peronists, Socialists and Christian Democrats, ran on a platform that promised to halt corruption, which was widespread in Mr. Menem's administration, and to create jobs in the face of unemployment of 12.2 percent.
"The people liked Menem's policies and Bordon's style of governance, but unfortunately they could only vote for one," said Felipe Noguera, a political analyst for Mora y Araujo, Noguera and Associates, a polling concern.
"But Bordon has been elected in some sense, although not to any real post -- but to speak out on the things that he stood for in the campaign."

HEADLINE: The Religious Right Readies Agenda for Second 100 Days

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
For months, religious conservatives watched, and many applauded, as the new Republican majority in Congress wielded its political muscle against Government spending. Now, they are urging those same Republicans to take up moral issues as well and push for restricting access to abortion, reducing Federal influence in education and, most important, creating a Constitutional protection for student-led school prayer.
"It's not that we're showing up, saying, 'O.K., guys, it's our turn,' " said the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition, an organization based in Anaheim, Calif., that says it represents 31,000 churches nationwide. After all, he said, the organization has supported spending cuts on the ground that national financial and spiritual stability are linked. 
 But in the second 100 days, Mr. Sheldon said, he expects to see moral issues on Congress's agenda. "There's a lot of social legislation we're going to work on and support, but our main thrust is going to be the Religious Equality Amendment," he said.
Indeed, some form of constitutional protection for student-led school prayer seems to be at or near the top of just about every agenda among religious conservatives.
The call for such an amendment will be featured in the Contract With the American Family that the Christian Coalition is scheduled to unveil at a news conference on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. The 10-point document will also call for turning over much of the Department of Education's budget to local schools, imposing new restrictions on abortion and making Federal prisoners pay restitution to victims of their crimes, said Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, the nation's largest group of religious conservatives, with 1.5 million members.
The news conference will start a new phase in the Republican-led Congress, one that some analysts say is fraught with peril for the Republican Party. The relative harmony of the first 100 days reflected, in part, the understanding that the more divisive social issues, like abortion and prayer in schools, would be deferred. Now, with that cease-fire over, conservative Christians are eager to move forward.
But the Republican Party has a painful history on this agenda. Abortion has long divided the party between conservative Christians and less ideological members; the issue has bubbled up in state races and in struggles over the party's platform, which since the Reagan ascendancy has called for a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion.
Moreover, the 1992 party convention, with explicit appeals to traditional values, was considered by many analysts to have backfired. A speech by the conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan, declaring that a "religious and cultural war" had begun, was widely denounced as polarizing and counterproductive to a party whose electoral fortunes depend on casting a wide net.
Already, the backlash to this newest offensive by conservative Christians has begun.
An alliance of some 50 religious, civil liberties and educational organizations has denounced the proposed Religious Equality Amendment as a breach of the principle of separation of church and state. The Coalition to Preserve Religious Liberty, as the alliance is called, is lobbying Congress and trying to rally popular opposition to the proposal, said its co-chairman, J. Brent Walker, who is also general counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs.
The American Civil Liberties Union today sent a letter to President Clinton, Congress and the 50 governors in which it called the Christian Coalition's plans an assault on constitutional freedoms.
"Religious expression in public schools is already protected by the First Amendment," said Ira Glasser, executive director of the A.C.L.U. "The Christian Coalition's real agenda is to impose its own religious beliefs and ceremonies on all students."
The Contract With the American Family follows in title and form the House Republicans' Contract With America, the political manifesto introduced in the election campaign last fall and taken up by the new Congress, and which the Christian Coalition supported.
"The economic and the cultural issues are a seamless web," Mr. Reed said. "And part of our broad agenda of limiting government is to turn power back to parents and families and local schools."
If the coalition stands in a position to make such recommendations, it is because religious conservatives claim credit for helping transform Congress in a conservative Republican direction. "In November, evangelicals turned out in record numbers," said James Dobson, president of Focus on the Family, a conservative Christian organization with a daily nationwide radio broadcast on social issues.
An exit poll survey conducted by Mitofsky International of 5,200 voters in that election found that just over 20 percent of voters identified themselves as Protestants who were evangelicals or born-again Christians. And 3 out of 4 of those Protestants reported voting for Republicans, said John Green, a political science professor at the University of Akron and director of its Ray Bliss Institute, a research center.
"It was the largest single voting bloc among Republican voters," said Professor Green, an expert on voting patterns among religious groups. "It represents just about a third of the Republican vote."
With this political potency in mind, religious conservatives have watched Republican decisions with a keen and critical eye. Dr. Dobson said he had been disturbed when Republican leaders chose Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey to deliver the party's response to President Clinton's State of the Union Message in January. Given her support of abortion rights, he said, Governor Whitman represented the "antithesis" of what religious conservatives value.
But Dr. Dobson said he had since met with Speaker Newt Gingrich and come away with assurances that Congress would soon begin to address moral concerns. "He did say that by the end of the second 100 days, we'd be more pleased with the outcome in respect to family values than we have been in the past," Dr. Dobson said.
As Speaker, Mr. Gingrich has not specifically endorsed a school prayer amendment. Rather, he has spoken in general terms about "religious freedom" legislation that would "create a legal framework that allows us to recognize that this is a profoundly religious country, but there is no state church."
A widely circulated version of the Religious Equality Amendment would bar Federal and state authorities from preventing anyone from engaging in "prayer or other religious expression" in situations, like graduation ceremonies, where "expression of a nonreligious character" would be allowed.
That wording represents a break with how religious conservatives approached school prayer in the past. Absent is any mention of teacher-led classroom prayer, which was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court 33 years ago.
Instead, the emphasis is on public expression of religious belief. The amendment would forbid the authorities to cite constitutional grounds to block "ceremonial" expression of religion, a clause that could allow Christmas creches on courthouse lawns.
The Christian Coalition, Mr. Reed said, wants the measure to guarantee "student-initiated" prayer, allowing students, for example, to bring in a minister, priest or rabbi for an invocation at graduation.
Lawyers with the American Center for Law and Justice, an organization founded in 1991 by Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster and founder of the Christian Coalition, have played a major role in drafting the amendment. Jay Sekulow, the center's general counsel, said the measure "gives those who have been concerned about morality in schools and the role of religion in public life a reason to hope that they will not be isolated or marginalized."
But Mr. Walker of the Coalition to Preserve Religious Liberty said the amendment "involves a drastic reordering of church and state."
He recently wrote a memorandum warning, for example, that the amendment could allow a public school teacher to "evangelize kindergarten students," a minister to preach "a hell-fire sermon" at a graduation ceremony or the Government "to fund religious schools in the same way it funds other, nonreligious schools."
Religious conservatives assert that the measure is popular with their constituencies, many of whom believe that an aggressive secularism in courts and city halls threatens to undercut religious liberties. They cite startling stories -- a pupil reprimanded for saying grace or for wanting to write about Jesus in a classroom essay -- as evidence that the religious are being shoved to the margins of society.
The proposed amendment, Dr. Dobson said, would "put it specifically in the Constitution that children and adults have a right to express their faith."
By casting the proposed amendment as a religious liberty measure, religious conservatives think they have a legislative winner.
But the measure is not their only hope. Mr. Sheldon, for example, said the Traditional Values Coalition was working with the office of Representative Philip M. Crane, Republican of Illinois, for a "clarification" of what Federal tax laws say about how much time, money and labor that religious groups can spend on influencing legislation.
His group, Mr. Sheldon said, wants to see the limit for time, money and labor set at 19 percent. Currently, there is no specified limit other than it should be "insignificant," he said. "Churches across America would like to be more active in the influencing of public policy and that's what this would do," he said.
And in its Contract With the American Family, the Christian Coalition expects to call for new regulations on abortion, like limiting late-term abortions, Mr. Reed said.
Some action against abortion is vital to religious conservatives, Mr. Sekulow said, adding, "To ignore the life issue is to ignore the ongoing culture clash in our society."

HEADLINE: Tomb of Ramses II's Many Sons Is Found in Egypt

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
Ramses II, one of ancient Egypt's greatest pharaohs, is said to have fathered more than 100 children, including 52 sons. Archeologists have now discovered an enormous mausoleum with at least 67 chambers, the largest tomb ever explored in the Valley of the Kings, and they think this was the resting place for most of those royal sons.
Working their way through a narrow entrance in the limestone hillside, archeologists were astonished to find a central hall with 16 pillars, a passageway to a statue of the god Osiris and other corridors leading away to many separate chambers. In the dim light they could glimpse wall decorations and alabaster fragments carrying inscriptions with the names of four sons of Ramses, and sarcophagus pieces, mummy fragments and statuary strongly suggesting that the tomb was used for their burials. 
 The sons never attained the power of their father, whose reign lasted 66 years, and their elaborate burial place is not likely to yield treasures similar to those in the tomb of Tutankhamen, the young King Tut. But the newly explored tomb, archeologists said, promised invaluable insights into Egypt's royal family at a crucial period in ancient history.
The discovery was described yesterday by Dr. Kent R. Weeks, a professor of Egyptology at the American University in Cairo who directs a project to map the monuments at the ancient Egyptian capital of Thebes, 300 miles south of Cairo. The tomb is part of the necropolis, known as the Valley of the Kings, where monarchs and nobles were buried from 1600 B.C. to 1000 B.C. The site is on the west side of the Nile, across from the ruins of Karnak and Luxor.
"It's like no other tomb I know of anywhere in Egypt," Dr. Weeks said in a telephone interview.
Most ancient Egyptian tombs consist of only a few chambers, and these are small and laid out along a single axis. Tomb 5, as the new find is designated, not only has at least 67 chambers arrayed in a complex plan, but stairs and sloping corridors -- yet to be explored -- apparently lead to even more rooms on a lower level. These lower rooms may be the actual burial chambers, Dr. Weeks said, and the total number of chambers could be more than 100.
Dr. Peter Dorman, an archeologist from the University of Chicago who works across the river at Luxor and has visited the site, praised the discovery as "a very significant find, very impressive and certain to give us a much clearer picture of the family of Ramses II." He also noted that the tomb's architecture was "completely unlike any other tomb" in Egypt.
Dr. David O'Connor, an Egyptologist at the University of Pennsylvania's University Museum, said the grandeur of the tomb complex "seems to say something important about the status of royal princes during the Ramses reign." Princes usually rated much more modest burial places.
Dr. Weeks wondered if there could be other multiple burials for the families of other pharaohs that have gone undetected.
"Tomb 5 raises many questions about what else the Valley of the Kings and other areas at Thebes may have to offer," Dr. Weeks said in a statement issued by the American University of Cairo. "It is an entirely new type of New Kingdom burial structure."
Egypt and a large part of the known world in the 13th century B.C. were dominated by the long reign of Ramses II. He was one of the most powerful rulers in antiquity and a prolific builder of monumental architecture. His empire extended from Libya east to the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, from Turkey south to the Sudan. His charioteers fought many battles against the Hittites, arch-enemies in what is now Turkey and Syria. Tradition has it that Ramses was pharaoh at the time of the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt.
According to the Book of Exodus, the first son of the pharaoh was killed by God. In Chapter 11, Verse 5, it says, "And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant." The eldest son of Ramses II was named Amon-her-khepeshef. He is one of the sons whose names are inscribed on the walls of Tomb 5.
The tomb occupies a prominent place in the necropolis, 100 feet from the tomb of Ramses II himself and not far from King Tut's. In fact, when the English archeologist Howard Carter excavated Tut's tomb, he unknowingly piled dirt and debris over Tomb 5's entrance, further obscuring it.
That entrance was discovered once in 1820 by an English traveler, but he explored no farther than the three outermost chambers, which were unprepossessing and damaged by floodwaters. In the 1980's, Dr. Weeks and other archeologists rediscovered the hidden entrance by studying the diaries of the 19th century travelers. They also followed the lead of an ancient papyrus now in a museum in Turin, Italy. It described the trial of a thief in 1150 B.C. who was caught trying to rob the tomb of Ramses II and also one "across the path," presumably the one now called Tomb 5.
Cutting test trenches on the slopes near the Ramses tomb, they uncovered the narrow entrance and did some preliminary investigation. But debris washed in by floods hampered exploration. Only in February were Dr. Weeks and his team able to remove debris blocking the door leading off the grand hall with 16 pillars.
Once through the door, they found less water damage and one surprise after another. They followed the passageway leading past 20 doors of smaller chambers and ending at the statue of Osiris, god of the underworld. Two branching corridors each had 20 doors to other rooms. The smallest rooms were about 10 by 10 feet; the largest was 60 by 60 feet.
This was when Dr. Weeks realized he had entered, as he said, "the largest tomb in the Valley of the Kings and maybe the largest ever found in all Egypt." It was certainly more complex and extensive than the standard royal tombs, which are simple structures with a single corridor leading to a main burial chamber.
In an interview with the Reuters news agency in Cairo, Abdelhalim Nourredin, head of Egypt's Supreme Council for Antiquities, described the structure and the many chambers as magnificent, even if some of the rooms were badly damaged by water, and important because of its "unique design and size from a crucial period in ancient history." The Egyptian Government worked with Dr. Weeks in the explorations.
Dr. Weeks speculated that the rooms on this main level were used for religious ceremonies and making offerings to the dead, with the lower rooms set aside for the burials.
The floors were littered with thousands of pieces of pottery, statue fragments, jewelry and beads, pieces of wooden furniture, stone sarcophagus fragments, inscribed stone vessels, bones from offerings of cooked meat and pieces of mummified human bodies. Dr. Weeks said there was no indication that looters had ever penetrated the back chambers, or been anywhere in the tomb since antiquity.
Close examination revealed the inscribed names of four sons of Ramses. Decorations in the small entrance rooms included the names of Amon-her-khepeshef, the firstborn, and the second son whose name was, in effect, Ramses Junior. A piece of alabaster jar bore the name and titles of another son, Sety, and outside the entrance archeologists found a piece of limestone on which was written the name of Mery-amon, the 15th son.
Historians know the names of all 52 sons, but little else about them. They had previously been able to identify the burial sites of only two of Ramses' sons. Mernepteh, the 13th son, succeeded his father as pharaoh and so built his own tomb in the Valley of the Kings. The fifth son, Khaemwase, is thought to be buried at Saqqara, south of the Pyramids of Giza.
It is entirely possible, Dr. Weeks and other archeologists said, that all 50 of Ramses' other sons were laid to rest in Tomb 5. Explorations are scheduled to be resumed in July.

HEADLINE: Tobacco Suit's Plaintiffs Suffer A Court Setback

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
In a setback for plaintiffs in a giant class-action suit against American tobacco companies, a Federal district judge in New Orleans agreed to allow his class-action certification of the case to be taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
An appeal, which could take six months to a year, would have the effect of stopping the momentum of a consortium of lawyers from close to 60 plaintiffs' law firms who have gathered in New Orleans to mount the largest class-action suit in history. The plaintiffs contend that the seven companies, their related units and the Tobacco Institute, an industry group, had concealed knowledge that nicotine was addictive and had manipulated nicotine levels in cigarettes to keep customers addicted. 
 In his order yesterday, the judge, Okla B. Jones 2d, stayed all trial action in the case, halting the plaintiffs' discovery procedure, in which the consortium had hoped to find documents incriminating to the tobacco companies.
Also halted is the largest notification effort ever initiated in a court of law, a plan to use newspaper, magazine and television advertisements to inform as many as 90 million smokers and former smokers that they may be included in the class action.
Although the judge's order made an appeal possible, only the Fifth Circuit, which is in New Orleans, can decide whether to take the case. However, analysts and lawyers for both sides said an appeal was highly likely, given the magnitude of the case.
The order "is definitely a temporary victory for the tobacco companies," said Prof. Kenneth Abraham, a specialist in insurance and tort law at the University of Virginia. "It gives the companies an opportunity to get the class decertified, and to possibly save some of the enormous resources that they would have had to invest in this trial."
The plaintiffs' lawyers acknowledged that they felt "a little disappointment that we can't move ahead rapidly," said John P. Coale, one of the lawyers, who is also their spokesman. "The tobacco companies will buy some time with this, but that's all they'll buy," he said, adding, "We hope we'll win on appeal because we tightly followed Fifth Circuit law."
But some analysts speculated that the ruling, and the resulting delay, would cause disarray in the plaintiffs' camp. "I wonder if the coalition of law firms can stay together," said Gary Black, a tobacco analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
Mr. Coale said the plaintiffs were "in this for the duration," adding that "the good news is that Judge Jones's order keeps us from going on for years and spending trillions of dollars on the case, and then having the court of appeals say we shouldn't have got certification."
Charles Wall, senior vice president and associate general counsel at the Philip Morris Companies, applauded the judge's decision and denied that the tobacco companies were using delaying tactics. "We had the right to appeal an adverse decision, and I feel that our chances of prevailing in the appeal are very good because we're right -- on the law," he said.
Daniel W. Donahue, senior vice president and deputy general counsel for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a unit of RJR Nabisco, said he thought it was "likely that the Fifth Circuit will in fact review this case on the merits," because it contains "novel, untested and previously unapplied legal theories," he added.
The plaintiffs' lawsuit was filed in March 1994 in the United States Eastern District of Louisiana on behalf of Dianne Castano, who is the widow of a smoker, and three other plaintiffs.
In yesterday's order, Judge Jones wrote that "the system of law is not designed to have one court control the economies and lives of so many in a case of such legal importance." He added that though he had "a firm belief of having made the right decision in certifying this matter as a limited class action," he agreed to the tobacco companies' request for an appeal.
Wall Street has followed the case closely for its potential to cost the tobacco companies billions in liability damages. Word of the judge's order began circulating about a half-hour before the close of the New York Stock Exchange, "but it's hard to say that it moved the tobacco stocks," said Emanuel Goldman, a securities analyst for Paine Webber. "It should have a somewhat positive effect in the future."
Shares of Philip Morris climbed 62.5 cents, to $70.875, while shares of the Loews Corporation, parent of Lorillard Inc., were up $1.50, to $115.375.
In his order, Judge Jones mentioned a March decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago, which reversed a lower-court decision permitting a class action by 10,000 hemophilia patients -- or their surviving families -- who had been infected by H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. They were suing five international drug companies that had supplied the patients with blood-clotting medicine, asserting that the companies knowingly distributed clotting products contaminated with H.I.V.
At the time of that decision, the tobacco companies said it provided a precedent to invalidate the legal assault brought by the plaintiffs' lawyers. But the plaintiffs' lawyers said that the issues were substantially different and that the ruling, by a three-judge appeals panel, was an aberration.
The companies named in the tobacco suit are the American Tobacco Company, a unit of American Brands; the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company; the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, a unit of B.A.T. Industries P.L.C.; Philip Morris Inc.; Liggett & Myers Inc., a unit of Brooke Group Ltd.; the Lorillard Tobacco Company; and the United States Tobacco Company, a unit of UST Inc.

HEADLINE: Iranian Leader Says U.S. Move on Oil Deal Wrecked Chance to Improve Ties

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, May 15

 BODY:
President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran tried to appeal directly to the American people today, asserting that the United States missed a chance to improve relations when it forced the cancellation in March of a $1 billion deal Teheran had made with an American oil company, and urging Washington to lift its recent trade embargo against his country.
But the Iranian leader also exhibited his long-held antipathy to the United States. In a 75-minute interview with ABC News, he said the Clinton Administration owed Iran "a thousand apologies" for what he called efforts to weaken the 16-year-old revolutionary Government with "lies" and "bullying." He repeatedly asserted that Washington owes Iran billions of dollars from the time of the Shah. 
 Mr. Rafsanjani, who has virtually no contact with the Americans and seldom grants interviews to American news organizations, was unable to hide his curiosity about American policy. He more than once asked Peter Jennings, the ABC anchor who interviewed him, whether the Clinton Administration's characterization of his country as an outlaw state spreading global terror and desperately seeking nuclear weapons was justified.
"We invited an American firm and entered into a deal for $1 billion," Mr. Rafsanjani said of the agreement with a Dutch subsidiary of Conoco, the Houston-based oil company, to develop two off-shore oil fields. "This was a message to the United States, which was not correctly understood. We had a lot of difficulty in this country by inviting an American company to come here with such a project because of public opinion."
The Conoco deal would have represented the first major American investment in Iran since the 1979 revolution and therefore would have sent an important signal to other investors at a time of huge inflation, an increase of capital flight and a lack of investor confidence among both Iranians and foreigners.
The Clinton Administration's cancellation of the deal and the trade ban that followed this month has contributed to a quiet panic on the streets of Teheran and a sense that things can only get worse.
The embargo itself will have only a minimal effect on Iran's economy. The United States sold Iran only $330 million worth of goods last year, the most important of which were for equipment for the country's aging oil fields. American oil companies bought upwards of $3.5 billion of Iran's oil last year.
The official reaction in Teheran to the American trade ban is that it does not aggravate Iran's economic problems and enjoys no support from Iran's other trading partners.
But even Mr. Rafsanjani acknowledged today that it would have a psychological effect. "This provocation could provide some anxiety," he said, although he added, "In practice it would not have much effect."
But Mr. Rafsanjani urged the United States to rethink its policy. "My suggestion to your Government is not to do these immature things it's doing," he said, adding, "We are not asking the United States to have relations with us. What we are asking the United States is to stop its hostility against us."
The dollar may not get much respect in Tokyo or Bonn, but in Teheran, it is the only currency that counts. Even before President Clinton's executive order banning trade with Iran, the country's national currency was in steady decline.
But in the last week, the rial plunged to its lowest level against the dollar since the Iranian revolution, sparking widespread buying of dollars on the black market and much-publicized arrests of money changers from their informal headquarters on a strip near the Central Bank in central Teheran. Mr. Rafsanjani, who had once tried to allow the Iranian rial to rise and fall freely on the open market, threatened executions of the "economic terrorists."
Curiously, independent, but more established money changers are still allowed to change dollars, and customers lined up today outside the shops in central Teheran to change dollars at more than twice the official rate.
Even as Mr. Rafsanjani said the American embargo would have no practical effect, he blamed the United States and Israel for wreaking havoc on Iran's currency.
Mr. Rafsanjani said of the independent money changers: "We gave them too much of a free hand. They have acted in full harmony and synchronized their actions with the trade ban of the United States and the actions of the Israelis."
Mr. Rafsanjani also repeated denials that Iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon.

HEADLINE: MEDICARE TARGET COULD BE ELUSIVE, MANY EXPERTS SAY

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
As Congress rolls toward a vote this week on more than $250 billion in Medicare savings, a variety of health policy experts say there is no magic formula for extracting that much money from the program by 2002, the Republicans' self-imposed deadline for balancing the Federal budget.
Slowing spending that much in that short a time almost certainly would mean charging beneficiaries more while squeezing payments to hospitals and other health care providers, these experts say. 
 "There's no way to do this without imposing real sacrifice and real pain," said Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, "and both beneficiaries and providers will feel it. The notion that this can be squeezed out of the system with greater efficiencies is wishful thinking."
So far, the debate on Capitol Hill has been stuck on generalities and sound bites. From Sunday talk shows to weekday committee rooms, Republican leaders have maintained that they can wring that money from the system while "preserving, protecting and improving" Medicare, which serves 37 million elderly or disabled Americans. They have talked about "new technologies, new management and new approaches."
Many health policy analysts agree that over the long haul, a basic restructuring of Medicare to encourage greater use of managed care may produce some of the painless savings the Republicans promise.
Moreover, few experts dismiss the idea that the Federal Government ought to try to get control of the upward spiral of Medicare expenditures in areas like home health care. There is also considerable support for charging affluent beneficiaries more of the true cost of Medicare benefits. There have been proposals from both Democrats and Republicans over the years, for example, that would require upper-income elderly to pay higher premiums for the insurance that covers doctors' fees, which is now heavily subsidized by general tax revenue.
But the sheer amount that the Republicans seek to save in Medicare means they will have to go well beyond such narrowly targeted proposals, many experts say.
And as is often the case with health policy, the decisions made on Medicare could ripple through the health care system with far-reaching and unintended consequences. For example, many planners say that new spending controls could be particularly hard on rural and inner city hospitals, which often serve a disproportionate share of elderly and low-income patients.
The Medicare revisions will also come at a time of immense change in the private health care marketplace, where employers are being more aggressive in their efforts to control costs. Many hospitals, some policy analysts say, could be caught in a vise, squeezed on one side by Medicare and the Medicaid program for the poor, and on the other side by private payers.
Gail R. Wilensky, a health policy expert in the Bush Administration and a longtime advocate of many of the Republican proposals, acknowledged that hospitals are in for a tumultuous time.
"You'll have pressure to find different ways of providing services, and some of the providers will probably not survive the pressure coming from the private and public sectors," Ms. Wilensky said. Such a shakeout, she added, happens from time to time. "It happened in defense, it happened in corporate America, but nobody expected it to happen in health care," she said.
Republicans assert, of course, that reining in spending is essential to ease the strain on the Medicare trust fund as well as to balance the budget by 2002. They bitterly dispute the notion that their proposals, reported out by the House and Senate Budget Committees last week, even qualify as cuts. Overall spending on the program, which cost $162 billion in the 1994 fiscal year, would still rise, they note, just not as fast as projected. The Senate proposal says it would reduce the growth rate from about 10 percent a year to about 7.1 percent a year; the House version would peg it at about 5.4 percent a year.
But Bruce C. Vladeck, administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare, scoffs at the idea that spending reductions of that magnitude are necessary to save the trust fund. "It's necessary to save some political rear ends, but it's not necessary to save the trust fund," he said.
And representatives of the hospital industry and the elderly portray the Republican proposals as out and out cuts that would do everything but "preserve, protect and improve" the 30-year-old insurance program. They note that Medicare spending grows not only because of medical inflation, but also because of increases in the size of the beneficiary population and increases in the services being provided.
The Republican proposals, they argue, would simply shift more costs to the elderly, to health care providers and, eventually, to other health care consumers, concerns also cited by Democrats. Vice President Al Gore, in an interview today, argued, "It is wrong to pretend for the purposes of a political shell game that this phenomenon doesn't occur; it does occur."
The Catholic Health Association, representing nearly 900 hospitals and institutions offering long-term care, has described the Republican budget targets as "unprecedented and devastating." Dick Davidson, president of the American Hospital Association, used a similar characterization in a letter last week to Republican leaders.
"Do these spending reductions avert the trust fund's insolvency?" he wrote. "No, only postpone it. Meanwhile, will access to and quality of medical care for seniors deteriorate? Without question."
The debate has an edge of the surreal because, so far, it is largely over a number, not a detailed set of policies. The Senate's proposal sets a $256 billion target for seven-year savings and calls for a bipartisan commission to figure out how to get there. The House calls for $282 billion in savings, and a Budget Committee working group outlines assorted options to achieve it, including new charges for beneficiaries and controls on payments to providers. But the House plan leaves the details to other committees.
"As was the case with health care reform, one needs to look at the details before one can make an assessment that this is a disaster or a complicated and difficult program that could work," said Stuart Altman, a health policy expert at Brandeis University and a member of a Medicare advisory board. "I would like to know how we would get there before I would vote on the dollars."
Still, the votes will certainly be cast this week in the House, with debate beginning in the Senate. And once these votes are cast and the resolutions approved, Republicans will inevitably have to look in a few basic spots for the money to carry them out.
Down the road, they hope to achieve big savings by injecting more competition and cost-consciousness into the Medicare system, by such mechanisms as giving the elderly vouchers that they could use to buy their own coverage. But in the meantime, experts predict and the House working group's proposal clearly suggests, lawmakers will look to higher premiums, deductibles and co-payments for beneficiaries, and for ways to tighten payments to providers.
The premium paid by the elderly for the insurance that covers doctor and outpatient services, known as Medicare Part B, is now $46.10 a month. Conservatives say that when Medicare was created, the intent was that beneficiaries would pay a premium covering half of the program cost; now, they pay about 25 percent. Both houses are almost certain to raise that monthly premium -- the House plan suggests an increase of $5 to $7 each year -- as well as the deductible for the Part B program, which now stands at $100 a year.
One of the House options would also charge new Medicare beneficiaries an additional $20 a month for Part B insurance, beginning in 1999, if they want to have traditional fee-for-service coverage instead of joining a health maintenance organization. That would be a way of speeding the movement of Medicare beneficiaries into managed care, promoting more savings in the long run.
New co-payments are also likely, particularly a 20 percent co-payment for users of home health care services. That may turn out to be one of the most controversial of the Medicare proposals, because many advocates and planners say such a co-payment would fall on the sickest and oldest of Americans. The American Association of Retired Persons says the co-payment would be a "sick tax" that would cost the average home health care user an additional $900 in 1996.
Advocates of the co-payment note that home health care costs have been soaring and argue that the payment could help "discourage over-utilization," as one House Budget Committee document put it. Low-income elderly people could be cushioned from the charge, they add.
But advocates for the elderly maintain that out-of-pocket costs for health care are already a burden on Medicare beneficiaries. The American Association of Retired Persons said last week that Republican budget committee proposals could mean more than $3,000 in additional out-of-pocket expenses for the average beneficiary over the next seven years.
There are any number of ways to restrict payments to providers, with any number of potential consequences, ranging from negligible to wrenching, health planners say. Medicare is an integral part of the health care system, not only reimbursing hospitals and doctors directly for care, but also helping to subsidize medical education, for example. The proposals from the House Budget Committee's working group suggest cuts in many of these areas.
There have been other efforts to control spending in the past, but what makes this round different is the squeeze already under way from employers, several analysts say. Those who view the health care system as a whole wonder what the impending changes might mean for the uninsured.
"You have a shrinking of all the places where hospitals tried to cross-subsidize treating the uninsured and underinsured," said Diane Rowland, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a research group that focuses on health issues. "I wonder what's going to happen to our uncompensated care system and our 41 million uninsured if the fiscal situation at some of these hospitals gets dramatically worse."
As all these concerns are raised in the days to come, Republicans will return again and again to their core arguments: that Medicare must be reshaped to keep it solvent for those now growing old, and that the Federal budget must be balanced by 2002 for the sake of future generations.

Three Named to Microsoft's Top Management

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The Microsoft Corporation promoted three executives yesterday to its office of the president, a move that analysts viewed as a broadening of management control as the software developer moves into new businesses.
At Microsoft, the office of the president is the top-management group that works directly with William H. Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft, in charting the company's strategy. The office of the president, formerly a three-person forum, will now have five members. 
 Along with the executive promotions, Microsoft also announced a reorganization that folds its advanced-technology unit into a product group, suggesting that its research will be increasingly expected to contribute to profits. The advanced-technology group has worked on projects ranging from Microsoft Network, an on-line service scheduled to begin later this year, to an interactive television effort called Tiger, which is probably years away from the marketplace.
The three new members of the office of the president are Pete Higgins, formerly a senior vice president and head of the desktop applications division; Nathan Myhrvold, formerly a senior vice president who ran the advanced-technology group; and Paul Maritz, formerly senior vice president for products and technology. Each assumes the title of group vice president.
As reported yesterday, Mike Maples, a 52-year-old executive vice president and member of Microsoft's office of the president, plans to retire, effective July 15.
"The promotions are part of the broadening of control and power at Microsoft as the place gets bigger and the people get older," said David Coursey, editor of PC Letter, a newsletter in San Mateo, Calif.
The three group vice presidents will oversee all of Microsoft's product divisions, which are being placed into two new groups, called the platforms group and the applications and content group.
The platforms group, overseen by Mr. Maritz, who is 40, includes the Microsoft operating systems for consumers and business, from Windows to Windows NT. The development work on common objects for software, security and tools for future systems will be part of the platforms group. Some of the advanced-technology unit is being placed under Mr. Maritz's supervision.
Both Mr. Higgins, who is 37, and Mr. Myhrvold, who is 35, will be in charge of the applications and content group. Analysts say that Mr. Higgins is the marketing expert, while Mr. Myhrvold's strength is as a technologist. The group will supervise the desktop applications business, consumer software, the new on-line service, and research in fields like speech recognition.
Mr. Myhrvold dismissed suggestions that basic research was being downgraded as a result of the reorganization. Instead, he said, the changes reflect a recognition that many company projects are moving from being ideas to being products.

HEADLINE: Rangel's Voice: Stronger Than Ever;
Dean of Delegation Furious Over Cuts

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

 BODY:
Even at a recent memorial service for an old friend, held in a Harlem church just down the block from the house where he was born, Representative Charles B. Rangel used his turn at the pulpit to preach against "the silence of good people" while, as he sees it, the world is falling apart.
"Black folks are being hurt as we never have before," Mr. Rangel told the crowd gathered to remember a community leader, Arnold P. Johnson, and a few people said amen to that. "And I say there are so many white folks affected who don't even know it!" he went on, his voice cresting. "The same thing happened in Germany, where people thought this was happening to somebody else. But they will find out they're on the list, too." 
 Though outrage is an overused word on Capitol Hill, Mr. Rangel gives every indication of actually being mad as hell. It isn't only the Republican Contract With America that sets him off, though he says it is contrary to everything he believes in. He is also furious at many fellow Democrats, whom he describes as complacent during an all-out assault on the poor.
He repeatedly likens what he calls the current apathy to the attitude in Nazi Germany that led to the Holocaust. He assails everyone from President Clinton to John Cardinal O'Connor, admonishing that they should speak out more forcefully. He also says he fears that the country is on the brink of violent revolution.
Sometimes, he sounds surprisingly like a conservative talk-show host, until he gets to the part about his proposed solution, which is almost always education. He says Hispanic and black teen-agers are alone among God's creatures in having no sense of self-preservation and he calls drug dealers so dumb they have to eat in Burger Kings because they can't read a menu.
And in this, his 25th year in Congress, the dean of the New York delegation, who will be 65 next month, is now the No. 2 Democrat on a powerful House committee, Ways and Means, and seems to have abandoned even the modicum of restraint traditionally maintained by those in his position.
"I'm starting a new approach," he said. "I'm going to become a terrorist, too" -- an oratorical bomb-thrower with a doomsday message and the unhappy conviction that he is mostly going it alone these days.
His role as spokesman for the have-nots is not new, but Mr. Rangel, who normally uses wit to make a point, has turned up the volume considerably.
"I've seen, since the fall election, a different Charlie Rangel," said Barbara B. Kennelly, a Connecticut Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. "Now he's determined to let his life experience be known."
At the Democrats' recent retreat in Piney Point, Md., the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said of Mr. Rangel: "We were all focused on what to do about economic problems and the angry middle class, and he quickly brought everybody back to earth by reminding us that some people have stopped even trying to get into the middle class because there's no hope. People listened."
But Mr. Rangel dismissed the retreat "as just so much chitchat."
After three decades in public life, the portly, gravel-voiced Mr. Rangel, who is very much the Old World-style gentleman yet sprinkles his sentences with mild profanity, still takes politics personally. And he is acutely embarrassed, he said, to see the New Deal falling apart while he is on the job.
After a constituent greeted him outside his office and praised his recent performance in a television debate, he shook his head and said: "They think I'm winning. I can't tell them what I've told you. I can't say it all stopped on my watch."
A particular sore point is both the substance and the language of the welfare debate, in which people on aid have been likened to wolves and alligators. "I don't know what the hell people felt in Germany when they would say the Jews were responsible for every goddamn problem that Europe and Germany had, but there were a whole lot of people who agreed with them," he said. "And more than those that agreed was the goddamn silence of the moral leaders."
In referring to the Holocaust, he said, he did not intend to compare that singular horror to anything happening in Congress today. But he does intend, he said, to be as outrageous as necessary to pierce the silence.
A Roman Catholic himself, he is particularly critical of leaders in his own church, including Cardinal O'Connor, who along with Catholic bishops has criticized the proposed welfare overhaul and said it could encourage abortions. But that is not enough for Mr. Rangel.
"We are talking about feeding the hungry!" he said, loosening his tie and moving into an impassioned monologue in his New York office, on 125th Street, where the view from his window includes one of the nation's first public housing projects. The Cardinal, he said, "sent somebody to say he saw me on C-Span and how proud he was of how I was dealing with the question of welfare and he was preparing to make a political statement.
"I said, 'You turn right back and tell him I don't need any political statement. Tell him to put his vestments on and get on the Capitol steps and read Matthew,' " he said, referring to the Gospel reading in which Jesus says heaven belongs to those who feed the hungry, take in the strangers and visit the sick and those in prison. "What the hell do you need a political statement for when it's in the New Testament?"
His own experience, he said, illustrates the need for a more aggressive approach.
Born in Harlem in 1930, Charles Bernard Rangel barely knew the father who he says physically abused his mother, never held a job and left the family when Charles was 6.
His mother, Blanche Rangel, cleaned houses, worked as a home attendant and cut the threads off shoulder pads coming off a factory assembly line. When he was 8, he too went to work, in a neighborhood drug store, delivering prescriptions and pouring castor oil into small bottles from 5-gallon cans.
He always worked, but by the time he was in high school he was often truant and occasionally driven home by the police. At 16, he quit school to sell shoes, and drifted, he said, until he served in the Army during the Korean War, when he rescued 40 men from behind enemy lines and was decorated with the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star.
And after he returned home to banner headlines in The New York Amsterdam News, he went back to school and became a lawyer.
Mr. Rangel's rocky start, overcome with the government's help, has made him a broken record on the subject of funds for education and programs for those he calls "second chancers" like himself.
Yet he is no softy in speaking about personal responsibility. "I've always talked about the problem of irresponsible women having babies that will turn into urban terrorists," he said. "Sure, that's just what the Republicans picked up on and I don't deny that. But it's an indictment of the educational system."
And he describes drug dealers in the harshest terms: "These young entrepreneurs are so stupid that they can't even count their money with a money counter. They have no idea what to do with the money, I mean after they get their mother a big television set and they buy some stupid Jeep with a boom system in it and they get every girl there is to like some gold teeth and some chains. If you told them, 'Why don't you go to Europe?' it's, 'Which way is Europe?' "
His own role model, when he was a child who could have easily got into trouble, was his mother's father, a courthouse elevator operator who always wore his uniform and badge home and knew all the judges and big-shot lawyers.
One of Mr. Rangel's most emotional memories is returning home alone and sad after his New York University graduation, which he had very much wanted his grandfather to attend, and finding him in the kitchen, all dressed up and drunk. He had gone to the graduation, it turned out, but had been unable to find his grandson in the crowd, so he went home.
When his grandfather wanted to continue working at his Civil Service job past the mandatory retirement age of 70, the young Mr. Rangel stopped by the local political club to ask for help in the matter. Soon after that he got involved in politics himself, mostly, he said, because he had seen how puny the competition was.
In Congress, the fight against drug abuse has been his great passion; he has vehemently opposed those who favor legalization, and defended Nancy Reagan when others disparaged her 'Just Say No' campaign.
But the Congressman's wife, Alma Carter Rangel, a former social worker whom he says he loved at first sight, which was nearly 40 years ago on the dance floor of Harlem's Savoy Ballroom, said without hesitation that his chief motivation in life is ambition.
Some of those ambitions have lately been dashed, at least temporarily, during an exceptionally difficult period for Mr. Rangel, both personally and politically. After the last election, he lost his chairmanship of a key Ways and Means subcommittee.
Then, in March, Mr. Rangel's mother, with whom he had spoken several times a day every day, died at age 90. And now, he said, he often goes around feeling like he has forgotten to do something, then remembers that he would ordinarily have been checking in with her.
Mr. Rangel declined to speculate on his political future except to say that he does not look forward to retirement. He has no hobbies, he said, can't relax past the third day of any vacation and has been warned by his wife that he is going to wind up friendless in his old age because he tends to neglect personal relationships in favor of work.
"I feel alone a lot, so that's what has been a source of complaint on my part," Mrs. Rangel said. "But then again, he loves what he does."
And for now, her husband said, a big part of his job is annoying his fellow lawmakers.
When asked the standard question about his current role, he laughed and said: "To be a thorn in the side of people who say they're Democrats" but sound increasingly like Republicans. "If you're going down the tube, if you're going to lose, lose fighting."

HEADLINE: New California Laws Will Aid The Recovery of Orange County

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., May 15

 BODY:
Gov. Pete Wilson of California signed into law today five bills crucial to the recovery plan of Orange County, Calif. But he vetoed a sixth bill that would have authorized him to impose a trustee to manage the financial affairs of the brankrupt county.
Mr. Wilson, in his veto message, contended that Orange County should be left to manage its affairs on its own. 
 "Having the state intervene to this level in the day-to-day management of local government affairs is not warranted at this time," he wrote.
Separately, the county, which fell into backruptcy last year after its investment pool lost about $2 billion, won a commitment from MBIA Inc. to insure $275 million in recovery bonds to finance partial repayment to the local governments that participated in the pool.
The insurance backing of MBIA fills a crucial hole in the county's settlement agreement with the nearly 200 cities, school districts and agencies that invested $5.1 billion in the pool. Approved this month by United States Bankruptcy Judge John Ryan, the proposed settlement enables the county to fulfill its promise to pay most of the money lost by the participants.
The school districts will now get back 90 percent of their investments in cash, while the other participants in the pool will receive 80 percent. The balance will consist of claims against the county.
The five bills signed into law, approved last week by both houses of the California Legislature, are supposed to help the county refinance more than $1 billion of debt. It plans to issue new debt directly backed by state motor vehicle license fees, waste management revenue and Teeter Plan notes. They will also remove certain restrictions on sales of county property.
In vetoing the trusteeship bill, Mr. Wilson said he might support such a measure in the future. "If the board of supervisors fails to show the necessary leadership to continue to lead the county through these difficult times, this issue may need to be revisited," Mr. Wilson wrote.
The county has asked the holders of more than $1 billion of debt maturing this summer to wait an additional year for repayment. On June 27 county residents will vote on a ballot measure to increase the county's sales tax by half a percent, to 8.25 percent. The passage of the tax increase, which would raise about $130 million annually, is considered essential to the recovery plan.
"The county still has to pass Measure R in June," said William Popejoy, chief administrative officer of the county, "as well as identify other new revenue sources to satisfy the $2 billion in claims resulting from the financial crisis."
MBIA officials said concern about the consequences for the $1.3 trillion municipal market if many of the participants in the fund defaulted on their coming obligations played a role in the decision to insure the securities. "Our goal was to help the participants," said Neil Budnick, senior vice president at MBIA. "California is a very big market for us."
MBIA declined to say what it was charging to insure the bonds, but analysts estimated that the county would have to pay a significant premium on what other issuers usually paid for insurance.

HEADLINE: Major Stock Indexes Set Records as Bonds Continue to Rally

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stock traders, expecting no surprises in economic data due out today, bid up the major stock indexes to more record highs, as the bond market also continued its rally.
Many market analysts expect the Federal Reserve to do nothing about interest rates at its policy-setting meeting next Tuesday. "Fed watching is going to become pretty boring," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. 
 Beginning what stock analysts expect to be another record-breaking week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.91 points, to a record 4,437.47, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 2.19 points, to 527.74, also a record. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 4.12 points, to 863.06, still another all-time high.
Long-term interest rates also fell. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.94 percent from 6.99 percent.
But the dollar also fell against major currencies, but not by much, providing more evidence for the much-anticipated "bottom" for the dollar's steep decline this year. The dollar fell to 86.40 Japanese yen from 86.80 yen, while it fell to 1.4360 German mark from 1.4485.
At its lowest, on April 18, the dollar fell to less than 81 yen and less than 1.36 marks.
Today, the Government is scheduled to release reports on industrial production and factory use, as well as data on the housing industry, such as housing starts. The industrial data are expected to indicate a slowing economy, with April industrial production falling five-tenths of 1 percent and factory use at 84.2 percent, compared with 84.9 percent in March.
Housing reports, however, may be up but traders are likely to dismiss them as lagging indicators that say little about the future of the economy.
"I think the outlook is rosy and bullish for now," Mr. Sohn of Norwest said. One of the principal reasons for rising stock prices is the rally in bonds, which fell sharply last year.
"Bonds are reversing the carnage of last year," he said, "and getting back to the long-term trend," which is for higher bond prices and lower long-term interest rates. As bond prices rise, corporate borrowing costs go down, helping stocks.
Another major reason for the bullish sentiment for both stocks and bonds, Mr. Sohn said, is the deficit-cutting measures by the Republican leadership in Congress. Wall Street is focusing less on the specific amount of money proposed for cuts, some $1 trillion or more, but on the Republican determination to cut large amounts from the budget.
"In the past, talking about cutbacks in Medicare, for example, would have been immediate political suicide," Mr. Sohn said. "Now the leadership is actually willing to talk about it and that's new."
Indeed, the relative stability of the dollar, indicating that more and more traders are buying the American currency, removes the last argument for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, as a way of attracting foreign investment, analysts say.
Dollar strength "removes a barrier to actually cutting interest rates rather than just leaving them alone," said William Dodge, chief investment strategist for Dean Witter. But job creation and unemployment data will be closely watched by traders, he said, to see when, or if, the Fed cuts rates.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was below normal, with 314.8 million shares changing hands, about 6 percent below this year's daily average of 334 million shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.11 points, to 284.01, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,373 to 902. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.55 point, to 488.31.
Among the advancing stocks was Hyperion Software, which rose 3 1/4, to 37 1/2, after a Soundview Financial Group analyst reiterated his recommendation of the stock as a "strong buy." Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment house, rose 3 1/4, to 78 3/8, as investors bet that the rally in stocks would also benefit brokerage houses.
Among the declining stocks was the Crop Growers Corporation, which markets crop insurances. It fell 5 1/2, to 24 1/4, after it reported a sharp surge in first-quarter earnings, but which analysts attributed to new Government legislation rather than the company's operations.
Exx Inc. class A and class B stock fell after the maker of toys based on the popular Mighty Morphin Power Rangers reported a sharp rise in first-quarter earnings on Friday. Both classes of shares had risen before the announcement. The class A shares fell 2 1/8, to 15 5/8, and the class B 2 5/8, to 14 3/4.

HEADLINE: An Uphill Journey to Japan;
How the Price of a Jeep CLimbs 64% After Leaving the Factory

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 15

 BODY:
Jeep Cherokee No. SL542455 rolled off the assembly line last Oct. 9 at the Chrysler Corporation's plant in Toledo, Ohio. It left the factory with a price tag of an estimated $19,100.
But in a cramped showroom here in Japan, the retail price for such a car is now $31,372 -- about 64 percent higher -- at the current exchange rates. 
 This Jeep is a brilliant blue Sport model, with six roaring cylinders, automatic transmission and a power steering wheel on the right-hand side. A comparable model would have a sticker price of $20,698 in the United States. But this particular car did not just go from ship to showroom the way American-made Japanese cars do.
Instead, it took a much longer route -- first through a maze of tests, regulatory requirements and form-filling, and then through a complex web of relationships with distributors and dealers. It is all part of a system that drives the price of imported cars sharply higher and that American trade negotiators say helps to make Japan a market sheltered to benefit domestic auto makers.
After 20 months of bitter negotiations, Washington plans to announce on Tuesday that it will retaliate by imposing punitive tariffs on Japanese luxury cars within the next 30 days unless Tokyo relents. But the journey of Jeep Cherokee No. SL542455 illustrates the magnitude of the problem and the unlikelihood of a quick fix. For few of the added costs are particularly onerous or demonstrably unfair in themselves.
And even if Tokyo agreed to meet the American demands, perhaps making it easier for Detroit to sell more vehicles in Japan, it is still unlikely that the huge increase in the sticker price of imported American cars would decrease by much. Indeed, the current trade dispute focuses on opening the market for auto parts and putting more American cars into showrooms in Japan, not on eliminating this bureaucratic procedure or that quality check.
Still, underlying the confrontation between Washington and Tokyo is the intense, almost overwhelming frustration that Detroit's Big Three auto makers feel in trying to penetrate an unfamiliar Japanese market. And what is true for imported automobiles is also true for Japanese business practices over all, which tend to favor producers at the expense of consumers and make nearly all goods -- but especially foreign products -- substantially more expensive than elsewhere.
"The talks are all about the system itself, the fact that Japan is not as easy to sell into as the United States," said Peter Boardman, an auto analyst at UBS Securities Ltd. To Jerry K. Hsu, in charge of Japanese sales at the Chrysler International Corporation, the basic problem is that "it's an unlevel playing field."
In most countries, for example, Chrysler finds it fairly easy to market its cars through local distributors or its own subsidiaries. In Japan, by contrast, car dealers have such close ties with the domestic auto makers that they either refuse to sell American imports or put them in out-of-the-way showrooms.
When Japanese companies import their own American-made cars to Japan, they still need to comply with Government regulations. But they can translate their familiarity with the system into cost savings because they know how to take short cuts. And European auto makers have done better in Japan than Americans, primarily because they ship luxury models to buyers who are relatively unconcerned about price.
Conversely, Japanese-made cars exported to the United States roll off the ships into the fast lane to their dealers. So, even though the strong yen should help bring down prices in Japan while making Japanese goods more costly in the United States, the sticker price of the Jeep Cherokee is about 52 percent higher in Japan than in America, while the price of the Toyota Motor Corporation's American-made Avalon goes up only 28 percent in Japan.
Even more telling, the price of Toyota's Japanese-made Land Cruiser wagon is 17 percent lower when it is sold in the United States today. The company says that higher trucking and marketing costs, as well as options included on all cars sold here, increase the costs in Japan.
To be sure, Detroit is selling more cars in Japan these days. Jeep sales alone are expected to surge by more than 50 percent this year, to 20,000, from 13,000 in 1994. Chrysler has made some headway in overcoming the obstacles in its path, and with the dollar still weak, it is making a lot of money on every car sold. It might do even better if it goes through with plans to spend tens of millions of dollars on its own distribution system.
Even so, the sticker-price inflation that afflicted the ride of Jeep Cherokee No. SL542455 to the showroom floor in Japan is likely to slow the efforts of Chrysler to carve a meaningful presence in Japan. The Japanese distribution system, in short, will continue to rob Detroit's Big Three of much of their price advantage by the time the Japanese consumer gets a chance to kick American car tires.
Tracing the maze is not much easier than navigating it. Chrysler and other companies provided several cost figures but declined to disclose the exact prices at which they purchased or sold the Jeeps. So only rough estimates can be used to track the steady buildup of costs from the American wholesale price of an estimated $19,100.
In switching the price to yen, Chrysler must use a reasonable conversion rate, say 92 yen to $1, that will hold throughout the duration of the sale process. Thus, when the dollar weakens to 86 yen, the level at which it was trading yesterday, Chrysler receives a foreign exchange gain of $1,333 on each car sold.
Chrysler has tried to pass some of the gain along to consumers. In response to the weaker dollar, it recently lowered sticker prices by 10 percent, from the earlier 2,998,000 yen.
Jeep Cherokee No. SL542455 went by rail from the factory to a port in Baltimore. There, it was waxed protectively and various adjustments were made to adapt it to Japanese regulations, a process known as homologation. For example, Chrysler must insert heat-sensitive warning lights in the dashboard to alert a driver that a muffler is overheating.
The Jeep was then shipped at a cost of $200 through the Panama Canal and across the Pacific Ocean to the Japanese port of Chiba, arriving on Nov. 28. In Chiba, Chrysler turned over the ownership of the car to its importer, Chrysler Japan Sales Ltd., a joint venture in which Chrysler has a minor stake with J. Osawa & Company. Dock workers drove No. SL542455 and 621 other Jeeps from the ship to a parking lot, where employees of Chrysler Japan inspected the vehicles for dents and scratches.
The Jeeps cleared customs on Dec. 2, at a cost of $682 each, a relatively small fee. From there, they were trucked 50 miles to an inspection center run by one of Chrysler's two distributors, Seibu Motor Sales. Adding shipping and customs-clearance costs and the Chrysler exchange-rate bonus, the car carried a price tag of an estimated $21,315.
At that point, the importer took the car through a second homologation, including a five-minute brake test and a 20-minute test on exhaust levels in a specially built complex. The total cost of the homologations -- which are far more detailed than anything required in the United States -- on both sides of the Pacific was $1,100, increasing the price tag to $22,415.
Chrysler, however, still needed to show compliance with Japan's 238 regulations, a cumbersome effort that culminates in a 560-page book of documents. In the United States, the documentation can just about fit on a page. In response to previous complaints, Japan has speeded up the process. The cars breezed through a Government inspection in hours instead of the previous norm of seven days.
But the costs for the importer, Chrysler Japan, had only begun to rack up. It had to pay for trucking; make substantial rent payments for cramped quarters in an old building owned by its parent company; offer occasional rebates to distributors; spend millions of dollars each year on advertising and pay the salaries for 60 employees. While Japanese companies face similar expenses, they can spread those mostly fixed costs over a much larger number of vehicles than Chrysler, with its tiny share of the market.
Chrysler Japan will not disclose its profit margin on the Cherokee, but analysts estimate that it is 5 percent to 8 percent of the retail price of the car, or at least $1,569. That would bring the price tag so far to $23,984.
On Feb. 8 Jeep Cherokee No. SL542455 went through a beauty makeover at a Seibu inspection center, where employees checked for missing parts like floor mats, cigarette lighters and spare keys, removed the wax coating and made another search for scratches.
They polished the car again, to satisfy pickier Japanese consumers, and added options valued at $200, as well as the obligatory Japanese-made accessories like special side steps. Seibu also took a margin of 5 percent to 6 percent, or $1,725. Those two factors increased the cost of the car to $25,909.
In the United States, the margins to importers and distributors have been kept low, because Japanese car makers there have a much freer hand to set up their own subsidiaries to import and distribute. In Japan, high property costs and a longtime practice of limiting foreign ownership meant that Chrysler had to rely on Japanese distributors.
On April 3 Seibu received an order for a Jeep Cherokee from the Osawa Motor Sales Company, one of 406 dealerships in Japan that carry the Jeep. At the tiny Osawa Motors showroom in an out-of-the-way neighborhood in Tokyo, one Jeep and three Alfa Romeos crowded the floor. Masayoshi Iwamoto, who manages the dealership, said he paid $24,000 a month in rent, which is low by Tokyo's standards.
Mr. Iwamoto's dealership is different because it is controlled by a distributor, Seibu, rather than a Japanese manufacturer. He has an arrangement to sell cars made by Fiat S.p.A. of Italy that allows him to sell Jeeps, because they do not compete with the Fiat Alfa Romeos.
On April 8 Jeep Cherokee No. SL542455 was delivered to the dealership's showroom in Nagoya, about 75 miles from Tokyo, with a sticker price of $31,372. That would give the dealer a profit of $5,463. The buyer, a 28-year-old credit analyst, negotiated the price down to $30,209, but then paid a consumption tax of $906, for a total of $31,115.
Much of the high markup of the dealer can be attributed to the services it provides. For example, when a car it has sold breaks down, a salesman goes to the customer's home or office to pick it up for servicing, sometimes providing a temporary replacement. When the repairs are finished, the salesman drives the car back to the customer's home.
"We want to take care of the customer, but are we going beyond satisfying the customer?" said Mr. Hsu of Chrysler International. "Everything they do drives up the cost."

Later it will be checked for compliance with a total of 238 Japanese regulations. The process has been shortened to just a few hours from what was once seven days.
 
+ $1,569
$22,884
The distributor takes its cut
Chrysler Japan trucks the Jeep 50 miles to one of Chrysler's two Japanese distributors, Seibu Motor Sales, and takes a profit of about $1,569.
 
+ $1,100
$23,984
'Homologation' adds to the cost
Seibu inspects the car again, adapting it for the Japanese market and adding certain required equipment and accessories. (Some of this work was done in the United States by Chrysler.) Cost: $1,100.
 
+ $1,925
$25,909
More options and a makeover
Seibu employees inspect the car once more on Feb. 8, checking for scratches and missing parts like floor mats and cigarette lighters. They remove the protective shipping wax, polish the car and install some optional equipment ($200), and Seibu takes its profit (about $1,725).
 
STICKER PRICE
$31,372
Last stop: Nagoya Japan
Seibu gets gets an order from Osawa Motor Sales on April 3 and ships the Jeep to Osawa's showroom in Nagoya. When it arrives on April 8, it gets a sticker price (set by Chrysler) of $31,372 at the current exchange rates. A customer agrees to but it for $30,209, and pays $906 tax on the purchase.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
When Is an Ally?

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
For America, the purpose and test of power is the ability to get things done that protect its security and interests or ward off dangers to them. In the use of power -- economic, political or military -- America can act alone or with allies.
What is an ally? Who are America's? And when? Full time? Or as temps, now and then? 
 At a time when Americans are increasingly edgy about using military power, will America use its economic might to protect its security? Will America's allies help?
If not, are we willing to use that economic power to force our allies, plus Russia or China, to respect our security and interests -- or at least not interfere with them? If not, is the U.S. still a superpower, or is it playing expensive games of self-delusion?
The questions rise out of Iran's plans to produce nuclear power that could be used for nuclear weaponry. The U.S. believes making Iran an economic outcast would stop Teheran. But Russia and China keep selling Iran the technology, materials and specialists of nuclear potential. Western Europe acts as if economic pressure against a terrorist state is an idea indelicate beyond the point of obscenity.
Iran now says it is not building one nuclear plant. It plans to build ten over the next two decades.
Ten -- that is not simply a number. It is a strategy, defensive and offensive. In 1981 Israel knocked out Iraq's nuclear weapon drive by a surprise strike on one plant. Iran's strategy scatters plants around the country, making a pre-emptive strike virtually impossible.
U.S. experts say Iran will be capable of producing material for nuclear weapons in three to five years. And Kenneth Timmerman, the enormously knowledgeable arms expert, reports in The Washington Times that for six years Iran has built stockpiles of uranium and other weapons-grade material, unguarded and uninspected.
A nuclear Iran would be a threat to the Persian Gulf states, Israel and Turkey and every other object on its hate list, headed of course by the U.S. Would Iran supply nuclear weapons to its protege terrorist groups? The mere possibility would hugely increase their power.
President Clinton did what his predecessors did not: he ordered an embargo on American trade with Iran. That removed Iran from the American market, and a burden of hypocrisy from the U.S.
But Germany, Japan, Italy, France and other U.S. allies that have been selling high-technology tools, pesticides or other products so useful in modern war told Mr. Clinton to take his embargo and run along. Communist China and North Korea have not been that courteous. They just send more material, missiles and specialists to Iran.
In Moscow, President Yeltsin was appreciative of President Clinton's visit -- but not enough to cancel Russia's deal to build a nuclear plant in Iran, the centerpiece of the new Iranian network.
Having cut off its own trade, the U.S. can and should now let our allies, plus Russia and China, know what it will do to persuade them to help prevent a nuclear Iran.
Next month at a meeting in Halifax of major industrial nations, including Russia, the U.S. will try again to convince them to join in economic measures against Iran.
But they should also be told that if President Clinton fails, either he or Congress will bar imports into the U.S. of companies that do business with Iran -- as formally proposed by Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Representative Peter King and other legislators.
Europe would be shocked -- they don't believe Mr. Clinton has it in him. Even Beijing might be less haughty. The companies peddling equipment and specialists to Iran are part of the economic empire of the Chinese Army, which provides a superb cash flow to the Politburo.
If Mr. Yeltsin turns the U.S. down again, Washington will have to choose between the likelihood of making more Russian nationalists mad at him and the certainty of making Iran nuclear. Closing U.S. ports to imports of Russian companies and agencies that build Iran's nuclear capability might work. If not -- then suspend American aid. Anything else would turn the U.S. from Mr. Yeltsin's friend to his hostage.
The goal is to block Iranian nuclear power. But there's a bonus -- getting some clear answers to the questions in the opening paragraphs of this column.

HEADLINE: New York Commits Budget Suicide

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"In New York, the Dying Days of Expansive Government" (front page, May 8) lays out a familiar argument: Slash government spending so we can cut taxes; then people can spend more and stimulate the economy. But much of what would be cut is essential for New York to be an effective, working community. 
 You don't get much support these days arguing that budget cuts will damage the lives of defenseless people. But if we cripple New York's infrastructure, we won't keep jobs, businesses and taxpayers around very long, regardless of tax cuts.
What happens if we cut mental health, alcoholism and drug treatment programs; cut off welfare for supposedly "employable" men and women after 60 days, and reduce housing assistance?
We would have tens of thousands more homeless and mentally ill people on our streets. What will that do to New York's attractiveness as a place to live and do business?
Gov. George E. Pataki wants to cut Medicaid spending by more than $3 billion -- half of it Federal matching aid we'd give back to Washington. Put aside for a moment what that will do to the elderly, disabled, and children who depend on it.
When hospitals lose Medicaid funds (more than $1 billion under the Governor's budget), they don't lay off nurses and doctors who only treat Medicaid patients. Even the wealthiest New Yorker who is wheeled in with a heart attack will get poorer quality care. Many will die.
New York's world-class hospitals depend on Medicaid revenue. Undermine them and you undermine New York's attractiveness to executives who make job-location decisions.
The Governor would cut more than $1 billion from the State and City Universities and from elementary and secondary schools. How can we thrive in the modern world if our young people go looking for work with a poorer quality education?
It hurts our economy if transit cutbacks mean that a business executive has to wonder when employees will arrive for work.
Thousands of years ago on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, villagers got together to build irrigation systems and huts to store grain. Ever since then, any community's ability to work and succeed has depended on its public sector.
Governor Pataki said in his State of the State Message, "When government takes responsibility for people, people stop taking responsibility for themselves." He's got it backward. When government shirks its responsibilities, our communities and our people cannot grow and prosper.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
For the Pirates, the Past Is a Lonely Hideaway

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
As Frank Sinatra said, when he could still put the words to good music, there used to be a ball park here. It was Forbes Field, and it served as the home park of the Pittsburgh Pirates for 61 years. Remnants of the park serve as reminders that before there were University of Pittsburgh buildings, there was a ball park here.
The center field wall, with its "457 FT" sign, and the right-center wall, with its "436 FT" marking, stand next to the building that houses the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business. Home plate, the home plate that was in the ground for the last game in 1970, survives, too. It is under glass in the lobby of Forbes Quadrangle, home of the university's anthropology, black studies, economics and political science departments, among others. 
 Clemente Drive separates the buildings. Where the great Roberto once roamed, cars drive along, the occupants of most unaware of the sacred ground they violate but some occasionally stopping to gaze at the wall and remember.
The irony is that when the city and the team get around to building a new ball park, it will be Forbes Field, preferably without the view-obstructing posts. Three Rivers Stadium, the cookie-cutter multi-purpose edifice, has outlived its usefulness. Circumstances cry out for the new "old-fashioned" park of the type that has been a huge hit in Baltimore, Cleveland and Texas.
If the Pirates are to get a new home, they can only hope their timing matches that of the Indians, who not only have moved into a new park but also have moved into contending status for the first time in more than four decades. Like many of those Indians teams of the intervening period, the 1995 Pirates are dreadful.
"The thing that eats at me is when people ask what's wrong with this team," Jim Leyland, the Pirates' beleaguered manager, said yesterday by telephone from Los Angeles. "They expect us to be competing for a division title. I'm not going to try to fool people."
Leyland, as good a manager as baseball has, surprised people last week when he basically exploded at a questioner asking what was wrong with the Pirates. Thinking the answer should be obvious, Leyland said the Pirates have about nine players who belong in Class AAA and about five who should be in Class AA. That's the minor leagues.
Furthermore, he pointed out to anyone who had missed their departure, the Pirates no longer have the players who helped them win three consecutive division championships -- Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla, Doug Drabek, John Smiley, Andy Van Slyke.
The Pirate owners, giving a Tony-winning performance in their role of the hapless, helpless and hopeless small-market team, like to talk about how they couldn't afford to sign those players to prevent them from leaving. But with most of those stars, the Pirates chose to play economic hardball every step of the negotiating way rather than try to work out long-term, less expensive deals before the players could become free agents.
The Indians have executed that strategy remarkably well with their young stars, accomplishing their economic and talent goals before they became contenders. The Pirates became contenders without a signing strategy. That's why they are a contender no longer.
The new owner hopes to change all that. That is, he will if he becomes the new owner. John Rigas, a cable television entrepreneur, has been negotiating with the current owners and city officials for months trying to reach an agreement. The mental health of anyone desirous of buying a baseball team in these uncertain times is instantly questioned, but Rigas approaches the venture with sound mind and vision.
The primary hangup in the negotiations has been the desire of the current owners to have Rigas assume the losses they will incur this season, before the transaction is completed. Mayor Tom Murphy appears ready to help get the two parties over that hurdle.
On the other hand, some people familiar with the negotiations feel that some corporate members of ownership wouldn't mind having the deal fall through so they could sell the club for more money to a buyer who would move the Pirates to a city without a team.
The group that has owned the Pirates for nearly 10 years is a weird conglomeration of three individuals, one university, two banks and four major corporations. They apparently are not all civic-minded.
City officials would do everything possible to short-circuit any effort to move the team. Mayor Murphy has been aggressive in his behind-the-scenes efforts, and they could lead to a handshake agreement soon. To enhance the Pirates as an attraction and make it possible for a new owner to flourish, officials also know it's imperative to find a way to build a new Forbes Field.
Nothing will help the Pirates this season. The team is bad, and the crowds reflect its sad state. For the first eight home dates, the Pirates are 30,000 behind last year's attendance. Four of their crowds have been in the 7,000 range, a level they didn't see in the corresponding period a year ago.
"The bottom line is you have to put a good product on the field," Leyland said. "That entices the people. They're not staying away just because of the strike. It's because of the way we're playing. If we had the team we had in '91, they'd be coming out. They'd be teed off, but they'd be coming out. The only way to get them back is to have a good team, put a good product out there and treat the people the way they should be treated."

HEADLINE: A Driving Force Off Broadway

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

 BODY:
"Don't worry; it's not a real dead body," Ben Sprecher said reassuringly, leading the way into his theater.
In the bed center stage at the Promenade was the withered corpse of C, the otherwise nameless protagonist of "Three Tall Women," which is now in its second profitable year at Mr. Sprecher's profitable theater. 
 "We do Theaterworks in here on weekends," he continued, "and one time the lights were off and Sheldon Harnick was groping around in the dark and found it. I thought he was going to die."
Mr. Sprecher, too, was in the right place at the right time when the theater world, searching for a way out of the nightmarish economics of Broadway, stumbled on him.
Only about a dozen desirable Off Broadway theaters are available for rent. Mr. Sprecher owns or manages three of them: the Promenade on the Upper West Side, the Variety Arts in the East Village and the Lucille Lortel in Greenwich Village. All three are bustling: the 399-seat Promenade has the Pulitzer-winning play by Edward Albee; the 499-seat Variety Arts has "Death Defying Acts," a trio of one-acts by Woody Allen, David Mamet and Elaine May that opened to rave reviews, and the 299-seat Lortel just closed "Camping With Henry and Tom," which won an award as best Off Broadway play. (Admittedly, it looked a little awkward because it was the Lucille Lortel Award, which Miss Lortel underwrites and votes on and Mr. Sprecher administers, but a battery of independent critics voted, too.)
Plays are lined up to fill them. Steve Martin's "Picasso at the Lapin Agile" has put down a deposit on the Promenade; four or five plays are angling for the Variety Arts when "Death Defying Acts" peters out. The Lortel already has Uta Hagen in "Mrs. Klein" booked for the fall and will probably tide itself over the summer with a one-woman show about Marlene Dietrich starring a Norwegian actress named Torill.
Producers who have been known to be peevish give raves to Mr. Sprecher's managerial skills.
"He has carte blanche with the theater, which is the highest compliment we can pay anybody," said Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert chain, which has a reputation for running its theaters well. It owns 10 percent of the Variety Arts.
Even the producer James Freydberg, who had a screaming fight with Mr. Sprecher last year when Mr. Freydberg posted a closing notice on his play "Those the River Keeps" before it opened in a maneuver to try to get his rent deposit back to spend on advertising the play if the reviews were good.
Mr. Freydberg, who has produced three plays at the Promenade, still says: "Ben's extremely honest, not at all slippery, like some of the Off Broadway owners I've done business with. A deal's a deal with him, and no nonsense.
"Plus, his theaters are impeccably managed. The bathrooms are clean; the seats aren't broken; the box office is courteous. He understands that the patron needs to be respected.
"The only thing he does that drives me crazy is that even though he's rooting for you while you're in previews, he's out trying to rent the theater in case you fail. He's overanxious."
Anxiety works for Mr. Sprecher. He's the rare Off Broadway type routinely spotted in French cuffs and a yellow power tie who can also, like an actor, offer an 8-by-10 glossy of himself and fax over a succinct biography. Ask producers who've worked with him for a funny Ben Sprecher anecdote, and they draw blanks. "Hmm . . . gee . . . he's a real professional" is the standard reply.
But someone who was across the table from him during the last contract talks with the press agents' union called him "arrogant and really tough."
"It was like being hit with a ton of bricks," said the press agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Of course," he reflected, "that may have been just a tactic."
As treasurer of the League of Off Broadway Theaters, Mr. Sprecher is a lead negotiator.
"Oh, sure, tough," said Elizabeth McCann, the producer of "Three Tall Women." "He amuses me because sometimes feels he has to be really firm. And I say, 'Oh, c'mon, Grumpy. You know you're really Bashful.' "
Mr. Sprecher, 40, is the son of a pharmacist and a high school teacher. He grew up in the San Fernando Valley of California, a gymnast and water-skier who studied theater design at California State University at Northridge.
He did the lighting for the rock group Earth, Wind and Fire and ran a San Diego dinner theater before moving to New York in 1975 to be a stage manager at Town Hall. He soon shifted to tours and was constantly on the road with shows like "A Little Night Music," "The World of Sholom Aleichem" and "The Mitzi Gaynor Show."
"By 1981, I got tired of never unpacking my bags, and Lucille Lortel had an opening," he said. "It looked good. As a theater manager, you're never out of work."
At 26, he was sure he knew where Broadway was heading, and he wanted his own theater. He found the Promenade, a former theater and church in a building at Broadway and 76th Street that was changing from a welfare hotel into co-ops. A hunt for investors brought him to William P. Miller, a semi-retired securities lawyer who prodded his partners to buy in "as a recreational investment."
"Hurlyburly," a David Rabe play that churned movie stars through the cast, put the theater on the map in 1984.
The economics are Spartan. The house can sell about $110,000 worth of tickets a week; the actors earn Off Broadway scale ($544 a week minimum, versus about $975 on Broadway). The box office has two people, not five, as a Broadway theater might. "Three Tall Women" has a wardrobe mistress and shares Mr. Sprecher's two house stagehands. On Sundays and Mondays, James Lecesne's one-man show "Word of Mouth" plays in front of the Albee set. At lunchtime on weekends, the Theaterworks/USA children's theater performs. Tucking in extra shows, nearly impossible under Broadway contracts, makes a theater far more efficient.
In 1990, Mr. Sprecher raised $1.5 million to buy the Variety Arts, a 1911 nickelodeon house that had sunk to running porn films. "Bill and I went in to take a look," he said, "and he's watching the movie while I'm going, 'Y'know, it's column-free. It's got a balcony. I could build a theater in here.' "
Presumably, he will outgrow managing the Lortel. Miss Lortel said recently that she would leave it in her will to someone who loves theater and needs a home. "Like the Signature Theater," she said, "or Andre Bishop if he didn't have his own place at Lincoln Center."
He could still manage it, she said. Mr. Sprecher declined to discuss that but has higher ambitions. He is producing shows at the Lortel: he was behind "Annie Warbucks" and is behind "Word of Mouth." He is working on a burlesque revue called "Variety Scandals" and a new John Pielmayer play, "Voices in the Dark."
He shuns the sobriquet "the Shubert of Off Broadway," pinned on him by Theater Week magazine, but he is still hunting for one more theater.
He's picky. It must have 499 seats and not be in a "questionable location," but be outside the "Broadway grid" -- Avenue of the Americas to Ninth Avenue from 34th to 72d Street -- because, he said, "once you're eligible for Tonys, you get a lot of problems."
It took "Death Defying Acts" to beat the questionable-location jinx on the Variety Arts, on Third Avenue at 13th Street.
He opened that house with "Return to the Forbidden Planet" on Sept. 27, 1991. The very next night, he married Amy Smukler, an actress whose picture he spotted in a stack of resumes. Why? Because it saved his parents a second trip from California. Efficiency works for him, too.

HEADLINE: Mental Illness Found Rising in Poor Nations

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 15

 BODY:
Mental illness and behavioral problems are on the increase in the world's poorest nations, even as advances are made against debilitating or fatal physical diseases, a team of experts assembled by Harvard Medical School said here today.
The deterioration in mental and social health threatens more violence, ethnic conflict and instability in developing nations, the team warned in a study prepared by 88 specialists from 30 countries. The study, "World Mental Health: Problems and Priorities in Low-Income Countries," being published as a book by Oxford University Press, was issued here as part of an effort by the authors to involve the United Nations in drawing attention to the problem. 
 "It is a myth that mental health is not a serious global problem," Arthur Kleinman, a co-author and the originator of the study, said in an interview from Boston on Sunday before coming to New York today to present the findings to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
"Nothing could be farther from the truth," said Dr. Kleinman, an anthropologist and psychiatrist who has been studying mental health in Asia, primarily China, since 1968. He is calling for a world summit meeting on the issue, similar to those held in recent years on population and poverty. "The problem is broad, not just neuropsychiatric disorders, but also behavioral problems like substance abuse and violence."
There is an important link to the United Nations, Dr. Kleinman said. "What this book does is demonstrate that major demographic shifts, ethnic conflict, refugee movements, internal displacement, the international drug trade, the growth of megacities and to some extent economic restructuring have contributed to these problems."
The experts found that in many countries rapid social and economic changes are creating special stresses on the elderly.
Dr. Kleinman said national governments as well as international organizations needed to focus on mental and behavioral problems, which are often relegated to the margins of policy in some countries because of the stigma attached to the mentally ill.
Yet in many poor countries of what is called the global South there are imaginative and successful small efforts to deal with personal and community breakdowns, Dr. Kleinman said.
He described programs in Thailand in which Buddhist monks work with narcotics abusers and in Malaysia, where healers called "drug bomohs" treat heroin addiction in communal settings. In South India, women enrolled in an adult literacy program in Andhra Pradesh became the core of a large women's movement against alcoholism. More than 6,000 local liqour shops were closed in the state. In Swaziland, in southern Africa, community mental health programs involve traditional healers, public health workers and family members.
In many areas of the world, locally available herbs and familiar practices -- acupuncture, for example, or massage -- are employed.
These kinds of programs need national and international support, Dr. Kleinman said. "Few local intervention programs in the South are implemented at the national level," he said.
Among the findings of the study, conducted by Harvard Medical School's department of social medicine with the support of several foundations, are these:
*Mental retardation and epilepsy rates are up to five times as high in poor nations as they are in richer ones. In certain Asian and African nations, up to 90 percent of sufferers go untreated because anti-convulsive medications are not available or are too expensive.
*Reported schizophrenia cases in poor countries are likely to rise to 24.4 million by the century's end from 16.5 million in 1985. By 2025, three-quarters of the world's dementia cases will be in the developing world.
*Domestic violence and the abuse of children is high in many low-income societies. From 20 to 75 percent of married women in developing countries are victims of domestic violence. The use of minors in the commercial sex industry and slavery, and the abandonment of unwanted children are becoming "endemic" in many parts of the world.
*More than 40 million refugees and internally displaced people run a high risk of depression, anxiety disorders and other forms of mental distress caused by political violence.
The report recommends a major world initiative to upgrade mental health services in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, with emphasis on the training of more health workers.
The researchers say that mental and behavioral problems cannot be isolated from general health and adverse living conditions, including poverty, high unemployment, overcrowding and sex discrimination.
Dr. Veena Das of the Delhi School of Economics in India, said at a news conference here today that ignoring mental and behavioral problems could have consequences not only in economic growth but also in political development, as societies become cynical about politicians' ability to deal with fundamental social disruptions.
"One reason why governments will be made to pay attention is precisely because in countries like India the future of democracy may be at stake," she said.

HEADLINE: Future of Endangered Species Act in Doubt as Law Is Debated

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
THE Endangered Species Act, hailed by its supporters as the strongest conservation law in the world, has come under heavy criticism in Congress, and its future is in doubt.
Although the act seemed to champion odd creatures like the snail darter and the furbish lousewort, it has been used by conservationists for a broader purpose: protecting whole ecosystems and their associated plants and animals, as in the case of the spotted owl, whose protection may have saved the old growth forests of the Pacific Northwest. 
 This bold and effective use of the act affected loggers, landowners and property-rights advocates, who are seeking radical changes in the 22-year-old act that is now up for renewal. One of the favored instruments of opponents of the act is a bill introduced last week by Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, that in effect would abolish the Government's principal method of enforcing the law on private property: fines or imprisonment for those who destroy the habitat of an endangered species.
The bill would also eliminate other important protections of the law, including its objective of conserving "the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend."
"The Gorton bill upends every aspect of the act," said John Kostyack, counsel for the National Wildlife Federation.
A memorandum by a Gorton aide that came to light last month shows that representatives of timber, mining, ranching and utility interests were heavily involved in drawing up the bill.
House Republicans are preparing their own bill. Meanwhile, another measure already passed by the House would require the Government to compensate landowners whose property values are reduced by Federal regulation, including those under the Endangered Species Act. The Clinton Administration supports the act, though it would like to see it made less onerous for small landowners. The outcome of the impending political fight is uncertain but environmentalists fear that one way or another, the law is in grave danger.
Opponents of the Endangered Species Act raise a number of objections. For one, they assert that its regulation of habitat exerts a drag on the economy, driving down land values and "locking up" large acreages so that they cannot generate economic growth. They cite a number of studies by real estate, agricultural and timber interests to support their case.
One such study, by the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, concluded that real estate values had been depressed in vast stretches of the Texas hill country where the endangered golden-cheeked warbler lives. Turmoil over endangered species has been especially strong and visible there, and landowners throughout the the hill country are reportedly destroying potential warbler habitats to escape the possible consequences of the law.
Asserting that the act had turned into "a growth control ordinance," Representative Richard W. Pombo, a conservative Republican from California who heads a special House panel that is developing legislation on the subject, said, "We're going to try to stop that."
But conservationists, arguing that protected habitat often enhanced the value of neighboring land, cite contrary studies. For example, a recent analysis by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Project on Environmental Politics and Policy, found that while endangered-species listings might cause some local harm, economic data "strongly contradict the assertion that the Endangered Species Act has had harmful effects on state economies."
Dr. Stephen M. Meyer, director of the M.I.T. analysis, says the warbler study, when corrected for analytical errors, shows there is no difference in real estate values between Texas counties with and without endangered species habitat.
A second argument by opponents of the act is that the owners of land where endangered species have been declared to live have not been compensated for the fall in their property values.
Conservationists say instances of property value loss are not widespread but they agree there should be some mechanism to relieve owners who are genuinely affected by the act. "From a private landowner's point of view, the Endangered Species Act looks like a nuclear weapon," said George Frampton, Assistant Secretary of the Interior for fish, wildlife and parks.
A third contention by the act's opponents is that endangered species can be protected without saving every subspecies and subpopulation. "Do you really need 65 subspecies?" House Speaker Newt Gingrich has asked. Biologists reply that many subspecies and subpopulations are indeed needed because it is impossible to predict which genetic strain has the best chance of assuring the species' survival in the long run.
How well has the act worked in practice? Conservation biologists generally see the law as "the most effective tool in the tool kit for preserving this country's biological diversity," said Dr. Dennis D. Murphy of Stanford University, president-elect of the Society for Conservation Biology. In particular, he said, the law has become the "hammer" that forces disputing parties to the table to work out compromises that protect species and their habitats from encroachments of development.
As to whether the act has worked as well as it could, Dr. Murphy said, "the answer is unequivocally no." But he fears that "the 104th Congress is going to throw out the baby with the bath water."
The bare numbers show how many American plants and animals are in dire need of the act's protection. More than 950 domestic species of plants and animals and more than 560 foreign species, which are protected in trade, are currently listed as endangered or imminently threatened with endangerment. More than 3,900 others, accounting for 3 percent of all known species in the country, are candidates for listing. Nearly two-thirds of mammals are either listed or candidates, along with 14 percent of birds, 12 percent of plants and 10 percent of fish.
The good news is that although only seven species have recovered enough to be removed from the domestic roster of imperilment, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service says that nearly 40 percent of the listed domestic species are either stable or improving.
What can be done to reconcile the needs of species and their habitats with those of the private economy?
The Clinton Administration, agreeing with many conservation biologists, has adopted a strategy of relying first on Federal lands, which are at least nominally protected by a variety of conservation laws. Where private land is unavoidably involved, Mr. Frampton says, the act has the flexibility to allow for a number of innovative tactics now being tried.
For example, some real estate developers are being required to pay a fee for destroying habitat. The fee then goes into a fund to buy other tracts of habitat or to buy permanent conservation easements from private landowners. The object is to stitch together a large habitat block or network. Advocates of this "mitigation" arrangement liken the assessment on developers to "impact" fees that are routinely paid to help provide schools and streets.
The Clinton Administration has taken the lead, along with some states like California, in moving toward regional conservation plans based on this principle, encompassing whole ecosystems and multiple species. The most notable example, perhaps, is in Southern California, where the endangered California gnatcatcher has been the catalyst for a regional multispecies protection plan.
No one considers this type of solution to be perfect. These types of plans are still "rough-hewn," says Dr. Murphy, not least because scientists are not yet able to identify which patches of land are most important. Moreover, the approach still imposes some cost on those who develop the land, and it allows some habitat to be destroyed. In many instances, Dr. Murphy says, there is not enough habitat to begin with, meaning that what is left must be intensively managed by humans.
Still, the mitigation approach, which Mr. Pombo says he favors, appears to provide some landowners with an incentive, by virtue of being paid for a permanent conservation easement, to conserve habitat rather than destroy it. Many parties, including some environmentalists, have strongly advocated incorporating positive incentives into the act.
The Gorton bill provides for federally financed incentives to state and local governments for the planning and execution of habitat conservation plans on land they own or control. Some conservationists envision the setting up of a Federal conservation trust fund that would dole out incentives and, as a last resort, buy private property outright for conservation purposes.
Given the tidal wave in favor of Government retrenchment and budget-cutting, that sort of ambitious program is widely considered dead for now. For many conservationists, this means that the imperfect mitigation solutions -- made workable by the carrot of positive incentives and the stick of the Endangered Species Act -- may be the best that can be hoped for just now. And so the struggle over whether to retain the stick and what incentives to provide is being joined.

HEADLINE: A Budget Harsher Than It Seems

 BODY:
Now we know how House Republicans hope to pay for the huge $350 billion tax cut they have promised -- with rosy projections of savings and revenues that may never materialize. If the forecasts go awry, the Republicans would be forced in future years to clamp down on spending even more harshly than they are now proposing.
Both Representative John Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Senator Pete Domenici, his Senate counterpart, have proposed cutting domestic discretionary spending by 30 percent to balance the budget by 2002. But Mr. Kasich needs to find far more savings than Mr. Domenici, whose plan does not include tax cuts that are heavily weighted toward upper-income families. 
 Budget experts are still puzzling over Mr. Kasich's numbers. But it is already obvious that Mr. Kasich would cut much more than Mr. Domenici from entitlements such as Medicare, Medicaid and welfare programs. To help offset tax cuts that would reach $90 billion annually in the year 2002, Mr. Kasich would chop Medicare by $25 billion more than Mr. Domenici in that year, Medicaid by $4 billion more, welfare and other programs for the unemployed and low-income families by perhaps $8 billion more.
These Kasich add-ons are harsh, but they do not come close to paying for his tax cut. So Mr. Kasich resorts to three flights of optimism.
The Government plans to revise the formula it uses to measure inflation. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expects the change to lower the official inflation rate, which would reduce the amount Washington pays in Social Security and pension benefits. Mr. Kasich estimates that the budget savings from the new formula will be three times larger -- about $15 billion in 2002 -- than the C.B.O. or Mr. Domenici build into their forecasts.
Mr. Kasich also adopts a C.B.O. estimate that if Congress adopts a balanced budget it will drive interest rates down and produce a $50 billion budget savings in 2002. Many economists are uneasy about the budget office estimate, and Mr. Domenici used none of the potential savings to balance his budget. He promised instead to use the savings to cut taxes only if the interest rate drops should occur. Mr. Kasich also builds into his budget a saving of $7.5 billion in 2002 from the elimination of corporate tax loopholes -- loopholes that leaders in his party want to preserve.
The upshot is that Mr. Kasich balanced his tax cut with more than $50 billion of hope. His numbers, though not wacky, are imprudent.
Even Mr. Domenici's relatively cautious budget would impose gargantuan cuts on Medicare (15 percent), Medicaid (30 percent) and domestic discretionary spending (30 percent). Mr. Kasich would pile on steeper cuts on Medicare, Medicaid and welfare to pay for tax cuts that enrich corporations and wealthy families. Worse yet, if Mr. Kasich's optimism proves wrong, the G.O.P. could be forced to cut another $70 billion in a single year.

HEADLINE: The Mayor and the Overseers

 BODY:
Never one to welcome criticism, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has responded petulantly to critiques of New York City's budget proposals by a state fiscal monitor. The Mayor thinks it would be a good idea to eliminate the monitor's job entirely. His pique is misplaced. The worst fiscal crisis in a generation is no time to discard the very agents that lend the city needed financial credibility.
The target of Mr. Giuliani's ire is the office of State Deputy Comptroller for New York City, a monitor created as the price for the state bailing the city out from bankruptcy in 1975. But the man who signs his name at the bottom of the deputy's financial reports (and at the top of the press releases) is State Comptroller Carl McCall, a potential candidate for mayor in the next election. Mr. Giuliani is crying foul, charging that the criticism is tainted. 
 In fact, the State Comptroller's reports have been fair, calling attention to important truths about Mr. Giuliani's budget proposals. The reports cite the potential weakness of the city's economy, the budget's reliance on savings from hypothetical state actions and labor concessions, and the use of one-time-only revenues to pay for ongoing expenses, among other questionable practices.
These points are surely on target. They are a main reason why Standard & Poor's has put the city on notice of a possible downgrading of its credit rating. For a city that has gotten into so much trouble in past years because of overreliance on dubious budget assumptions and financial gimmickry, the State Comptroller's office serves as a useful early warning signal for trouble.
If the Comptroller's reports have been judicious, the same cannot be said for Mr. McCall's response to the Mayor. In his first year in office, Mr. McCall erred in too eagerly cheerleading for his friend and political ally, Mayor David Dinkins. Now, in hinting and then hedging about a run for mayor if Mr. Giuliani did not provide "effective leadership," Mr. McCall has undermined his own credibility as Comptroller and given the Mayor ammunition to use against him. Both Mr. Giuliani and Mr. McCall should settle down and recognize that their disagreements are both inevitable and healthy.
Mr. Giuliani makes a good point when he complains that the city has to pay for the cost of not only the Deputy State Comptroller's office, but the Municipal Assistance Corporation and the State Financial Control Board, two other monitoring agencies, as well. All three were created during the 1975 fiscal crisis, and it may well be time to reassess whether there is needless duplication. But there should be a presumption in favor of intense monitoring. As the city struggles to remain solvent, the Mayor has to make tough decisions on cutting the budget without eviscerating services. The monitors are one of the public's best guarantees that the numbers add up.

MASSACHUSETTS APPROVES NYNEX PRICE CAP REGULATION

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities has approved a petition by the Nynex Corporation to replace traditional "cost plus" regulation of its rates and profits with an alternative form of regulation called a price cap. The utilities department said that with the price cap, rate payers would benefit because Nynex's rates would be controlled according to a formula that accounts for inflation, productivity growth and certain other changes in costs that were beyond the control of the company. But the regulators would no longer directly control the level of Nynex's profits and the company could not pass costs of new technology on to customers. Rates for basic residential services will be frozen until August 2001.

Bond Prices Continue Rise in Light Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities continued their recent rally yesterday, with both the 30-year bond and bills of shorter maturity rising.
The long bond was up 19/32 , to a price of 10817/32 for a yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, of 6.94 percent, down from 7 percent on Friday. Bills were up an average of two basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 Trading was described as light early in the session, only to get even lighter going into the afternoon. Dealers and traders said market sentiment, however, was still bullish.
Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said that one reason bonds were higher yesterday was because "their real rates of return, or the yield less inflation, still made bonds the attractive investment."
"I think the long-bond yield is going to go anywhere between 6.25 percent and 6.50 percent over the intermediate term," he said, "as the technical forces in the market point in that direction." But, he added, "You can expect pauses along the way."
Analysts cited other reasons for the gains. Despite yesterday's easing by the dollar, bonds continued to draw strength from the currency's gains last week after its months-long slide, some said, as well as from the tough stance taken by Washington toward Japan in trade talks.
The strong dollar tempers fears of inflation and also make Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors.
Other market participants also attributed some gains to talk of reducing the trade deficit and to rumors that a prestigious Washington research center had predicted the Federal Reserve would ease monetary policy in July. But a number of trading desks said they had not even heard that rumor and that the Fed was more likely to raise interest rates again before it would consider lowering them.
Today the Fed will release capacity utilization and industrial production numbers for April. "Last month those numbers suggested a slowing," Mr. Dwyer, "and there is no reason to believe that they will be any different tomorrow.
"With the economy appearing to be slowing," he said, "it suggests that the Fed will no longer be in a tightening mode, and given the real rates of return, investors who find the yield on the long bond attractive, will continue to do so. People are trying to extrapolate too many fundamentals into the long bond's rally."
At the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, rates were up slightly, with the three-month maturity up 8 basis points, to 5.71 percent, and the six-month maturity up 4 basis points, to 5.69 percent.
Some tough talk between the United States and Japan includes a target list of possible trade sanctions, which could be released today, according to the trade representative's office. After publication, there will be 30 days' public comment before the list is narrowed for maximum impact in Japan and minimum impact on American interests. But 30 days also leaves time for negotiators to pull off an agreement.
In the municipal-bond market, declining yields induced issuers to consider refinancing oustanding debt, traders said. The Bond Buyer's index of 40 municipal issues dropped 3 basis points, as the average yield to maturity fell to 6.17 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
 (000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.557	97.123	Discounted Rate	5.71%	5.69%	Coupon Yield	5.89%	5.96%	High Price	98.562	97.134	Discounted Rate	5.69%	5.67%	Coupon Yield	5.87%	5.93%	Low Price	98.557	97.123	Discounted Rate	5.71%	5.69%	Coupon Yield	5.89%	5.96%	Accepted at low price	48%	39%	Total applied for	$54,084,730	$44,226,370	Accepted	$13,281,167	$13,324,298	Noncompetitive	$1,449,567	$1,304,288	
Both issues are dated May 18, 1995. The three-month bills mature on Aug. 17, 1995, and the six-month bills mature on Nov. 16, 1995.

HEADLINE: Legal System and Science Come to Differing Conclusions on Silicone

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
In the case of silicone breast implants, the courts and much of the scientific world have proceeded on strikingly unparallel tracks. While the courts have handed down multimillion-dollar awards based on the presumption of a health hazard, leading yesterday to Dow Corning's declaration of bankruptcy, the heavy-duty scientific studies now being completed have pointed to exactly the opposite conclusion, that there is no evidence that breast implants are harmful.
Part of the reason for this clash of cultures is that the legal world looks at individual cases of illness, whereas scientists hold that specially designed studies of whole populations are the only sure touchstone of truth. The cases that have convinced the courts concern women who complain of debilitating and mysterious maladies that they attribute to silicone leaking from their breast implants. Several years ago, those individual cases, typically described as "anecdotes" by scientists, prompted several epidemiological studies to be undertaken in an effort to search for statistically valid links between the implants and any disease. 
 The conclusions of seven large epidemiological studies have now been reported, with the surprising result that none have found any evidence of health effects from breast implants.
These findings have carried particular weight among scientists. "I don't know a single, high-quality immunologist who is convinced that there is a definable disease related to implants," said Dr. John Sergent, a professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University in Nashville and a former president of the American College of Rheumatology.
Health officials in other countries have also been convinced by the epidemiological studies. France allowed the implants back on the market in February and Britain's Medical Devices Agency, which never stopped the sale of the implants, concluded again in December that they were safe.
The beginning of the end for breast implants in the United States came in 1992, when Dr. David A. Kessler, the head of the Food and Drugs Administration, said his agency was calling a voluntary moratorium on their use. He said the data on record were not sufficient to show that implants were safe and he was concerned by the numbers of women who had come forward with health complaints.
Lawsuits by women claiming injury then began to snowball. Many were based on the theory that although silicone was an inert substance, it or its breakdown products nonetheless deranged the immune system, causing a variety of otherwise inexplicable maladies.
Medical experts summoned by the plaintiffs cited experiments showing that silicone could harm the immune systems of mice. Like many such experts, Dr. Nir Kossovsky, a materials scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles, who runs a testing laboratory for women with implants, said this "means that silicone can account for many of the symptoms reported by breast implant patients."
These experts have also criticized the epidemiological studies, saying that had they continued for longer or examined more women they would have found the same kind of illnesses that afflicted the plaintiffs.
But scientists who are convinced by the new epidemiological studies view the treatment of the issue in the courts as a regrettable misuse of scientific evidence. They regard the medical experts who testified for the plaintiffs as hired guns who do not represent the consensus of opinion developing in the medical field.
Dr. Shaun Ruddy of the Medical College of Virginia, the president of the American College of Rheumatology and a specialist in connective tissue diseases like those being claimed by women with implants, said that so much money was at stake that "it is very easy for people to lose their objectivity." He said he knew of academic doctors who started filling out forms for lawyers "at 1,000 bucks a pop."
"I'm tremendously bothered," said Dr. Elizabeth Connell, a professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. "I'm horrified."
Dr. Connell led a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel that concluded in 1991 that implants represented a public health need and should remain on the market while studies continued. In a second meeting, the group concluded in 1992 that there was still no evidence positively linking the implants to diseases and that a need for them remained, but it recommended that women receiving implants be followed in scientific studies.
In response to daily requests for interviews over the last week, Dr. Kessler's office repeatedly said that he was unavailable.
Dr. Bernadine Healy, a former director of the National Institutes of Health who is now director of health and science policy at the Cleveland Clinic, described the implant litigation as "an abomination for women," adding, "It's an abomination economically." She said women were the pawns and the losers in what she regarded as a trial lawyers' game. "I find it hideous," she said.
Scientists who have produced evidence or spoken against the link between implants and illness say their treatment by the plaintiffs' lawyers amounted to harassment in some cases. One of the most influential papers that criticized the supposed link between implants and disease appeared on June 14, 1994, in The New England Journal of Medicine. It was a study by Dr. Sherine E. Gabriel and her colleagues at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
The study examined the medical records of all the residents of Olmsted County, Minn., from 1964 to 1991, just before the implants were removed from the market. A long list of medical problems, including connective tissue diseases, was studied and the conclusion was that of 749 women with implants, none had excess medical problems.
Dr. Gabriel's study was accompanied by an editorial by Dr. Marcia Angell, the executive editor of the journal, noting that the courts had granted multimillion-dollar awards based on case histories that by no means showed cause and effect. Yet, she said, this misleading information "became accepted by the courts and the public as nearly incontrovertible truth."
Dr. Gabriel said that she was not naive when she published her paper, and that she knew it would infuriate lawyers for women with implants, particularly because it was financed in part by the Plastic Surgery Educational Foundation, the educational arm of the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.
But, she said, she had never taken sides on the implant issue, the study had been conceived and designed by the Mayo Clinic investigators and had been under way for several months before the group received the grant from the plastic surgeons and she did not think anyone would seriously accuse her of bias.
As soon as the paper was published, plaintiffs' lawyers said the study was tainted because of the plastic surgeons' money. Dr. Gabriel faced demands for her documents from Charles E. Houssiere, a Houston lawyer who says he represents 2,000 to 3,000 women who are suing implant manufacturers.
"The magnitude of the demands is staggering; the burden is staggering," Dr. Gabriel said. "They want over 800 manuscripts from researchers that were here, they want hundreds of data bases, dozens of file cabinets and the entire medical records of all Olmsted County women, whether or not they were in the study."
The situation has continued for a year so far, Dr. Gabriel said. "It has taken a huge amount of time and it has been extremely stressful," she said. "It has severely compromised my ability to do research."
And, she said, it has had a chilling effect on implant research generally. She said colleagues had told her that after seeing what happened to her, they would not do an implant study. "Some determined that the price in terms of their own research careers is too high to pay," she said.
Mr. Houssiere said he asked for the documents to understand how Dr. Gabriel had concluded that there was no evidence that the implants caused illnesses. "The intent was to find out the basis of her opinion," he said. And, he added, he did find some things he will use against the implant makers in court.
Dr. Angell got the same sort of treatment -- voluminous requests for documents, this time from John O'Quinn, a Houston lawyer who says that he represents 2,000 women with implants. "I was subpoenaed twice -- once in November and once last month," Dr. Angell said. Her lawyers were able to quash the first subpoena but the second is pending, she added. "They wanted a large number of documents that don't even exist, alleging contact between me and the manufacturers," she said. "They thought the manufacturers paid me."
Mr. O'Quinn said of Dr. Angell, "Why doesn't she come clean and show us the documents?"
He said: "I thought we were in the truth business, but they don't want the truth out. I'd like to get her under oath."
Investigating what it found to be baseless charges by trial lawyers against another scientist, Dr. Peter Schur of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, a committee of the American College of Rheumatology wrote: "The committee is also aware that other rheumatologists who have expressed opinions or published work viewed as contrary to the interests of plaintiffs and plaintiffs' attorneys in implant-related litigation have been subjected to various forms of harassment in the work place or even at their homes. Much of this has been attributed to plaintiffs' attorneys."
The committee added that more than $4 billion was at stake in the litigation and that the college's board should "be free of any illusions as to the agenda potentially at work in the criticism of Dr. Schur or other rheumatologists.
"It also should not underestimate the vigor with which such an agenda could be pursued, given the resources at stake."
Dr. Sergent said: "It's a sad commentary. We're such a litigious society in every way. And there are so few curbs on this sort of behavior."
 The article also misstated his relationship to a testing laboratory for women with implants. While he has a financial interest in the lab, he does not operate it.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 20, 1995, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about a clash of cultures between the courts and scientists over possible health hazards from silicone breast implants misstated an area of expertise of Dr. Nir Kossovsky of the University of California at Los Angeles. He is an associate professor of pathology who studies biomaterials, not a materials scientist.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Two medical researchers who have found no epidemiological basis for claims that silicone breast implants have adverse health effects are Dr. Elizabeth Connell, left, professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University in Atlanta (Associated Press), and Dr. Sherine E. Gabriel of the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn. Since publication of her study, Dr. Gabriel says she has been overwhelmed by requests from lawyers.

HEADLINE: Take the Lead, Mr. Clinton

BYLINE: By Matthew Miller; Matthew Miller resigned as senior adviser in the Office of Management and Budget in January.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
I left the Clinton Administration in January when the White House issued a budget that I felt turned away from its previous commitment to deficit reduction and sensible public investment.
Today, while supporting President Clinton in opposing the cruel and counterproductive Republican budget resolutions in the House and Senate, I also wonder why the White House has let the Republicans seize this issue. 
 Though the Administration is right to criticize plans that would cut spending for the most vulnerable Americans to help finance tax breaks for the well-off, it will not rally much support by hypocritically attacking cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid or by resisting the idea of balancing the budget altogether.
Last week, the White House chief of staff, Leon Panetta, said that the Republicans would "make Medicare a second-class health care system for our seniors." The Administration's 1993 economic plan, "A Vision of Change for America," struck a different note. In it, the Administration hoped to "control the growth of Medicare and Medicaid spending in the long term, and thereby supplement the deficit reduction in this economic program."
Assuming "health care controls," the plan estimated that the deficit would decline to $87 billion in the year 2003 -- from what otherwise would have been $399 billion. Bringing down the combined annual growth rate of Medicare and Medicaid was the single most important factor in the reduction.
This slower growth would have meant saving about $66 billion yearly on average over a 10-year period. The Republican Senate budget resolution, by contrast, calls for savings that average $65 billion yearly over seven years, while the House resolution calls for $69 billion yearly over the same period.
It's hard to understand how a goal the Administration considered reasonable only two years ago can seem unthinkably draconian today.
Nor is the Republicans' aim of balancing the budget by 2002 as dangerous for the economy as the Administration suggests. Mainstream economists generally agree that reducing the deficit by the equivalent of 0.5 percent of the gross domestic product per year can be reliably offset by the Federal Reserve (for example, by lowering interest rates). With the Congressional Budget Office forecasting the deficit at 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product in 1995, that would mean a five-year path to a balanced budget by 2000 would be reasonable.
In any event, it would be far better policy and better politics for Mr. Clinton to take the lead by offering his own plan to balance the budget rather than merely sniping at the Republicans.
The G.O.P. resolutions would slash basic research, investment in infrastructure and in education, while leaving untouched most of the welfare for the well-off that permeates the budget. While families struggling on $35,000 a year would continue to bear a disproportionate tax burden, for example, $30 billion in health and pension benefits would still go every year to senior citizens who have incomes above $100,000 -- giving these retirees far more back than they paid into the system.
Yet all of the Administration's well-taken criticisms will be ignored if President Clinton does not renew his commitment to addressing the problem of the deficit. The Republicans' methods may be misguided, but the goal they have embraced is the right one. Mr. Clinton should waste no time in taking back an issue he claimed as his own from his first days in office.

U.S. Sets 100% Tariffs On Japanese Luxury Cars
 The Clinton Administration placed a 100 percent tariff on 13 models of Japanese luxury cars, the largest tariff ever imposed by the United States against a trading partner. 
 Starting on Saturday, customs inspectors will double the wholesale price of every Toyota Lexus, Nissan Infiniti and several other cars that arrive from Japan. Administration officials said that the sanctions would be rescinded if the two countries could reach an accord by June 28. A1.
 Japan said it would take action to counter the U.S. tariffs by bringing the matter to the new World Trade Organization. D4.
 Toyota and Nissan said they would not pass the tariffs on to their dealers or customers at this time. Some analysts said that even if prices for Japanese luxury cars rose, buyers would switch to BMW or Mercedes, rather than Cadillac or Lincoln. D4.

HEADLINE: 2 Submarine Makers Vie for a $60 Billion Project

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
One of the fiercest naval battles in years broke out here today -- in an ornate Capitol Hill hearing room packed with admirals, lawmakers and lobbyists.
The battle pits the United States' two submarine builders in a fight that will most likely leave only one standing. At stake is a $60 billion contract to build the Navy's new attack submarine, thousands of jobs in Connecticut and Virginia and an industrial hedge against a resurgent Russia or other future enemy. 
 The Clinton Administration wants to award the contract for at least the first of the 30 new submarines without competitive bidding to the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Conn. But that tack provoked a sharp protest from Tenneco Inc.'s Newport News Shipbuilding unit, which makes submarines and aircraft carriers near Norfolk, Va., saying it can build the first five new submarines for $2 billion less than Electric Boat.
Animosity between the two submarine builders has been growing. There have been dueling studies, cost claims and counterclaims. As recently as this week, Newport News bought half-page and full-page advertisements in The Washington Post and The Washington Times. And finally, at a packed Senate Armed Services subcommittee hearing today, the rival company presidents sat side by side at the witness table sniping at senators as well as at each other.
"There are no facts anywhere to say they'll have a 40 percent savings," James E. Turner Jr., the president of Electric Boat, said of his competitor's cost estimates.
W. P. Fricks, president of Newport News, shot back: "His numbers are incorrect." His costs will be higher."
Under Republican administrations, free-market forces shaped the military industry. But President Clinton has adopted a more activist industrial policy combining economics and politics with military necessity. The Pentagon would preserve certain specialized industries that would otherwise disappear, even if there were no immediate need for their products.
A major beneficiary of the policy has been Electric Boat's Seawolf. The Administration decided to buy a third Seawolf for $2.4 billion not because of any urgent military need, but to keep welders and engineers at Groton busy until Electric Boat starts building the new attack submarine in 1998. About $900 million of the $2.4 billion has been spent, and the Navy is now asking Congress for the rest. As a consolation prize, the Pentagon agreed to build another aircraft carrier at Newport News.
But the Republican-dominated Congress takes a dim view of this Democratic President's industrial policy, especially when it ties up dwindling military dollars in New England that could be spent on ships or planes in Republican districts elsewhere.
It is a position Mr. Clinton has stuck to since the 1992 Democratic Presidential primary campaign. Former Senator Paul A. Tsongas of Massachusetts, a contender for the nomination, said it would be unrealistic to build a third Seawolf in Connecticut, and accused Mr. Clinton of pandering to the voters in the state by promising to build the submarine there. But Mr. Clinton maintained his position through the primary as well as in the general campaign against President George Bush.
Today the House and Senate are considering the cancellation of the third Seawolf and opening the new submarine business to a competition Newport News would probably win, given its greater size and lower wages. Without this work, Electric Boat says it will go out of business, leaving 6,000 employees out of work.
If the decision were based solely on cost, Newport News -- Virginia's largest private employer -- would win hands-down. The estimated savings of consolidating all submarine construction and repair work at Newport News range from $1.3 billion (the Navy's estimate) to about $10 billion (Newport News's figure).
But the Navy contends there is more than cost at stake. Nora Slatkin, who is stepping down as the Navy's acquisition chief to become the executive director at the Central Intelligence Agency, told senators that the Navy plan to keep open two "nuclear capable" shipyards preserved the option of competition in future submarine production and offered an industrial hedge if Russia or some other unforeseen naval power threatened the world's seaways.
Ms. Slatkin also said Newport News had overestimated its potential savings and understated the costs associated with closing Electric Boat and moving the work to Norfolk, which she said would delay delivery of the first new submarines by two to three years.
Both sides jumped on the free-market, open-competition bandwagon. Newport News wants competitive bidding now on the first batch of submarines, while the Navy wants to wait until Electric Boat has designed the first few vessels and the production line is large enough to support two builders. But Newport News and its Virginia supporters say the shipbuilder cannot afford to wait that long, and would have to close its submarine operations.
"This theory you're preserving two nuclear-capable shipyards sounds good, but it's phony," said Senator John W. Warner, a Virginia Republican who was Navy Secretary in the Nixon Administration.
Electric Boat's main champion, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, countered that Newport News was using its Government contracts to unfairly subsidize a bid for the new submarine work. "You're pursuing not economic competition, but economic homicide," he told Mr. Fricks of Newport News. "You're trying to kill Electric Boat, and you're asking us to pay for it."
Denying that, Mr. Fricks replied, "We're not asking for the work, just to be able to compete for it."

HEADLINE: Microsoft and NBC in Multimedia Alliance

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
The Microsoft Corporation and NBC announced an alliance yesterday to produce an array of multimedia products and services. But the details were so fuzzy that some industry analysts said the announcement was the digital-age equivalent of agreeing to be friends.
William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, and Robert C. Wright, the president of NBC, said in a conference call with reporters that the companies would jointly develop CD-ROM's, interactive television services and products for Microsoft's new on-line service, the Microsoft Network. 
 "I'm a big believer that the interactive world can be very complementary with the broadcast world," Mr. Gates said.
But unlike the MCI Communications Corporation, which recently agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation -- in part for access to its programming -- Mr. Gates said Microsoft would not pay NBC up front for access to NBC services like its coverage of the Summer Olympics or the Presidential election next year.
"None of the discussions with NBC have, in any way, involved investing in all or part of NBC," he said.
Mr. Gates and Mr. Wright would also not say how NBC and Microsoft planned to divide revenue from new CD-ROM's or services on the Microsoft Network. And Mr. Wright said the deal did not address how network personalities like Tom Brokaw would be compensated for multimedia products that draw on their talents.
All told, said George Colony, the president of Forrester Research, a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., "this is a very fancy way to say 'we're going to put our content on the Microsoft Network.' "
With digital technology opening vast but uncharted new markets, Mr. Colony said, entertainment, technology and telecommunications companies are racing to forge alliances without worrying too much about the details. "A lot of this is hedging bets," he said.
For all its fuzziness, yesterday's news had a measurable negative impact on two other commercial on-line services -- Prodigy and America Online -- that now carry material from NBC. Mr. Wright said NBC would phase out its involvement with both services, though the network would continue to maintain a site on the Internet's World Wide Web service.
America Online stock fell $3.125 to close at $38.625 on unusually heavy Nasdaq volume of almost 3.9 million shares. The stock had been down as much as $7.25 during the afternoon. Shares of Prodigy's two owners, I.B.M. and Sears, Roebuck & Company, also slipped, although only slightly.
Microsoft jumped $3.5625, to $84.875, as Wall Street reacted to the deal and to assurances by Mr. Gates that the company intended to ship Windows 95, its next generation of operating software, on schedule this August. But the deal had little effect on the shares of NBC's owner, the General Electric Company, which fell 75 cents, to $56.875.
Although the Microsoft Network does not yet have a single subscriber, industry experts say it will be an instant heavyweight among on-line services because it will be rolled out with Windows 95. Users of the new software will be able to sign on to the service at the touch of a button -- giving it a big edge over services like America Online, the largest on-line service.
Mr. Colony estimated that the Microsoft Network would sign up 2.5 million subscribers within three years, as many as America On-Line has now.
Thomas S. Rogers, the president of NBC Cable, who oversees the network's multimedia ventures, said, "When you use the reach of a broadcast network in television and the reach of Microsoft on the PC, it's a great combination."
Partly because of the lack of cash passing hands, NBC executives were quick to draw a distinction between this alliance and the one between MCI and the News Corporation. MCI paid up, they said, because it needs Mr. Murdoch's programming to fill its communications pipeline.
"We're really two companies that are in the software business," Mr. Wright said of NBC and Microsoft.
For example, he said NBC could harness Microsoft's expertise in CD-ROM's to bolster its efforts in this area. To date, NBC has produced only one CD-ROM title: a personal finance guide called "Your Portfolio." Mr. Wright said NBC would draw on Microsoft's expertise -- even borrowing the company's employees -- to create many more titles.
Some industry experts questioned the value of the alliance with Microsoft, because NBC's service will still be available to America Online and Prodigy subscribers who browse the World Wide Web. But Martin Yudkovitz, the senior vice president of NBC Multimedia, said the Web site would not include the "coolest" features of NBC's on-line offering.
The alliance also raises questions about Genie, an on-line service owned by General Electric. Mr. Wright said NBC would continue to promote its programs on Genie, which has 200,000 subscribers. But he said the Microsoft service was "a much larger undertaking" than Genie.
For his part, Mr. Gates said the Microsoft Network would be open to services from NBC's network rivals, CBS, ABC and Fox.
And he said the NBC deal would not conflict with a separate interactive partnership between Microsoft and Dreamworks, the entertainment company started by Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen.

HEADLINE: Comptroller Says Cuts May Prove Costly

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
New York City's Comptroller issued a report yesterday that said some city and state budget cuts could ultimately cost the city more money by forcing people now receiving some health or welfare benefits to turn to more expensive government services.
For example, the report concluded that a state proposal to eliminate rent supplements for welfare families, which cost the city $750 per family each year, could force more people into homeless shelters, which cost $8,486 a year. The report said that if only 1 of every 11 families getting the supplements became homeless, the city would save nothing at all. 
 In a lengthy, detailed analysis of budget proposals now being debated in Albany and at City Hall, the Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, a Democrat, said many of the proposed cuts in spending on social services would have similar unintended consequences.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani dismissed the Comptroller's study, strongly suggesting that its findings were more political than empirical. "I have to emphasize that when you start dealing with secondary and indirect analysis, it very much is guided by the predisposition of the person who does the analysis," the Mayor said at a City Hall news conference yesterday afternoon.
Although Mr. Hevesi did not take a position against specific cuts, he said that ignoring what he called "secondary impacts" would not only "inflict huge pain on people but ultimately, in many cases, cost us more money than we save."
At the same time, in response to an urgent request from Mayor Giuliani, a group of 12 business and labor leaders signed a joint letter yesterday beseeching the state government for $950 million in assistance that the city has requested, even though members could not agree how much of the aid should come at the expense of welfare and Medicaid recipients.
The letter reflected the growing concern on the part of business, labor and city government that the city will get only a fraction of its request once state leaders work out a budget. For labor, that could mean layoffs of city employees; for business, that could hurt the city's economy and mean an end to promised cuts in taxes; for City Hall, that could mean politically painful service reductions and a downgrading of the city's bonds.
If the state money is not forthcoming, the Mayor has said that his budget cuts will be even deeper, potentially leading to more unintended consequences, by Mr. Hevesi's analysis.
The Comptroller's report said Mr. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki, both Republicans, had failed to consider the impacts of their budget proposals. "Savings are not always as easy to achieve as they seem," Mr. Hevesi wrote.
The Comptroller said the combined city and state cuts in social services could drain $2.8 billion from the city's economy. In health care alone, he said, the city would save $506 million by cutting its share of Medicaid, but as a result, it would lose 30,000 to 60,000 hospital jobs and an estimated $270 million in tax revenues from the lost earnings -- assuming those people do not find new jobs in the city.
The Comptroller's findings echoed arguments made in recent weeks by other Democrats on the City Council and in the State Assembly. They came as Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders in Albany continued to fight over the state's budget, now 47 days late.
It is unclear how much of an effect the Comptroller's findings would have on budget talks in Albany that have already gone on so long. Officials in Albany have said that some of the cuts cited in the report, including home health care for the elderly and disabled, will likely to be scaled back.
The Governor's press secretary, Robert J. Bellafiore, said the report appeared to defend spending on programs "that simply are not working." He added that the city and state, each facing huge deficits, had to reduce spending somewhere.
"There is almost no choice here," he said.
The Comptroller's report did not analyze the effects of all the proposed cuts in social services, most of which would be carried out on the state level, although the Mayor has expressed support for them. Mr. Hevesi said his office studied areas facing the largest cuts, including welfare, mental health, home health care and hospitals.
Both the labor and business leaders who signed the Mayor's letter seemed to embrace the general outlines of his budget, which cuts spending by more than any budget since World War II and would reduce welfare and Medicaid spending by unprecedented levels. The letter said that the budget offers "balance, fairness, and hope," all of which, it says, would be undone if the state fails to come through with the full $950 million.
Labor leaders who signed the letter included Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37; Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, and Carl Haynes, president of Teamsters Local 237. Business leaders included David Rockefeller, Robert Tisch of Loews Corporation, the real estate executive Lewis Rudin, and the former Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman, Richard Ravitch.
Mr. Giuliani said the eventual state budget could fall hundreds of millions of dollars short of the city's needs. He said he hoped that business and labor could press their respective representatives in Albany to come through. Specifically, he said it was important that Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver understand that municipal unions would be watching him carefully to see how much cash aid he could produce for the city.
Labor leaders denied that they were being used to pressure the Speaker, and said they were simply trying to send a unified message to all the leaders in Albany. Mr. Haynes said the unions could not agree on the magnitude of welfare and Medicaid cuts proposed by the Mayor.

HEADLINE: Weak First-Quarter Profits Reported by Large Retailers

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Some of the nation's largest retailers reported disappointing first-quarter results yesterday -- an indication, many analysts said, of a continued economic slowdown.
Most retailers found that consumers, concerned about the economy, curbed their demand for clothes and home furnishings. Few analysts expect this trend to change significantly in the months ahead. "It may be a soft landing for the economy," said Daniel Barry, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, "but it's turning into a hard landing for retailers." 
 Retailers sharply discounted merchandise in the quarter to encourage sales, which were also hurt by a late Easter and higher Federal income tax bills. But these discounts led to thinner margins as retailers attempted to reduce high inventory levels.
At the J. C. Penney Company, first-quarter profits fell 30 percent, to $156 million, or 63 cents a share, from $223 million, or 88 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. At the Dayton Hudson Corporation, profits fell 72 percent, to $11 million, or 9 cents a share, from $39 million, or 48 cents a share, in the 1994 quarter.
"This is a lot more evidence of an economic slowdown," said Walter Loeb, who heads his own retail consulting firm. "We are seeing a cautious consumer who is being very careful with spending and is reacting only to sales."
Penney, based in Plano, Tex., primarily sells apparel and other "soft goods," a segment that was especially hard hit this quarter. And Dayton Hudson, based in Minneapolis, had problems at its Mervyn's division, which sells discounted clothes.
The main retailer bucking this downward trend was Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of Bentonville, Ark., the nation's largest retailer. Wal-Mart reported an 11 percent rise in earnings, to $553.4 million, or 24 cents a share, from $498.5 million, or 22 cents a share.
Home Depot Inc., a retailer specializing in home improvement products based in Atlanta, also reported higher earnings, but at a level that Wall Street found disappointing. Home Depot's earnings rose 13 percent, to $157.8 million, or 34 cents a share, from $139.8 million, or 31 cents a share. Home Depot executives attributed the poor earnings growth to severe storms and heavy rains in many parts of the country and not to the slowing economy -- an assessment shared by analysts.
David Poneman, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein, said Wal-Mart was the only retailer with a significant apparel operation that did well this quarter. He said that operating profits rose 17 percent, higher than the percentage gain in earnings per share, and that this increase came on top of record first-quarter earnings last year.
Mr. Poneman added that Wal-Mart often benefited from a sagging economy because some consumers switch from regular department stores to discounters like Wal-Mart for apparel purchases.
"You had a slowing of income growth and a reduction in consumer confidence," Mr. Poneman said. "People pick up the paper and they see various negative economic statistics. So the stores decline in a declining economy."
Most analysts predict that retailers will remain under pressure as long as the economy remains soft, which it is expected to do for the remainder of the year. But they also say the second quarter may show some improvement. Apparel sales, driven by warmer weather and a favorable consumer response to current styles, have been edging up slightly.
"The second quarter looks like it won't be as depressed as the first quarter," Mr. Barry of Merrill Lynch said. "But it doesn't mean that major retailers won't remain under pressure. Our view is that the economy will be slow all year, and retailers will be affected."

HEADLINE: Stocks Show Little Reaction To New Tensions on Trade

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The shouting match over trade between the United States and Japan may be deafening, and one of the most widely held stocks in the country may have taken a big one-day fall, but the overall stock market seemed to pay little heed yesterday.
Lower long-term interest rates and a strengthening dollar helped reverse a small drop in stock prices in the morning, and the major indexes closed mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.42 points, to 4,435.05, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.45 point, to 528.19, another record. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 5.19 points to 868.25, also a record. 
 The Clinton Administration placed a 100 percent tariff yesterday on 13 luxury car models from Japan. But the worsening trade relations had already been incorporated into the price of automobile stocks, said Edward Laux, senior managing director for institutional equity trading at the Chicago Corporation.
"It's been everywhere you look for a week already," Mr. Laux said, referring to trade tensions. "It's old news."
Shares of Ford Motor and Chrysler were unchanged, though General Motors fell 5/8, to 47 1/2. G.M. stock had risen since May 5.
Dirk van Dijk, equity strategist for C. H. Dean & Associates, which manages nearly $4 billion in stocks and bonds, said he would buy more auto stocks but would wait and see about the market as a whole.
"Trade wars, historically, are never good for markets," Mr. van Dijk said. "It would be wise to be cautious."
Shares of Pacific Telesis, the regional telephone company, suffered one of their biggest one-day falls and by far their largest plunge since March 1994, when the company spun off its cellular telephone operations.
Pacific Telesis dropped 2 5/8, to 27. After the markets closed on Monday, the company said that it "expects 1995 earnings could drop by about 10 percent," citing a combination of fewer telephone calls and lower prices ordered by California regulators. With more than 424 million shares worth nearly $11.5 billion, Pacific Telesis is one of the 15 most widely held stocks in the country.
The troubles at Pacific Telesis underscored investor uncertainties about how local telephone companies would be able to compete when local service, like long-distance service, is deregulated. All nine companies in Standard & Poor's local telephone group fell.
In the broader market, a fall in long-term interest rates helped moderate the reaction to the trade tensions. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.86 percent from 6.94 percent.
Moreover, the dollar rose against major currencies, providing more evidence for the end of the dollar's steep decline this year. The dollar rose to 86.57 Japanese yen from 86.40 yen, and to 1.4429 German marks from 1.4360.
At its lowest, on April 18, the dollar was trading below 81 yen and 1.36 marks.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal at 366.2 million shares, about 10 percent above this year's daily average of 334 million shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.26 point, to 284.27, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,401 to 912. The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.07 points, to 489.38, another record.
Among the advancing stocks was AG Associates, in its first day of trading, rising 5 1/8 from its offering price, to 16 1/8. AG makes equipment used in integrated circuits. Microsoft rose 39/16 , to 84 7/8, after the company and the NBC television network said they would develop products together for CD-ROM's and other new media.
Among the declining stocks was Crop Growers, which plunged sharply for a second day. It fell 11 5/8, to 12 5/8. The company, which provides crop insurance, reported lower-than-expected earnings. Rockefeller Center Properties, the real estate investment trust that was the mortgage lender for Rockefeller Center, resumed trading following a two-day halt after the center filed for bankruptcy protection. The trust dropped 1/2, to 4 3/4.
The most active stock, at 9.7 million shares, was Home Depot, which fell 2 1/4, to 41 1/4. The company reported lower-than-expected earnings.

HEADLINE: SANCTIONS OF JAPAN: THE OVERVIEW;
100% TARIFFS SET ON 13 TOP MODELS OF JAPANESE CARS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Living up to its threat to impose harsh sanctions on Japan, the Clinton Administration placed a 100 percent tariff today on 13 luxury car models that accounted for $5.9 billion in sales in the United States last year, including the flagship products of Toyota, Nissan and Honda.
The tariff, the largest ever imposed by the United States against any trading partner, is to go into effect at 12:01 Saturday morning. Customs inspectors will be instructed to double the wholesale price of every Toyota Lexus, Nissan Infiniti and a number of other cars that roll off Japanese transport ships -- an increase that would make the cars all but unsalable. 
 But Administration officials said the sanctions would be rescinded if Japan and the United States could reach an accord by June 28, giving the two countries six weeks to resolve a dispute that has already gone far beyond the immediate issue of the openness of Japan's market for American cars and car parts.
As the argument has broadened tremendously in recent weeks, both sides have warned that the alliance of the world's two largest economies is being badly corroded.
"We've put ourselves pretty far out on this one, and there is no backing away now," one of Mr. Clinton's top trade officials said today. "We came to the conclusion that either we draw the line here, or throw in the towel on Japan."
Japanese officials contended today that the sanctions violated international trade laws, and said that within days they would bring an action against the United States at the new and still-fragile World Trade Organization in Geneva.
In Tokyo, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Minister of International Trade and Industry, whose prospects of becoming prime minister are resting largely on his handling of the trade dispute, accused Washington of imposing "numerical targets" that Japan must meet "under the threat of unilateral actions, which is nothing but Government intervention in private business activities, and poses a serious challenge to the free trade system."
Japanese auto makers were more direct. "The U.S. Government conducts its trade policy in a coercive manner completely beyond our comprehension," said the executive vice president of the Toyota Motor Company, Masaharu Tanaka.
In private, Japanese Government officials contended that Mr. Clinton was simply playing Presidential politics, trying to shore up his support among labor unions and middle-class voters who see their jobs threatened by Japan's long reach into the American market.
But American officials say that for the first time they have found a way to hit Japan where it hurts -- and when it hurts most, with the strong yen already ravaging Japanese profits. It is unclear how long Japan's auto makers could endure the huge loss of sales that would come from a tariff that would add $20,000 to $40,000 to the cost of each car. After years of battling their way into the American luxury market, they would suddenly be surrendering it to Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Jaguar and some competitive American models.
"The U.S. is not going to stand by and watch its workers and its products unfairly treated," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, who has led the drive to be far tougher with Japan than any past administration has. Among American workers, he said, "very, very few people will be hurt."
In fact, the list Mr. Kantor announced today was more a political masterpiece than an economic one. All the cars on the list are produced in Japan, and they all make minimal use of American parts; no vehicles made at Japanese "transplants" in the United States are affected. All of the cars involved cost more than $25,000, enabling Mr. Clinton to argue that he has punished Japan without hurting middle-class American consumers. As one of Mr. Clinton's political advisers said in half-jest the other day, "So we lose the Lexus vote in Greenwich."
There are several possibilities for what could happen next. The simplest is that Japanese officials, concluding that they have misread Mr. Clinton's determination, try to patch together the minimal concessions necessary to resolve matters before the June 28 deadline. Presumably, most of the talking would take place before Mr. Clinton and Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama meet at the conference of the Group of Seven nations in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which begins on June 15. But several Administration officials warned today that they expected the two leaders' meeting to be inconclusive and said they doubted that Japan's Government would resolve internal disputes fast enough to act before the deadline.
The second possibility is that no agreement will be reached until Japanese auto makers feel enough pain to press the politicians to solve the problem.
A third -- and probably less likely -- possibility is that Japan will decide to tough it out, for fear that caving in on autos would lead to similar pressure regarding other industries. Japanese officials could calculate that such a move would ultimately cost them less and would give them a chance to argue that the sanctions are a violation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Many American experts on trade law say Japan could win such an argument, although Mr. Kantor insists that the United States is within its rights to act unilaterally against Japanese imports. He contends that Section 301 of the Trade Act grants broad powers to retaliate after concluding that a trading partner is discriminating against American imports. Still, he may not want to test that proposition before a neutral panel in Geneva.
Today the Director General of the World Trade Organization, Renato Ruggiero, made what some trade experts saw as a veiled warning to the United States. Mr. Ruggiero, whose appointment the United States opposed for more than a year before reluctantly endorsing him, said, "I expect both parties to abide by the W.T.O. rules and procedures, which they know well."
In public the Administration has maintained a solid front on the trade issue, trying to send Japan the message that it must make progress on the economic issues if it wants to make sure there is no damage to the political ties, and ultimately the security ties, between the countries. But several Administration officials say there are signs of growing internal tension over the issue. Mr. Kantor has called for a full-court press, several White House officials say, while Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the new head of the National Economic Council, has been trying to temper the public oratory to prevent an already nasty argument from getting uglier.

HEADLINE: Harry Bergold, Ex-Envoy to Nicaragua, Dies at 63

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

 BODY:
Harry E. Bergold Jr., an official and diplomat who provided information to journalists that led to the discovery that American Government funds were being sent illegally to anti-Sandinista fighters in Nicaragua, died yesterday at his home in Paris. He was 63.
He had been suffering from cancer, said his wife, Karlene G. Knieps, a Foreign Service officer. 
 Mr. Bergold served as Ambassador to Hungary and Nicaragua before his career was cut short by conservatives in the Senate.
After returning from his post in Nicaragua in 1987 and spending a year in Washington, Mr. Bergold was nominated by President Reagan to become Ambassador to Morocco. But Senator Jesse Helms and several of his allies, who believed that Mr. Bergold had not been sufficiently tough on the leftist Sandinistas during his tenure in Managua, objected to his nomination and managed to defeat it.
Mr. Bergold retired from the Foreign Service in 1989 and moved to Vienna, where he was a visiting lecturer at the Institute for European Studies.
When his wife was named to a post at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris in 1993, they moved there.
Mr. Bergold combined an encyclopedic knowledge of history with a laconic wit that won him friends in political circles throughout Europe and Latin America. While in Hungary, he advised Communist leaders on ways to loosen their ties to the Soviet Union. In Nicaragua, he developed a close relationship with the hard-line but intellectually restless Interior Minister, Tomas Borge, who often visited him for late-night conversations over cognac and cigars.
Opposition figures were welcome guests at Mr. Bergold's residences in Budapest and Managua, but he kept his contacts with them unobtrusive for fear that they might be denounced as puppets of the United States.
Mr. Bergold was considered a specialist in European affairs, and President Reagan's decision to send him to Nicaragua, at the suggestion of Secretary of State George P. Shultz, was surprising. Mr. Shultz explained that he wanted an ambassador in Nicaragua who had dealt with Communist governments.
Although he professed never to have developed a deep interest in Latin America, Mr. Bergold found that his post in Managua put him in the vortex of a political firestorm. He came to disagree with the view that the Sandinista Government represented a serious threat to United States security, and he angered conservatives in Washington by refusing to assume a militantly anti-Sandinista posture.
Mr. Bergold harbored serious misgivings about the wisdom of the war against the Sandinistas, which the Reagan Administration sponsored, and he repeatedly asked Washington for permission to open serious negotiations with Sandinista leaders. In the charged climate of the mid-1980's, however, he was not permitted to do so.
He headed a United States negotiating team that met with Sandinista delegates several times in Mexico City, but was under strict instructions from Washington not to allow the talks to expand into serious bargaining over important issues.
Later he provided information that led to discovery of an operation in which Lieut. Col. Oliver North, a National Security Council aide, was sending Government money to anti-Sandinista fighters at a time when such financing was prohibited by law. Supporters of Colonel North suspected the involvement of Mr. Bergold and took their revenge by scuttling his nomination as Ambassador to Morocco.
Although Mr. Bergold served in Nicaragua when Sandinista power was at its peak, he never doubted that the Government was headed for collapse.
He hung a large map of the Austro-Hungarian empire in his office in Managua, and when asked why, he replied, "To remind me that things change."
Mr. Bergold was born Nov. 11, 1931, in Olean, N.Y. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale in 1953, served in the Army, and then returned to Yale to earn a Master of Arts degree in 1957. He joined the Foreign Service that year, serving in Honduras, Mexico, Madrid and Panama before being called to Washington.
From 1973 to 1977 Mr. Bergold served in the Defense Department, first as Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and NATO affairs and later as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs. He was detailed to the White House in 1977 to help draft plans for the new Department of Energy. Later that year, he was named Assistant Secretary of Energy for International Affairs, a post he held until 1979.
He was Ambassador to Hungary from 1980 to 1983, and Ambassador to Nicaragua from 1984 to 1987. During the 1987-88 academic year he was a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, and in 1988-89 he was a visiting professor of eastern European history at George Washington University.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Bergold is survived by a stepdaughter from a previous marriage, Celeste Bergold, a State Department employee who lives in Virginia.
A memorial service will be held Friday at 11 A.M. at the Eglise St. Clotilde in Paris.

HEADLINE: SANCTIONS OF JAPAN: THE IMPLICATIONS
100% TARIFFS SET ON 13 TOP MODELS OF JAPANESE CARS;
Trading War: No Way Out?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Once again Washington is playing hardball with Tokyo, imposing punitive tariffs against imports unless Japan yields in trade negotiations. But unlike previous confrontations, in which Japan invariably offered 11th-hour concessions to avoid a blowup, this conflict has created a gnawing fear among many economists that a weak Japanese Government will let the crisis escalate out of control.
"I think the Japanese have had it with threats from America," said William R. Cline, an economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "I think they won't budge." 
 But in some important ways, it almost doesn't matter what Tokyo does. For whatever happens in the end, many economists say, Americans are unlikely to notice any of the pocketbook benefits they might anticipate. And they may well end up paying an unexpectedly heavy price in damage to a global order that serves America's long-term interests well.
"We usually get something when we play brinksmanship with Japan," said Van Doorn Ooms, director of research for the Committee on Economic Development, a New York public policy organization sponsored by a number of prominent American businesses. But, he added, "Confrontation is a very risky -- and very unfortunate -- policy."
Washington and Tokyo have a long history of coerced agreements intended to protect American industry from Japanese competition or to promote access by United States producers to the sheltered Japanese market. But the record of those past deals is at best mixed and at worst a dismal failure.
In one sense, the "voluntary" restraints that set quotas on the Japanese share of the American auto market in the early 1980's "worked." They protected Detroit from devastating competition when American auto makers had no high-quality, fuel-efficient models to sell to compete against Japanese cars.
But they also added billions of dollars to the cost of cars in America. And a good chunk of that cash went into the coffers of the Japanese auto makers, which chalked up big profits on each sale because the supply of sought-after imports was so limited. Perversely, that created an even worse threat by encouraging Japanese producers to enter the market for high-margin luxury cars -- Detroit's bread and butter. That's because the quotas were set in terms of the number of vehicles sold rather than their overall value.
Probably the most important agreement hammered out under the threat of sanctions was the 1986 pact on semiconductors, guaranteeing markets for American computer chips in Japan and in other nations where Japanese and United States chip makers competed. In a book written two years ago, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, now director of President Clinton's National Economic Council, conceded that "the conventional wisdom among economists is that the agreement was an unmitigated failure."
But she challenged that view, arguing that "a more nuanced conclusion" would measure the pact as "a qualified success" because it stabilized America's share of the world market and may have laid the groundwork for the resurgence of Silicon Valley.
More broadly, some experts question the conventional wisdom of most economists about dealing with Japan. "It's clear that a big piece of our trade deficit with Japan is structural," said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute and a former trade negotiator in the Reagan Administration. "The dollar has gone from 260 yen to 80 yen but we don't sell any more paper, glass, auto parts, soda ash, you name it. That indicates that the assumptions of free market economics aren't at work."
But economists reply that the get-tough approaches haven't worked any better. Negotiating under the gun produced the Bush Administration's so-called Structural Impediments Initiative, yet another muddled milestone in the love-hate relationship between Washington and Tokyo. Ironically, that effort, which was aimed at getting at the root of the problem by overcoming barriers that make consumer goods particularly expensive in Japan, was initially applauded by most economists as an attempt to mesh the two economies more closely.
But in practice, noted Paul R. Krugman, a leading trade economist at Stanford University, the effort was soon informally dubbed the "simply insulting initiative."
What is clear from straightforward economic analysis is that all these efforts to reduce trade barriers have done little to overcome the problem as most people define it: Japan's huge trade surplus and America's gaping trade deficit.
Here's how economists explain the complex causes and effects at work.
"If America barred all imports of Japanese autos, the bilateral imbalance of trade with Japan would decline," said Gary R. Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan. But the overall trade balance of the United States with the rest of the world would not narrow unless Americans decided to save more or invest less.
Why? Cars not imported from Japan instead might be imported from, say, Germany or Canada. And if some Americans switched to domestic models, the increased demand would soon show up as limitations on the capacity to produce other sorts of goods at home. One way or another, argues Peter B. Kenen, an economist at Princeton University, "the trade balance is driven by macroeconomic policies" that play a much bigger role in determining how much of the nation's overall demand will be satisfied by imports than any specific trade barriers.
But critics argue that the standard economic argument ignores the message the United States sends to the rest of the world if it turns a blind eye to Japanese trade barriers.
"What the Clinton Administration is really challenging," said Mr. Prestowitz, the former trade negotiator, "is a whole web of practices, business relationships and government policies that many other Asian countries have adopted. They're really challenging how this game is going to be played in the future."
Still, pressuring Japan to set specific targets for auto parts imports sends the wrong signal, argues Mr. Cline of the Institute for International Economics. It will undermine America's decade-old effort to reduce government interference in domestic Japanese markets. "We're encouraging regulation," he says.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Sensing a need to polish its image, the World Bank gets ready for its first campaign.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE World Bank, for the first time since its founding in 1945, is becoming an advertiser.
But don't look for commercials promising toasters to the first 50 developing nations that open accounts at the bank's office in Washington. Rather, bank executives want to begin running sometime this fall a campaign that would serve as the equivalent of corporate image advertising. In the meantime, a series of print advertisements answering the critics of the bank is appearing this week in newspapers. 
 The campaign later this year has the ambitious goal of burnishing the image of the bank at a critical point in its history, and improving perceptions about its policies among so-called decision makers and opinion leaders.
The bank is scrambling to shift its focus as it comes under fire from environmentalists skeptical of large-scale development projects in the third world and from politicians eager to slash public spending. There is even a coalition of advocacy groups agitating under the banner "50 Years Is Enough," hoping to deliver the bank from what they deem a lengthy midlife crisis.
"This is a major, major departure on all sorts of fronts," said Mark Malloch Brown, who joined the World Bank in September in the new position of external affairs director. "For many years the bank has been trapped in this 'development club,' talking just to economists and nongovernmental organizations.
"Now we need a message that mainstreams the bank and makes it relevant again to where the world is going."
The idea of advertising predates the bank's pending change in top leadership, Mr. Malloch Brown said; James D. Wolfensohn is scheduled to become president on June 1, succeeding the late Lewis T. Preston.
As Mr. Malloch Brown begins a review on the account, he hopes to obtain a budget commensurate with a campaign "trying to create a global corporate image" for the likes of an investment banking firm, which runs in the range of $3 million to $5 million. With the help of Herb Schmertz, the corporate communications strategist best known for his work for the Mobil Corporation, Mr. Malloch Brown has drawn up an eclectic list of agencies expected to make presentations next month:
*Bartle Bogle Hegarty, the hot creative shop in London that handles accounts for giant marketers like Coca-Cola and Levi Strauss.
*Margeotes Fertitta Donaher & Weiss in New York, which specializes in campaigns for premium-priced products like Stolichnaya vodka, as well as image campaigns for corporations like the McGraw-Hill Companies.
*Shepardson Stern & Kaminsky in New York, founded by former executives of the Sawyer Miller strategic communications agency, now part of Robinson Lake Sawyer Miller, a unit of Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt. Shepardson Stern works for clients like Time Warner Cable; Mr. Malloch Brown was a top executive of Sawyer Miller from 1986 to 1994.
*Young & Rubicam Business Communications in Geneva, a unit of Young & Rubicam Inc. specializing in what Mr. Malloch Brown called "corporate positioning advertising" for accounts like the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; Mr. Malloch Brown was a staff member of that office from 1979 to 1983.
"There are a lot of valid points indeed about the bank being in a midlife crisis in terms of operating effectiveness," Mr. Malloch Brown said. "The bank needs to hear its clients better."
At the same time, he added, "we've allowed those critics to set the terms of the debate and let our operating failings be the sole standard by which we are judged."
"We want to convey that we've heard these criticisms and are responding to them and improving ourselves," he said.
Those are, of course, reasons for corporate image advertising, for which American companies spent an estimated $1.5 billion last year.
Indeed, Mr. Malloch Brown said, "the most important thrust of the advertising" will be to stress the bank's recognition that its "challenge is to serve its government masters while striking a partnership with the private sector, being a strategic bridge to channeling money to developing countries in ways that make them grow."
One element of the campaign, he added, will be to emphasize that 75 percent of the bank's estimated $22 billion in annual lending "is raised on world capital markets," rather than from governments.
In a prelude to the campaign, the ads this week, running in newspapers in New York and Washington, offer examples of American companies obtaining lucrative contracts from nations receiving loans from the bank. They urge members of Congress not to reduce financing for the bank's International Development Association unit, which provides loans to very poor countries.
The ads, which carry the theme "The World Bank. A good investment," respond to proposals in the Senate and House Budget Committees that the United States halve or eliminate its contribution to the development unit. They were created by Greer, Margolis, Mitchell, Burns, the Washington political and issues consulting company, and by Michael Deaver, senior vice president at the Washington office of Edelman Public Relations Worldwide.

HEADLINE: Added Slowdown Evidence: Industry and Home Building

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
More signs of an abrupt economic slowdown emerged today as industry operated at a markedly lower pace in April while home building failed to rebound from a poor winter, Government statistics showed.
The bond market greeted the figures as further evidence that economic growth was slowing to a more moderate pace with low inflation. Bond prices surged and interest rates fell sharply. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond hit its lowest point since March of last year, dropping to 6.86 percent, from 6.94 percent on Monday. [Page D6.] 
 Still, economists said that today's reports indicated that the economy might be coming down harder than the hoped-for "soft landing," but they saw little risk of recession.
Robert R. Davis, chief economist for America's Community Bankers, a trade group, predicted that the economy would expand by a rate of less than 2 percent in coming months, a pace not lively enough to prevent unemployment from rising. But he and most other analysts said it was unlikely that business activity would actually contract rather than grow at a slow pace.
"The economy looks fundamentally sound," said Mark P. Vitner, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C. He found the main problem to be a temporary buildup of inventories, including new homes, which he said would likely correct itself without any need for the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy.
According to the Federal Reserve, the nation's factories, mines and utilities operated at 84.1 percent of capacity in April, the third straight decline, well below the revised March pace of 84.7. Production fell to the lowest level in nine months, with April's decline bringing the first back-to-back shrinkages in nearly three and a half years.
Separately, the Commerce Department reported that builders broke ground on new homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,236,000, a negligible four-tenths of 1 percent higher than in March. The Northeast was by far the weakest region, with both the biggest drop and the lowest pace of construction. Housing starts there tumbled 22.5 percent, to an annual pace of 107,000, far below the April 1994 pace of 150,000 dwellings.
Addressing directors of the National Association of Realtors here this morning, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, emphasized what he called the central bank's commitment to providing "a stable platform" for business, including real estate, an industry periodically battered by Government anti-inflation measures.
"I can assure you that it is not a goal of monetary policy to encourage fluctuations in interest rates," Mr. Greenspan told the realtors in what some analysts, mindful of a Fed meeting next Tuesday to review policy, took as a hint that supported their expectations of no change in short-term rates.
More than half the slump of four-tenths of 1 percent in industrial output last month was accounted for by motor vehicles and parts but production also fell for furniture, appliances, food, clothing, gasoline and even -- for the first time in almost three years -- business equipment.
Output fell three-tenths of 1 percent in March and was unchanged, upon revision, in February.
For factories, which account for 87.1 percent of industrial output, the decline was five-tenths of 1 percent last month, the largest of three straight contractions. Motor vehicle assemblies were at a 12.1 million annual rate, down from 12.8 million in March, with cars accounting for the entire decline.
Mining output rose two-tenths of 1 percent while utilities produced 1.6 percent more energy after a 2.4 percent March drop.
By market groups, production of consumer goods fell an additional five-tenths of 1 percent, to a level just 1.6 percent above that of April 1994 while business equipment fell four-tenths of 1 percent, construction supplies fell 1.5 percent and business supplies fell two-tenths of 1 percent.
The operating rate for industry, which was revised a bit lower for January, February and March, eased to 84.1 percent in April, meaningfully below the 85.5 percent peak now posted for December and January. While not predicting a cut in interest rates, Mr. Vitner, the bank economist, observed that the Fed "never cuts rates" until the industry capacity rate retreats.
Besides the skid in home construction in the Northeast, the housing report showed virtually no change in the Midwest and gains of nearly 3 percent and 9 percent, respectively, in the South and West.
Permits for future construction edged up five-tenths of 1 percent, with the West strongest, the South and Midwest somewhat weaker and the Northeast about unchanged at a rate of 127,000.
Shipments of mobile homes, which are reported with a lag, were at an annual rate of 333,000 in March, 2,000 fewer than in February, the Commerce Department found. Actual March shipments, with no seasonal adjustment, totaled 29,200.

HEADLINE: Class Notes;
Why employers aren't interested in the high school grades of prospective workers.

BYLINE: By Peter Applebome 

 BODY:
Researchers studying the hiring practices of American businesses have been alarmed at the lack of connection between schools and businesses, particularly the way in which employers seem to pay no attention to the grades and performance of high school students.
The concern is that if employers do not care, why should students. 
 But experts say there are two good reasons why employers almost never look at students' grades: They often cannot get them, and they are afraid they might get sued if they do.
Both reasons are lessons in the ways that reality complicates theory in education.
School-to-work transitions have been a major concern long before the Clinton Administration made the issue a cornerstone of its education policy through various programs intended to match the needs of employers better with the curriculum of the schools. The idea is not that schools should be judged only as producers of potential workers. It is that other countries, particularly Japan, do a much better job of matching those needs than the United States.
Among the issues is the degree to which employers disregard schools and look to other sources, particularly other work experience, when hiring. A survey of American employers by the Census Bureau, released in February, found that in assessing job applicants, employers looked to nearly every other attributes -- attitude, communication skills, recommendations from current employees or previous employers -- before they looked to the schools.
Almost everyone agrees that this sends the wrong signal.
"We've sent students the message that it's important to graduate, but not that it's better to graduate with B's than D's," said David Crawford, who teaches economics at the University of Pennsylvania. "If students aren't achieving, one reason for that is that they don't have an incentive to achieve."
One remedy is to have employers make it their business to use student achievement in sorting out job applicants. It would make sense for the schools, and, it turns out, studies of employers like the Lockheed Corporation have shown that high school records are excellent predictors of success in the workplace.
So why don't employers use them? Part of the reason is that many, particularly the more desirable employers, are so skeptical of the schools and of young people that they want someone else to hire and train them before they are willing to do so.
But more practical considerations also get in the way. One is legal.
In the landmark Griggs v. Duke Power decision, the Supreme Court in 1971 ruled that employers were prohibited not just from overt discrimination but also from practices that "are fair in form but discriminatory in operation." In that case, the Duke Power Company of North Carolina required high school diplomas for low-level jobs. That barred relatively few white applicants but many blacks. The Supreme Court found that a form of discrimination, and the result was a scramble by businesses to remove practices that had what the Court had called "disparate impacts" on minorities.
Many companies view the case as an indicator that they could be slapped with a lawsuit if they demand educational credentials that do not have a direct impact on the skills required for a job.
The other reason for not using transcripts more is practical.
High schools view transcripts as tools for colleges, not for employers. And employers and labor experts say that when companies request information from schools, it often takes too long to arrive and comes in a form they cannot readily decipher.
John Bishop of the Center for Advanced Human Resource Studies at Cornell University cited a case in which an insurance company in Columbus, Ohio, sent out 1,200 requests for information from transcripts and got only 92 responses. By asking for information, rather than the transcript itself, the company asked for additional work and thus reduced the response, Mr. Bishop said.
There are efforts to change things. The Educational Testing Service has developed a program, Work Link, that electronically provides information to employers. But since it requires active participation by students and electronic capability by employers, Mr. Bishop is doubtful that it will gain a broad-enough constituency to be useful.
A simpler and, he thinks, more promising experiment called Hire Education is under way in Delaware. When business leaders surveyed schools to find out how often they were asked for transcripts, they found that it rarely happened.
Under the new program put together by Delaware business groups, three companies, Bell Atlantic, Citicorp and PPG Industries, have bought fax machines for every high school in the state and have worked out a streamlined process of legally getting transcripts to employers.
As part of the program, schools are expected to raise awareness among students that employers will look at school records, and businesses are encouraged to recruit in schools and look at transcripts.
"You want a system that's simple and that includes everyone, not something that can be dismissed as a place to look for lemons," Mr. Bishop said.

HEADLINE: Abortions Up Slightly for Welfare Mothers

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 16

 BODY:
Abortions among New Jersey mothers on welfare increased slightly after the state began cutting off benefits for additional children born to mothers on welfare, figures released today showed. The revelations were deplored by foes of abortion, who have argued from the start that caps on welfare benefits would promote abortion, as well as by abortion rights advocates, who condemn the law for reducing welfare mothers' economic choices.
The study by the Department of Human Services showed that the rate of abortions per 1,000 women on welfare in the state increased from 9.43 to 9.78 in the eight months preceding and following the imposition of the new restrictions, known as the family cap, in August 1994. 
 Extrapolated, the increase amounted to an increase of about 300 abortions, said William Waldman, the Human Services Commissioner.
The study of abortions by welfare mothers was undertaken by the Department of Human Services after evidence surfaced that the size of welfare families had begun to decline after the imposition of the cap under Gov. Jim Florio. Mr. Florio promoted the change as a deterrent to additional children by welfare mothers.
Mr. Waldman took pains to argue that abortion rates fluctuate over time, and that it was too early to conclude that the family cap law was responsible for the apparent increase in abortions, which were paid for under Medicaid.
But anti-abortion groups pointed out that abortion rates have generally been falling in New Jersey, as they have nationally. A reversal of that trend among welfare mothers immediately after the imposition of the cap was proof that New Jersey's state law was promoting abortion, said Representative Christopher H. Smith, the New Jersey Republican who led the fight against the adoption of a similar cap in the recently passed House welfare reform act.
"It's very, very sad, but it's also predictable," Representative Smith said in response to the study. "If you take away funding for the poorest of our children and pay for abortions on demand through Medicaid, like New Jersey and New York and many other states do, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to conclude that you are either going to have poorer children or dead children."
It is a measure of the tangled logic of the abortion debate that Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League in Washington, also condemned the family cap, but with a focus on the issue of choice rather than abortion.
"We are opposed to the family cap because we believe it will result in women being forced to choose an abortion that they may not want because they cannot see a way to support that child if it is born," Ms. Michelman said.
New Jersey's cap law was recently upheld by a United States District Court judge, Nicholas H. Politan. Both Ms. Michelman's group and the New Jersey Right to Life Committee have signed a friend-of-the-court brief opposing the law on the appeal.
"We are against coercing women into decisions like this," Ms. Michelman added, drawing a distinction between her group's stand and that of anti-abortion groups. "They're against the abortion."
New Jersey's family cap was "the buzz word all over Washington" during the debate over the Republican-sponsored welfare reform bill, Representative Smith said, and his efforts to remove the cap from the House version were unavailing.
But Marie Tasy, head of New Jersey Right to Life, said today that her members would lobby the Senate, which has yet to take up the measure, with today's statistics from New Jersey.
"We hope that they will look at what has happened in New Jersey under this law," Ms. Tasy said, "because after today, no one can say that this law does not encourage abortion."

HEADLINE: Gypsum Accepts Sweetened Bid Of $1.2 Billion

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The National Gypsum Company, the nation's second-largest maker of gypsum-coated wallboard, said yesterday that it had accepted a sweetened $1.2 billion takeover offer from Delcor Inc., a private investment company led by National Gypsum's former chairman.
The agreement, which must be ratified by shareholders, also permits National Gypsum to solicit competing bids through the end of June. But in the wake of Delcor's new offer of $54 a share, two big European companies previously seen as potential buyers said they were no longer interested. Delcor has been pursuing National Gypsum since November. 
 "The transaction represents an excellent opportunity for the company's shareholders to realize the value of their stock while preserving the company's ability to identify and obtain the benefit of any superior transactions that may be available," Steve Humphrey, National Gypsum's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement issued yesterday.
Late last year some Wall Street analysts said the company, which had revenues of $630.5 million and earnings of $83 million in 1994, could fetch as much as $60 to $65 a share.
Yesterday's offer of $54 is in the ballpark, the analysts said, but only barely.
"Because of the decline in interest rates that has occurred since November, the $54-a-share offer could be considered at the lower end of what could be considered fair valuation for the company," said Ivy Schneider, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.
Based on the movement in National Gypsum's shares yesterday, investors and speculators do not seem to think the bidding will go any higher. National Gypsum shares closed at $51.875 yesterday in Nasdaq trading, up $2.125 a share.
Smith Barney Inc., financial adviser to a committee that National Gypsum formed to consider offers, said that the $54 offer was fair to the company's stockholders.
Delcor is controlled by C. D. Spangler Jr., who until earlier this year was the chairman of National Gypsum and is the company's largest single shareholder, with a 20 percent stake worth around $209 million. Delcor is a subsidiary of Golden Eagle Industries.
Joining Delcor in the deal are two North Carolina-based regional banking giants, the Nationsbank Corporation and First Union Bancorp, institutions that are normally fierce rivals.
Under the proposed terms of the transaction, Delcor and its partners will form a company to acquire National Gypsum and take the company private for the second time. National Gypsum went private in a $2 billion leveraged buyout by Aancor Holdings Inc. in 1986 to avoid a hostile takeover by the Wickes Companies.
Delcor and First Union, which owns about 4 percent of National Gypsum's stock, a stake worth about $42 million, will contribute their shares to the newly formed acquistion company. Nationsbank will contribute an additional $42 million in cash to buy equity.
With a net worth recently estimated at more than $800 million, Mr. Spangler is reputed to be North Carolina's wealthiest resident. Mr. Spengler was not available for comment yesterday.
National Gypsum, which emerged from bankruptcy protection in June, 1993 at $12.50 a share, is based in Charlotte, N.C.
In addition to its investment in National Gypsum, Delcor is one of the largest shareholders in RJR Nabisco and Nationsbank.
The $54 offer is the third Delcor has made for National Gypsum since November.
Its initial offer of $43.50 a share, or $940 million, was rejected as inadequate in December. In February, Delcor made a $600 million recapitalization offer for the company, an offer that included $34.50 in cash for each share plus a one-quarter share of the recapitalized company.
That offer was followed on Feb. 28 by a $1.12 billion, $48.50-a-share bid from BPB Industries P.L.C., a British company that is Europe's largest wallboard manufacturer.
National Gypsum rejected that offer three days later, but added it would consider a higher offer.
With a market capitalization of $2.5 billion, a healthy cash flow and little debt, BPB was seen as having the resources to raise its bid.
Lafarge-Coppee, a Paris-based wallboard maker that owns a 10 percent stake in National Gypsum, was also seen as a potential bidder.
But both companies said they were dropping out yesterday. Given the comparatively low cost of Delcor's current holdings in National Gypsum, buying all of the company's shares outstanding at a price of more than $54 a share was apparently seen as prohibitively high.

HEADLINE: Energy Commission Gives Utilities Freer Trade in Low-Cost Power

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
The Federal agency that oversees the nation's utility industry issued two orders yesterday aimed at widening access to the transmission system and making it easier for utilities and independent producers with surplus, low-cost power to sell it to other utilities.
Whether the savings will be passed on to consumers was not clear. The decisions by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission were another step in forcing the industry to allow more economical and freer trading of power. 
 Jeanine Hull, the president of the Electric Generation Association, an independent power trade group, said the decisions "will make it more likely that the person who has the lowest-cost power can get it to the end user."
As utilities get ready for more competition, those with low-cost excess power have been pushing for greater access to the tranmission systems, which are generally controlled by local utilities.
Utilities with high costs have often made it difficult for competitors to transmit power over their grids because they want to protect the viability of their own generating plants. The commision, however, struck a blow at such utilities yesterday.
In the past, the high-cost utilities have formed pools to transmit their own power and have been reluctant to allow outsiders to sell low- cost power over their systems. In the first action of its kind, the agency directed that all the members of a power pool provide more equitable transmission service to an outside utility.
The commission gave the 11 members of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Power pool 70 days to negotiate rates, terms and conditions for providing the Duquesne Light Company access to the pool's system.
The commission said the members should charge rates that are comparable to those they charge themselves for similar transmission service.
In a second order, the commission greatly encouraged regions to form regional transmission groups. Under such groups a large number of utilities, independent power producers and state agencies join to provide more equitable and easier access to power lines in an area covering many states.
The commission approved the first such group yesterday with the Western Regional Transmission Association, which has 40 members in a large area in the West.
A major goal of such groups, the commission said, was to move decision-making from Washington to the regions. The commission said it would defer to decisions made by such groups.
In March, the commission approved a sweeping proposal that would force utilities to open their transmission systems to competitors.
Under the proposal, which the commission is expected to carry out later this year, 137 investor-owned utiities would have to allow outside access to their transmission grids on the same basis that they use their grids.
Utilities would have to file prices for transmission service with the commission and disclose their transmission costs.
Yesterday's orders were seen as a further indication that the comission was determined to break down the barriers that block power sales among different producers.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Threatened Japan Car Tariffs Bring Broad Gains for the Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened against most leading currencies yesterday as expectations grew that the Clinton Administration's plan to impose punitive tariffs on 13 Japanese luxury car models would help cut the American trade deficit with Japan.
"The sanctions are being perceived as positive for the dollar," said Earl Johnson, at the Bank of Montreal/Harris Bank in Chicago. "Either the U.S. puts the sanctions on and that shrinks the deficit, or Japan makes concessions and that cuts the deficit." 
 Many analysts view the trade gap with Japan as the most important reason for the dollar's 13 percent fall against the yen this year. It leaves Japanese exporters with a steady supply of dollars to sell for yen when bringing their profits home.
The dollar rallied in European trading before the sanctions announcement. It also drew support from comments by two officials of Germany's central bank, who joined a chorus of specialists hinting at lower interest rates there. Lower German rates could help the dollar by making mark-denominated deposits less attractive.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar settled at 86.57 Japanese yen, up from 86.40 yen late Monday. It rose to 1.4429 German marks from 1.4360 marks.
The dollar also strengthened against the French franc, rising to 5.1033 francs from 5.0325. It rose against the Swiss franc, to 1.2069 francs from 1.1988 on Monday. The Mexican peso strengthened to 5.925 to the dollar from 5.9300.
The dollar has gained 5.5 percent against the mark and 4 percent against the yen since May 8. It rose in European trading yesterday after a member of the Bundesbank Council, Olaf Sievert, said German interest rates were "on the high side." Another central banker, Edgar Meister, said the bank was keeping its options open on rates.

Treasuries Surge on Signs Of Slowdown

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose sharply yesterday as the market continued to rally on more data showing fresh signs of an economic slowdown.
Reports showing a decline in industrial production in April and weak growth in housing fueled the rally yesterday. 
 "We are in a soft landing," said Jane Tedder, vice president and senior portfolio manager at the Security Management Company. "But I wouldn't be surprised to see rates bump up a little, just because I believe the market is a little oversold."
The price of the 30-year bond surged 14/32 , to 10921/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.86 percent, from 6.94 percent on Monday, the lowest since 6.84 percent on March 22, 1994. Two-year note yields fell five basis points, to 6.08 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Rates for shorter-maturity bills were also lower, but not as much as those for the longest maturities.
Dealers said the rally yesterday was hindered by rumors of central banks in Europe and Asia that were supposedly selling Treasury securities. But traders said there was no way to confirm the sales.
"Those rumors have been around the market since last week," said Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist for the CS First Boston Corporation in New York. "We basically inherited today's lofty levels from overnight trading."
The announcement of trade sanctions against Japanese imports had little effect on the market, as did comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. Speaking before the National Association of Realtors, Mr. Greenspan said, "It is not a goal of monetary policy to encourage fluctuations in interest rates."
The rally picked up pace after the Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose four-tenths of 1 percent in April, a weak rebound from a poor winter. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News had expected housing starts would rise 9.1 percent.
Rusty Vanneman, a senior market analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said the housing starts report drove the market. "Even though the number was an improvement over the prior three months," he said, "the fact is it came in at a lower-than-expected rate, which showed that economy was still growing, but at a sluggish rate."
In addition, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production slumped four-tenths of 1 percent. April capacity utilization use fell to 84.1 percent, the lowest in nine months.
Ms. Tedder of Security Management noted that the industrial production showed weakness in durable goods. "What that says is that people are spending less on large-ticket items and these signs bode well for the market going forward," she said.
"Although we've seen yields come down, we do think inflation is well enough under control according to signs in that economy," she added. " We could see the yield on the long bond down to about 6.50 percent by now and the end of the year."
Mr. Vanneman of Technical Data said: "Today the fundamental data support the bullish camp. But the bears kept the market from extending through last week's highs."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Fighting Piracy and Frustration in China;
Counterfeit Goods Flourish in a Legal System That Is Often Outwitted

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, May 16

 BODY:
Pu Xinghua, a plump man given to nervous giggling, leaned back in the witness box as he was asked whether the factory he manages had illegally copied compact disks, several of which were displayed before him in the courtroom.
"It's been a long time," Mr. Pu said, trying to suppress a laugh. "Maybe we made some like this, but I don't remember." 
 The chief judge, Yang Jun, raised an eyebrow. Lawyers said later that under an agreement that had been worked out before the court session, Mr. Pu was supposed to admit wrongdoing in exchange for avoiding further prosecution. Now Mr. Pu was apparently thumbing his nose at the agreement.
For the foreign plaintiff, an association of music companies from the United States and elsewhere, Mr. Pu's testimony in Shanghai Intermediate Court one recent morning was a sign that on top of all the many other frustrations in navigating China's evolving legal system the court was now unable to enforce its own decisions.
Only recently has it even become possible for a foreign company in China to take a local defendant to court and win. More than half the battle is simply getting into a courtroom, where proceedings are generally scripted to validate a decision that has already been made.
But if Chinese courts are inching toward greater fairness in disputes involving foreign companies, they are also becoming less able to control Chinese defendants. Fast-paced economic growth and receding regulation are making Chinese companies less accountable and harder to prosecute.
In the Shanghai case, the factory evaded any attempt at tough prosecution because Mr. Pu and other managers agreed to admit guilt, to produce previously withheld evidence and to promise not to copy any more CD's illegally. But the agreement turned out to be worthless.
"They're more afraid of their shareholders than they are of the court," said Cheng Ching-ming, the Chinese representative for the association of music companies, referring to Mr. Pu's factory and his partners in Taiwan.
Mr. Pu, whose factory is in Suzhou, about 50 miles from Shanghai, denied any wrongdoing, saying his partner from Taiwan was to blame for any illegal activity.
"We never promised to produce more evidence," Mr. Pu said in an interview later. "We said we'd go back and check to see if there was any more. But we cannot remember anything else. We can't remember, you understand?"
In light of the broken agreement, the court is considering possible sanctions on the Suzhou factory. But it is unclear how enforceable any sanctions would be.
Only a handful of intellectual property cases in China have ever been decided in favor of foreign companies. The first was the Walt Disney Company's victory in Beijing Intermediate Court in August, when it won a $77,000 judgment against Chinese companies that were producing children's books based on Disney's animated films.
With the complications and costs of going to court, international lawyers say many foreign companies prefer to counter their product-piracy problem quietly, by administrative measures. That usually means fines and sanctions -- smaller and swifter than those that can be won in court -- ordered by officials known as the copyright police.
Yet rather than settle disputes quietly, Mr. Cheng and a growing number of foreign companies choose to go to court to win redress for specific wrongs and to set precedents aimed at discouraging other pirates. But they are finding that things often do not go as planned.
Mr. Cheng represents the International Federation of Phonographic Industries, a trade association of more than 200 music companies from the United States, Britain and Hong Kong, including Sony Music and Thorn EMI.
The companies say they are losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year from piracy of their recordings in China, a crime so rampant that it was a big element in the trade dispute that flared between the United States and China early this year, and was solved only when China agreed to a detailed plan to get tough on offenders.
The Suzhou case -- which lawyers call a crucial test of the campaign to clamp down on piracy -- originated early last year, when Mr. Cheng found evidence that Mr. Pu's factory was illegally copying foreign recordings of music. Shanghai authorities investigated and arrested a Taiwanese man, accusing him of supplying the factory with CD's and copying at least 120,000 of them to be sold in Southeast Asia.
Although the Suzhou factory managers would not discuss the case in detail, the sequence of events described by Mr. Cheng was verified by court officials and by lawyers familiar with the case.
About a year ago, Mr. Cheng filed a suit against the partner from Taiwan, Xu Huale. But, even though he was ordered to remain in the Shanghai area and had his passport confiscated, Mr. Xu somehow fled to Taiwan to escape prosecution. Mr. Cheng then shifted his focus to the Suzhou Baodi Electronic Equipment Company, accusing Mr. Pu and other managers of violating copyright laws.
In the following months, Mr. Cheng repeatedly came under pressure from various parts of the Chinese Government, with officials urging him to settle the case and arguing that the $1.8 million in damages being sought might put the factory out of business. Mr. Cheng responded that bankrupting the factory would be the clearest possible signal to pirates that China was serious about cracking down on intellectual property violations.
In part because Mr. Cheng originally persuaded the authorities in Shanghai to investigate, Shanghai Intermediate Court accepted the case and scheduled a court date.
A delicate negotiation ensued. The authorities from Beijing, Suzhou and Shanghai each discussed the case with judges in the Shanghai court, Mr. Cheng said. Officials from Su-zhou pleaded a combination of ignorance and poverty, saying that the factory managers had not known they were doing wrong and that it was unfair to single them out when piracy is so common in China.
Officials from Beijing, seeking to show their American counterparts that they were sincere about cracking down on intellectual property violations, wanted a speedy solution that at least gave the appearance of decisive action. (American officials say they welcome China's new willingness to consider cases involving foreign companies, but will continue to press for legal, rather than political, solutions.)
And officials from Shanghai, where many local companies are themselves the victims of intellectual piracy by other Chinese companies, also argued for firm action. A majority of intellectual property cases in China now are between domestic companies, and a growing number of Chinese companies are arguing for tougher penalties against offenders.
A decision was finally reached a few weeks ago, Mr. Cheng said, shortly before the trial was held. Under the agreement, Mr. Cheng would drop his case against the Suzhou factory and name Mr. Xu of Taiwan as the sole defendant. In exchange, officials of the Suzhou factory promised to apologize, to release documents they had refused to disclose and not to copy any more CD's.
In addition, Mr. Cheng said, the chief judge assured him that if any evidence turned up later indicating that the factory was still up to its old tricks, the court would accept a new case against the factory.
"It's not what we wanted," said Mr. Cheng, a Shanghai native who now holds Hong Kong travel documents. "But we have to cooperate with the court" even when deals fall apart.
Mr. Cheng pointed out that he was in a difficult position. As the representative of foreign music companies, his overarching concern is to stem pirating of CD's. But as part of a foreign organization allowed by China to operate an office in Shanghai, he cannot ignore the Government's wishes.
The agreement, Mr. Cheng said, was a carefully calculated political solution. It allowed a foreign plaintiff with hard evidence to win its case, but it also let the Suzhou factory off the hook. And then the court proceedings could heap blame on Mr. Xu, who had already escaped.
"By the time the session opened, it was very clear which side would win," Mr. Cheng said. "Otherwise they would not dare hold a court session."
"It's probably true that they didn't know much about the law when this case started," he said of his adversaries. "When I first visited their factory, they gave me a freshly copied CD as a gift. Can you believe it?"

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Turkish Nightmare

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
On my way home from Moscow a couple of weeks ago, I visited Turkey. Talk about a country in a bad neighborhood. Look at a map. Turkey today provides one-stop shopping to all the troubles of the post-cold-war world. Turkey is connected geographically, ethnically or politically to the problems of Iraq, Iran, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia, Cyprus, Greece, Bulgaria, Russia, Tajikistan, Syria and Islamic fundamentalism. All the Turks are missing is a border with Chechnya. No wonder Turkey had four foreign ministers last year. Turkish foreign policy today is a 360-degree nightmare.
It is also more important to the U.S. than ever before. During the cold war, Turkey was the southern fringe of the NATO alliance. Today, Turkey is the epicenter of a new regional system born from the ruins of the Soviet empire. It's called Eurasia, and it stretches from the Balkans across the Caucasus to the new states of Central Asia. This is a predominantly Muslim, Turkish-speaking or ethnically Turkish grouping of new states, many of them still groping for a political identity. 
 A weak Turkey will be consumed by the troubles of this region and project them into Europe. A strong Turkey, tied to the West, can radiate its values (and counter Iran's) to millions of Muslims from Azerbaijan to Kazakhstan -- values that are basically democratic and inclined toward moderate Islam and integration with the global economy.
But Turkey's own identity now hangs in the balance. The good news is that the Turks are about to be admitted into the European Community's customs union, which would make them part of the single E.U. common market. That integration is a vital U.S. interest, because it would solidly anchor Turkey to Western Europe and its secular, democratic, free-market systems.
The bad news is that on the eve of this historic opportunity, the Turks are being sucked back into the snake pit of Middle East politics. Northern Iraq has been a power vacuum ever since the U.S. banned Saddam Hussein from governing there. That vacuum has been filled partly by the Marxist Kurdish Workers Party, or P.K.K., which is trying to break off the eastern half of Turkey to create a Kurdish state. The Turks recently mounted a massive incursion into northern Iraq to crush the P.K.K. But here's the rub: Many members of the European Parliament, who have a romantic commitment to Kurdish nationalism and despise the Turks because they are Muslims, now want to use Turkey's attack on the P.K.K. as an excuse not to ratify Turkey's accession to the E.U. customs union.
The Clinton Administration, which played a smart and decisive role in persuading the E.U. to admit Turkey, needs to urgently launch a diplomatic offensive to preserve the fruits of its labor. The Administration has a sound Turkey policy, but it has a dead-end northern Iraq policy, and unless this is straightened out, Turkey is going to fall out of the E.U. right into the abyss of northern Iraq.
I see four options: Option One, preferred by most Turks, is to cut a deal with Saddam to restore his authority over northern Iraq and clamp down on the Kurds there. The U.S., which wants to keep Saddam boxed up in Baghdad, opposes this. Option Two, favored by Washington, is for the U.S. and Turkey to work together with the moderate, but rival, Iraqi Kurdish clans -- the Barzanis and Talabanis -- to set up a power structure that can fill the northern Iraq vacuum. (I have my doubts about this. The Iraqi Kurdish leaders are the Hatfields and McCoys, obsessed with their tribal feuds. They don't not have a state for nothing.)
Option Three is for Turkish troops to keep going into Iraq, which would mean constant friction with the E.U. Option Four is getting someone to offer an exploding cigar to Saddam so he will go "boom" and be replaced by "nice" Iraqi dictators whom the U.S. would let restore Baghdad's authority over Kurdish northern Iraq.
The bottom line: If Washington believes in Option Two it had better get cracking -- offer the Turks technical help with sealing their Iraqi border. Send a top U.S. official there to persuade the Iraqi Kurds to set aside their differences, control their territory and keep the P.K.K. out. And remind the Turks that the best way to fight Kurdish separatism is to make Turkish Kurds feel at home, with more freedom of expression and human rights.
If all this fails, start rummaging in the C.I.A.'s basement for those exploding Havana cigars.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says Weak Dollar Is Caused by Federal Deficits

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, today attributed the dollar's weakness to large Federal budget deficits and welcomed recent efforts to balance the budget.
In his first public comments since Congressional Republicans introduced plans last week to balance the budget by 2002, Mr. Greenspan emphasized the importance of deficit reduction to the American economy and the dollar's value. But in keeping with the Federal Reserve's tradition of nonpartisanship, he avoided any specific reference to any proposal. 
 "I am encouraged with the increased attention the persistent Federal budget imbalance and its consequences have been receiving in the past few years," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech here this morning to the directors of the National Association of Realtors. "Important steps have been taken, but it is essential that the momentum toward reducing, and eventually eliminating, the deficit be accelerated."
Today's comments, although vaguely worded, are significant because Republicans are hoping that Mr. Greenspan will hold down short-term interest rates to reward them for any success in cutting budget deficits. Democrats have begun to argue that if Congress were to cut the deficit sharply without any move by the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy, the economy might slow even further than it already has.
Mr. Greenspan's comments today strongly indicated that he thought serious deficit reduction would help the dollar's value, which might otherwise be undermined by lower or steady interest rates.
While Mr. Greenspan did not say so, a stronger dollar would also leave the Federal Reserve with more freedom to cut interest rates if it perceived the American economy to be slowing sharply. While the dollar has rebounded in the last week against the Japanese yen and German mark, it remains below its level at the beginning of the year.
Mr. Greenspan has consistently advocated deficit reduction, whether initiated by Democrats or Republicans. He was the object of Republican criticism in 1993 when he sat next to Hillary Rodham Clinton at the State of the Union address, leading some to conclude he was supporting President Clinton's deficit reduction effort that year.
Mr. Greenspan stopped short today of repeating his hint in Congressional testimony earlier this year that he might adopt a less restrictive monetary policy if Congress took decisive steps to curb the budget deficit. Instead, Mr. Greenspan spoke in another section of his speech today of the importance to business people of providing a stable business environment.
"I can assure you that it is not a goal of monetary policy to encourage fluctuations in interest rates, even if it does make your lives more interesting," Mr. Greenspan said.
The Federal Reserve's top interest-rate policy committee is scheduled to meet next Tuesday, but Fed officials have been playing down the prospects for policy changes then. While Mr. Greenspan did not specifically address what might happen next, it is unusual for him to mention interest rate policy at all so close to a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, and today's reference came early and prominently in the speech.
Mr. Greenspan was a little more specific in linking the dollar to budget deficits. Federal deficits, and the accompanying Government borrowing, are absorbing large sums of American savings and forcing the country to look abroad to finance investment, he said, adding that foreigners may be growing reluctant to continue providing money.
"Looking back at the history of the past century or more, the record would suggest that nations ultimately must rely on their domestic savings to support domestic investment," he said. "Given the weakness in the foreign exchange value of the dollar earlier this year, world capital markets may have been sending us just that message."

Gasoline Prices Set 3-Year Highs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Gasoline prices surged to three-year highs yesterday after an oil company reported another refinery shutdown just before the start of the busy summer driving season.
The Marathon Oil Company, a division of the USX Corporation, said it had shut down nearly half its 70,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Texas City, Tex., because of an unknown mechanical problem. The company said there had been a small release of pollutants and that it did not know when the gas component unit would be restarted. 
 The announcement was the latest in a string of shutdowns at American and foreign refineries that threaten to drive up wholesale prices significantly, analysts said.
On other commodity markets, lumber prices plunged on weak economic data and coffee prices retreated in technical selling. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities jumped 0.99 point, to 231.67.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gasoline for June delivery rose 1.40 cents, to 66.30 cents a gallon, the highest near-term contract price since June 10, 1992. Crude oil also rose, with the June contract ending at more than $20 a barrel for the first time in a week, settling 18 cents higher at $20.08 a barrel.

It's almost nothing but blue skies for Big Blue. At least for now.

BYLINE: By Laurence Zuckerman 

 BODY:
WHAT a difference a quarter makes. Since reporting surprisingly strong earnings on April 20, I.B.M.'s stock has surged nearly 9 percent. Analysts who saw the company outperform previous estimates by a wide margin have since raised their forecasts to twice what they were at the beginning of 1994 and are enthusiastically recommending the stock.
After pleasantly surprising wary investors for 12 months, could it be that the long I.B.M. nightmare is over? 
 "I.B.M. is on the verge of going from a cost-cutting story to a genuine momentum story," said James J. Cramer, president of Cramer & Company, a New York money manager. "We are entering Year Three of what is going to be a legendary turnaround."
Last year was the International Business Machine Corporation's first profitable one since 1990, earning $4.92 a share. The current analyst consensus is that I.B.M. will earn $9.19 a share this year and $10.37 in 1996, according to Zacks Investment Research. Many analysts now predict that 1996 will surpass I.B.M.'s all-time earnings record of $10.77 a share set in 1984.
"I don't see why the stock couldn't sell at $140 or higher sometime next year," said Shelton Swei, vice president at Fred Alger Management Inc. in New York. Shares of I.B.M. slipped 37.5 cents yesterday, to $94.625, still near its 52-week high of $96.875 set on April 27 and the highest the stock has been since July 1992.
It was only a few months ago that Mr. Cramer, who began buying I.B.M. shares when they hit a low of $41 in August 1993, sold most of his 500,000 shares. At the time, he believed that the company had reaped all the benefits of a campaign to cut overhead and would not see much future revenue growth. But after the company's latest results -- which showed healthy growth in virtually all its businesses, especially in services -- he began buying again and now holds 150,000 shares.
Mr. Cramer is particularly impressed that I.B.M. has amassed more than $10 billion in cash while spending $1.4 billion buying back stock.
"This is a company that is not a mainframe company anymore," he said. "It's going to be an ultimate-solutions provider. That's a high-margin business."
While few argue about the positive outlook for 1995, not everyone is so optimistic about next year. The bears note that I.B.M. has been riding a wave of lucky circumstance hard to sustain.
For example, a third of the company's 18 percent revenue gain in the quarter came from currency-exchange rates as the dollar weakened against local currencies in key markets like Japan and Germany. The strong economy and pent-up demand also helped the company register surprisingly strong sales of its old-style mainframes. I.B.M. also benefited from favorable comparisons with a weak first quarter in 1994.
If the dollar firms and the economy slows, as many analysts predict, I.B.M.'s momentum may slow as well. Also, I.B.M.'s increasing dependence on volume businesses like personal computers and growing competition from rival service providers could erode its profit margins, making increased revenue all the more important. And I.B.M. is nearing the end of the $8 billion cost-cutting campaign that has constituted the bulk of its renewed earnings strength.
"By mid-1996, I.B.M. will have eked out the maximum benefit from its cost and expense-cutting efforts in the previous three years," Bob Djurdjevic of Annex Research, an industry consultant based in Phoenix, wrote in a recent issue of his newsletter. "To grow its profits again, it will have to start growing its revenues first. That will be easier said than done."
Mr. Djurdjevic estimated that I.B.M.'s 1995 earnings would be stronger than predicted, but that its 1996 earnings would be much weaker, at $8.04 a share.
Steve Milunovich, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said, "My feeling is that I.B.M. will run into trouble again, but it will probably be when the stock is at a higher altitude."
Which, to some analysts, is forecasting too far. "For the next three quarters it's a no-brainer," Dan Mandresh, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company, said. "Wait until the stock gets to $125 and then we'll discuss it."

HEADLINE: Organic Industry Faces An Ethics Question

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL 

 BODY:
ORGANIC food customers have always relied on the good faith of growers, retailers and private certifying companies to assure them that the food they are buying has been raised with the fewest chemicals possible. But now, a class-action lawsuit filed recently in San Diego is shining a spotlight on the ethics and practices of the organic food industry, which is largely self-regulated.
In the suit, Nina Hopkins Brothers, 43, an organic-foods educator, charges that two produce companies and two associations that certify organic produce sold, as organic, Mexican bananas treated with a fungicide. 
 Although organic food is still a small part of the total food dollar, it is a rapidly growing part. Sales of organic food in the United States have soared 23 percent each year for five years, to $2.2 billion in 1994. The expansion has increased competition, brought in bigger companies and raised questions about whether self-policing should be replaced by Federal regulation. And consumers have become increasingly concerned about the purity of food.
Lawyers and members of the organic industry say that the suit, which was filed March 9 and seeks punitive damages as well as redress, is the first class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of organic consumers.
While rumors of taint and corner-cutting are commonplace among shoppers who seek organic produce and among retailers, the case of the questionable bananas is the first that "has reached a critical head and might affect consumer confidence," said Ken Mergentime, the associate editor of Natural Foods Merchandiser, a trade magazine in Boulder, Colo.
Indeed, many organic food customers interviewed in Berkeley, Calif.; Boston, and New York said the case could raise questions about all organic food.
"I would certainly be more leery of the organic label if it turns out that some growers are not being honest," said Nanette Cippa-Fukushima, a shopper at the Berkeley Bowl market in Berkeley. Customers, she added, "will start asking themselves if what they are buying is really organic."
For retailers, the issues raised by the questionable bananas are more pragmatic than they are emotional.
Bill Fujimoto, owner of the Monterey Market in Berkeley, has not stocked organic bananas for more than two years. "I may be assured by people with the greatest integrity that something is organic, but I can still have my doubts," he said. "The produce that comes out of Mexico right now seems to do so much too easily. There is a great deal of money involved, big new players. It's ripe for graft and manipulation. I have no details. It's just that the market is growing too fast."
Bob Scowcroft, the executive director of the Organic Farming Research Foundation in Santa Cruz, Calif., said the case "couldn't be better timed." He continued: "The case is a microcosm of every issue that the organic family faces. It questions standards, self-regulation and the role of government, as well as the impact of international growers and the effect of big-money success on what used to be a small niche market."
The case centers on tons of bananas grown in the Mexican states of Colima, Michoacan and Jalisco that, the suit says, were treated with chemical fungicides to combat black sigatoka, a tropical fungus that began to infest the states' plantations in 1990.
Filing alone on behalf of all organic banana customers, Ms. Brothers has charged that the companies violated the California Organic Act of 1990, committed fraud and deceit and misrepresented and falsely advertised their products.
Although the fungicides cannot legally be administered to organic produce sold in California, two companies are accused of importing, advertising and selling the fruit as organic -- the Mexican American Fruit Company of National City, Calif., and Made in Nature, a company based in San Rafael, Calif., that is now owned by the Dole Fruit Company.
In addition, the suit accuses two groups that certify organic produce, the Organic Crop Improvement Association of Bellefontaine, Ohio, and Quality Assurance International of San Diego of lending their stamp of approval to the treated fruit.
Made in Nature, stopped selling the bananas before the suit was filed.
"When they heard rumors about possible taint, they immediately withdrew the product," said Thomas Pernice, the vice president of public affairs at Dole Fruit in Los Angeles.
 The Mexican American Fruit Company still sells the bananas from the three Mexican states. "We believe the complaint is groundless, plan to fight it and expect to be vindicated," said the company's lawyer, Chris Healy of San Diego.
The two certification boards stand by the bananas in question. "The suit is useless and frivolous," said Griff McLellan, the director of Quality Assurance International.
Betty Kananen, the director of the Organic Crop Improvement Association, said that after review, her organization concluded that "the bananas that were treated were never represented as organic and that the bananas that were represented as organic were never treated."
Nevertheless, Ms. Kananen, whose organization has grown from 100 members in 1985 to nearly 20,000, said she was walking a fine line philosophically in choosing to fight the charges.
"The bigger the business is, the more chance there is for litigation, founded or unfounded," she said. "On the other hand, the organic industry has grown so fast that there is no way we can keep all the crooks out."
Mr. Scowcroft said "not a week goes by that I am not approached by venture capitalists interested in getting into the organic market, and I don't know of one major food company that isn't invovled in developing some organic product."
Along with major food corporations, Ms. Kananen said, isolated right-wing subsistence farmers have joined the "hard-core charter members who are by and large the sort of liberal environmentalists who have fought tooth and nail to maintain integrity and police themselves."
This internal diversification and growth, Ms. Kananen said, "has created a need for Federal regulation."
Eleven states have organic labeling laws, and most rely on -- and pay for the services of -- the country's 17 private certification companies to verify that food is organic. Generally, the certifiers visit commercial organic farms annually, test soil samples and collate records of agricultural chemical purchase and use to verify that growers are maintaining organic practices.
The charges in the lawsuit suggest that the time that elapses between such inspections and the investigation of complaints could allow nonorganic produce to be certified and sold. And Ms. Kananen said that impending Federal regulations could further slow investigations.
"The more bureaucracy and paper it takes to complete an investigation, the more chance there is that questionable product could hit the market," she said.
Like many growers, she says she hopes that the National Organic Program, a labeling law for fruits, vegetables, meats and processed foods that is being developed by the United States Agriculture Department, will not hinder timely response to consumer complaints.
But it is unclear when the Federal program, which seeks to establish a single national standard for organic food, will be set up, said Beth Hayden, a marketing specialist at the Agriculture Department in Washington. Meanwhile, the organic industry remains largely self-regulated.
Ms. Kananen said that the bulk of the complaints her association receives are "competitor driven" and are rarely substantiated. Of the 6,000 farms that have been certified by the Organic Crop Improvement Association over the last decade, for instance, only six have had their certification revoked. Noting that an equally small percentage of complaints have been substantiated in California since that state's organic foods act of 1990 went into effect, Mr. Scowcroft said, "Basically, self-regulation is working."
But to Ms. Brothers, who filed the suit, the bananas suggest that industry standards may be flagging.
"I teach the organic lifestyle to my patients all day long," said Ms. Brothers, who also is a practitioner of homeopathy, the leading Western scientific system of natural medicine. "And when they go out of their way to find organic food and pay up to three times as much to buy it, they deserve to know they are getting what they pay for."
In addition to raising legal and ethical concerns, the suit draws a furrow in a field long divided between people whose organic farming sprouted from environmental, taste or health concerns and those who produce organic food with an eye to profit.
Mr. Scowcroft said that organic farming is a business, not a movement. "The business is built on the consumer's right to know, but organic farming has always been a business," he said. "It has never been a not-for-profit movement.
"As the industry grows, the commitment to the public's right to know grays. The larger the business, the greater the pressure to move toward a less costly, less thorough delivery system of documentation."

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
A RESTAURANT complex capable of feeding thousands of people opens tomorrow in Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library. It is the latest of New York's mega-restaurants. And there are more to come.
Though big may not mean better food, restaurateurs say huge places are likely to be more profitable, and make it possible to give customers more for their money. 
 Just like the retailing giants flocking to the city, these restaurants are changing New York's dining scene. In the next few months, Crab House, a seafood chain, will open a 500-seat restaurant on Pier 61, at 21st Street, in the Chelsea Piers sports complex; the 350-seat Motown Cafe will open on West 57th Street; Robert Earl's 700-seat Official All Star Cafe will open in Times Square, and in Brooklyn, Lundy's in Sheepshead Bay is being renovated and will reopen with 800 seats in 17,000 square feet of space.
"It's easier to make money in a big restaurant," said Warner LeRoy, the owner of Tavern on the Green, which on Sunday served 2,800 dinners for Mother's Day. With 800 seats, its annual gross earnings are $32 million. But money is not the only attraction. "Big restaurants are also more fun," Mr. LeRoy said.
The Bryant Park complex is owned by Ark Restaurants, whose president, Michael Weinstein, started his portfolio with the Museum Cafe 20 years ago and recently bought Lutece.
Although Mr. Weinstein is accustomed to dealing with big restaurants -- his company owns the 350-seat America in the Flatiron District -- the Bryant Park operation is large even for him. Bryant Park Grill, an airy space that seats 220 in the wood and stone building with green trellis trim designed by Hugh Hardy, has a rustic formality. It can expand with 300 outdoor seats. The casual BP Cafe can accommodate another 700, and there is also a roof terrace with 200 seats.
On a glorious summer day, the restaurants could conceivably serve 4,000. "The numbers are staggering," said Ridgely Trufant, the manager of the Bryant Park complex. "I'll have 250 or so people just in the front of the house."
Increasingly, the charming 60-seat restaurant with impeccable food is the entrepreneur's nightmare, not dream. Few restaurateurs who are interested in the bottom line will even consider a space with less than 150 seats.
Other dining giants that have opened in New York in the last year include Cafe Centro in the Met Life Building, which has two dining areas seating 350 in addition to room for another 100 outdoors, and Brother's Bar-B-Que at 77th Street and Broadway, with 425 seats. Gramercy Tavern in the Flatiron District is no small potatoes either. It seats 260 in its main dining room along with 100 or so in the more informal barroom.
"In terms of management, going from 150 to 250 seats is not a backbreaking shift," said Michael Whiteman, who with his partner, Joseph Baum, is working on the renovation of Windows on the World. They hope the restaurant, which will seat 500 in three areas, will open by December. They expect gross sales to reach $35 million within two years.
Consumer demand for value, which began to affect all kinds of restaurants in the late 1980's, has also forced the restaurants to become larger. It is easier to serve casual food and charge less when the place seats hundreds.
Jonathan Waxman, the executive chef for Ark, planned the contemporary American menus for the Bryant Park restaurants, where the prices range from inexpensive in the outdoor cafe to a high of $18.95 for main dishes in the Grill.
"They say that volume cures all ills," he said. "It's largely true. With this kind of volume you have great buying power. And there is a point at which you don't have to increase your labor costs commensurately with the number of covers." For example, Mr. Waxman said, whether you have 30 seats or 100, you still need a bartender.
"I was scared to death of large restaurants," he said. "But once you learn how to organize and simplify, there's a lot you can do without sacrificing quality."
Providing high quality is the challenge. Mr. Whiteman said, "Quality is the easiest thing to fall apart."
One highly regarded chef who has accepted the challenge is Patrick Clark. He recently took over the vast kitchens, with 52 cooks, at Tavern on the Green. "You have to simplify some things and be realistic," he said. For example, the kitchen is so far from parts of the dining room that covers have to be put on the plates; that means he cannot use crisp garnishes -- that stylish tangle of fried leeks -- because they will become soggy.
Though efficient centralized management is critical to successful large restaurants, the daunting spaces are often broken into different areas, sometimes with separate kitchens, as at Bryant Park.
"You have to fracture the sheer size," Mr. Baum said. "And in the final analysis, you still have to think of it as serving the individual diner. You must pretend you're Andre Soltner all the time and never lose sight of that." At Windows on the World, there will be three kitchens, each with its own executive chef.
Though the potential for a high-profit margin is alluring, especially in New York, where the cost of doing business is greater than in other cities, big is not for everybody. For one thing, the start-up costs are immense. It's not just a matter of throwing a coat of paint on a storefront and changing the awning. Bayport Restaurant Group, which owns the Crab House, is investing $3 million to build the restaurant on Chelsea Piers. It is the first of three they plan to open in the region in the next year. One, seating about 300 in 10,000 square feet of space, will open in the fall in Great Neck, L.I., and the other will open next year on a pier in Edgewater, N.J., near the George Washington Bridge.
Often, merely negotiating for striking one-of-a-kind locations, which may be controlled by municipal agencies, takes much longer and eats more capital through planning costs and legal fees. Bryant Park, for example, took 11 years to develop. Ark Restaurants became involved in the project about five years ago, but still the restaurants are opening a year later than Mr. Weinstein had planned. The brutal winter of 1993-94 delayed construction because the ground was frozen.
Large restaurants have their own particular problems. Take storage. Ms. Trufant said that for the Bryant Park restaurants, beer deliveries are going to be made daily instead of the more typical once or twice a week. The restaurants have installed 25 phone lines just to register credit card payments. Mr. Weinstein said he also spent $100,000 to restore the statue of William Cullen Bryant, for whom the park is named.
Big restaurants usually take care of their own maintenance and printing. They have fleets of trucks that break down or get ticketed for double-parking. Tavern on the Green has its own upholstery shop. "And the bigger you are the more interested the unions are in you," Mr. LeRoy of Tavern on the Green said.
At one time, he owned the 800-seat Potomac in Washington, which is now owned by Ark Restaurants and has been renamed Sequoia. Mr. LeRoy said he sold it because he had landlord problems. "I spent $1 million in legal fees in one year," he said. "In retrospect, I probably should not have sold it. The restaurant was doing $11 million." There is a new landlord. And John Poon, who was the chef at Sequoia, is the executive chef at Bryant Park.
Like Mr. LeRoy, Mr. Weinstein and other restaurateurs find running big restaurants exciting. Frank Cretella, whose company, Tam Restaurant Group of Staten Island, owns Lundy's in Sheepshead Bay, said, "You create a whole atmosphere with a different kind of energy."
Nick Valenti, the chairman of Restaurant Associates, which owns Cafe Centro, explained that big restaurants make it possible to have enough seats to take care of the business at the busy times.
"To make value pay you need more seats and a good turnover," he said. "Each restaurant has its break-even point. After that, a certain percentage of every order will drop to the bottom line. The bigger you are the easier it gets.
Sometimes, a restaurateur does not need sheer size for high volume. Steve Hanson owns Isabella's on the Upper West Side, which serves more than 1,000 meals a day with 150 seats in 1,800 square feet of space. "That's not typical," he said. One of his other restaurants, Park Avalon in the Flatiron District, has 185 seats in 7,000 square feet and handles the same volume. But he, too, is looking at larger spaces, 300 seats near Lincoln Center and 250 in lower Manhattan.
"The economy of scale just works," he said. "It takes the same amount of energy to run if you do it right. But it's a double-edged sword because it can wipe you out faster. There's nothing like looking at a $35,000 weekly payroll and being faced with a major snowstorm."
And right now, in Bryant Park, no one is praying for rain.

HEADLINE: Mr. Moynihan's Sensible Welfare Plan

 BODY:
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, who knows as much about welfare policy as anyone in the country, has broken a silence on the issue with a blast of scorn for nearly everyone engaged in the battle on Capitol Hill. He has ridiculed Republicans for proposing "punishing, punitive" welfare reform and President Clinton for inviting the G.O.P. attack by promising reforms he could not achieve. The Senator offers a welfare plan of his own that provides an alternative to root for.
The criticism of Mr. Clinton is partly unfair. Yes, his campaign to impose time limits on welfare benefits invited the G.O.P. to press for even harsher limits. But at least he acknowledged the Government's responsibility to provide jobs -- along with child care and health insurance -- to recipients who exhaust their benefits but cannot find employment. The President can more properly be faulted for disappearing from the debate. He needs to back up his approach by pledging to veto any bill that strips poor families of all Federal guarantees of cash and food assistance. At least then, the Democrats will stand for something firm and just. 
 Mr. Moynihan's criticism of the Senate Republicans is on target. They plan to end Federal entitlements for cash and perhaps for food stamps. They would turn over fixed blocks of money to the states to use with no requirement that states contribute their own money. With some exceptions, states could use the Federal money pretty much as they please. Block grants would take little account of the need for Washington to help out during recessions when poverty rolls swell. Block grants would also invite states -- without fear of losing Federal money -- to cut benefits and apply the savings to keeping taxes low as a strategy to attract business and repel the poor. The House takes the Senate's bad plan and makes it worse, adding restrictions that would prevent states from helping legal immigrants and teen-age mothers.
Mr. Moynihan points out that the G.O.P. has no evidence that its punitive measures would cut down out-of-wedlock births or welfare dependency. He proposes a sensible alternative -- building on the 1988 Family Support Act, which he sponsored. Under that law, Congress provides matching funds to states for welfare-to-work programs. The act has produced disappointing results in part because Congress appropriated an inadequate $1 billion a year.
Mr. Moynihan would increase Federal money, reduce the state share and raise the percentage of recipients that states would be required to put into welfare-to-work programs. He would also give states more freedom to experiment with their own reforms. The strategy is sound because studies show that well-designed welfare-to-work programs have modestly reduced state welfare rolls.
Modest may not sound exciting -- stacked up against the President's pledge to overhaul welfare and the G.O.P.'s pledge to smash it. But Mr. Moynihan offers the only plan before Congress that is both feasible and compassionate.

HEADLINE: Science Is for Childless Women

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am one of those women who "leaked" out of the pipelines referred to in "Why Science Loses Women in the Ranks" (Week in Review, May 14). 
 There is no question that the hours are long and demanding for a bench scientist, and that this is difficult to reconcile with a family. However, the idea of solving this problem by "devoting time to the kids when they are young and coming back to the lab full-force when infant needs abate" is so unrealistic as to be comical.
In bench science, no second prizes are awarded, and the economic situation demands unrelenting writing of grant applications and publication of results.
I have not met a woman yet who, for example, left a tenure-track position in science to take four or five years out for raising infants and then returned to the tenure track.
In my experience, my female colleagues worked to within a week of delivery and averaged four weeks or less of maternity leave; maternity leave being time spent at home with an infant in one hand and a telephone connected to the lab in the other.
With funding for the biological sciences undergoing dramatic cuts, you will also find very few female scientists willing to discuss their difficulties for fear of being labeled lame ducks within their departments. It is not surprising that many eventually make a heart-wrenching decision to leave bench science to those who have no children or to those who are fortunate to have that acknowledged asset, a wife.
Women scientists are not so special. The vast majority of working women in the United States compromise their careers to raise their children.
This is not necessarily due to their spouses' refusal to contribute to parenting, but is more a practical decision driven by the fact that men are still commonly better paid than their wives, and it is the job with the lower wages that gets compromised to accommodate the needs of a new child.
Until the provision of child care is given a high priority and care givers are recognized as protecting our most precious resource, women will never fulfill their true career potential in any competitive field; scientific research is only one example of this phenomenon.

HEADLINE: U.S. Makes A New Offer To Serbian

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
Grasping for ways to slow the renewed fighting in Bosnia, an American diplomat has presented Serbia's President with a new plan that would offer Serbia greater relief from sanctions than a previous rejected offer if in return it recognizes Bosnia's borders, Western diplomats said today.
The officials said they hoped the new plan, which was presented to Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, in talks on Tuesday and today in Belgrade, would win his assent because it offers him more relief from sanctions than did a plan he rejected last winter. 
 He had rejected the previous plan because he wanted sanctions eased before he recognized Bosnia. The new plan promises faster relief than did the previous plan.
The new plan calls on Serbia to recognize Bosnia's borders -- a step that Western diplomats say would be an important one toward reducing tension -- and allow the United Nations to station more monitors along Serbia's borders to cut off trade with and the Bosnian Serbs. The plan also calls on Serbia to grant limited recognition to Croatia.
In return, Administration officials said, the United Nations would suspend economic sanctions on Serbia, except for the embargo on oil and arms.
"We hope it would be a defusing step that would back all the tensions down," a senior Administration official said.
In the hope of getting Serbia to step up pressure on the Bosnian Serbs, the new offer suggests that all sanctions on Serbia would be lifted, and not just suspended, if the Bosnian Serbs accept a compromise map that would give Bosnia's Muslim-dominated Government control of 51 percent of the country's land. The Bosnian Serbs, who now control more than 70 percent of Bosnia, would be given 49 percent.
"We have no indication that Milosevic is ready to accept at this point," a senior State Department official said.
American diplomats said the plan is intended to get Mr. Milosevic to apply more pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to make peace, to isolate them diplomatically and to cut off the flow of arms and goods that they need to continue fighting.
"All this is aimed at strangling Pale," said an Administration official, referring to the headquarters of the Bosnian Serbs.
Serbian recognition would not lead to immediate peace in Bosnia since Bosnia's Serbs have grown increasingly defiant of Mr. Milosevic. Nonetheless, such recognition is considered important because Mr. Milosevic, who is widely seen as having instigated the war, would in effect give up his dream of adding most of Bosnia to a Greater Serbia.
The new offer was completed last Friday at a meeting in Frankfurt of senior officials from the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Frasure went to Belgrade this week to present the plan to Mr. Milosevic.
American diplomats see several reasons why Mr. Milosevic might accept the revised plan when he rejected a previous one, with the assertion that the sanctions relief should come before Serbia recognized Bosnia's border, not after. The United States sees Mr. Milosevic as the most powerful leader in the Balkans and a pivotal figure in any peace efforts in the former Yugoslavia.
According to American diplomats, Mr. Milosevic is concerned about a possible pullout of United Nations forces and was jolted and disappointed by the successful offensive undertaken two weeks ago by Croatia's Government against Serb-held territory in Croatia. These diplomats said he is also worried by the Bosnian Government's recent offensive and by increasing talk about lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government.
Another important factor, American diplomats say, is that Mr. Milosevic has recognized that he will not be able persuade the United States and its allies to lift sanctions before he recognizes Bosnia.
According to one official, the new plan would suspend sanctions for 200 days if Mr. Milosevic recognizes Bosnia's borders. But he would not have to recognize Bosnia's Government formally.
Bosnia's Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, sent a letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher today urging the Administration to use its influence to persuade its allies to allow air strikes in response to recent shelling by the Bosnian Serbs.
"If that is not accepted by your allies, then it is absolutely high time for the United States of America to unilaterally lift the illegal arms embargo on the Bosnian Government," he wrote.
The Clinton Administration has sought to persuade Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, to drop plans to introduce legislation that calls on the United States to lift the embargo on its own.
After meeting here today with Mr. Christopher, Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said his nation had no immediate plans to withdraw its peacekeeping troops from Bosnia. The two officials, said, however that they backed efforts to make the peacekeepers' mission more effective.

HEADLINE: ETHICAL INQUIRIES: THE PACKWOOD CASE;
Ethics Panel in Senate Accuses Packwood of Sexual Misconduct

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
The Senate Ethics Committee today accused Bob Packwood, chairman of the Senate's most important committee, of bringing "discredit upon the United States Senate" through sexual misconduct, tampering with evidence and seeking help from lobbyists to get his wife a job.
After a 30-month investigation, which Senator Packwood delayed at one point by going to court in a futile effort to block a subpoena for his diaries, the committee said it had found "substantial credible evidence" for each of its three charges. 
 The committee told the Senator, a 62-year-old Oregon Republican, that he could meet with its members to answer the charges or could request hearings to have the accusations examined in detail, an option the committee has even if Mr. Packwood does not seek it.
As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, whose vast jurisdiction includes taxes, trade, health, unemployment insurance and welfare, Mr. Packwood occupies a decisive legislative position. Ordinarily dozens of senators would depend on him for favors. But he now faces a very uncertain future before the tight-lipped Ethics Committee, which has given no indication what it proposes to do next.
Mr. Packwood left a Finance Committee hearing on Medicare this morning to talk to reporters but declined to discuss the substance of the charges, saying, "It is irresponsible for me to comment on them."
Mr. Packwood, who had previously called for public hearings in the case, would not say whether he would seek them now. But he said he welcomed the opportunity "to request an appearance before the committee." He gave testimony under oath to committee aides for five days in January but said today that "I did not have a chance to appear" before the committee itself "at this preliminary stage."
The sexual misconduct charges against Mr. Packwood are the most detailed, citing 18 complaints by women who have sworn that he made unwelcome advances. But the accusation that he altered his diaries once he became aware that the committee would subpoena them as evidence may be the most menacing. The committee said there was a substantial basis to conclude that this effort was either "improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate
 and/or possible violations of Federal law" -- that is, obstruction of justice, a subject of a parallel investigation of Mr. Packwood now under way at the Justice Department.
Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who heads the Ethics Committee, and Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, the vice chairman, declined to discuss the case today, as did other committee members. Senators McConnell and Bryan scheduled a news conference for Thursday, but they are unlikely to offer a timetable for resolving the case. In the turgid habits of the Senate, ethics proceedings usually last for years.
Committee members have not discussed possible punishments, which range from a letter of reprimand from the committee to a vote of censure by the full Senate or even expulsion.
Another punishment was urged in Portland, Ore., today by three of the women who have accused the Senator of sexual misconduct: Mary Heffernan, Gena Hutton and Gail Byler. At a news conference, all three suggested that the Senate oust Mr. Packwood from the chairmanship of the Finance Committee. "We are asking that Senator Packwood be fired," Ms. Heffernan said.
Ms. Heffernan, now a Portland consultant, has accused Mr. Packwood of squeezing her arm and kissing her on the mouth while they were in his Senate office in 1981 or 1982, when she was a lobbyist. Ms. Hutton, a campaign worker in 1980, has accused him of kissing her, forcing his tongue into her mouth and inviting her to his hotel room then. Ms. Byler has accused him of running his hand up her leg and touching her crotch when she worked as a dining room hostess in Portland in 1970.
The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, declined to answer today when asked whether Mr. Packwood should step down as chairman of the Finance Committee until the case is resolved. Mr. Dole, himself the Finance chairman in the early 1980's, worked closely with Mr. Packwood on the committee last year, especially on health care.
Indeed, Mr. Packwood abandoned his longtime support for universal health insurance to help Mr. Dole kill President Clinton's plan. "We've killed health care reform," Mr. Packwood said in a discussion with other Republican senators at the time. "Now we've got to make sure our fingerprints are not on it."
This year Mr. Packwood has endorsed Mr. Dole for President.
The depth of the "resolution for investigation" that the Ethics Committee issued today surprised some senators and Senate aides, who had feared that the committee would slough off the matter. Indeed, the resolution reported that some members thought it was unfair to hold against Mr. Packwood any accusations made before 1976, the year in which the Federal courts "recognized quid pro quo sexual harassment as discrimination under the Civil Rights Act, and the Senate passed a resolution prohibiting sex discrimination in the United States Senate." But 10 of the 18 complaints of unwanted advances refer to encounters after 1976.
The committee concluded that there was substantial credible evidence "that Senator Packwood may have abused his United States Senate office by improper conduct which has brought discredit upon the United Senate, by engaging in a pattern of sexual misconduct between 1969 and 1990."
On the alteration of his diaries, an offense that has been sworn to by Cathy Wagner Cormack, an aide who transcribed them, the committee found substantial credible evidence that he "intentionally altered diary materials that he knew or should have known the committee had sought or would likely seek as part of its preliminary inquiry."
The committee also listed, without naming them, five lobbyists who had business before committees Mr. Packwood served on, and concluded that there was substantial credible evidence that he "may have abused his United States Senate office through improper conduct by inappropriately linking personal financial gain to his official position."
 His former wife, Georgie Packwood, has said that after they separated in January 1990, but before their divorce became effective on May 20, 1991, several lobbyist allies of Mr. Packwood offered her jobs, which could have reduced his alimony.

Chart: "SUMMARY: The Charges Against Senator Packwood"
 The Senate Ethics Committee issued charges of ethical misconduct against SenatorBob Packwood, an Oregon Republican, based on numerous incidents of what it said was improper behavior. The most detailed of the charges was that of a pattern of sexual misconduct.
 
ALTERING EVIDENCE
 The committee said there was substantial bases to conclude that the Senator might have intentially altered his diaries when he knew or should have known it would seek them. This effort may have violated a Federal obstruction of justice statute, the committee said.
 
ABUSE OF OFFICE FOR FINANCIAL GAIN
 The committee said there was a substantial evidence, including sworn testimony and documents, to conclude that the Senator might have improperly solicited financial support for his estranged wife from five lobbysts and businessmen who had interests in legislation that he could influence.
 
The report said the Senator might have linked "personal financial gain to his official position," abusing his office and bringing discredit on the United States Senate.
 
A PATTERN OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT
 The committee said its charge of misconduct was based on 18 separate accusations of unwelcome advances made by the Senator toward staff members, campaign aids and lobbyists:
 
1990, SENATE OFFICE "Grabbed a staff member by the shoulders and kissed her on the lips."
 
1985, BEND, ORE., "Fondled a campaign worker as they danced. Later that year, in Eugene, Ore., in sayging goodnight and thank you to her, Senator Packwood grapped [her] face with his hands, pulled her towards him, and kissed her, forcing his tongue into her mouth."
 
1981 OR 1982, SENATE OFFICE "Squeezed the arms of lobbyist, leaned over and kissed her on the mouth."
 
1981, CAPITOL BASEMENT "Walked a former staff assistant into a room where he grabbed her with both hands in her hair and kissed her, forcing his tongue into her mouth."
 
1980, EUGENE, ORE. "Pulled a campaign worker toward him, put his arms around her, and kissed her, forcing his tongue in her mouth. He also allegedly invited her to his motel room."
 
1980 OR EARLY 1981, PORTLAND, ORE. "On two separate occasions, he kissed a desk clerk who worked for the hotel."
 
1980, SENATE OFFICE "Grabbed a staff member by the shoulders, pushed her onto a couch and kissed her on the lips. The staff member tried several times to get up, but Senator Packwood repeatedly pushed her back on the couch."
 
1979, SENATE OFFICE "Started talking with a staff member and suddenly leaned down and kissed her on the lips."
 
1977, CAPITOL ELEVATOR "On numerous occasions, he grabbed the elevator operator by the shoulders, pushed her to the wall of the elevator and kissed her on the lips. He also alllegedly went to her home, kissed her and asked her to make love with him."
 
1977, OREGON COAST "Grabbed a prospective employe by her shoulders, pulled her to him and kissed her."
 
1975, SENATE OFFICE "Grabbed the staff assistant [mentioned in the fourth instance above] pinned her against a wall or desk, held her hair with one hand, bending her head backwards fondling her with his other hand and kissed her, forcing his tongue into her mouth."
 
1975, SENATE OFFICE "grabbed a staff assistant around her shoulders, held her tightly while pressing his body into hers, and kissed her on the mouth.
 
Early 1970s, PORTLAND "Chased a staff assistant around a desk."
 
1970, PORTLAND "Ran his hand up the leg of a dining room hostess and touched her crotch area."
 
1970, SENATE OFFICE "Grabbed a staff member by the shoulders and kissed her on the mouth."
 
1969, SENATE OFFICE "Made suggestive comments to a prospective employee."
 
1969, SENATOR'S HOME "Grabbed an employee of another Senator who was babysitting, rubbed her shoulders and back, and kissed her on the mouth. He also put his arm around her and touched her leg as he drove her home."
 
1969, PORTLAND "Grabbed a staff worker, stood on her feet, grabbed her hair, forcibly pulled her head back and kissed her on the mouth, forcing his tongue into her mouth. Senator Packwood also reached under her skirt and grabbed her undergarments.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Trade Fight's Two Gladiators Square Off

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
Two seasoned political operatives are keeping a wary eye on each other from a distance of 7,000 miles, each pushing a political and an economic agenda that leaves the other mystified.
Mickey Kantor works from the old Winder Building across from the White House, where Abraham Lincoln used to consult his generals. Ryutaro Hashimoto, his hair slicked back and his cigarette holder ever present, works from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Tokyo, where the world's most productive and protected automobile industry was built from scratch. 
 Mr. Kantor, 55, is the ultimate political loyalist, and regardless of whether the 100 percent sanctions he has declared against $5.9 billion in Japanese luxury cars open Japan's markets, they will certainly play well in the Midwest and in union halls, territories President Clinton has alienated and wants to reclaim.
Mr. Hashimoto, 57, known in Tokyo as "the Prince," has a reputation for toughness and arrogance; he sees himself as Japan's next prime minister, maybe within months. Standing up to the Americans, many believe, is his strategy for realizing his life's ambition.
In private, the two get along passably well -- "two of a kind," one American official who knows them both said -- and talk about everything from Shintoism to baseball to their college days. But in public, they are performers, and the bombast spills out easily. Asked about Mr. Kantor at a recent news conference, Mr. Hashimoto quipped, "He's scarier than my wife when I come home drunk."
Today Mr. Kantor and Mr. Hashimoto are so far apart that both Japanese and American leaders fear they may be headed toward a far larger collision than either intended. The immediate subject is cars, but both are quick to say that the real issue is jobs, and a clash of two economic systems whose differences have been papered over, but never reconciled. Both talk about "containing" their disputes to the economic sphere, but both worry that the other is already poisoning the well.
"Every time the United States and Japan have faced trouble I've been able to see the way out," said a senior Japanese official who has worked closely with Mr. Hashimoto. "On this issue, I can't figure out how it will be resolved. We've never been this far apart." They meet again next week in Paris, doubtless in the first of many contentious sessions.
Mr. Kantor has been preparing for this confrontation ever since he moved from chairman of the Clinton campaign to become United States trade representative, a post that is usually considered out of the mainstream of policy-making. It was hardly his first choice. Nevertheless, Mr. Kantor attacked the job tenaciously and changed it along the way. He took a central role in pushing through two of Mr. Clinton's biggest international initiatives, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the accord that created the World Trade Organization.
He has dominated China policy -- often to the chagrin of the State Department -- calculating correctly that the Chinese would back down in the face of sanctions over the violation of American intellectual property rights. Now, with far bigger stakes, he is trying the same strategy with the Japanese.
"In the 1950's and the 1960's we could afford to open our markets and let countries like Japan maintain sanctuary markets," he said this morning over breakfast with a number of reporters. "There was a cold war on, and it was the right policy at the time. But we can't afford to do it anymore. We were 40 percent of the world economy then, and we are 20 percent of the world economy now."
Mr. Hashimoto also talks of a new age -- an age in which Japan emerges from America's shadows and stands up for itself. He has vowed to Japanese reporters that this trade dispute will be different from all the others, that Japan will not back down at the last minute. Whether he is bluffing is the subject of endless speculation within the Clinton Administration. Even his fellow Japanese politicians say they do not understand his endgame.
But this is hardly the first time American demands have gotten Mr. Hashimoto's back up. During the Persian Gulf war in 1991, when he was Finance Minister, the United States Ambassador to Tokyo, Michael H. Armacost, was pressing for Japan to make a huge contribution to the effort. Mr. Hashimoto resisted, but in the end he was forced to back down: Japan paid $13 billion, and Mr. Hashimoto let it be known he thought America was not sufficiently grateful for the contribution. Moreover, he resented the pressure and Mr. Armacost's quickness to do an end-run around him, negotiating with one of his biggest political rivals, Ichiro Ozawa.
When the current American Ambassador to Tokyo, Walter F. Mondale, called on Mr. Hashimoto at the Japanese politician's private office, the resentments were still there. As Mr. Hashimoto sat smoking, the former Vice President noted that new no smoking rules were in effect at the embassy.
"I guess I won't be visiting you very often," Mr. Hashimoto replied. Mr. Mondale, who has been through his share of political compromises, offered to meet Mr. Hashimoto in the embassy parking lot, where he could both smoke and find a rare concentration of American-made cars.
But if the Administration finds Mr. Hashimoto prickly and unpredictable -- he and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin are on particularly bad terms -- so do his own bureaucrats. Mr. Hashimoto has been known to walk into negotiations and toss aside his notes, to the horror of his minions. That happened last fall, when he and Mr. Kantor broke a deadlock over the importation of American-made glass to Japan, one of the country's most hermetically sealed markets.
"He's pragmatic, realistic," Mr. Kantor said of his sparring partner the other day, whom he called Ryu. "I don't see him as an impediment."
Whether Mr. Hashimoto will be is unclear. He has often accused Mr. Kantor of moving the goal posts, and has wondered aloud whether the Clinton Administration really wants an agreement.
But the two men are talking the same language. Mr. Kantor says his actions will help "not only American workers but Japanese consumers," who need a break from high prices borne of anticompetitive practices; Mr. Hashimoto said that the sanctions would harm "not only the Japanese auto manufacturers, but also consumers and workers in the United States, as well as the free trading system of the world."
For both men, there is the lingering question of their next step. One possibility is that Mr. Hashimoto will hold the line against the United States and, if pushed too hard by the Japanese auto makers or his colleagues in the Liberal Democratic Party to cave in, he will resign in protest. That would allow a deal to go through and still leave Mr. Hashimoto on the moral high ground against his chief rival for the prime ministership, Foreign Minister Yohei Kono.
For his part, Mr. Kantor is forever fending off rumors that he is about to be swept back into politics, perhaps to run the Clinton re-election campaign. "I'm tired of hearing this," he said today. "Can't everyone see that I love what I'm doing?"

HEADLINE: College Segregation Persists, Study Says

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 17

 BODY:
Not one of 12 states that formerly administered segregated universities or colleges can demonstrate an "acceptable level of success in desegregating its higher education system," according to a comprehensive study released today, the 41st anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling.
Instead, the report found that most flagship universities in the South remain more than 80 percent white, that 60 percent of black freshmen attend historically black colleges or junior colleges and that success rates for minorities, measured in graduation rates and enrollment in graduate schools, are stagnant or falling in all 12 states. 
 The report, compiled by some of the nation's top scholars and educators for the Southern Education Foundation, a group devoted to improving minority access to higher education, concluded that a 1992 Supreme Court decision provided an opportunity comparable to the Brown ruling to truly desegregate colleges and universities. In the ruling, U.S. v. Fordice, the Court said Mississippi had failed to satisfactorily desegregate its public higher education system.
The study said that changes at all levels of education would be necessary to bring about true desegregation in higher education. Improvements in school financing and curriculums are needed from the elementary level on up, the report said.
But at a time when education budgets and student aid are facing major cuts, the study painted a largely bleak picture of progress for black and Hispanic people in the states that as a group are adding the most population and have the largest percentage of minority members.
The study said that society had promised equal access to institutions of higher education regardless of race but that not a single state "can demonstrate an acceptable level of success" in reaching that goal.
To achieve equal representation of blacks among college graduates, each of the 12 states would have to more than double the number of black graduates. For Hispanic students the challenge is even greater.
And experts say that while the report looked largely at colleges and universities in the South, its findings, particularly that rising tuition and declining tuition grants for low-income students are freezing minority students out of higher education, is true across the nation as well.
"The access of poor people to higher education fell dramatically across the board in the 1980's," said Gary Orfield, a professor of education and public policy at Harvard and an expert on desegregation who served as an adviser to the study. "The shifts discussed in the report are in various forms occurring across the nation."
The report examined 12 of the 19 states that established segregated educational systems after the Civil War: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.
The study found that:
*In 8 of the 12 states, fewer than 10 percent of black freshmen were enrolled in their state's largest and most prestigious institutions.
*Black and Hispanic people are underrepresented among bachelor's degree recipients in every state and in virtually every field of study.
*The kind of financial aid most needed by low-income families, who are disproportionately minorities, is declining. In the 1970's, more students received need-based Pell Grants from the Federal Government than borrowed under Federal student loan programs. For 1995, the number of borrowers anticipated will be nearly 70 percent higher than the number of grant recipients and more than four times as much Federal money will be spent on loans as grants.
"One result of these changes," the section of the report on student aid concluded, "is that financial aid is now more oriented toward the needs of middle- and upper-middle-income students than it is to those of low-income students. Another is that students and their families are now paying about 138 percent of what they paid in 1980 to attend college."
In Mississippi, for example, tuition at public colleges and universities represents about 40 percent of the income of the average minority family. Blacks make up 43 percent of the state's college-age population, but only 11.8 percent of recipients of degrees at public institutions. Fewer blacks earned bachelor's degrees in 1991 than in 1979.
Other concerns cited in the report include the colleges' reliance on standardized tests that tend to exclude minority members, the shortage of minority faculty and administrators, and the degree to which the racial and social climate on campuses can be less than welcoming to minorities.
Experts say the findings reflect a lack of aggressive commitments to promote integration more than a desire to keep campuses segregated. In the 12 states, blacks account for 25 percent of the college-age population, but represent only 16 percent of full-time freshmen and 10 percent of bachelor's degree recipients. Blacks account for less than 4 percent of total doctorates awarded.
"Primarily, we're talking about historically very entrenched systems of segregation," said N. Joyce Payne, director of the office of Public Black Colleges of the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges.
The report studied 12 of the 19 states that after the Civil War established segregated colleges and universities. Most were desegregated during the civil rights era. But, until 1992, there was no Federal court ruling mandating desegregation comparable to the Brown decision, which covered elementary and secondary education. The 1992 decision, U.S. v. Fordice, required that states go beyond race-neutral admissions to desegregate higher education but did not compel any specific course of action. The court did, however, discuss four areas that could contribute to insufficient desegregation: admission standards, program duplication, institutional mission assignments and the continued operation of eight separate public universities dating to the days of legal segregation.
The ruling opened up a range of possibilities, like merging black and white institutions, changing admissions standards, offering courses that would lure blacks to white institutions and vice versa, offering remedial programs and other measures to foster desegregation.
Many educators and most blacks insist that desegregation cannot come at the expense of the historically black institutions. But many also contend that financially strapped Southern states are left with the vestiges of a dual system of education that is economically inefficient.
Indeed, some on the report panel had some misgivings about recommending against the consolidation of black and white colleges and universities. But they agreed that wholesale closings of black colleges would be unacceptable and that desegregation cannot be achieved at the expense of the institutions that historically have done the most to educate blacks.

HEADLINE: Abortion Clinic's Landlord Says He Feared Violence

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., May 17

 BODY:
Ronald Morey, a Garden City landlord, testified today that from the moment he acquired a building on Stewart Avenue a year ago, he so feared violent anti-abortion protests that he tried to break an 11-year lease with an abortion clinic there.
"On the one hand, I'm trying to protect the clinic's rights, and on the other hand protect the rights of anti-abortionists to peacefully protest," Mr. Morey said. "It's a delicate balancing act and I'm caught on the fence." 
 Later, outside court, he added: "If my wife came to that building to see a dentist and get her teeth cleaned and she was accosted, I wonder who the dentist would hold responsible. I am not prepared to put principle in place of everyone's safe use of that building."
Mr. Morey is trying to evict the clinic, Long Island Gynecological Services, and lawyers at a hearing today in State Supreme Court before Justice John DiNoto tried to depict the case as nothing more than a landlord-tenant dispute.
But it has attracted national attention because it offers a rare peek at the impact of the pressure that anti-abortion protesters have placed on all kinds of companies, from landlords to plumbers to medical suppliers, that do business with abortion clinics.
The case was also seen as a new challenge to a year-old Federal law that guarantees access to abortion clinics, prompting the United States Attorney's Office in Brooklyn to monitor events at the clinic.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a co-sponsor of the Federal law, said Mr. Morey's testimony "shows that economic pressures are being exerted on clinics and that it's a serious problem."
The landlord testified that projectiles, ranging from lead sinks to bullets, had been fired at the windows in his building, that the windshield of his car had been smashed in the parking lot and that a 72-year-old nurse employed by a doctor with offices on the same floor of the clinic had been accosted by protesters twice, once with a knife.
Protests are held regularly outside the building, and in January a sign was posted warning: "Danger. This is a war zone. People are being killed here -- like Boston. You risk injury or death if you are caught on or near these premises."
Mr. Morey said, "When death occurred at an abortion clinic in Brookline, Mass., and other people were being killed at clinics around the country, I realized I had to do something to assure the safety of my tenants." In January, he issued a new rule for tenants prohibiting them from performing abortions.
"No other tenant was causing any problems," he said. "I know that had abortions not been taking place there, we would not be here in court today."
Mr. Morey is the principal owner of the three-story glass-enclosed building at 1103 Stewart Avenue, where the abortion clinic has leased space on the second floor until the year 2003. The other tenants include several doctors and lawyers, as well as Mr. Morey's radio station, WDRE, which occupies the third floor.
He said he acquired the building in a bankruptcy sale a year ago, and tried to negotiate an agreement to break the lease with the clinic's owner, Dr. Moshe Hochamavitz.
He said Dr. Hochamavitz had expressed strong interest in moving the clinic elsewhere, saying he did not want to be where he was not wanted or where he created any problems.
During a break in the hearing, Mr. Morey said that an agreement had been worked out in the last several days, which, in part, included a cash settlement. "But the day after I agreed to the settlement in principle, Dr. Hochamavitz rejected it, much to the chagrin of his own attorney," Mr. Morey said.
Dr. Hochamavitz was present for most of today's hearing, expecting to be called as a witness, either by his own lawyer, David I. Rosenberg, or Mr. Morey's lawyer, Joseph J. Ortego. Dr. Hochamavitz, however, declined to comment on the matter.
Mr. Rosenberg, who called Mr. Morey as his first witness, said he was pleased that Mr. Morey had acknowledged that he wanted "to break the lease with the clinic because he wanted to halt the clinic's performance of abortions."
"This does not meet the legal requirement of a reasonable act," Mr. Rosenberg said.
Justice DiNoto, who kept both lawyers on a tight time schedule and limited their questions when they began to be repetitive, said the hearing would resume on Thursday afternoon. Dr. Hochamavitz is expected to be among those called to the stand.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
In Surprise Sale, McClatchy Buys A Prominent Southern Paper

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
The family that owns The News & Observer of Raleigh, N.C., said yesterday that it had agreed to sell the newspaper, one of the few remaining larger independent dailies in the South, to McClatchy Newspapers Inc. of Sacramento, Calif., for $373 million.
McClatchy owns 12 dailies, including The Sacramento Bee and The Anchorage Daily News. It is known as a publisher of quality newspapers with a liberal political bent. 
 The News & Observer, which has been in the same family since it was bought by Josephus Daniels at a bankruptcy sale in 1894, was, until yesterday, one of the few family-owned papers that newspaper people thought might be able to buck the national trend of chain ownership.
Known in the 1960's as one of a handful of Southern newspapers that supported the civil-rights movement, the paper and the Daniels family have long had a reputation for integrity and aggressive journalism. For years, the paper's admiring nickname was The Raleigh Nuisance and Disturber.
In recent years, the paper has been known for one of the most sophisticated applications of technology in the industry. In a bittersweet emblem of the changing times for American newspapers, The News & Observer reported its own sale yesterday on its electronic "newspaper" on the Internet, The NandO Times. It is believed to be the first newspaper to deliver such news about itself digitally.
By midmorning yesterday, The NandO Times carried a color photograph of Frank Daniels 3d, the newspaper's 39-year-old executive editor and the great-grandson of Josephus Daniels, telling his reporters and editors about the sale of the News & Observer Publishing Company.
Frank Daniels Jr., the 63-year-old publisher, said no family divisions led to the sale. But he said company managers had concluded that the paper would probably not be able to remain in private hands during the next decade or so as the industry changed and the business passed to a fourth generation of the family.
To protect the paper as an institution, he said, family members had concluded that they would be better off selling to McClatchy, a newspaper company with similar political and journalistic traditions. "From a historical standpoint, sure I feel some sadness," the elder Mr. Daniels said. "But at the same time, I feel we're doing the right thing."
Mr. Daniels said he and many others in Raleigh recognized that the sale meant the end of a tradition that went back more than 100 years to his fiercely independent but partisan Democratic ancestor. Josephus Daniels, like many of his successors, won national prominence. He served as Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt served as his assistant secretary.
McClatchy will pay $250 million for the stock of the company and will assume $123 million in debt. Included in the sale are seven smaller publications in North Carolina owned by the company.
Frank Daniels Jr. will continue as publisher of The News & Observer. It was not clear what role his son might have at the paper, though he said he would like to remain.
With revenue of $107 million last year, the News & Observer company is much smaller than McClatchy, which had 1994 net income of $46.6 million on revenue of $471 million. Analysts said that McClatchy appeared to have paid generously, about 10 times what they estimated was the company's cash flow. Many publicly held newspaper companies trade at about seven times cash flow.
McClatchy, which went public in 1988, is controlled by descendants of James McClatchy, an Irish immigrant who worked for Horace Greeley at The New York Tribune and then went west during the Gold Rush. He acquired The Sacramento Bee in 1857.
Though McClatchy's stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, an ownership structure that includes two classes of stock has left effective control with the McClatchy family. Yesterday, McClatchy's class A shares closed at $23, down 25 cents.
Measured by daily circulation, McClatchy was the 17th-largest newspaper group in the country before the acquisition, according to the Newspaper Association of America. The Raleigh paper, with a daily circulation of 151,840, will not appreciably raise McClatchy's rank.
Still, analysts said The News & Observer was attractive partly because it is situated in a growing area. In addition, they said, The News & Observer's reputation for technological innovation would give McClatchy a solid base to move into electronic publishing.
Separately yesterday, McClatchy announced that James McClatchy, 74, who has been chairman since his brother, C. K. McClatchy died in 1989, was stepping down. He will stay a member of the board and retain his title as publisher of the company's newspapers. The company's chief executive, Erwin Potts, who is 63, will become chairman.
Mr. Potts said McClatchy had been drawn to The News & Observer mostly because it was a "good newspaper in a good market" and because it would permit McClatchy to be less reliant on the California economy, where most of its newspapers are situated.
Mr. Potts said the purchase was one of the biggest McClatchy had ever made, but he said he did not foresee a broad expansion.
"We have no interest in being a huge, big newspaper company," Mr. Potts said. "We've always wanted to be more quality minded than quantity minded."
Mr. Potts served on The News & Observer's board until March. Frank Daniels Jr. said he asked Mr. Potts not to attend a board meeting in March when the newspaper's operating committee suggested that the board might consider a possible sale, though there was no suitor at the time. Mr. Potts stepped down from the board.
Both men said Mr. Potts later expressed interest in buying the paper. Mr. Daniels said his family did not discuss a sale with any other companies and that McClatchy "came up with just enough money to keep us from going somewhere else."
The news of the sale surprised many in the industry. But some journalists at The News & Observer said they had heard that several years ago, a branch of the family had pressed for a buyout of their shares.
Frank Daniels 3d, said he was convinced that the paper needed a larger parent in part to give the paper the resources to nurture the new electronic efforts.
Asked if he was upset at the loss of the legacy of The News & Observer, the younger Mr. Daniels said, "It's been in the family 100 years and the identity that all of us have is intertwined with the newspaper. So there is some sadness there."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Steep First-Quarter Loss Tied To Revamping at Woolworth

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Woolworth Corporation reported a steep first-quarter loss yesterday as costs from an overhaul and sluggish consumer spending weighed down earnings.
Woolworth, the nation's ninth-largest retailer, lost $80 million, or 60 cents a share, up from a loss of $38 million, or 29 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter last year. Sales edged up to $1.79 billion from $1.76 billion. Wall Street had expected a loss of 27 cents a share, according to a survey of analysts by Zacks Investment Research. 
 Woolworth reported its earnings after the stock market closed. Earlier, shares of Woolworth rose 12.5 cents, to $15.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Many of the nation's leading retailers have reported disappointing first-quarter results as consumers, hit by rising interest rates and mounting credit card debt, have curbed spending.
Even the nation's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., reported on Tuesday that earnings rose 11 percent in the quarter, less than what Wall Street analysts had expected.
Woolworth, based in New York, said the results were in line with its expectations after accounting for costs for its restructuring. The company is selling underperforming divisions and getting rid of old, unsold inventory in its stores.
The retailer said the result included $38 million in costs related to inventory improvement programs. Minus those costs, the loss was in line with expectations, analysts said.
"On an operating basis, they were essentially fairly close to our projections," said Donald Trott, a retail analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds.
The chairman of Woolworth, Roger Farah, is working to pare down Woolworth's portfolio of nearly 40 store chains.
Since March, Mr. Farah has scrapped Woolworth's quarterly dividend, chopped capital spending budgets by 25 percent and disclosed plans to cut 2,000 workers -- all meant to save $100 million a year.
During the first quarter, Woolworth sold the Rx Place deep-discount drug chain and signed an agreement to sell the Little Folk/Kids Mart store chain.
These operations contributed a combined loss of $25 million in the first quarter, Woolworth said.
Some divisions were on the right track, Woolworth said. Its Athletic Footwear and Apparel division, including the Foot Locker chain, "turned in a particularly strong quarter," it said.

HEADLINE: Mexico Reports Economic Drop

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 17

 BODY:
The battered Mexican economy contracted by six-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter of 1995, a milder decline than expected, but the surprising figures may have more to do with the way the Government keeps records than any underlying strength in the economy.
In Mexico, quarterly figures are compared with the corresponding period a year earlier instead of the previous quarter as is done in the United States. By comparing the first three months since the peso was sharply devalued and huge amounts of capital left Mexico with the first three months of 1994 -- when the Mexican economy grew only seven-tenths of a percent because of the guerrilla uprising in Chiapas -- the effect of the current crisis was diminished. 
 Financial analysts also said that the figures for first quarter 1995 reflected a surge in sales that took place just before a large increase in the national value-added tax took effect in April.
Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz of Mexico said in Washington that he expected the Mexican economy to slow substantially in the second and third quarters.

G.O.P. Unity Fractures Just Beneath the Surface

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
Republicans in the House of Representatives have often seemed this year to be flying like the Blue Angels in perfect formation. But sometimes, on close inspection, the drill proves not to be as smooth as it first appears.
A case in point is a philosophical disagreement over tax policy between two of the most powerful committee chairmen -- John R. Kasich of Ohio, who heads the Budget Committee, and Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of Ways and Means. 
 This disagreement, which arose while Mr. Kasich's committee was constructing the framework that is supposed to lead to a balanced budget by the year 2002, was nowhere to be seen today as the House began debate on that budget resolution.
But the difference in the way the two chairmen think about taxes is so fundamental that it is likely to recur later this year when Congress addresses the details of how revenue will be raised and money spent.
It illustrates the underlying tension within the Republican Party between those who see themselves as leading a popular uprising against the establishment and others who have spent their careers defending the interests of American business.
Mr. Kasich, who is 43 and the son of a mailman from Western Pennsylvania, is an acolyte of Speaker Newt Gingrich and very much a leader of the uprising. His budget proposal, he said today during the House debate, provided "a revolutionary image and vision of where America should go."
If the party is serious about balancing the budget, he said in an interview in the lobby off the House floor, then all segments of society must contribute, and that includes an end to "corporate subsidies."
Mr. Archer, 67, is from the River Oaks section of Houston and represents one of the most affluent Congressional districts in the country. He has spent a quarter-century in the House fighting for tax breaks for oil and gas producers, banks, timber companies and other industries. These tax advantages, he holds, are essential to keep the industries profitable and the economy strong.
If you take away a tax deduction or credit, that is a tax increase, he said, adding: "My position is that as long as I'm chairman, we're not going to have a tax increase."
The disagreement between Mr. Kasich and Mr. Archer broke into the open early this month.
On May 3, as Republican members left Washington for a two-day retreat in Leesburg, Va., a document entitled "Corporate Welfare" was circulated on House Budget Committee stationery. On the bottom of the first page was this notation: "Draft House Republican Budget Committee Recommendations."
The first page proposed that $25 billion in additional revenue be raised over seven years by eliminating or modifying tax rules "that can be clearly identified as benefiting one industry or a limited number of corporations, derive no general public benefits, lack market justification and/or create a benefit far in excess of what is necessary to address a specific public policy concern."
The rest of the document listed six items that were said to fit that description including tax breaks Mr. Archer strongly favors for mineral depreciation, natural-gas production and timber development. Other proposals would have disallowed some deductions for advertising costs and increased taxes on international businesses.
Mr. Kasich says now that this was a internal document not meant for public dissemination. In most cases, Mr. Kasich's proposals were discussed with the committee chairmen whose programs would be affected, but the tax matters were never cleared with Mr. Archer.
"I didn't have time to do everything I wanted to do to have the most solid examples," Mr. Kasich said.
While the Republicans were in Leesburg, the tax document fell into the hands of corporate lobbyists, who flooded the conference site with faxes. Eventually, Mr. Archer gave a speech to his colleagues defending the tax breaks on the Kasich list one by one.
Mr. Archer was annoyed, he said, because Mr. Kasich and the Budget Committee staff clearly did not understand the ramifications of what was being proposed. "Once I explained to him how these things worked, he agreed with me," Mr. Archer said.
In any event, neither the $25 billion figure, the six examples nor the term "corporate welfare" appear in the report that accompanied the budget resolution Mr. Kasich brought to the House floor today.
The report, which is not binding on anyone, only offers "illustrative examples of inappropriate tax benefits that may be considered by the Committee on Ways and Means."
It then lists three minor tax measures that Mr. Archer agreed to include because, he said, they would prevent companies from using tax breaks in ways not intended by the law. These changes, if enacted, would raise negligible revenue.
But this is not the end of the disagreement between the chairmen. In part, that is because Republican leaders pay such close attention to public opinion polls, and the polls have found that the public detests "corporate welfare," a term apparently coined by Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich.
Frank Luntz, a pollster who is close to the Republican leaders and who regularly tests words and phrases for their political appeal, said the phrase was third in the list of "things the public flips out on." First, he said, is "foreign aid." Second is "waste, fraud and abuse."
As one concession to Mr. Archer's wing of the party, Mr. Kasich said he himself had stopped using the phrase "corporate welfare." Instead, he talks about "corporate subsidies" and says he is determined to get rid of them.
How does he define one?
"I know it when I see it," he said.
For his part, Mr. Archer said, "If there are subsidies out of the appropriations process that go to companies, then you have the question of whether they are justified. When you get to the tax code, I don't find subsidies in the code."

HEADLINE: Do-It-Yourself Deregulation;
Utilities Hustle to Cut Rates to Keep Big Businesses

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

DATELINE: BEDFORD, Mass.

 BODY:
The Raytheon Company wants cheaper electricity and has threatened to go outside Massachusetts to get it. But with the winds of deregulation sweeping through the nation's utility industry, it probably won't have to.
"I can shop for my transportation, my heating oil, my telephone service, but for electricity costs we can't," complained William H. Swanson, an executive vice president at Raytheon, which is based in Lexington and employs 19,500 people in the state. "We're like sheep." 
 Maybe once, but no longer. Mr. Swanson, who said other states have been wooing the big military contractor with the promise of inexpensive energy, has banded together with other business interests and some consumers to lobby for an end to utility monopolies in Massachusetts. And their efforts are paying off: The state is considering a proposal to allow major corporate customers to bypass their local utilities and shop around for cheaper power from competitors.
But even before that can happen, the big industrial users are forcing some utilities to practice what might be called do-it-yourself deregulation. In fact, the very utilities that used to resist rate cuts or any other concessions to customers are now caving in to protect their turf. Boston Edison, for example, got regulatory approval in March to cut rates up to 20 percent for big industrial users that are able to show they would otherwise move jobs out of state.
The drama being played out in Massachusetts is repeating itself across the nation as utilities ready themselves for the inevitable: the deregulation of their industry.
California led the way with a proposal last summer to let utilities compete for customers, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a sweeping plan last month to force utilities to open their transmission systems to competitors. After several delays, California regulators next week are expected to outline a somewhat scaled-back blueprint for opening the power business to competition.
Other states are also beginning to take the first steps on how to modify the monopolies that their utilities have long enjoyed.
Still, while deregulation is in its infancy, many utilities are not waiting. As more and more corporations and other big energy users put pressure on Federal and state authorities to loosen restrictions, they are positioning themselves to survive in what promises to be a fiercely competitive environment.
Their basic strategy is to give price breaks to keep big industrial users that might otherwise move elsewhere or, after deregulation, buy elsewhere. Many are hoping to make up for the loss of revenue by cutting expenses. But others fear that won't be enough, raising the prospect that they might pass the cost onto small businesses and home owners who lack political clout.
"Everyone is willing to dump the costs on somebody else," said Robert D. Glynn, the president and chief executive of Pacific Gas and Electric Company in San Francisco, the nation's largest investor-owned utility.
Mr. Glynn said pressure from industrial customers had replaced regulation as the main force for change in his state, whose economy has been hurt by cutbacks in Federal military spending.
While California authorities remain divided on how to proceed with their deregulation proposal, for example, Pacific Gas and Electric in 1994 decided to freeze its rates for all customers for five years. It has also cut the cost of power to its largest industrial users by about $70 million a year since 1994 in an effort to help preserve jobs.
"The regulators have become a secondary force," Mr. Glynn said. "The market and the state's economy have become the primary forces in having us lower our prices."
Other utilities, such as Detroit Edison, have given big discounts to the major auto makers in return for long-term contracts. The contracts are aimed both at keeping the companies in Michigan and in Edison's grip.
And at least one electricity provider has actually gone the distance and agreed to do what California wants its utilities to do. Cinergy, a utility that serves most of Indiana and Cincinnati, is allowing major customers such as Nucor, a major steel producer using vast amounts of power to run its electric arc furnaces, to begin shopping for some of its power from other utilities and producers.
Nucor can go to competitors for power that it needs after it reaches a certain level of use from the utility, which can match the price if it chooses. If the power Nucor finds is cheaper, then Cinergy transmits that power over its system.
The utility industry's new-found flexibility is a windfall for big businesses trying to cut costs. "Now is a good time to get a good deal," said Dan N. Bulla, the director of financial and public relations for Houston Industries, a major utility in Texas.
But the danger is that small users might get the short end of the stick. Stockholders, too, might suffer as utilities' profits shrink.
If the loss of revenue becomes large enough, utilities will have no choice but to phase out high-cost plants, which in many cases means nuclear plants, and take huge write-offs that could depress stock prices and endanger dividends.
And some of them are fighting back. In Massachusetts, for example, local consumer groups and some environmental groups have sprung into action to make sure that no group is left holding the bag.
Armond Cohen, a lawyer with the Conservation Law Foundation in Boston, worried that utilities would cut corners on conservation to make up for lost profits. Already, he said, some utilities have begun scaling back programs to make plants and office buildings more energy-efficient. "If we just listen to Raytheon we'll get it all wrong," Mr. Cohen said.
The pressure for deregulation keeps building, though, as states jockey to attract industry with promises of cheap energy. The Nucor Steel Corporation was recently the object of a bidding war between Virginia and South Carolina, for example.
For a time F. Kenneth Iverson, Nucor's chief executive, said he was leaning to Virginia for the location of a new $500 million steel mill because the local utility, Virginia Power, was offering lower rates to big industrial customers. The concession was important because the plant's projected energy costs will total $25 million a year, Mr. Iverson said.
The Legislature of South Carolina countered by authorizing Santee Cooper, the state-owned utility, to match Virginia's rates, Mr. Iverson said. Other factors made South Carolina more desirable to him, he said, and so he chose that state.
Both states coveted the 500 jobs that the Nucor plant would provide. It was that obsession with jobs that explained Raytheon's success in getting its message across to the Massachusetts political establishment: It employs 19,500 people in the state and said it might have to move some of its plants elsewhere unless it could cut projected spending on taxes, labor and energy by $600 million a year.
Massachusetts, which saw hundreds of thousands of jobs, many of them with well-paying military contractors, disappear in the early 1990's, is desperate to keep Raytheon. And Mr. Swanson, the company's executive vice president, is keeping the pressure on state authorities.
He said pointedly that he had been wined and dined by the Governor of Tennessee and wooed by development officials from states all over the South and West. "They're proud of their low power costs," he said in an interview. "It seems we're being approached by everyone in the world right now."
Stumping the state like a politician, Mr. Swanson has built a coalition of other companies, industry groups, energy suppliers and residents to lobby for opening up the Massachusetts electricity market.
His activities have made headlines and prodded politicians. Recently, three state senators toured a Raytheon plant in Andover, Mass., that uses large amounts of energy to test military equipment at a cost of almost 7 cents a kilowatt-hour. That is nearly twice as much as the company spends at its plant in Tennessee. The plant, Raytheon's largest, employs 5,100 workers.
Officials at the Department of Public Utilities, which regulates the industry, said the agency planned to issue a proposal for allowing energy users to shop around -- a process known as "retail wheeling" -- by this summer.
"We're at a crossroads," said Gloria Cordes Larson , the Secretary of Economic Affairs for Massachusetts. "We need to do something to change the rules."
It won't be easy. Utilities in the New England states get about 36 percent of their power from high-cost nuclear plants that would no longer be able to compete in an open market and would have to be phased out. The struggle over who would pay for the huge costs of shutdowns could delay deregulation.
But the jobs issue is forcing the pace. And that has Mr. Swanson looking forward to action. "This," he says, "is the year of decision."

A kilowatt is the same everywhere, but its price tag varies widely enough to prompt some manufacturers to relocate to low-rate regions - or use a threat to do so to extract discounts for staying put. Here is the average cost of electricity supplies to industrial customers by commercial utilities in each region in 1993, the latest available. (Source: Edison Electric Institute)

HEADLINE: Stocks End Mixed, but Technology Issues Continue Their Rise

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market closed mixed yesterday, but high-technology stocks continued to rally.
Prices mostly fell in the afternoon, but recovered somewhat by the session's end. Traders exercised some options in advance of Friday's "double witching" session, when two kinds of quarterly stock options expire. 
 Such expirations once led to wild gyrations at the week's end. But now many traders use these options to buy or sell stocks throughout the week of expiration, lessening the volatility.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.45 points, to 4,422.60, and the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 1.12 points, to 527.07. But the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index moved in the opposite direction, rising 3.68 points, to 871.93, a new high. And the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.14 point, to 489.52, also a new high.
Thomas Gallagher, vice chairman and head of equity and fixed-income trading at Oppenheimer & Company, said he was not surprised at the minor decline in the prices of blue-chip stocks, especially in view of Friday's options expiration.
"But will there be a time when people start taking a lot of money off the table?" Mr. Gallagher asked. "I don't know. What I do know is that unless you see technology stocks declining, these declines that you see in the afternoon are not going to be significant."
Still, said James Solloway, director of research at Argus Research, "this bull is definitely due for a rest." Just when, Mr. Solloway was not willing to predict.
Inflation might be tame, the Federal Reserve could cut rates and corporate earnings might keep growing, Mr. Solloway said. "But there's a contradiction at the heart of many investors' outlook," he said. "They hope for a pickup in economic growth in the second half of the year, but that can't coexist with stable inflation and lower interest rates."
Technology stocks led the market yesterday, as they have in recent sessions, and Applied Materials Inc. led the technology stocks. The company, a maker of equipment that assists in the manufacture of computer chips, rose 1133/64 , to 8017/64 . After the market closed on Tuesday, Applied Materials reported a 70 percent rise in earnings to $1.08 a share that far exceeded analysts' expectations. At more than 8 million shares traded, the stock was yesterday's most active.
Other technology stocks, especially those of computer-related companies, also rose. Shares of the Intel Corporation advanced 1 7/8, to 110 3/4; those of the Compaq Computer Corporation rose 1 1/4, to 40, and those of the Microsoft Corporation closed at 86, up 1 1/8. Shares of EIP Microwave Inc., which makes telecommunications test instruments, rose 4 1/2, to 9 1/4, after the company reported strong earnings on Tuesday.
Among declining stocks were seven out of nine members of the S.& P. local-telephone group. Shares of SBC Communications Inc. fell 1 1/4, to 43 1/2, and those of the Bell Atlantic Corporation fell 1 1/8, to 53 3/4, in large part because the Pacific Telesis Group's poor earnings outlook cast doubt on the ability of such carriers to compete when local phone service is deregulated.
Eighteen of the Dow industrials' 30 component stocks fell, led by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, which declined 1 1/4 a share, to 60 1/4. Of the S.& P. 500's component stocks, 266 fell, led by SBC Communications and Motorola Inc., which lost 1, to 60 1/8.

HEADLINE: This Time, New York City Is All Alone

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
When Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani summoned a dozen business and labor leaders to City Hall this week, hoping they could persuade Albany to save his teetering budget, the meeting immediately recalled memories of a similar coalition that helped rescue the city from bankruptcy in the 1970's.
But where the old coalition found a receptive ear in Albany 20 years ago, the new one can barely find an open door. Suddenly, the state has empty pockets of its own, and the big brother who stepped in to pull New York City from the brink in 1975 is in no position to help solve Fiscal Crisis II. 
 If Mr. Giuliani's budget does unravel because of a huge shortfall in state assistance, it will partly be the result of a lobbying strategy that impressed neither Democrats who might have provided financial aid nor Republicans who might have helped cut welfare and Medicaid benefits. But in a larger sense, it will have been a casualty to statewide and national fiscal pressures even greater than those that humbled the city two decades ago, according to several of the officials who dealt with the first fiscal crisis.
Felix G. Rohatyn, who as chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, was a key architect of the city's bailout in the 1970's, recalled that the state was flush with cash then and willing to give some to the city in exchange for firm cost controls. Now, however, the state's financial condition may be even worse than the city's, he noted, and the sour political atmosphere that pervades the capital makes compromise vastly more difficult. The city's budget gap is about $3.1 billion; the state's is as much as $5 billion.
"I think the overall situation the Mayor faces is very dire," Mr. Rohatyn said. "It's always dangerous to predict doomsday scenarios, but it does seem that this is as serious a situation as I've seen since 1975, and in some ways it's even more difficult."
Mr. Rohatyn said Mr. Giuliani has a much tougher job today than Mayor Abraham D. Beame had in 1975 because "no one has the political power to help him," he said.
Richard Ravitch, former chairman of the State Urban Development Corporation, who was also deeply involved in the city's 1975 bailout, said the absence of an immediate credit crunch has made it difficult for the state to recognize the intensity of the city's current problems.
"The glue that binds us all together is the severity of the city's fiscal problems," he said, referring to the members of the new business and labor coalition on which he was asked to serve. "You can't let the city get into the hole that it was once in again. That would be an utter and complete disaster."
In many ways, the city's house is in better order than it was 20 years ago. Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, notes that the city has for the most part ended its destructive practice of paying for long-term building projects with short-term revenue, and is doing a much better job of collecting tax revenue. But having eliminated many of the problems that led to the first crisis, he said, the city will experience the impact of the new crisis in a different way: not as a credit squeeze heading toward bankruptcy but as an immensely painful reduction in city services and city optimism.
"What will be worse than 1975 will be the service impact of all the cuts," he said. "This isn't an imaginary numbers game here like it used to be. These are real people who are going to get hurt unless we find some transitional way of getting out of here."
Mr. Giuliani has steadfastly denied that his budget would produce painful reductions in services -- if the state simply agreed to his plan for cutting the city's bloated welfare and Medicaid system and if he is allowed to flatten the bureaucracy at the city's Board of Education and elsewhere.
But with the board still out of his reach, and the Assembly Democrats in Albany blocking his request, the Mayor is getting worried. Not only did he ask the business and labor coalition to help, but in its letter to Albany he also allowed the coalition to back away from his insistence that $700 million of the $950 million in requested state aid be in cuts for entitlement programs. In effect, the letter was a rather desperate-sounding plea for nearly a billion dollars -- in whatever form the state decided to provide it.
Now that the plea seems likely to be denied, there are other options for achieving fiscal balance that do not necessarily involve the state. Mr. Rohatyn, for example, said the business community needs to shoulder its share of sacrifice, much as the labor and welfare communities are being asked to bear theirs. He suggested the Mayor ask for a four-year moratorium on big-business moves out of the city as a sign of their commitment. He also recommended increasing the property tax burden on single-family homes and placing tolls on the East River bridges.
"People only recognize an emergency when they're hit in the face with it, and that's what's about to happen here," he said. "The state has to come to the same conclusion that it did in the 1970's, which is that without a healthy city economy, the state will be sick, too."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Car Buyers Play a Game Of Beating The Tariff

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD, N.J., May 17

 BODY:
For the last several months, Mary and Jim Pagiatakis had been thinking about trading in their 1992 Lexus for a shiny new one. Today they went out and did it.
They hurried to Lexus of Englewood to pick out a four-door LS400: color, diamond white pearl; sticker price, $56,550. A bargain, they said. 
 The car was sitting in the middle of the showroom, free of the Clinton Administration's 100 percent tariff, which was announced on Tuesday and is scheduled to start on Saturday for imported LS400's and 12 other Japanese-made luxury car models. The duty could eventually push the price of the top-of-the-line Lexus LS400 model to more than $80,000.
The sanctions may be rescinded if Japan and the United States reach an accord by June 28 on their longstanding dispute about trade in autos. And at least for now Toyota and some other Japanese auto makers say they will not pass on the higher tariff to their dealers and customers. Still, the Pagiatakis decided they did not want to run the risk.
"This more or less pushed us into it," Mr. Pagiatakis said. "This got us acting."
Business has been snappy at Lexus of Englewood and other dealers of Japanese luxury cars around the country since the reports began circulating in the news media and elsewhere about the impending tariff. In Dallas, Carl Sewell, owner of Sewell Lexus, said his sales had increased by about 30 percent in the last week.
"Customers wisely decided to purchase a new car before the prices rise," Mr. Sewell said. Looking forward to the possible huge increase in price, he added, only partly tongue-in-cheek, "It looks like we're going to have a half-price sale this weekend."
At Lexus of Englewood, Richard Karsian, general manager of the dealership, said he had sold 26 new cars on Monday and Tuesday. Four more went out the door today. That is normally a week's worth of sales, he said.
Those sales, Mr. Karsian said, have reduced his stock of 1995 Lexuses to 81. The company, which is owned by Toyota, has promised him 70 more by the end of the week, all duty-free, he said.
But beneath the talk of brisk sales, scores of anxious Lexus owners are calling in with all sorts of questions, many of which are unanswerable now. And some of the salesmen at the luxury dealership in this suburb of New York City, in Bergen County, are fighting a doomsday mood.
"In the short run the tariff will have a good effect on business," said one, who insisted on anonymity. "In the long run it could be totally devastating." Cars now in the country and tariff-free will be "gobbled up" he said. "But as far as a career goes, it looks like my career could end soon."
The murkiness centers on the future for Lexus and the makers of the other imported luxury cars if the White House goes ahead with the sanctions on the June 28 deadline, retroactive to May 20. Some of the calls to the Lexus showroom here have come from buyers hoping to buy before the tariff is imposed. But other callers have questioned whether the dealership would be around to provide service and repairs if the sanctions remained in effect for a long time.
Mr. Karsian sought to sound reassuring today on some points. He said Lexus had "ample parts -- parts to last the next few years" already available in the United States. And he said his dealership would not increase prices for new Lexuses in stock, even though the demand may exceed the supply.
Current Lexus owners might enjoy a windfall. Mr. Karsian predicted that sales of used Lexus models should be very strong if the tariff remained in place. "The value of those cars will remain very high," he said.
The American sanctions have thrown the marketing plans of the Japanese luxury car makers into turmoil. While some importers are holding fire for now, Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., which imports five Lexus models -- all affected by the tariff -- plans to run newspaper advertisements on Thursday in six cities across the country that are strong sales markets. The ads are expected to run in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco and New York.
In Torrance, Calif., the national sales and marketing manager for Lexus, Richard Anderman, said the ads were designed to assure car buyers that business was proceeding as usual at local Lexus dealerships. The cars remain available at regular prices, he said.
"What this is really doing is causing uncertainty," said Mike Sullivan, owner of Lexus Santa Monica in Southern California. "Any time you have uncertainty in this business, it's bad."
Mr. Sullivan said some customers were asking about the tariff and the likely impact on prices. But he said he did not anticipate a big rush of new customers. "We are seeing some people accelerate their purchases," he said, "but really those are people who were going to buy the car anyway."
Indeed, many of those who have been thinking about acquiring a new Japanese luxury car are not wasting any time. At another dealership, Infiniti by Kea in Englewood, Linda Gellman hurried in from her home in Nanuet, N.Y., just across the state line in Rockland County. She leased a 1995 Q45, a top-of-the-line model from the luxury division of Nissan, with a base price of $52,850 and a 100 percent tariff in its future.
Like the Pagiatakis, Mrs. Gellman was also motivated by the tariff threat. "We were going to wait a couple of weeks until our old lease was up," she said. "But I'm rushing to do it now because I don't know what's going to happen."
There are still a number of unanswered questions. What about the price of imported luxury cars that customers have ordered, but which will arrive by boat from Japan after May 20, or after June 28 if the tariff becomes a reality then?
Mr. Karsian, the Lexus dealer, produced a newsletter from the American International Auto Dealers Association that echoed what Toyota was saying about the immediate future. "Dealers and customers are not responsible for paying any retroactive duties due," the newsletter said.
But the newsletter did not address the issue of who would be socked with any tariff that might be due if they remained in effect after June 28.
"I hope it doesn't go that far," Mr. Karsian said. "We support a settlement. When all the dust settles the only ones hurt will be the dealers. It certainly isn't going to affect the Japanese economy to any large degree."

Bond Prices Are Mixed In Slow Day Of Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities were mixed in an uninspired trading session yesterday, with most longer maturities lower in price.
Renewed optimism about slow economic growth and low inflation kept market sentiment leaning toward the positive. But rates were bounced around by speculation that foreign central banks were selling Government securities that they had amassed this year, after they acquired dollars seeking to support the United States currency when it was falling against the Japanese yen and German mark. 
 Traders said some investors sold to lock in profits yesterday, after the yield on the long bond fell to 6.80 percent. Still, there was a general lack of enthusiasm in all directions.
"The inability of the market to hold onto overnight gains was slightly worrisome," said James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International, a market analysis and research firm in San Francisco, suggesting that the market might be running out of reasons to justify buying.
Dealers said they saw the market as overbought, but acknowledged that few were fighting the trend.
The price of the 30-year bond slipped 1/32 , to 10920/32 , for a yield of 6.86 percent, unchanged from the previous day.
Mr. Hale said the activity of the market fizzled after early strength carried over from overnight trading by overseas investors who may have been moving more money into dollar-denominated investments.
Even next week's supply of paper and a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee failed to serve as inspirations for trading, Mr. Hale said.
As for the market yesterday, Mr. Hale said, "it seems that from the way the market is behaving, U.S. investors think we are reaching overbought positions, but foreign investors who like the recent stability of the dollar are leaning toward Treasury securities as an attractive investment." He said he did not expect yields to go much lower.
The Treasury said yesterday that it would auction $29.25 billion of new two- and five-year notes next week to refund maturing debt and raise new cash. In when-issued trading, the two-year issue being sold on Tuesday was offered at a price to yield 6.13 percent, and the five-year issue was offered at a price to yield 6.37 percent.
The two- and five-year notes, which will be issued on May 31, will be sold in minimum denominations of $5,000 and $1,000, respectively, and mature on May 31, 1997, and May 31, 2000.
In the municipal bond market, investors continued to find tax-exempt securities attractive. The average yield to maturity for the Bond Buyer's index of 40 municipal issues was 6.10 percent, down two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, from Tuesday.
Traders said the yields on Treasury bonds had tumbled to 14-month lows, but tax-exempt bonds had lagged behind the benchmark Treasuries, narrowing the yield differential and making municipals more attractive.
In another development, the Tennessee Valley Authority said it was preparing its first global bond issue, to appeal to international investors.
The authority said it would visit investors in the large international financial centers of Europe and Asia beginning June 5.
The bonds are expected to be listed on the exchanges in Luxembourg, Hong Kong and Singapore and on the New York Stock Exchange.
The lead manager on the global bond deal will be Lehman Brothers, with Deutsche Bank as the joint lead manager.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Recovers After Retreat Vs. Mark and Is Little Changed

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar ended little changed yesterday, recovering from an early fall against the German mark that stemmed from worries about whether the new French Government would maintain a strong franc policy.
That concern bolstered the mark against both the French franc and the dollar. The dollar typically declines when dealers sell currencies to buy marks. 
 But the franc and the dollar recovered against the mark after a spokeswoman for President Jacques Chirac of France said rumors that the franc would be devalued were "absurd."
"The comments that devaluation isn't in the cards helped the dollar come back," said Hillel Waxman, manager of currency trading at the Bank Leumi Trust Company in New York.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.4441 marks, up from 1.4429 on Tuesday. The dollar edged up to 86.80 yen from 86.57. Also in New York, the mark was quoted at 3.5372 French francs, down from an early high of 3.5655 francs but up from 3.5373 franc yesterday.
Mr. Chirac took over today from Francois Mitterrand. Mr. Chirac's pledge to cut France's 12.2 percent unemployment rate has led some analysts to speculate that he will abandon the previous Government's strong franc policy.
"He is committed to reducing unemployment, which speaks against" a strong franc policy, said David Ogg, manager of foreign exchange at the Midland Bank in New York. That pushed the mark up against the franc, he said.
Moves to cut French unemployment could hurt the franc if they include an expanded budget deficit and lower interest rates, which make bank deposits denominated in a currency less attractive.
Traders' worries about Mr. Chirac's currency policy were heightened after Le Monde reported that he might seek to devalue the franc within the European monetary system. The system's exchange rate mechanism prescribes bands within which nine European currencies trade.
The Le Monde article said "some of Chirac's backers" want him to propose a redesign of the monetary system in his meeting today with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany.
As for the dollar, Marc Chandler, currency strategist at the Deutsche Bank in New York, said he expected it would resume a rally that has lifted it 6 percent against the mark and 4 percent against the yen since May 8.

A cut in deposit insurance rates may be a boon for bank stocks.

BYLINE: By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
THE Federal Government says it is about to get off the backs of American banks, and that could prove to be a boon for investors in bank stocks and perhaps even for banks' customers.
The Government agency involved is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures the money that customers keep in their bank accounts. The insurance is not free -- banks pay for it, on a sliding scale ranging from 23 cents to 31 cents for each $100 of deposits. 
 Though 92 percent of banks pay the lowest rate, the agency says, those charges are still historically high, the result of the problems that financial institutions ran into in the late 1980's. (Remember the banking crisis?) The money thus raised has piled up in a reserve fund and now tops $24 billion.
And that may be just about enough. The law says the reserve fund should equal 1.25 percent of all the insured deposits, which total about $1.9 trillion, said David Barr, a spokesman for the F.D.I.C. At the end of March the reserve fund was at about 1.21 percent, and sometime between now and July 31 it will reach the legal level.
So when the board of the F.D.I.C. finishes its review of comments from the banking industry and meets sometime this month or next, it plans to cut the insurance rates by more than 80 percent. The average fee will fall to about 4.5 cents from about 23 cents, Mr. Barr said. The cut will probably take effect before the fourth quarter of the year, and banks may be eligible for rebates on some of their third-quarter payments.
"This is the most important bank regulatory event in years," said Michael L. Mayo, an analyst for Lehman Brothers. Because it will have "a direct, meaningful impact on earnings," he added, the change is even more significant than current Congressional efforts to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that limits the businesses into which banks can go.
As Mr. Mayo sees it, lower insurance charges should translate into gains in earnings averaging 6 percent next year, and might increase the earnings this year by 2 percent. Though some banks will benefit more than others, "this is a rising tide that's going to lift all ships," he said.
A slightly more conservative view comes from James K. Schmidt, who manages mutual funds specializing in bank stocks for John Hancock in Boston. He says banks' earnings will gain by about 4 percent, because banks may use some of the money that used to go for insurance to increase the rates they pay on customers' checking and savings accounts.
Still, he said, "that's a permanent increase." And while the stock market may be "psychologically aware" that this gain in earnings is on the way, he said, analysts are just starting to reflect it in their estimates of future earnings.
That is true of Mr. Mayo, who said he had just raised his estimate of earnings for Nationsbank, one of his favorite stocks. He now expects the bank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., but does business in many Southern states, to earn $6.95 this year, up from his earlier estimate of $6.85. Next year, he said, the bank should earn $7.70; of the increase of 30 cents in his estimate of earnings, 20 cents comes from the lower F.D.I.C. rates.
Investors who want to bet on the improved earnings of banks may be put off by the fact that bank stocks are trading at record levels right now. Indeed, the Nasdaq index of bank stocks has soared by about 16 percent this year, while the Dow Jones industrial average has gained about 15 percent and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index has risen by almost 15 percent.
But bank stocks still have some things going for them. As Mr. Schmidt, the fund manager, noted, compared with their earnings, bank stocks are relatively less expensive than those in most sectors of the market. The average ratio of banks' stock prices to their earnings is about 9.5, he said, while the same ratio for the stocks in the S.& P. 500 is about 15.5.
Banks are also paying higher dividends than many other companies, said Mr. Mayo, the analyst. And their dividends are likely to rise by an average of 15 percent this year, leading him to suggest that despite their recent gains, "banks are nice, defensive stocks."
Even some confirmed bargain hunters say they are still hitting pay dirt by investing in banks. For example, Scott M. Black of Delphi Management in Boston, said, "there are still some great values" among small banks with strong managements that are trading for about eight times earnings.
And if analysts are right, the price cut by the F.D.I.C. will affect little, out-of-the-way -- and cheap -- banks just as much as their bigger, better-known brethren.

Iran Tells OPEC Nations Not to Lift Output

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, May 17

 BODY:
Iran's oil minister warned today that his country would retaliate against other members of OPEC if they took advantage of a United States trade ban by increasing their own oil production.
In an interview with a small group of foreign journalists, the minister, Gholamreza Agazadeh, also acknowledged that the trade ban would cause some short-term disruption for Iran's oil exports. 
 Under the trade ban announced by President Clinton earlier this month, American oil companies can no longer buy Iranian oil for sale to countries outside the United States. Last year, these countries bought about $3.5 billion of Iran's oil.
Iran is concerned that while it is making alternative arrangements with other oil companies to deliver its oil abroad, other oil producing countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, will keep their own marketing networks and add Iran's American trading partners as well.
Since the ban would cause a "redistribution of markets," other countries might choose to increase their output, Mr. Agazadeh said. Iran and the 11 other member nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed in November to extend ceilings on oil production for another 12 months in an effort to support the price of crude. Still, past production agreements have been undermined at times by cheating by members.
While Mr. Agazadeh denied he was threatening any OPEC member, his remarks were clearly aimed at sending a clear signal to the international oil market that Iran had no intention of being a victim of the American trade ban.
The oil minister said Iran would not do anything to reduce the price of oil. "But if I see that other producers are going to change their policy, maybe we will choose another policy too," he said. "I'm not telling specifically we are going to raise our output. I'm only saying if others raise their output, N.I.O.C. will modify its behavior," referring to the National Iranian Oil Company.
Despite claims by other Iranian officials that the American trade ban would have no effect on Iran, Mr. Agazadeh acknowledged that in the near future it would force Iran to replace some of its fixed contracts with more volatile transactions on the spot oil market. He boasted that Iran had markets around the world that could eventually absorb its oil, but added, "In the short term, it takes us some time to pass through this transition."
Mr. Agazadeh sharply criticized the Clinton Administration's cancellation in March of Iran's $1 billion agreement with Conoco, a unit of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, to develop two oilfields 80 miles off the Iranian coast.
He called the American companies "hostage to the policies of their Government" and said that he hoped to "reach some tangible results" in the next several weeks with another company. He declined to say which companies were serious contenders for the project, although Total, Elf Aquitaine, Royal Dutch/Shelland Petronas are all believed to be negotiating with the Iranians.

The right's knee-jerk reaction: Fed hopeful is a knee-jerk liberal.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
HELP WANTED: Centrist economic policy maker. Modest salary, but substantial power, prestige and perks. Ability to stay awake at long meetings a must.
The White House thought it had come up with an ideal candidate for the current opening on the Federal Reserve's seven-member board of governors. She is Alicia H. Munnell, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, who had earlier worked her way up the through the ranks to become a senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. 
 But for reasons not entirely clear, torpedoing the appointment is becoming a right-wing cause. The question now is whether President Clinton will actually submit her name. Or he may duck another confirmation fight where, in the words of Herb Stein, an economic adviser to President Richard M. Nixon (and no liberal), "the opposition is based on irrelevancies"
Ms. Munnell is no shrinking violet, but she has not been particularly controversy-prone. After earning a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1973, her public face has largely consisted of scholarly books and articles about retirement policy, tax reform and investment in public works.
Once in Washington, she dutifully adopted the Treasury's traditional role of prudent parent to the unruly adolescents making waves at Federal agencies with their own special-interest constituencies. She fought environmental hard-liners on Superfund, arguing for streamlined procedures to clean up toxic wastes. She beat back apparatchiks in the Labor Department who wanted private pension funds to make "socially useful investment." Most important in the context of the Fed job, she helped mute White House criticism of the central bank's anti-inflation policy.
Nonetheless, Paul Craig Roberts, a syndicated columnist who briefly led the "supply-siders" in the Reagan Administration, began crusading against her last fall, choosing to make Ms. Munnell the Clinton Administration's poster girl for Big Government. And last week a Wall Street Journal editorial denounced her as "an economist with ideas on the fiscal fringe."
Since then, 10 Republican Senators, including Phil Gramm, a Presidential contender, wrote to Mr. Clinton. They urged him to give the Fed job to someone with "a keen eye toward the stability of our currency and the importance of keeping our capital markets free from burdensome regulations, taxes and mandates." If there was any doubt what they meant, Senator Connie Mack of Florida sent along a press release alluding to Ms. Munnell's alleged heresies.
What is going on here? The Wall Street Journal editorial lumped her with liberals who want to tap pension cash for low-income housing and regional development. In fact, her own analysis of social investing -- published in the New England Economic Review -- concluded that this approach to investing was "alarming" because pensioners would bear the risk.
Another beef with Ms. Munnell's views concerns the tax treatment of pensions. She noted in an article in the National Tax Journal that deferral of taxes on employer-sponsored pensions cost the Treasury $51 billion in revenues in 1992. Yet only half the population benefits, with much of the break going to upper-income families. And in Ms. Munnell's reading of the numbers, the net addition to private savings is offset by the negative impact on public savings through the Federal budget. Her suggestion: tax the income accruing in sheltered pension funds.
That recommendation may be anathema to members of Congress who have never met a tax expenditure they didn't like. But in Mr. Stein's view, it is an "entirely reasonable point" to weigh the adverse impact on income distribution against the positive incentives to save. And, while controversial, it is hardly radical economics.
What, then, is really eating Ms. Munnell's critics? Probably not her attitude toward the Fed's core task of sustaining a healthy, low-inflation economy. For one thing, there is no hint that she disagrees with the semitough approach to monetary policy now in place. For another, her most vociferous critics are supply-siders who think the Fed is already too tough on inflation.
A more plausible explanation is that the banking industry still quietly blames her for the Boston Fed's study finding racial discrimination in lending. If that is the case, however, the bankers may be directing their ire at the wrong target. Indeed, while the Justice Department is trying to use civil rights laws to force banks to set up branches in poor neighborhoods where blacks are concentrated, the Boston Fed merely called for vigilance and better training for loan officers.
The very idea that a candidate with Ms. Munnell's credentials is fodder for a fight suggests just how vulnerable President Clinton must appear to Republicans. It may behoove him to fight, if only to demonstrate that appearances deceive.

HEADLINE: U.S. Can't Afford Economic Equality for All

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your May 11 front page contains the perfect example of one of the major contributors to our Government's fiscal problems. Representative Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota is reported as saying that society's central problem is the gulf between the very rich and very poor. The policies that have been enacted to close this gap are the very entitlement programs that Congress is now attempting to rein in because of their extravagant costs. 
 Opinions like that of Mr. Sabo have led to the socialistic policies that have burdened not only our Government but future generations and have contributed to the multitrillion-dollar debt.
It is the nature of capitalistic societies that all individuals are not at the same socioeconomic level. Other governments have attempted to legislate a different result, and their collapse was recent enough to remain in my memory, if not Mr. Sabo's. I would love to live in a large mansion, but I can't afford it. Our nation cannot afford the policies necessary to drag all people to the same economic status, or even close, assuming that would be a good thing.
It is amazing that Mr. Sabo wants to spend more, while our cumulative tax rates already approach 50 percent of our income. I don't want to pay any more to our Government. My family pays more than enough.
It is amazing that even in the grip of a financial crisis so extreme that politicians are considering cuts in Medicare (the sacred cow of the American Association of Retired Persons) that Mr. Sabo has yet to understand that it is socialistic wealth-redistributing policies, along with the deficit spending they demanded, that have dragged us to the point where we cannot afford them.
And it is politicians like Mr. Sabo who, while perhaps well meaning, allow socialistic policies to continue and even expand, continuing their financial drag on our economy.
Since the Johnson Administration our Government has been spending more than it takes in, and we can no longer afford that luxury. Maybe, just maybe, Mr. Sabo will realize that American citizens would appreciate a little bit of financial accountability when he deals with our money.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Estimated Budget Conservatively

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "A Budget Harsher Than It Seems" (editorial, May 16): My Republican colleagues and I strongly take issue with your contention that our budget proposal contains "rosy projections of savings and revenues that may never materialize." Just the opposite is true because we believe our numbers are, if anything, too conservative. 
 You state that "many economists are uneasy" about Congressional Budget Office estimates that reaching a balanced budget by 2002 will result in saving some $50 billion in lower interest payments. To which economists do you refer? Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, says that such action would result in a 2 percentage point drop in long-term rates. We have factored in a conservative 1.5 percentage point drop.
Since last November's election, the Republican promise of a balanced budget has already had an impact on long-term rates: they've fallen from more than 8 percent to 6.9 percent. It is more than coincidence that the decline in rates accelerated as the budget committee announced and then approved its balanced budget plan last week.
The 0.2 percent adjustment in the Consumer Price Index you support, as opposed to our 0.6 percent figure, will result from a simple recalculation based on existing formulas. From Mr. Greenspan to Alice Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budget, economists have argued that the C.P.I. now significantly overstates inflation and that the formulas should be reworked.
There is no confusion about the $7.5 billion in savings from the elimination of loopholes slated for the year 2002. The budget committee's reconciliation instructions will be clear: either by closing tax loopholes or through other measures, the savings will be enforced.
We have gone to great pains to be accurate as we put our budget together. If there was even slight doubt about our numbers, we chose in every case to be conservative. The Congressional Budget Office scored them conservatively. If our numbers are imprudent, as you claim, it is only because we underestimate the savings they will generate.

HEADLINE: The $100,000 Lexus

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's desire to pry open Japan's closed automobile market is understandable. But President Clinton's decision to impose 100 percent tariffs on Lexus, Infiniti and other luxury imports is mistaken and unnecessary. It seems designed more to mend the President's relations with American unions than to resolve trade differences with Japan.
American sanctions violate the trade accord that the United States signed with over 100 trading partners last year. Flouting international law betrays America's historic role as a defender of open trade conducted under fair rules that are honored by countries large and small. The United States complains that the structure of Japan's auto market and regulatory barriers obstructs imports and nullifies Japan's trade commitments. But this valid complaint should be taken to the new World Trade Organization, which was created with American support to help untangle this kind of trade dispute. 
The two countries have already resolved many of their disagreements. Japan agreed to open more dealerships to American manufacturers and to dismantle regulatory burdens, including costly inspections of imported auto parts. But the Japanese Government remains unwilling to pressure manufacturers like Toyota to buy more American parts for their new models.
The United States should not demand that any government, even the Japanese, manage private industry. The basis for the American demand -- that Toyota and other manufacturers turn to local suppliers without giving American companies a fair shot -- is weak. After all, Toyota has a perfect right to tie itself even more rigidly to its suppliers, even through merger, without fear of violating any trade principles. It is hard to imagine the American Government telling General Motors and other American manufacturers they cannot produce many of their own parts.
Japan has vowed to haul the United States before the W.T.O. for imposing unilateral sanctions. Japan will almost surely win the case and authorization to retaliate. It could then impose sanctions against American exports like computers, software or aircraft. At that point, the trade war would threaten the jobs of Americans in ways the initial sanctions on high-priced Japanese autos do not.
The new American tariffs will not go into effect until next month. By then, Japan may accept the American demands. But even if it does, the Clinton strategy would be shortsighted. If the United States ignores its fair trade obligations, other countries will surely follow. Imposing sanctions also risks rupturing relations with a country that shares important security interests with America.
Having started down the wrong road, Mr. Clinton can still turn back by pocketing the agreements on dealerships and parts inspections and declaring victory. He could then refer remaining issues to the W.T.O. That way there would be neither a trade war nor bruised relations with an important ally.

HEADLINE: Lyford Greene, 91; Served With AT&T As Chief Economist

 BODY:
Lyford N. Greene, a former chief economist of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company who helped influence Federal regulation of the telephone system, died on Tuesday at White Plains Hospital. He was 91.
The cause of death was complications from heart disease. 
 Born in Iowa, Mr. Greene was a graduate of Grinnell College and Northwestern University, where he received a master's degree in 1927. He began his career as an economist with Illinois Bell, moving to AT&T in 1929. He later became chief economist, filling that role until his retirement in 1969. Early in his career, Mr. Greene also taught statistics at Columbia University.
Mr. Greene was chief economist at AT&T when the Federal Government was increasing its regulation of public utilities and their pricing policies. He was a strong proponent of the notion that capital-intensive industries, like the telephone system, need to earn a sufficient rate of return on their investments in plant and equipment. In that role he was closely involved in AT&T's responses to the so-called rate cases that the Federal Government brought to regulate telephone rates.
Mr. Greene is survived by his wife, Margaret Emma-Louise Greene of Scarsdale, N.Y., a daughter, Gretchen Greene Yeo, the former head of foreign exchange at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, of New York City and Lowellville, Ohio; a son, Lyford Kluge Greene of Silver Spring, Md.; four grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: U.S. Can't Afford Economic Equality for All;
Flimflam on Medicare

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We certified public accountants may disagree about the Medicare issue, but we do know cooking the books when we see it. Congress's proposed cuts in Medicare is the main element of its high-wire budget-balancing act (front page, May 11). 
 Both the Medicare and Social Security Trust Funds get their money from a 15.3 percent payroll tax. Though the Social Security fund throws off an annual surplus of more than $50 billion, the Republicans say it will take annual cuts in Medicare of about $40 billion to avoid that fund's running a deficit after the year 2002.
But here's your political flimflam: Instead of the Treasury's using the Social Security surplus to pay the Medicare shortfall, it uses that trust fund to pay the other Government bills that create the budget deficit!
Thus the excuse for cutting Medicare and Medicaid budget allowances. Rather than Social Security subsidizing Medicare, they'd use it to continue subsidizing the well-to-do taxpayers and corporations, with tax cuts and subsidies for agribusiness, mining and lumber companies.
If Congress is serious about the deficit, they could wipe it out in about three years by a simple technical device: dropping the unfair tax loophole that stops charging any Social Security tax after a salary reaches $61,200. That costs the Treasury more than $80 billion a year. Yet they don't cut salary off for the Medicare part of the tax.
Now Newt Gingrich proposes a cap on Medicare benefits. Why not cap the old-age benefits on high-salaried professionals and managers instead? Or do they only oppose soaking the rich, but not the poor and elderly?

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Using Our Brains

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Practical people agree that the best way to balance the budget is to reduce by half the relentless increase in the cost of Medicare.
But no politician of either party wants to face up to the need to push the elderly into cost-saving managed care, or to reduce benefits, or to ask rich geezers for substantial co-payments. 
 What sweetener can we come up with to make the budgetary medicine go down? Many seniors on Medicare are frightened; how can we replace their fear with hope?
A couple of Nobel laureates came to Congress this week with a big chunk of the answer. One is the molecular biologist James Watson, co-discoverer of DNA; the other is the physicist Leon Cooper, pioneer of superconductivity.
These heavy hitters left their original disciplines to concentrate on today's most exciting and productive field of medicine: the science of the brain.
"Neurological and psychiatric disorders," says Dr. Watson, "count for more hospitalizations and more prolonged care than almost all diseases combined." One in five Americans is directly affected. The Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives estimates the yearly costs of everything from stroke, depression, tumors and head injuries, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Parkinson's and other afflictions of the brain to exceed a half-trillion dollars a year.
Now here's the good news: According to "Delivering Results: A Progress Report on Brain Research," just released by the alliance, breakthroughs have been stunning in starting to treat and cure these ailments that fill up our hospitals.
Genes have been found that lead to Alzheimer's, and a transgenic mouse has been produced to test drugs to slow the disease's onset; brain scientists expect medication by 1999. A treatment has been identified to alter the course of multiple sclerosis. New findings show how genetic research may treat manic-depressive illness, drug and alcohol addiction and epilepsy. Relief for some sufferers of migraine headaches is already here.
Neuroscientists used to conceal their excitement about potential advances; other diseases, from cancer to AIDS, received more publicity and support. Now the brain scientists have awakened to the need to report to the public and Congress the results they have been delivering; they are willing to predict what other measurable results that private and public investment in more research would bring.
I was roped into helping raise awareness of brain science by David Mahoney, head of the Dana Foundation, who organized the scientists' alliance; Jim Watson calls him "this generation's Mary Lasker," after the philanthropist who energized health care.
As a Dana board member, I was inspired to write this piece by the examples of Mike Wallace, who is willing to talk candidly about his bouts of depression to help others, and Judy Woodruff, rearing a son with spina bifida and speaking out about the need for research on brain diseases.
To the political point that scientists cannot make: One way to slow Medicare's rising cost is to cure or ameliorate diseases that drive people into hospitals. Neuroscience has demonstrable momentum halfway through this "decade of the brain"; by pressing our strength now, we will save trillions in a few years.
With such a payoff in clear sight, common economic sense suggests Americans invest at least a few more billion in brain research. Let's see the state of play:
The Clinton budget for the National Institutes of Health proposed only a 4 percent increase, with not enough of that earmarked for neuroscience. Clinton is at least moving in the right direction; but the early G.O.P. proposals are far more shortsighted, actually cutting the dollars needed to finance tomorrow's cures.
That's a no-brainer, pennywise and pound foolish. The House Republican leader who grasps the potential -- life-saving and money-saving -- of biomedical investment is John Porter of Illinois; if he can sell Newt Gingrich on the need to outstrip the Clinton proposal, brain research is likely to find a sympathetic ear in the Senate's Pete Domenici.
The political message should be clear: Seed money invested in brain research will help contain the cost of Medicare while giving an aging generation new hope.

HEADLINE: No-Name Publisher Who Can Attract Big-Name Authors

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
As Kenzaburo Oe, winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize in Literature, puttered in and out of bookstores and receptions in New York and Boston recently, on tour with his novel "Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids," his main escort was not one of the powerhouse British or American publishers who usually claim Nobel winners.
 Instead, the soft-spoken and graying Mr. Oe (pronounced OH-eh) was accompanied by Marion Boyars, a petite, older woman with thick dark eyebrows, a brunette bob and a British accent, whose publishing ventures have been as unconventional as she is. Nonetheless, Marion Boyars Publishing puts out about 25 books a year, including works by Mr. Oe and three other Nobel laureates. 
In the case of Mr. Oe, in the 1960's and 70's several publishers, including Grove Press, M. E. Sharpe and Kodansha, published his works in English, but the books sold only moderately.
 So early last year, Ms. Boyars was not surprised to find herself the lone suitor for the English-language rights to "Nip the Buds," the story of Japanese reformatory boys at the end of a war, and "Hiroshima Notes," Mr. Oe's statement on the Hiroshima bomb.
 Ten months later, Mr. Oe won the Nobel, all but guaranteeing future commercial success. Grove quickly scrambled for paperback rights to the two books as well as five other previously untranslated Oe titles.
 "No one was buying Oe at the time, because he wasn't going to be a best seller," Ms. Boyars said during an interview in her East Side hotel in Manhattan, smiling politely and taking a long drag on a cigarette as she made the obvious swipe at publishers who lean toward blockbusters. "It was sheer chance, just sheer chance. We weren't thinking in terms of Nobel. We bought it because we liked it. Most of my publishing is out of enthusiasm."
 It clearly isn't out of fiscal prudence.
 Her first Oe book, for example, "Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness" (1978), sold a mere 500 copies, failing to earn back its modest advance. Still, she eagerly bought two more.
 In fact, for most of her publishing career, she says, she has operated on a shoestring with a handful of employees who "do everything." An average print run for Marion Boyars Publishing is 3,000 copies. (John Grisham's first print run for "The Rainmaker" was 2.8 million.) And competing for British or American authors is usually unrealistic. "The moment I try to compete, the bigger publishers always have more money," she moans.
 Some American publishers say they have never heard of Ms. Boyars. Those who have tend to describe her as an odd duck who publishes bits and pieces of authors' oeuvres. It's partly true. She has, for example, only one of Eudora Welty's books, "The Collected Stories of Eudora Welty" and one work by Elias Canetti, "Kafka's Other Trial."
 But unlike many American publishers, who bridle at pursuing foreign authors in translation, Ms. Boyars, who speaks French and German, says that the overlooked books and translations are often her gems.
 Morgan Entrekin, president and publisher of Grove/Atlantic, the parent of Grove Press, said: "Marion is the last of a dying breed of eccentric, entrepreneurial, idiosyncratic publishers who publishes her passions. I have a lot of respect for her that she has hung in there for so long. It is very hard for a publishing program built entirely of this kind of work to survive."
 Though she now publishes in both the United States and Britain, her books are increasingly the types published not by big trade houses but by university presses and a handful of literary publishers, like Farrar, Straus & Giroux or and Knopf.
 "I am a multinational dwarf," she laughs. (She is in fact just over 5 feet tall.)
 A native of New York City, Ms. Boyars moved to England with her first husband and earned a bachelor's degree in politics, philosophy and economics from Keele University in Staffordshire, England. In 1960, with no previous experience in publishing, Ms. Boyars, then 31, newly divorced and the mother of two, bought 50 percent of John Calder Publishers and became the first woman in the Britain to be a publisher on her own, that is, not through inheritance or marriage.
 As Calder & Boyars, she and John Calder developed a reputation as one of London's more daring fiction publishers. Together, they published Heinrich Boll, Eugenio Montale, William S. Burroughs and Samuel Beckett as well as many modern French novelists. They also specialized in the writings of modern composers, including John Cage, Igor Stravinsky and Charles Ives, and of social commentators, including Ivan Illich, Robert Heilbroner and Thomas Szasz.
 "They were experimental publishers," said Roger Strauss. "They were into avant-garde literature at a time when other people weren't interested or willing to take a chance."
 In 1966, they were slapped with an obscenity suit based on their publication of Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel, "Last Exit to Brooklyn," in Britain. They ultimately won in what became a landmark publishing case there.
 "We were very daring," she says. (They also published Henry Miller's "Tropic of Cancer," "Tropic of Capricorn" and "Black Spring" in Britain, but were spared legal squabbles.)
 In 1975, her partnership with Mr. Calder crumbling, she formed Marion Boyars Publishers as a separate imprint. And the next year, she and Mr. Calder divided the list and began publishing independently. Among others, Ms. Boyars got their big money maker, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," by Ken Kesey, and the composers, among others.
 Since then, with a staff of five people, Ms. Boyars has continued on, a small independent publisher struggling to keep afloat financially. But through a combination of strategy and luck, she has acquired an intriguing list of some 500 titles and such writers as Michael Ondaatje, Georges Bataille and Tim O'Brien. She also publishes the correspondence of Gabriel Faure and Edvard Grieg, the autobiography of Darius Milhaud, and "The Dancer and the Dance" by Merce Cunningham.
 As for Mr. Oe, at one of his signings in New York he said he liked publishing with Ms. Boyars because of her wide literary knowledge. "I can talk with her about literature so easily," he said.
 Keeping up, however, seems to be wearing on Ms. Boyars. When asked about the future, she says she might be interested in selling her company if the right buyer came along. "I'm getting older," she added. "Perhaps I would like someone to take me over."

HEADLINE: HOUSE PROUD;
The Dream On the Hill

BYLINE: By HARRIET EDLESON 

 BODY:
IT was the opening sentence of her letter that captured his interest: I just bought a lot on a cliff 350 feet above the Cacapon River in West Virginia, and I'm interested in building a house.
"It could have stopped right there and I'd still have accepted," Mark McInturff, the architect, said. "You just imagine Frank Lloyd Wright getting a letter like that about Falling Water." 
 The letter writer, Jane Couch, had something a lot simpler in mind for her weekend retreat: three barnlike structures that she had dreamed about for years. Once she even built her own scale model. Her cat chewed one corner off before Ms. Couch, a computer programmer in Washington, gave up on finding the right site.
Then in 1991, driving near Paw Paw, W.Va., about three hours from home, she came upon the cliff and ravine she had pictured in her mind many years before, five and a half acres of mostly wooded hillside. "Just enough flat space for a house," she remembers thinking.
Ms. Couch bought the land for $33,000 and began to create the dream house with a budget of $127,000.
She had admired the rural simplicity of a friend's home designed by Mr. McInturff of Bethesda, Md. Could he create agricultural shapes with black roofs that looked like they fit the land, not like some import from another place or time? And could she have a two-story main house (living room, kitchen and sleeping loft), a one-story work studio with windows on three sides and, the avid bird watcher requested, a three-story tower of porches?
No dining room needed. She planned to eat at a little counter overlooking the river.
"I brought my orange cardboard model," Ms. Couch said, breaking into a smile. "It's a wonder he didn't throw me out or laugh in my face."
In fact, Mr. McInturff was intrigued. He'd never had a client who was as clear as Ms. Couch about what she wanted.
The project, almost three years from conception to completion, was, by design, developed and executed in stages by the owner, the architect and the builders, Bruce Behrens and Mark Smith. "We all helped it along," Ms. Couch said. "Then it sort of took on a life of its own." To economize and to allow herself time to become comfortable with the house, Mr. McInturff said, "she would hire us for a few days, go away and think about it for a long time, and then she'd come back and say, 'O.K., I like this.' "
The house on Hemlock Hill, as Ms. Couch calls her retreat, is a unique contemporary structure that opens onto a panoramic view of the Cacapon River below. Perched atop a mountain dotted with hemlock trees, some of which are 350 years old, the house combines a rustic exterior with a minimalist interior.
"It's almost like a lunar landing site," Mr. McInturff said, adding that the house "just comes down and touches the ground very delicately." Since he designed the house to fit the land, he situated the pieces at the level he wanted it, then, as he described it, "dropped the legs down." At the cliff side of the main building, the legs are 4 to 5 feet above the ground; at the studio, the legs are 8 to 10 feet tall.
An 88-foot stone wall visually and structurally anchors the house to the crest of the hill and connects the three buildings. Beginning outside the studio, it zigzags through the living room of the main house and continues along the outside of the tower building, which comprises a storage space at ground level, a second-story screened porch and a third-story open but roofed platform.
The road side of the 1,000-square-foot compound has just four small windows and presents an enigmatic facade, playing with scale and expectation. Shallow stairs peek out between the main house and the studio.
Inside the main house, the drama begins. Windows dominate three sides of the 16-by-32-foot living area, framing various views of the river and the surrounding mountains. Except for a small cabin in the distance, no sign of human life can be seen.
A stone, tile and hand-hewn-beam fireplace and the interior section of the stone wall are the focal points of the step-down living space. A contiguous kitchen with an eating counter, which affords an upstream river view, completes the first floor. There is no dining table for lingering -- Ms. Couch designed her home with privacy in mind.
A staircase leads to the second-floor 12-by-12-foot sleeping loft, where Ms. Couch can view the first two houses built on Hemlock Hill -- birdhouses. Her two Russian blue cats -- Gabriel, 15, and Daphne, 13 1/2 -- use the loft as their retreat. From here, a bridge leads to the 12-by-12-foot second-story screened porch and outdoor stairs, which climb to the tower lookout.
Since moving in on New Year's Eve, Ms. Couch has been awed. "I still find it hard to believe that I have this wonderful house," she said. Recalling her first morning in the house, she said: "I woke up and there were icicles on the trees. It was like a fairyland."
Yet, she said, "the way I live didn't change -- it's just a whole lot better." She still bird-watches, but from a more spectacular vantage point; reads, and intends to spend more time drawing and painting in the studio as she gets more settled. Meanwhile, she revels in her land, walking the paths she cut into the hillside with the help of a friend on weekends.
There were times during construction when Ms. Couch felt overwhelmed by the enormity of what she had undertaken. "I wondered, 'Will this ever end?' " she said.
She coped by looking at it one step at a time. "If you look at the whole thing at once," she said, "you're liable to throw up your hands and just say, 'I can't handle it.' "
Now, she speaks of her determination to see it through and the peace of mind the house has brought her. Have the courage to live out -- and in -- your fantasy, she urges others.
"If you want something badly enough," she said, "if you have it in your mind all the time, chances are it's going to happen."
 
Specs
 THE house on Hemlock Hill was a labor of love for both its owner, Jane Couch, and its architect, Mark McInturff of McInturff Architects in Bethesda, Md. Ms. Couch didn't want to spend a lot of money, and McInturff didn't expect to earn a lot. Rather than charging a percentage of the construction cost, which is the way he often works, Mr. McInturff agreed to work by the hour. "She was buying us in bits and pieces," he said.
The contract price was $127,000. Ms. Couch also paid for exterior drawings and models of the house. She chose Bruce Behrens and Mark Smith of the Mountaineer Construction Corporation in Romney, W.Va., to build the wood frame house with plywood subsiding and board-and-batten exterior poplar siding. The builder fee was to be 10 percent of the contract price.
"It's important to find a good and sympathetic builder," Mr. McInturff said, adding that anyone considering building at a great distance from the architect might consider "a simple, rational structure," which is easier to communicate to a local builder.
To that end, Mr. McInturff kept the detailing consistent wherever possible: all three roofs have the same eaves details and pitches, for example. The $127,000 contract price, which ran over by only $700, included $3,500 to pour the concrete footings, which, along with metal tie-downs, anchor the structures into the stone foundation.
"The porches and tower are subject to pretty significant winds," Mr. McInturff said. "You're not worried about the building falling but about it being lifted like an umbrella when the wind comes up under the roof."

HEADLINE: Man Killed After Stealing Tank for Rampage

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, May 17

 BODY:
A man stole a 63-ton military tank from a National Guard armory here and used it to rampage through neighborhoods, flattening utility poles, fire hydrants and cars before getting stuck on a road divider. Police officers fatally shot the man as he tried to get the tank moving.
No bystanders were injured in the event on Wednesday evening. The tank's weapons -- a 105-millimeter cannon, a 12.7-millimeter antiaircraft gun and a 7.62-millimeter machine gun -- were not loaded, said Maj. Ed Gale of the California National Guard. 
 The driver was identified as Shawn Nelson, an unemployed plumber who had served in the military; he was believed to be in his mid-30's. The police said they had shot Mr. Nelson because they feared that if he got the tank moving again traffic would be endangered.
"The guy was just going crazy," said Kelly Bird, who said he saw at least 25 cars flattened. "He was mowing cars over."
Capt. Tom Hall of the police said: "He shifted into the proper gear and was preparing to spin the tank so he could get off the high-riser. He knew what he was doing."
The authorities were unsure how Mr. Nelson had managed to steal the M-60 tank from the armory.
Neighbors said Mr. Nelson's life had been crumbling. His home here was apparently in foreclosure and his utilities had been shut off. He also had a history of medical problems, including a broken back from a motorcycle accident.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Once More, With Feeling

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
"Make no mistake about it, this bill is a historic watershed," said Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon. "If this bill does not work, or if Congress and the President attempt to frustrate it, we will lose our last significant opportunity to deal with the deficit."
Those sentiments were expressed repeatedly today as the House of Representatives approved a resolution that is supposed to lead to a balanced budget by 2002 and the Senate began debate on a companion measure. 
 But Senator Packwood's remarks were not made today. They came on the night 10 years ago when Congress approved the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, which was meant to put the budget into balance by 1991.
The fact is, Congress has been promising a balanced budget ever since 1978, when legislation was adopted stating that beginning in the fiscal year 1981, spending "shall not exceed" receipts.
But each time the screw was tightened so much that people were threatened with actual pain from reductions in Government programs, Congress passed new legislation that relaxed the pressure. And the Federal budget deficit -- the amount by which Government spending exceeds revenues each year -- continued to rise.
The question now is whether this year is different -- whether this time Congress will actually follow through on its resolve to adopt and stick to policies leading to a balanced budget, or whether today's promises will evaporate once the heat is turned up, like so many drops of water in a skillet.
No one can answer the question with any confidence. But economists and political analysts agree that this year feels different.
One reason is that the Republicans who control Congress are unified like no other party in decades, and they are committed to the goal of a balanced budget. Many of those elected for the first time last year believe that their advocacy of a balanced budget was crucial to their success at the polls.
Another difference is that the budget resolutions in the House and Senate this year, for all their lack of specifics, contain few of the gimmicks and unrealistic economic assumptions that characterized many of the previous measures that promised a balanced budget. Republicans have even promised to take risky political steps, like slowing the growth of Medicare so much that retirees will have to pay more for their medical insurance or face reduced services.
Even so, for those who believe that the country's economic future rests on a balanced budget, neither the history nor the politics of the issue is encouraging. It is important to remember that whatever gets enacted this year can always be changed by the next Congress or the ones that follow.
The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation in 1985 set specific deficit levels for each of the next five years and required automatic cuts in Government programs across the board -- a process known as sequestration -- if the levels were exceeded.
Partly because the economy was never as strong as policy makers predicted, partly because the savings and loan bailout was so expensive and partly because politicians lacked the necessary commitment, the proscribed deficit limit was never met in any year. No meaningful sequestration ever occurred.
In 1987, facing the seemingly impossible task of lowering the deficit to $108 billion in the fiscal year 1988, Congress changed the law. New annual deficit ceilings were set, and the date for budget balance was put off till 1993. The deficit in the fiscal year 1988, incidentally, turned out to be $155 billion.
In 1990, with the economy in recession and the projected deficit so far above what the law required that sequestration would have proved crippling, Congress abandoned Gramm-Rudman-Hollings and adopted a new scheme of tax increases and budget reductions. The deficit in the fiscal year 1991, supposed to be $64 billion under the old law, was $269 billion.
The measures agreed to by President George Bush and Congress in 1990 and similar ones approved by President Clinton and Congress in 1993 kept the annual deficits substantially lower than they would have been otherwise. But these measures were intended to balance the budget. And largely because of the growth in health costs, the deficits will soar by the end of the decade without further belt-tightening.
As a political matter, Robert D. Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, provides this maxim: "No good deed goes unpunished when it comes to deficit reduction."
Republicans in the Senate, who were primarily responsible for enacting the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law in 1985, lost control of the Senate in the elections the following year. Mr. Bush, who broke his no-new-taxes pledge in the name of deficit reduction in 1990, lost his bid for re-election. And, of course, the Democrats who backed President Clinton's budget plan in 1993 lost control of the House and Senate last year.
Opinion polls show that while the public believes strongly in a balanced budget in the abstract, support plummets when people are asked whether they would be willing to accept specific sacrifices like a tax increase or less spending for Medicare to achieve the goal.
The first test of the Republican resolve will come later this year when lawmakers have to specify how they would achieve the savings they need in popular programs like Medicare.
Carol Cox Wait, president of the private Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a zealous advocate of a balanced budget, said she thought there was a slightly better than even chance that the necessary policies would be enacted this year. If they are put into law, she said, they might stick this time because Congress would be reluctant to vote to "unbalance the budget."
Mr. Reischauer, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, predicted that even if Congress set forth this year on a dedicated journey toward a balanced budget, substantial mid-course corrections would made in a few years when the pressure became unbearable. But that would not mean, he said, that the goal of a balanced budget would not eventually be reached.
Rudolph G. Penner, who was director of the Congressional Budget Office in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings years, had this response when he was asked whether he thought this year was different:
"In every previous year, I would have been totally cynical. This year, I'm not cynical. I just don't know."

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
HOUSE ENDORSES BALANCED BUDGET IN 238-to-193 VOTE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
With barely a glance at an embittered Democratic minority, Republicans in the House of Representatives took a daunting political step today and endorsed a broad blueprint, complete with dollars-and-cents targets, for balancing the Federal budget.
The vote for the plan was 238 to 193, with 8 conservative Democrats joining the Republican majority. A lone Republican, Representative Michael P. Flanagan of Chicago, voted no, saying the budget unduly punished urban areas. Four lawmakers did not vote. 
 Republicans easily rejected three alternatives to their proposal, two of them from factions of conservative and liberal Democrats, before the final vote.
The Republican plan is a seven-year behemoth plotting a course that would reduce by $1.5 trillion the spending now envisioned in Federal budgets through the year 2002. Most of that is aimed at erasing an annual deficit that threatens to race past $200 billion next year and stay there. Roughly $350 billion of the package, however, is earmarked to pay for personal and business tax breaks that the House approved last month.
The Senate began debate today on its version of the balanced-budget plan -- one that rejects any immediate tax cut -- with a final vote likely next week. The two houses must forge a single compromise plan out of their two proposals next month, with the difference over taxes the central issue.
That document would then become the framework for an actual 1996 Federal budget whose details will be filled in by House and Senate committees this summer and fall.
Difficult issues still remain. Chief among them is devising a specific plan for how to save $280 billion in spending for Medicare, the popular but costly Government health program for the elderly. But in the end, the Republicans must also present a final budget with enough Democratic support to mollify President Clinton, who is solidly opposed to some major components of the plan and may well veto parts of it.
The tax reductions, which the House's Democrats called a gift to the nation's monied class, were the bone of the two-day debate that amounted, at most times, to a struggle for the hearts and minds of the nation's broad middle class.
Democrats cast the Republicans almost as Dickensian characters, greedy Scrooges hoarding their shillings while the poor suffered, and called their budget plan "an attack on working-class Americans."
To dramatize the point for television viewers, they held up scores of photographs of voters who they said would be devastated by the daunting changes -- in Medicare, Medicaid, education assistance, for example -- implicit in the Republican proposal.
"You're not voting for charts and graphs and numbers, but you're voting for flesh-and-blood people who depend on you," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, scolding the Republicans. Mr. Gephardt said the plan would cost retired people $1,300 in increased Medicare fees and reduced Social Security benefits by the time the budget is balanced in 2002.
"It would be one thing if what we were asking them to do is to balance the budget," he said, referring to the elderly. "But we're taking $1,300 from these folks so we can give a $20,000-a-year tax break to people earning $350,000 a year or more."
Mr. Gephardt was citing a Treasury Department study that estimated that the top 1 percent of wage earners would receive a tax reduction averaging $20,352 a year if the House tax plan became law.
Republicans, noting that Mr. Gephardt and other Democratic leaders had no budget-balancing plan of their own to offer, mocked their critics as "bereft of ideas" and accused them of fighting the proposal with scare tactics.
"The party that once said, 'There is nothing to fear but fear itself,' now has nothing to offer but fear itself," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader.
Republicans cast their proposal as a plan to shift money and power from Washington to the nation's hometowns, as a fiscal tonic that would lower inflation and increase employment, and even as a matter of principle.
Mr. Armey said the debate was not about numbers but about morality, "whether this generation will keep cheating on the next" by spending tax dollars yet to be paid.
The principal author of the plan, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, held before Democrats a picture of his own, showing a row of babies. "I want to show you who we're doing this for," he told them.
Mr. Kasich, a 43-year-old Republican who heads the House Budget Committee, paid tribute to the Democrats' 40 years of House rule, saying they had wielded Government power for immense good and that approval of a Republican budget plan "doesn't mean the Government doesn't have a role -- it does."
But "the 21st century is about the power of the individual," he said. "It's not about the power of bureaucracy and red tape. Because bureaucracy and red tape and, frankly, misplaced compassion do not reward individual achievement."
At 79 pages, dense with number-clogged paragraphs and subparagraphs, the Republican budget proposal looks like anything but the political screed it is. But it commits Republicans for the first time to put their small-Government philosophy into effect by making the cuts and changes in Government services required to meet the measure's new limits on spending.
Past Congresses have balked at such changes, fearing a voter backlash. With today's vote, Republicans in the House effectively promised to make changes or face the political ignominy of failure.
"We've got a long way to go," Mr. Kasich said after the vote. "It's going to take a few years to make this imprint permanent."
Democrats never seriously threatened the Republican juggernaut. But they did offer a conservative alternative to Mr. Kasich's plan that gained enough support to suggest that a bipartisan alliance on a balanced budget may be possible this summer, if not likely.
That alternative, backed by a coalition of conservative Democrats, also was intended to erase the deficit in the next seven years. But rather than cutting taxes, the proposal would have scaled back the Republican cuts in spending on Medicare, Medicaid, student loans, agriculture and a number of other politically popular programs.
The plan gained 100 votes, 90 of them from Democrats. It was rejected by 325 House members, including the Democratic leader, Mr. Gephardt. Later, one of its sponsors, Representative Charles W. Stenholm of Texas, said his party was mistaken to remain silent in the face of a Republican budget initiative.
"The President was perfectly correct in saying to the Republicans, 'Let's see your budget,' " Mr. Stenholm said. "Now they've done that. John Kasich has done a very credible job of doing that. Now let the battle begin."
The Republican leadership also rejected two other alternatives to its plan. One, sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus, would have sharply reduced spending cuts in many social programs and raised taxes to pay for deficit reduction, but was rejected by a vote of 56 to 367.
The second alternative was offered by Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, a New York Republican who heads the House Rules Committee. It sought to balance the budget in five years, without a tax cut, by cutting future spending across the board. That plan was defeated by a vote of 89 to 342.
Congressman Flanagan, the only Republican who voted against the plan that was approved, represents the Chicago working-class district that Representative Dan Rostenkowski held until last fall. Mr. Flanagan later said in a statement that he believed his district and other urban areas would take "an unusually hard hit" should the plan be carried out.
The House later took a second vote on spending cuts and it, too, was largely along party lines. By 235 to 189, the House approved the final version of legislation that would excise $16.5 billion in spending from the current year's budget and allot money for disaster relief in California and Oklahoma City.
The President has vowed to veto that bill, contending that it also is a vehicle for pork-barrel highway projects for Republican lawmakers.

HEADLINE: Dow Plunges 81.96 Points In Largest Selloff of Year

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In the biggest selloff of the year, stock traders knocked down prices from record highs, with the Dow Jones industrial average plummeting 81.96 points, to 4,340.64.
The plunge was so steep that at 3:34 P.M., when the Dow was off more than 50 points, it set off the New York Stock Exchange's "circuit breaker" rules, intended to slow high-speed computer-guided trading and calm a volatile market. But the Dow continued to fall another 30 points. 
 Before yesterday the Dow had risen more than 15 percent -- or 584 points -- this year, and some market-leading stocks like Microsoft had risen more than 40 percent.
"A drop like today changes your complacent attitude toward the market," said Thomas Gallagher, head of equity trading for Oppenheimer & Company. "It's a very spooky market when the Dow gets this high."
A few traders cited familiar reasons for the big move, pointing to a report on the rising trade deficit with Japan and fears that a decline in borrowing costs was coming to an end. Indeed, bond prices fell and long-term interest rates rose somewhat.
But there were also indications that after the nearly seven-month surge of the market, with the Dow hitting six new highs in a row recently, many traders were simply poised to jump out of stocks and take their profits at the first sign of a pullback.
Adding a large measure of selling pressure is the expiration today of two kinds of stock options, an event known as "double witching," which often leads to a large run-up in trading volume and wide swings in price.
Technical analysts also say that it is normal for stock prices to rise sharply for a period and then fall as much as one-third to one-half of the advance. Only when prices fall further do market analysts start talking seriously about a bear market.
"You have to keep this in statistical perspective," said David Holt, vice president of research and strategy for Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. "You have to take today's drop of 82 points and compare it to the almost 750-point rise from Nov. 23, when this latest rally started."
Because stock prices have risen so far and so fast, the moves by the component stocks of the Dow tend to be magnified, both up and down. In 1993, for example, a one-point change in a Dow component stock would make the Dow change about two points. Now, a one-point change would move the Dow about 2.8 points.
Still, the decline yesterday was the biggest fall in blue-chip stock prices since the Dow dropped nearly 47 points on Jan. 19, and almost equaled the fall of more than 91 points last Nov. 22.
The 82-point drop of the Dow was a decline of 1.85 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 dropped 7.49 points, or 1.42 percent, to 519.58, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 7.87 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 864.06.
The Dow is now below 4,400, the level crossed by the market only seven sessions ago, on May 10. It had broken through 4,300 only 19 sessions ago, on April 24.
Despite the fall, there were some signs of strength in the market, said Alan B. Bond, president of Bond, Procope Capital Management. High-technology stocks like Microsoft, Oracle Systems and Cisco Systems all traded higher than or near their opening prices until the last half-hour, indicating options-related trading. At the close of Nasdaq trading, Microsoft was down 1 3/8, to 84 5/8; Oracle was down 1 1/8, to 33 3/8, and Cisco was down 1 3/8, to 44.
High-technology stocks have often been the top performers in recent sessions. Even after the decline yesterday, the American Stock Exchange computer technology index was still up more than 30 percent this year.
"What we saw today was that the tech stocks' leadership is not faltering," Mr. Bond said.
Moreover, because economic conditions are favorable, with interest rates stable and inflation low, stock prices might rebound as early as this morning, said Edward Laux, senior managing director for equity trading at the Chicago Corporation. "The drop in the Dow might scare some weak players," he said. "But given the overall market outlook, we're more likely to have a technical snapback."
The market headed down after the Commerce Department reported that the overall trade deficit narrowed in March, while the deficit with Japan widened.
The narrowing of the overall deficit might have contributed to the fall in prices because it suggested that the economy was not slowing as much as had been anticipated. That would also suggest that inflation was still a threat, casting doubt that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates in the second half of the year, as a growing number of market analysts have told their clients.
The volume on the New York Stock Exchange was higher than normal, at 351.9 million shares, about 5 percent higher than the daily average of 335 million shares this year.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.72 points, to 279.80, with advancing stocks lagging behind declining stocks by 552 to 1,780. The American Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.07 points, to 487.45.
Among the advancing stocks was Opal Inc., a maker of equipment used in manufacturing computer chips, which rose 6 1/4, to 19 1/4, in its first day of trading.
Among the declining stocks was Forest Laboratories, a medical supplies company, which fell 5 3/8, to 41 1/4, after the Food and Drug Administration refused to accept its application on a respiratory drug for premature babies. Xerox fell 4 3/8, to 117 3/4, after its board voted to keep its dividend unchanged.
The most active stock, with 10.7 million shares traded, was Intel, which closed unchanged at 110 3/4.

HEADLINE: Faster Exit Off Welfare?;
Connecticut Plan Stresses Job Placement Over Classes

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 18

 BODY:
At first glance, Takela Roberts would appear to be an example of what Gov. John G. Rowland wants from welfare recipients: a woman who desperately wants to get off the dole and is working hard to do it.
But after completing her first year of community college classes with a B-plus average, Ms. Roberts, 23, learned last Friday that the state may no longer financially support her effort to become a registered nurse and that the training program she has benefited from is being dramatically changed as the Governor revamps the state's welfare system. 
 "I'm devastated," she said, upon hearing that the program that provides aid for child care, transportation to school and tuition was being dramatically changed. "That money is my backbone."
Ms. Roberts, who said she may have to drop out of college, is one of hundreds of single mothers here caught in the fallout from the national welfare debate. Gov. Rowland has embarked on an ambitious program to move 40,000 families off the welfare rolls and into employment as rapidly as possible over the next four years.
To achieve that goal, he needs to place a large number of people fast. And so, the Republican Governor has decided to abandon the state's long-range education and job training program, which now typically takes two or more years to complete, and replace it with a brief job placement service that will reach more welfare recipients, but teach them more modest skills like how to write resumes, look for work and be responsible employees.
This will change the current program -- which graduated 2,030 people into the work force last year -- into an employment service that as of July 1, will begin immediately placing people in jobs. The goal is for the new program to find work for 9,000 people a year, more than four times the number currently finding jobs.
Many of those in favor of the change are not saying the current training and placement program does not work, but rather that it costs too much for the number being served. "The old way is too expensive," said David L. Boomer, a Republican Senate aide and a longtime Rowland adviser. "It's great to offer it, but when you have to serve 40,000 people, you can't give Cadillac services."
There is, however, one major question.
"Where are they going to get the jobs?" asked Janet L. Van Tassel, executive director of the Legal Assistance Resource Center of Connecticut and a critic of the Rowland approach. As of March, there were at least 92,600 unemployed people in the state, and the State Labor Department has projected only 51,431 openings between 1992 and 2000. Mr. Rowland would add thousands of welfare recipients to this mix.
The new direction in the state program, known as Job Connection, is part of a widespread debate taking place in Washington and state capitals about the best way to move people off welfare. It generally pits Republicans who want to take punitive steps to force people off the rolls against Democrats who say that such efforts are shortsighted.
Like many Republicans, Mr. Rowland says that the welfare system breeds dependency. Economic incentives -- lower benefits and tax credits to employers to hire welfare recipients -- will break this dependency and force recipients into the job market, he says.
Still, Mr. Rowland takes this argument one step further than many other Republican governors. States like Iowa that have tried to get people off welfare quickly have found that it has required increased spending for job training, child care and transportation in its early years. But Mr. Rowland maintains that he will achieve savings immediately and remove hundreds from the rolls in the first few months.
The restyled Job Connection program would be there to ease the transition, Mr. Rowland's supporters say.
Opponents contend that the Governor's approach ignores the realities of the economy, making women compete for a limited number of unskilled jobs that will not ultimately offer a long-term solution to their problems.
"The Governor's approach is too simplistic," State Representative Jack Thompson, a Democrat, said. "Just bringing economic pressure on these people is not going to bring about change. There's got to be a training component and there's got to be additional education."
Under Mr. Rowland's plan, beginning in 1996, all recipients of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children welfare program who are judged employable will have 21 months to find work before their benefits are cut off. If the plan is enacted, state officials estimate that the benefits of about 40,000 families will be affected by this deadline, expected to be the strictest in the nation.
To encourage the transition from welfare to work, Mr. Rowland has proposed cutting benefits for a family of three to as low as $514, the 1988 level, from $581, making a minimum wage job more financially appealing.
Employers who hire welfare recipients would be eligible for corporate tax credits of $1,500 for each recipient they hire. Medicaid and child-care assistance would be continued for two years after a person left the welfare rolls for work, so that health coverage and child-care would no longer be reasons for quitting a job.
In addition to their benefits, welfare recipients would be allowed to keep wages up to the Federal poverty level of $12,000 for a family of three for the 21 months. The state now deducts part of their benefits for two of every three dollars of nonwelfare income.
While the Governor's plan has won substantial support among lawmakers, it still must be passed by the State Legislature and then approved by the Federal Government.
But the State Department of Social Services has sent out notices to the nonprofit contractors that are financed through the Job Connection program saying that it was allowing their contracts to expire on June 30. In an April 25 letter to Governor Rowland, Joyce Thomas, the Social Services Commissioner, said, "There is a need for D.S.S. to begin the phaseout of contracts that will not result in a job immediately."
Earlier this month, the department issued an outline for the new Job Connection program, a step that begins the process of awarding new contracts for services that "lead directly to, and support, employment."
Although the state has made provisions for some of the 1,658 women currently enrolled in community colleges to continue their education, lawmakers from both parties, advocates for the poor and recipients said that the vast majority are in jeopardy of having to leave school. And with the new 21-month limit, community college will not be an option, as it takes at least two years to earn a degree.
The outline also says that all able-bodied recipients are expected to work, the exception being "teen parents satisfactorily progressing toward completing their high school education or its equivalent."
The department has established a goal of placing 3,000 welfare recipients in jobs in the first four months of the program, from July 1 to October 31, and ultimately of achieving an annual placement of 9,000 people a year.
This would represent a dramatic shift in the number of people passing through the program. Since the Job Connection program was established in 1985, it has successfully prepared between 2,000 to 4,000 people a year for employment, helping participants through community colleges, vocational training schools, on-the-job training programs and high school equivalency classes.
There were 13,682 of the state's 58,000 recipients of Aid to Families With Dependent Children in the program last year, with a waiting list of at least 10,000 people. Many have not been able to use its services because of a lack of funding for child-care services, officials said.
About $8.5 million in Job Connection money was distributed to more than 36 agencies this year. Mr. Boomer, an architect of the new plan, said that the state would use the same amount of money to accomplish much more.
Claudette Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the Social Services Department, said that the new program would no longer require labor-intensive case management and the in-depth assessment of a recipients' skills, work history and career interests, making it less costly.
It is hard to gauge how well the new plan will do, since arguments about the effectiveness of training welfare recipients are grounded as much in philosophy as in hard fact.
For instance, Mr. Boomer cited a three-year study of a California program similar to Job Connection. It showed that 53 percent were moved off welfare through job training. In a control group whose members had no extra training, 50 percent still left the welfare rolls. The study also showed that for every dollar California spent on the program, it only received 76 cents back in savings.
Yet Mr. Boomer acknowledged that supporters of California's long-term training program could also draw favorable conclusions from the same study. The study revealed that those in the program had higher earnings. It also predicted that there would be greater savings for the state over the long run.
Among welfare recipients, there appears little doubt that Mr. Rowland's plan is, at best, misguided.
Last week in Hartford, single mothers in a Job Connection program at Capital Community-Technical College grew upset when they learned that it would stop on June 30 and they would have to find work.
"I will do anything to feed my kids," one woman told the group. "I will sell myself, I will sell drugs. But there are no jobs in Hartford."
At a meeting of welfare recipients last Friday in New Haven, mothers who had been in and out of Aid to Families With Dependent Childrenfor the last decade agreed with Mr. Rowland's desire to improve the system, but said the plan appeared to be more interested in saving money than helping them.
And they spoke bitterly about how much of Mr. Rowland's talk has been about welfare fraud and people being too lazy to look for work.
"Most of us aren't criminals or out to defraud the system," said Fern Coleman, 32, of West Haven, a welfare recipient who has alternated between menial jobs and welfare for the last 13 years. "I have no problem working, but the skills I have are not enough."
"People talk like being on assistance is just sitting back and waiting for your check," she said. "We all want a better life, but a job at McDonald's isn't going to take care of my three kids."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
The wallboard giant USG may be ready for another climb.

BYLINE: By Barnaby Feder 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
WHEN the National Gypsum Company, the country's second-largest maker of gypsum-coated wallboard, agreed on Tuesday to a $1.2 billion takeover bid by an investment company led by its former chairman, interest turned as well to its rival, the USG Corporation. That same day, shares of USG, the industry leader with 35 percent of the market, jumped $1.50 in heavy trading and reached a 52-week high of $26.75.
USG's stock slipped back to $26 a share by the close of trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, but it is still up more than 50 percent from last fall's low of $17.25. 
 Despite that rapid ascent, analysts say USG has plenty of upside left. The company, which is based here, does not have the easiest balance sheet to understand, but some analysts say it is not difficult to conclude that the stock could climb another 50 percent or more before running out of steam.
"When construction stocks move, they move in leaps and bounds," said Barbara Allen, who follows the wallboard industry for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Ms. Allen sees USG trading from $40 to $50 a share within 12 months.
Ivy Schneider, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said, "It has at least another 20 percent upside potential before I'd start taking profits."
Behind the optimism is a widely shared view among analysts that investors unduly punished USG, along with other stocks sensitive to interest-rate swings, when they worried early last year that rate increases by the Federal Reserve would kill the housing market. The stock had reached $36 in March 1994, when the sectorwide rout began.
"Now the market has begun re-evaluating specific companies and the psychology has shifted so that being interest-rate sensitive isn't a curse," said Jonathan Goldfarb, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company who includes USG among a handful of building-related stocks with his strongest buy rating.
Some of the lift in USG's stock is coming from industry conditions: housing is stronger than pessimists projected when the rate increases started; the wallboard industry is operating at capacity everywhere except California, and wallboard prices have rocketed from a low of $68 for 1,000 square feet in early 1992 to about $112 now, with another increase expected this summer.
But analysts note that USG is also benefiting from growth in its acoustic-ceiling business, its strong position in remodeling markets and its overseas sales. USG has also invested in keeping its manufacturing plants up to date even while paring debt from $3.1 billion in early 1993 to slightly more than $1 billion today.
The biggest cloud is that USG's own material costs are rising rapidly, especially for the recycled paper that is made into backing for its sheetrock wallboard. And the company is still a defendant in tens of thousands of asbestos-related personal injury and property damage lawsuits. The number of outstanding suits declined last year for the first time since they began to appear in force in the 1980's, but to really be safe, USG will have to beat back efforts by its insurers to overturn court decisions that have ordered them to foot most of USG's liability.
It does not help that the company's balance sheet is still scarred by the financial mayhem of the 1980's, when it became the target of takeover attempts by the Belzberg family of Canada and then Desert Partners, an investment group organized by Texas oilmen. The debt it assumed to fend off the raids led to a prepackaged bankruptcy in 1993, from which it quickly emerged.
Accounting charges and the need to pay down debt from the reorganization keep USG's bottom line in the red. But the more revealing figure -- cash flow from operations -- has been surprisingly robust.
"They've beaten the tar out of our earnings estimates for the past three quarters," said David L. Smith, who follows the company from Austin, Tex., for the Southcoast Capital Corporation, an investment banking firm.

Trade Fight With Japan Is Widening

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Washington's confrontation with Tokyo widened on two fronts today, as growing signs emerged that Japanese officials were winning allies abroad in the trade struggle while another big American exporter complained about Japan's trade practices.
European officials have condemned the Clinton Administration's decision to place huge tariffs on Japanese luxury car imports as a violation of world trade rules, and today the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, shot back. Mr. Kantor accused the European Union of looking for a free ride in siding verbally with Japan even as it hoped the United States would do the dirty work to open Japanese markets for all. "Our European friends are always willing to hold our coats while we get our nose bloodied," he said. 
 Meanwhile, one of the biggest American success stories in Japan, the Eastman Kodak Company, filed a broad action with the Clinton Administration charging that its film sales in Japan were being undermined by the same sort of collusive practices the United States was battling in the automotive market.
Taken together, the two developments seem bound to increase Japan's resistance to reaching an early settlement with Washington. The actions came on a day in which the Commerce Department reported that America's overall trade deficit of $9.12 billion for March was essentially unchanged from the previous month. But the gap with Japan swelled to $6.14 billion. [Page D4.]
Japanese officials appear to be counting on a broadside of international criticism of the Administration's car sanctions to sow doubts in the Clinton Administration over whether it can win its case before the World Trade Organization in Geneva. At the same time, the action by Kodak seems bound to confirm Tokyo's fear that America's appetite for economic concessions is insatiable. Any agreement to assure United States companies a share of the Japanese auto market, they may reason, will only create a precedent for other industries.
"Everyone realizes this is a much, much broader struggle," one senior Administration official said today. "And neither side is in any mood to blink."
Administration officials said Europe's response to the American action had been expected. Nonetheless, it was damaging to Washington's two-pronged attack on Japan: sanctions against the makers of Japanese luxury cars to prod them into purchasing more American-made parts, combined with a complaint to the newly created World Trade Organization challenging the fundamental structure of the Japanese economy.
The European officials said that the United States, by imposing sanctions on its own, was acting as both prosecutor and judge, sentencing Japanese auto makers before its case against them is presented. By doing so, argued Sir Leon Brittan, the trade commissioner of the European Union, the United States is threatening the world trading system. Even if America's case is solid, Sir Leon said on Wednesday, "to jeopardize the W.T.O.'s credibility so soon after its creation" earlier this year sent the wrong message. Already Japanese officials are fanning out elsewhere in the world, trying to elicit similar critiques.
The European response brought some sharp retorts in Washington today. "The Europeans are acting with great hypocrisy," said Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Affairs.
"They scream that we are acting unilaterally, and then they rush in within minutes to get the benefits of the openings that we achieve," he said. Europeans made similar complaints, he said, when the United States threatened sanctions against China earlier this year for violation of intellectual property rights. Weeks after the case was settled, Europe and China reached a parallel agreement.
"They allege that we are managing trade, while they have concluded their own quota arrangements with the Japanese for autos imported into the E.U.," Mr. Garten said.
On the corporate trade front, Kodak's complaint, seeking an investigation under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, is an unusual one. It comes from a company whose logotype is seen all over Tokyo and whose products are sold widely in Japanese stores. Kodak has 9 percent of the commercial film market in Japan, an impressive figure by most measures.
Kodak argues, however, that the figure would be far higher if the market were unfettered. Although the dollar has weakened by nearly 15 percent, retailers have kept the price of Kodak film artificially high, the company maintains, and its market share is declining. The complaint charges that the Fuji Photo Film Company, which commands 70 percent of the market, has set up a retail system that limits Kodak's sales.
"In this case," the complaint read, "the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Japan Fair Trade Commission have not only tolerated systematic anticompetitive practices, but have actively encouraged and reinforced them."
Mr. Kantor's office has 45 days to decide whether to proceed with an investigation. But it seems highly likely that it will. Kodak's argument -- that the retail system is so controlled by leading Japanese manufacturers that foreign products are discriminated against -- is a clear echo of the auto trade complaint. Kodak also argues that Fuji has created a "profit sanctuary" in Japan, keeping prices high to subsidize its sales abroad, where competition rules.
Kodak, one of the best-known names around the world, has generally been reluctant to file trade complaints. But its new chief executive, George M. C. Fisher, is a veteran of many Japanese trade battles and has argued that the company's market share in Japan should more closely reflect its 40 percent share everywhere else in the world.
