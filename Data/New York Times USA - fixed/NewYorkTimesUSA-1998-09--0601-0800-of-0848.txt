HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF A PRESIDENT;
Suspicion and Resentment in Letters From Lawyers

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from documents released today by the House that show a thinly veiled animosity between the lawyers for the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, and President Clinton over testimony by Mr. Clinton and his aides. They clashed over executive privilege, leaks to reporters, the White House willingness to provide information, the President's schedule and the independent counsel's tactics and the request by his office for a blood sample from the President for DNA testing. 

FEB. 2, 1998
Seeking President's Testimony
 
From Robert J. Bittman, deputy counsel to Mr. Starr, to David E. Kendall, President Clinton's lawyer:
 
David:
As you know, President Clinton has publicly pledged to cooperate fully with the investigation involving Monica Lewinsky. Last Wednesday, January 28, I invited President Clinton, on behalf or the grand jury, to testify before the grand jury this Thursday, February 5, concerning matters relating to Ms. Lewinsky. You indicated in our conversation that you would get back to me as to whether the President will so testify. The grand jury awaits the President's decision; please advise me as soon as possible what the President decides.
Sincerely,
ROBERT J. BITTMAN
 
FEB. 4
Still Waiting for Testimony
 
From Mr. Bittman to Mr. Kendall:
 
David:
Although the President has declined the invitation to testify before the grand jury tomorrow, the grand jury's investigation continues apace. On behalf of the grand jury and in an effort to accommodate the President's schedule, we respectfully invite the President to testify before the grand jury next Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, February 10 to 12.
Sincerely,
ROBERT J. BITTMAN

On Press Leaks
 
From Charles F. C. Ruff, lawyer to the President, to Mr. Starr:
 
Mr. Starr,
This is in response to your letter of February 4, 1998.
First, I want to inform you that within 45 minutes of its delivery, James Bennet of The New York Times called the White House Press Office to ask whether I had received a letter from you concerning executive privilege. Since there could have been only a few persons on your staff who were aware of the letter's delivery, I ask that you immediately request that the F.B.I., using agents not affiliated with your office, investigate to determine who disclosed the existence of the letter and its substance (as well as, presumably, the fact and substance of our meeting) to the press. I and the three members of my staff who were aware of the letter before Bennet's call will be happy to be interviewed (under oath) in connection with any such investigation.
Let me move now to the substance of your letter. As you will not be surprised to learn, I disagree with your position on the applicability of executive privilege to discussions among senior White House staff and between senior staff and the President concerning the Lewinsky matter. . . .
Let me also clarify three points I made in our meeting. First, discussions among and between the President's senior staff involve the very capacity of the President and his staff to govern -- to pursue his legislative agenda, to ensure the continued leadership of the United States in the world community, and to maintain the confidence and support of the people who elected him -- all of which lie at the heart of his role under Article II of the Constitution. Second, as to what position the President himself might take on the assertion of executive privilege as to his communications if he were to be questioned, I did not purport to take any position -- "firm" or otherwise. And third, I indicated that, in deciding whether to assert privilege, we have historically sought to distinguish the substance of advisory and deliberative discussions from segregable facts, not available elsewhere, that may be contained in otherwise privileged communications.
Finally, I remain willing to explore all avenues for resolving our disagreement, although I admit to being more than a little uncertain as to how to conduct discussions without reading about them simultaneously in the press.
Sincerely,
CHARLES F. C. RUFF
 
FEB. 9
The Waiting Continues
 
From Mr. Bittman to Mr. Kendall:
 
David:
Last Wednesday, we, on behalf of the grand jury, extended a second invitation to the President to testify before the grand jury about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. You did not respond to the invitation by last Friday, as requested in my letter. The grand jury's work continues. Notwithstanding your failure to respond, the grand jury would be pleased to accommodate the President's testimony any day or time this week.
Let me make our request specific and clear: the grand jury deserves to know whether the President will respond, favorably, to the invitation. Such an invitation is, of course, fully consistent with our profound respect for the Presidency in our system of separated powers. . . .
Sincerely
ROBERT J. BITTMAN
 
FEB. 13
Invitation Declined
 
From Mr. Kendall to Mr. Bittman:
 
Dear Bob:
This will respond to your letters dated February 4 and 9, 1998. I was unable to respond to your February 4 invitation by the Friday deadline you had indicated in your letter because I was in the process of dealing with prejudicial and false leaks of information about your investigation. . . . These leaks are highly unfair and prejudicial to the President and others, and, as you may know, on Monday I filed a sealed motion with the Chief Judge seeking judicial remedies in an effort to enforce the secrecy and confidentiality of the investigative process.
I acknowledge your invitation for the President to appear before the grand jury next week. The President has the greatest respect for the grand jury. However, under the circumstances, it is impossible to accept this invitation. The situation in Iraq continues to be dangerously volatile, and this has demanded much of the President's time and attention. The President also has a heavy travel schedule at present. Our access to him has necessarily been limited. Moreover, as I informed you during our February 3 telephone conversation concerning this matter, we have simply had inadequate opportunity to prepare so that we may give our client the informed advice of counsel which he, like every other citizen, deserves. Your recent letter references your office's "profound respect for the Presidency in our system of separated powers." However, I am certain that you understand why, in light of the well-publicized and questionable investigative techniques of your office, we feel we would be derelict in our professional duty to a client unless we assured ourselves that we had adequate opportunity to advise that client appropriately.
In the event you decide to "inform the grand jury of this turn of events", as stated in your letter, I would respectfully request that you also read my letter to the grand jury and make my letter part of the grand jury record.
I thank you for your courtesy.
Sincerely,
DAVID E. KENDALL
 
FEB. 17
On Possible Jones Contacts
 
From Mr. Kendall to Mr. Starr, complaining of improper contacts with lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones:
 
Dear Judge Starr:
I write with an inquiry in the wake of a Chicago Tribune article which appeared on February 11 (copy enclosed), and I am making this request in an effort to obtain accurate information so that I may decide how to proceed. The article reports that one of your partners in Kirkland & Ellis, Mr. Richard Porter, may have provided legal advice and services to plaintiff Paula Corbin Jones in her civil suit against President Clinton. The article also reports that someone at the law firm faxed a copy of a draft affidavit in the Jones case to the Tribune prior to the affidavit's filing in court, an action which would, if true suggest that the firm has indeed been involved in the legal prosecution of the Jones case. Finally, the article reports that one of the Jones lawyers Joseph Cammarata received advice from Mr. Porter on several occasions about legal issues in the Jones case. . . .
Additionally, there have been reports of your own participation in legal discussions with Ms. Jones' lawyers, prior to the time you were appointed Independent Counsel.
I hope you can therefore perceive why I am requesting accurate and specific information (i) concerning your own, Mr. Porter's and any other Kirkland & Ellis lawyer's, employees or agent's contacts with and assistance to Ms. Paula Corbin Jones and/or her attorneys or agents or supporting groups, and (ii) concerning what was conveyed to the Attorney General and the Special Division in January, 1998, about any such contacts and assistance, when you sought an expansion of your jurisdiction to encompass the Jones v. Clinton case.
I thank you for your courtesy.
Sincerely,
DAVID T. KENDALL
 
MARCH 4
Too Busy To Testify
 
From Mr. Kendall to Mr. Bittman, responding to a further request that the President appear before the grand jury:
 
Dear Bob:
This will respond to your letters dated February 21 and March 2, 1998. I apologize for my delay in responding. The fault is mine: as you know, we filed a lengthy reply on Friday in the sealed "leaks" matter, responding to your opposition to our original motion for contempt sanctions. That matter simply absorbed my time, but I am now able to give your correspondence the attention it deserves.
As I hope you are aware, the President has the greatest respect for the grand jury. I appreciate your own acknowledgment in your March 2 letter of the "grave duties of state" which are uniquely the President's and the "immense and weighty responsibilities" he must discharge. The buck really does stop with the President for decision-making on a vast range of issues that are critical to this country's safety and economic security.
While it is true that not every moment of the day is absorbed by the duties of office, the President is extraordinarily busy on a range of important public issues, some of which are visible and some of which are not. In our judgment, our ability to have access to the President is simply insufficient at the present time for purposes of representing him adequately in the matters with which you are concerned.
Accordingly, he will, on our advice, not be able to accept your invitation for him to testify at this time. I am certain you would agree that the President deserves the same right to the informed assistance of private counsel as does every other citizen.
Your most recent letter remarks that the situation in Iraq has "thankfully, eased." While there are some respects in which this may be true, the situation remains highly volatile, as a glance at today's newspapers will reveal. The continuing Southeast Asian economic crisis and the Bosnian situation also demand a great deal of the President's time, as do other national security issues, many of which are highly confidential.
On the domestic front, the President's schedule is equally congested. . . . Moreover, as I indicated in my earlier letter, we remain concerned about some of the well-publicized and questionable investigative techniques used by your office. Events of recent days have done nothing to alleviate this concern, and this necessarily affects our judgment as to the degree of preparation necessary to assure the President has adequate and informed legal assistance at the present time. . . .
Sincerely,
DAVID E. KENDALL
 
MARCH 13
Grand Jury Invitations
 
From Mr. Bittman to Mr. Kendall:
 
Dear David:
By your letter last Wednesday, March 4, 1998, the President has now declined five
invitations to testify and tell his story to the grand jury.
As time goes on, now eight weeks into the investigation, your claim that the President continues not to have time to prepare his testimony about Ms. Lewinsky is increasingly difficult for us to understand. We mean no disrespect whatever, mindful as we are of the President's constitutional obligations, but as stated in my letter of March 2, 1998, since the Monica Lewinsky matter began the President has found time to play golf, attend basketball games and political fund-raisers, and enjoy a ski vacation. On Jan. 12, 1998, the President was deposed for nearly a full day in the Jones v. Clinton lawsuit. Your co-counsel, Bob Bennett, has even moved to expedite the trial date in that case. In addition, as you remember, despite the President's weighty responsibilities we had no trouble scheduling the President's depositions for other Whitewater-related matters, and we were able to schedule his testimony the two trials in Little Rock with relative ease. In those trials, of course, he was summoned as a defense witness, not by the United States. . . .
In particular, a deposition format -- should the President refuse his right to present his testimony to the grand jury and face his fellow citizens eye to eye -- is an arrangement we stand ready to discuss. We are ready and able to accommodate any issues of Presidential dignity, as well as security, which of course can be readily accomplished at the United States Courthouse.
Nothing, in short, should stand in the way of the truth's coming out. As should be apparent, we continue to seek -- on behalf of the grand jury -- the President's truthful testimony before that body, which stands ready to sustain any inconvenience in order to respect the President's schedule, while at the same time carrying out its solemn function under our system of law.
Sincerely,
ROBERT J. BITTMAN
 
MARCH 18
The Issue of Cooperation
 
From Mr. Kendall to Mr. Bittman:
 
Dear Bob:
Thank you for your letter dated March 13, 1998. I will be equally frank in response.
For over four years now, the President has cooperated in every possible way with the investigation of the Independent Counsel. He has voluntarily given testimony under oath on three separate occasions to the independent counsel and twice to defendants (on each occasion, he was cross-examined by the independent counsel), he has submitted written interrogatory answers, he has produced more than 90,000 pages of documents, and he has provided information informally in a variety of ways.
I, took have dealt in good faith with your investigation for more than four years. Until the recent expansion of jurisdiction to cover the Lewinsky matter, I have not had occasion to raise, nor have I raised, the kind of concerns I have adverted to in the recent correspondence. I will be more specific: the actions of the Office of Independent Counsel in the past several weeks (as distinct from the actions of the grand jury) led me to believe that your investigation may not, in fact, be an even-handed search for justice but rather may be, for whatever reason, a campaign to embarrass and harass the President. I believe he is now plainly the object of your investigation. . . .
Of more serious concern to us is evidence that your office contrived to obtain the President's deposition testimony through improper and illegal means. Based upon what we have been able to learn thus far (see, e.g., the Page One Washington Post article on February 14, 1998, headlined "Linda Tripp Briefed Jones Team on Tapes"), your office, your agent Linda Tripp, and the Paula Jones lawyers apparently colluded to use the fruits of Tripp's felonious audiotaping (see Md. Code Ann. 10-402 (1997) of Lewinsky against the President at his deposition on Saturday, January 17, 1998. Curiously, Tripp appears to have been given immunity by your office immediately after the contacted you. She then secretly recorded at least one conversation with Lewinsky, an act that (unlike her previous audiotapings) does not appear to have been in violation of wiretap law. According to the Washington Post's February 14 article, Tripp arranged to have Lewinsky apprehended by your agents about noon on Friday, January 16, then put off a meeting with the Jones lawyers until (we believe) it became clear that Ms. Lewinsky would not herself agree to wear a recording device to gather evidence against others. At some point late in the afternoon, Tripp "sent word" to the Jones lawyers that she would talk to them, and she was transported to her home in Maryland (perhaps by one of your agents) where she proceeded to share both the existence of the illegal tapes 1 and their contents with the Jones lawyers, who were able to use this information the next day to question the President.
It appears to us that you did not seek, the Attorney General did not approve, and the Special Division did not authorize the extension of your jurisdiction based on any specific and credible evidence of criminal activity by a covered person.
Again, I would respectfully ask you to read this letter to the grand jury and to make it part of the grand jury record, if your letter to me is shared with the grand jury.
Sincerely,
 DAVID E. KENDALL

About Testifying
 
From Mr. Bittman to Mr. Kendall:
 
Dear David:
I write in response to your letter of March 18, 1998, in which you declined our sixth invitation for the President's testimony, and in response to our meeting of March 20, 1998, during which you declined to answer my question whether the President will ever voluntarily testify about the matters involving Monica Lewinsky.
As you know, upon receipt of your letter I immediately called you to take you up on your offer to meet and discuss our mutual concerns regarding our six invitations to the President. Notwithstanding the numerous misstatements in your letter -- which are addressed herein -- I was hopeful that in light of the President's public pledges of cooperation we could finally arrange terms under which the President would voluntarily testify about the matters involving Ms. Lewinsky. My hopes were dashed at our meeting when you simply refused to discuss any of the "issues." Not only did you merely repeat some of the inflammatory allegations in your letter, you avoided even addressing -- much less answering -- the question I began our meeting with: Will the President ever voluntarily testify about the matters involving Monica Lewinsky? You refused several times to answer this question. . . .
Having tried and tried, I will now try once again. Please give me a straightforward yes or no answer to the following question: Will the President ever agree to testify voluntarily about the matters involving Ms. Lewinsky? If the President chooses again not to give his testimony, so that the grand jury may at least receive some of his evidence, please provide this office with any and all exculpatory evidence you may have.
Sincerely,
ROBERT J. BITTMAN
 
APRIL 17
Objections to Investigation
 
From Mr. Kendall to Mr. Bittman:
 
Dear Bob:
In my several letters and in our meeting, our position could not have been more clearly stated: we have serious objections to the origin and conduct of your Lewinsky investigation until those are satisfactorily addressed, we cannot, as a matter of professional duty to our client, allow the President to give further testimony at the present time. The issue remains open, however, and depends on your Office. . . .
Since your letter states it will address my concerns only "briefly", I will not restate here the issues I have raised at some length in my previous correspondence. I would note only that, once again, your letter stonewalls my request for information concerning contacts between members of the Independent Counsel's law firm (Kirkland & Ellis) and the Paula Jones lawyers as of the Jan. 16, 1998, expansion of your Office's jurisdiction to encompass the Lewinsky matter in the Paula Jones civil suit. My need for this information is obvious: if in fact personnel at Kirkland & Ellis have provided legal assistance in some way to the Jones side of the civil suit, Judge Starr would not have been qualified under the Ethics in Government Act to serve as independent counsel on the Lewinsky matter -- some other individual, with no connection to the Jones litigation, would have had to have been selected.. . .
For over four years, the President has cooperated fully with the investigation of the independent counsel, which has now gone on longer than a Presidential term. He has voluntarily given testimony under oath on three different occasions to the Independent Counsel and twice to defendants (on each occasion, he was cross-examined by the independent counsel), he has submitted written interrogatory answers, he has produced more than 90,000 pages of documents, and he has provided information informally in a variety of ways. This amounts to unprecedented cooperation with an investigation of unprecedented duration. . . .
Sincerely,
DAVID E. KENDALL
 
JULY 17
Invitations Declined
 
From Mr. Bittman to Mr. Kendall:
 
Dear David:
As you know, beginning January 28, 1998, we, on behalf of the grand jury, have invited the President six times to testify voluntarily about the matters involving Monica Lewinsky. Despite his previous cooperation with other aspects of our investigations and his public pledges to cooperate fully with this investigation and provide "more rather than less, sooner rather than later," the President has unfortunately chosen to decline each and every invitation to give his information to the grand jury. The grand jury simply can wait no longer for the President's voluntary cooperation.
Pursuant to 9-11.150 of the United States Attorneys' Manual and with all the requisite approvals thereunder, enclosed please find a subpoena for President Clinton to appear and give testimony before the grand jury on Tuesday, July 28, 1998, at 9:15 a.m. If the president agrees to comply with the subpoena and testify, we and the grand jury -- as we have previously stated -- will accommodate his schedule if he cannot appear on the 28th.
Sincerely,
ROBERT J. BITTMAN
Deputy Independent Counsel
 
JULY 24
Testimony to Grand Jury
From Mr. Kendall to Mr. Bittman:
 
Dear Bob:
I write in response to your letter of yesterday, which I believe to be now moot.
The President is willing to provide testimony for the grand jury, although there are a number of questions relating to the precise terms and timing which must be worked out. If you are willing to work within the framework of the last three times the President provided such testimony and if you are sincere in your statement that you will work to accommodate his schedule, we should quickly be able to finalize the arrangements. . . .
Sincerely,
DAVID E. KENDALL
 
JULY 24
Pleased by Response
 
From Mr. Bittman to Mr. Kendall:
 
Dear David:
We are gratified by your response to my letter of yesterday, and we are pleased by the President's decision to provide testimony for the grand jury.
You indicate in your letter that the President "is willing to provide testimony for the grand jury" and you suggest that such testimony take place in a forum outside the grand jury, on an uncertain future date. We are happy to discuss arrangements for the President's testimony that will be consistent with concerns of security an dignity of the Office of President. . . .
Sincerely,
ROBERT J. BITTMAN
 
JULY 31
A Blood Sample
 
From Mr. Bittman to Mr. Kendall:
 
Dear David:
I telephoned you twice this morning but was unable to reach you. Investigative demands require that President Clinton provide this office as soon as possible with a blood sample to be taken under our supervision. . . . I assure you this information will be kept strictly confidential and will be restricted to a handful of persons on a need-to-know basis only.
Your response to these requests will be greatly appreciated.
Sincerely
ROBERT J. BITTMAN
 
AUG. 3
Yes, With Conditions
 
From Mr. Kendall to Mr. Bittman:
 
Dear Bob:
This letter is written after receiving your second letter dated July 31, 1998, and after our telephone conversation this morning. We agree to provide the blood specimen you have requested (today, if possible), pursuant to the following conditions:
(1) This test, any analysis, our written correspondence, and our oral communications on this issue are all to be treated as highly confidential, subject to the full protections of Rule 6(e), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Both the OIC and we will take the utmost precautions to preserve the confidentiality of this matter.
(2) The sample will be drawn by the White House physician ... , Dr. Connie Mariano, at the White House, in the presence of two representatives of the OIC, under medical procedures acceptable to the OIC. The sample will be immediately furnished to the OIC.
(3) You will execute an affidavit today setting forth your predication evidence for requesting this test, and you will preserve this affidavit in a secure place. You will set forth in the affidavit the evidence you would have presented to Chief Judge Johnson, as represented in your second letter of July 31, 1998.
(4) You will instruct the laboratory that does any analysis related to the specimen we furnish to preserve enough of the item being treated (e.g., any dress of Ms. Lewinsky's) to make possible a later, outside, comparative test of the same type, if appropriate.
I will look forward to receiving a written response to this letter, and we will speak later in the day concerning logistics.
Sincerely,
DAVID E. KENDALL

The Lab Report
 
From the subsequent F.B.I. DNA analysis.
 
Results of Examination:
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profiles for the genetic loci D2S44, D17S79, D1S7, D4S139, D10S28, D5S110 and D7S467 were developed from HaeIII-digested high molecular weight DNA extracted from specimens K39 and Q3243-1 (a semen stain removed from specimen Q3243). Based on the results of these seven genetic loci, specimen K39 (CLINTON) is the source of the DNA obtained from specimen Q3243-1, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. . . .

HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE PRESIDENT;
With Nation Glued to Television, Clinton Sticks With His Peers

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

 BODY:
On a day of high-minded indifference to the disclosure of his grand-jury testimony, President Clinton passed his time yesterday in the consoling company of admiring fellow world leaders, contemplating terrorism, Social Security, the degradation of the oceans and the social safety net in the Netherlands.
He did not mention his grim-faced testimony, and he did not watch any of it either, his aides said. 
 After a speech to the United Nations and lunch with assorted heads of state, President Clinton went to the New York University School of Law to discuss how to strengthen democracy as global markets blur national boundaries. In a room full of aspiring lawyers and accomplished professors, he was not asked about his grand jury experience.
Instead, the President chewed over connections among domestic politics, social issues, economic development, environmental change and other matters with his friend Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of Great Britain; Romano Prodi, the Prime Minister of Italy, and Petar Stoyanov, the President of Bulgaria.
It was the kind of kitchen-table, peripatetic, highbrow gab that Mr. Clinton pioneered in Arkansas and has tried to translate to the world stage as President. In particular, he and Mr. Blair have conducted these sorts of earnest conversations before, but privately, with advisers in Washington and just outside London. This was the first time they treated the public -- for two hours -- to their earnest search to identify the world's looming problems and to define what they call a "third way" in politics.
"We believe in activist government, but highly disciplined," the President said, in trying to explain the concept to the audience in front of him and to that slice of the television audience that was not preoccupied with replays of his grand jury testimony.
Mr. Blair said, "We are witnessing, in effect, the rebirth of progressive politics," which he described as an eagerness for progress combined with a commitment to justice. Mr. Blair credited President Clinton, whom he called Bill, with giving the world "hope and confidence" that powerful nations will intervene to prevent humanitarian disasters.
The four leaders sat in red leather armchairs, with a round wooden table in front of them and an antique, here-there-be-monsters globe at their left. Mr. Clinton led the discussion, sinking back casually in his seat and pointing a finger as he posed questions to his fellow leaders. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who sat in the front row, did not participate, as she has in the private sessions.
The President quickly warmed to the discussion, describing the social safety net in the Netherlands, the needs of the Social Security system in the United States, and one Ugandan village's attempts to use "microcredit," or tiny loans, to build the "infrastructure of civil society." At one point, Mr. Clinton recalled former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's maxim that people may campaign in poetry but must govern in prose, as he turned to Mr. Prodi.
"Romano, what's your biggest domestic challenge?" he asked.
Mr. Prodi replied in his gravelly baritone, "My prose, my prose."
Grinning, the President returned, "Italians never have to speak in prose."
Things got so casual by the late in the session that Mr. Clinton was waving his hands as he offering breezy examples of his efforts to address the degradation of the oceans or to increase financing for research and development into the environment. Sucking on a candy, he said that in response Republicans in Congress "say that it's a Communist plot and they hold hearings on it."
As the audience laughed, Mr. Clinton said that he was trying to make a serious point, that too many policymakers "see an iron law between how much junk you put in the atmosphere and how much your economy grows." Until politicians are convinced that the economy can grow with environmental protection, he said, "we are playing Russian roulette with our children's future."
It was supposed to be a one-day trip to New York to address the United Nations. But the White House stretched it into two and half days of meetings with heads of government. The response Mr. Clinton has got -- including a standing ovation at the United Nations to the affectionate way Mr. Prodi called him Bill -- seemed sure to bolster his mood.
Whenever he has been confronted by scandal, Mr. Clinton has tried to direct attention instead toward his devotion to confronting the problems facing the country. That technique did not work today, at least in the view of White House aides, who were seething over the wall-to-wall broadcast coverage of the President's testimony, which took place on Aug. 17.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said he was not surprised that Mr. Clinton's speech at the United Nations, a call for a global crusade against terrorism, got less news media attention than his testimony. The testimony, he said, "has had that impact of fewer electrons dispersed in the air on that very vital and important subject," he said.
Decrying the release by the Republican Congress of Mr. Clinton's videotaped grand jury appearance, he called yesterday "arguably an unnecessary day in the life of our country, an awful day."
For her part, Mrs. Clinton presided over a two-hour panel discussion at New York University on the topic, Civil Society and the Future of Democracy."
In a room packed with professors, visiting policymakers, law students (and more reporters than usually sit through academic discussions), Mrs. Clinton was greeted with especially loud and long applause. And the other members of her panel took pains to show their regard for her.
In her own short and sober remarks, Mrs. Clinton emphasized the need to nurture citizenship, and to find a new ways to govern at a time when the old ways of governing are no longer effective.
Warning that neither government nor globalization should be blamed as the root of all evil, Mrs. Clinton said, in what sounded very much like a personal creed, that "we have to take the world as we find it and do what we can to improve upon it."

HARNISCHFEGER ABANDONS SALE OF ITS BELOIT SUBSIDIARY

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Harnischfeger Industries Inc., the world's No. 2 manufacturer of paper-making equipment, said yesterday that slowing economic growth worldwide had forced it to suspend efforts to sell its Beloit pulp- and paper-making machinery subsidiary. Harnischfeger, based in Milwaukee, also said it had strengthened its anti-takeover plan by lowering the threshold at which shareholders could buy additional shares, making a takeover prohibitively expensive. Shares of Harnischfeger fell 68.75 cents, to $11.875, their lowest level this decade.

Building Workers Needed

 BODY:
Connecticut economists and industry experts say the exodus of construction workers during the state's recession, combined with a crackdown on unlicensed laborers and a lack of young people entering the field, is increasing construction prices and delaying home repairs.
In July, 63,400 people worked in construction in Connecticut, up 4 percent from the 60,900 people employed in the industry a year earlier. Construction employees earned an average of $833 a week, an increase of 4 percent from the average weekly wage of $801 in July 1997. 
 Through July, Connecticut communities had issued 20 percent more permits for new houses than in the first seven months of 1997. The state will tally about 12,000 housing starts this year, but would have had about 1,000 more if the home-building industry had all the workers it needed, according to Donald Klepper-Smith, an economist with Datacore Partners in Middletown, Conn.

HEADLINE: When a Big Company Hatches a Lot of Little Ideas

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
CHRYSTAL SOFTWARE'S document-processing products were born at the Xerox Corporation, but they sure did not fit there. Xerox can take years to develop a line of copiers; software goes stale in months. And Xerox thinks in terms of billion-dollar businesses. Even R. Steven Kiser, Chrystal's president, concedes that if Chrystal is wildly successful this year, its sales will not top $15 million. "We're not even a blip on Xerox's radar screen," Mr. Kiser said. "If we were still part of Xerox, we'd be killed off."
So why does Chrystal exist? Because two years ago, Xerox started a New Enterprises division whose sole purpose is to keep promising products from falling through corporate cracks. The group spun out Chrystal as a separate company, which Xerox expects to take public next year. 
 Chrystal and eight other companies that New Enterprises is nurturing still turn to Xerox for cash and services like legal advice. But each has its own board and sets its own strategy.
"I have full freedom, yet I don't have to waste time raising capital or building a support staff," Mr. Kiser said.
Xerox's take on it: "There are too many compromises when a new product is buried inside a big company, but that doesn't mean that we should let good products go," said Colin J. O'Brien, the new group's head.
Finally, corporate chiefs are acknowledging that entrepreneurs can breathe life into quirky ideas that, left within bureaucratic companies, would die of neglect or choke on red tape. The result is that corporate America, once considered anathema to all things entrepreneurial, is becoming a birthing ground for start-up businesses.
Often the big companies let fledgling firms buy into their benefits programs, use their lawyers and other support staff and drop their name with customers. But the small companies manage their own budgets, design their own compensation plans, usually heavily weighted toward equity rather than salary, and live or die by their own decisions.
The arms-length relationship seems to work for both sides. "Entrepreneurs have a passion to succeed under any circumstances, and they'll do even better without a corporate safety net," said Robert S. Sullivan, the dean of the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina.
For the Xeroxes of the world, meanwhile, spinning out ventures is a relatively risk-free way to participate in new technologies without weakening their concentration on main product lines. "It's always better to throw out a lot of seeds and see what comes up," said AnnaLee Saxenian, a professor in the College of Environmental Design at the University of California, Berkeley.
Indeed, Professor Saxenian's research shows that one reason California's Silicon Valley has thrived more than that of Route 128, its high-tech counterpart near Boston, is that Silicon Valley firms have been generating a stream of start-ups. No one, not even the Small Business Administration, has quantified the spinoff trend yet. But anecdotal evidence is piling up. A few examples:
* Last year Lucent Technologies, a telecommunications company that took Bell Laboratories with it when it spun out from AT&T in 1996, started a new ventures group to nurture an assortment of products like high-definition television signals, electronic fingerprint identification and a technology that speeds responses to 911 calls. "Bell Labs still does a lot of research that isn't focused on our core businesses but has a lot of commercial potential," said Thomas M. Uhlman, the new group's president.
* In 1996 Hewlett-Packard Company, which shut its database-software business a year earlier, let some employees form a spin-out company, Timesten, around one particularly promising data-searching technology. Hewlett let an outside entrepreneur license a product in which computers read and transmit handwritten notes. Hewlett owns a stake in Timesten and receives royalties from the outsider. "We were tired of sending technologies to a watery grave just because none of our divisions wanted to commercialize them," said Joel S. Birnbaum, the director of HP Laboratories.
* The Thermo Electron Corporation, which started in 1956 as an energy company, has evolved into an incubator for companies in fields as disparate as health care, environment and analytical instruments. As soon as a product or a technology looks like it can go alone, Thermo Electron sells up to half of it on the public markets and uses the money it raises to develop other promising technologies. "Our core business has become generating new businesses," said John N. Hatsopoulos, the president of Thermo Electron, which has nudged two dozen fledgling companies out of the corporate nest.
EVEN the Federal Government has got into the act. As part of their move away from weapons research, many of the Department of Energy's laboratories have let employees start companies that commercialized technologies developed at those same labs.
For example, Rocky Flats, the former plutonium production plant outside Denver, has spawned companies that are working on products as diverse as optical communications and a vaccine to combat AIDS. Oak Ridge National Laboratories in Tennessee has turned a former uranium-enrichment plant into what is now called the East Tennessee Technology Park, which is currently home to start-up companies, many using Oak Ridge technologies. Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque has given rise to 60 companies.
"As long as a technology isn't classified, it's best to license it to an employee who will run with it," said Dan L. Hartley, Sandia's vice president for laboratory development.
Why is this happening now? Every decade has its managerial catch phrases, and the favorites in the 1990's have been "core competency" and "leadership position." The going theory is that companies should play only in their strongest products and technologies, that is, stick to their core competencies, and where they can dominate their market. What that means is that no product, no matter how intriguing, has a shot at development dollars unless it is a strategic fit.
Companies have also spent the decade wringing every last drop out of costs, and are now looking for other ways to rev up income. One easy way is to let employees, or even outsiders, take over unused patents or finish half-done research projects in exchange for royalties or shares in the new firm. "They just lose a small stake if the spin-out fails, but they have a potentially huge upside if it works," observed Rita McGrath, a management professor at the Columbia Business School.
And in trying to hurry their own products to market, companies have been forming numerous joint ventures and so-called strategic partnerships with suppliers, customers, even competitors. Psychologically, that makes it easier for once-insular companies to let new technologies out the door.
Polaroid is a case in point. The photography giant has traditionally played all its technological cards close to the vest. So when David V. Cronin, a Polaroid engineer, invented a way to control electrostatic discharge on computer hard drives, Polaroid tried to take it to the market itself. "They didn't have a clue how to commercialize it," Mr. Cronin recalled, so the company shelved the product.
As recently as two years ago, it would have stayed shelved. But Mr. Cronin, sensing a more open atmosphere, persuaded Polaroid to let him contact venture capitalists. The result is Cro-Bar (for Cronin barrier), a stand-alone company built around the new product that pays royalties to Polaroid. Mr. Cronin stayed with Polaroid ("I'm 65, I don't want to work an entrepreneur's hours anymore," he explained), but invested in the start-up.
THE ways in which corporations spin off small companies vary as widely as the companies themselves. Some, like Thermo Electron, take them public but hold onto a majority of the shares. Some, like Xerox, keep them private and hold onto 80 percent of the equity, reserving the choice to take them public later. Some, like Polaroid, take no equity position at all.
They also differ in the amount of help they offer. Thermo Electron asks its spin-out companies to carry 0.8 percent of its general administration costs on their books in exchange for investor relations, health insurance and other services. Xerox charges each spin-out 1 percent of its sales in exchange for access to support functions. "It's a real boon to get critical pieces of infrastructure at such favorable rates," said Ramana Rao, the chief technology officer of Inxight Software, which broke away from Xerox early last year.
Hewlett, in contrast, provides little cushioning or staff support to its spin-outs. "We don't want them to feel they can have a soft landing," Mr. Birnbaum said.
The entrepreneurs say the umbilical cords are a mixed blessing. Some note that it is harder to attract good talent when would-be employees know that their company is majority-owned by a ponderous corporation. Others say they sometimes feel locked into occupying suboptimal space in the parent's headquarters, or are using corporate services not really attuned to their needs. And many miss the expertise they may get from a more narrowly focused venture capitalist.
But most say the pros outweigh the cons. "Almost everything we've done would have been possible without Lucent's support," said Andreas C. Papanicolaou, the president of Lucent Digital Video, Lucent's high-definition television venture. "But it would all have been harder. Add a lot of hard things together and it gets almost impossibly difficult."

HEADLINE: When the Suits Can Save Your Shirt

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

 BODY:
DEBORAH L. JACOBS, lawyer-turned-writer, gave a heartfelt compliment to the young man who arrived with his helper to clean her house in Brooklyn recently: the name of his service was awfully clever. But she wasn't going to leave it at that. "Have you trademarked it?" she asked.
He had not, he told Ms. Jacobs, who happened to be the author of "Legal Smarts for Small Business." And that answer worried her, enough that she will not disclose the name of the young entrepreneur's business until he has finished scurrying around to obtain trademark protection. After all, a name that isn't trademarked can be used by someone else unless the first person brings out expensive legal artillery to stop the competition. 
 It was just one example, Ms. Jacobs said, of how small-business owners forge ahead optimistically, figuring that nothing can go wrong, when they should part with a few hundred dollars, or a few thousand depending on the legal task, for a lawyer who, by training and temperament, can anticipate everything going wrong. "How far can an entrepreneur get without a lawyer?" she said. "Pretty far. But it can cost you a lot, a whole lot, later."
Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new business. Neither are accountants, investment advisers or other professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things entrepreneurs would rather not think about.
"That's the typical entrepreneurial attitude," said Fred S. Steingold, a lawyer in Ann Arbor, Mich., and the author of "The Legal Guide for Starting and Running a Small Business."
"They want to get along with their business, and they're not detail-oriented," he said. "They're impatient. That's what makes them good entrepreneurs."
Some tiny service businesses, of course, start and run fine without professional advice; a dog walker or a window washer can obtain a business license (and probably should in many cities, for tax reasons), file a Schedule C and never pay for a consultation.
Even in a retail or a professional business, Ms. Jacobs said, "as a sole proprietor you can absolutely hang out your shingle without consulting a lawyer, although if you're operating out of your house you might want to check the zoning rules."
But any other form of ownership -- partnership and any type of corporation -- requires legal and probably accounting guidance.
On the complexity scale, the simplest is a partnership, which most experts say should begin with a written agreement spelling out, for example, what happens if one owner dies or quits the business. This is well-charted territory, especially since the Uniform Partnership Act governs in almost all states, and by following legal guides for the general public and form books that contain standard agreements, most people can do the paperwork and whatever modifications they want.
But even Mr. Steingold, whose publisher, Nolo Press, produces self-help books and software, suggests that a lawyer review an agreement. He gives the same advice for forming a simple corporation -- with the preliminary note that owners might want to first ask a lawyer whether they need to incorporate. (The main advantage, ordinarily, is protection of the individual owners from legal liabilities. There are tax advantages and disadvantages, too, best sorted out by an accountant.)
The paperwork -- state filing papers, articles of incorporation and shareholder provisions -- is manageable for most people; Nolo Press, among others, publishes general guides and versions specific to several states, including New York and California.
Having a lawyer review the documents is fairly painless: in Mr. Steingold's case, about an hour of his time, or $175. For handling the whole process, his flat fee in most cases is $600. (In big cities, where costs are generally higher, charges can run as high as $2,000.)
As for buying a business, whatever you plan to do, Mr. Steingold said, self-education and self-representation won't work. "You need advice on whether to buy the assets or just the corporate shell," he said. "The typical purchase agreement is pretty complicated. There are all kinds of decisions about how it's going to be financed. Then there are 10 to 20 documents that show up at a closing."
Some people, he said, will come into a lawyer's office with a proposed sales contract that originated with the seller or came from a form book, "but it would be difficult for somebody who doesn't have any legal experience to go through a closing."
Do-it-yourself accounting is not recommended either, but entrepreneurs can keep bills down by doing the prep work. Software programs offer simplified bookkeeping tasks and enable people to monitor cash-flow statements and projections.
Anyone starting a business should be thoroughly immersed in those numbers anyway, said Ginny Beauchamp, the vice president of the National Association for the Self-Employed in Washington. Still, Ms. Beauchamp added, however small the business, "having an accountant do audits a couple times a year is a very good idea, and if your business is growing by leaps and bounds, obviously you need help."
ONLY the simplest sole proprietorships can do without accountants for tax planning and preparation. Businesses can get in trouble for failing to keep up with changes in tax law, as many did several years ago when they failed to amend their Keough plans. Perhaps a quarter of small-business owners were delinquent in filing new plans with the Internal Revenue Service, many because they were unaware of the new requirement.
Ms. Jacobs said small-business owners, whether through cost-consciousness or hopeful ignorance, make two mistakes in circumventing lawyers.
First, she said, they wave off legal advice until they are in trouble. She mentioned the entrepreneur who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars making a CD-ROM called "The First Electronic Jewish Bookshelf." His product brought a warning letter from Microsoft, which was using the term "bookshelf." At that point, the entrepreneur had to get a lawyer and enter extremely expensive settlement negotiations.
Second, she said, "many attempt to play amateur lawyer." Ms. Jacobs recommends self-help books to pare legal costs and identify business concerns. Nolo's, she advised, "are very well researched and well written and provide great background." Even after practicing law for six years, she does not hesitate to hire others.
"When I need a specialized kind of legal help, I hire the best expert I can," she said. "I would no sooner be an amateur in the legal field than I would be an amateur electrician and rewire my house."
One problem with drafting legal documents is simply finding a helpful standard form. States vary in their use of common terms as well as in their substantive laws, and as a result the forms "get very generalized and watered down," Mr. Steingold said.
He should know. He wrote a form book himself, as a companion volume to the legal guide for small businesses. It includes, among others, employment contracts, commercial lease forms, purchase agreements and tax forms. But somebody taking a form from a book, he said, "would need to get local counsel to look at it."

Putting a Funky Face on Wall Street

BYLINE: By EDWARD LEWINE 

 BODY:
TWO men in ponytails and a woman with a bleached-blond crew cut were hanging out in their sparsely decorated Internet consulting firm at 11 Broadway in lower Manhattan. Their upstairs neighbor, the president of an Internet company had just stopped by. He had sideburns to his chin.
"We were comparing notes about people in the building," explained Mary Olson of Transition Networks, as Paul Guzyk, the president of Infohouse, which provides access to the Internet as well as networking services, headed back to the ninth floor. "We do that sometimes." 
 Just two years ago, Transition Networks didn't exist, Infohouse was operated from an East Village bedroom and 11 Broadway was almost empty. But these days they are all thriving, thanks, in part, to Plug 'n' Go, a program that has put 151 new-media entrepreneurs into 400,000 square feet of cheap, well-wired offices in six buildings south of City Hall.
Industry experts credit the program with giving a funky, creative edge to Wall Street, where nose rings and chunky shoes are now seen among the Brooks Brothers suits, and with helping the growth of Silicon Alley, a loosely defined area downtown that has been popular with new-media companies for the last few years.
The New York Media Association, a trade group, estimated that there were 2,600 new-media companies in 1997. "I think Plug 'n' Go is one reason the industry is doing so well here," said Brian Horey, the association's director. "I would like to see it expanded."
But Plug 'n' Go has not been the only impetus to luring new-media contenders to the end of Manhattan, others say. "Silicon Alley happened despite government, not because of it," said Tom Watson of @NY, an on-line news service catering to local new-media businesses. "Plug 'n' Go was a reaction to what was already happening."
The program was started in February 1997 by the Alliance for Downtown New York, a nonprofit business improvement group, with help from the city and landlords. It was designed to help that part of New York recover from the loss of about 100,000 jobs in the early 90's, which left commercial buildings in the Wall Street area only a quarter full.
Sharon Greenberger, who manages the program, said the only business that had been growing downtown was information technology. So the Alliance tried to encourage young new-media companies, the Internet and other computer-related services to move in.
"These companies needed three things," Ms. Greenberger said, "cheap rent, easy connection to the Internet and short-term, flexible leases."
So Ms. Greenberger persuaded the owners of six semivacant buildings to offer small spaces at $15 a square foot (20 percent below market rate then) and to wire the offices for computers and T-1 lines and contract with an Internet provider.
Mr. Guzyk said the program has helped Infohouse, which began with two employees in 1995, to grow to 10 employees and a yearly gross of $1 million. "We can do things in this building much easier than if we were in a typical midtown building," he said.

HEADLINE: Making a Good Idea Her Own

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
HONEYMOONING on the beaches of Ibiza, an island off the southeastern coast of Spain, Dalia Almanza-Smith had what she calls an epiphany: the germ of an idea for a business that changed her life and helped to introduce postcards as a new form of advertising in America.
To be fair, she says, it was not her idea. She copied it from the bars and restaurants she visited during her European honeymoon four years ago and quickly adapted it to the American way -- bigger, bolder and better. 
 This is how it happened, she says, leaning closer across the table at a trendy bar here and clearly enjoying retelling the story of how she became an entrepreneur:
One day as she was leaving a French restaurant, she noticed a small rack of colorful postcards and picked one up. "What are these?" she asked a bartender.
"Take them, they're free," he told her.
"Why are they free?" she insisted.
The man shrugged. She turned the card around and realized what it was. "My God, this is advertising!" she said, showing it to her husband, Ron Smith, an executive with a management-consulting firm in Virginia. At the time, she was the advertising director for a Hispanic magazine.
"I was taken with the idea then," said Ms. Almanza-Smith, now a 38-year-old on her way to becoming a millionaire. "Advertising is what I know, and I knew that I had never seen anything like that."
After the episode in the bar, she says, she and her husband would lie on the beach and instead of planning their new life together, planned a new business.
By the time they came home two months later, they decided to use their savings and credit cards, about $40,000 altogether, to start a business they thought was new on this side of the Atlantic: using catchy postcards to push everything from milk to pantyhose in restaurants and bookstores. They even had a name, Frankie Freecards.
Ms. Almanza-Smith quit her job and, armed with years of reading Entrepreneur magazine, began working on the business plan. She soon discovered that at least two other people had been to Europe that summer, stumbled on the same idea and had started their own postcard businesses.
Undaunted, Ms. Almanza-Smith approached them with the notion of joining forces to minimize costs and offer wider distribution to clients. They formed a company and called it Go Card.
THE beginning was difficult, she admits. She called on restaurants and bookstores and, showing them a few faded cards from her trip, asked them to let her to put a rack with similar postcards on their walls.
"I kept telling them, 'It will be really pretty, I promise,' Ms. Almanza-Smith explained. "It was a total conceptual sale. I also told them I would have the cards in 30 days when, in reality, I had nothing."
Armed with contracts from the businesses, she then visited advertisers and, offering free cards or low rates, filled the racks.
By 1995, the business had taken off with clients in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington. Last year, with 400 clients and displays in more than 2,000 locations in 11 cities, the company had nearly $5 million in total revenue.
Just a few months ago, Ms. Almanza-Smith took her part of the business from Go Card, renamed it Hot Stamps and forged a partnership with Network Event Theater, a company in New York. She remains in charge of her company in Virginia but, through the New York partner, distributes her postcards to most of the major American cities.
She says her goal is to have a rack with her cards everywhere in the country.
"When I started with Go Card, I did not believe it would work," she said. "But once it did, it motivated me to do more. There is no way to stop me now."
Ms. Almanza-Smith attributes some of her pluckiness to her genes and her heritage. She was born in Mercedes, a small town in the southernmost tip of Texas, to Mexican-American parents. Her father owned an auto-parts business and her mother returned to college in her 40's to study business administration. "If she had the courage to sit next to 17- and 18-year-olds in the classroom, I had to have the courage to start a business," Ms. Almanza-Smith said.
As a Hispanic woman, she says, she also learned to rely on her own talents to succeed. She and her mother were the first women in the family to go to college.
"I learned early on that I had to persevere in whatever I got into because I had no other options," she said. "I was not going to inherit any money. I was not going to naturally follow any kind of family tradition or business. I had to invent myself."
That philosophy appears to be shared by many Hispanic women in the United States. Debra Silimeo, a deputy associate administrator of the Small Business Administration in Washington, who said that the rate of growth for businesses started by Hispanic women is 114 percent, compared with and average growth rate for all businesses of 26 percent.
Outwardly, success has not changed Ms. Almanza-Smith much. She still lives in the same house in suburban Falls Church, Va., and wears jewelry that only looks expensive. She said that she and her husband prefer to spend their newly acquired wealth by helping their extended families and taking them on their vacations abroad.
Just a few months ago, Ms. Almanza-Smith splurged on what she had always considered a luxury: she hired a gardener to plant flowers all over her yard.

HEADLINE: Where the Future May Be a Table Away

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: WOODSIDE, Calif.

 BODY:
JOHN SHOCH, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, scans the room at Bucks, a folksy cafe in this affluent bedroom community, and notes that he recognizes about half the financiers, hardware engineers and software hackers who are seated, eating breakfast.
Mr. Shoch is doing what he does best. He calls it "surfing": looking for the next big thing in the nation's technology heartland. He is a key player in a remarkably efficient system that brings together vast pools of capital and good ideas. 
 There are signs everywhere in Silicon Valley that the region is no longer an unconnected bunch of competitors located near the Stanford University campus, which gave birth to the valley's first company, Hewlett-Packard Company.
Instead, changing jobs in Silicon Valley Inc. is now as simple as turning into a new driveway on the way to work, or as simple an idea as the newly created garage.com, which matches entrepreneurs with venture-capital firms.
A walk down University Avenue in Palo Alto, increasingly the valley's brain center, will take you past the brand-new offices of Accel Partners, one of the valley's premier venture-capital firms. The partners are upstairs; downstairs, "entrepreneurs-in-residence" are busy incubating start-ups.
This financing mechanism has created the semiconductor chip, the digital watch, video games, the personal computer and most recently the commercial Internet. Indeed, Silicon Valley is now a result of Moore's Law, the industrial process first described by the Intel Corporation co-founder Gordon Moore, which dictates that every 18 months chipmakers will be able to double the number of transistors on a given sliver of silicon.
Although it wasn't obvious until recently, Moore's Law is dictating that change here is exponential. The reason is easy to explain: exponential change is described by the graph of an arc that begins slowly on a horizontal plane and then almost instantly skyrockets vertically.
That is why time in the valley seems so compressed. This is evident from the exploding megahertz ratings of microprocessor chips to the ballooning megabyte storage capacities of memory chips and disk drives, making everything move faster at an ever-increasing rate. Around the valley it is best described as living on Internet time.
For Mr. Shoch, whose firm, Asset Management, has just completed a $100 million-plus fund, these are both heady and nervous times.
Surfing, in Mr. Shoch's parlance, means catching the next big wave of technology innovation. And despite the fact that there are more and more billions of venture-capital dollars flowing into the valley each year, it is complicated. (The recent stock-market jitters have left venture capitalists here nervous but still enthusiastic; in short, holding their breath.)
While the pace of change has become predictable, charting the direction of change is still an art form.
"Sometimes you'll paddle furiously to catch a wave that fails to materialize," Mr. Shoch said. "While at other times the wave will appear suddenly and you'll find yourself paddling just as furiously to try to catch it before it leaves you behind."
Some Silicon Valley venture capitalists have made their reputation by finding and riding a certain wave. For example, in 1989 John Hummer and Ann Winblad established the first venture-capital firm to focus exclusively on software companies, just when the software industry was blossoming.
And there are legendary figures, like John Doerr, a partner at Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers. Mr. Doerr has had the knack of making the best investments spanning three eras: personal computers, workstations and the Internet.
Sometimes venture capitalists will try to force the next wave by jump-starting financing for whole groups of companies. A classic model is the $100 million fund created several years ago by Kleiner, Perkins to finance companies that were starting businesses based on the Java programming language.
This tactic can also lead to blind alleys, catastrophic bad timing and unexpected twists and turns. As an example, everyone in Silicon Valley has believed for years that the next big thing would be an ultralight portable computer.
In fact, almost all of the valley's best thinkers have been inspired by the work of a small group of computer researchers led by the industry pioneer Alan Kay at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center 25 years ago. The researchers proposed "Dynabook," a powerful two-pound, wireless computer connected to a global network of computer databases.
Sound obvious?
It did; it also appeared to be simple. Yet more than a dozen of Silicon Valley's most fabled catastrophes -- with company names like Grid, Gavilan, Momenta, Go, Io and Slate -- have foundered because neither the timing nor the technology was right. In today's economy, you need to have both elements working simultaneously.
MORE recently, in the early 1990's, everyone -- Silicon Valley venture capitalists to cable-industry tycoons and Redmond, Wash.-based software moguls -- was convinced that the next big thing would be interactive digital television. The vision was that the TV would become the portal for the information revolution. Happy families would sit in their living rooms in front of their TV's and bank, shop, communicate with other people and be entertained. The living room has so far not proven to be the right place for interacting with the Internet.
Missteps like these have led to absurdities like a Florida market trial in which a Silicon Valley company tried to hook up TV sets to computer workstations that had been fine-tuned to pump movies and digital information into homes. The concept failed because the computer workstations cost more than many families want to spend: $25,000 each.
The lesson, of course, is that in Silicon Valley the term "visionary" usually describes a job title and not an ability. If you pressure venture capitalists over a meal at Il Fornaio in Palo Alto, they will confess that they expect a shakeout and acknowledge that they are concerned about the huge capital flows coming into the valley.
One consequence can be seen in the remarkable appreciation of the value of new deals -- there is just too much money chasing too few great ideas.
But for the moment the risks seem to be outweighed by the incredible opportunities inspired by the emergence of cyberspace. While everyone was looking the other way, the Internet sneaked up on Silicon Valley and sent the venture-capital community racing to finance start-ups like Netscape Communications, Yahoo, Excite, Infoseek and Amazon.
The rise of the Internet has cranked up the valley's economy to a feverish pitch. Companies like Apple Computer and Sun Microsystems have been reinvigorated by the boom in Internet commerce. There are so many new companies being formed that initial public offerings are no longer the typical outcome for a start-up.
There are more than five times as many companies created each year as there are available I.P.O. dollars. Consequently, acquisition has become an endgame for most start-ups, according to Technologic Partners, a firm that monitors venture capital in Silicon Valley.
That in turn has made the valley even more of a technology hothouse, attracting a new kind of venture backer -- large technology companies like AT&T, Lucent, Intel and Microsoft.
Indeed, although Intel executives once referred to the valley's venture community as "vulture capitalists" because they would entice employees away to start to new chip ventures, the company is now running the valley's largest venture fund, valued at more than $300 million annually.
Yet despite the boom-time atmosphere, there are signs that the Internet wave is cresting and that Silicon Valley is entering one of those periods between new technologies and new industries.
Today there is no certainty about the next big thing after the Internet, but everyone is looking. Is it wireless data or is the time finally right for interactive digital television? There are some who believe they see signs the next wave is on the horizon.
Richard Shaffer, the president of Technologic Partners, which conducts market research and conferences, recently changed the title of one of his annual conferences from "PC Outlook" to "Technology Outlook."
The reason, he said, is that he has detected a renewed interest in the venture community in basic sciences and new technologies. If so, it would be a significant departure from the last five years. "I haven't heard talk about basic physics and optical electronics in a long time," Mr. Shaffer said.
Which might suggest that the valley is on the brink of one of those epochal shifts, perhaps from the world of electronic to optical computing. Such a shift has been predicted for many years by some of the valley's best thinkers. The world of optical computing is much more in tune with the communications-rich future that now seems all around.
The common wisdom here, however, is that any new invention is subject to the "15-year" rule: it usually takes at least 15 years for a new technology to make it from the laboratory to the market.
In a world where timing is everything -- the right investment at the wrong moment can be just as disastrous as making the wrong bet -- a venture capitalist can be left with a lot of sleepless nights, even in the best of times.

HEADLINE: Heeding the Siren Call to Do Your Own Thing

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
MY father told the story over and over. He was a young and energetic broker employed by a big textile company, an immigrant's son prospering for the first time, when his boss summoned him one day and said that because of corporate setbacks, my father would have to accept a wage cut.
He refused. Impetuously, he and another young broker resigned, rented an office on Worth Street, then the center of the textile industry in Manhattan, and within a year they were earning more than they ever had. They not only brokered trades in cotton cloth, but purchased cloth themselves, gambling on resale at quick profits. "Taking a position," my father called it. He loved the risk. 
 My father was an entrepreneur or, more precisely, he exhibited some of the characteristics of an entrepreneur. The concept -- to break with routine, to innovate, to seize an opportunity, to develop something new -- is as old as capitalism. But the word itself and the characteristics it suggests have become popular among Americans only in the last 15 years as everyone, not just immigrants and their children, struggles for a place in a rapidly changing, increasingly competitive economy.
Responding to the demand, graduate business schools are initiating courses on how to be an entrepreneur, although the lectures are not nearly as specific as those in a statistics class or a management theory course. And corporate America is spending billions of dollars on the restless, entrepreneurial endeavor to develop popular new products or to rejigger old ones to boost sales.
Only a volatile stock market threatens to curtail this energy by depriving entrepreneurs, particularly small entrepreneurs, of some of the financing they need to carry out their ideas. Big companies have more cash savings to draw on and easier access to credit.
"Entrepreneurial activity became a concern to the general public in the 1980's, when we all thought that the United States was falling behind, and that the rest of the world, particularly Japan, would sink us," said William J. Baumol, an economist and historian at New York University. "As soon as people started worrying about this, they said that Japan was entrepreneurial and America had lost the spirit of entrepreneurship. And we began self-consciously to reacquire that spirit."
My father, getting started in the 1920's, never thought of himself as an entrepreneur and did not use that word. For him, opportunity and prosperity meant self-employment. The bold, risky act of going out on his own became, in hindsight, his heroic moment; each time he told the story, his children listened respectfully. He was proud of a journalist son who worked for a big wire service and then a big newspaper. But he wondered all his life why that son did not itch to start his own newspaper or buy one. For him, the entrepreneurial spirit, a term coming into vogue in his final years, resided exclusively in energetic small-business owners.
Small business has a role, of course. Starting a business, being your own boss, risking your savings, operating with high energy -- all these characteristics appear in the evolving definition of the entrepreneurial spirit, first described in the early 1800's by Jean-Baptiste Say, a French economist. But innovation and invention are its essence. And while a Sam Walton (Wal-Mart) or a Steven Jobs (Apple) or a James Clark and Marc Andreessen (Netscape) still emerge from the ranks of the lone-wolf entrepreneurs, innovation and invention occur as often today in big companies as in small ones. More often, probably.
"What has happened is that entrepreneurial innovation has become the prime competitive weapon, and industry can no longer wait for the occasional geniuses to come along with something new," Mr. Baumol said. "Companies have had to routinize invention and innovation. And the big companies have the money to do this."
Merck & Company, the giant pharmaceutical corporation, certainly does. Its scientists, who develop drugs at Merck's laboratories, are encouraged to take on the additional task of scouting outside the company -- through journals, newspapers, universities and friends -- for promising new research or new technologies that might lead to the development of a future drug. When they find this promising outside research -- to fight prostate disease, for example -- they make their case to a Merck board for money to finance or to buy the outside research or to form a partnership.
"An entrepreneur to me," said Bennett M. Shapiro, the executive vice president of Merck's worldwide basic research, "is someone who picks up something not going on at Merck, but is important to the future development of a drug, and then makes the case for why we should fund a relationship, as if he were an independent entrepreneur appealing to venture capitalists for money."
Not all of Merck's 5,000 scientists are so entrepreneurial, but those who are, and succeed in bringing valuable research to Merck, get handsome payoffs in stock options. Through two centuries of capitalism, the hope of a big payoff has driven entrepreneurs.
Similarly, Sealed Air Corporation, with 14,000 employees and $2.5 billion in annual sales, encourages its people to bring entrepreneurial proposals directly to T. J. Durmot Dunphy, the chairman, and other top executives -- going around the hierarchy to reach them when necessary. The goal is rapid corporate growth, another key characteristic of the modern entrepreneurial spirit, and Mr. Dunphy achieves it partly through his unorthodox reporting system.
Sealed Air's principal product is plastic air-bubble packaging, which cushions fragile products during shipment. Fast growth (Mr. Dunphy's company had only $5 million in annual sales when he took over in 1971) has come through the new forms of packaging developed at Sealed Air and through acquisitions.
"We are trying to expand quickly in Latin America," Mr. Dunphy said. "A conventional company would send its corporate development people, who would go about the task in some routine way. But the general manager of our Spanish subsidiary called me and said his operation was running well and he had time. He flies to Latin America once a month, and in six months he has purchased one company and is negotiating for another. I call that entrepreneurial."
But for all the entrepreneurial flexibility now evident in big companies, millions of Americans appear to believe that the entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies; that is, owner-operated companies with fewer than 100 employees. The great attention focused on Silicon Valley start-ups feeds this view. So do venture capitalists, who buy into the start-ups, hoping that their innovative products will run up big sales, quickly raising the value of the venture capitalist's investment.
The Small Business Administration and the National Federation of Independent Business, a powerful Washington lobbying group representing small companies, also foster the perspective that small companies are the chief source of entrepreneurial activity. For this reason, among several others, small companies should get Government support in the form of special tax breaks and special exemptions from some regulations. Or so the argument goes.
"In the rawest sense of entrepreneurial," said William Dennis, the federation's director of research, "if I establish a new firm, I have taken an entrepreneurial act. I have acted in the belief that I know something others don't, and I am exploiting an advantage others do not have."
That is an appealing thought at a time when self-employment is a big phenomenon, particularly among immigrants and among workers who have been laid off by corporations. By this definition, a Korean immigrant, for example, is entrepreneurial if he sets up a flower kiosk on a street corner, acting on an insight that, in his view, a competitor on the opposite corner has failed to grasp. He is acting on the belief that he will draw more customers because his new kiosk is closer than his competitor's to a bus stop.
"Entrepreneurship is a state of mind, a can-do attitude, a capacity to focus on a vision and work toward it," said Barry Rogstad, the president of the American Business Conference, whose membership consists of quickly growing corporations still operated by their founders.
Most economists agree that starting a business -- gambling your savings and going into debt to follow your "vision" -- is entrepreneurial. But if the Korean immigrant's kiosk survives and he then presides over a routine daily operation, as most small business owners do, is he still entrepreneurial?
The answer is no, unless he regains that status by giving his operation another entrepreneurial kick. David Allen, who founded Allen Associates in the Boston suburb of Ayer, fits this pattern.
Soon after earning an engineering degree 35 years ago, Mr. Allen began a company to manufacture and sell a wire-and-sponge device that he had invented and patented to keep corsages moist. The device sold, and for 20 years, he earned a steady five-figure income. His entrepreneurial start-up faded into a nonentrepreneurial, day-to-day operation. "I did not have a problem with that," Mr. Allen said recently. "Just running a business was enjoyment enough."
But not for his wife. When their two sons became teen-agers in the early 80's, Marie Allen joined her husband, bringing to the enterprise a background in, and a yen for, marketing. She soon hit on a way to increase sales revenues from the 600 wholesale florists who were her husband's customers.
Traveling to regional trade shows, Mr. Allen said: "We look for promising new products that people are trying to introduce into the floral industry, but cannot manage to sell. Marie takes them to market with our products; we currently are selling 25 different items to our customers."
Annual revenue for the Allens has nearly quadrupled to $1.1 million from $300,000, when Mrs. Allen came aboard 15 years ago, and it has reawakened the family business.
From Adam Smith's day, the entrepreneurial spirit, in one guise or another, has been a huge source of change and expansion for the capitalist market system. The great early-20th century economist, Joseph A. Schumpeter, gave the concept its modern, expansive twist, defining an entrepreneur as someone who breaks with routine.
The entrepreneurial function, he wrote, "does not essentially consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the conditions which the enterprise exploits. It consists in getting things done" right down to "making a success of a particular kind of sausage or toothbrush."

HEADLINE: Their Businesses May Be Small, But Their Ambitions Rarely Are

BYLINE: By BRENT BOWERS 

 BODY:
EVEN as children, many of them spotted a business angle nobody else did, and milked it for all it was worth.
At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a health-care information-services company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., figured he could make more money if he hired playmates to shovel driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the $5 he collected and even had the presence of mind to ply his trade outside his neighborhood so that the mothers wouldn't catch on to his scheme. 
 Before he was out of high school, Mr. Blue owned and operated two drug stores.
As a boy growing up in a village in India 100 miles north of New Delhi, Vinod Gupta, the founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of business information in Omaha with projected sales this year of $250 million, caught frogs at a swamp and sold them to a research laboratory for lunch money. In college, he rented entire passenger-train cars to make a 36-hour trip to New Delhi, and then sold seat tickets individually for a quick 25 percent profit.
Donald J. Dalton, the founder of the Micro Overflow Corporation in Naperville, Ill., a company that adapts computer equipment for disabled people and expects revenues of $1 million this year, recalls how he would knock on people's doors when he was in middle school, asking if they had any household appliances to repair. At 12, he started Donny's Appliance Service in his basement. "Until about 10 years ago, I still got mail regularly delivered to Donny's Appliance," said Mr. Dalton, who is now 55.
Not every successful business owner can boast of such an early flair for salesmanship. But even those who drifted or were pushed into entrepreneurial careers seem to have a natural bent for seizing opportunities that make competitors wonder why on earth they didn't think of that themselves.
Is that what defines them? They are an eclectic lot who operate ventures that vary from grocery stores to Internet start-ups. Donald J. Jonovic, a consultant in Cleveland who has advised family businesses, says he never fails to be astonished by the "raw diversity" of American entrepreneurs.
"You look at some of them and you ask, 'My God, how'd that happen?' " he said.
In a country that prides itself on individualism and counts literally millions of entrepreneurs, it is a question worth asking. Small businesses, roughly defined as ventures controlled by their founders and having fewer than 100,000 employees, are an enormous force in the American economy.
But what drives their owners to strike out on their own rather than take refuge in the predictability and perks of salaried jobs?
The experts, of course, have their views. Mr. Jonovic says true entrepreneurs are marked by "tunnel-vision dedication" and supreme self-confidence. David G. Winter, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, said they are propelled by a zeal to excel at whatever they do, a trait he calls "achievement motivation."
"They have this optimism, this exuberance, this boldness," Mr. Winter said, which can take the form of restlessness, especially if their business grows into a larger, bureaucratic organization they can't control. If that happens, he said, "they may be so unable to deal with it that they get dismissed by their board. Or they may quit and start all over again."
He also said entrepreneurs often display a streak of authoritarianism because they believe their method is the only way to do things. "Doing their best is what matters most to them, as opposed to a concern with friendship or power," Mr. Winter said.
Entrepreneurs, he added, tend to come from middle-class backgrounds, not blue-collar homes or wealthy families, "which still view small business as a step downward into vulgar trade."
Mr. Jonovic said that many entrepreneurs are tightfisted, not out of greed but because each dollar they earn represents a small fraction of success. "I knew a successful entrepreneur who ended up in a nursing home and wouldn't pay for a private room because he wanted to keep his estate above $1 million," Mr. Jonovic said.
Entrepreneurs themselves cite a long list of self-defining characteristics and attributes: decisiveness, resilience, focus, a love of battle, a penchant for risk-taking, workaholism, good social skills.
But as they recount their histories, two core themes leap out, flip sides of the same coin: they want to be their own boss and, like the preadolescent Messrs. Blue, Gupta and Dalton, they show an uncanny knack for detecting opportunities that others missed.
Mr. Blue, the Proxymed chairman who is now 37, recalls how as a 16-year-old he talked the owner of a new doctors' building who was having trouble renting space into letting him set up a drugstore in the lobby. Before long, the complex was full, and his business boomed.
In his 20's, he started a chain of discount drug stores, then figured he could save 30 percent on the cost of generic drugs if he had his own generic-drug distribution company. "All it took was a wholesale license and a warehouse," Mr. Blue said.
Soon he sold the drugstores and expanded the distribution company. Then he sold the distribution company and got involved in another health-care business, which he sold. In the early 1990's, he invested in Proxymed, which operates an information network connecting doctors' offices with pharmacies, insurance companies and other industry sectors.
For most entrepreneurs, it all begins with the realization that working for somebody else just isn't a choice.
"I could have had a career at Six Flags, but I saw the light," said Keith M. Alper, a 36-year-old co-founder and the president of the Creative Producers Group, a St. Louis company that produces videos and special events for corporations.
Mr. Alper was named entertainment director for the Six Flags amusement park in St. Louis right out of college. He and a colleague soon put together a sideline by doing jobs for small organizations on tight budgets, including a fund-raising film for the St. Louis Zoo and an employee-motivation show for a hospital.
When Six Flags laid him off briefly, it struck Mr. Alper that as an employee "ultimately, you can't control the situation, no matter how hard you work.
"A magic light went off," he said. "I would go off on my own and succeed or fail on my own merits."
Today, Creative Producers Group, born in 1985, has revenues of about $10 million a year. Last fall, Mr. Alper opened an ad agency that writes brochures, designs corporate logos and Web sites and markets products for small businesses.
The decision to go it alone can be liberating, but it can also be scary because it means cutting off the corporate safety net. Eric B. Segal, the president of the Kenzer Corporation, an executive-recruiting firm in New York, recalls the near-panic he and his partner, Robert D. Kenzer, felt in the early days of running their company in the 70's.
Mr. Segal had been a corporate executive in the retail industry, but quit a high-paying job after he got what he viewed as an insufficient raise. As he and Mr. Kenzer scrambled to find clients, he said, he kept thinking: Where's the check? Where's Mommy?
"There are rules you learn from working in big business, but nobody's prepared for flying without the net until you do it," said Mr. Segal, who is 55. "It's frightening. I see a lot of corporate guys who can't make the conversion."
But many entrepreneurs insist that the absence of security is a small price to pay for the freedom to operate at their own pace and on their own scale. Sue Yellin, a small-business consultant who works out of her Manhattan apartment, says she is determined to remain a one-person show earning just enough money to live comfortably and "feed my cat Fancy Feasts."
Even so, Ms. Yellin is quick to see business possibilities in humdrum circumstances. A telemarketing specialist who has made an instructional tape titled "Warming Up to Cold Calling," Ms. Yellin, 46, has even figured out how to turn phone pitches she receives at home to her financial advantage.
"So many of the callers are terrible at selling," she said. "That gives me an opportunity to call their bosses and say, 'You should book me for some training.' "

HEADLINE: Fed by the Hand That Bites

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER 

 BODY:
FIFTY years ago, Lou Witzeman watched as a neighbor's house in an unincorporated area of Phoenix burned to the ground. A reporter at the time, Mr. Witzeman wrote the story for The Arizona Times, but he found a personal angle. He discovered that he, too, had no fire protection.
After unsuccessful attempts to find a municipal fire company that could provide service, "I realized I had to do it myself or forget it," he said. While continuing to work as a reporter, he formed a one-engine, four-person fire department that sold subscriptions for service to his neighbors. 
 In 1969, his company, Rural-Metro Corporation, began operating an ambulance service separate from the fire company. The service has grown into a company with annual revenues of $476 million and has shifted its focus to developing public-private partnerships.
In recent years, many more entrepreneurs are finding that the government is not simply the enemy and has more to offer than red tape. Multimillion dollar companies now do everything from operate prisons to deliver mail to American troops overseas. And small-business owners like Ben Farmer, a respiratory therapist, have taken over less weighty assignments. Mr. Farmer, for example, has been operating the paddle-boat rides for the last five years on the Downtown Canal in Indianapolis, where municipal services have been privatized extensively through competitive bidding.
"There is a whole market now of firms whose primary business is contract services for the government," said Adrian Moore, a director at the Reason Public Policy Institute, a nonprofit center in Los Angeles that focuses on privatization. "It's been around for a long time in the simplified form of janitorial services or purchasing contracts, but in the last 5 to 10 years it's gotten a lot more complex."
In many cases, what started as small entrepreneurial efforts have grown into huge corporations. The Corrections Corporation of America, started by a business executive, a lawyer and a corrections official in Tennessee, is a good model.
C.C.A., as it is known, was founded in 1983 in Nashville and got off the ground by operating a juvenile center in Memphis. It is now a business responsible for 78 prison-related ventures that encompass 63,308 beds, about 3.5 percent of the more than 1.8 million jail and prison beds in the United States.
"The private sector looks at the Federal Government as a new market," said Robert L. Raasch, the chairman of the Coalition for Taxpayer Value. "If the Federal Government looks at ways to save money, it's going to look to private sector bidders or entrepreneurs."
The coalition is spearheading the push for legislation that would result in privatization of what are considered commercial jobs in the Federal Government. The measure would push Federal agencies to decide whether to turn these commercial activities over to private companies.
Mr. Raasch said that his goal goes beyond privatization. He wants the Federal Government to stop taking business away from the private sector. As examples he used the Veterans Administration's hospitals competing for laundry contracts.
"Our official position is that anything that is not inherently governmental, like providing advice to the President or national security, should be done privately," Mr. Raasch said.
Organizations representing Federal workers, however, have opposed the measure, saying that it is based on a faulty assumption -- that making a government function private always saves money.
Opponents note that there are plenty of cases where privatization or extensive outside contracting has led to shoddy work and higher costs. In the private prison industry, cases of brutality, neglect and insufficient services have raised questions about prisons being a bottom-line business.
Companies handling government business is not new, but in recent years the relationships have become more entwined. For example, when United States troops went into Bosnia in 1995, a private Houston company did the troops' laundry, provided their meals and helped establish base camps.
The company, Brown & Root Services, won a five-year contract in 1992 to provide logistical services to forces deployed overseas because the military, after downsizing, began farming out support services. The contract has also taken the company to Somalia, Zaire and Haiti.
"They've done mail delivery, run shuttle services, provided potable water and taken care of solid waste," said Joan Kibler, the public-affairs officer for the Trans-Atlantic Program Center of the Army Corps of Engineers, which ran the service.
Representatives of small businesses complain that the the opportunities for them are more limited. "Larger businesses are more likely to do government contracting," said Dan Danner, a vice president of Federal Government relations with the National Federation of Independent Business. For what he called the "smallest of the small," local and Federal governments are still more of a problem -- think regulations and taxes -- than a benefit.
But Mr. Witzeman, who has retired but remains on the board of Rural-Metro, says that he still sees plenty of room for entrepreneurs to explore business relationships with all government levels.
"I didn't expect it to be this at the beginning," he said, considering how his company has grown into a major corporation by working with local governments. "But as I saw the trend developing I got less and less surprised. I wish I could be here 50 years from now to see where it's going. I think we'll have a very happy and cost-effective existence."

HEADLINE: Ingredients for Success: Ground Pigments and Linseed Oil

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SOLOMON; Deborah Solomon's most recent book, "Utopia Parkway: The Life and Work of Joseph Cornell," has just been issued in paperback.

 BODY:
CARL PLANSKY holds the strange distinction of being a prospering entrepreneur who has yet to acquire a tie or a jacket. He owns Williamsburg Art Supplies, a tiny shop on the Lower East Side of Manhattan that specializes in homemade oil paints. In an age when most paint is mass-produced, and when even much of the art in the galleries has a manufactured sheen (think video monitors), Mr. Plansky has earned a loyal following for his Old Worldish ways. "I don't want to boast," he said on a recent afternoon, "but all the schmeary painters buy from me."
At 47, Mr. Plansky is a short, rotund man with flyaway gray hair. Dressed in a plaid shirt, the tails hanging out over rumpled work pants, he looks like an artist, and in fact is one. Unable to live off the sale of his art, he went into the paint business in 1986. The idea of an artist grinding his own pigments may evoke quaint visions of Ye Olde Paint Shoppe, yet in New York, where the number of artists (roughly 100,000) well exceeds the entire population of Florence during the Renaissance, the competition among art-supply companies is fierce. 
 Last year, Mr. Plansky sold 21,000 tubes of oil paint, not quite as many as, say, Winsor & Newton, a London-based company that sold 2 million tubes in North America alone. Nonetheless, Mr. Plansky is thrilled to claim an income in the mid-five figures. "It's like having a perpetual, never-ending grant," he exclaimed.
His storefront on East Fourth Street is picturesque, a tiny, sun-flooded space stocked with a bright array of supplies -- jars of powdered pigment, quart-size bottles of linseed oil, tubes of oil paint in colors that span the rainbow. On a typical day, his customers might range from art students with spiked hair and pierced noses to leading painters like Milton Resnick, Bill Jensen, Terry Winters and Brice Marden. "I have a special relationship with Carl's colors," Mr. Marden noted with affection, referring to the company's wide selection of one-of-a-kind hues, which include Spanish Earth, Intense Black and Courbet Green.
Mr. Plansky describes his entry into the paint business as a kind of happy accident. In 1985, working from his studio in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, he began making oil paint for himself. Although he had no plans to sell it, within a year his artist-friends had mooched, bartered and bought enough paint from him to turn him into the master supplier of the Williamsburg art crowd. Mr. Plansky wasn't sure whether that meant he was a bona fide success or just a potential tax evader, and he promptly contacted the Internal Revenue Service.
"I was making too much money to pretend that my activities were like Grandma's cookies at the flea market," he recalled. "There were too many checks, so I had to go legit and get a tax number for resale."
To be sure, the stereotypical artist is thought to be hopeless at numbers, and Mr. Plansky says it's true. His company is now a bustling operation with five employees and a hilltop factory outside Oneonta, N.Y., yet he tries to stay removed from the nuts and bolts. He relies on an accountant to take care of what he calls "all that payroll stuff." An office manager keeps track of sales. The company has never advertised or taken out a loan. While other executives plot expansionist dramas, Mr. Plansky routinely declines offers from retail outlets eager to sell his products. "If I made the paint any faster," he explained, "the quality wouldn't be the same."
Most oil paint is made from a mixture of ground pigments and linseed oil, but that basic recipe, like any recipe, is only as good as the person using it. While big paint companies generally grind every last ounce of pigment and oil to a uniform consistency, Mr. Plansky, using a three-roll mill designed in the 19th century, grinds each of his 120 colors to a consistency of its own. Artists who are Minimal, Conceptual or just overly literal are not likely to love Mr. Plansky's paint. Rather, it appeals to those who revel in the muckiness of oil paint.
"Carl makes the best paint around," said Bill Jensen, a 53-year-old painter of darkly churning abstractions. "With commercial paints, everything comes out feeling like molasses. But with Carl's paint, every color has a different texture. His raw umber is unbelievable. It feels like sand."
Naturally, Mr. Plansky's corporate competitors are less impressed with his home-brewed paint. "It's just about elitism," said Lynn Pearl, a spokeswoman for Winsor & Newton, the long-established seller of artists' oil paints. "Artists like having a secret source. They like to think they're using a paint that there are only five tubes of. But we believe that commercial paints are superior because of the fineness of the pigment particles."
Debates about oil paint are as old as oil paint itself, which was invented at the dawn of the Renaissance. All the Old Masters ground their own pigments, while famously refusing to share their recipes. The exact ingredients of any artist's paint was considered a matter of utmost secrecy, giving rise to suspicion, furious gossip and scholarly treatises. "If you go to the British Museum," Mr. Plansky noted, "you could no doubt find beneath a pile of 20,000 books a treatise titled, 'How I Think Rubens Probably Made His Famous Glazes to Get That Enamel-Like Quality in His Nudes.' "
A turning point came in the mid-19th century, with the invention of the squeeze tube. Artists had previously stored their paints in pig bladders, which were prized for being airtight; tubed paints offered a new convenience. They brought on the phenomenon of the Sunday painter, and the biggest shake-up in art history since the Renaissance. As Mr. Plansky explained, offering a view of French Impressionism not likely to be heard in an art-history class: "Suddenly artists had portable materials. They could go outdoors and paint plein-air and not have to worry about puncturing some bladder."
The son of a hairdresser ("My father specialized in big hair for weddings and bar mitzvahs," he said), Mr. Plansky grew up in Baltimore. At 18, he moved to New York, eager to prove himself in the art capital, or rather to suffer the grand indignities of the creative life. After a stint at the New York Studio School, he worked at odd jobs, spending about a decade behind the counters of delicatessens in Greenwich Village. "I was the best lox slicer in New York," he said.
OVER the years, Mr. Plansky has received intermittent encouragement for his own artwork -- big, voluptuous landscapes that focus mostly on trees. When he had his first solo show, at the 55 Mercer gallery in SoHo in 1992, the critic Jed Perl noted in The New Criterion: "I can't think of another artist of Plansky's generation who has such a splendiferous feeling for paint. . . . Plansky is a natural."
These days, however, Mr. Plansky can't find a gallery willing to exhibit his work. He regularly wanders SoHo and Chelsea with slides of his more recent paintings, humbly asking dealers to take a look. "The cult of youth makes it hard to get a show," he said with resignation. "Everyone wants the latest thing, but the latest thing is retro or neo-retro. I don't get it."
In the meantime, Mr. Plansky is glad to be earning a living in the paint business, even if surveys indicate that the demand for oil paint is no longer growing. Since the 50's, when Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning splashed out their Abstract Expressionist masterpieces and invested oil paint with a new grandeur, rival paints have come along. The 60's saw a boom in acrylic paints, which are made from a liquid form of plastic and allow artists to wash their brushes in water, as opposed to smelly turpentine. Acrylics were the perfect complement to the no-muss, no-fuss look of Warhol's soup cans and the Pop productions of their era.
Nowadays, the latest vogue is for "water-based oil paint," a contradiction of terms that is proving to be a commercial success. "It's really insane," Mr. Plansky observed. "How can someone choose a paint just because it's easy to clean up?"
It's true that oil-on-canvas loyalists can sometimes seem like an embattled minority. Yet Mr. Plansky has played no small part in keeping them alive, or at least well stocked with supplies. His paints are competitively priced, from $7 for a standard studio-size tube of burnt umber to $30 for cobalt yellow. Special customers receive a 30 percent discount but, as Mr. Plansky said, "Everyone is a special customer."

HEADLINE: SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS: LESSON 1;
Safer in the Rapids Than by the Shore

BYLINE: By BRIAN ALEXANDER 

 BODY:
AS a teen-ager, Bill Kimpton was fired from the Clift Hotel in San Francisco. Later, he was rejected for admission to Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration. But in 1981 Mr. Kimpton finally became a hotelier when he left investment banking and took over the Hotel Bedford, a rundown tourist flop on Union Square in San Francisco.
He renovated the building, but then the recession in the early 80's left the beds empty. On the verge of bankruptcy, Mr. Kimpton began to push the Bedford's relatively low rates to some potential corporate accounts that normally used chain hotels. The tactic worked, and the Hotel Bedford was saved. 
 Seventeen years later, Mr. Kimpton, now 63, has built a string of 22 European-style hotels in the United States owned or managed by the Kimpton Group. Most of the hotels are anchored by well-regarded restaurants.
The formula is successful. In 1988, the Kimpton Group had revenues of $34 million. This year, it expects $300 million, its occupancy rates consistently ranking at or near the top of the industry.
"Life is a big river, and if you can relax and sit in the middle of it with some energy, you will enjoy the adventure and make it through any rapids," Mr. Kimpton said. "If you sit still and hold onto the side of the bank, you will get beaten up by the river."
He continued: "This concept for the hotels came together when I was in London, staying at a little hotel called the Wilbraham. I think a room was $35, but it was so friendly, the fabrics so warm, I said, Wow, I like this and I am paying 10 percent of what I just paid at the Intercontinental.
"It was a tiny room, a small bed, but the people were so friendly, the bartender called me by name, the room clerk said hello. I said to myself, This feels like home.
"The key is to maintain integrity and honesty because if you are honest with yourself and honest with everybody around you, they will give you second, third, fourth chances. If you fake it, you'll wonder why it didn't work."
The moral of the story? "Trust your intuition and let go of the fear," Mr. Kimpton said.

HEADLINE: Students at B-Schools Flock to the E-Courses

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill.

 BODY:
AS the sun begins its pink descent behind the neo-Gothic spire of Deering Library, two barefoot students lazily toss a Frisbee across a great expanse of lawn. Backpack-toting undergraduates saunter by. Four flights up, in Northwestern University's Leverone Hall, 18 students and a professor are gathered around a classroom table dotted with water bottles and cups of iced coffee. Pens are filling notebooks.
It is a classic academic scene, but the talk this July evening is not of Dante or of the pre-Socratics. It is of angel investors, price-earnings ratios and what it means to work for a company so young that its founders still have no desks or no telephone lines. The students, led by Steven Rogers, a clinical professor of management, are spending their summer working for start-up companies in the area in what may turn into full-time jobs. All the students are in the master's program of Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, one of scores of business schools that over the last five years have built programs and majors in entrepreneurship studies, an arresting mix of the plainly pragmatic and the utterly ephemeral. 
 Driven by student and alumni demand, no field is hotter today in business studies than that of entrepreneurship. Whereas a generation ago the goal of top M.B.A. graduates was to join a Fortune 500 company and climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent desire nowadays seems to be to come up with a marketable idea, start a company and work for themselves.
"This is like the end of the 19th century when Rockefeller and Carnegie were the icons," said Steven N. Kaplan, a professor at the University of Chicago who teaches entrepreneurial finance. "Today it is Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. So much of what will dominate the landscape in 50 years is starting now."
According to Murray Low, who directs entrepreneurship studies at Columbia University, scholarship in the field is exploding. In the mid-1980's there were only a few scholarly journals devoted to new businesses; today there are 26, most of them started in the last five years. In 1980, there were 18 entrepreneurship chairs at business schools; today there are more than 200.
Jerome Katz of St. Louis University, who has been tracking this growth, says that in a 1991 study of the approximately 300 accredited business schools in the country, a couple of dozen were found to offer some course work in entrepreneurship. Today, about 120 of them offer it as a major.
While defining entrepreneurship studies remains problematic, scholars in the field agree that its sudden popularity has several roots. First, the corporate downsizing of the 80's changed the view that a good corporate job meant long-term security. Second, technology and globalization have changed the way the world does business. A product's shelf life has been greatly reduced, and challenges from remote places mean that companies need flexibility, which is a challenge for large, formal hierarchies of traditional corporations.
Finally, scholars say, young people have grown up in an environment that emphasizes independence and self-reliance.
Jon A. Levey, a student in the Northwestern group, epitomizes the new spirit. Having secured a good job at a regional bank straight out of college seven years ago, Mr. Levey left last year to get a master's in management and recently joined Firefly Greetings, which sells custom business and personal cards and gifts over the Internet. With its six employees, the entire company could fit into this classroom. Mr. Levey said he couldn't be happier about the switch.
"I spent several years in corporate America and it wasn't for me," he said. "I couldn't stand getting a paycheck signed by someone else."
His fellow students around the table expressed similar sentiments -- the thrill of taking a risk, building something from scratch, sharing in the next industrial revolution that computers seem to be generating. The question for business schools is: How do you teach all that?
"Entrepreneurship is really about the three P's: pride, passion and perseverance," said A. Barry Merkin, a clinical professor of entrepreneurship at Kellogg. "It's about risk-taking, boldness and confidence."
The best analogy, Mr. Merkin noted, is to sports. "Intuitive qualities are essential, but few can reach real heights without coaching," he said. "There are basic things to learn, like accounting and finance, but also narrower areas like writing a business plan, raising capital. I also try to give my students a feeling of what it is like to go through something like this, the tensions and frustrations, because folks who go into this without realizing what they are doing will face nervous breakdowns, heart attacks and divorce."
These are not matters, either the business plans or the heart attacks, most academics with Ph.D.'s want to teach or to study. There is a lack of reliable data on start-up companies, and without data it is hard to produce rigorous scholarship, the grist of academic careers. This has created a split, because alumni are donating truckloads of dollars to set up centers and chairs in entrepreneurship, yet there are no scholars to fill them. Professor Katz of St. Louis University said that dozens of the entrepreneurship chairs remained empty.
New York University is a good example. Its Stern School of Business has four endowed chairs of entrepreneurship, two unfilled.
"I see entrepreneurship as a word in search of a meaning in the academic sense," said George Daly, Stern's dean. "Academics sort themselves into these little silos, and entrepreneurship is not easily matched for them. But the role being played by small, innovative enterprises in our society is phenomenal and should be studied. The challenge is to persuade academics to look beyond their own boundaries."
Mr. Daly added: "By nature, of course, academics are not very entrepreneurial. Like a number of business-school deans, I find myself fighting the prevailing winds."
Business schools are increasingly turning to practitioners rather than scholars to teach entrepreneurship, either alone or paired with a more traditional professor. That is why Mr. Merkin of Kellogg is called a "clinical professor," on the model of medical school professors who are M.D.'s rather than Ph.D.'s. This, too, has caused tension.
"Generally speaking, tenured professors consider businessmen without Ph.D's to be lower-life forms," said Kenneth P. Morse, the founder of high-tech ventures and managing director of the Entrepreneurship Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management. "But there were 1 million start-ups in the world last year, and anyone who wants to be involved in such a start-up has a lot to learn -- how to pick the funding, how to give a raise, how not to run out of money. This is different from what used to be taught. General Motors is never going to run out of money."
Y OUNG scholars are beginning to take the plunge. One is Professor Kaplan, who is interested in the evolution of corporate governance since the wave of mergers and acquisitions of the 80's reshaped many companies. His course on entrepreneurial finance is one of the most sought after at the University of Chicago.
Another scholar bringing respectability to the field is Paul A. Gompers, an associate professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. Professor Gompers acknowledges the difficulty in gathering data but says the field is too exciting to allow that to be a barrier.
"I get data from private consulting firms or through large pension funds or endowments that provide access to their files," Professor Gompers said. "A lot of it is hand-collected. I'm putting together data on 1,300 firms, collecting a complete financial history, their boards of directors, scales of compensation to study how they operate and grow. I have hired 10 to 15 research assistants during the course of this project over the last two and a half years."
Meanwhile, much of what goes on at entrepreneurship centers today consists of students going through the motions of setting up new ventures, and sometimes actually doing the ventures. Business school has turned into a kind of laboratory. Business-plan competitions, both local and national, have grown rapidly in scale with students presenting their plans to venture capitalists and competing for donated prize money to help them set up companies.
One such winner was Evan Schumacher, a 29-year-old native of Boston who finished at Northwestern this spring. His plan called for setting up a software company that tracks global shipping, freight and customs management for international firms. Mr. Schumacher won the Kellogg competition and took his plan to Austin, Tex., in May for national finals. He was a finalist, and as he walked off the stage after his presentation, his wireless microphone still clipped to his lapel, a man in the audience approached him and asked how much he needed.
The man became the company's first angel investor, in for $250,000. The company, Celarix, was born at the end of June in Chicago. So far, it has raised $500,000 from investors and is planning to raise another $1 million to $2 million from venture- capital firms. A third employee will join the company this month.
 
For Teen-Agers, Too, There Are Programs to Get Started
 COLLEGE isn't the only place where students can study entrepreneurship. In a 1994 Gallup poll, 7 out of 10 American high-school students said they wanted to start their own business. Some are young dreamers who have always believed they would chart their own course. Others have seen parents or relatives lose jobs through downsizing and want to avoid the same fate.
There are programs that teach the fundamentals of starting a business, often through practical experience, to young people and their teachers.

HEADLINE: His Dream Is That We'll All Hear Little Voices

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

DATELINE: WAYNE, N.J.

 BODY:
DRIVE west from Manhattan, through the Lincoln Tunnel and into the thick of one of the many commercial bloodstreams that feeds the suburban beast engulfing New York City. Go about 20 miles from the Hudson River, past the Tick Tock Diner and the all-night A&P, to a nondescript office building that overlooks a 14-theater multiplex and a warehouse-size Costco.
That is where you'll find, on the third floor, a modest little company called Audible Inc., which just happens to have outsize ambitions. 
 It's an unlikely location, certainly, for a three-year-old Internet start-up, one that hopes to create a big audience for something completely different: custom audio information delivered on demand over the Web to portable devices you can listen to any time and anywhere while jogging, say, or driving to work.
Then again, the guy who founded the company, Donald Katz, is a rather unlikely entrepreneur.
"You're a journalist!" a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers exclaimed when Mr. Katz went to its Silicon Valley offices more than two years ago to ask for venture capital. "What makes you think you can start a business?"
Good question. And in the answer lies not just the reason some of the smartest investors in the United States, including Kleiner Perkins and Patricof & Company, have anted up about $18 million on the entrepreneurial dream of Mr. Katz, who is 46 and the author of three highly acclaimed nonfiction books. It also offers a clue as to why so many of the best and the brightest of a generation that once disdained business, particularly the idea of starting a small business, now embrace it.
"When we were growing up, business was grubby, something our fathers did," said Fred Smoler, a professor of literature at Sarah Lawrence College who has known Mr. Katz for more than 25 years. "The ideal was to become an artist, a writer, involved in politics, something like that."
That is no longer true. Today, starting a business strikes many people, particularly younger people, as a worthy goal -- something valuable beyond simply the money it might bring.
A recent study by the Wells Fargo Bank and the National Federation of Independent Businesses' Education Foundation found that of the record 5.6 million Americans who started their own businesses in 1996, about half were under the age of 36. Most of their businesses were tiny, home-based operations, of course, but "instead of marching to the beat of corporate drums," said William J. Dennis, the author of the study, many more young people "prefer to build or buy their own drum, allowing them to pound out their own beat."
Mr. Katz never marched to anyone's beat but his own. In starting Audible, he drew on his own experiences as a writer combined with the thirst to create something new from the seemingly limitless potential of the Internet. "Audible seeks to wed the oldest of human technologies, the spoken word, with the newest of technologies," he said with characteristic ardor. "We want to be a leader in teaching the Internet to talk."
Translating that vision into a successful business will not be easy. Like just about every other Internet venture these days, including several that have gone public and quickly been bid into billion-dollar market valuations, Audible, still private, is losing plenty of money.
The company has about 35 employees, its own portable player and a Web site (www.audible.com) where users can immediately download from a selection of 16,000 hours of copyrighted audio files containing everything from traditional read-aloud books like Frank McCourt's "Angela's Ashes" ($9) to bundles of advice from the Harvard Business Review ($3 to $13) and such. For all its success in building a new infrastructure, however, the company is just beginning to attract paying customers.
Mr. Katz is accustomed to taking risks. For two decades, from the time he left the London School of Economics in 1975 to write, on spec, an article for Rolling Stone magazine on the Basque separatist movement, Mr. Katz was a freelance journalist. Early on, he penetrated the bomb-throwing Red Brigade in Italy and survived a dangerous visit to Ethiopia during a civil war. But he never romanticized the revolutionaries and terrorists he covered.
In the early 80's, Mr. Katz turned his attention to a world that seemed even more of a mystery: money and business. Originally from Chicago, he decided to write a book about Sears, Roebuck & Company, his hometown giant. Sears, the once-great store of the American middle class and one of the most secretive corporations in the country, was in the midst of an immense crisis. Mr. Katz persuaded Edward Telling, its chief executive, to give him carte blanche access to the company.
"You must be a hell of a salesman," Sears' top public-relations executive, who had opposed the move, told Mr. Katz. The book, "The Big Store," took six years to research and write.
Mr. Katz followed with two other books that also required him to open closed doors, one a look at the post-World War middle-class experience told through a single extended family that revealed its most intimate secrets, and the other an inside look at Nike and its reclusive chairman, Phil Knight. In business, surprisingly, Mr. Katz did find a subject worthy of epic treatment. And he discovered he had a taste for it.
WITH Ed Lau, his college roommate who moved into the computer industry, Mr. Katz began to develop an idea for a business that would deliver radio programs and audio books through the Internet. His next book project, on the convergence of digital technologies, was dropped.
"It was something I couldn't write into reality," Mr. Katz said. "I had to do it."
Not all of Mr. Katz's old habits were perfectly adaptable to his new entrepreneurial world.
"His first business plan was 160 pages long, and there were no numbers in it," Andrew J. Huffman, an experienced computer-industry executive who recently became Audible's president and chief executive officer, said with a laugh and only a touch of exaggeration. "Everybody else does maybe 10 to 20 pages."
But many of his skills did prove useful. He found a fresh outlet for the powers of persuasion that had opened so many doors in his writing career. The first big convert was Tim Mott, now a wealthy private investor in Ketchum, Idaho, who is renowned in Silicon Valley as a co-founder of Electronic Arts, the computer-game maker, and Macromedia, a software company specializing in multimedia graphic-design applications.
"I get calls all the time about start-up ideas, and I probably look at at least one business plan a week," Mr. Mott said. "Over the course of five years, I've seen, maybe, four that I wanted to commit money and time. This was one of them."
With Mr. Mott as chairman, they made the round of venture-capital firms. "Tim's business experience and Don's visionary ideas were a powerful combination," said Kevin Compton, a partner at Kleiner Perkins who became their chief backer there. "Three minutes into conversation you could just feel Don's passion."
Audible stands out in the crowded Internet bazaar in a few important ways. For one, it is not simply an on-line store like amazon.com, which relies on traditional package services to deliver books and CD's at a discount. Nor is it one of the myriad media Web sites that are counting on advertising to pay the freight.
Rather, Audible is built around the premise that lots of people are willing to pay regularly to fill their time -- on the go -- with constantly changing audio packages of entertainment, news and practical advice. Audio books are already a $1.6 billion business, and Audible can offer essentially the same thing at a lower price. Even more promising is the potential for pumping millions of mobile workers full of management information, corporate training and "time-shifted" business news while traveling.
To make all that possible, Audible had to design its own portable player. It is roughly the size and shape of an electric razor, holds two hours of audio and plugs into a personal computer through a cradle similar to one used in hand-held computers. People can carry the battery-powered gadget anywhere, listen to it through headphones or play clips in a car stereo system. Programs are stored on a computer, ready to refill the player as soon as it is returned to its cradle, which remains attached to the computer.
FOR the moment, though, the player is also an Achilles heel. It is relatively expensive, costing $200 as a stand-alone purchase. Two hours is not enough storage time, particularly since lots of audio books run three to four hours. And it is not easy for the technologically challenged to use.
To overcome these drawbacks, Audible is developing a second-generation player with greater abilities and is exploring new pricing plans similar to those used to sell mobile-phone services, in which buyers would receive the player at a steep reduction if they sign up for a subscription.
Relying mostly on word of mouth, Audible says it has attracted more than 5,000 customers and shipped about 3,000 players. Those using the player spend an average of about $20 a month on fresh content.
But Audible's real ace in the hole is not the player but the rights it has painstakingly sewn up with dozens of content providers. It is planning to introduce new programs -- from an audio digest of The Wall Street Journal to National Public Radio's "Fresh Air" program -- that will be sent automatically to a subscriber's computer. And it will adapt all Audible products so that they can be played on a variety of portable devices, beginning with the hand-held organizers powered by Microsoft's Windows CE software.
Even before the recent stock-market turmoil, Audible's outside investors, who own about 56 percent of the company (the founders and employees own the rest) remained cautious about going public, insisting they do not intend to sell stock until the company is generating a growing and predictable revenue stream.
Which is a good thing, given the uncertainty about even the most promising Internet ventures.
"There's no in-between," said Paul Hawken, the author of "Growing a Business" and an entrepreneur who co-founded Smith & Hawken, the mail-order garden-supply and clothing company. "Either Audible will be wallpaper, or it will be a billion-dollar-pus company."

HEADLINE: Big in Small Business, Straining to Grow

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

 BODY:
THERE is an old joke told by statistics professors about a fellow who has his feet in the oven and his head in the freezer: on average, he feels fine.
The lesson is that statistics can be wildly misleading if they are not put into perspective. It's a point that is often lost in the popular notion that female entrepreneurship is a robust and increasingly significant segment of the American economy. 
 It is true that more and more women are starting, or running, their own businesses. Women now own nearly 40 percent of the 23 million businesses in the United States. Female-owned businesses employ more than 18 million people, generate more than $2 trillion in sales annually and have obtained more bank loans than ever before. And the growth of employment by female-owned businesses is greater than the national average in nearly every region of the country and in nearly every major industry.
So these should be heady times for women. But another, gloomier statistic may be more significant than the rest: women get less than 2 percent of the venture capital invested each year in American businesses. And it is venture capital, more than anything, that moves an entrepreneurial endeavor from the spare bedroom and into the big, or even medium, leagues.
"There's just no equity funding available for women-owned businesses," said Jere W. Glover, the chief counsel for advocacy at the Small Business Administration.
The reason is simple, he said: "Most venture-capital funds are run by white men. And most venture capitalists will tell you that the majority of their deals come from people they've known in the past."
Investing venture capital can be risky. It is essentially betting on someone else's expertise and ability, so knowing the entrepreneur is a definite advantage. It is also a world centered on country clubs and sky boxes, to which comparatively few women have access.
"It's an old-boys network," said Sherrye Henry, an assistant administrator of the office of women's business ownership at the S.B.A. "They get on their planes and go to golf games. We're really trying to find ways to get around that cultural pattern of lending in this country."
It is still possible to borrow money from banks, and women have made significant progress there. Over the last seven years, bank loans to women and insured by the S.B.A. have tripled in number and increased in dollar value by 164 percent. That's about 48,000 loans worth about $7 billion. Some banks, like Wells Fargo, even have special lending programs for businesswomen.
The problem with bank loans, however, is that an informal but nearly impenetrable limit of about $100,000 exists. It is what some people call "the other glass ceiling."
Most small-business owners with solid credit ratings can borrow $100,000 with little difficulty, Mr. Glover said. "You can probably borrow that much money just with credit cards," he added.
"But over $100,000, the debt-to-equity ratio that banks insist on hits you very quickly," he said. "In a very fast-changing economy, like information and technology, you either grow or perish."
By contrast, the median amount of the typical venture-capital deal is $6 million to $7 million. And though some eight million female-owned businesses exist, most are small. In fact, only 15 percent have employees.
Even those who succeed in landing venture capital have lots to say about the obstacles women face. Susan Williams DeFife of McLean, Va., has made the leap from one-woman home office to a thriving enterprise with 16 employees in an office building nearby.
Now 37 years old, Ms. DeFife was working for an organization called Women Executives in State Government in the early 1990's when she decided to become an entrepreneur. After several years looking for the right enterprise, she settled with on-line services in 1994. They were used very little by businesswomen then, she said, because there was little relevant information. The women also felt that on-line discussion groups, often dominated by men, were condescending.
Ms. DeFife and three male friends who had taken buyouts from I.B.M. then started Women's Connection Online (womenconnect.com), a job-and-information service for women. The men moved on, leaving Ms. DeFife to manage the struggling company on her own. "I was making a decent part-time living working 60 hours a week out of my home," she recalled.
Then came one of the most important ingredients in producing a successful business: luck. At an annual dinner of the Northern Virginia Technology Council, Ms. DeFife sat next to a venture capitalist. Later, she and a man she had brought into the business for his computer expertise, met with the investor, whom she declined to identify.
It was a meeting full of tough questions and heavy analysis, summed up with a statement she knew was true. "He said, 'Your biggest problem is going to be being taken seriously.' And he told me I was smart to have a man involved. I didn't get angry; I'm not sure why."
EVENTUALLY, the investor became her mentor, guiding her through dozens of unsuccessful attempts to raise money. With each pitch she found herself more self-confident and aware of what impressed investors and what didn't.
"I talked a lot about the mission of the company, but they wanted to hear about how they would make money," she said. "I can hold my own now.You can't be afraid to hear 'No.' "
Ultimately, she raised $500,000 from a venture-capital fund and another $130,000 from individual investors, including her mentor. Earlier this year, she got another $1.5 million from venture-capital funds, based on the business's good health.
As an alternative to the old venture-capital system, the S.B.A. has organized the Angel Capital Electronic Network on the Internet, at www.sba.gov/advo, and has won approval from 28 states to allow companies to register and seek investors. Using the network lets companies avoid the cumbersome and expensive process of registering state by state. The project, which is just getting off the ground, has produced few results so far.
So the portrait of female entrepreneurs may show encouraging signs of growth, but high hurdles remain. More than 80 percent of the businesses are in traditionally female areas: 52 percent are service businesses; 19 percent are retail, and 10 percent are finance, insurance or real estate. And nearly three-fourths of the female-owned firms operating in 1991 were still in business three years later, compared with two-thirds of all American firms, according to an S.B.A. survey.
As Ms. Henry sees it, there has been important progress since the time when, not so long ago, "some of the best ideas for women died in bank parking lots."
The Clinton Administration, Ms. Henry said, has made a priority of increasing the number of female-owned businesses. And after Congressional hearings in 1994, when many women complained about getting short shrift from banks, a program to help women prepare loan applications began.
"Many had service businesses that don't have widgets on the shelves that banks like to take over," Ms. Henry said. To compensate for the lack of traditional collateral, she added, "we take women to intermediaries who shine those bank packages up to a fare-thee-well."
And there is tremendous growth, at least by percentage, for women in nontraditional businesses, like construction companies and computer services, she said. "Women are into everything," Ms. Henry said. "And women have done this in the face of big cultural barriers."

HEADLINE: It's Her Label and She'll Sign Who She Wants To

BYLINE: By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
WHEN Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was told he shouldn't be singing at all.
"I wasn't happy," Ms. Richards said. "I was making money, but I couldn't talk to anyone about the great show I saw last night or the great record I found. It was a job." 
 So in 1992, she started her own company: Thrill Jockey Records, named after a gang of delinquents in a B movie. It would release music she cared about and let the musicians decide what to release, how to package it and how to run their careers. "I wanted a company where the artists' expectations and the labels' abilities were in line," she said. "I don't think major labels are inherently evil or out to destroy the world. I just don't happen to use music that fits their system."
That music, Ms. Richards said, is simply "what I like." Thrill Jockey is a leading outlet for what some critics have named "post-rock": instrumentals that elude categorization as jazz, pop tunes or dance music. The label's best-selling band is Tortoise, whose most recent album has sold nearly 100,000 copies worldwide.
But Thrill Jockey has also released albums by the neo-Appalachian duo Freakwater, two women who sing about hard times; the electronic group Oval, which has built compositions on the sounds of skipping CD's, and the Nerve, a peppy alternative-rock band.
"It's kind of freaky, left-of-center stuff that she puts out, but at the same time there's a big enough audience so that she can make a living," said Nic Harcourt, the creative music director of KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, Calif., and the host of the station's "Morning Becomes Eclectic," a program that the music business on the West Coast follows closely.
In six years, Thrill Jockey has released 60 albums (both as CD's and old-fashioned vinyl LP's), singles and EP's. All but three releases have broken even or turned a profit. By contrast, 80 percent to 90 percent of albums from major labels post losses. But Thrill Jockey works on a grass-roots scale, seeking sales in thousands rather than millions; its typical release breaks even with sales of 1,500 CD's and 500 LP's. Last year, Thrill Jockey's profit was $183,000, and while that is probably less than what Columbia Records spends on catering, it is a success story in independent rock.
Until last year, Ms. Richards, who is 33 years old, did everything herself, from signing talent to lining up band interviews. Now Thrill Jockey has three other full-time employees and one part timer and is about to buy its own small building.
Ms. Richards started Thrill Jockey while working four days a week at Pier Platters, an alternative-rock record store in Hoboken, N.J. She ran the label from her third-floor walk-up apartment on Avenue C in Manhattan, carrying mail-order CD's to U.P.S. because she didn't ship enough to qualify for a pickup. Her capital was $20,000 from her grandmother, $10,000 from her father and the $5,000 from her savings account; she has never needed another infusion. Her business advisers were people who had started their own labels.
"I was constantly asking advice from people: cheaper places to press things, ways to cut corners," she said. "One thing about independently distributed record labels is that you don't get this competitive feeling. As long as you are willing to reciprocate with information, people are happy to give it."
In 1995, Ms. Richards moved from New York to Chicago, where her main manufacturer and distributor, Touch and Go, is based. Rent and taxes are considerably lower than they are in New York, she noted.
Many independent companies are stepping stones for bands that hope to be discovered by major labels. By contract, the smaller labels then share in the profits from the major-label releases. "I don't want to spend my time as a farm label," Ms. Richards said. "From a business standpoint, it would be better to have bands bound to contracts so I'd get a piece of their future. But I don't want to make money from a system I don't support."
Thrill Jockey makes unusually generous deals with musicians. Once an album breaks even, the label and the musicians each get 50 percent of the gross receipts. "When the net comes down, they actually get more than me," Ms. Richards said. Contracts are often literally a handshake.
Ms. Richards chooses bands that, she thinks, can benefit from the scale of her company and will stay. "If becoming famous is their primary focus, then we're not the right label for them," she said. "But if they want to continue to make music and live off that, then that's a goal we can achieve."
Thrill Jockey records most albums for under $3,000, one three-hundredth of what a band like U2 spends, and advertises sparingly. Video clips tend to be made by friends of the bands or as projects by art students, though they have been shown occasionally on MTV. Thrill Jockey depends largely on the unpaid promotion of college radio stations and reviews in the press, but it also uses club disk jockeys and skateboarding magazines to reach consumers.
"Each record is totally different," Ms. Richards said. "It's not as if I sold a really great new garbage can or a nice clock. Your most popular band this year could be completely unpopular next year. My company has to be flexible and adapt.
"I want my company to stay in business and do well," she said. "But the creative stuff was always the motivation that sparked it. It wasn't, I see a way to make money better. It was, I can make this artist's experience better.
"This is a lot of work," Ms. Richards added. "But it never feels like a job."

HEADLINE: Vive la Pizza: Simple, Rustic and, Yes, French

BYLINE: By MARK BITTMAN 

 BODY:
EVEN though the French influence is everywhere in New York's culinary world, a few foods that are common in France have managed to escape the city's dragnet and remain almost unknown here. The French pizza is one stunning example. Yes, pizza. Although it is most often known as a pissaladiere, it is what it is: a round, flat bread, crisp on the bottom, simply garnished on top, rustic and yet urbane.
At first, I couldn't remember seeing even one here, but recently I went searching for these French pizzas, with some success. At the restaurant Provence in SoHo, there is in fact a pissaladiere that gets it just right: a serving of leavened bread with a thin, brittle crust on the bottom and, on the top, a blanket of golden sauteed onions and a bit of anchovy. At Picholine on the Upper West Side, a similar but smaller pissaladiere is sometimes offered as an appetizer. Another kind of French pizza, the tarte flambee of Alsace, usually served with bacon, chopped onion and a touch of the creamy cheese called fromage blanc, is a study in achieving complex flavors and textures with the minimum number of ingredients. Mercer Kitchen in SoHo serves one version. 
 Beyond these, the offerings are sparse, indeed. But travel through the regions of France with your eyes open for anything that looks like pizza, and you'll come back impressed not only by how plentiful these pizzas are but also by their variety. Some, like the galette de Perouges, are sweet rather than savory. And many of them are served at room temperature.
In fact the pizzas of France and Italy, despite having different tendencies in herbs and cheese, have more in common with each other than they do with most of those produced here. Most American pizzas appeal to the national tendency toward excess, and they have been corrupted into serving as a complete meal -- a weighty concoction consisting of a ton of chewy mozzarella and a host of strong-flavored ingredients loaded onto a crust that, whether thick or thin, can barely support its toppings.
In Italy, most pizzas are exactly in the spirit of the pissaladiere and the tarte flambee, often with toppings that are no more than a sprinkling of rosemary, salt and olive oil. Or more elaborately, there is the addition of a few slices of tomato and a little fresh mozzarella, with the cheese lighter and less stringy than what we're used to.
That simplicity is more in keeping with the origin of pizza, which probably occurred spontaneously in different places. The likeliest explanation is this:
In areas where bread was a staple, communal ovens were traditionally fired up only once or twice a week. Since large loaves keep better than smaller ones, the standard loaf was four to nine pounds. It was only natural for the frugal bakers to throw the remaining scraps of dough into the oven while it was heating. Some dough was undoubtedly formed into small loaves -- rolls, essentially -- and some was patted into flat, pielike breads that cooked almost instantly. The temptation to top these flat breads with whatever was around was obviously irresistible. The result was pizza, or whatever you want to call it. The variations from one region to another might be merely matters of nuance or effort.
The Provencal version of the pissaladiere, for instance, is often garnished with two of the region's signature ingredients: black olives and sliced tomatoes, both in minuscule amounts by our standard. It is usually served at room temperature as often as not because in Provence, and throughout France, pizza is snack bread. Since it lacks gobs of cheese congealing on top, it retains its appeal even when cool.
Perhaps the best pissaladiere I ever had was served at Cours Saleya, the wonderful open-air market in the heart of old Nice. It was baked in a wood-burning oven a few blocks away, sent to the market by bicycle and eaten standing up or at picnic tables shaded by huge awnings. The wedges were gently sweet and intensely salty; the crust, just a half-inch thick, was perfumed with the local olive oil and was perfectly browned and crisp. It was so simple -- mostly just sweet onions on a wonderful crust. And yet it was so much more.
If pissaladiere is the most familiar of the French pizzas, galette de Perouges is the most surprising. This is the best-known product of Perouges, a well-preserved and perfectly restored medieval village not far from Lyons. Although galette is a word used for many free-form tarts in France, this particular galette seems more familiar than most: a large, round pie, slid into an oven on a paddle and cut into crisp wedges.
On closer inspection, however, and especially on tasting, this is no common variation on pizza. The crust is rich and sweet -- a yeasted dough made with butter and sugar, and rolled nearly flat. And the topping is butter and sugar; no more. Since this is remarkably fertile farmland, one of the most productive areas of France, it is perhaps not surprising that its pizza is supremely rich.
The galette is baked in a hot oven until the sugar caramelizes and the crust becomes brittle; unlike most pizzas, this dough is not chewy but crunchy. You can buy slices of the galette on the street, but it is best eaten as served at the Ostellerie du Vieux Perouges, the 500-year-old hotel-restaurant in the center of town. There, it is presented as a more formal dessert, with fresh fruit and a toupin, or tub, of creme fraiche.
The tarte flambee of Alsace may be the world's northernmost indigenous and legitimate pizza. You see it everywhere, although it is most common in the north, around Strasbourg. Alsace is French, of course, but the food, language and appearance are quite German in character. In this regional crossroads, there are many variations, based largely on the background of the baker.
Tarte flambee is a bit puffier and less flat than most pizza. Although it is usually spread with fromage blanc, bacon and onion before baking, there are many variations.
"The differences are usually based on religion," said Norbert Mueller, the owner of Chez Norbert, a restaurant in Bergheim, a village in Alsace. "Protestants, who are economical, often use much less cheese; Jews, who don't eat pork, omit the bacon, and Catholics make them as rich as possible." This last generalization may be based on the fact that Friday -- traditionally a meatless day for Catholics -- was also the day on which many ovens were fired up, so a rich tarte flambee might have been the day's main meal.
Whatever the variation, there is a peculiar convention in tarte flambee: Each wedge is rolled from the wide crust end to its point, and the rolls are eaten end to end.
Since French pizzas are so difficult to find outside France -- and are among the easiest of all pizzas to make -- it makes sense to try them at home. Drawing inspiration from what I tasted in France, and from Charles Van Over's book, "The Best Bread Ever" (Broadway, 1997), I recreated three French pizza recipes.
I took a couple of liberties, for simplicity's sake. First, I used the same dough for both pissaladiere and tarte flambee; a classic tarte flambee's dough would be made without the olive oil I use here, but I think it only enhances it.
Second, the best tarte flambee uses onions that have been salted for a day or so; salting draws out their water, which makes them milder and helps them to brown. It's a nice refinement, but not essential. And assuming that few people have access to fromage blanc, I substituted a combination of sour cream and milk, which I believe works equally well; it also makes a good stand-in for creme fraiche, if you want to serve it with a galette de Perouges.
Finally, my pizza dough recipe makes enough for two pizzas; if you're baking only one, wrap the remaining dough in plastic and freeze it for as long as a month. Then, just bring it to room temperature and pick up right where you left off.
 
DOUGH FOR PISSALADIERE OR TARTE FLAMBEE
 
Time: at least 1 hour
 1 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast
 3 cups (about 14 ounces) all-purpose or bread flour, plus more as needed
 2 teaspoons salt
 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon olive oil.
 
 1. Combine yeast, flour and salt in food processor. Turn machine on, and add 1 cup water and 2 tablespoons oil through feed tube.
 2. Process for about 30 seconds, adding more water through feed tube, a little at a time, until mixture forms a ball and is slightly sticky to the touch. If it is dry, add another tablespoon or two of water, and process for another 10 seconds. (In unlikely event that mixture is too sticky, add flour, a tablespoon at a time.)
 3. Turn dough onto floured work surface, and knead by hand for a few seconds to form a smooth, round ball. Grease bowl with remaining olive oil, and place dough in it. Cover with plastic wrap or damp cloth, and let rise in warm, draft-free area until dough just about doubles in size, or at least 1 hour. (You can also let dough rise more slowly, in refrigerator, for as long as 6 or 8 hours.)
 4. Follow recipe for pissaladiere or tarte flambee.
 Yield: Enough dough for 2 pizzas, each approximately 12 inches.
 
TARTE FLAMBEE
 
Time: 45 to 60 minutes
 
Dough for 1 tart (see recipe)
Flour for sprinkling over dough
Oil for baking sheet
1 cup fromage blanc or creme fraiche, or 3/4 cup sour cream thinned with 1/3 cup milk
 1/3 to 1/2 cup minced onions
 1/3 to 1/2 cup minced bacon
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
 
1. Preheat oven to at least 500 degrees (600 is better, if your oven goes that high). Knead dough lightly, and place it on a lightly floured surface; sprinkle it with a little more flour, and cover with plastic wrap or towel. Let it rest while oven heats.
 2. Pat or roll out dough as thinly as possible to diameter of 12 inches, using more flour or oil as necessary. The process will be easier if you allow dough to rest occasionally between rollings. If you have a pizza stone in your oven, place dough on a floured peel, or long-handled board; if you do not, lay dough on baking sheet brushed lightly with olive oil. Let dough rest for 15 to 30 minutes, or until it begins to puff ever so slightly.
 3. Spread fromage blanc or alternatives on dough. Sprinkle with onions, bacon, a little salt and plenty of pepper. Bake until nicely crisp, about 10 minutes; if tart is browning unevenly, rotate it back to front about halfway through cooking time. Serve hot.
 Yield: about 4 servings.
 
PISSALADIERE
 
Time: about 60 minutes
 
 Dough for 1 pizza (see recipe)
 Flour for sprinkling dough
 3 tablespoons olive oil
 1 1/2 pounds onions, peeled and thinly sliced
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, or 1/2 teaspoon ground thyme
 6 to 10 anchovies (optional)
 About 12 good pitted black olives, cut in half (optional)
 6 to 8 thin slices of tomato (optional).
 
 1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Knead dough lightly, and place it on lightly floured surface; sprinkle it with a little more flour, and cover with plastic wrap or towel. Let rest while oven heats and you cook the onions.
 2. Place olive oil in large skillet, and turn heat to medium-high. Add onions, along with some salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions give up their liquid and become quite soft, at least 15 minutes; do not allow onions to brown. When they are cooked, turn off heat and stir in thyme.
 3. Pat or roll out dough as thinly as possible to diameter of 12 inches, using more flour or oil as necessary. The process will be easier if you allow dough to rest occasionally between rollings. If you have a pizza stone in your oven, place dough on a floured peel, or long-handled board; if you do not, lay dough on baking sheet brushed lightly with olive oil. Let dough rest for 15 to 30 minutes, or until it begins to puff ever so slightly.
 4. Spread dough with onions, and then decorate, if you like, with anchovies, olives, and tomato. Bake until nicely crisp, 15 minutes or more; if tart is browning unevenly, rotate it back to front about halfway through cooking time. Serve hot or at room temperature.
 Yield: about 4 servings.
 
GALETTE DE PEROUGES
 
Time: about 2 hours
 
 1 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast
 2 cups flour, plus more for sprinkling
 Pinch salt
 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
 1stick cold unsalted butter, cut into chunks
 1 egg
 Zest of 1 lemon
 1 stick unsalted butter, softened.
 
 1. Combine yeast, flour, salt, tablespoon of sugar, cold butter, egg and lemon zest in food processor. Turn machine on, let it run for a second until mixture is blended, and then let machine run while you add 1/4 cup water through feed tube, a little at a time, until mixture forms a ball and is slightly sticky to the touch. If it is dry, add another tablespoon or 2 of water, and process for another 10 seconds. (In the unlikely event that mixture is too sticky, add flour, a tablespoon at a time.)
 2. Turn dough onto very lightly floured work surface, and knead by hand for a few seconds to form a smooth, round ball. Place in a bowl, covered with plastic wrap or damp cloth, and let rise in warm, draft-free area until dough just about doubles in size, or at least 1 hour. (You can also let dough rise more slowly, in refrigerator, for as long as 6 or 8 hours.)
 3. Preheat oven to at least 500 degrees (600 is better, if your oven goes that high). Knead dough lightly, and place it on a very lightly floured surface; sprinkle it with a little more flour, and cover with plastic wrap or towel. Let it rest while oven heats.
 4. Pat or roll out dough as thinly as possible to a diameter of 12 inches, using a little more flour if necessary. The process will be easier if you allow dough to rest occasionally between rollings. If you have a pizza stone in your oven, place dough on a floured peel, or long-handled board; if you do not, lay dough on lightly buttered baking sheet.
 5. Spread dough with softened butter, and sprinkle it with remaining sugar. Bake until crust is nicely crisp and sugar lightly caramelizes, about 10 minutes; if galette is browning unevenly, rotate it back to front about halfway through cooking time. Serve hot or at room temperature as a snack, or at room temperature with creme fraiche and cut-up ripe fruit.
 Yield: about 6 servings.

HEADLINE: HOT SPOTS/SILICORN VALLEY;
Meditating for Fun and Profit

BYLINE: By ANDREW BLUTH 

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Iowa

 BODY:
LOCALS call this town, tucked in the rolling hills of southeastern Iowa, Silicorn Valley. And while the landscape is covered with cornfields, the economy in this valley of 10,000 thrives largely on its abundance of start-up companies, many of them high-tech.
Indeed, Fairfield has attracted entrepreneurs from around the country, in addition to having a few who are native, and many of the start-ups have become multimillion-dollar international corporations. 
 What brings these creative business minds to this corner of Iowa? The majority are followers of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the leader of the Transcendental Meditation movement who purchased the campus of the bankrupt Parsons College here in 1974 and turned it into Maharishi University of Management.
With the Maharishi came hundreds of believers, many of whom already had business experience and diverse backgrounds. One of these is 47-year-old Cliff Rees, who came from the East Coast to Fairfield in 1985 as a co-owner of an oil company. He started Telegroup in 1989 with a friend and fellow meditator, Fred Gratzon, a 52-year-old who used to be an ice cream vendor in Fairfield.
At first the company hired a handful of other friends from the T.M. community, but now it employs more than 600 people and is the 13th largest long-distance telecommunications company in the United States. (In 1997, its total revenues were $337 million.) A Telegroup competitor, USA Global Link, is also headquartered in Fairfield and was founded by another T.M. adherent.
Sitting cross-legged in his office, Mr. Rees called meditation "a great business tool that clears my mind and allows me to focus on detail."
Maharishi University says it does not offer seed money to companies owned by T.M. people. Yet the T.M. community has played a major role in the birth of many start-ups by providing expertise.
The old guard's acceptance of new, diverse ideas has been equally instrumental. The business atmosphere is highly charged, encouraging enterprising behavior not normally found in such small settings.
But while Fairfield's leaders have welcomed the prosperity that the university has brought, they also point out that a lot of Fairfield's best entrepreneurs are in fact Iowans (but not necessarily T.M. followers).
In 1978, Dick Smith, who is not a student of T.M., founded Agri-Industrial Products. Now his company has nearly 100 employees and is the country's largest producer of orange roadside construction barrels and dozens of other plastic products.
Mr. Smith said that Fairfield has a history of entrepreneurship predating Maharishi University, and that once the groundwork is laid, it becomes even easier for new companies to develop. "There's a ripple effect," he said. "Some companies spin off new companies, and it just continues to grow."

BLOOD
An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce
By Douglas Starr
Illustrated. 441 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50
Douglas Starr points out early in this "Epic History of Medicine and Commerce" that when human blood has been broken down into derivative products, its market value is 1,600 times that of refined petroleum: about $40 for a barrel of oil compared with $67,000 for an equivalent quantity of blood. Blood, in other words, is not just a compelling, mystical symbol of the spirit of life; it is a commodity and is medically indispensable. In "Blood," Mr. Starr, the co-director of the Graduate Program in Science Journalism at Boston University, has written a fascinating history of blood, both as a challenge for scientific understanding and as a product of global business. 
 Scientific understanding, of course, had to come first, and some of the most absorbing parts of Mr. Starr's story involve excursions into medical history, when the role of blood in the body was determined and the practice of transfusing it was invented. The tales of early experimenters, like Jean-Baptiste Denis of France and the members of the Experimental Philosophy Club at Oxford, are science history at a high and exciting level. Mr. Starr covers the early experiments by which sick humans were transfused with animal blood, explaining not only why such experiments were bound to fail but why the early experimenters actually believed they had achieved some success.
These early transfusers were terribly wrong in their methods, but Mr. Starr reminds us of the major contribution they made to science. Before them, the human condition was believed to be a matter of mysterious, semi-magical humors, one of which was blood. They determined that the body was a matter of "chemicals, vessels and pumps" with blood, previously deemed a kind of magical substance, a nutrient, a biological substance.
Mr. Starr moves on to an equally riveting chapter on the practice of bleeding, which endured for 2,500 years in the West despite the fact that in almost every case it did more harm than good. His portrait of Benjamin Rush, the American founding father whose fanatical, blind devotion to bleeding as a cure-all killed many of his patients, is a study in scientific obtuseness.
What Mr. Starr calls "the modern era of transfusion medicine" began in 1908 with the work of a French researcher named Alexis Carrel, who lived in New York. Carrell invented the technique of taking blood from one person and putting it into another, sometimes, when luck prevailed, saving lives. The principle that determined success or failure was, of course, blood type, unknown to Carrell. It was discovered around the turn of the century by a brilliant Viennese named Karl Landsteiner.
Mr. Starr traces each of the scientific steps by which blood could become a commodity, sketching in along the way some interesting side implications, such as the early use of blood type in criminal or paternity investigations and the historical significance of hemophilia in Russian history. (It brought the mystic healer Rasputin to the Romanov court.) But the bulk of the volume is devoted to the second element in the history of blood, its role as an increasingly important international product that had to be collected, broken down into its constituent parts, stored and sold.
"In every epoch, people had seen blood as more than it really was -- more than a liquid or component of their body, but as a reflection of their image and understanding of themselves," Mr. Starr writes. He is speaking of the way World War II accelerated research into the techniques of blood transfusion, so that a wounded soldier was given blood he had donated months before. "Blood, once held in religious regard, had been removed from a man's circulatory system, separated, processed, freeze-dried, packaged, shipped and reconstituted -- only to be injected into the same individual in a completely different form several months later and half a world away."
Mr. Starr tells all this in sprightly, vigorous fashion, smoothly explaining the technical side of things, adding colorful descriptions of a large international cast of characters here and there. Sometimes he piles on a bit too much detail, as, for example, when he describes the blood bank system as it evolved in a half-dozen countries. Still, the narrative generally moves briskly as Mr. Starr recounts the full and sometimes very dark story.
He tells, for example, of hideous experiments performed on prisoners by Josef Mengele-like Japanese researchers during the World War II, and, in the late 1960's and 70's, the morally troubling concentration of blood collection centers in poor countries like Nicaragua, which became a source of blood products for the rich, industrialized world. Vast profits were made by a new sort of entrepreneur, the international blood broker. In Nicaragua, this global economic system, in which the bodies of the poor were a kind of raw material for the rich, became a focus of revolutionary anger against the dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle.
But Mr. Starr foreshadows his story, then ends it with the most troubling episode in the history of blood as a commodity: the spread of the AIDS virus in contaminated blood. His foreshadowing has to do with the sensational 1992 trial of four French bureaucrats, three of whom were convicted of failing to stop the use of H.I.V.-contaminated blood products in thousands of transfusions. Mr. Starr's history of this incident is a gripping piece of reporting.
He stresses the French illusion that, because their blood collection system was based entirely on voluntary, unpaid donations, the supply was safe. And even when that illusion died, the failure to adopt sterilization techniques and the unwillingness to destroy valuable stocks of available blood "condemned thousands of French citizens to AIDS."
For a time, in other words, blood became a dubious commodity, one that killed as well as saved, until effective steps were taken to insure the safety of the product. The efforts to do that mark a final chapter in a rich story admirably told in this book.

A Rape and Beating, Later 3 Murders And Then the Twist

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
The young women whom Brandon Teena dated all agree about one thing. Brandon, a fresh-faced 21-year-old Nebraskan who was raped and beaten by two acquaintances on Christmas Eve in 1993, then shot to death with two others by the same pair a week later, knew how to treat a woman. He was courtly and sent flowers and was an excellent kisser. Growing up, the star he most idolized was Cher.
Even after Brandon's girlfriend, Lana Tisdel, discovered he was really a woman (he was born Teena Brandon) undergoing hormone therapy in anticipation of a possible sex change operation, she did not recoil in horror. But in the eyes of Brandon's male friends, Thomas Nissen and John Lotter, two shiftless young men from the rural Nebraska town of Falls City, to which he had just moved from Lincoln, once they discovered his sex, he became a freak. They felt at once betrayed and sickened. 
 "The Brandon Teena Story," Susan Muska and Greta Olafsdottir's riveting, understated documentary, bends over backward not to sensationalize a murder case that encapsulates the deep-seated fears about gender and alternative sexuality harbored by millions of Americans, especially those living in the heartland. Falls City, an economically depressed small town with an all-white population of just under 5,000, epitomizes that sprawling rural and semi-rural section of the United States that might be described as the Land of the Pickup Truck.
Those who live and work here may have heard of gay liberation, but they've never met an uncloseted gay or transgendered person and have no desire to do so. Although Falls City prides itself on being a close-knit, God-fearing community, we learn that it has a high rate of domestic violence. You can sense these ominous undercurrents during a scene at a local demolition derby where all the men are toting guns.
The film methodically interviews the surviving principals, including the killers, both of whom were convicted of first-degree murder and are now in prison, one of them (Mr. Lotter) on death row. We meet Brandon's parents, who talk sympathetically about their dead child's troubled life. Brandon had suicidal tendencies, and having no other means of support, eked out a living by forging checks.
When we first meet the killers, who are interviewed separately, they seem nice enough, although we later learn that each had already served time in prison. As they recall their early friendship with Brandon, it's obvious that they liked him and were fooled by his sexual charade. What's so unnerving about the movie, which opens today at the Film Forum, is how unemotional most of their recollections are. Their voices are as flat and uninflected as the austere Nebraskan landscape.
The film's most casually horrifying note is sounded by the sheriff in charge of the rape case, who offhandedly refers to the victim as "it." Because of his failure to prosecute the rape case vigorously, Mr. Nissen and Mr. Lotter were free to track Brandon down at a farmhouse on New Year's Eve and kill Brandon and his companions, 24-year-old Lisa Lambert and her friend Philip Devine, a visitor who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
The grisly details of the murders are reconstructed through audio recordings made during Mr. Nissen's 1995 murder trial. Mr. Nissen, in exchange for testifying against Mr. Lotter, was spared the death penalty but sentenced to three consecutive life terms. Mr. Lotter's appeals are awaiting review by the United States Supreme Court.
"The Brandon Teena Story" shows us that in the Land of the Pickup Truck, the hatred and fear of unorthodox sexuality run deep. Instead of being shouted, it festers until it explodes in acts of violence whose cause even the killers themselves don't seem to comprehend fully.

HEADLINE: That's a Wrap: A Fad's Fade-Out

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
JUST last summer, Wrap-a-Rama was a bustling, happy little food shop on lower Second Avenue in Manhattan, serving up yummy meals with names like "Tikka Break" and drinks like strawberry-banana smoothies. Regulars crowded in for the wraps -- burrito style sandwiches filled with foods from around the world, like Indian chicken or Greek salad -- and to sit at painted tables and watch the East Village go by.
Then one day, Wrap-a-Rama was gone. So was the Wrap Shack, its competitor around the corner. The story was the same in major cities from Chicago to Los Angeles. 
 Just two years ago, tiny stores selling wraps sprang up like weeds, enticing curious eaters with their eclectic ingredients and low-caloric, healthful claims.
But like so many food trends whose allure is their hipness factor, many wrap shops were mowed down by fast-moving competitors or by mainstream food purveyors like Wendy's and Au Bon Pain, which both offered cheaper knockoffs.
Indeed wraps, like so many start-up concepts, were in many ways victims of their own success, signaling a cautionary tale for other future restaurateurs and food purveyors. Not unlike crepes in the 70's, frozen yogurt in the 80's and juice bars in this decade, wraps have been co-opted, and in many cases, defeated.
"When we opened the store in 1996, it was very good," said Ranjit Singh, the owner of the defunct Wrap-a-Rama, which he got going with $120,000 in personal savings combined with money from two partners. "But then a lot of other food operators started offering wrap variations, and suddenly you didn't have to go to wrap stores anymore. We were just breaking even."
At its height, the shop brought in sales of about $1,300 a week, but profits were scant.
It could be that the concept is not special enough, said Mr. Singh, who returned to his native London to work in a conveyor-belt sushi restaurant, in which you sit and the food travels by.
"Food is like clothing," he said. "If there is a hot item at Macy's, it will be all over the New York streets. Then it's only in fashion a short while. I now call that my M.B.A. year."
Although there are no numbers on wrap-store start-ups and failures, most food-industry experts agree it has been a volatile business. No one knew the volatility would come so quickly.
"In all my years in the food business," said David Barrows, the chief executive of World Wrapps, an early wrap chain, "I have never seen anything copied so fast or in so many numbers. Even the story of how this business was started was copied."
The great wrap struggle also underscores how risky food businesses are in comparison with other start-up retail ventures.
"More Americans want to start restaurants than anything else, and yet restaurants have the highest failure rate," said Rieva Lesonsky, the editorial director of Entrepreneur magazine.
Unlike accessories stores, for example, food shops are expensive to open. You need a stove, a giant refrigerator and other storage places, as well as packaging for the finished product and plenty of labor. There are health regulations that are costly to meet, and copycats spring up almost instantaneously, since it's difficult to keep the ingredients of a gussied-up sandwich a secret.
The genesis of the wrap has become part of entreprenurial lore. Four supereducated pals, Matthew Blair, Keith Cox, Eduardo Rallo Verdugo and Will Weisman, were vacationing in Mexico in 1994, trying to think of a joint business venture. Recalling their love of burritos, they came up with the wrap. The first store, World Wrapps, in San Francisco, was capitalized with a small investment from friends.
First-year sales were about $1 million. Two of the founders returned to business school, but two remained on the management team. Today, World Wrapps has 26 stores altogether in California and in Seattle. Refusing to give sales or earnings figures, Mr. Barrows, the chief executive, said there are plans for more stores.
When they came on the market, wraps seemed to fit perfectly with eating and life-style trends of the 90's: billed as more healthful than sandwiches -- which in many cases was a function of marketing, not reality -- and often sold in combination with fresh-fruit smoothie drinks, they played on Americans' obsession with eating better on the run.
The wrap also invoked fusion foods, which mix ingredients from two or more cultures, a fad that persists in other restaurants as well. Wraps may have a south-of-the-border look, but can be stuffed with Thai chicken, Caribbean shrimp or goat cheese.
With so much going for it, why did the fad fizzle, leaving so many entrepreneurs belly up?
"A wrap is a menu category," said Dennis Lombardi, who runs the restaurant group at Technomic, a food-service consulting firm in Chicago. "But it is not necessarily the basis for a whole line of concepts."
AS a menu category, many fast-food chains have been quick to steal it. TGI Friday's, Wendy's, Long John Silver and Au Bon Pain are just a few of the large chains that added wraps to their menus after World Wrapps took off. Although their versions were less exotic and not as fresh, they were less expensive and, compared with the hamburgers and fried fish being sold alongside them, seemed less sinful in terms of fat and calories.
The mainstream's acceptance raised the wrap's profile but also diluted its coolness, which for many wrap entrepreneurs was disastrous.
"I think there has been overexposure," said James Pappas, who owns Original Wrap City, a Manhattan store.
Moreover, wraps are essentially a lunchtime meal; a wrap shop cannot cater easily to a breakfast or a dinner crowd, when McDonald's and the like are buzzing. "And there is lots of competition for lunch," Mr. Lombardi said. "If you have a group going to lunch, and one person vetos the wrap place, they all go to Wendy's, and the person who wants a wrap can get one there."
Consumers hold wrap stores to tougher standards than other fast-food establishments when it comes to quality. "I think consumers care more about what is in the wrap than the wrap themselves," said John McMillen, a food analyst at Prudential Securities. "And maybe some of those stores didn't cut it in the middle."
Such was the case of Todo Wraps, a Seattle-based chain that World Wrapps acquired a year and a half ago. Mr. Barrows said that when they picked up the chain, the company's locations were strong, but it was selling a limited menu with dull vegetable wraps and cheaper meats and fish than World Wrapps used. Fresh salmon and exotic spices were added, and those stores have much higher sales now, he says, though he declined to give financial information about the company.
Suffice it to say that variety counts. World Wrapps offers 18 different types (most stores offer about 10), and the teriyaki chicken and other fillings can be purchased over rice, not wrapped.
Julie Malveaux, a spokeswoman for the National Restaurant Association in Washington, was more direct. "I can't say why certain wrap restaurants are closing," she said. "But what I notice about the ones that are viable is that they have changing menus, pairing wraps with smoothies or other health-conscious drinks. They remind me of coffee shops when they first took off."
Mr. Barrows suggested a slightly different recipe for surviving and thriving. "Taking the high-quality road makes for a success," he said. "But it is not easy to do that."

HEADLINE: A Museum In Mexico Suddenly Shuts Down

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 22

 BODY:
With no fanfare and surprisingly little mourning, a museum that critics had extolled as Mexico's finest forum for modern art was closed on Sunday, a victim of cost slashing at the leading television network, Televisa.
The museum, the Cultural Center for Contemporary Art, shut its doors at the Spartan but spacious rust-colored building where it had offered 172 exhibitions over 12 years, including authoritative retrospectives of Mexican artists like the painter Maria Izquierdo and the photographers Manuel Alvarez Bravo and his first wife, Lola. 
 The museum was created from scratch out of a collaboration between Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, the billionaire owner of Televisa, who died last year; his friend Robert R. Littman, a New Yorker who directed the museum from its founding, and Paula Cussi, a Mexican actress whose love affair and eventual marriage to Mr. Azcarraga lasted two and a half decades.
The Cultural Center became a respectable stop on the international circuit, after shows like an affectionate 1987 homage to Leo Castelli, the New York art impresario, and a 1990 display of Salvador Dali works from the Reina Sofia National Art Museum in Madrid. Thriving on ample budgets from Televisa, the museum accumulated a distinctive collection of works by young artists from Mexico, the United States and Europe.
Although Televisa officials said the center would continue to operate as a museum-without-walls by lending its collection for shows in other spaces, considerable confusion seems to surround its future.
"Things are completely unclarified to me," Mr. Littman said. He said he would pack up the center's collection to store it in a warehouse at a Televisa complex in a suburb above the capital city.
Televisa officials have indicated that the building that housed the museum, originally a press center for the 1984 World Cup soccer championships, would be sold or let for commercial purposes yet to be determined.
For now, only 15 works from the permanent collection, by American artists including Edward Ruscha and Brice Marden, will be hung in the residence of the United States Ambassador, Jeffrey Davidow, which is not regularly open to the public.
Although there were few protests from Mexican artists, leaders of Mexico's art world were appalled by Televisa's decision to close the Cultural Center and dismiss its 120-member staff to save the $12 million devoted to its annual budget.
"This is like a divorce where only one party makes the decision," said Raquel Tibol, the longtime art critic for the weekly magazine Proceso. "It is an action by a private company that fails to respect the tacit cultural agreement between a museum and its public."
But Televisa officials said they could no longer afford the Cultural Center under the austerity regimen the company adopted after the death of Mr. Azcarraga, a strong-willed magnate known as the Tiger, who built his family's business into one of the largest media empires in the world. A son, Emilio Azcarraga Jean, who is 30, took over the conglomerate after his father's death.
Ms. Cussi had caught the elder Azcarraga's eye in the early days of her career at Televisa when she was reading horoscopes on the air. Although she had no expertise in modern art or experience as a museum curator, he made her chairwoman of the center and appointed Mr. Littman to direct it.
"Paula is a very smart lady and a very quick study," Mr. Littman said. "To stay with Emilio for 25 years, you have to know about politics, art, entertainment, economics. She was very conversant, and she spent a lot of time researching."
As the museum's reputation grew, Azcarraga's support became more enthusiastic. For most of his lifetime Televisa had a monopoly hammerlock on television in Mexico, and he was frequently criticized for producing crass programming to appeal to the lowest common denominator among Mexican viewers. The Cultural Center allowed him to show that he could make a sophisticated contribution to Mexican culture.
"He really enjoyed coming to the openings," Mr. Littman recalled. "It was an important part of his life. Emilio had many opportunities to kiss us goodbye, but he never did."
The museum's popularity in Mexico was established in 1988 with a show that brought together images of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's patroness saint. In 1990 Mr. Littman organized an exhibition by Robert Motherwell and other artists from around the world to illustrate essays of art criticism by Octavio Paz, the Mexican poet.
But relations between Ms. Cussi and the Azcarraga family cooled after the death of the elder Azcarraga, from whom she was separated in 1994. In August 1997 she severed her all her ties to Televisa when she sold the company shares that he had left her in his will, for a figure estimated in Mexican press reports at $40 million.
Initially the younger Mr. Azcarraga made a public pledge in front of all of Televisa's employees to keep the museum open. But financial pragmatism, in the wake of a punishing recession in 1995, prevailed.
Gaston Melo, a Televisa vice president, said the company was not planning to sell off the permanent collection.
"Selling has never been the point," Mr. Melo said. He said Televisa was negotiating with public universities and Government museums for shows of the collection.
The museum's demise provoked little outcry among Mexican artists, most of whom remain suspicious of Televisa. But its closing leaves the cultivation of modern art in Mexico almost entirely with Government museums.
"We provided an independent focus on the visual arts," Mr. Littman said. "We didn't have to do a show because the President of Mexico signed a peace treaty with Lower Slobovia."
Mrs. Tibol, the art critic, said: "There is absolutely no one left who can fill the void. No one even aspires to doing it. There is a spiritual reluctance to barge into the abandoned house that someone else built."

HEADLINE: For Indie Films, 1979's Lark Turns Into This Year's Institution

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
When Sandra Schulberg rented a screening room in Manhattan in 1979 to show 20 new films to producers and distributors, she felt as if she was doing something radical. "The intention was to try to create an alternate film economy," said Ms. Schulberg, a filmmaker herself. "I did not see it becoming an institution."
Nearly 20 years later, independent films have become a regular part of the cultural vocabulary, and the Independent Feature Film Market started by Ms. Schulberg has become an important early showcase for films like "My Dinner With Andre," "Welcome to the Dollhouse," "Roger and Me" and "The Brothers McMullen." 
 This year's market, which began on Friday and runs through this Friday, includes some 700 filmmakers and about 1,300 other people in the industry who come to make connections and find new talent. Films are shown at the Angelika Film Center, at 18 West Houston Street in Greenwich Village, and surrounding locations.
Filmmakers who want to show their work submit videotapes with a registration fee of $275 to $450, depending on the length of the film and the timing of the submission. This year, the number of projects on the market, including unproduced scripts, is roughly 400, said Michelle Byrd, the executive director of the Independent Feature Project, the country's largest membership organization for independent filmmakers, which administers the market.
Among the more talked-about projects this year, Ms. Byrd said, are "LaMastas," described at the market's on-line site (www.ifp.org) as a " 'Forrest Gump' meets 'Goodfellas,' " and "The Accident," a memoir filmed over 25 years. Ken Liotti said his film "The Waiting Game" is also one of the "hot" ones. "The buzz we've gotten is incredible," Mr. Liotti said. "All the festivals have approached us. Now we're on the map, which is the purpose of doing it."
Mr. Liotti, 40, said he wrote, directed and produced his 88-minute film -- about the misadventures of struggling actors who wait on tables -- after writing for Hollywood and never seeing his films produced. "I've been in development hell for 10 years," he said. "I wanted to see one of my movies up on the screen."
In addition to screenings, the market features several seminars every day, including "Who's Who in the Documentary World," "Coaching Screenwriters: Accessing Resources and Developing Strategies" and "How to Pitch to HBO Documentary Programming."
This year's market will reunite several alumni and a screening series at the Anthology Film Archives, on Second Street at Second Avenue in the East Village, to highlight 10 of the market's major previous films, including "Down by Law," "Daughters of the Dust" and "Stand and Deliver."
In addition, the market will present its second annual Gordon Parks Awards, which gives $10,000 to an African-American director and $10,000 to an African-American screenwriter. The Independent Feature Project says these awards helped increase the participation of black filmmakers in the market over the last two years from 16 in 1996 to 55 this year.

HEADLINE: Needed: A Fed for the World

BYLINE: By Jeffrey E. Garten; Jeffrey E. Garten is dean of the Yale School of Management and the author of "The Big Ten: The Big Emerging Markets and How They Will Change Our Lives."

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
Even as emerging markets sink into depression and stocks plunge from Montreal to Melbourne, a global economy is slowly emerging, albeit in a tortuous and painful way. But governments seem paralyzed, unable to deal with both the crisis and the opportunity.
Today's chaotic international market mirrors how the American economy evolved between the Civil War and the 1930's. For well over half a century we, too, had booms and busts, countless bank failures, rampant bankruptcies. Capitalism was an uncontrollable Darwinian process, with big winners and big losers. 
 But over time the United States set up crucial central institutions -- the Securities and Exchange Commission (1933), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (1934) and, most important, the Federal Reserve (1913). In so doing, America became a managed national economy. These organizations were created to make capitalism work, to prevent destructive business cycles and to moderate the harsh, invisible hand of Adam Smith.
This is what now must occur on a global scale. The world needs an institution that has a hand on the economic rudder when the seas become stormy. It needs a global central bank.
The sad fact is that we cannot rely on existing institutions or on national leaders for global economic stability.
The International Monetary Fund knows how to deal with one or a few countries at a time, but not an international phenomenon in which all countries' problems occur at once and are linked. The World Bank's mission has included financing big projects and alleviating poverty, but it is not designed for financial crises.
Simply trying to coordinate the world's powerful central banks -- the Fed and the new European Central Bank, for instance -- wouldn't work, either. If there is no inflation in the United States, the Fed won't lower interest rates simply because that would help, say, Southeast Asia. Such global responsibility is not in the Fed's charter. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, seems proud of its narrow focus on Europe. The result is inadequate attention to the three-quarters of the world consisting of emerging markets.
Effective collaboration among finance ministries and treasuries is also unlikely to materialize. These agencies are responsible to elected legislatures, and politics in the industrial countries is more preoccupied with internal events than with international stability.
An independent central bank with responsibility for maintaining global financial stability is the only way out. No one else can do what is needed: inject more money into the system to spur growth, reduce the sky-high debts of emerging markets, and oversee the operations of shaky financial institutions.
A global central bank could provide more money to the world economy when it is rapidly losing steam. For example, it could buy the bonds of the Central Bank of Brazil, thereby injecting hard currency into that country when it most needs the help (like right now). It would have the ability to buy a country's debt at steep discounts, a crucial need now because in countries like Thailand and Venezuela debts are piling up and preventing new lending and new investment. Ultimately a lot of this debt could be resold at a profit.
Such a bank would play an oversight role for banks and other financial institutions everywhere, providing some uniform standards for prudent lending in places like China and Mexico. The regulation need not be heavy-handed; providing clear and reasonably verified information to the market on the real state of banks around the world would be a leap forward. Investors could then make the informed judgments that they couldn't have made in, say, Russia or Indonesia.
None of these functions are being performed effectively now, and it will be impossible to have a world economy that doesn't resemble a reckless roller coaster unless they are.
There are two ways a global central bank could be financed. It could have lines of credit from all central banks, drawing on them in bad times and repaying when the markets turn up. Alternately -- and admittedly more difficult to carry out -- it could be financed by a very modest tariff on all trade, collected at the point of importation, or by a tax on certain global financial transactions.
One thing that would not be acceptable would be for the bank to be at the mercy of short-term-oriented legislatures. Witness how the United States Congress has consistently failed to provide new money for the I.M.F. even as the world economy slides toward deep recession.
A crucial political question is, To whom would a global central bank be accountable? It would have too much power to be governed only by technocrats, although it must be led by the best of them. One possibility would be to link the new bank to an enlarged Group of Seven -- perhaps a "G-15" that would include the G-7 plus rotating members like Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Poland, India, China and South Korea.
Another issue is the relationship between a global bank and the Fed. There would have to be very close collaboration. The global bank would not operate within the United States, and it would not be able to override the decisions of our central bank. But it could supply the missing international ingredient -- emergency financing for cash-starved emerging markets. It wouldn't affect American mortgage rates, but it could help the profitability of American multinational companies by creating a healthier global environment for their businesses.
It is never easy to create a new institution; too many people have vested interests in the status quo. Moreover, when these new structures are most needed, officials are preoccupied with managing the current crisis. When calm is restored, attention turns to something else. But the current global financial slide, with no one at the center to limit the damage, is evidence enough that there is a huge gap in the structures necessary to make globalization work.
As the eminent economic historian Charles Kindleberger said in examining the causes of the Depression, "For the world economy to be stabilized, there has to be a stabilizer, one stabilizer." He was commenting on the lack of leadership by America in the 1930's. Today, with the United States still showing no appetite for such a role, a global central bank could be an enormous help.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Dip, in Unusual Tandem With Wall Street

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of United States Treasury securities fell for the first time in five days yesterday despite weakness in stocks.
Analysts said investors might have been a little reluctant to buy at current prices with yield levels, which move inversely to prices, already at historic lows. 
 The 30-year bond's price fell 19/32, to 105 8/32. Its yield rose to 5.15 percent, from 5.12 percent Monday.
For most of the last two months the bond market has derived strength from the selloff in stocks, reflecting moves by investors around the world to the relative safety of Treasury securities. So it was considered unusual that both bonds and stocks fell yesterday.
Some analysts attributed the bond weakness to uncertainty over what the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee will do at its meeting next Tuesday. While speculation has increased that the Federal Open Market Committee may move to lower rates, which could help soothe anxiety in global markets, there is no obvious reason for reduced rates in the United States, where the economy is showing resilience.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said, "At the very least, the F.O.M.C. will adopt a bias toward easing at this meeting, but the probability of an actual easing at this juncture has increased markedly and may well be more likely."
Others were more emphatic in their prediction that the Fed would move to ease rates. Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist at the DKB Securities (USA) Corporation, said in his latest market report that the Fed would take such a step because of deepening distress in emerging markets, the threat of global deflation and some signs of slowing economic growth in the United States.
Additional insight into the economy's performance will emerge later this week when the Commerce Department releases a revision to the second-quarter gross domestic product number, along with August data for durable goods orders, personal income and consumer spending.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, whose ambiguous remarks about interest rates last week contributed to a large selloff in stocks, will be testifying today before the Senate Budget Committee.
Also today, the Treasury will sell $15 billion of new two-year notes, which by late yesterday were being offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 4.62 percent.

HEADLINE: Keeping Asia Liquid

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Preventing World Recession" (editorial, Sept. 17): With roughly 40 percent of the world in recession, it is imperative that the International Monetary Fund be provided with the $18 billion requested by the Clinton Administration. But I.M.F. financing is only a first step. 
 The Federal Reserve should also cut interest rates and loosen monetary policy. This would provide the liquidity without which Asia, Eastern Europe and South America would fail to stabilize. The flight of dollars from the developing world and depreciating local currencies have prevented affected economies from recovering their economic footing.
Making capital more available to them through lower interest rates and greater cash flow would help countries like those along the Pacific Rim grow their way out of recession. The economic deterioration that continues in much of the world must be stopped, and it is up to the United States to lead.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
U.S. Trade Official Says China Market Is Closed Tighter

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 22

 BODY:
A senior American trade official today criticized what he called China's unwillingness to open its markets to foreign companies, and accused the Chinese of tightening some restrictions on foreign businesses.
The remarks by the official, David L. Aaron, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, reflected what has become an increasingly tense trade relationship between Beijing and Washington. 
 Mr. Aaron said China's policies had helped produce a $1 billion-a-week trade deficit for Americans. He said the United States would look for new ways to press China into allowing improved access for American businesses to the nation's 1.2 billion people if the situation did not improve. "They have taken this relationship for granted," Mr. Aaron said, adding later, "The list of barriers is just getting bigger and we're not crossing anything off the list -- that's the problem."
Mr. Aaron, who was in Beijing to attend a conference and meet with Chinese officials, offered hope that the huge trading partners could ultimately cooperate. But the polite discussions on trade that surrounded President Clinton's visit here this spring have evidently given way to exasperation and blunt talk. Mr. Aaron characterized his meetings with the Chinese as "somewhat somber."
"We recognize that the Chinese have lots of difficult problems to face," Mr. Aaron told a small group of reporters, listing the broad Asian economic crisis, troubled state-owned enterprises and this summer's disastrous floods. "But my job is to make sure that on that list of problems is this trade deficit and the treatment of businesses here."
United States figures show the trade deficit with China exceeding $50 billion annually, and growing.
Mr. Aaron's admonitions came after a tense few weeks in which new American regulations banned imported goods from China packed in untreated wood crates or pallets, a ban that may well affect more than half of Chinese exports to the United States.
American officials say the new requirements are necessary to prevent further invasions by the Asian long-horned beetle, which in the last two years has emerged from Chinese raw-wood packing material to kill thousands of trees in New York and Chicago. But Chinese trade officials say the regulations were motivated not by bugs but by protectionism.
"The unilateral action taken by the United States could impact the normal development of Sino-American trade," China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said in a statement last week.
Although the United States has for years wanted Beijing to further open its markets, it had hoped China's stated desire to join the World Trade Organization would take care of the problem, since free markets are a condition of membership. But the Chinese Government has apparently accepted that it will not gain admission to the trade organization now, and the United States has been left to apply pressure on its own.
Today, Mr. Aaron said that barriers to American business in China seemed to be multiplying rather than shrinking.
He said, for example, that the authorities here had generally not let foreign companies develop a distribution network for their goods, and he complained of China's unwillingness to grant licenses to foreign companies in such service businesses as insurance. In the last few years, a number of American companies have established offices in Beijing, anticipating that such licenses would be approved.
Mr. Aaron also complained that the huge Chinese telecommunications market was mostly off limits to foreign companies and noted that the Government was contemplating banning the few foreign companies that had indirect investment in that industry.
China has created many more subtle barriers as well, Mr. Aaron said, such as increasingly cumbersome regulations on foreign currency transactions. He cited a resurgence in counterfeiting that was now so professional that copycat goods even carried fake Underwriters Laboratories seals.
"If W.T.O. isn't moving us toward market access and opening, we're going to have to find other methods," he said, adding that the Clinton Administration was now "looking at other options."
Officially, Mr. Aaron was in Beijing to attend a conference on Chinese energy needs and to talk to officials in preparation for the annual meeting of the Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade, a Chinese-American panel, in Washington next month. He said he was still optimistic that such joint forums could help resolve trade disputes, at least in some cases.
Chinese officials say the American trade deficit is not nearly as large as United States officials contend, maintaining that it is closer to $20 billion than $50 billion.

HEADLINE: Rising Costs in Health Care

 BODY:
A report by economists at the Department of Health and Human Services predicts that growth in health-care spending will increase substantially over the next 10 years. Total health expenditures are expected to rise from $1 trillion in 1996 to $2.1 trillion by 2007, jumping from 13.6 percent of gross domestic product to 16.6 percent. That is likely to translate into much higher health insurance premium increases than has been the case in recent years. These numbers are discouraging, particularly since the projections do not even reach the years when baby boomers will begin utilizing health care intensively in their late 60's and 70's.
The relatively low growth in spending of the past four years is actually an aberration from long-term trends, made possible by a rapid shift of American workers into managed-care plans from costly fee-for-service plans where there were few constraints on what doctors and hospitals could charge or patients could request. Many economists have said for some time, however, that this tamping down of costs is a one-time effect achieved mostly by getting price discounts out of hospital systems and squeezing down doctors' fees. 
 The long-term ability of managed care to control escalating costs is likely to be more modest. Although it can help by subjecting doctors' decisions to review and emphasizing preventive care, managed care has not been able to resist consumer demands for expensive technological procedures, a big driver of health spending. Changing practice standards and new and more expensive drugs will continue to push up spending even after managed care squeezes the easy-to-attack inefficiencies out of the health delivery system. The growth of point-of-service plans where enrollees have greater choice of doctors may further weaken managed care's ability to control costs.
This country already spends more on health care as a share of gross domestic product than any other nation, yet 41 million Americans have no health coverage at all. The shift toward managed care has produced a few good years of relatively stable costs. But it has not reduced the problem of the uninsured. With costs starting to accelerate again, the hope that managed care could extract enough savings out of the system to cover millions of uninsured Americans seems less and less likely.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Obuchi Break Ice but Solve No Economic Problems

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
President Clinton and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan met for the first time yesterday and struggled to reassure the markets that they agree on a common strategy to pull the world's second-largest economy out of a recession that is fueling economic turmoil on three continents.
But after nearly three hours of meetings in New York, the two leaders emerged with no agreement about what Japan will do about the trillion dollars in bad debts that have acted like an anchor on the world economy. 
 Their chief areas of agreement, aides said, were a shared concern about North Korea, a decision to meet again early next year and the politically mandatory promise to call each other by their first names.
While trying to sound upbeat, American officials acknowledge that they emerged from the meeting with no better sense of how Mr. Obuchi planned to resolve a politically paralyzing debate over the bank debt that is already threatening the Prime Minister's loose grasp on power.
The bad bank debts now overshadow trade disputes and growing security concerns in the Pacific as the No. 1 issue between the two countries. The tower of debt has frozen economic activity, forced Japan to keep insolvent banks afloat and set off waves of turmoil far beyond Japan's own shores.
In a brief and carefully stage-managed appearance with Mr. Obuchi, President Clinton acknowledged that an "immensely complicated political situation" in Japan limited the Prime Minister's options.
Indeed, the divisions among the political parties in Japan are so complex that Mr. Obuchi was unable to address Mr. Clinton's main concern: Tokyo's vow to use tens of billions of dollars in public funds to prop up some of the world's largest banks.
As the two men met, a political deal to merge or nationalize the virtually insolvent Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, a huge financial institution, appeared to be unraveling in Tokyo.
"The Prime Minister made it clear that they were working very hard on this legislation, that there are a lot of moving pieces, and he did not make a commitment," Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said yesterday afternoon.
Meetings with American presidents are always important for Japanese prime ministers. No matter what the subject of the session, it is critical for a new Japanese leader to demonstrate that he can hold his own with an American president and fend off, when necessary, the incessantly demanding Americans.
To bolster the Prime Minster, the White House planned to fly the two leaders to the Rockefeller estate in Tarrytown, where they could hold their meeting in a bucolic setting. But fog kept their helicopters grounded, and the meeting was held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Park Avenue.
What made this meeting unusual was that it was also important for Mr. Clinton, at several levels. Without resolving Japan's problems, Mr. Clinton's hopes of calming the world financial turmoil -- a task he committed himself to in a speech last week at the Council on Foreign Relations -- would be greatly impaired, if not doomed.
More immediately, the session was the latest opportunity for Mr. Clinton to demonstrate that he is focusing on substantive issues despite the continuing jockeying in Washington over impeachment proceedings or a possible censure.
Mr. Clinton insisted to reporters at one point yesterday that he had ignored the televised deluge of testimony and commentary. "Believe it or not, I haven't read the report," he said, referring to Kenneth Starr's referral to Congress.
But as a political diversion, the meeting with Mr. Obuchi did not amount to much.
The lack of progress came as little surprise to the Administration. This was the fourth time in 18 months that Mr. Clinton has urged a Japanese prime minister to act quickly on resolving the banking crisis that has frozen lending and investment throughout Asia.
But despite the series of running meetings between the two countries in Tokyo, San Francisco and Washington, there is little to show in the way of progress -- beyond resentment of American pressure in Japan and frustration at Japanese intransigence in Washington.
The American strategy for dealing with Japan has been to coordinate a series of increasingly urgent-sounding warnings -- first from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Mr. Summers, then from Germany and other European countries, and most recently from the International Monetary Fund. The problem is how to direct those critiques.
In an interview on Monday and at a news conference yesterday, Mr. Obuchi appeared to agree with the broad outlines of the American strategy: to pump money into viable banks and force the sale of real estate that has been sitting on the banks' books -- mostly unsold, because the banks do not want to have to confront how far prices have fallen.
But striking that deal involves finding common ground among the strongest political forces in Japan. Among them are banks and companies that finance the country's political parties, particularly Mr. Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party. And then there are the opposition leaders, in control of the upper house of Parliament, who reflect the popular distaste for bailing out badly run banks and real estate moguls.
Mr. Obuchi seemed to reflect the difficulty of weaving through that minefield yesterday when he said he was "neither optimistic nor pessimistic" about the chances of getting financial reforms through Parliament. Taking a line from Mr. Clinton, he said that "this is not only an issue for Japan, but something that has major implications on economies of Asia as well as the whole world."
In his interview on Monday, Mr. Obuchi acknowledged that he had yet to convince the Japanese public or Parliament that the issue went beyond Japan's domestic interests. But he argued that he had been underestimated, a point he made obliquely to Mr. Clinton today when he noted that he had been compared in the American press to "cold pizza," a slight that clearly annoyed Japanese bureaucrats.
Mr. Clinton, his aides said, reassured Mr. Obuchi that he had eaten cold pizza the night before in his hotel.

HEADLINE: One Patch of Russia's Economic Crazy Quilt

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: KRASNOYARSK, Russia, Sept. 18

 BODY:
With the rugged stoicism that typifies this vast Siberian territory, Nina V. Popova thought she could ride out Russia's economic storm.
But last week tax inspectors barged into her small food shop. After poring through her ledgers, they warned her she had violated Gov. Aleksandr Lebed's new "anti-crisis" decree. 
 "They said we can only charge 10 percent more than we pay for the food," she said. "But we have to pay for electricity and heat. We have to pay for security, and we have to pay salaries. If they force this decree on us we simply won't survive."
Russia's financial crisis has not only rocked Moscow's political establishment. It has also stirred many of Russia's far-flung regions to set their own economic course and establish price controls.
A former general, presidential hopeful and the new governor of this Siberian region, Mr. Lebed has led the charge. Angry at the soaring prices that have stunned Russians, Mr. Lebed has not just declared war on inflation. He has tried to make it illegal.
He is hardly alone. From the northwestern city of Novgorod to the western territory of Yakutia, authorities are taking a page out of the socialist playbook and intervening to set prices.
Russia is fast becoming a crazy quilt of zones with Draconian price controls, territories with milder price restrictions and regions with no controls at all.
The populist decrees have brought a measure of comfort to consumers shocked by sharp jumps in prices for food and medicine.
"We may infringe on the rights of people but it is in their interest," Mr. Lebed said in interview. "The strict measures have played their role and soon will be abolished."
But the stop-gap controls also contain the seeds of new problems. Stores and factories complain they are being denied the profit they need to weather Russia's raging economic storm. Shortages have emerged, as producers ship their goods to regions where prices run free.
Virtually nobody thinks the controls are a substitute for a national strategy to rescue Russia from its economic malaise.
But with Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov still struggling to form a national Cabinet, there is no overarching plan.
Mr. Lebed owes his job to Krasnoyarsk's economic distress. Tapping the deep well of discontent, Mr. Lebed scored an upset victory over the region's incumbent Governor in a bitterly contested race last spring.
An immense region one-fourth the size of the United States, Krasnoyarsk has some of the nation's largest factories along with Siberia-size economic problems. But Mr. Lebed assured the voters that the region need an experienced crisis manager, not an economist.
Certainly, Mr. Lebed has been sorely tested. With the collapse of the ruble, tax revenues plummeted. Panic buying cleared the shelves of baby food and cold medicine, leaving the region with dangerously small reserves.
Last week, residents in the city of Krasnoyarsk, the administrative capital of the region, found themselves without hot water when the authorities ran short of coal.
The only bright spot came when Mr. Lebed hosted a glitzy popular music festival, which was sponsored by one of Russia's leading television networks -- a brief distraction in what promises to be one of the toughest winters in years.
Chastened by his region's economic woes, Mr. Lebed no longer talks confidently about single-handedly turning the situation around. Krasnoyarsk, he says, needs a greater share of the nation's tax receipts and lower rail and electricity tariffs to thrive over the long term.
It is Mr. Lebed's short-term plan, however, that has led Krasnoyarsk's citizens to draw the political battle lines. Anxious to quell the economic turmoil sweeping the nation, Mr. Lebed has decreed controls on the price of meat, fish, bread, flour, cereal, pasta, beverages and coal.
The measures officially took effect a week ago when the order was published on the front page of the regional newspaper Krasnoyarsk Worker.
Under Mr. Lebed's system, producers who want to raise the wholesale price of goods need to appeal to a panel of government officials at least five days in advance. Officially, no ceiling on wholesale prices was set. But a Lebed aide has proclaimed that producers should be satisfied with a profit of 2 percent.
Retail prices are regulated according to a formula. Shop owners are not be allowed to sell their food and beverages for more than 10 percent more than what they paid for them. And Krasnoyarsk's tax inspectors are conducting spot checks to make sure.
Mr. Lebed has emerged in recent weeks as the most popular alternative to the Communists in the public opinion polls. But his brand of capitalism is both populist and exceedingly vague. "I am certainly on the verge of breaking the law, but I think my measures are justified," Mr. Lebed said earlier this month. "The emergency situation is compelling me to take emergency measures."
Defending his price controls, Mr. Lebed said they were needed to head off a wave of frenzied buying by consumers desperate to stock up before prices soared even further.
Another goal, he said, was to stop profiteering by local producers, who were taking advantage of the crisis to ratchet up their prices even though they have been somewhat insulated from the effects of Russia's falling currency. The aim, he insisted, was not to set the price of imported goods.
"Why should milk become more expensive? Has the price of cows gone up?" he said in an interview.
Mr. Lebed is not the only one to turn to price controls. Kaliningrad has declared a state of emergency. The tax police in Novgorod have prowled through the city, fining shops for exorbitant prices.
In the southern Russian city of Stavropol, fights broke out when consumers and merchants banded together against government inspectors, who they complained were interfering with local trade.
Even pricey Moscow has imposed a 20 percent limit on the markup for basic staples, though city officials insist it is more of a guideline than a law.
Still, Mr. Lebed's decree has been assailed by his critics, who say it shows his penchant for simplistic and authoritarian solutions to complex economic problems.
"This shows that no member of the Lebed team thinks in economic terms," said Aleksei M. Kleshko, a member of the Krasnoyarsk City Council."They only know how to deal with the crisis through administrative means."
To be sure, many local factory directors and shop owners are unhappy.
"The Government acts just like it did in the days of Soviet power, when business people were considered bourgeois speculators," said Yevgeniya Kuznetsova, the president of Pikra, a local beverage company and the first factory to be privatized in the Krasnoyarsk region.
After the ruble collapsed, the upgrading of the factory's beer production unit was stopped in mid-stream after a German factory refused to provide any more equipment on credit.
That has increased the factory's need for cash. Meanwhile, sales have fallen, as consumers have cut back on their purchase or beer and soft drinks so that they can stock up on flour, grain and cooking oil.
Ms. Kuznetsova said her company will be skating too close to the edge if it is restricted to a profit rate of 2 percent. Already, she has gone to a four-day work week to reduce costs.
"The government does not seem to worry about the collapse of small and medium business," she said bitterly.
At her small shop down the street from Pikra, Ms. Popova is more distressed than angry. A sturdy woman with an engaging manner, she voted for Mr. Lebed because of his promises to bring order to Krasnoyarsk.
Ms. Popova is already something of a survivor. She set up her food store in a working class district earlier this year after the investment company she was working for went bankrupt. Her store sells sausages, bread, alcohol and cooking oil. Saleswomen receive just 360 rubles a month (about $24 at current exchange rates) for their 12-hour-a-day jobs. Because the volume of sales is low and because her store also has to pay for utilities and an alarm system, Ms. Popova needs to mark up her goods by 20 percent just to break even, she said.
The Krasnoyarsk tax police, however, were not impressed by her arguments. After shuffling through the shop's balance sheets, they told her the store was exceeding the 10 percent mark-up allowed for salt, sugar and cereal. No fines were levied yet, but Ms. Popova was summoned to the local tax office to do some explaining.
"All summer long I told our saleswomen they should be patient and that I would increase their salaries a little bit in the fall," she said. "Now, I may have to fire some of them."
Still, Ms. Popova is reluctant to assign the blame to the gruff-talking Governor.
"I pinned hopes on him because I thought he would be tough," she recalled. "But he turned out to be too tough. He's not an economist, though, and this was probably done by his team. I still hope to prove to him that this is not right, and I might even vote for him again."

HEADLINE: About New York;
An 'Invisible' Life Remains So in Death

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
JOSE SORIANO loved walking around the city. It was a welcome stress-buster from his routine of working long shifts at a Brooklyn clothing factory. Some days he sauntered through Central Park to his railroad flat in El Barrio, taking in the sights of the city he adopted eight years ago when he moved here from Mexico. His wife, Fausta, worried about him, but he shrugged off her concerns. There's always light, he reassured her. And people look out, too.
"He always said: 'I would never leave New York. I love this city,' " his wife recalled. "He said he would only leave as a dead man." 
 In the next few days, Mr. Soriano will return to Mexico just that way. In a box. On Saturday night, as he was walking home through Central Park, he was stabbed to death near Belvedere Castle. He was 47 years old and leaves behind the family that had joined him in this country only four years ago.
As is the custom among the tightly knit extended families that cushion the hard life of Mexican immigrants in New York, friends and relatives bearing food and comfort have been trooping up the dark, narrow staircase of the Sorianos' tenement home on East 106th Street.
The rooms are nearly barren, mostly just beds, dressers and pictures of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The place is quiet, save for the sound of murmured adult conversation or the squeals of babies being carried by young women.
The silence extends to the rest of the city, too. Unlike other times when people have been beaten or killed in Central Park, there has been little outrage over Mr. Soriano's death. Contrast that with past attacks on the Jogger or the Piano Teacher, to name two vicious crimes in the city's great green backyard that infuriated the public and kept journalists busy for weeks.
Nor have there been visits from the Mayor or condolence calls from the Police Commissioner. Maybe the response would have been better had early reports not inaccurately called Mr. Soriano homeless, or if the Sorianos had been tourists or more upwardly mobile. But they are the kind of people whose countrymen do the kind of drudge work that keeps the local economy growing and humming for the benefit of the leisure class.
Basically, the reaction is as dead as Mr. Soriano. And the people around him know it.
"I think there is an obvious difference in how people are treated and how crimes are treated for people who live below 96th Street and people who live above 96th Street," said the Rev. Bruce Lewandowski, the associate pastor of St. Cecilia's Roman Catholic Church, the Sorianos' parish. "You have somebody here who is a so-called 'invisible person,' an immigrant who is most likely undocumented. They're invisible. They don't count."
So much so, that it took the authorities a day to realize that Mr. Soriano was not homeless. That description might have been true a few years ago, and only in the emotional sense, as he made the transition from Mexico to New York. He had come to the city to save some money and bring his wife and two sons up north, a goal he accomplished four years ago. His wife can still remember the exact date, July 29, 1994. A Friday.
"He had gone to Mexico and I told him I did not want to stay alone anymore," she said in Spanish. "For good or bad, I came with him. I didn't want to be separated anymore. I wanted to be by his side."
TRUE enough, they even worked together in a factory that made maternity clothing. It helped ease her transition to a new country, although she stopped working nearly three years ago when their daughter Grizelle was born. Mrs. Soriano's health was not good, so he told her to stay home while he put in six days a week at the Brooklyn factory for a few hundred dollars.
"He was paid by the piece," she said. "So when he could, he would want to continue working. He was one of those people who did not want to be at home. He would leave at 6 in the morning and come home at 10."
As difficult as such a meager existence was, the Sorianos found pride in being able to provide for their three children. They knew no other way.
"He always said it was hard here, but it was harder in Mexico," Mrs. Soriano said. "I never asked the government for help. We live to work."
Last Saturday he left work and went to a store to buy a pair of baseball cleats for a friend who played with him on a team in Red Hook. For the first time in their life together in New York, he never came home. Mrs. Soriano kept an all-night vigil.
"I sat," she said. "I stood. I looked out the window for him. But no."
The next day, she said detectives spoke to her husband's teammates in Brooklyn, and that's when word of his fate finally reached her.
"I think he wanted to come home walking through the park," Mrs. Soriano said. "And he found death along the way."
The police took her to the precinct station house, she said, then let her go after a while, promising to let her know when they had something to report. She said she has not heard anything since the police arrested a suspect in the case, only to drop the charges later.
"I heard the Mayor talking about the crime on the news," she said. "But nobody called from his office. Is it because we are Hispanic? Do they think we come here to take something from them? We only come to work. Or is it because we're poor?"
Mrs. Soriano does not have enough money to send his body back to Mexico. Friends and relatives are taking up a collection, but they are just as strapped as she. Yet they offer lessons in compassion.
"When something like this happens, we talk to each other and try to help with what we can," she said. "Maybe they cannot help with money, but they can help with moral support."
She will help, too, by returning to work in the coming weeks. Her husband's bosses said she was welcome to her old job.
"I want to push my children ahead," she said. "My husband is gone. He has to rest. The dead go to rest. The living are here to struggle to keep living."
She walked over to the window where she stood on Saturday night. In her hand was a picture of her husband, natty in a baseball uniform that had "Braves" emblazoned on the jersey.
"Mira," their daughter, Grizelle said, as she tugged at the picture. "Papi. Papi."
Outside, the streets were gray and damp. A few doors away from the Sorianos' building, a wall was decorated with a mural of St. Sebastian tied to a pillar, his nearly naked body pierced by arrows.
"We walk among each other in a deep dream," read an inscription, "committing small acts of violence among one another. The heart that awakens first will take us to the heavens from this earth."

HEADLINE: D'Amato Ad Seeks to Exploit Upstate Resentment of New York City

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Playing directly to upstate voters' longstanding antagonism toward New York City, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato began broadcasting a television advertisement yesterday asserting that his Democratic challenger, Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, had written off upstate New York with statements and votes throughout his career.
"Liberal Brooklyn Congressman Chuck Schumer doesn't think upstate New York matters," the announcer says over the bouncy sounds of lounge music, while the screen depicts a jagged saw cutting off the rest of New York State and leaving only downstate behind. The advertisement will air only north of New York City, Mr. D'Amato's aides said. 
 The advertisement reinforces the principal message spread by Mr. D'Amato, a Republican seeking a fourth term in Washington, during a two-day trip upstate on Sunday and Monday: that Mr. Schumer was hostile to the concerns of people who live north of New York City. To make the point, the advertisement pointed to statements and votes cast by Mr. Schumer, going back to 1977, on bills ranging from cutting dairy price supports to raising gas taxes.
"On Election Day, send Chuck Schumer a message: There's more to New York State than just Brooklyn," the announcer says.
Mr. Schumer's advisers attacked the advertisement as polarizing and politically out of bounds. "It is a desperate and misleading attempt at division from a candidate who is behind in the polls," said Howard L. Wolfson, Mr. Schumer's spokesman. "Chuck Schumer is a tax-cutting, crime-fighting Democrat and Al D'Amato just doesn't know how to react to that."
Mr. D'Amato's decision to air the stark advertisement -- and risk both alienating supporters in New York City and courting criticism that he is seeking to divide voters -- clearly signals the political weight he is attaching to upstate in this difficult re-election campaign. Mr. D'Amato's advisers, explaining the reasons behind the pointed attack, said that based on past elections, they expected 45 percent of the vote to come from upstate, compared with 30 percent in New York City and 25 percent from the suburbs.
In 1994, Gov. George E. Pataki also banked on upstate support to defeat Mario M. Cuomo, but avoided direct appeals to rivalries between the two parts of the state. In this campaign, Mr. Pataki, who is by all accounts in a strong position as he seeks a second term this year, has made a particularly vigorous appeal for support from downstate voters -- an appeal that Democrats said yesterday might be complicated by the emerging tactic of his fellow Republican.
In effect, Mr. Pataki and Mr. D'Amato are offering different political responses to what they each perceive as the same problem: that Republicans will be hurt this year by the struggling upstate economy. Mr. D'Amato is trying to push up his vote upstate, where he has historically been strong, while Mr. Pataki, who is looking for a large re-election victory to enhance his credentials as a national candidate, is looking to New York City for support.
In making the advertisement, Mr. D'Amato's advisers combed through Mr. Schumer's record in Congress and the State Assembly, seeking votes that served the interests of Mr. Schumer's constituents in Brooklyn but might not sit well with voters elsewhere in the state. For example, Mr. Schumer voted for two bills designed to curb payments to dairy farmers, to the benefit of milk drinkers. He also voted three times to increase the gas tax, another position that was not likely to offend the sentiment in his urban district.
Mr. D'Amato's advisers called the attack a fair case based on Mr. Schumer's record. "These are his quotes and his votes," said Kieran Mahoney, a senior political adviser to Mr. D'Amato. "And I think if anybody had some concerns about this, it would be the 40 percent of New Yorkers who live west of the Hudson River and north of the Tappan Zee Bridge."
However, Mr. Schumer's aides disputed one central element of Mr. D'Amato's advertisement -- its quotation of Mr. Schumer as saying, "To me, the West begins across the Hudson River."
Mr. Wolfson said the comment was taken out of context. And a transcript of the April 1997 press conference where Mr. Schumer made it suggests he was making a joke. Mr. Schumer mistakenly identified Senator Richard J. Durbin as being from Idaho. He is from Illinois.
"To you, I am from a Western state," Mr. Durbin said, according to Federal News Service, which transcribes news conferences in Washington.
The transcript describes Mr. Schumer as laughing, and then saying: "That's right. To me, the West begins across the Hudson River. In any case, we are glad to be here."
Mr. Mahoney defended the use of the quotation. "He said it," Mr. Mahoney said.
Mr. D'Amato's supporters did not offer any apologies for the tactics. Asked if they were playing to prejudice among upstaters against city residents, Edward I. Koch, the former Mayor who lost his 1982 bid for governor largely because of a poor showing upstate, let out a howl: "Absolutely!"
He called Mr. Schumer a typical New York City politician -- and he did not mean that as a compliment. The Congressman, Mr. Koch said, "takes credit for everything. He's a stereotype."
"Not all is fair in love and war," Mr. Koch said. "This is fair. It's not unfair to say that a candidate that comes from one section of the state might discriminate in favor of the section he comes from."
New York's voting history offers an explanation for Mr. D'Amato's tactics. In 1992, he defeated Robert Abrams, his Democratic opponent, by about 81,000 votes out of 7 million cast. Mr. Abrams won New York City by just over 460,000 votes, and Mr. D'Amato made up the difference by his showing in the suburbs and upstate.
And Mr. D'Amato, who was born in Brooklyn and made his name on Long Island, would appear to have little to lose in the county that he once called home. At last count, there were 133,913 registered Republicans in Kings County, compared with 846,512 Democrats.

SALES IN ASIA WILL BELOWER THAN EXPECTED, COMPAQ SAYS

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Compaq Computer Corporation said yesterday that sales of its personal computers in Asia would be lower than expected this year because of the region's economic crisis. The Houston-based company said that the number of computers it sells in Asia would be little changed from a year earlier and that overall sales for the region would fall short of earlier targets. It declined to disclose the targets or last year's sales. Compaq is cutting prices to shed its leftover models and is reining in costs at Digital Equipment, which it acquired in June for more than $9 billion. The shares rose 25 cents, to $31.875.

COOPER CAMERON WARNS ON EARNINGS AND PLANS LAYOFFS

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Cooper Cameron Corporation, a maker of oil and natural gas equipment, warned yesterday that earnings would fall below estimates in the third and fourth quarters and that the company would cut about 500 jobs as Asian economic troubles reduce sales. The Houston-based company said lower-than-expected sales would cut third-quarter earnings to about 70 cents a share, below the 84-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call Corporation. Cooper said fourth-quarter earnings would be about 75 cents a share, below the 93-cent estimate. To cut costs, Cooper will lay off 5 percent of its work force in the next 60 days and will close a production plant in Missouri City, Tex. The shares fell $5, to $29.25.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Uplifting Lessons in a Sweet, Tumbledown World

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
More than half a century after the full employment during World War II put an end to the Great Depression, that agonizing era is serving a new generation as a fount of wisdom: Hard times teach hard but useful lessons.
In films like "The Grass Harp" and today's arrival, "Shadrach," a generation raised in prosperity turns to a difficult past, suffuses it with a romantic glow and gazes with something like envy on its simple ways while tapping its people for insights into life's eternal verities, like death. 
 On more than one level, the slight, sweet, sentimental "Shadrach" is a labor of love by Susanna Styron, the film's director and co-writer, from an autobiographical tale by her father, William Styron, published in Esquire in 1978.
The events of "Shadrach," which unfold in the Tidewater country of Virginia in 1935, are seen through the eyes of 10-year-old Paul Whitehurst (Scott Terra), a clean-cut, well-brought-up only child of respectable parents whose best friend is Little Mole (Daniel Treat).
Little Mole is one of the Dabney clan, descendants of pre-Civil War tobacco plantation owners who have now plummeted to the category popularly known as white trash. The boys are unwashed, and the girls are slatternly, except for young Edmonia (Monica Bugajski), the apple of Paul's eye. Presiding over this brood are Trixie Dabney (Andie MacDowell), the beer-swilling, warmhearted mother (Deborah Hedwall) and Vernon Dabney (Harvey Keitel), the embittered, foulmouthed, unemployed sire who ekes out a living as a moonshiner.
For young Paul, life is about to become complicated. His mother is in the early stages of illness. His parents are called away to a distant family funeral, and the boy wins permission to spend a few days with the Dabneys. At the same time, a footsore old black man is making his weary way north from Alabama.
His name is Shadrach (John Franklin Sawyer), and when he reaches the Dabneys' littered yard after a 600-mile journey, he reveals that he is a 99-year-old former Dabney slave who has come back to die and asks to be buried on the grounds of the old plantation, where the Dabneys still maintain a tumbledown shack.
So Paul and the Dabneys and the incontinent Shadrach set out in Vernon's rickety car to fulfill the old man's wish, only to be told by the not unfriendly local sheriff that laws have changed, and it is now illegal to bury someone on private property.
Not only does the sheriff imply that he will shut down Vernon's still if he is disobeyed; he also puts Vernon in the position of having to come up with the near-impossible sum of $35 to pay for a funeral and burial in a cemetery.
As Shadrach sinks toward death and the Dabneys and Paul take turns tending the old man, the question hangs in the air: Will the Dabneys (Vernon, that is) honor their promise?
And for Paul, these few days foreshadow his mother's impending death.
While confronting life and death and growing up, Ms. Styron does not shy from dealing with segregation, with black and white children separated in a theater while watching a Stepin Fetchit comedy, and white men like Vernon using uninhibited language to designate blacks and President Franklin D. Roosevelt as the source of their woes.
At the same time, she evokes the simple decency of people who manage to retain their fundamental humanity in the face of hardship.
"Shadrach" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It contains foul language, racial epithets and profanity, the nude buttocks of happy children swinging over a swimming hole, a used condom and a dead body.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 25, 1998, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a film review of "Shadrach" on Wednesday misidentified the characters played by Andie MacDowell and Deborah Hedwall. It is Ms. MacDowell who plays "the beer-swilling, warmhearted mother," Trixie Dabney. Ms. Hedwall, whose character is referred to as Mother in the film, plays the mother of another character, 10-year-old Paul Whitehurst.

HEADLINE: What Will Mom and Dad Dream Up Next

BYLINE: By JACK KADDEN 

 BODY:
With cup holders sprouting in every corner and nook of American cars (there are seven in a Dodge Caravan), it was only a matter of time before someone came up with the Stroll'r Hold'r, an ingeniously simple cup holder that snaps on to the handle of a baby stroller.
 But that someone wasn't a marketing whiz at Sears or an engineer at Fisher-Price. It was Gail Frankel, a young Dallas mother who was a speech pathologist. 
 "I had two kids, one in a stroller and one walking by my side," she said. "I had lots of stuff and no place to put it."
 Most of the entrepreneurs who develop gear for the parents of babies are like Mrs. Frankel, clever amateurs trying to fill a need they have discovered while raising their own children.
 "Truly, this was not what I thought I would be doing with my life," Mrs. Frankel says now, 10 years after starting her company, Kel-Gar, which makes the Stroll'r Hold'r and dozens of other products meant to make parenting easier. Among them are the Snap 'n' Stroll, a fanny pack with pockets for a water bottle and a cellular phone, and the Clip 'n' Cool, a fan that attaches to a crib, a stroller or a playpen.
 Perhaps more than any other industry, the field of baby gear is very open to new products and companies. At the annual trade show sponsored by the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, as many as 100 of the 350 companies are first-time exhibitors, some beginner companies with only one or two products, said Bridget K. Reuter, an association spokeswoman.
 "Many of these companies," Ms. Reuter added, "are started by new parents home with new babies, finding a need and using their creativity to meet that need."
 Often, such companies offer their products by mail order, through catalogues or in specialy stores. But even the largest retailers are receptive and sell many of these items.
 Within a year after Mrs. Frankel began producing the Stroll'r Hold'r, Toys R Us agreed to sell it (it retails for $6), and her company was making a profit.

The Boppy
In 1989, Susan Matthews was working in advertising in Denver when she saw a sign in her daughter's day-care center asking parents to make pillows to prop up babies so they could see around them. That inspired the Boppy, a U-shaped pillow that sells for $20 to $30 and can also be used by mothers while nursing. In 1990, it won a best-new product award from the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, and it helped plant the seeds for Ms. Matthews's company, Camp Kazoo Limited, which now has 75 products.
 
Kikibarn
Kristine Kanefick is a 28-year-old artist who lives on a farm in River Falls, Wis., and has been concerned for a long time about farm animals in danger of extinction. She has translated that worry into a company, Kikibarn Arts for Biodiversity, which makes stuffed reproductions of endangered farm animals, like the American curly horse shown here. The animals sell for around $35, are sewn by women who live nearby and are made of organic cotton and wool from the endangered Navajo Churro sheep.
 
Smartsleep
Even with a Ph.D. in piano, Heide Brende was surprised by how quickly her newborn son, Carter, would calm down while listening to Bach. So she decided to make a recording of classical music called Smartsleep. Ms. Brende, who is 32 and lives in Pasadena, Calif., hired a concert hall in Texas and recorded herself playing classical selections on a Steinway to create "a concert-hall sound," she said. So far, she has sold about 1,500 CD's at $16 each, and 1,000 cassettes at $11, via mail order.
 
ABC
For years, Amy Shumway's Florida-based company, ABC Development, made novelty items like the foam reindeer antlers that are sold at parades, and housewares like scrub brushes. But when her first child was born six years ago, she entered a new field, juvenile products. "It's almost like products come out of necessity when you have a child," she said. Her first item for parents was the Bottle Scrubber, a wooden brush with a foam head that collapses to enter the bottle. It sells for about $2.50. The juvenile products industry, she says, is "very receptive to new ideas, and there are a lot of ways to get into it, through catalogues and mail order."

The Well-Fed Baby
For Robin Sweet, a former pediatric nurse, inspiration came in the form of a starving infant. She and her husband adopted a baby, Nicolai, in Russia, who at six months weighed a mere six pounds. "He was very malnourished," she said, "and when we brought him home, we knew we'd have to be careful what we fed him." Nicolai grew rapidly on a soy-based formula and progressed to homemade organic baby food, which brought about a cookbook called "The Well-Fed Baby." At readers' urging, she started a company by the same name to produce frozen Kosher organic baby food. The four different meals sell for just under $2 each.
 
Nurture Parenting Products
Christine Prefontaine, a 29-year-old mother, says she went into business last year making baby slings for one reason: "I couldn't find any funky baby stuff. Everything was pastels. I wanted to make stuff for my generation." Ms. Prefontaine soon added nursing dresses to her line to compete with the more conventional products on the market. "I wanted to provide an alternative that was fun and a little bit sexy. We kind of forget how we got pregnant in the first place." Her company, Nurture Parenting Products, now farms out the sewing to a contractor in Ms. Prefontaine's hometown of Arlington, Va.
 
Under the Canopy
Marci Zaroff didn't wait until she had children to become an entrepreneur. "I did my first business card when I was 11," she said. "I did calligraphy for weddings and invitations for special events. I was born a businesswoman." Now she runs a catalogue company called Under the Canopy, in Randolph, N.J., which sells more than 150 natural products, including children's clothing. Ms. Zaroff, who has two children and a degree in marketing, says that clothes made from natural fibers like hemp and organic cotton are "the wave of the future," adding: "This business is like natural foods was 10 years ago. What happened with natural foods, that's what's going to happen to ecofashion."
 
Hands-Free Baby Bottle
"You'd think that a mother would have come up with this idea," said Prudente Cueto, a former insurance agent who invented the Hands-Free Baby Bottle when his daughter was about six months old. Basically a baby bottle with a long plastic straw -- his invention -- that sells for $8, eliminates the need to retrieve bottles tossed out of car seats or high chairs. Mr. Cueto's company, Podee, based in San Diego, sells 100,000 bottles a year. He says it is particularly popular with mothers of twins and triplets.
 
Stroll'r Hold'r
With sales of more than 100,000 a year, the Stroll'r Hold'r continues to be one of the top items in the Kel-Gar company line. It sells for about $6. Gail Frankel, the company's founder, said the corporate name is a combination of her married name and her maiden name, Garfield. "The Gail Company sounded too cutesy," she said.

HEADLINE: For Indie Films, 1979's Lark Turns Into This Year's Institution

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
When Sandra Schulberg rented a screening room in Manhattan in 1979 to show 20 new films to producers and distributors, she felt as if she was doing something radical. "The intention was to try to create an alternate film economy," said Ms. Schulberg, a filmmaker herself. "I did not see it becoming an institution."
Nearly 20 years later, independent films have become a regular part of the cultural vocabulary, and the Independent Feature Film Market started by Ms. Schulberg has become an important early showcase for films like "My Dinner With Andre," "Welcome to the Dollhouse," "Roger and Me" and "The Brothers McMullen." 
 This year's market, which began on Friday and runs through this Friday, includes some 700 filmmakers and about 1,300 other people in the industry who come to make connections and find new talent. Films are shown at the Angelika Film Center, at 18 West Houston Street in Greenwich Village, and surrounding locations.
Filmmakers who want to show their work submit videotapes with a registration fee of $275 to $450, depending on the length of the film and the timing of the submission. This year, the number of projects on the market, including unproduced scripts, is roughly 400, said Michelle Byrd, the executive director of the Independent Feature Project, the country's largest membership organization for independent filmmakers, which administers the market.
Among the more talked-about projects this year, Ms. Byrd said, are "LaMastas," described at the market's on-line site (www.ifp.org) as a " 'Forrest Gump' meets 'Goodfellas,' " and "The Accident," a memoir filmed over 25 years. Ken Liotti said his film "The Waiting Game" is also one of the "hot" ones. "The buzz we've gotten is incredible," Mr. Liotti said. "All the festivals have approached us. Now we're on the map, which is the purpose of doing it."
Mr. Liotti, 40, said he wrote, directed and produced his 88-minute film -- about the misadventures of struggling actors who wait on tables -- after writing for Hollywood and never seeing his films produced. "I've been in development hell for 10 years," he said. "I wanted to see one of my movies up on the screen."
In addition to screenings, the market features several seminars every day, including "Who's Who in the Documentary World," "Coaching Screenwriters: Accessing Resources and Developing Strategies" and "How to Pitch to HBO Documentary Programming."
This year's market will reunite several alumni and a screening series at the Anthology Film Archives, on Second Street at Second Avenue in the East Village, to highlight 10 of the market's major previous films, including "Down by Law," "Daughters of the Dust" and "Stand and Deliver."
In addition, the market will present its second annual Gordon Parks Awards, which gives $10,000 to an African-American director and $10,000 to an African-American screenwriter. The Independent Feature Project says these awards helped increase the participation of black filmmakers in the market over the last two years from 16 in 1996 to 55 this year.

HEADLINE: Needed: A Fed for the World

BYLINE: By Jeffrey E. Garten; Jeffrey E. Garten is dean of the Yale School of Management and the author of "The Big Ten: The Big Emerging Markets and How They Will Change Our Lives."

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
Even as emerging markets sink into depression and stocks plunge from Montreal to Melbourne, a global economy is slowly emerging, albeit in a tortuous and painful way. But governments seem paralyzed, unable to deal with both the crisis and the opportunity.
Today's chaotic international market mirrors how the American economy evolved between the Civil War and the 1930's. For well over half a century we, too, had booms and busts, countless bank failures, rampant bankruptcies. Capitalism was an uncontrollable Darwinian process, with big winners and big losers. 
 But over time the United States set up crucial central institutions -- the Securities and Exchange Commission (1933), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (1934) and, most important, the Federal Reserve (1913). In so doing, America became a managed national economy. These organizations were created to make capitalism work, to prevent destructive business cycles and to moderate the harsh, invisible hand of Adam Smith.
This is what now must occur on a global scale. The world needs an institution that has a hand on the economic rudder when the seas become stormy. It needs a global central bank.
The sad fact is that we cannot rely on existing institutions or on national leaders for global economic stability.
The International Monetary Fund knows how to deal with one or a few countries at a time, but not an international phenomenon in which all countries' problems occur at once and are linked. The World Bank's mission has included financing big projects and alleviating poverty, but it is not designed for financial crises.
Simply trying to coordinate the world's powerful central banks -- the Fed and the new European Central Bank, for instance -- wouldn't work, either. If there is no inflation in the United States, the Fed won't lower interest rates simply because that would help, say, Southeast Asia. Such global responsibility is not in the Fed's charter. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, seems proud of its narrow focus on Europe. The result is inadequate attention to the three-quarters of the world consisting of emerging markets.
Effective collaboration among finance ministries and treasuries is also unlikely to materialize. These agencies are responsible to elected legislatures, and politics in the industrial countries is more preoccupied with internal events than with international stability.
An independent central bank with responsibility for maintaining global financial stability is the only way out. No one else can do what is needed: inject more money into the system to spur growth, reduce the sky-high debts of emerging markets, and oversee the operations of shaky financial institutions.
A global central bank could provide more money to the world economy when it is rapidly losing steam. For example, it could buy the bonds of the Central Bank of Brazil, thereby injecting hard currency into that country when it most needs the help (like right now). It would have the ability to buy a country's debt at steep discounts, a crucial need now because in countries like Thailand and Venezuela debts are piling up and preventing new lending and new investment. Ultimately a lot of this debt could be resold at a profit.
Such a bank would play an oversight role for banks and other financial institutions everywhere, providing some uniform standards for prudent lending in places like China and Mexico. The regulation need not be heavy-handed; providing clear and reasonably verified information to the market on the real state of banks around the world would be a leap forward. Investors could then make the informed judgments that they couldn't have made in, say, Russia or Indonesia.
None of these functions are being performed effectively now, and it will be impossible to have a world economy that doesn't resemble a reckless roller coaster unless they are.
There are two ways a global central bank could be financed. It could have lines of credit from all central banks, drawing on them in bad times and repaying when the markets turn up. Alternately -- and admittedly more difficult to carry out -- it could be financed by a very modest tariff on all trade, collected at the point of importation, or by a tax on certain global financial transactions.
One thing that would not be acceptable would be for the bank to be at the mercy of short-term-oriented legislatures. Witness how the United States Congress has consistently failed to provide new money for the I.M.F. even as the world economy slides toward deep recession.
A crucial political question is, To whom would a global central bank be accountable? It would have too much power to be governed only by technocrats, although it must be led by the best of them. One possibility would be to link the new bank to an enlarged Group of Seven -- perhaps a "G-15" that would include the G-7 plus rotating members like Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Poland, India, China and South Korea.
Another issue is the relationship between a global bank and the Fed. There would have to be very close collaboration. The global bank would not operate within the United States, and it would not be able to override the decisions of our central bank. But it could supply the missing international ingredient -- emergency financing for cash-starved emerging markets. It wouldn't affect American mortgage rates, but it could help the profitability of American multinational companies by creating a healthier global environment for their businesses.
It is never easy to create a new institution; too many people have vested interests in the status quo. Moreover, when these new structures are most needed, officials are preoccupied with managing the current crisis. When calm is restored, attention turns to something else. But the current global financial slide, with no one at the center to limit the damage, is evidence enough that there is a huge gap in the structures necessary to make globalization work.
As the eminent economic historian Charles Kindleberger said in examining the causes of the Depression, "For the world economy to be stabilized, there has to be a stabilizer, one stabilizer." He was commenting on the lack of leadership by America in the 1930's. Today, with the United States still showing no appetite for such a role, a global central bank could be an enormous help.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Dip, in Unusual Tandem With Wall Street

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of United States Treasury securities fell for the first time in five days yesterday despite weakness in stocks.
Analysts said investors might have been a little reluctant to buy at current prices with yield levels, which move inversely to prices, already at historic lows. 
 The 30-year bond's price fell 19/32, to 105 8/32. Its yield rose to 5.15 percent, from 5.12 percent Monday.
For most of the last two months the bond market has derived strength from the selloff in stocks, reflecting moves by investors around the world to the relative safety of Treasury securities. So it was considered unusual that both bonds and stocks fell yesterday.
Some analysts attributed the bond weakness to uncertainty over what the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee will do at its meeting next Tuesday. While speculation has increased that the Federal Open Market Committee may move to lower rates, which could help soothe anxiety in global markets, there is no obvious reason for reduced rates in the United States, where the economy is showing resilience.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said, "At the very least, the F.O.M.C. will adopt a bias toward easing at this meeting, but the probability of an actual easing at this juncture has increased markedly and may well be more likely."
Others were more emphatic in their prediction that the Fed would move to ease rates. Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist at the DKB Securities (USA) Corporation, said in his latest market report that the Fed would take such a step because of deepening distress in emerging markets, the threat of global deflation and some signs of slowing economic growth in the United States.
Additional insight into the economy's performance will emerge later this week when the Commerce Department releases a revision to the second-quarter gross domestic product number, along with August data for durable goods orders, personal income and consumer spending.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, whose ambiguous remarks about interest rates last week contributed to a large selloff in stocks, will be testifying today before the Senate Budget Committee.
Also today, the Treasury will sell $15 billion of new two-year notes, which by late yesterday were being offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 4.62 percent.

Rupert Murdoch; Prince Walid bin Talal, from Saudi Arabia, and Mediaset S.p.A. plan to buy as much as 25 percent of the Kirch Group, Germany's second-largest media company, for about $2 billion, the prince's adviser and Mediaset executives said.
As part of the plan, Kirch would be reorganized and would sell stock to the public early next year, the adviser, Tarak Ben Ammar, said in an interview today. Mr. Ben Ammar sits on the board of Mediaset, which is Italy's largest private broadcasting company and is controlled by the former Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi. 
 A spokesman for Kirch declined to comment.
A link with debt-laden Kirch would create Europe's biggest television alliance, straddling Italy, Germany, Spain and Britain.
The allied investors would be better able to compete against the major American networks in creating television series, films and shows. Mr. Murdoch, who controls extensive media holdings, and Mediaset would obtain a foothold in Germany's potentially lucrative market, which is Europe's largest, with more than 33 million households owning televisions.
"It's at the point where one can't think of doing anything in pay-TV in Germany without Kirch," Laurent Carozzi, a media analyst at Paribas in London, said. "They now have an opportunity to get in the market because of Kirch's financial weakness."
Analysts estimate the privately held German company has debts of 3 billion marks, or $1.8 billion. Kirch controls a digital television venture, DF1; 25 percent of a pay-television service, Premiere; a commercial channel, SAT1, and a sports channel.
Mediaset's chairman, Fedele Confalonieri, said the planned alliance would focus on commercial television financed by advertising, rather than on pay television.
Price Walid's role would be that of an investor, but the Murdoch-Kirch-Mediaset alliance could cooperate with ART, the Arab satellite television venture in which the prince's Kingdom Holdings company owns 30 percent, Mr. Ben Ammar said.
"How often do you find an important group like Kirch that wants to open up to friendly shareholders?" Mr. Ben Ammar said. "This is a great investment opportunity."
It is not clear how the Kirch stake would be distributed among the three partners and through which of his companies Mr. Murdoch would make the investment, Mr. Ben Ammar said.
Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation owns the Fox television network in the United States and controls British Sky Broadcasting P.L.C., Britain's biggest pay-television company. It also has television ventures in Asia.
The Asian economic crisis is prompting Mr. Murdoch to turn his attention to "fortress Europe," Mr. Ben Ammar said.
Mr. Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting is buying Manchester United P.L.C., Britain's richest soccer club, for about $1 billion. The Kirch alliance could allow him to tap Kirch's worldwide broadcasting rights for World Cup soccer and could strengthen his hand in negotiations to form a European "super league" of top soccer clubs like A. C. Milan, which is owned by Mr. Berlusconi.
Mediaset itself was listed on the Italian stock market in a similar transaction two years ago, with Mr. Berlusconi's Fininvest S.p.A. holding company selling part of its stake to Kirch, Prince Walid and others.

HEADLINE: Keeping Asia Liquid

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Preventing World Recession" (editorial, Sept. 17): With roughly 40 percent of the world in recession, it is imperative that the International Monetary Fund be provided with the $18 billion requested by the Clinton Administration. But I.M.F. financing is only a first step. 
 The Federal Reserve should also cut interest rates and loosen monetary policy. This would provide the liquidity without which Asia, Eastern Europe and South America would fail to stabilize. The flight of dollars from the developing world and depreciating local currencies have prevented affected economies from recovering their economic footing.
Making capital more available to them through lower interest rates and greater cash flow would help countries like those along the Pacific Rim grow their way out of recession. The economic deterioration that continues in much of the world must be stopped, and it is up to the United States to lead.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
The Dow Declines by 36.05 as Other Gauges Post Gains

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks were generally higher yesterday, but the market's most closely watched indicator, the Dow Jones industrial average, ended with a small loss.
The Dow fell 36.05 points, or five-tenths of 1 percent, to 7,897.20. Shares of companies whose profits are seen as vulnerable to slowing economies abroad were hit the hardest. Shares of Coca-Cola, which gets 66 percent of its net revenue from outside North America, accounted for nearly a third of the Dow's drop. 
 But shares of smaller companies and technology companies sent other market gauges sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite index, laden with many technology issues, closed up 17.37 points, or 1.03 percent, at 1,697.80. The Russell index of 2,000 smaller companies rose 5.60 points, or 1.54 percent, at 368.24.
Other market indexes rose. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 5.74, or 0.6 percent, to 1,029.63. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners by a 19-to-11 ratio on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Dow average's failure to keep up with the gains in the broad market "raises the question of a change in leadership" away from big companies, said Robert Streed, a money manager with the Northern Trust Company, which oversees $200 billion. Big stocks trounced smaller ones for the last three years, and if the rest of the market is catching up now it may signal that stocks reached bottom on Sept. 1, when the Dow fell to 7,400.30, he said.
In one sign of rising optimism, investors put cash in stock mutual funds this month after pulling out an estimated $5.4 billion in August. August was the first month since September 1990 that investors withdrew more cash from stock funds than they added, according to Trimtabs.com, which tracks fund flows. The redemptions occurred as the S.&.P 500 fell 15 percent and some international equity markets had even bigger losses.
Shares of airlines were higher, pushing the Dow Jones transportation average up 62.65, or 2.24 percent, at 2,865.29. AMR rose 1 5/16, to 65 9/16;Delta Air Lines climbed 2 15/16, to 103 15/16; Southwest Airlines gained 1 5/16, to 21 9/16.
A number of technology stocks were strong. America Online rose 3 3/4, to 106 1/8, while Yahoo Inc. gained 6 5/8, to 102 15/16. Microsoft was up 1 5/16, to 109 3/16; Compaq Computer rose 1/4, to 31 7/8, and Micron Electronics, ended up 9/16 at 14 9/16.
Drug makers led the gains in the S.& P. 500.
"Drug stocks are a safe place to hide, as they have a source of growth not dependent on the domestic economy or overseas" sales, said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer of New York-based New Amsterdam the Partners L.L.C, which oversees $652 million.
Schering-Plough rose 4 1/2, to 101 5/8; Pfizer gained 3 5/8, to 101 7/16, and Eli Lilly rose 3 9/16, to 79 7/8.
Gains were tempered by Coke and other companies that rely on overseas markets for a significant percentage of sales.
Jennifer F. Solomon, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, cut her 1998 and 1999 earnings estimate on Coke, and lowered her target price to $59 from $83 a share. Shares of Coca-Cola fell 2 15/16, to 56 1/4, and are down 36 percent from their July 14 high.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
U.S. Trade Official Says China Market Is Closed Tighter

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 22

 BODY:
A senior American trade official today criticized what he called China's unwillingness to open its markets to foreign companies, and accused the Chinese of tightening some restrictions on foreign businesses.
The remarks by the official, David L. Aaron, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, reflected what has become an increasingly tense trade relationship between Beijing and Washington. 
 Mr. Aaron said China's policies had helped produce a $1 billion-a-week trade deficit for Americans. He said the United States would look for new ways to press China into allowing improved access for American businesses to the nation's 1.2 billion people if the situation did not improve. "They have taken this relationship for granted," Mr. Aaron said, adding later, "The list of barriers is just getting bigger and we're not crossing anything off the list -- that's the problem."
Mr. Aaron, who was in Beijing to attend a conference and meet with Chinese officials, offered hope that the huge trading partners could ultimately cooperate. But the polite discussions on trade that surrounded President Clinton's visit here this spring have evidently given way to exasperation and blunt talk. Mr. Aaron characterized his meetings with the Chinese as "somewhat somber."
"We recognize that the Chinese have lots of difficult problems to face," Mr. Aaron told a small group of reporters, listing the broad Asian economic crisis, troubled state-owned enterprises and this summer's disastrous floods. "But my job is to make sure that on that list of problems is this trade deficit and the treatment of businesses here."
United States figures show the trade deficit with China exceeding $50 billion annually, and growing.
Mr. Aaron's admonitions came after a tense few weeks in which new American regulations banned imported goods from China packed in untreated wood crates or pallets, a ban that may well affect more than half of Chinese exports to the United States.
American officials say the new requirements are necessary to prevent further invasions by the Asian long-horned beetle, which in the last two years has emerged from Chinese raw-wood packing material to kill thousands of trees in New York and Chicago. But Chinese trade officials say the regulations were motivated not by bugs but by protectionism.
"The unilateral action taken by the United States could impact the normal development of Sino-American trade," China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said in a statement last week.
Although the United States has for years wanted Beijing to further open its markets, it had hoped China's stated desire to join the World Trade Organization would take care of the problem, since free markets are a condition of membership. But the Chinese Government has apparently accepted that it will not gain admission to the trade organization now, and the United States has been left to apply pressure on its own.
Today, Mr. Aaron said that barriers to American business in China seemed to be multiplying rather than shrinking.
He said, for example, that the authorities here had generally not let foreign companies develop a distribution network for their goods, and he complained of China's unwillingness to grant licenses to foreign companies in such service businesses as insurance. In the last few years, a number of American companies have established offices in Beijing, anticipating that such licenses would be approved.
Mr. Aaron also complained that the huge Chinese telecommunications market was mostly off limits to foreign companies and noted that the Government was contemplating banning the few foreign companies that had indirect investment in that industry.
China has created many more subtle barriers as well, Mr. Aaron said, such as increasingly cumbersome regulations on foreign currency transactions. He cited a resurgence in counterfeiting that was now so professional that copycat goods even carried fake Underwriters Laboratories seals.
"If W.T.O. isn't moving us toward market access and opening, we're going to have to find other methods," he said, adding that the Clinton Administration was now "looking at other options."
Officially, Mr. Aaron was in Beijing to attend a conference on Chinese energy needs and to talk to officials in preparation for the annual meeting of the Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade, a Chinese-American panel, in Washington next month. He said he was still optimistic that such joint forums could help resolve trade disputes, at least in some cases.
Chinese officials say the American trade deficit is not nearly as large as United States officials contend, maintaining that it is closer to $20 billion than $50 billion.

HEADLINE: 'New' Germans Find Escape From Tainted Past

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: HANOVER, Germany

 BODY:
They have grappled with their nation's history and understand its shame. They see their future with a self-confidence their parents lacked.
Germany's baby boomers have come of age, a new elite that has moved into the country's boardrooms and its barracks, worldly, drawn largely from the former West Germany, and above all striving for a sense of normality in a land whose elders felt anything but easy with themselves. 
 Opinion polls give no clear indication of this generation's likely voting patterns in national elections on Sept. 27, in which Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 68, is in the fight of his political life against Gerhard Schroder, 54.
But it is clear that no politician can afford to ignore this generation, a broad swath of the 60 million voters. For it will define the agenda in business, style, the arts and, increasingly, in politics as a dominant Germany faces a new era.
"There is an entire generation stretching from 35 to 50 that is running the country," Lieut. Col. Carsten Jacobson, 43, a general staff officer and former tank commander, said at his home near a lake south of Hanover. "It is the managers, the political leading class, the top civil servants."
It is a generation forged by two key dates: 1968, when a student revolt in Europe produced a broader sense of its power, and 1989, when the fall of the Berlin wall led to German reunification. It is also a generation that has molded American thinking about how Germany will brace for a new century -- aware of its own interests and ready to pursue them, and to assume greater responsibility within the European and Atlantic alliances.
"The question is whether they have overcome their fear of being German, and the answer is: Yes," said J. D. Bindenagel, a senior United States State Department official with long experience in Germany.
German companies are major players in the economies of the victorious wartime Allies. German soldiers, once barred from service outside their country, now patrol the Balkans. When Europeans seek a lead in dealing with the Russian crisis, they turn reflexively to Bonn. And much of Europe's ability to make its single currency work will demand German leadership.
 
The Divide
Nazis Shaped the West, Communists the East
As with much of Germany's modern visage, it is a generation with two profiles: west and east.
Many westerners were born of parents who experienced Nazi Germany first hand, yet frequently lived in denial of complicity as they rebuilt their country into Europe's richest. Yet all were nurtured by the peace, prosperity and self-confidence of the German economic miracle.
In the former East Germany, the dynamic was different: a Communist leadership denied not just responsibility for the Nazi era, but also the individual initiative encouraged in the west -- creating divisions that linger today. But what differentiates Germany's baby boomers from their American counterparts is the legacy of the past.
German success, like American success, is measured in snappy suits and slick cars, exclusive vacations and rich homes. But where the American collective memory unfolded from victory in World War II, many Germans of an earlier generation emerged with the crushing, guilt-laden burden of the Holocaust and defeat.
By contrast, the new Germans are bolstered by a consensus that while Germans of their age must prevent history from repeating itself, time has distanced them from their forebears' guilt. They are far readier to assert their interests, sometimes as Germans, sometimes more as Europeans, in a contradictory world where globalization has heightened national competition, just as the conflicts of the post-cold-war era in places like Bosnia and Albania demand cooperation.
 
The Soldier
From Years of Isolation To a Global Role
Throughout the cold war, the soldiers of the former West Germany were forbidden -- by the Constitution and often by inclination -- from venturing outside the huge land mass patrolled by NATO. When the cold war ended, many Germans, including those in the military, still resisted American insistence that reunification brought new responsibilities in policing an unruly world.
Colonel Jacobson was not one of them. "We are a country at the crossroads of European history," he said. "We border nine countries. We are 80 million people. We are a wealthy country and a magnet to neighbors who are not as wealthy. It's generally felt that we have a moral burden. But I don't think we have any alternative but to take an active role."
Inevitably, though, the emergence of that role took Germany back to its past and, specifically, to its history in the Balkans, where Hitler's armies sustained a fascist regime in Croatia. From 1945 to the mid-1990's, when a German medical unit cautiously deployed to Croatia, followed by the dispatch of combat troops to Bosnia, the Balkans represented a taboo.
"It would be stupid as a German soldier to go to the Balkans without knowing what happened there," Colonel Jacobson said. "And since everything in the Balkans is history, there is no nice gesture to get around that."
So in late 1997, Colonel Jacobson set off for Sarajevo for what became a seven-month stint as military assistant to a German two-star general serving under American command of the international peace force in Bosnia.
It went "remarkably well," he said. Despite historical mistrust, there were no personal affronts. Indeed, he said, he discovered that working 24 hours a day with other soldiers in the multinational force, some from countries that had been invaded by Nazi Germany, "Germans were not looked at differently."
"We have found our way back to the choir of nations as soldiers," Colonel Jacobson said.
 
The Banker
U.S. Business Ties Blur Distinctions
Along that route, of course, the United States was a mentor. But here too, for a newer generation, attitudes toward America have become more textured as Germans have moved away from being perceived as Teutonic stereotypes.
"I don't feel very German in Britain or the United States," said Gabriele Eick, 46, the head of communications at Dresdner Bank. "I feel very much at home. I would be embarrassed if people thought: the typical German."
Ms. Eick's resume could almost be that of an American high flier, reflecting a career that for many years unfolded within German subsidiaries of big American corporations like IBM, A. C. Nielsen and Burson-Marsteller.
Now, though, Ms. Eick's career has brought her into a different and potentially more combative relationship with an important part of American society: part of her job is to mold the corporate response to a class-action suit by Holocaust survivors who say Dresdner and other banks profited from their suffering.
Ms. Eick was born in the former East Germany in 1952 and her family fled to the west just a few months before the Berlin wall was built in 1961.
"My generation grew up on American folk songs," she said. "I know more American folk songs than German ones. And this is how I learned a large part of my English. I grew up with a very strong, positive American orientation."
Sentiments like these are much different from those of people like Chancellor Kohl, whose teen-age years unfolded under the occupation of French and American forces.
Indeed, as Hermann Grohe, a 37-year-old member of Parliament in Bonn put it: "I meet American legislators with the feeling that these are representatives of the people in the most important democracy in the world. But I don't see them as 'the victor.' "
Nowhere has that been more evident than in the world of business. German publishing houses have taken huge stakes in American publishing. Volkswagen owns auto plants from the Czech Republic to Spain. Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler. SAP, a German software company, is the fourth largest in the American-dominated hi-tech world. BMW owns the Rover car company in Britain and has agreed with Volkswagen to parcel out ownership of Rolls Royce and Bentley.
 
The State Official
New Economic Gains Don't Yet Close Divide
The acquisitive drive was forced on German business by a changing world. The European single market and the prospect of a European single currency obliged companies to think in terms of far wider networks, while the broader dynamics of the auto industry led the drive for economies of scale as a means of survival in the global competition. And that, in turn, revolutionized German big business, creating the readiness not just to advance into global markets, but also to challenge Germany's stultified labor practices.
One of the key players in this transformation was Helmut Panke, 52, BMW's industrial relations director, who set up the company's operation in Spartanburg, S.C., between 1993 and 1995.
"Foreigners change because they see a different Germany," he said. "But Germany and the Germans changed because they have experienced more of the global network."
Of course that view came from the west, and Matthias Platzeck, 44, the environment minister of Brandenburg, in the east, sees things differently.
Mr. Platzeck was 7 when the Berlin wall was built, sealing him into a cocoon of social protection, outright repression and Soviet domination.
"If you learned a second language, it was Russian or Polish," Mr. Platzeck said. And even now, the sophistication of western Germans does not extend so easily to the easterners. "The ability to jump across the pond is a western thing," he said.
It was a world, he said, that treated the Holocaust as "a side issue" and tried to teach its children to glorify the Soviet Union. And it has left a different legacy.
In eastern Germany, unemployment is twice as high as in the west, at 20 percent, and it afflicts mainly the 50-plus generation, the group that in the west gained most from the economic miracle. The causes for the easterners' joblessness are well known: reunification brought a wave of Deutschmark capitalism, utterly destroying industries that had offered artificial full employment.
But, Mr. Platzeck said, that same shock wave may have galvanized a younger generation, forcing members into service industries, the media and other sectors. "Unlike in the west, 80 percent of professional people in eastern Germany who do have jobs have changed their jobs in the past seven years," he said. "Big changes are on the way with the European single currency. And easterners are better armed for that."
 
The Election
A Real-World Measure Of the Generation Gap
The generational shifts evoke the real subtext driving Germany's election: How will this new generation propel Europe's economic powerhouse toward the challenges of the European unity?
Mr. Kohl's Social Democratic opponent, Mr. Schroder, is 14 years younger than the Christian Democratic Chancellor and likes to call himself a Spatgeborene, a word that means "born late" and denotes those whose birth came late enough to avoid all taint of the Third Reich.
While Mr. Schroder is narrowly ahead in opinion surveys, though, his personal popularity is equaled by a Christian Democrat of his generation, Wolfgang Schauble, Chancellor Kohl's heir apparent. And many believe that if he won, Mr. Kohl would soon hand over to Mr. Schauble. In other words, whatever the outcome on Sept. 27, this is likely to be Mr. Kohl's last election before he bows out.
Mr. Schroder's choice as economics minister is Jost Stollmann, 43, an iconoclastic computer millionaire who has angered the Social Democratic party traditionalists by rejecting their left-wing economic platform.
"Germany's future," Mr. Stollmann declared recently, "is neither left nor right, not ideological but pragmatic. It will be a different way, our own German way."

HEADLINE: Midwest Farmers Running Out of Options in Protest on Imports

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BISMARCK, N.D., Sept. 22

 BODY:
Farmers and ranchers who blockaded Canadian border crossings on Monday to keep farm products out of the country may have few options besides seeking a grain-dumping action by the Federal Government with the International Trade Commission.
Hundreds of farmers and ranchers blockaded Canadian border crossings and stopped a Canadian Pacific train for about 20 minutes near Portal, N.D., by putting a tractor on the tracks. 
 One Montana farmer, Hank Zell of Shelby, said: "These little towns are drying up. Farmers don't have any money."
Frustration with trade policies has intensified so much that North and South Dakota officials began pulling over Canadian trucks last week under tougher inspection programs for wheat and livestock.
"Our market just keeps slipping away from us," said the blockade organizer, Ron Jensen of Sweetgrass. "We just can't afford to produce a bushel of grain for $2. The Federal Government says it costs us $5.54 to produce it."
The farmers have had this argument before.
From June 1993 to May 1994, Canada shipped nearly 91 million bushels of wheat south. Under pressure from farmers and farm-state lawmakers, the United States adopted limits that year on the amount of wheat Canada could export to the United States without paying tariffs.
But those quotas -- which allowed Canada to ship only 55 million bushels of wheat annually before tariffs were imposed -- were lifted a year later, and grain shipments from Canada have increased to 73.2 million bushels in the last year.
The law used to impose the tariffs was abolished during negotiations in 1995 under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said Neal Fisher, administrator of the North Dakota Wheat Commission.
Now, the most talked-about and perhaps only option for the farmers is to get the Federal Government to bring a case against Canada before the International Trade Commission accusing the country of dumping grain at below-cost prices.
To do this, the Government would need to know the prices set by the Canadian Wheat Board, which exports all wheat grown in western Canada. But efforts by Congress's General Accounting Office to audit the board have failed.
Not everyone blames the Canadians. Ford Runge, an economics and law professor at the University of Minnesota, said Canadian grain imports might have some modest regional impact on prices, but in the main, farm prices are set by larger forces of supply and demand.
"This is just a reflection of farmers' frustration with low prices and a series of bad years," he said.
Canadian officials contend that they are simply meeting customer demand and are not dumping wheat on the American market.
"It's customer satisfaction we're capitalizing on now in the U.S.," said Jim Pietryk, a spokesman for the wheat board. "Our durum, the last couple of years, has been disease-free."
A North Dakota State University study last year found that durum and barley producers in the upper Midwest had lost nearly $270 million in income in three years because of Canadian grain dumping. Processors said they were forced to buy Canadian grain because of disease-plagued domestic crops.
American farmers dispute this, saying there is plenty of good grain south of the border.
Another problem for farmers is that United States trade officials tabulate wheat import figures on a nationwide basis. Mr. Fisher said that meant the impact of Canadian imports on farmers in the upper Midwest was not adequately measured.
A spokesman in the office of the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, who spoke on the condition he not be identified, pointed out that the United States exported 28 times as much wheat each year as it imported from Canada -- making it hard for farmers to make a case that the market has been disrupted.
The Asian currency crisis has made the situation worse by depressing demand from abroad. That and high-yield harvests at home have resulted in overflowing storage elevators, particularly in the Northwest.
Some farmers have little hope in Government intervention.
Larry Neubauer of Sweetgrass, Mont., said he had had it with trade officials.
"The peaceful ways, the talking ways, the diplomatic ways, have basically been exhausted," Mr. Neubauer said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Is Seeking More Money for Military Readiness

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
A week after the nation's military commanders warned him about growing fiscal strains on the armed services, President Clinton today proposed giving the Pentagon an immediate new infusion of cash and opened the door to a much larger increase in military spending in 2000.
In a letter to Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, Mr. Clinton said he would take "additional steps" to plug a series of shortfalls already envisioned in the Pentagon's $270 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. 
 Those shortfalls, which commanders told the President were eroding their readiness to fight and win the next war, have led to shortages of spare parts for warplanes, cuts in training and difficulties in recruiting and keeping qualified troops.
Mr. Clinton specifically pledged to address each of those readiness problems and promised to avoid similar problems in the 2000 budget that the Office of Management and Budget will propose early next year.
"I commit to you that then men and women of our armed forces will have the resources that they need to do their jobs," Mr. Clinton said in the letter, which Pentagon officials made available on the condition that they not be identified.
The letter did not mention specific figures, but officials at the Pentagon said the Clinton Administration would immediately propose adding $1 billion to the $4 billion emergency supplement already proposed for the coming budget.
For the next budget, the President's commitment is less clear. A spokesman at the White House said Mr. Clinton had yet to commit himself to increasing the overall military budget for 2000, which is set to grow slightly to $276 billion
But an Administration official said Mr. Clinton -- implicitly in the letter and explicitly in conversations with senior officials at the Pentagon -- had indicated his support for the first significant increase in military spending since he took office.
How significant remains to be worked out. The Pentagon's budget makers have yet to come up with a figure, but analysts have estimated that an increase could fall between $10 billion and $20 billion, for an increase of 3.5 percent to 7 percent.
The President's pledges came only a week before the Joint Chiefs of Staff, led by Gen. Henry H. Shelton, is to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee at a special hearing on problems with the military's readiness. The pledges will give the chiefs something to use to respond to Republicans who have become increasingly critical of the Administration's military spending, accusing Mr. Clinton of letting the armed forces weaken.
At their meeting with Mr. Clinton at the National Defense University last week, the Joint Chiefs and the unified combat commanders warned that the increasing duties at home and aboard placed heavy strains on the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps at a time when budgets have more or less stayed level with inflation.
The readiness strains have led to a series of problems, Pentagon officials say, from shortages of spare parts to a growing gap between civilian and military pay that many in the Pentagon believe is forcing the most qualified troops to leave.
In today's letter, Mr. Clinton wrote, "Readiness is a perishable commodity and requires our serious attention."
Mr. Cohen and General Shelton have tried to highlight the shortfalls in recent months, laying the groundwork for a plea for additional money. The issue has become more urgent, they have said, because Congress has refused for two years to agree to close more unneeded military bases, a step that could save $20 billion over the next decade.
Republican aides in the House and the Senate said today that they were unaware of the President's letter, though they indicated that any increase in defense spending was likely to receive broad support. Already there have been bipartisan calls to increase the Pentagon's budget for everything from new weapons programs to improvements in the quality of life.
It was unclear how the Administration would pay for any increase in military spending. Another Administration official said the $1 billion increase in the immediate future would most likely be obtained through cuts elsewhere in the Federal budget.
As for future budgets, Mr. Clinton has pledged not to spend any surpluses until the White House and Congress agree on how to preserve the Social Security system.
Without the surplus, the balanced-budget agreement would force the Administration to cut spending elsewhere to pay for any significant increase for the Pentagon, a move that could lead to fights within the Administration and the Democrat Party over priorities.
The agreement, which has been overtaken by the booming economy, capped Pentagon spending at about $270 billion this year, but the caps come off next year.
The Council for a Livable World Education Fund, an advocacy group in Washington, said in a statement today that Congress was using "anecdotal evidence" of readiness problems to justify pork-barrel increases in weapons systems in their home states. The council added, "Congress is more interested in preserving local jobs than helping to solve any readiness problems."

Nomura to Double Capital of U.S. Unit

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 22

 BODY:
The Nomura Securities Company said today that it would inject $380 million of capital into its American unit, Nomura Holding America Inc., this month to increase its financial strength.
Nomura, Japan's biggest brokerage firm, said the decision to almost double the unit's capital came in response to a deteriorating market environment, partly a result of economic turmoil in Asia and Russia. 
 Earlier this month, Nomura said its American and British units had combined losses of $350 million on their holdings of Russian Government bonds at the end of August, after Russia's slide into financial crisis.
In addition, there have been unconfirmed reports that Capital America, a San Francisco-based unit of Nomura Holdings that specializes in repackaging commercial real estate loans for sale to investors, lost about $200 million on loans. The business's founder and vice chairman, Ethan Penner, resigned last week to start his own company. Mr. Penner, 37, had unusually strong control of its venturesome lending policies.
Widespread concern that a worsening in emerging markets was hurting Nomura's profitability helped briefly drag down the brokerage firm's stock price today below 1,000 yen for the first time since November 1985. Its shares finished 16 yen lower at 1,030 yen, or $7.60.
After the news of Nomura's Russian losses, leading credit-rating agencies placed Nomura under review for possible downgrading.

HEADLINE: Rising Costs in Health Care

 BODY:
A report by economists at the Department of Health and Human Services predicts that growth in health-care spending will increase substantially over the next 10 years. Total health expenditures are expected to rise from $1 trillion in 1996 to $2.1 trillion by 2007, jumping from 13.6 percent of gross domestic product to 16.6 percent. That is likely to translate into much higher health insurance premium increases than has been the case in recent years. These numbers are discouraging, particularly since the projections do not even reach the years when baby boomers will begin utilizing health care intensively in their late 60's and 70's.
The relatively low growth in spending of the past four years is actually an aberration from long-term trends, made possible by a rapid shift of American workers into managed-care plans from costly fee-for-service plans where there were few constraints on what doctors and hospitals could charge or patients could request. Many economists have said for some time, however, that this tamping down of costs is a one-time effect achieved mostly by getting price discounts out of hospital systems and squeezing down doctors' fees. 
 The long-term ability of managed care to control escalating costs is likely to be more modest. Although it can help by subjecting doctors' decisions to review and emphasizing preventive care, managed care has not been able to resist consumer demands for expensive technological procedures, a big driver of health spending. Changing practice standards and new and more expensive drugs will continue to push up spending even after managed care squeezes the easy-to-attack inefficiencies out of the health delivery system. The growth of point-of-service plans where enrollees have greater choice of doctors may further weaken managed care's ability to control costs.
This country already spends more on health care as a share of gross domestic product than any other nation, yet 41 million Americans have no health coverage at all. The shift toward managed care has produced a few good years of relatively stable costs. But it has not reduced the problem of the uninsured. With costs starting to accelerate again, the hope that managed care could extract enough savings out of the system to cover millions of uninsured Americans seems less and less likely.

HEADLINE: Quarter Profit At Goldman Declines 25%

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

 BODY:
Goldman, Sachs & Company said yesterday that it earned $754 million before taxes in its fiscal third quarter, a drop of about one-fourth from the second quarter, as global market turmoil took a toll on profit and cast doubts on Goldman's own planned public offering of stock.
Executives acknowledged yesterday that they were debating whether to delay the private partnership's much-anticipated initial public offering, a decision some market analysts look to as a statement on the stock market's health. If the firm were to delay the offering, it would suggest that some of America's most successful investment bankers considered it unlikely that financial markets would significantly recover before year's end. 
 The firm's six-man executive committee does not have to decide whether to proceed with the offering until early next month, said the executives, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified. It is still scheduled for November. But top company officials are at least considering the prospect of delaying until 1999, especially since the firm expects its earnings slide to continue through the fourth quarter.
"You can't go public if you can't deliver the quarter," a Goldman executive said. "And you can't fight the tape," he said, alluding to the falling stock prices of financial company rivals.
Conditions in financial markets and the stock prices of Goldman competitors have deteriorated sharply since June, when the 189 partners voted to take the firm public. Goldman's two main peers, Merrill Lynch & Company and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, have both seen their stock prices plunge by about half from their peaks in July. They had been trading at high levels in relation to earnings on hopes that profit would continue to grow quickly, but the reverse is turning out to be the case.
The Goldman, Sachs earnings decline is indicative of a broader Wall Street trend, as Goldman is the first of the big securities firms to report results. Many financial companies have suffered losses in emerging markets since August. But the bigger worry now is the health of bond markets in advanced economies, a far more important source of profit. Russia's decisions to devalue its currency and to default on some domestic debt have wreaked havoc with prices of debt securities, and the turmoil shows little sign of easing.
John A. Thain, Goldman's chief financial officer, said in a statement that the firm's earnings in some areas, including mergers and acquisitions advising and asset management, remained robust through the third quarter, which for Goldman means the months of June, July and August. But trading and underwriting of new equity and debt issues took a hit, he said, and the slowdown has continued in September.
"Increased volatility in the financial markets, the widening of credit spreads, a decline in liquidity in certain markets and a reduction in global equity values have adversely affected many participants in the financial services sector," Mr. Thain said. "We expect these conditions to negatively impact our fourth-quarter results."
Though Goldman's third-quarter earnings were 25 percent less than in the second quarter and about 20 percent less than the quarter a year earlier, results for the year to date remain strong.
For the first nine months of the 1998 fiscal year, the firm reported pretax earnings of $2.814 billion, compared with $2.447 billion for the corresponding period of 1997. Net revenue for the first nine months was $7.605 billion and expenses were $4.791 billion. Goldman reports only pretax earnings as the individual partners settle their own taxes.
The earnings drop is roughly in line with expectations, said Raphael Soifer, securities industry analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. But because June and July were relatively strong months, the 25 percent slump in earnings for the quarter implies a bad August, he said. And with the slump continuing into September, the stars are not well aligned for a big Goldman initial public offering.
"One wonders how one can bring a big I.P.O. into a market this volatile," Mr. Soifer said.
Two other securities companies, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers, will also report results this week. Analysts are expecting Morgan Stanley to show a similar 25 percent drop in earnings compared with the second quarter. Lehman Brothers, whose profit depends more on trading and the bond market than do Morgan's or Goldman's, is expected to sustain even sharper damage, with operating earnings falling by about half from the second-quarter level.
Virtually all other brokerage firms and big international banks are expected to report falling quarterly profit, and in some cases, losses.
Wall Street is usually quick to react to changes in market conditions, and many expect companies to begin laying off workers in coming weeks. Merrill Lynch and Bankers Trust have already warned that layoffs are possible.
Guy Moszkowski, who analyzes the securities industry for Salomon Smith Barney, said that with no quick turnaround for financial markets in sight, banks and brokerage firms would look for ways to save money.
"They will look to cut as much fat as they can as soon as they can," he said. But Mr. Moszkowski added that some Wall Street houses overreacted to the 1994 market downturn and dismissed too many people, making them ill prepared to profit when markets recovered. "The lesson from 1994, I think, is that they shouldn't be too quick to cut muscle."

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Philippine Airlines may shut down operations tonight, a victim of the Asian economic crisis.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell

 BODY:
BARRING a last-minute rescue, Philippine Airlines, Asia's oldest scheduled carrier, will shut down at midnight tonight. This means passengers who until now have flown the airline's daily nonstop flight between Los Angeles and Manila, or the thrice-weekly nonstop flights between San Francisco and Manila, will have to make other arrangements. But no other arrangements from the United States will include nonstops.
Northwest Airlines, for example, has daily flights to Manila from nine United States cities, including New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. But all of them connect through Tokyo, which after a layover of about two hours requires a change of plane and an additional four and a half hours of flying. Northwest's daily flight from Memphis to Manila via Tokyo also requires a stop and a change of plane in Seattle. 
 UAL's United Airlines flew nonstop between San Francisco and Manila until Feb. 20, when it finally pulled the plug on that unprofitable route. Now United's Manila-bound passengers have to fly to Tokyo and connect with another airline -- as do those of AMR's American Airlines and Delta Air Lines. Continental Airlines' passengers can fly nonstop to Honolulu from Newark, Houston and Los Angeles, then connect on Continental Micronesia to Manila after a stop in Guam.
Philippine Airlines has been hurt by a series of strikes, by the Asian financial crisis and by overly ambitious expansion plans that have saddled the carrier with $2 billion in debt. "Demand in Asia has just dried up, and several airlines there are verging on bankruptcy," said Michael Boult, director of supplier relations for Rosenbluth International, the large business travel management company.
Rosenbluth and other travel management companies almost never book clients on struggling airlines, lest they fail and leave passengers stranded. But they have no problem booking with Singapore Airlines, Qantas Airways, Air New Zealand, ANA, Cathay Pacific or Japan Airlines. Moreover, Mr. Boult said that the fire-sale fares offered by many Asian carriers, in an effort to keep afloat, had led to "aggressive corporate discounting" of as much as 25 percent -- even by United States and European carriers -- for fares to Asia.
"I think 1999 will still be rough going for the weaker Asian carriers," Mr. Boult said. "But there's no doubt in my mind that the Asian market will rebound in the year 2000," although not necessarily with all the current airlines intact.
 
Prices on the Rise
Business travelers should prepare themselves for another year of heavy passenger loads on airlines and high occupancies in business hotels. And, of course, higher prices for both. A preliminary study by American Express, released yesterday, projects an overall increase of 5 to 6 percent for the cost of business travel next year.
The price increases will again be led by air fares, which will rise an expected 4 to 5 percent, and for hotel rooms, which will go up 7 to 10 percent in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and the 22 other top business destinations,
The forecast numbers, based on data from American Express and other industry sources, could change if current economic turmoil overseas and stock market instability in the United States translate into lower demand for business travel. As of now, though, the company said, it is advising companies "to brace for another tough year with few travel bargains."
 
A Really Tall Ship
That behemoth looming over the New York skyline from Pier 88 beginning tomorrow will be neither an apparition nor something out of a Japanese science fiction film. Instead, it will be the 109,000-ton, 18-deck, $450 million Grand Princess, the world's most expensive and biggest passenger ship -- taller than either Niagara Falls or the Statue of Liberty.
Launched last May, the ship -- owned by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company -- cruised the Mediterranean until Sept. 11, before heading to Manhattan. The actress Olivia de Havilland will formally christen the ship next Tuesday at 10:30 A.M.; the first marriage in the ship's wedding chapel will be performed this Friday at 10 A.M. Beginning Oct. 4, the ship -- 53 feet too wide to get through the Panama Canal -- will begin almost eight months of seven-day Caribbean cruises from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Obuchi Break Ice but Solve No Economic Problems

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
President Clinton and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan met for the first time yesterday and struggled to reassure the markets that they agree on a common strategy to pull the world's second-largest economy out of a recession that is fueling economic turmoil on three continents.
But after nearly three hours of meetings in New York, the two leaders emerged with no agreement about what Japan will do about the trillion dollars in bad debts that have acted like an anchor on the world economy. 
 Their chief areas of agreement, aides said, were a shared concern about North Korea, a decision to meet again early next year and the politically mandatory promise to call each other by their first names.
While trying to sound upbeat, American officials acknowledge that they emerged from the meeting with no better sense of how Mr. Obuchi planned to resolve a politically paralyzing debate over the bank debt that is already threatening the Prime Minister's loose grasp on power.
The bad bank debts now overshadow trade disputes and growing security concerns in the Pacific as the No. 1 issue between the two countries. The tower of debt has frozen economic activity, forced Japan to keep insolvent banks afloat and set off waves of turmoil far beyond Japan's own shores.
In a brief and carefully stage-managed appearance with Mr. Obuchi, President Clinton acknowledged that an "immensely complicated political situation" in Japan limited the Prime Minister's options.
Indeed, the divisions among the political parties in Japan are so complex that Mr. Obuchi was unable to address Mr. Clinton's main concern: Tokyo's vow to use tens of billions of dollars in public funds to prop up some of the world's largest banks.
As the two men met, a political deal to merge or nationalize the virtually insolvent Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, a huge financial institution, appeared to be unraveling in Tokyo.
"The Prime Minister made it clear that they were working very hard on this legislation, that there are a lot of moving pieces, and he did not make a commitment," Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said yesterday afternoon.
Meetings with American presidents are always important for Japanese prime ministers. No matter what the subject of the session, it is critical for a new Japanese leader to demonstrate that he can hold his own with an American president and fend off, when necessary, the incessantly demanding Americans.
To bolster the Prime Minster, the White House planned to fly the two leaders to the Rockefeller estate in Tarrytown, where they could hold their meeting in a bucolic setting. But fog kept their helicopters grounded, and the meeting was held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Park Avenue.
What made this meeting unusual was that it was also important for Mr. Clinton, at several levels. Without resolving Japan's problems, Mr. Clinton's hopes of calming the world financial turmoil -- a task he committed himself to in a speech last week at the Council on Foreign Relations -- would be greatly impaired, if not doomed.
More immediately, the session was the latest opportunity for Mr. Clinton to demonstrate that he is focusing on substantive issues despite the continuing jockeying in Washington over impeachment proceedings or a possible censure.
Mr. Clinton insisted to reporters at one point yesterday that he had ignored the televised deluge of testimony and commentary. "Believe it or not, I haven't read the report," he said, referring to Kenneth Starr's referral to Congress.
But as a political diversion, the meeting with Mr. Obuchi did not amount to much.
The lack of progress came as little surprise to the Administration. This was the fourth time in 18 months that Mr. Clinton has urged a Japanese prime minister to act quickly on resolving the banking crisis that has frozen lending and investment throughout Asia.
But despite the series of running meetings between the two countries in Tokyo, San Francisco and Washington, there is little to show in the way of progress -- beyond resentment of American pressure in Japan and frustration at Japanese intransigence in Washington.
The American strategy for dealing with Japan has been to coordinate a series of increasingly urgent-sounding warnings -- first from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Mr. Summers, then from Germany and other European countries, and most recently from the International Monetary Fund. The problem is how to direct those critiques.
In an interview on Monday and at a news conference yesterday, Mr. Obuchi appeared to agree with the broad outlines of the American strategy: to pump money into viable banks and force the sale of real estate that has been sitting on the banks' books -- mostly unsold, because the banks do not want to have to confront how far prices have fallen.
But striking that deal involves finding common ground among the strongest political forces in Japan. Among them are banks and companies that finance the country's political parties, particularly Mr. Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party. And then there are the opposition leaders, in control of the upper house of Parliament, who reflect the popular distaste for bailing out badly run banks and real estate moguls.
Mr. Obuchi seemed to reflect the difficulty of weaving through that minefield yesterday when he said he was "neither optimistic nor pessimistic" about the chances of getting financial reforms through Parliament. Taking a line from Mr. Clinton, he said that "this is not only an issue for Japan, but something that has major implications on economies of Asia as well as the whole world."
In his interview on Monday, Mr. Obuchi acknowledged that he had yet to convince the Japanese public or Parliament that the issue went beyond Japan's domestic interests. But he argued that he had been underestimated, a point he made obliquely to Mr. Clinton today when he noted that he had been compared in the American press to "cold pizza," a slight that clearly annoyed Japanese bureaucrats.
Mr. Clinton, his aides said, reassured Mr. Obuchi that he had eaten cold pizza the night before in his hotel.

HEADLINE: One Patch of Russia's Economic Crazy Quilt

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: KRASNOYARSK, Russia, Sept. 18

 BODY:
With the rugged stoicism that typifies this vast Siberian territory, Nina V. Popova thought she could ride out Russia's economic storm.
But last week tax inspectors barged into her small food shop. After poring through her ledgers, they warned her she had violated Gov. Aleksandr Lebed's new "anti-crisis" decree. 
 "They said we can only charge 10 percent more than we pay for the food," she said. "But we have to pay for electricity and heat. We have to pay for security, and we have to pay salaries. If they force this decree on us we simply won't survive."
Russia's financial crisis has not only rocked Moscow's political establishment. It has also stirred many of Russia's far-flung regions to set their own economic course and establish price controls.
A former general, presidential hopeful and the new governor of this Siberian region, Mr. Lebed has led the charge. Angry at the soaring prices that have stunned Russians, Mr. Lebed has not just declared war on inflation. He has tried to make it illegal.
He is hardly alone. From the northwestern city of Novgorod to the western territory of Yakutia, authorities are taking a page out of the socialist playbook and intervening to set prices.
Russia is fast becoming a crazy quilt of zones with Draconian price controls, territories with milder price restrictions and regions with no controls at all.
The populist decrees have brought a measure of comfort to consumers shocked by sharp jumps in prices for food and medicine.
"We may infringe on the rights of people but it is in their interest," Mr. Lebed said in interview. "The strict measures have played their role and soon will be abolished."
But the stop-gap controls also contain the seeds of new problems. Stores and factories complain they are being denied the profit they need to weather Russia's raging economic storm. Shortages have emerged, as producers ship their goods to regions where prices run free.
Virtually nobody thinks the controls are a substitute for a national strategy to rescue Russia from its economic malaise.
But with Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov still struggling to form a national Cabinet, there is no overarching plan.
Mr. Lebed owes his job to Krasnoyarsk's economic distress. Tapping the deep well of discontent, Mr. Lebed scored an upset victory over the region's incumbent Governor in a bitterly contested race last spring.
An immense region one-fourth the size of the United States, Krasnoyarsk has some of the nation's largest factories along with Siberia-size economic problems. But Mr. Lebed assured the voters that the region need an experienced crisis manager, not an economist.
Certainly, Mr. Lebed has been sorely tested. With the collapse of the ruble, tax revenues plummeted. Panic buying cleared the shelves of baby food and cold medicine, leaving the region with dangerously small reserves.
Last week, residents in the city of Krasnoyarsk, the administrative capital of the region, found themselves without hot water when the authorities ran short of coal.
The only bright spot came when Mr. Lebed hosted a glitzy popular music festival, which was sponsored by one of Russia's leading television networks -- a brief distraction in what promises to be one of the toughest winters in years.
Chastened by his region's economic woes, Mr. Lebed no longer talks confidently about single-handedly turning the situation around. Krasnoyarsk, he says, needs a greater share of the nation's tax receipts and lower rail and electricity tariffs to thrive over the long term.
It is Mr. Lebed's short-term plan, however, that has led Krasnoyarsk's citizens to draw the political battle lines. Anxious to quell the economic turmoil sweeping the nation, Mr. Lebed has decreed controls on the price of meat, fish, bread, flour, cereal, pasta, beverages and coal.
The measures officially took effect a week ago when the order was published on the front page of the regional newspaper Krasnoyarsk Worker.
Under Mr. Lebed's system, producers who want to raise the wholesale price of goods need to appeal to a panel of government officials at least five days in advance. Officially, no ceiling on wholesale prices was set. But a Lebed aide has proclaimed that producers should be satisfied with a profit of 2 percent.
Retail prices are regulated according to a formula. Shop owners are not be allowed to sell their food and beverages for more than 10 percent more than what they paid for them. And Krasnoyarsk's tax inspectors are conducting spot checks to make sure.
Mr. Lebed has emerged in recent weeks as the most popular alternative to the Communists in the public opinion polls. But his brand of capitalism is both populist and exceedingly vague. "I am certainly on the verge of breaking the law, but I think my measures are justified," Mr. Lebed said earlier this month. "The emergency situation is compelling me to take emergency measures."
Defending his price controls, Mr. Lebed said they were needed to head off a wave of frenzied buying by consumers desperate to stock up before prices soared even further.
Another goal, he said, was to stop profiteering by local producers, who were taking advantage of the crisis to ratchet up their prices even though they have been somewhat insulated from the effects of Russia's falling currency. The aim, he insisted, was not to set the price of imported goods.
"Why should milk become more expensive? Has the price of cows gone up?" he said in an interview.
Mr. Lebed is not the only one to turn to price controls. Kaliningrad has declared a state of emergency. The tax police in Novgorod have prowled through the city, fining shops for exorbitant prices.
In the southern Russian city of Stavropol, fights broke out when consumers and merchants banded together against government inspectors, who they complained were interfering with local trade.
Even pricey Moscow has imposed a 20 percent limit on the markup for basic staples, though city officials insist it is more of a guideline than a law.
Still, Mr. Lebed's decree has been assailed by his critics, who say it shows his penchant for simplistic and authoritarian solutions to complex economic problems.
"This shows that no member of the Lebed team thinks in economic terms," said Aleksei M. Kleshko, a member of the Krasnoyarsk City Council."They only know how to deal with the crisis through administrative means."
To be sure, many local factory directors and shop owners are unhappy.
"The Government acts just like it did in the days of Soviet power, when business people were considered bourgeois speculators," said Yevgeniya Kuznetsova, the president of Pikra, a local beverage company and the first factory to be privatized in the Krasnoyarsk region.
After the ruble collapsed, the upgrading of the factory's beer production unit was stopped in mid-stream after a German factory refused to provide any more equipment on credit.
That has increased the factory's need for cash. Meanwhile, sales have fallen, as consumers have cut back on their purchase or beer and soft drinks so that they can stock up on flour, grain and cooking oil.
Ms. Kuznetsova said her company will be skating too close to the edge if it is restricted to a profit rate of 2 percent. Already, she has gone to a four-day work week to reduce costs.
"The government does not seem to worry about the collapse of small and medium business," she said bitterly.
At her small shop down the street from Pikra, Ms. Popova is more distressed than angry. A sturdy woman with an engaging manner, she voted for Mr. Lebed because of his promises to bring order to Krasnoyarsk.
Ms. Popova is already something of a survivor. She set up her food store in a working class district earlier this year after the investment company she was working for went bankrupt. Her store sells sausages, bread, alcohol and cooking oil. Saleswomen receive just 360 rubles a month (about $24 at current exchange rates) for their 12-hour-a-day jobs. Because the volume of sales is low and because her store also has to pay for utilities and an alarm system, Ms. Popova needs to mark up her goods by 20 percent just to break even, she said.
The Krasnoyarsk tax police, however, were not impressed by her arguments. After shuffling through the shop's balance sheets, they told her the store was exceeding the 10 percent mark-up allowed for salt, sugar and cereal. No fines were levied yet, but Ms. Popova was summoned to the local tax office to do some explaining.
"All summer long I told our saleswomen they should be patient and that I would increase their salaries a little bit in the fall," she said. "Now, I may have to fire some of them."
Still, Ms. Popova is reluctant to assign the blame to the gruff-talking Governor.
"I pinned hopes on him because I thought he would be tough," she recalled. "But he turned out to be too tough. He's not an economist, though, and this was probably done by his team. I still hope to prove to him that this is not right, and I might even vote for him again."

HEADLINE: About New York;
An 'Invisible' Life Remains So in Death

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
JOSE SORIANO loved walking around the city. It was a welcome stress-buster from his routine of working long shifts at a Brooklyn clothing factory. Some days he sauntered through Central Park to his railroad flat in El Barrio, taking in the sights of the city he adopted eight years ago when he moved here from Mexico. His wife, Fausta, worried about him, but he shrugged off her concerns. There's always light, he reassured her. And people look out, too.
"He always said: 'I would never leave New York. I love this city,' " his wife recalled. "He said he would only leave as a dead man." 
 In the next few days, Mr. Soriano will return to Mexico just that way. In a box. On Saturday night, as he was walking home through Central Park, he was stabbed to death near Belvedere Castle. He was 47 years old and leaves behind the family that had joined him in this country only four years ago.
As is the custom among the tightly knit extended families that cushion the hard life of Mexican immigrants in New York, friends and relatives bearing food and comfort have been trooping up the dark, narrow staircase of the Sorianos' tenement home on East 106th Street.
The rooms are nearly barren, mostly just beds, dressers and pictures of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The place is quiet, save for the sound of murmured adult conversation or the squeals of babies being carried by young women.
The silence extends to the rest of the city, too. Unlike other times when people have been beaten or killed in Central Park, there has been little outrage over Mr. Soriano's death. Contrast that with past attacks on the Jogger or the Piano Teacher, to name two vicious crimes in the city's great green backyard that infuriated the public and kept journalists busy for weeks.
Nor have there been visits from the Mayor or condolence calls from the Police Commissioner. Maybe the response would have been better had early reports not inaccurately called Mr. Soriano homeless, or if the Sorianos had been tourists or more upwardly mobile. But they are the kind of people whose countrymen do the kind of drudge work that keeps the local economy growing and humming for the benefit of the leisure class.
Basically, the reaction is as dead as Mr. Soriano. And the people around him know it.
"I think there is an obvious difference in how people are treated and how crimes are treated for people who live below 96th Street and people who live above 96th Street," said the Rev. Bruce Lewandowski, the associate pastor of St. Cecilia's Roman Catholic Church, the Sorianos' parish. "You have somebody here who is a so-called 'invisible person,' an immigrant who is most likely undocumented. They're invisible. They don't count."
So much so, that it took the authorities a day to realize that Mr. Soriano was not homeless. That description might have been true a few years ago, and only in the emotional sense, as he made the transition from Mexico to New York. He had come to the city to save some money and bring his wife and two sons up north, a goal he accomplished four years ago. His wife can still remember the exact date, July 29, 1994. A Friday.
"He had gone to Mexico and I told him I did not want to stay alone anymore," she said in Spanish. "For good or bad, I came with him. I didn't want to be separated anymore. I wanted to be by his side."
TRUE enough, they even worked together in a factory that made maternity clothing. It helped ease her transition to a new country, although she stopped working nearly three years ago when their daughter Grizelle was born. Mrs. Soriano's health was not good, so he told her to stay home while he put in six days a week at the Brooklyn factory for a few hundred dollars.
"He was paid by the piece," she said. "So when he could, he would want to continue working. He was one of those people who did not want to be at home. He would leave at 6 in the morning and come home at 10."
As difficult as such a meager existence was, the Sorianos found pride in being able to provide for their three children. They knew no other way.
"He always said it was hard here, but it was harder in Mexico," Mrs. Soriano said. "I never asked the government for help. We live to work."
Last Saturday he left work and went to a store to buy a pair of baseball cleats for a friend who played with him on a team in Red Hook. For the first time in their life together in New York, he never came home. Mrs. Soriano kept an all-night vigil.
"I sat," she said. "I stood. I looked out the window for him. But no."
The next day, she said detectives spoke to her husband's teammates in Brooklyn, and that's when word of his fate finally reached her.
"I think he wanted to come home walking through the park," Mrs. Soriano said. "And he found death along the way."
The police took her to the precinct station house, she said, then let her go after a while, promising to let her know when they had something to report. She said she has not heard anything since the police arrested a suspect in the case, only to drop the charges later.
"I heard the Mayor talking about the crime on the news," she said. "But nobody called from his office. Is it because we are Hispanic? Do they think we come here to take something from them? We only come to work. Or is it because we're poor?"
Mrs. Soriano does not have enough money to send his body back to Mexico. Friends and relatives are taking up a collection, but they are just as strapped as she. Yet they offer lessons in compassion.
"When something like this happens, we talk to each other and try to help with what we can," she said. "Maybe they cannot help with money, but they can help with moral support."
She will help, too, by returning to work in the coming weeks. Her husband's bosses said she was welcome to her old job.
"I want to push my children ahead," she said. "My husband is gone. He has to rest. The dead go to rest. The living are here to struggle to keep living."
She walked over to the window where she stood on Saturday night. In her hand was a picture of her husband, natty in a baseball uniform that had "Braves" emblazoned on the jersey.
"Mira," their daughter, Grizelle said, as she tugged at the picture. "Papi. Papi."
Outside, the streets were gray and damp. A few doors away from the Sorianos' building, a wall was decorated with a mural of St. Sebastian tied to a pillar, his nearly naked body pierced by arrows.
"We walk among each other in a deep dream," read an inscription, "committing small acts of violence among one another. The heart that awakens first will take us to the heavens from this earth."

HEADLINE: Russia and U.S. Plan to Guard Atom Secrets

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Russian and American officials agreed today on a program to discourage Russia's nuclear scientists from leaving for Iraq, Iran or other aspiring nuclear powers.
The aim is to create commercial projects in Russia's closed nuclear cities, which are off-limits to foreigners and Russians without special permission. 
 Throughout the cold war, the cities produced nuclear material and weapons for the Soviet nuclear arsenal, but since the breakup they have fallen on hard times.
Nuclear workers have found themselves without jobs, and wages have been delayed for those who are employed. This month nuclear workers demanding back pay demonstrated in front of the Atomic Energy Ministry here.
Under the accord the United States will help the cities start commercial, non-military ventures. Up to $30 million is to be provided through the 1999 budget year.
The agreement covers all 10 of the closed cities. The initial assistance, however, will concentrate on three: Arzamas-16, near the Volga River city of Nizhny-Novgorod, Chelyabinsk-70, in the Urals, and Krasnoyarsk-26, in Siberia.
The accord was signed today in Vienna by Bill Richardson, the American Energy Secretary, and Yevgeny Adamov, the Russian Atomic Energy Minister.
"I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to us all that economic hardship not drive Russian nuclear weapon scientists into employment in places like Iran and North Korea," Mr. Richardson said.
Some specialists, however, said the program was far too limited given the scale of the problem, which has been aggravated by the collapse of the ruble and soaring inflation.
Kenneth Luongo, a former Energy Department official who heads a non-profit group focusing on Russian security issues, said it would take months before the first money can be dispersed because of Congressional reporting requirements in the United States.
He said the assistance should be expanded to include not just the development of new businesses but joint efforts to develop environmental technology and other forms of cooperation.
Under the accord a joint American and Russian panel will pick the commercial projects that will receive money. American officials said it was too soon to provide specifics but that the type of project they had in mind was under way at Arzamas-16, where the Russians plan to convert a warhead production plant to produce automotive parts.
In addition to investing in commercial ventures, the fund will be used to train Russian nuclear specialists in business planning. The two sides also signed a parallel agreement intended to smooth the way for the United States to buy uranium removed from Russian nuclear weapons, another potentially important source of income for the cash-strapped Russian nuclear complex.
Russia is converting highly-enriched uranium from nuclear warheads into low-enrichment uranium under a 1993 agreement with the United States. The low-enriched uranium is to delivered to the United States for use as reactor fuel.
But the deal has snagged over disputes about the terms of the sale. Today's agreement does not resolve all the outstanding differences, but the Energy Department hopes it will lead to a commercially-viable arrangement.

HEADLINE: D'Amato Ad Seeks to Exploit Upstate Resentment of New York City

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
Playing directly to upstate voters' longstanding antagonism toward New York City, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato began broadcasting a television advertisement yesterday asserting that his Democratic challenger, Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, had written off upstate New York with statements and votes throughout his career.
"Liberal Brooklyn Congressman Chuck Schumer doesn't think upstate New York matters," the announcer says over the bouncy sounds of lounge music, while the screen depicts a jagged saw cutting off the rest of New York State and leaving only downstate behind. The advertisement will air only north of New York City, Mr. D'Amato's aides said. 
 The advertisement reinforces the principal message spread by Mr. D'Amato, a Republican seeking a fourth term in Washington, during a two-day trip upstate on Sunday and Monday: that Mr. Schumer was hostile to the concerns of people who live north of New York City. To make the point, the advertisement pointed to statements and votes cast by Mr. Schumer, going back to 1977, on bills ranging from cutting dairy price supports to raising gas taxes.
"On Election Day, send Chuck Schumer a message: There's more to New York State than just Brooklyn," the announcer says.
Mr. Schumer's advisers attacked the advertisement as polarizing and politically out of bounds. "It is a desperate and misleading attempt at division from a candidate who is behind in the polls," said Howard L. Wolfson, Mr. Schumer's spokesman. "Chuck Schumer is a tax-cutting, crime-fighting Democrat and Al D'Amato just doesn't know how to react to that."
Mr. D'Amato's decision to air the stark advertisement -- and risk both alienating supporters in New York City and courting criticism that he is seeking to divide voters -- clearly signals the political weight he is attaching to upstate in this difficult re-election campaign. Mr. D'Amato's advisers, explaining the reasons behind the pointed attack, said that based on past elections, they expected 45 percent of the vote to come from upstate, compared with 30 percent in New York City and 25 percent from the suburbs.
In 1994, Gov. George E. Pataki also banked on upstate support to defeat Mario M. Cuomo, but avoided direct appeals to rivalries between the two parts of the state. In this campaign, Mr. Pataki, who is by all accounts in a strong position as he seeks a second term this year, has made a particularly vigorous appeal for support from downstate voters -- an appeal that Democrats said yesterday might be complicated by the emerging tactic of his fellow Republican.
In effect, Mr. Pataki and Mr. D'Amato are offering different political responses to what they each perceive as the same problem: that Republicans will be hurt this year by the struggling upstate economy. Mr. D'Amato is trying to push up his vote upstate, where he has historically been strong, while Mr. Pataki, who is looking for a large re-election victory to enhance his credentials as a national candidate, is looking to New York City for support.
In making the advertisement, Mr. D'Amato's advisers combed through Mr. Schumer's record in Congress and the State Assembly, seeking votes that served the interests of Mr. Schumer's constituents in Brooklyn but might not sit well with voters elsewhere in the state. For example, Mr. Schumer voted for two bills designed to curb payments to dairy farmers, to the benefit of milk drinkers. He also voted three times to increase the gas tax, another position that was not likely to offend the sentiment in his urban district.
Mr. D'Amato's advisers called the attack a fair case based on Mr. Schumer's record. "These are his quotes and his votes," said Kieran Mahoney, a senior political adviser to Mr. D'Amato. "And I think if anybody had some concerns about this, it would be the 40 percent of New Yorkers who live west of the Hudson River and north of the Tappan Zee Bridge."
However, Mr. Schumer's aides disputed one central element of Mr. D'Amato's advertisement -- its quotation of Mr. Schumer as saying, "To me, the West begins across the Hudson River."
Mr. Wolfson said the comment was taken out of context. And a transcript of the April 1997 press conference where Mr. Schumer made it suggests he was making a joke. Mr. Schumer mistakenly identified Senator Richard J. Durbin as being from Idaho. He is from Illinois.
"To you, I am from a Western state," Mr. Durbin said, according to Federal News Service, which transcribes news conferences in Washington.
The transcript describes Mr. Schumer as laughing, and then saying: "That's right. To me, the West begins across the Hudson River. In any case, we are glad to be here."
Mr. Mahoney defended the use of the quotation. "He said it," Mr. Mahoney said.
Mr. D'Amato's supporters did not offer any apologies for the tactics. Asked if they were playing to prejudice among upstaters against city residents, Edward I. Koch, the former Mayor who lost his 1982 bid for governor largely because of a poor showing upstate, let out a howl: "Absolutely!"
He called Mr. Schumer a typical New York City politician -- and he did not mean that as a compliment. The Congressman, Mr. Koch said, "takes credit for everything. He's a stereotype."
"Not all is fair in love and war," Mr. Koch said. "This is fair. It's not unfair to say that a candidate that comes from one section of the state might discriminate in favor of the section he comes from."
New York's voting history offers an explanation for Mr. D'Amato's tactics. In 1992, he defeated Robert Abrams, his Democratic opponent, by about 81,000 votes out of 7 million cast. Mr. Abrams won New York City by just over 460,000 votes, and Mr. D'Amato made up the difference by his showing in the suburbs and upstate.
And Mr. D'Amato, who was born in Brooklyn and made his name on Long Island, would appear to have little to lose in the county that he once called home. At last count, there were 133,913 registered Republicans in Kings County, compared with 846,512 Democrats.

HEADLINE: HOT SPOTS/SILICON HOLLOW;
Bomb's Birthplace Gets Down to Business

BYLINE: By CHRIS WOHLWEND 

DATELINE: OAK RIDGE, Tenn.

 BODY:
THIS city of 28,000 accepted long ago that its claim to fame was as a birthplace of the atomic bomb, which also brought a modicum of fortune.
It was here that uranium was enriched for the first nuclear weapons. And even though nuclear fuel is still manufactured by the Oak Ridge National Laboratories, the end of the cold war and ensuing layoffs and buyouts left a high concentration of brainpower in this area idle. That talent pool has since become a lure for entrepreneurs interested in capitalizing on the city's history of science and technology. 
 "The technical thinking has always been here," said Thomas C. Rogers, a business leader active in development projects in what locals call Silicon Hollow. What was missing was a mechanism to harness that thinking into profitable purposes.
That is why Technology 2020 was born, a nonprofit "incubator" geared to high-tech endeavors, the product of a collaboration among the Oak Ridge and Knoxville chambers of commerce, the University of Tennessee and the Energy Department. Financing is provided by the Energy Department, the university and private companies like BellSouth, Motorola and U.S. Internet, as well as Lockheed Martin and Bechtel Jacobs, the primary contractors for the Federal laboratories here.
As Mr. Rogers, the president of Technology 2020, described it, the organization provides space, up-to-the-minute communications networks and mentoring and guidance for technology start-ups. "First it's, 'Look, it works,' from the technical people, then it's, 'What's the market for it?' " Mr. Rogers explained. "That's where we come in."
The first graduate of Technology 2020 was Pro-2-Serve, which assembles teams of technicians and engineers to work on short-term projects, like screening prospective managers for a John Deere plant and developing a personal computer-based firefighter qualification system for the National Association of State Foresters and the Forest Service.
Pro-2-Serve's president, Barry Goss, and his wife, Karen Goss, the co-founder, said they knew that people in Oak Ridge had precision skills in narrowly defined fields that could be used in a variety of applications. In 1997, its first full year of operation, the company grossed $3 million in revenues.
The graybeard of rebirth here is Ipix, founded 12 years ago by Steve Zimmerman and Lee Martin, engineers at Oak Ridge National Laboratories. Their idea was to remove the distortion from photographs that are made with a 180-degree (fisheye) lens. In two years, they developed software that with a digital camera provides a 360-degree undistorted view of an image by using only two photographs, thereby creating an "immersive" experience for viewers.
The applications? Someone buying a house can "stand" in a room on the Internet and "tour" the entire space. Or an Elvis Presley aficionado can visit the Graceland Web site and take in the King's Jungle Room. Or a football fan can take the field with his favorite N.F.L. team. And it can all be done on the home computer.
Ipix, now headed by a former Motorola executive, Jim Phillips, is flush with victories in two patent-protection suits and has landed contracts with Kodak, Nikon, CNN, the Discovery Channel and other companies, including car makers and resort chains. "The top graduates from M.I.T. and Princeton come here to work," Mr. Phillips said. "When I say we're in Oak Ridge, people all over the world -- scientists, engineers -- know exactly what I'm talking about."

HEADLINE: McCall Says Pension Fund Is to Invest in Small Concerns

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
A month after he warned that New York City's economy is too dependent on the financial giants on Wall Street, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall announced that the state employees' pension fund would invest $100 million in a program that makes loans to small businesses in the city and around the state.
The loans should help create jobs for workers with few skills in communities where work is hard to find, Mr. McCall said. The 15-year loans are administered by the New York Business Development Corporation, a private organization created by the State Legislature in the 1950's and financed by 159 banks around the state. 
 Despite the job benefits, the pension fund is less interested in doing good than in making a profit, Mr. McCall said. "You may describe this as socially responsible," he said of the program, "but we see it as a sound investment."
A similar $100 million investment that the fund made 10 years ago has had an annual return of 7.75 percent, according to the Comptroller's office.
The earlier investment financed 290 loans worth $82 million, which the Comptroller's office said created almost 8,000 jobs.
"These are people you can really depend on," Mr. McCall said of the borrowers. "They are putting their heart and soul, and some of their own money, into it."
The new $100 million investment is actually small potatoes for the $105 billion pension fund, which covers 880,000 state and local government workers. The booming stock market has produced unusually high returns for the fund, which last year had a 30 percent gain on its investments; during the last two years, taxpayers have saved $530 million, because the big investment gains meant that governments were able to contribute less to the pension system, Mr. McCall said.
While the profits from a small-business investment program are far lower than those produced by the stock market during the last few years, they are far steadier, Mr. McCall said. The fund diversifies, he said, so that "it is not affected by the current ups and downs in the market."
Mr. McCall, who is running for re-election, made his announcement in front of Fine Fare Grocers, a supermarket on Frederick Douglass Boulevard just north of 132d Street in Harlem. Three years ago, the spot was a vacant lot, which Mariano Diaz bought from the city with the help of a $200,000 loan from the program, he said.
Mr. Diaz, whose family is in the grocery business and who already owned a food store on 110th Street, said he took the risk of opening the new supermarket, which is surrounded by several housing projects, because he could own the building himself.
"I control my own destiny," he said, instead of paying a landlord. Today, Mr. Diaz and his wife, Iris, employ 15 people at the store, and have opened another in Brooklyn.
Another beneficiary of the program is Centre Fence, a Bronx company that sells and installs chain-link fences. A $600,000 loan allowed the company to buy a warehouse in Throgs Neck. Because Centre Fence now owns its own building, it has been able to become bonded to do larger jobs, said Marty Friedman, the company's controller.
Business is now so good, Mr. Friedman said, that the company has hired and is training 8 unskilled workers to help out its 10 longtime employees.
Without the program, the company would have had a hard time expanding, he said. Unlike a bank, the program was willing to finance almost the whole purchase price of the warehouse.
Besides, he said, "banks always had the attitude that you had to prove you didn't need the money in order to get it."

HEADLINE: Two Hospitals on the Same Block In Brooklyn Discuss Partnership

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
The state-run University Hospital of Brooklyn and the city-run Kings County Hospital Center, which face each other from opposite sides of Clarkson Avenue in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn, have agreed to begin talks aimed at creating a partnership.
Officials for both hospitals said that while collaborations had periodically been discussed -- and abandoned -- for nearly a decade, the increasingly competitive health-care market in the city had made it virtually impossible to sustain two hospitals on the same block. 
 The board of the State University of New York, which runs University Hospital, voted unanimously yesterday to begin joint planning discussions with the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the agency responsible for New York City's 11 public hospitals and assorted clinics and nursing homes. The corporation's board is expected to vote on, and pass, a similar resolution when it meets today.
University Hospital, which is better known as Downstate, already provides all the doctors and medical services at Kings County through an affiliation contract with the city. For decades, the Health and Hospitals Corporation has paid academic medical centers hundreds of millions of dollars each year to run its public hospitals.
But despite the fact that doctors at both hospitals crossed the street to work, the institutions remained competitive, often vying for the same patients and operating independently with separate administrative, planning, medical, nursing and purchasing departments. The city has long complained that doctors from Downstate poached insured patients, leaving Kings County with the poorest and sickest patients.
"We need to work cooperatively rather than competitively," said Peter Pileggi, the associate provost for health education and hospitals in the state university system's office of campus liaison. "These discussions are designed to continue fostering our education mission within an integrated delivery system."
One factor driving the collaboration talks is the poor physical state of Kings County, a hulking, crumbling hospital and one of the few in the city that still houses patients in open wards. The city first talked about rebuilding it in the early 1960's, and in 1983 came up with a plan that was to be completed by 1986.
Fifteen years later, the city has spent about $110 million and has almost nothing to show for the money except a series of fraud investigations and lawsuits.
In many ways, health industry experts said, the two hospitals are well suited to join forces. Kings County, with 756 beds and 4,673 employees, has an active trauma center and a complex of primary-care clinics; Downstate, with 376 beds and 1,970 employees, has no emergency room and focuses on research and specialty care, like cardiac and orthopedic surgery.
Officials at both institutions acknowledged that any kind of joint agreement, even one that falls short of a full-scale merger, would have to include difficult labor negotiations. Employees at the two hospitals are not represented by the same unions. In addition, people in the community have mixed feelings about such a partnership, trying to understand complex economic forces but fearing a cutback in services to a population that is poorer and sicker than most others in the city.
"There are real challenges to completing this agreement," said Dr. Luis Marcos, president of the hospitals corporation. "But a unified hospital is the best choice for the future of health care in central Brooklyn."

HEADLINE: 150 Million Jobless, Global Study Says

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Sept. 23

 BODY:
At least 150 million people worldwide are jobless, and this number is expected to rise by millions before the end of the year, the International Labor Organization said today.
At least 10 million people have joined the unemployed this year because of the financial crisis in Asia, the I.L.O. said in issuing its World Employment Report, 1998-99. 
 By year-end, as many as 12 million more could be unemployed, mostly in Asia, said Rashid Amjad, the report's author. The newly released global jobless numbers are up substantially from the previous I.L.O. compilation in 1996-97, which listed 128 million jobless.
Among the unemployed are an estimated 60 million people between the ages of 15 and 24, who are searching for work but cannot find it, said the study by the I.L.O., a United Nations agency based in Geneva.
Only labor markets in the United States and, to a lesser extent, the European Union, benefited from economic growth in the first half of 1998, the 258-page report said.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Greenspan's Congressional Testimony

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from testimony yesterday by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, before the Senate Budget Committee and an exchange between Mr. Greenspan and Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire and a committee member, in a question-and-answer session following the testimony: 
 When I testified before the Congress in July, I noted that some of the effects of the international crisis had actually been positive for the United States financial markets and economy, for example, by lowering long-term interest rates paid by our households and businesses. However, the most recent, more virulent phase of the crisis has infected our markets as well. Concerns about business profits and a general pulling back from risk-taking in the midst of great uncertainty around the globe have driven down stock prices and pushed up rates on the bonds of lower-rated borrowers. Flows of funds through financial markets have been disrupted, at least temporarily. . . .
There is little evidence to date, however, that foreign problems or the tightening in financial conditions in domestic markets have produced any significant underlying weakness in the American economy as a whole. Moreover, labor markets remain tight and hourly compensation has continued to grow more rapidly. Nonetheless, the increases in overall costs and the C.P.I. have been held to modest levels by reasonably good productivity advances, lower oil prices and foreign competition.
However, looking forward, the restraining effects of recent developments on the U.S. economy are likely to intensify. As I noted in Congressional testimony last week, we can already see signs of the erosion of production around the edges, especially in manufacturing. Disappointing profits in a number of industries and less rapid expansion of sales suggest some stretching out of capital investment plans in the months ahead. Lower equity prices and higher financing costs should damp household and business spending, and greater uncertainty and risk aversion may also lead to more cautious spending behavior.
When I testified on monetary policy in July, I explained that the Federal Open Market Committee was concerned that high -- indeed rising -- demand for labor could produce cost pressures on our economy that would disrupt the ongoing expansion. I also noted that a high real Federal funds rate was a necessary offset to expansionary conditions elsewhere in financial markets. By mid-August, the committee believed that disruptions abroad and more cautious behavior by investors at home meant that the risks to the expansion had become evenly balanced. Since then, deteriorating foreign economies and their spillover to domestic markets have increased the possibility that the slowdown in the growth of the American economy will be more than sufficient to hold inflation in check. . . .

MR. GREGG: Mr. Chairman, you talked about the need for an ad hoc remedy at this time because you can't put in place the long-term actions which would require -- which are required to get what you think is a sound financial process throughout the world. Would part of that ad hoc remedy or an element of that ad hoc remedy be constructively impacted by a rate cut in the United States?

MR. GREENSPAN: I thought that would be the second or third question.

MR. GREGG: Let's get it out early, you know.

MR. GREENSPAN: Obviously, I can't be directly responsive to that question. All I can say to you --

MR. GREGG: I'm talking about in theoretical terms, in the ad hoc -- in the ad hoc remedy concept.
MR. GREENSPAN: I got the point. I've been able to string more words into fewer ideas than anybody I know, and I'm continuing to do that.
Let me say this: that I and my colleagues at the F.O.M.C. and amongst the central bank governors are pretty much engaged on a day-by-day basis -- in many cases, hourly, hour-by-hour -- in watching the processes that are going on and trying to understand them better.
I do think we're getting and perhaps we'll reach some conclusions as to what is fundamentally wrong, meaning what are the shortfalls in the existing system, similar to the types of notions which I raised in my prepared remarks.
But I do think that we have to bring the existing instabilities to a level of stability reasonably shortly, to prevent the contagion from really spilling over and creating some very significant further difficulties for all of us.
I can't comment on this particular stage what particular actions will or will not be taken. But I really would suggest to you that I think we know where we have to go. I think we understand the process. I do not think we underestimate the severity of the problems with which we are dealing. But exactly what instruments we will employ and well -- and when they will be employed -- I'm not at liberty at this stage to offer it, because I'm not the only person involved in making those decisions.

HEADLINE: Brazil Makes Fast Recovery From Brink of Economic Collapse

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil Sept. 23

 BODY:
Only two weeks ago Brazil's stock market was crashing and its banking system was leaking currency reserves at a rate of more than $2 billion a day. Financial collapse or a crushing devaluation looked almost inevitable.
But the panic that throttled this business and finance center has subsided just as suddenly as it emerged as an outgrowth of the currency crisis in Russia. At least temporarily, Brazil's stock market and banking system appear to have stabilized, adding to the evidence that the financial contagion spreading around the world is linked to unpredictable flights of perception and mood that can shift from one week to the next. 
 No serious expert says Brazil is out of trouble yet. Indeed, a recession caused by high interest rates looks virtually inevitable in 1999, and the Government faces tough choices to reduce a fiscal deficit that represents better than 7 percent of gross domestic product. But the Brazilian stock market has recovered better than 50 percent since Sept. 10. Volatility has subsided, with far lower daily trading volumes until today, when the market shot up almost 11 percent, largely in response to remarks in Washington by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, suggesting that he might favor lower interest rates.
More importantly, local economists point out, the volume of capital flight has slowed to a manageable, though still troublesome, $500 million a day.
As the ninth largest economy in the world and the principal motor of Latin America's economic growth, Brazil's improving fortunes have helped strengthen the Mexican peso, eased fears that Argentina might have to remove its peso from a dollar peg, and led a modest rally in most of the region's stock markets.
"Ten days ago we were talking about the end of the world," said Mauro Schneider, vice president for economic research at ING Barings here. "Things could still change overnight, but you don't see investors selling at any price anymore." Paulo Mallman, finance director of BicBanco, a Brazilian bank, said: "The panic is over. Apparently the crisis has eased a little bit."
Such expressions of what can be described at best as cautious optimism reflect Brazil's continued vulnerability to events outside its control, such as a potential stock market plunge in the United States, a collapse of the new Government in Russia, or a reversal in the improving fortunes of the Japanese yen. But they also seem to suggest that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the Clinton Administration, and the International Monetary Fund and other world lending institutions may have weeks or months -- rather than days as some once feared -- to construct a coordinated rebuilding effort based on new loans and slashing the Brazilian Government deficit.
President Cardozo sent mixed signals in recent weeks about whether he would seek an I.M.F. lending package, but in a speech today he said it was "in the country's interests to carve out" a bailout package. Experts believe such a package could include contributions of up to $50 billion from the I.M.F., the World Bank and other institutions.
The Brazilian crisis peaked on Sept. 10 when the Brazilian stock market plummeted 16 percent in a single day. On that Thursday and Friday Brazilian and foreign businesses and individuals withdrew a total of $4 billion from Brazilian banks. While the stock market was down 50 percent for the year, the banking system's dollar reserves had fallen from $74 billion to $51 billion over the course of a single month.
Panic set in when not even the Government's doubling of interest rates to better than 40 percent stemmed the tide of capital flight. But the psychology began to change with a speech on Sept. 11 by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, which broke weeks of silence from the Clinton Administration that had left investors confused about United States policy.
"The financial stability and prosperity of Brazil is of vital importance to the U.S.," Mr. Rubin said in a statement that has become a mantra for local investors seeking reassurance. In the next few days President Clinton and officials of the I.M.F. and the Group of Seven leading industrial countries declared they would stand by Latin America, helping to reverse a growing impression among businesses and investors that capital controls and a steep devaluation of the Brazilian currency were imminent.
After the calming words from abroad, said Bolivar Lamounier, a political consultant to several banks here, "people sat down and thought through what they were doing." Several experts noted that recent polls showing that President Cardoso would win a landslide victory on Oct. 4, giving him far more political clout to deal with the crisis, also helped calm investors.
Then last week the Government bolstered its ailing accounts by successfully completing privatization sales of a state bank and two power companies worth better than $2 billion.
After the privatizations, ING Barings released a report last Friday suggesting that Brazil might be able to speed up divestitures, including its huge oil company Petrobras and the enormous commercial bank Banco do Brasil, to raise more needed capital. The report concluded on a hopeful note, saying, "Despite the financial turmoil, foreign corporations still express great interest in purchasing strategic concerns from the Brazilian government."
Carlos Kawall L. Ferreira, Citibank's chief economist in Brazil, said he was heartened by the deceleration of capital flight.
He said most of the money now leaving the country was related to stock sales or corporations paying off debts in anticipation of an economic slowdown.
"We're not seeing the same panic anymore," Mr. Ferreira said. Still, noting that reserves had fallen to $47 billion, he added: "My fear is the money will not come back in the next several weeks or months. International support will be needed for Brazil."

HEADLINE: James Fletcher, 63, a Banker In Poor Chicago Areas, Dies

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
James Fletcher, chairman of the South Shore Bank, a pioneering lender to some of the poorer neighborhoods in Chicago, died of complications of lymphoma on Sept. 16 at St. Joseph's Hospital in Chicago. He was 63 and a lifelong resident of the city.
Mr. Fletcher was one of a group of idealistic young bankers in the early 1970's who transformed a struggling commercial bank into a model of how a for-profit company could help revitalize deteriorating communities. 
 South Shore has been one of few banks to operate in low-income neighborhoods and make money investing in the community. Many locally owned banks in low-income neighborhoods are criticized because they are run very conservatively, making few loans with the deposits they gather. Others, notably Freedom National Bank in Harlem, have failed because of lending policies that were too aggressive.
Mr. Fletcher "felt very strongly that we had a dual objective, to make a profit and to do development work," said Milton Davis, the vice chairman of the Shorebank Corporation, South Shore's holding company, and one of the bankers who took over the company in 1973.
"If there was an application for a loan that might not be profitable but would contribute enormously to the development of an area, he would always take the side of development," Mr. Davis said. "But he was successful in finding a way to put a credit on the books of the bank structured in a way that we were sure to be repaid."
Mr. Fletcher was born on Jan. 21, 1935, in Chicago. After graduating from Northern Illinois University in 1958, he served three years in the Marine Corps and then taught in the Chicago public schools for three years.
In 1963, he joined the Chicago Committee on Urban Opportunity as an urban planner for the city's anti-poverty program. He held several other government jobs before joining Hyde Park Bank and Trust, near the University of Chicago, in 1969 to work in its urban redevelopment lending division.
The South Shore Bank, then a traditional commercial bank, was struggling to survive as its neighborhood population changed from white to black. It wanted to move into the Standard Oil Building in downtown Chicago, but its application was rejected by the Federal Government after protests by the community.
In 1972, several executives from Hyde Park Bank, including Ronald A. Grzywinski, its president, raised $4 million from foundations, church groups and wealthy individuals to buy South Shore and devote it to community development.
Mr. Fletcher left Hyde Park for South Shore in 1978. At first, he ran a fund that made equity investments in small businesses and a nonprofit institute, linked to the bank, that operated some of the development projects.
In 1983 he was named president of South Shore Bank, and in 1996 he became chairman.
The success of South Shore drew the attention of Bill Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Mr. Clinton encouraged the establishment of a similar bank in Little Rock, and in his 1992 Presidential campaign he promised to encourage other community development banks modeled on South Shore.
But South Shore's practices have at times been criticized.
Several community groups and black churches protested South Shore's acquisition of Indecorp, the largest black-owned bank in Chicago, in 1995. They complained that South Shore was mainly owned by white people and big companies, including the largest commercial banks in Chicago. Mr. Grzywinski, the chairman, and many of the managers are white. Mr. Davis is black, as was Mr. Fletcher.
Since the acquisition, however, South Shore has increased the loans that are made at the Indecorp branches from 30 percent of deposits to 70 percent.
Mr. Fletcher is survived by his wife, the former Norma Gant; his mother, Mildred Fletcher Holtz of Milwaukee; three daughters, Cheryl Mulholland of Costa Mesa, Calif., and Maria Barksdale and Kathleen Lisciotto, both of Chicago; a son, James P. Fletcher of Chicago; seven grandchildren, and two sisters, Kathleen Hall of Racine, Wis., and Sharon F. Schultz of Milwaukee.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes to Curb Bankruptcy Abuse by Consumers

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
The Senate voted overwhelmingly today to overhaul the bankruptcy system and make it more difficult for consumers to walk away from debts.
The sweeping clampdown on consumers, especially those who are perceived as able to repay their debts, reflects a strong sense in Congress that widespread abuse of the bankruptcy system has spurred a record number of personal bankruptcies in each of the last three years, despite the booming economy. 
 In making it harder for debtors to walk away from their unpaid bills, the legislation would help banks and credit-card companies recoup billions of dollars a year.
"The free ride is over," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who shepherded the bill to passage.
The bill passed by a lopsided vote of 97 to 1. Only Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, voted against it. Mr. Wellstone said that he was offended by the relentless, multimillion-dollar lobbying effort by banks and credit-card companies on behalf of the bill and that consumers were "left out of the loop."
But today's vote does not guarantee that the bill will become law. The Senate version must now be reconciled with a House bill, which is vastly different, and time is running out for lawmakers to reach an accord.
Not only does Congress plan to adjourn in less than three weeks, but the members who must resolve the differences between the two bills have less time than others. The bills started in the judiciary committees in each house, which means those committees must send members to the joint House-Senate conference to reconcile the bills. But the House Judiciary Committee is so consumed with whether to impeach President Clinton that it seems to have little time for other matters.
"A lot of people are wondering if Judiciary has the time," Mr. Grassley said. "It's a major problem."
The Clinton Administration has left itself considerable leeway for final negotiations on the bill. In a statement of policy, officials said they generally supported the Senate version but wanted a final bill to curtail abuses by creditors, not just debtors. It was not clear whether the Senate bill, which does address creditor abuse to some degree, went far enough for the Administration.
Both the Senate and House, which passed its bill in June, spurned numerous attempts by Democrats to tighten the rules on banks and credit-card companies to make them more accountable for lending practices that lure consumers, even those already heavily in debt, with solicitations for additional credit.
The Senate version, however, would require banks and credit card companies to disclose to consumers in every monthly bill how much they will owe over the months -- or, more likely, years -- in accumulated debt and interest if they make only the minimum payment.
And the Senate bill would crack down on people who move to states like Florida and Texas, which protect them if they put all their money into expensive houses and then file for bankruptcy.
The Administration has called the House bill too stringent. That version, much preferred by the bank and credit-card industries, imposes an income test on those who seek protection from creditors under Chapter 7, which erases most debt.
But by contrast, the more lenient Senate version gives judges some discretion in determining whether someone files under Chapter 7 or goes through a more rigorous repayment schedule under Chapter 13.
Still, the bills in both houses are grounded in a similar philosophy that the White House seems to share: that filing for bankruptcy has become too easy and, with a record 1.35 million consumers filing in 1997, unfairly cost American business $40 billion in that year alone.
Credit-card lending is among the most profitable sectors of the banking industry, which otherwise has little room for growth. The industry estimates that the bills in both houses could help them recoup $4 billion a year.
Many Democratic Senators who spoke out earlier against the bill wound up voting for it. One, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, maintains that the Senate version is so preferable to the House version that he wants to strengthen the hand of Senate conferees in negotiating with the House.
But many longtime allies of those Democrats were disappointed with the vote. Gary Klein, director of the National Consumer Law Center, said the Senate's provisions were better than the House's, but he added, "It is unclear whether those provisions are strong enough to prevent abusive marketing practices prevalent in the extension of consumer credit."
Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard law professor who opposes the bill, applauded the Senate for acknowledging for the first time that credit-card companies were responsible for some consumer debt. But she still argues that it is a bad bill. "How can democratically elected representatives vote to transfer wealth from financially troubled families to corporate lenders who are making record profits?" she asked.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
As Placebo Or RealCure, Fed Rate Cut Seems Closer

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
Everybody seems to want the Federal Reserve policy makers to cut interest rates when they meet Tuesday. And why not? With financial chaos sweeping through Asia, Russia and now Latin America, a rate cut would seem a smart inoculation against recession for the domestic economy. That is certainly the view of the Business Roundtable, a group of corporate leaders, as it vigorously lobbies for the Fed to cut the cost of borrowing for American businesses. Lower rates would also help individual debtors and foreign countries saddled with loans that must be repaid in dollars.
Alan Greenspan, in Congressional testimony yesterday, encouraged investors to anticipate a small cut when he noted that "deteriorating foreign economies and their spillover to domestic markets" were slowing the economy and tilting the Fed's concern from worrying about inflation to worrying about recession. 
 Yet, true to their reputations as party poopers, many economists side with Allan Meltzer, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, who labels a rate cut premature. At most, a plausible case can be made for a middle ground -- a small, therefore symbolic, cut next week that would not, unless conditions drastically change, be followed by additional cuts.
There is no compelling economic case yet for prolonged easing by the Fed.
The talk of a rate cut starts with the fact that a quarter of the world's population is mired in recession or worse. Investors, with a self-fulfilling fear that countries are about to devalue or run out of reserves, are fleeing with dollars that these countries cannot afford to cough up. Even the Japanese economy, the world's second largest, has slipped into recession this year. Brazil, the ninth-largest economy, flirts with its own financial crisis.
The impact is already being felt in the United States. Exports are dropping, as are commercial property prices, housing starts and consumer confidence, a harbinger of consumer spending. Major American banks are announcing overseas losses, which might force them to retrench on domestic as well as foreign lending.
Rate cuts, proponents say, could mitigate these recessionary shocks by encouraging consumers and businesses to spend more. Rate cuts could also help nudge down interest rates abroad, easing the burden on debtor countries and giving foreign investors reason to believe that their investments are secure.
But Mr. Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon says the economic blows to the United States are "little more than rumor."
"The groups that are screaming the loudest for rate cuts are the ones that yelped for the Fed to keep its hands off the economy when its chairman cautioned against irrational exuberance," he said. "In fact, the economy is strong and needs no help from the Fed."
In fact, unemployment rates are at their lowest levels in three decades, retail sales are brisk, and housing starts, though they dropped last month, remain well above last year's levels. Business fixed investment is rising, and stock prices, though well off their summer peaks, remain high by many measures.
Mickey Levy, chief economist at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, says: "Falling oil prices, interest rates and ample growth of the money supply provide for healthy growth of the economy. If the Fed eases anyway, it could create inflationary pressures down the line."
What would persuade these economists to support rate cuts? Concrete evidence that prices are falling or that bank reserves are dipping to dangerous levels, threatening a credit crunch. Neither is true. Wages, the primary component of prices, are rising at a 4 percent annual clip. And bank capital, according to David Hilder of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, is substantial -- by his estimates about 30 percent above the levels recommended by regulators. Banks have enough reserves to absorb substantial losses from investments in Asia and other trouble spots without cutting off domestic borrowers.
Mr. Levy supplies another reason for the Fed to refrain from repeated rate cuts. "They solve no big problem and in places abroad threaten to do more harm than good," he concludes. Rate cuts cannot help Russia, whose problems are rooted in corrupt and incompetent government policies, or Japan, whose banks are buried in loans to bankrupt companies. Rate cuts could even drive down the dollar, thereby raising the price of Japanese and Brazilian exports, depressing sales and further shrinking those economies.
The major problem abroad is psychological, argues Alan Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who is an unapologetic liberal and a self-proclaimed "inflation dove." As an academic and Fed member, he has advocated looser monetary policies than most of his colleagues deem prudent. Yet even he rejects calls for steep rate cuts now. "The United States is one of the few countries that does not need a monetary boost now," Mr. Blinder said, "and the Fed should divert its focus to the needs of foreign economies only with the frequency of 50-year hurricanes."
Instead, Mr. Blinder makes a clever, if tentative, case for taking a half step. The problem abroad, he says, is a "crisis of confidence that has one investor's fear feed on another's. It is plausible to address a fear that is at its root psychological with symbolic measures."
Specifically, the Fed could -- ideally in cooperation with the reluctant Germans -- cut rates by a small amount, say, a quarter or perhaps even a half of a percentage point. Such amounts, he admits, are too small to do much good but also too small to pose a serious inflation threat if the economy remains strong. The act could, however, send a reassuring signal to investors that the Fed is prepared to step in as needed to keep financial markets on an even keel. Mr. Blinder ponders no more than this half step.
The question then is whether the Fed, too, is contemplating a rate cut to calm jittery investors or a prolonged strategy to ease monetary policy.

Questions on Coca-Cola in Market Turmoil Abroad

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Coca-Cola Company executives have summoned Wall Street analysts for a hastily scheduled meeting tomorrow morning in New York, suggesting that the leading soft-drink company is about to deliver ominous news about earnings.
Coke derives most of its fortunes from overseas, where economic crises have ravaged the earnings of many American multinational companies. 
 The Atlanta-based company declined to comment about the substance of the meeting, other than to call it "a volume and earnings update for the third quarter and the full year." But it is the first time Coke has organized an analysts' briefing on such short notice -- analysts were called on Tuesday -- and the first briefing since the economic crisis now afflicting Asia, Russia and Latin America began more than a year ago.
Things are already at a relative low point for Coke; many analysts have already reduced their forecasts for volumes and earnings over the last few weeks, and the share price has plummeted from a mid-July high of $88.938 to $58 at the market's close yesterday, on a day when the broad market rose more than 3 percent. In addition, the company was dealt a setback by the French Government last week, which rejected Coke's plans to buy the Orangina brand from Pernod-Ricard S.A.
Questions about Coke's profitability abroad have intensified as the economic problems overseas have worsened. Will key Latin American markets, like Mexico, be the next to fall? Is Eastern Europe, in the shadow of the stagnant Russian economy, about to unravel? How bad will sales be in Japan, where they were off 3 percent in the second quarter? How much of all this already is reflected in Coke's stock price?
Gillette and Procter & Gamble, two consumer-products giants often mentioned in the same breath as Coke, issued warnings about their earnings earlier this week, further raising speculation about what Coke executives might say tomorrow.
"The chances are good that we are going to see them guide near-term estimates lower," said Marc Cohen, a beverage analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company, adding that he thought the company would also offer encouragement that the fundamentals for a good long-term performance remain intact.
Mr. Cohen said he expected Coke executives to forecast sales growth of 5 percent to 6 percent for the third quarter, compared with 9 percent to 10 percent in the first half.
"We had anticipated some moderation, but it has moderated more than we thought it would," he said.
Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, who downgraded the stock from "buy" to "hold" 13 months ago, said, "They are certainly going to have to give some guidance on earnings, and they may just confirm what's out there." At the very least, the meeting, with Coke's chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, and the company's chief financial officer, James E. Chestnut, is expected to focus on how Coke, which last year collected two-thirds of its profits outside the United States, plans to navigate this latest downturn. While Coke has shown skill at running its business in individual countries despite local economic problems -- the Mexican peso crisis in 1994-95, during which Coke proved itself better equipped than some local brands to withstand the pressure, and wound up with more market share, is often cited -- the current challenge is greater.
"These are macroeconomic factors that they have to manage through," said Doug Lane, a beverage analyst with Merrill Lynch, "and they've never had to do it on such a broad-based scale. That's what's different this time."
Mr. Lane said Latin America, where Coke made about 17.5 percent of its profits last year, was already starting to show signs of a slowdown in its consumption of Coke products. In Mexico, he added, sales were still strong but he expected them to slow; yesterday Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on the main Coke bottler in Mexico, Coke Femsa, from "buy" to "neutral."
Mr. Ivester and Mr. Chestnut are expected to reiterate Coke's longtime position, that economic downturns present investment opportunities for the company around the world, and that Coke is generally planning more for the long term. Bill Pecoriello, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein, said the picture may become bleaker once additional factors are included. Much of the downgrading so far, he said, has come from concerns about currency devaluations that hurt multinational company earnings abroad when converted into dollars.
"Now what you're talking about is revisions related not only to falling sales volume, but also increased sales expenses," he said. "They are not reducing the market spending in the short run, which means you are spending more than you would have per unit, had the volume not decelerated."
Another analyst, Emanuel Goldman of Paine Webber in San Francisco, said he remained bullish on Coke, and had met with his sales force yesterday to tell them that "the time to buy Coke is when it breaks."
"The irony of all this is that the long-term story is as strong as it's ever been," Mr. Goldman said. "This doesn't mean that they are having fun right now. But they are very good at managing within environments that for some companies would be very difficult."

HEADLINE: A Cornucopia of Native Foie Gras;
Partners' Efforts Produce Menu Delicacy in Abundance

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

DATELINE: FERNDALE, N.Y.

 BODY:
Not long ago, a sumptuous slice of fresh foie gras, cut from the fat-rich liver of a force-fed duck or goose, was a rarity on American menus. Even as French restaurants flourished in the 1980's, desperate chefs usually had to settle for canned pates. Those willing to defy Federal restrictions on imports of raw poultry even had the delicacy smuggled from France inside fish bellies.
Nowadays, though, top restaurants across the nation are awash in fresh foie gras. The delicacy is so abundant that chefs have indulged in American-style innovations that might make a Frenchman faint: barbecued foie gras, foie gras pizza, foie gras quesadillas. 
 The opening of this pipeline can be traced largely to a former bond trader from Great Neck, N.Y., and an Israeli-born duck-breeding expert, who have teamed up to become the largest producer of fresh foie gras in the United States.
The two men, Michael A. Ginor and Izzy Yanay, own and operate Hudson Valley Foie Gras and Duck Products, a 200-acre farm in Sullivan County, two hours northwest of Manhattan. They also operate two 100-acre farms in nearby White Lake, N.Y., and another 100-acre farm outside Montreal.
Their company, formed almost eight years ago, is one of only two in the country that produce fresh foie gras; the other, Sonoma Foie Gras, is in California. Hudson Valley Foie Gras estimates that it produces about 80 percent of the product made in the United States.
"We did it because I could never get it here, and when I did, it wasn't any good," said Mr. Ginor, 34, the company's president, who first tasted foie gras 15 years ago as a college student outside Tel Aviv, where cubes of low-grade foie gras were served grilled and skewered, on a plate with hummus and pita.
David Waltuck, chef and owner of Chanterelle in TriBeCa, said his restaurant would probably not be serving foie gras if Hudson Valley had not started up. "The stuff from Hudson Valley is the best," he said.
To become the kings of foie gras -- they sell 220 tons a year of livers as yellow as the cornmeal they feed their hybrid ducks -- Mr. Ginor and Mr. Yanay, the general manager, have had to surmount several problems that had long held back the industry.
For decades, disease has stymied large goose farms in the United States and in Europe, and to many Americans, foie gras still means goose. Today, however, goose foie gras (foie gras d'oie) is only made in very small quantities in Israel, Hungary and parts of the Perigord and Alsace regions of France. Everywhere else, foie gras comes from a duck (foie gras de canard), mostly the moulard duck.
Besides disease, geese have a number of other problems. They are, some experts say, more intelligent than ducks, which means they will not take food from a stranger, making force-feeding more difficult. They have more fragile necks, another obstacle to feeding. And the rest of the goose ages faster than the liver, rendering the breast and other parts inedible, and making the process uneconomical.
Goose liver also contains a high percentage of fat, so it can be cooked only at low temperatures. "If you are making a terrine, goose is fine, but if you sear it, saute, broil, grill, the goose disappears and you are left with fat melted in the pan and liver," Mr. Ginor said. "Americans are inherently more comfortable with those cooking methods. Like cooking hamburgers."
As for duck foie gras, efforts to use Muscovy ducks have not been economical, because they usually breed only six months of the year, require lots of care and, to a lesser degree, have the same melting problem as geese because of their high-fat livers.
In the late 1970's, though, Mr. Yanay, an expert in poultry production who was then working in Israel, made a breakthrough. He developed an artificial insemination method to cross large numbers of female Pekin ducks with male Muscovy ducks to produce disease-resistant, but sterile, moulards.
The result was that birds with some Muscovy duck characteristics could be bred year-round in large numbers. Better yet, the moulard foie gras is easier to cook than goose or Muscovy foie gras. It is also, many say, more flavorful than foie gras from a Muscovy duck.
"The moulard is so perfect for foie gras production," Mr. Ginor said, "that 70 percent of the livers harvested in the world now come from moulard, including most of those in France."
The only trouble with the moulard, and the main reason no one has yet duplicated Hudson Valley's efforts in the United States, is that artificial insemination on a large scale is not easy. But that is Mr. Yanay's expertise. "What we do here, nobody else here can do," he said.
On the way to meeting in the Catskills and changing the course of foie gras history, Mr. Ginor and Mr. Yanay, coincidentally, both spent time in Israel.
Mr. Yanay came to the United States from Israel in the early 1980's. With some financial backing, he worked for a while with Commonwealth Farms in Ferndale to get a domestic fresh foie gras industry started. But acrimony developed before the industry did, and Mr. Yanay, 48, soon left the company.
Mr. Ginor, meanwhile, spent the 80's getting an M.B.A. from New York University and then made a small fortune as a bond trader and salesman at David Lerner Associates. He was born in Seattle, the son of a Boeing engineer, and raised in Israel and on Long Island. After a few years on Wall Street, he began searching for more meaning (and, apparently, danger) in his life; he joined the Israeli Army. Upon returning to the United States with dual citizenship in the late 80's, he decided that instead of merely harvesting money each day, he wanted a passion.
"I'm a foodie," he said recently, a few days after his return from a food and wine tour of South Africa. "I made a lot of money in the 80's, and I decided I wanted to do something that I really love, which was work with food. Now, I am almost a celebrity. I have a foie gras cookbook coming out. I'm opening two restaurants. I love the business."
His decision to concentrate on foie gras came after he ate what he said was particularly awful foie gras in an appetizer at the Cafe Rakel in Manhattan in 1989. A complaint to the chef led him to the owners of D'Artagnan, a wholesaler of game and meat products in Newark. They referred him to Mr. Yanay, who was driving a truck after his departure from Commonwealth Farms.
Upon learning about Mr. Yanay's skill and after researching the state of the domestic market for fresh foie gras, Mr. Ginor formed a partnership with Mr. Yanay in 1990. Mr. Ginor and a relative anted up $1.3 million to buy an old chicken farm not far from Commonwealth Farms, which they later bought for $1.4 million in 1992. Mr. Ginor also hounded chefs across the country to try his product, and established links with D'Artagnan and eventually 73 other wholesalers.
In 1993 and 1994, he fended off letter-writing campaigns and demonstrations by animal-rights activists smeared with red paint, who cited foie gras as one of the most cruel animal food products because of what the French call gavage: forcing the birds to swallow up to a pound of feed through a tube three times a day so that their three-ounce livers grow to as much as 12 times their normal size.
Mr. Yanay says the treatment of the ducks is no crueler than many other things done to animals raised and killed for food. He also says that the birds naturally overeat before they migrate and that their esophaguses are calcified, so the funnel and tube used for feeding are not seriously abrasive.
The lambasting by animal-rights activists apparently has had little effect on aficionados of fine food. So popular has fresh foie gras become that earlier this year Hudson Valley was sold out of product, leaving chefs screaming for more foie gras.
"A shortage?" said Mr. Waltuck of Chanterelle. "It was a complete lack."
Since then, the farm has increased production, and Hudson Valley now sells 220 tons of foie gras a year, an average of 7,500 pounds of liver each week, up from 2,700 pounds in 1992 (the average liver weighs about 1.5 pounds). The company's annual sales of all its products total $9 million, and pretax profit margins are 18 percent.
Hudson Valley gets about $50 for all the parts of each bird it sells to its 75 wholesalers; the liver alone fetches about $28 to $36 a pound, depending on the grade. Byproducts include the breast, which is called a magret; the legs, which are used for confit; feathers for down; tubs of duck fat for cooking or, for French-food devotees, spreading like butter on a baguette; the skin for crackling, and what the French call lardon, a pork-rind-like snack.
"We sell everything but the quack," Mr. Ginor said.

HEADLINE: Business Group Fails to Mollify Giuliani

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Determined to clamp down on the business group that oversees sanitation, security and other services in the Grand Central Terminal area, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that the group must do more than change its leadership to stay in operation.
His comments came less than an hour after the group, the Grand Central Partnership, announced the resignation of its president, Daniel A. Biederman, and the replacement of its chairman with Bernard H. Mendik, an ally of Mr. Giuliani. 
 The departure of Mr. Biederman was a stunning turnabout for a man who was once hailed as an architect of public-private partnerships, and who has been given substantial credit for helping to clean up midtown Manhattan during a time of economic straits.
But those changes in leadership did not seem to appease the Mayor, who has sought to curb the powers of business improvement districts, which collect assessments in return for providing supplemental services, including street lighting, security and garbage pickup.
Mr. Giuliani has questioned the financial operations of the Grand Central Partnership, whose record of success during the last decade has inspired imitators in cities across the country. In July, he cut off funds to the district and refused to renew its contract, complaining that Mr. Biederman, a onetime ally and the group's president, had created a fief by heading two other midtown BID's at Bryant Park and 34th Street and receiving a combined salary of $350,000.
Yesterday, he suggested that the Grand Central Partnership had no future. "They're all finished," Mr. Giuliani said yesterday morning of the group and its leadership. "Somebody has to come in and look over their books, their records, their accounts, and find out how they spent money."
The Mayor has raised questions about the Grand Central Partnership's $30 million bond debt, and whether the city would be liable for repayment in case of a default by the district. He has also sought to determine whether the three districts headed by Mr. Biederman had wrongfully mingled funds raised by their assessments. Mr. Biederman and district officials have denied any wrongdoing.
Later in the day, City Hall issued a statement that seemed to temper the Mayor's remarks, but stopped short of saying the partnership was back in business. "Today's developments at the Grand Central Business Improvement District are a positive sign and the administration is encouraged by them," the statement said. "The important thing for the city to do now is determine whether the structure and the finances of the organization are sound."
A director of the group, however, was discouraged by the Mayor's comments. "They're going to starve us to death," said the director, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Business improvement districts have proliferated in the city since the mid-1980's. As quasi-governmental institutions run by private businesses, the groups have the power to impose taxes on property owners to provide additional public services.
But the success of the districts and their increase in number have also left them in control of huge sums of money and services in the central business districts, stripping credit and accountability from City Hall.
The Giuliani administration had cut the lifeblood of the Grand Central Partnership in July by freezing $6 million in assessments and refusing to renew the group's five-year contract with the city. The city was able to freeze the money because it collects the assessments on behalf of the districts.
In a signal of the partnership's capitulation two months after vowing to fight the Mayor in court, Norman Sturner, the group's chairman, "nominated and appointed" Mr. Mendik to replace him at a membership meeting of the partnership yesterday. Mr. Sturner said he made the nomination because "the Mayor would like to see Bernie Mendik as interim chair." He then called for a vote of the members, who unanimously approved Mr. Mendik.
Mr. Mendik, a co-chairman of Vornado Realty Trust, a publicly traded real estate company, did not attend the meeting. Mr. Biederman will be replaced as president by Lowell J. Tooley, vice president of operations for the BID's at Grand Central, Bryant Park and 34th Street.
The city has demanded that the three districts, which share staff, computers and some office space, begin to operate separately, a condition that district leaders have argued will cost them more than $2.5 million a year just in personnel costs.
At the meeting, Barbara Wolff, an assistant commissioner at the city's Department of Business Services who has been in talks with the partnership, told the group that the new appointments would allow the two sides to resume talks about renewing its contract. But Jack Deacy, a spokesman for the Giuliani administration, later said that Ms. Wolff was "premature in declaring that the city would reopen negotiations."
Although the Giuliani administration imposed new rules this year barring anyone from serving as president of more than one improvement district, Mr. Biederman has not resigned from either the 34th Street Business Improvement District or the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, whose contracts with the city run until 2001. Both groups declined to comment last night.
Mr. Biederman, who declined to be interviewed, issued a statement saying that he was proud of his role as a founder of the partnership in 1988 and in helping to "greatly reduce crime by building $25 million of beautiful capital improvements on streets and sidewalks."
Many members of the Grand Central group say that the long-running dispute with the Giuliani administration has been dispiriting.
"It doesn't feel good, or taste good," said William G. Cohen, the executive vice president of Newmark & Company Real Estate and a board member. "Is Dan guilty of a crime? No. Has the neighborhood benefited from the BID? Yes. Dan Biederman was a great leader. It was his life's work."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Stocks Surge As Fed Offers Hint on Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks surged 3.26 percent yesterday, as Federal Reserve officials hinted strongly at an interest-rate cut, perhaps next Tuesday, to arrest a global economic skid that is threatening to turn into a worldwide recession.
More than half the market's gain came in the final hour of trading, after Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, who disappointed markets last week by saying no international plan for a coordinated rate cut was being developed, renewed investors' hopes. 
 "Deteriorating foreign economies and their spillover to domestic markets have increased the possibility that the slowdown in the growth of the American economy will be more than sufficient to hold inflation in check," Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee this afternoon. "I think we know where we have to go."
He indicated a cut would be considered at a meeting Tuesday of the central bank's policy-making committee.
Earlier, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William McDonough, made similar, though less pointed, comments about risks to economic growth to reporters in London.
The Dow Jones industrial average raced 257.21 points to close at 8,154.41. The advance was the average's fifth-biggest point gain on record, but it was not close to a record in percentage terms.
The Dow's advance above the 8,000 mark yesterday put it at its highest level since it plunged 512.61 points on Aug. 31. It had peaked nearly 1,200 points higher on July 17, but most other stocks had begun falling long before then.
Stocks also powered to strong gains across Europe, with main indexes up 3.82 percent in Germany and more than 2 percent in Britain and France. Brazil's market, highly volatile of late, soared nearly 11 percent on brightened prospects for aid, while Mexican stocks jumped more than 9 percent. Japan's stock market was closed for a holiday. At the midday recess today, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 379.31 points, or 2.75 percent, at 14,169.12. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was 3.28 percent higher in early trading.
Although the rally here was broadly based -- gainers swamped losers among the Standard & Poor's 500 by 420 to 14 -- financial, oil and Internet-related stocks were particular standouts. Analysts also pointed to what they said was a now clearly established preference among investors seeking bargains among smaller companies.
"They got washed out very hard," said Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed in Kansas City. "People think they are getting value here."
The Nasdaq market, home to many small companies as well as some dominant computer and software issues, rose 3.68 percent, better than both the Dow and the S.& P. 500, which was up 3.54 percent.
Some of the most startling leaps were by the Internet stars Amazon.com, up 16 15/16, and Yahoo, up 14 15/16.
"The Internet stocks really got going," said Andy Brooks, head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. "Buyers are going after stocks that can move."
Citicorp, with major foreign exposure that pushed its stock as low as 83 1/2 recently, rebounded 10 3/8, or 11 percent, to 105 1/2, after the Justice Department and the Federal Reserve approved its $46.4 billion merger with Travelers Group, removing the last obstacle to the combination of a giant bank with a leading Wall Street and insurance firm. Travelers rose 3 9/16, or 9.1 percent, to 42 15/16.
Anthony F. Dwyer, chief market strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann, is one of the biggest bulls on smaller stocks, citing their superior rebounds from market declines. Using the Russell 2000 index as his gauge, Mr. Dwyer calculated a 46.2 percent gain over the six and a half months following recent bear markets, while the Dow climbed 37.9 percent over about 11 months.
"The bottom line is that the smaller-cap stocks outperform their larger brethren by close to 10 percentage points in a significantly shorter period," he said.
The big oil stocks, though, posted handsome gains yesterday, as crude prices appeared to bounce solidly off their lows. Atlantic Richfield rose 4 3/8, to 71 3/8; Mobil 4 5/16, to 79 1/4; Chevron 3 5/8, to 84 11/16, and Exxon 3 1/4, to 70 5/16. Schlumberger, whose business is oilfield services, climbed 3 1/2, to 52 7/8.
Drugs were another strong blue-chip group, with Pfizer up 5 1/16, to 106 1/2, and Warner Lambert up 3 5/16, to 78 13/16.
Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered decliners by 2,377 to 800, with 62 making new highs and 117 new lows.

Treasury Bonds Fall
By Reuters
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 9/32, to 105 3/32, yesterday, to yield 5.16 percent, in late trading.
Analysts cited asset reallocations out of bonds and into a rallying stock market, as well as prospects for lower short-term interest rates.
In contrast, two-year notes were up 4/32 , to 1011/32 , yielding 4.56 percent. "To hold on to two-year notes at these levels, you have to believe that the world financial crisis is going to continue," said Chris Rupkey, vice president and financial economist at Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi.
He predicted the Federal Reserve would ease interest rates by a quarter percentage point, noting that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had warned "that deflation from the Far East is heading our way and that it will slow the economy more than would have been expected."
The Treasury sold $15.0 billion in two-year notes at a high yield of 4.615 percent yesterday.
Five-year notes were up 11/32, to 103 13/32, to yield 4.47 percent. Ten-year notes advanced 10/32, to 107 13/32, to yield 4.66 percent.
At the short end of the maturity range, three-month bill rates were down 12 basis points, or hundredths of a point, to 4.55 percent, and six-month bill rates were off 14 basis points, to 4.51 percent.
Following are the results of the auction of two-year notes:

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Seeing a Fund as Too Bigto Fail, New York Fed Assists Its Bailout

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has helped organize the rescue of a large and prominent speculative fund, indicating that regulators recognize that the failure of such a fund would damage already fragile world markets.
Under an agreement reached late yesterday, the fund, Long-Term Capital Management L.P. of Greenwich, Conn., received a cash infusion of more than $3.5 billion from a consortium of commercial banks and investment firms. The fund, whose founder is John Meriwether, a former vice chairman of Salomon Inc., and whose partners included two Nobel prize winners, is said to be have a portfolio worth $90 billion. 
 The deal came after representatives of 16 banks and brokerage houses met at the offices of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in downtown Manhattan. It is extremely unusual for the Federal Reserve to get involved in the bailout of such a fund, known as a hedge fund, a virtually unregulated type of investment firm, which despite its name, speculates in high-risk trades in markets around the world.
A spokesman for the New York Federal Reserve Bank, the biggest of the Fed's 12 regional banks, declined to comment.
But the Federal Reserve Bank's actions show that regulators are deeply concerned about the impact that a liquidation of Long-Term Capital's trades would have on brokerage firms and banks already struggling with huge losses from worldwide market turmoil.
Regulators in the past have encouraged creditors and borrowers to work together to avoid the kind of panic selling of a portfolio that could harm other investors in a particular market. For example, during the downturn in real estate in the early 1990's, the Fed asked banks to work with developers on the ropes. After the stock market crash in 1987, the Fed made capital available to securities firms that might have been on shaky ground.
For the Fed to get involved with a speculator like Mr. Meriwether is an indication that this time around, the asset of greatest concern is not commercial real estate or stocks. This time, it is bonds.
Long-Term Capital has been hurt by the same market developments that have led to losses at many investment firms. As turmoil in Russia grew, culminating with the country's de facto default on some debt and its devaluation of the ruble, investors fled risky securities. Many took refuge in the United States Treasury market, where prices surged, driving yields to record lows.
This confluence of events hurt Mr. Meriwether, who had been a big buyer of riskier bonds; adding insult to injury, the firm had also sold Treasury securities as a hedge for its non-Treasury bond holdings. When Treasury prices rose, Mr. Meriwether wound up on the losing end of both sides of his trades.
And like many hedge funds, Long-Term Capital made its bets on borrowed money. At times, the value of its positions exceeded its capital by 50 or 100 times. Recently, for example, Mr. Meriwether's firm was said to be holding positions worth $90 billion, while its capital stood at $2.3 billion.
The Fed may have been prompted to act quickly on Long-Term Capital's problems because it realizes that many of the world's hedge funds and most of the big brokerage houses have billions of dollars in trades on their books that are identical to those skewering Mr. Meriwether.
"The Fed is aware of the precarious position that exists among the largest dealers who have positions in virtually every fixed-income product versus Treasuries," said one trader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "If Long-Term Capital had to take off its trades, all the hedge funds and dealers would be killed."
Why? Because having a seller liquidating billion-dollar positions in these markets would drive them even lower than they now are. This could cause other failures among hedge funds and make dealer firms' losses increase, causing another wave of selling.
Even without panic selling, things have been bad for Long-Term Capital since August. At the beginning of the year, the firm had around $4.8 billion in capital. By Sept. 2, that capital had dwindled to $2.3 billion.
His losses rising, Mr. Meriwether wrote a three-page letter to his investors. He explained that his fund was down 44 percent in the month of August alone and was off 52 percent for the year. Some 82 percent of the losses came in so-called relative value trades, a specialty of Mr. Meriwether's, which identify small price differences between, say, a futures contract on a particular bond and the security itself. The remaining 18 percent was lost in trades in which Long-Term bet on a certain issue, up or down. Included in this group were losses in emerging markets, including Russia.
In the letter, Mr. Meriwether affirmed his belief in the trades his firm had made. He asked investors to consider making additional investments to the firm. By all accounts, no one did. Indeed, at about this time, the firm went to Soros Fund Management asking for an infusion of $500 million. The request was denied.
In the weeks since Mr. Meriwether wrote his letter, the market has hammered Long-Term Capital relentlessly. Treasuries have kept rising and all other debt has continued to lag. Even if he did not try to liquidate some of his trades, having to assess the value of his portfolio each night, as all funds are required to, meant that he did need to put up more capital.
It was no surprise, then, that in recent days, bond traders have suspected Mr. Meriwether and his associates of trying to unload some of their holdings to meet margin requirements. Last Friday, for example, Long-Term Capital bought a number of Treasury futures to liquidate one side of a huge trade. The buying moved the spread between the futures and the so-called cash market in that particular issue by one-quarter of a point, an enormous move in the world's deepest, most liquid securities market.
Terms of yesterday's bailout were not given. But bankers say that the institutions -- including Goldman, Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, J. P. Morgan, Chase Manhattan and UBS of Switzerland, among others -- agreed to put up roughly $250 million each in return for an equity stake in Long-Term Capital.
It is believed that existing equity holders, also known as limited partners, would end up with a greatly diminished ownership in the firm, between 10 and 20 percent of their original stakes. A spokesman for Long-Term Capital declined to comment on yesterday's developments.
Mr. Meriwether, of course, has faced adversity before. He left his position as vice chairman of Salomon Brothers in 1991 after Paul Mozer, one of the firm's Treasury traders, was caught trying to corner the market in two-year Treasury securities. Mr. Meriwether formed Long-Term Capital in 1994, along with the Salomon Brothers alumni Lawrence E. Hilibrand and Eric R. Rosenfeld, and Robert H. Merton and Myron S. Scholes, both Nobel laureates in economics.
With its stable of star traders, Long-Term Capital attracted money from banks, brokerage houses and wealthy individuals, all of whom agreed to lock up their investments until at the earliest, the end of this year.
Even if Long-Term Capital rides out this storm, the world of hedge funds will probably never be the same. Many investors will likely flee all such funds, and regulators will probably scrutinize their operations a lot more closely. Mr. Meriwether himself will be under the scrutiny of an oversight committee appointed by the banks that bailed him out.

MCDONALD'S EXPECTS 13% TO 14% RISE IN SALES ABROAD

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The McDonald's Corporation said yesterday that it expected third-quarter sales outside the United States to rise 13 percent to 14 percent before adjusting for the strong dollar. That kind of growth, even in the face of economic instability in some regions, would exceed most analysts' expectations. The international outlook follows promises last month by McDonald's new chief executive, Jack Greenberg, that per-share earnings would continue to rise 10 percent to 15 percent annually for the next five years. McDonald's, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill., has more than 23,500 fast-food restaurants in 113 countries. Its shares closed unchanged at $56.50 in trading of 3 million.

Brewers Do Part in Sosa's Season

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE

 BODY:
THERE was a time when the familiar slogan in this bratwurst burg bragged about "the beer that made Milwaukee famous." But in baseball's year of the Great Home Run Race, Milwaukee is now known for the pitching staff that made Sammy Sosa famous.
With his two homers here yesterday for a total of 65, Sosa had hit 12 against the Brewers' staff this season. More importantly, he had tied Mark McGwire for the major league home run lead. McGwire went 1 for 3 with a single and two walks last night against the Houston Astros in St. Louis. 
 When Sosa was hitting four home runs in three days against the Milwaukee Brewers nearly two weeks ago, the Cubs slugger was asked what he thought of the Brewers' transfer to the National League this season after nearly three decades in the American League.
With his trademark smile, Sosa replied, "I think it was a very good move."
Very good for him, certainly.
Before yesterday's game, Sosa had been in an 0-for-21 slump since he had tied McGwire with his 63d homer, a grand slam in San Diego a week ago. McGwire had hit two more since then, and with only several days left in the season, the competition that had riveted fans throughout the summer appeared to be over.
But suddenly Sosa energized the race, slugging home runs in the fifth and sixth innings.
"I still think Mark will finish in front of me," Sosa said. "I have to give up and sacrifice myself to get on base. Mark don't have to go to the playoff. When you try to go to the playoff, you never think about home runs. I came back today and hit the ball; it's part of the game," he said. "It's a good sign. I feel great today. I feel patient. When I play like that, I have a better chance. Yesterday I use three bats, today I use one -- the good one."
"I have to say this is my lucky team," he said later, alluding to the Brewers.
But as a group, Sosa and the Cubs weren't feeling lucky. They lost, 8-7, in the ninth inning when three Brewer baserunners suddenly scored as left fielder Brant Brown dropped a fly ball that should have been a routine final out.
"What happened to Brownie can happen to everybody," Sosa said. "What happened today, just forget about it and keep going."
Sosa's first homer, off Rafael Roque in the fifth inning, floated into the right-field stands at County Stadium, 344 feet away. His second, off Rod Henderson in the sixth, soared over the center-field fence, 410 feet away.
Asked if he would trade the two homers for a victory, Sosa said: "Definitely. I care about winning. I care about the team."
But the loss, like Sosa's two homers, are in the book now. His 12 homers against the Brewers average one for each of the 12 games between the teams this season -- the highest per-game homer ratio against one team in major league history.
Lou Gehrig, the Iron Horse first baseman of the Yankees, hit 14 homers against the Cleveland Indians' staff in 1936 for the major league record. Joe Adcock of the Milwaukee Braves and Hank Sauer of the Chicago Cubs each hit 12 against one team in one season for the National League record -- Adock against the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1956, Sauer against the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1954.
But in those eras, teams played 22 games against each other team every season. Sosa hit his 12 against the Brewers in 12 games.
Sosa's homers also gave him 155 runs batted in. It's the fourth highest total in N.L. history, behind Hack Wilson's major league record 190 for the Cubs in 1930, Chuck Klein's 170 for the 1930 Philadelphia Phillies and Wilson's 159 in 1929.
But the number Sosa seemed more concerned with were the eventual number of dead and injured from Hurricane Georges in the Dominican Republic, where he grew up and where he returns each off season.
"I haven't heard anything," he said. "When we get to Houston tonight, I will make some phone calls and try to find out. It is bad.
"But maybe this," he said, speaking of his two homers, "helps them feel a little better."
As the Cubs departed for Houston and Friday night's opener of their season's concluding three-game series, Kerry Wood, their 21-year-old right-hander who struck out 20 Astros on May 6 to tie the major league record, was almost as much a part of their storyline as Sosa and Brown.
Wood hasn't pitched since Aug. 31, when he sprained a ligament in his right elbow. Now he may or may not return as a starter Saturday.
"Kerry threw the ball very well," said Jim Riggleman, the Cubs' manager, after Wood fired fastballs and a few curveballs for about 10 minutes yesterday. "We'll see how he feels tomorrow, but I'd say it's 50-50 at best that he'll pitch in Houston."
After his brief workout, Wood said, "I feel O.K., it's up to them." But even with the wild-card berth at stake, Riggleman and Ed Lynch, the Cubs' general manager, might decide not to risk reinjuring the golden arm that represents the future of the Cubs' pitching staff.
Kevin Tapani (19-8) will open for the Cubs against Mike Hampton (11-7). Terry Mulholland (6-5) is scheduled for Sunday against Shane Reynolds (19-8) unless he's needed in relief before that. The Astros won't use Randy Johnson until next Wednesday's division series opener.
If Wood doesn't return Saturday, Mark Clark will start against Jose Lima, who has surrendered two of Sosa's three homers against the Astros this season.
But no matter who pitches for the Cubs in Houston, their wild-card chances will depend on Sammy Sosa.
"If we make it to the playoff, yes, I will be happy with this season," he said. "But if we don't, I got to go home and sing the blues."

Environmentalists Vow To Fight Referendum

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A coalition of environmental groups pledged yesterday to oppose passage of a referendum asking taxpayers to bail out counties for debts incurred in the building of incinerators because, the coalition said, location of the trash burners in low-income neighborhoods amounts to environmental racism.
Dana Natale, an anthropologist at Montclair State University who surveyed the locations for the coalition, Reclaim New Jersey, said the incinerators were being built in areas where residents "tend to have low levels of education, poor economic conditions and high levels of minority residents." 
 The November ballot question will ask voters to approve using money from a 1980 bond issue to pay off debt incurred by counties to build the incinerators, which cannot compete in a trash disposal market that was deregulated by court decisions last year, said Madelyn Hoffman, director of the Grassroots Environmental Organization, a coalition member.
If approved, the initiative would pay off $180 million of the $1.6 billion in debt incurred by counties under now-defunct regulations intended to control the flow of solid waste throughout the state.

Tax Break Helps Sales

BYLINE: By Nick Ravo 

 BODY:
New York's fourth sales-tax-exemption week, held earlier this month, resulted in increased sales of 71 percent compared with a typical week in September at stores surveyed in the city, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said on Tuesday.
From Sept. 1 through Sept. 8, The 8.25 percent sales tax was eliminated for items of clothing and shoes priced under $500. During a tax-free shopping week in September 1997, when only clothing that cost less than $100 was tax free, merchants reported average sales increases of 48 percent. In January 1997, when the sales tax was not levied on clothing and shoes under $500, retailers reported average increases of 77 percent. 
 The city's Economic Development Corporation surveyed 125 New York City retailers with locations in all five boroughs to determine the impact of the sales tax exemption.
Another tax-free week is scheduled for Jan. 17 through 24. As during the most recent tax-free week, clothing and footwear under $500 will be exempt from sales tax.
In December 1999, New York State will eliminate its 4 percent tax and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 0.25 percent sales tax on clothing and shoes under $110. Municipalities will have the option of eliminating their sales taxes.

ANYONE who works in a cubicle knows that its shroudlike isolation bears no resemblance to real privacy. But it may come as a surprise that the people who design today's office systems agree that cubicles are long overdue for a makeover.
"When I think about having to go to a box every day and perform a job in one of those little spaces, it doesn't seem human," said Ross Lovegrove, a British designer who was asked by the Herman Miller company -- which introduced the precursor to the cubicle concept in the 60's -- to help give new life to the spaces where roughly 60 percent of America's white-collar work force toils. 
 The system that the design team developed, which looks in part like a marauding raptor, might have been conceived for Sigourney Weaver's console in "Aliens." It is intended as an antidote to the piles of cables snaking around workers' feet.
Inspired by the computer mantra "plug and play," it consists of components that build up from the floor, rather than cantilevering from shoulder-height panels. A slick shell of translucent honeycombed plastic, it stands on silvery birdlike legs that attach directly to floor tiles, integrating the floor into the structure and masking cables for the computer, telephone and lights.
The approach was to think inside out. "As we move further away from pencil and paper, the support technology needed to convey voice, power and data becomes massive," Mr. Lovegrove said. "The infrastructure of even 10 years ago can't handle it." The goal was to transform the cubicle into a thing of "lightness and grace," he said. The system is also a lot easier to break down and reconfigure, a priority for office managers reared on notions of "high churn" (turnover) and faced with good old downsizing.
The "privacy" this system will provide is open to interpretation: an assortment of ethereal cotton-spandex screens that flex like wings can be snapped in place to offer some semblance of visual and audio separation. (They look great, but will they do the trick when a colleague is ranting on the phone at a spouse?) And then there are the file boxes: stacks of perforated plastic that bear an uncanny resemblance to the milk crates that another generation used to store LP's.
Still a prototype, the product -- known informally as Emma, after a grandmother of someone on the design team's staff -- is a collaboration between Interface Architectural Resources, a carpet manufacturer, and Herman Miller, the second largest manufacturer of office furniture in the country and no stranger to office innovation since it introduced the Action Office in 1964. Mr. Lovegrove's partner on the team was Stephen Peart, a designer who lives near San Francisco.
The system was previewed in June at Neocon, the trade show for the commercial furniture industry. "Everyone was buzzing around saying, 'You've got to see it,' " said Shashi Caan, a senior designer at Gensler, an architectural interiors firm. "Functionally, it wasn't all that new. Conceptually, it was fascinating. By simplifying all the parts and pieces and letting them be the decorations themselves, it made a really strong statement."
Others were most impressed by the Legolike components, which can be built up to accommodate a single worker or a team. "It comes as close to real building blocks as I've ever seen," said Roger Yee, editor of Contract Design, a trade magazine. "All the parts are universal."
"It doesn't presume how you're going to use it," Mr. Yee said -- whether in a traditional office with freestanding furniture or in a cubicle arrangement. He said the system "is honest enough to say it doesn't know the shape of the office of the future."
But in a business bred on brown laminates, the translucent plastic -- inspired by "the economy of such natural structures as honeycombs," Mr. Lovegrove said -- raised the most eyebrows. Kent Gawart, a business development executive at Herman Miller, which hopes to introduce the system next year, said many people at Neocon thought the plastic "went way beyond being viable."
So it's back to the drawing board for a few more embellishments -- namely a nice mahogany desktop, the kind the boss always gets.

HEADLINE: Covering the Territory;
On the Web, Titans Battle for Turf

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER 

 BODY:
WHILE there are thousands of real estate sites on the Internet, a battle appears to be shaping up between two titans: Home Advisor, run by Microsoft, the mogul of cyberspace, and Realtor.com, which is operated by Real Select for the National Association of Realtors and is the leader in home listings on the Web.
Microsoft opened Home Advisor in July. Prospective buyers can troll electronic neighborhoods for demographic data, calculate how much house they can afford using specific information about a house they like and even get pre-approved for a loan. A prospective buyer can specify the type of house sought and receive an E-mail message when one pops up. 
 The problem is getting the house to pop up. Microsoft has 300,000 to 400,000 listings, compared with 1.3 million at Realtor.com, according to information supplied by the companies.
In a recent random test, Microsoft had no listings for three-bedroom, two-bathroom houses between $100,000 and $300,000 in Olathe and Overland Park, Kan., two of the fastest-growing communities in the Kansas City area. At Realtor.com, however, there were 31 listings for the houses of that size at $100,000 in Olathe alone.
In Houston Heights, north of downtown Houston, where the two sites were on more level ground, running a comparison became more interesting. At the outset, both sites provide the national average for mortgage interest rates. Last Friday, Realtor.com was advertising 7.05 percent on a 30-year-fixed mortgage, 6.81 percent on 15-year fixed and 6.19 percent on a one-year variable. Microsoft's rates were 6.56 for the 30-year, 6.24 for the 15-year and 5.48 for the variable mortgage. Representatives at each site said the differences in rates cited could be due to the use of different sources: Microsoft's Home Advisor uses information from an outside company; Realtor.com uses figures from the National Association of Realtors.
Realtor.com breaks areas down by state, city and ZIP code. Customers then say how much they want to pay for what kind of house, specifying the number of bedrooms and total rooms, age of the house and square footage. Customers can also specify things like the number of stories, accessibility for the disabled, central air-conditioning, fireplaces and lot features.
Using only the very basic limitations of three bedrooms and two baths with a price of about $200,000, Realtor.com listed 22 properties in the Heights. The basic format provided a picture (when available) and brief description. The houses that appeared ranged in price from $160,000 to $239,000, with more details on request.
Using the same limitations, Home Advisor came up with 15 listings. The initial listing gives the size of the house and price, with no address; by clicking, the house hunter gets more information. Home Advisor also locates the property on a map and provides basic demographic information on the area. Houston Heights, for example, was described as having a population of 32,271, an annual median income of $31,306, an average household size of 2.45 people and a median age of 34.3 years.
Realtor.com, which has been on line since 1996, has more than 1.2 million listings, about 95 percent of all listings nationwide, said Michael Keller, vice president for marketing at Real Select. The data, which are supplied by Multiple Listing Services, include 148 of the largest 150 markets. The site has 3.25 million visitors per month doing more than 65 million searches.
Realtor.com does provide neighborhood information and school reports, but they are done through private companies, which charge a fee. For $19.95, consumers can get five reports over a seven-day period on schools, crime and the environment. A buyer can get a credit report through the site in only 30 seconds, but it will cost $8, or $29.95 for a report including results from three major credit bureaus.
Microsoft, on the other hand, is going for the superstore approach. Its Home Advisor site has five key areas: How Much Can I Afford, Finding a Neighborhood, Finding a Home, Finding a Loan, and Offer and Closing. "We're the first to have all five of these area in an integrated fashion," said Ian Morris, lead product manager for Home Advisor.
Although other sites may link services together, Mr. Morris said Home Advisor was different because it brought the services together in one navigational scheme. So, for example, a buyer who finds an interesting house can go on to calculate what the monthly payment would be, using interest rates posted on the site. Although addresses in many cities are not posted, the house can be pinpointed on a map and distances -- say, to Grandmother's house -- can be calculated.
While the company offering reports on neighborhood crime statistics through Home Advisor charged $20 for a report, it was possible for a shopper looking for a house in Houston to type in an address and find out at no charge whether any convicted child molesters lived in the surrounding area.
ALTHOUGH praised for its innovations, the site has been criticized as being a vehicle for Microsoft to make money by charging companies to sell mortgages. But Mr. Morris countered that by charging its "lender partners" a fee, Microsoft was able to provide free home listings.
As for the number of its listings, Mr. Morris noted that Home Advisor had been on line for only a couple of months, while Realtor.com had been on the Net for a couple of years. He said Microsoft had "deals in place" that would result in its listings numbering more than half a million, with more being added all the time.
Another problem with Home Advisor was that it repeatedly disconnected during attempts to use it. The problem was reported to the company and appeared to be solved in later tests.
While Realtor.com and Home Advisor are attracting lots of attention, competitors like Home Shark -- which can search more than a million listings in more than 350 Web sites -- are giving them a run for their money. Home Shark, a company that specializes in discount mortgages on line, has created a site with many of the same special features as Home Advisor. Although it does not have its own real estate database, it uses Home Scout, a search engine that draws from other real estate databases. A search of Houston through Home Shark, using the same criteria as before, landed more than 1,000 matches. The problem was narrowing the search to a particular area within the city.
Many of the major real estate sites have similar features. Consumers should spend some time exploring various sites to see which format best fits their needs.
In addition, keep in mind that these sites are there to make money. While basic neighborhood and school information is available for free, fees are generally charged for more details or more contact information.
Here are a few more of the many real estate sites on the Web with interesting and valuable information:
 
www.homes.com Has listings from Homes and Land magazine, which publishes listings for thousands of communities where the publication is distributed; the site also includes lots of other information for home buyers.
 
www.homescout.com: Compiles listings from other Web sites and directories.
 
www.luxury-realestate.com: A trove of high-end properties, with more than 1,000 listings in 35 countries.
 
www.rent.net: Advertises more than 2.5 million rental properties in the United States and Canada. Also includes relocation resources.
If you look around these and other sites and don't find what you want, try a site for the town you're interested in or for a real estate agency.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH: JACK LENOR LARSEN;
A Life's Warp and Weft

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
JACK LENOR LARSEN was ready for his close-up.
"It's nun's veiling," he said of the sheer, black, collarless suit he was wearing that summer day, "designed by my friend Massimo Vignelli. It's cooler than cotton."
Mr. Larsen is a man of the cloth, but it's not like that. He is possibly the most accomplished textile designer living, certainly one of the most innovative and influential in the second half of the 20th century. With the success of several thousand fabric patterns behind him -- many as original as modern architecture -- he has been prolific and powerful in the design community. And through the collections that his travels inspired, the middle-class home and office have become conversant with vibrant traditions everywhere -- from Thailand to Kenya. 
 The handsome Mr. Larsen's life has also been a fabric of sorts, of acquaintance with the rich and celebrated, of social prowess and business sense that has brought him fame and fortune, taken him to six continents and led the fashionable world to his door.
Now, this month, at 71, he has published an autobiography, "Jack Lenor Larsen: A Weaver's Memoir" (Harry Abrams). Friends -- he has known everyone, from Marilyn Monroe to Frank Lloyd Wright -- have undoubtedly heard these stories at the table at Longhouse Reserve, his 12,000-square-foot home in East Hampton, N.Y., which is also an arts foundation and a 16-acre garden open to the public. Mr. Larsen spins a good tale.
Mr. Larsen doffs a hat -- a black straw Amish number -- and points inside to the label. "They're called Park Avenue, but they come from Muncie," he said.
Jack Lenor Larsen lives in East Hampton and on Park Avenue, but as he would have you remember, he is a weaver from Seattle. Born in 1927 to Danish-Norwegian immigrants from Canada, he still presents the simplicity of his Northwest background -- the warp to the weft of his sophistication, rooted in the Douglas firs and Olympic Mountains and glacial, salmon bays of Puget Sound. His father was a building contractor. Intrigued with design, Mr. Larsen studied architecture at the University of Washington. In 1945, there was great interest in crafts in the Northwest. The young designer took a weaving course that put his future in his hands.
"After two years of architecture, drafting things that would never be built, weaving felt good indeed," he recalled. "It had horizontals and verticals, like architecture, and was dependent on materials and light and shadow, but I had real yarns and real color and real structure."
Mr. Larsen also made the first of a life's work of influential friends, Chan Khan, born in Lima, the son of the Chinese Ambassador and the last direct descendant of Kublai Khan. Mr. Khan was exporting pre-Columbian textiles. Amazed by the beauty of their systems, Mr. Larsen decided to become a weaver.
Liberated by his decision, he moved to Los Angeles as part of a company of unattached young friends involved in art, design, music and dance. They roved the coast; Mr. Larsen wove cloth from pine cones and seed pods scavenged on beaches.
He met Dorothea Hulse, who owned Handcraft House, a custom weave shop and school to the stars. Home crafts were voguish in Hollywood in the 1950's; she gave him work teaching weaving. One of Mr. Larsen's students was Joan Crawford, not the first person one associates with home economics.
"She was weaving plaid suits for her children," he said. "She had burned out on another marriage and she decided, well, she still had children," he recalled with a sharp grin. "We took her at her word," he said of Ms. Crawford's role as good mother. "It wasn't the first part she had studied. But it was such a mask. She wore tremendous amounts of makeup and her personality was as covered up."
Mr. Larsen had a brief stint back in Seattle. He hung out his sign, "Jack Larsen -- Weaver," on his studio door. A woman brought him pants to mend. A professor from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., offered him work as a teaching assistant. Mr. Larsen stayed on as a graduate student, on scholarship.
"For designers, Cranbrook was a kind of Hollywood," he said. "We were 65 students in the academy, and there were 65 gardeners. They had just stopped shining the students' shoes."
He made himself known to Eleanor Lloyd Richards, who had taught there. "She was from a Dutch family that owned the Upper East Side," Mr. Larsen said. In 1952, when Mr. Larsen arrived in New York, Mrs. Richards wrote him a check to help him bring his loom and 40 boxes of belongings with him.
With his background in architecture and his enthusiasm for technology, the young weaver was gaining a reputation as a modernist -- innovating in a field that was barely there: contemporary commercial fabric design. Modern architectural and interior design found themselves with an American audience in the 1940's and 50's, but there were few fabrics to fit the clean furniture or drape the picture windows. Mr. Larsen would create a strong market for them.
Invited to submit a design for a curtain for Lever House -- New York's first International style office building -- Mr. Larsen's entry, which was chosen, was a drapery of translucent lace woven with linen cord and gold metal, an exotic match of materials for which he would become well known.
By 1953, Jack Lenor Larsen was incorporated. "I had a Beverly Hills debutante as my weaving assistant," he said. "Neither of us had ever worked before." They hand-wove "shaggy" craft neckties, which found themselves noosed on New York's best-known necks, "the people I most admired," Mr. Larsen said, "like Sandy Calder and I. M. Pei and Leonard Bernstein." Florence Knoll, the modern design doyenne, who had turned down his portfolio in 1951 for being "too individualistic," commissioned furniture fabrics in a palette of olives and Spanish oranges that became the "avocado" and "harvest gold" of the 60's.
By 1954, he had a showroom on Park Avenue at 58th Street. Marilyn Monroe walked in with her decorator, shopping for the house in Connecticut she was setting up with Arthur Miller. Frank Lloyd Wright walked in, and walked out with 200 yards of a shimmering blue-green fabric for the music room at Taliesin. Wright was technically a rival. F. Schumacher & Company had introduced two lines of Wright's fabric design. It was understood among designers, Mr. Larsen recalled, that they had not been designed by Wright, but by stylists commissioned to produce Wrightian product. Mr. Larsen said: "Wright needed the money. He was such a spendthrift that he'd never paid his taxes."
As a weaver, Mr. Larsen had established a branch of architecture, the design of fabrics based as much on adventurous engineering -- pre-Columbian or postwar American -- as esthetics. "I like ancient techniques and the cutting edge," he said. "The extremes are always more interesting than the middle." On his loom, Mr. Larsen shuttled between the two.
By 1958, he had designed his first upholstery fabrics for airplanes -- Pan American's new 707 fleet. And he introduced the American public to their international neighbors, long before they became global consumers, through ikats and batiks that were previously familiar only to the privileged explorer. By 1974, Jack Lenor Larsen Inc. was producing fabrics in 30 countries.
Unlike world leaders, weavers understood each other -- by watching. Cloth was like an early map.
Today, Mr. Larsen's great love is home, which is largely Longhouse Reserve, completed in 1992 in collaboration -- their 30th -- with Charles Forberg, an architect. It is an imposing house on stilts, suggested by the Shinto shrine in Ise, Japan.
His collections of ancient and contemporary crafts, including textiles, ceramics and furniture, have followed him there and continue to grow, as does the garden with its art collection. Last year, he sold Larsen Inc. to Cowtan & Tout, a fabric and wallcoverings company; he remains a consultant.
"When I finished the house, I wanted to put an epitaph on it," he said. " 'To the Manor Died' -- I wasn't to the manner born." Mr. Larsen, leading a brisk tour through the garden (the briskest takes about 45 minutes) was debating the offer of a gift of Italian cypresses made to the foundation that morning. Past an allee of cedar trunks painted red, his parents' ashes under a fir leaf birch and a Buckminster Fuller open-air dome, lent this summer by his daughter, Mr. Larsen moved his small group toward Longhouse, a 180-foot-long building spread like a crane above man-made dunes.
Inside, Mr. Larsen did a quick walk-about in the living room, beneath its 65-foot skylight. Much of the foundation's loan collections are on display here. Then he strode the length of the house, past the center A-frame stairwell, with its two-story Dale Chihuly lizard-green glass pendant (it was Mr. Larsen who urged Mr. Chihuly, then a weaving student, to take glass-blowing lessons after he saw Mr. Chihuly's project of strips of woven glass) to the smaller, more intimate sitting room in Mr. Larsen's private quarters.
The peaked room is tented, in the style of Napoleon, in a Larsen fabric, "Canterbury," a Jacquard weave of Egyptian linen designed in the 70's.
"I'd hoped this tented ceiling and fabric walls would become a national trend," Mr. Larsen said. "It didn't."
The campaign-style room is neatly, snugly enfolded in Mr. Larsen's own personal collections. There is a Swedish ceramic stove, with two ebony Philippine armchairs before it. To the side is an 18th-century, painted-cloth Iranian camp table, which displays a box turtle shell found on the property and a 19th-century American patent ladder, which is used as bookshelves. There are five uncharacteristically delicate Edward Wormley tables and an important representation of pieces by Wharton Esherick, the dean of American craft furniture makers, including a side chair with a puzzle of miners' hammer handles fitted together to form the base. A pretty, varnished rolling table was his mother's. "Somebody made it in the Navy yard in Seattle, for cribbage," he said.
Many of the interior walls at Longhouse are sliding panels, stretched with fabric, a device based on a Japanese architectural element, the paper-panel fusama, which creates rooms and storage. An opaque, woven-leather cloth in the bedroom conceals clothes and bath towels; a sheer linen, threaded with hand-clipped Thai silk, showcases, in silhouette, shelves of ceramic collections. Other panels, rolled aside, reveal a short history of ceramics -- Yi-xing wine pots, Han Dynasty heads, a Dansk design of Mr. Larsen's and a vase by Dame Lucy Rie, the British studio potter, who was a friend.
Mr. Larsen picked the vase from the shelf, turning the milky ceramic in his hands as though it were a face he was trying to revolve into view.
"She became like an abbess, always in white," he said. "Frail, almost like blowing a dandelion down."
Mr. Larsen keeps his influences, experiences and memories on a shelf -- behind him, for others to admire. Weavers live for surprise -- that burst of firsts when paths intersect.
"I maintained the fantasy, until I was about 34, that I wasn't really working," Mr. Larsen said, composing a salad for lunch -- beets for color, walnuts for texture, string beans for structure and lettuce greens for form. "It occurred to me that I spent more hours doing what I did than anyone I knew. Other people would call it work. But I'm just playing very hard."

HEADLINE: Scholarships Provide Laptops Instead of Money

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
A NEW scholarship program at a California state college is one of the first in the nation to give students computers instead of financial aid.
By handing out $2,400 Fujitsu laptops to 40 incoming freshman, aid officials at California State University at San Marcos hope to narrow a technology gap among lower-income students that they think contributes to the low retention rate for first-year students. 
 "We have tremendous concerns with low-income students," said Paul E. Phillips, director of financial aid and scholarship at the campus, in north San Diego County, where, like elsewhere in the 22-campus system, about half of the students qualify for some financial aid. "We had students who had never turned a computer on."
Since faculty at the nine-year-old campus expect all of the 5,000 students to turn in assignments on computer disks or by E-mail, computer access is as much a requirement at San Marcos as textbooks and backpacks.
And while computers are available to students on campus, access may be impractical for those students who have family or work obligations.
Aid officials decided their resources would be most valuable buying PC's and software directly from a manufacturer and winning a volume discount. "We wanted to be sure they had every technological advantage they could to succeed," Mr. Phillips said.
Advocates for public access to digital services argue that the inability to harness technology's power will undercut economic and social advancement by the poor.
The San Marco laptop recipients are known as Evers computer scholars, named after their benefactor, the late Leonard Evers, a former resident of the region. He bequeathed $2 million for the college's needy students. The Evers scholars, selected from among 60 applicants with B average high school grades who also wrote essays, also are receiving $5,000 in monetary grants to cover tuition, books and some expenses. A full-time student's costs average $12,000 a year at a state college, which sets minimum entry requirements of grade-point average and test scores.
Besides the laptop, loaded with Microsoft's Windows 95 and Excel spreadsheet programs, the students also spent the first day of the semester learning how to click and close and dial up cyberspace under the tutelage of the campus computer-lab staff. While self-help with their own computer glitches is encouraged, the students also have been provided with a special call-in number for technical support. "They get V.I.P. treatment," Mr. Phillips said. They also get to keep the laptops if they graduate.
Mr. Phillips says it's too soon to look for results, although he is already hoping this year's laptop recipients become Evers scholars' mentors next year.
Financial aid experts say the unusual award at California State University at San Marcos is likely to be copied as a computer requirement becomes more prevalent at other campuses.
"Colleges that require computers, the cost is allowable as part of the expense budget," said John D. Joyce, a manager for the College Board scholarship service. He said the San Marcos program is the first he is aware of that defrays costs with equipment rather than cash.
Nationally, students borrowed 60 percent of $55.7 billion awarded in financial aid during the 1996-1997 year, the most recent figures available.

HEADLINE: Fed Chairman Renews Hopes For a Rate Cut

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, suggested today that the central bank would seriously consider cutting interest rates next week because of the deepening world financial crisis.
"We have to bring the existing instabilities to a level of stability reasonably shortly, to prevent the contagion from really spilling over and creating some very significant further difficulties for all of us," Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee. 
 His comments sent the stock market up strongly, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed 257.21 points higher -- a gain of 3.26 percent -- at 8,154.41, its strongest advance since the 512.61-point plunge Aug. 31. Page C1.
Mr. Greenspan, who as usual left himself some wiggle room, hedged his comments by observing that the American economy remains strong and unemployment low, a combination that would normally lead the Fed to worry about inflation. And in a nod to members of the central bank's policy-making committee who might be reluctant to cut rates when they meet on Tuesday, he emphasized that the decision was not his alone. Excerpts, page C3.
But in his clearest warning yet that the global crisis is threatening the nation's long economic expansion, Mr. Greenspan enumerated developments over the last several months that could slow growth in the United States. They included the decline in the stock market, a reduction in lending by banks and a general rise in uncertainty that could make consumers more cautious.
"I can't comment at this particular stage on what particular actions will or will not be taken," Mr. Greenspan said when asked about the possibility of a rate cut on Tuesday. "But I really would suggest to you that I think we know where we have to go."
The Federal Reserve has not cut interest rates since January 1996, when it reduced its short-term Federal funds target rate to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent. It raised the rate back to 5.5 percent in March 1997.
Economists said the central bank might still take only a half step when it meets Tuesday and adopt a formal "bias" toward an ease in policy, a signal that it expects it next move to be a rate cut.
But there was a feeling among analysts that Mr. Greenspan would make a strong case at the meeting for an immediate cut of a quarter of a percentage point and try to persuade the committee's more inflation-wary members.
"It means the odds now strongly favor him cutting rates on Sept. 29," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey Lanston & Company in New York. Economists said Mr. Greenspan previewed the argument he was likely to make to the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee in saying today that "deteriorating foreign economies and their spillover to domestic markets have increased the possibility that the slowdown in the growth of the American economy will be more than sufficient to hold inflation in check."
Mr. Greenspan has couched his increasingly explicit discussions of the rationale for a rate cut in terms of protecting the domestic economic expansion, which began in 1991 and has seen inflation almost erased even as unemployment has fallen to its lowest in more than 25 years.
But with much of Asia in recession, Russia in economic turmoil and Latin America increasingly at risk, industrialized and developing nations alike have been calling for a rate reduction in the United States.
A rate cut by the Fed could help the rest of the world by stimulating more growth in the United States, a major market for the goods and services produced in many struggling economies.
It could lead to a weaker dollar and help encourage lower interest rates in other nations. That could help ease some of the financial pressure felt by governments, banks and companies that are struggling with falling currency values and debts denominated in dollars. And it could provide a psychological boost to financial markets, which have been looking to Mr. Greenspan for signs of leadership at a time when governments and international institutions have provided few answers.
"It's a way of saying we're going to do our part to sustain growth in our own economy at a time when the world is fragile," said Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney in New York. "Cutting rates in America doesn't solve the banking and debt restructuring problems of these troubled places, but you start to form a base for rebuilding confidence in the global economy and then hope everybody does their part."
Mr. Greenspan first raised the possibility of rate cut in a speech in California early this month, saying the United States could not expect to remain an "island of prosperity" at a time when much of the rest of world was struggling. Last week he said there was no prospect of a coordinated rate cut by the world's biggest industrial countries -- Germany's powerful Bundesbank had already signaled that it would not go along -- but again hinted that slowing growth in the United States might justify a policy easing by the Fed.
His wording today, however, was far more forceful than in his previous statements about the risks facing the world and American economies and his signal of an eventual rate cut considerably less veiled.
There are few signs that the crisis that began last year in Asia is subsiding, he said, describing the last several months as "the most recent, more virulent phase of the crisis." The problems in the rest of the world have "also been accompanied by a rising concern for risk in the United States," he said.
Through much of this year, Mr. Greenspan held off pressure from a number of Fed policy makers for an interest rate increase to head off inflationary pressures. Two of the committee's 12 members -- Jerry L. Jordan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, and William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -- voted last spring for an interest rate increase, and a number of others were leaning in that direction.
It is unclear how much opposition Mr. Greenspan might face to a rate cut now.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about remarks on Wednesday by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, referred incorrectly to the 257.21-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average that day. It was not the strongest advance since Aug. 31; the strongest was 380.53 points on Sept. 8. Wednesday's close of 8,154.41 was the Dow's highest close since Aug. 31.

HEADLINE: PAKISTAN PLEDGES A-BOMB TEST BAN IF SANCTIONS END

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 23

 BODY:
Pakistan's Prime Minister said today that he would sign a treaty banning nuclear testing within the next year, putting the onus on India to follow suit or be left with North Korea as the only nations refusing to curb their nuclear weapons.
But the Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, linked the decision to a lifting of the sanctions imposed on Pakistan after it tested nuclear weapons in May. 
 American officials said President Clinton told Mr. Sharif on Monday that there could be no general waiver of sanctions until Pakistan made a formal decision not to conduct any more tests of nuclear weapons.
Today Washington welcomed Mr. Sharif's announcement, made in a speech to the General Assembly, even though it was conditional.
Diplomats at the United Nations are watching to see if India makes the same gesture when its Prime Minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, addresses the Assembly on Thursday.
Mr. Sharif announced his decision only hours after a lunch meeting with Mr. Vajpayee, at which they agreed on steps to reduce tensions.
Pakistan's promise to sign the treaty is the first step toward ending the nuclear arms race in South Asia, which erupted in May when India set off a surprising series of explosions, embarrassing American intelligence officials and diplomats. Pakistan quickly followed with its own tests.
The United States and international lending agencies put sanctions on loans to both India and Pakistan after the tests, but the curbs have particularly pinched Pakistan.
For the past several months, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has been shuttling from New Delhi to Islamabad, trying to persuade Indian and Pakistani officials to follow up pledges not to conduct more tests by putting their signatures on the test-ban treaty within a certain time limit.
"The within-a-year part is something that Strobe has been working overtime to try and nail down," said Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a military research organization in Washington.
What Pakistan announced, he said, amounted to "a time-bound framework, a declaration of intent."
At their meeting today, the Prime Ministers agreed to resume high-level talks on the dispute over Kashmir, talks that have been suspended for more than a year. But Kashmir, divided between the two countries and not recognized by the United Nations as belonging to either, will be only one of a number of subjects on the agenda when negotiations open in mid-October.
The two leaders also decided to set up a "hot line" between them, improve transportation links and put an end to sporadic firing across the cease-fire line in Kashmir.
Mr. Vajpayee said the talks opened "a new chapter in Indo-Pakistani cooperation."
But neither leader showed any sign of budging from long-held positions on Kashmir's future, with Mr. Sharif renewing calls for the United Nations to get involved and Mr. Vajpayee refusing to condone any outside help.
India accuses Pakistan of arming and training rebels in the Kashmir Valley, a Muslim area that has been in revolt against Indian rule since 1989. Pakistan accuses India with repression and the deaths of thousands of Kashmiris under army rule.
"Disappearances, arbitrary arrests, summary executions continue to be daily occurrences," Mr. Sharif said today in his speech. "The nightmare of the Kashmiri people continues."
Before Mr. Sharif spoke, there had been reports in Pakistan that he would move closer to signing the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which Pakistan has always said it would not do until India signed.
Pakistan voted for the treaty at a United Nations conference in 1996; India did not. India tried to block approval but was overwhelmingly out-voted, and lost friends in the developing world.
Asked today if India is now ready to sign, Mr. Vajpayee told reporters they would have to wait until they heard his speech on Thursday morning.
Mr. Sharif's one-year time frame for signing the treaty was chosen because in September 1999, the nations that have adhered to the treaty -- 150 to date -- will meet to review it. The test ban will come into force then, but only if all 44 nations that are "nuclear capable" have signed and ratified.
The United States has signed the treaty but President Clinton has not yet sent it to the Senate for ratification.
Pakistan wants to be part of the 1999 conference to prevent the rules from changing if India holds out against the treaty.
Some nations have suggested that in order to avoid a slow death for the pact, it might be necessary to overlook India and North Korea and allow the treaty to go into effect with ratifications from only 42 nuclear-capable nations.
"Pakistan will oppose any attempt to change this fundamental requirement," Mr. Sharif said. "Such a change can only be made by consensus."
He also said that if India resumed nuclear testing, Pakistan would review its decision to join the treaty.
Despite all the possible pitfalls ahead, Pakistan's decision was welcomed today.
"Ever since the nuclear tests in South Asia in May 1998, I have consistently urged India and Pakistan to sign" the treaty, Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a statement. "The Government of Pakistan is to be commended for heeding the concern of the international community."
 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 25, 1998, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about Pakistan's offer to sign the treaty banning nuclear weapons tests referred incorrectly to the status of the treaty in the United States. President Clinton has indeed sent it to the Senate for ratification.

HEADLINE: Our Lost Best Chance

BYLINE: By James Traub; James Traub's books include "City on a Hill."

 BODY:
I spent the day The Videotape was released inside the bubble of New York University Law School's symposium on globalization. And a very pleasant bubble it was, with the First Lady and scholars and bankers and United Nations officials earnestly, even a bit piously, mapping a "third way" between laissez-faire capitalism and the welfare state.
Then, in the afternoon, President Clinton arrived, to talk about "Strengthening Democracy in the Global Economy" in a forum with three other heads of state and government. More genial blather, I expected. 
 But no; the President posed the hard questions the others had avoided. What kinds of problems are not amenable to "third way" solutions? How do you persuade a public, or a legislature, to deal today with a problem that won't surface for 10 years, like Social Security? The President even made Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, his trans-Atlantic soulmate, seem ever so slightly flashy.
On the way out, I asked a constitutional law scholar what he had thought. "That was the most intellectually serious President of my lifetime," he said. "And I can't believe we'll get another for a long time. What a waste."
That, I said, was exactly what I had been thinking. It must have been what many people at the symposium were thinking. What a pitiful waste.
At the reception afterward, the President stayed and stayed and talked and talked -- about the problem of the long term, about Kosovo, about anything. I had met him only once before, after a debate in New Hampshire in the fall of 1991, and then, too, he had stayed for hours, debating and delineating.
Some of the same forces of conventional opinion that ridicule Mr. Clinton now over his penchant for all-nighters and commons-room palaver fell hard for him then -- for his passionate engagement with the most serious issues, for his gift for posing complicated questions in the most lucid form. It seemed then that this man could break the ideological deadlock of left and right -- no one had yet coined the phrase "third way" -- and could instill in public life something of the intellectual vitality we associate with the Kennedy years.
And yet, the Clinton Administration has been haunted almost from the outset by the sense of wasted possibilities. President Clinton, unlike Prime Minister Blair, faced a hostile, highly conservative Congress. (At the reception, he said with a smile that at times he could see the merits of a parliamentary system.) Whatever might have been quickly disappeared with the failure of health care reform, the disastrous 1994 elections and the subsequent ascendancy of Dick Morris and "triangulation" -- a debased variation on the third way, in which the President reduced his ambitions almost to nothing.
Perhaps a different kind of man -- a man less intent on survival -- could have found a way to rally the nation to his side. Yet it is also true that the Republicans were determined to deny Mr. Clinton significant legislative victories.
But we didn't know then how profound the waste would turn out to be. After Monday's symposium, I came home, turned on the television and heard, "If the person being deposed kissed the breast of another person . . ." That's what it had come to. Democratization and the forces of global capitalism were inside the bubble, rarefied and faintly preposterous. The all-pervading reality was that the President was facing the prospect of impeachment for refusing to admit that he had touched Monica Lewinsky when she had touched him. And yes, of course, the President was very much to blame for the fix he was in. He shouldn't have done it, and he shouldn't have lied about it. But the world has not been kind to him. It has given him an avenging prosecutor, and a ravening media, and a Republican majority quietly sharpening its knives.
To Mr. Clinton's critics, it is obvious how history will apportion the blame for this colossal waste. But it isn't obvious to me.

HEADLINE: Money to Burn at the Pentagon

BYLINE: By Lawrence J. Korb; Lawrence J. Korb, the director of studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, was an Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration.

 BODY:
Ever since the Republicans took control of Congress in 1995, they have added money to the defense budget, over and above the Clinton Administration's requests. In 1995 and 1996, they raised the proposed level of defense spending by $20 billion. In 1997, as part of the balanced budget agreement, the Pentagon's five-year plan received an additional $17 billion boost. And because of lower than expected inflation, the Pentagon will have another $35 billion in purchasing power from 1999 to 2003.
As a result, defense spending is now only 12 percent below the average level from 1976 to 1990. Financing for training and operations is higher per capita than in the Reagan Administration. The United States spends more on defense than all of its declared or potential adversaries combined. 
 Yet this is apparently not enough for Republican leaders, now joined by the President.
During the summer, Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, wrote to Mr. Clinton and the Senate Armed Services and Appropriation Committees requesting an increase because "the military has begun a downward spiral." Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned that combat readiness was eroding quickly. The Under Secretary for Acquisitions said the Pentagon had become trapped in a "death spiral."
Until recently the President had responded to pleas for more money by saying that he did not want to renegotiate the hard-fought budget agreement. But this month, Mr. Clinton invited the Pentagon to provide him with a request for more money.
That would be a mistake. The problem is not lack of money or aging equipment. The problem is that those civilians who should be controlling the military are allowing the generals and admirals to unilaterally define the threat, develop the strategy and set criteria for measuring readiness.
Military leaders claim they need to be able to fight two major wars simultaneously without allied help. But the chance of two wars occurring at the same time defies history. Moreover, the military forces of Iraq and North Korea -- to cite examples of two countries we might be at war with at once -- are much less potent than they were in 1995. If anything, our advantage against them has grown.
Military leaders also claim that "peripheral" tasks, like peacekeeping in Bosnia, take money from their primary mission, fighting wars, and contribute to a decline in the troops' combat skills. Someone needs to tell the military that today peacekeeping is a primary mission.
True, the Pentagon's equipment is aging, but not for lack of money. It is aging because the Pentagon is buying the wrong weapons. The military behaves as if it is still in an arms race with the Soviet Union, buying $2 billion bombers, $3 billion submarines and $5 billion aircraft carriers.
One area where the Pentagon needs more money is for pay raises. Military pay is about 13.5 percent lower than comparable private sector wages, and with low unemployment, recruiting and retaining troops has not been easy. But that gap could easily be closed. Congress could switch the $5 billion it allocated for pork barrel Pentagon projects, which primarily benefit members' districts, to raise wages.
Both Congress and the President need to focus on the real threats to our security, including terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. That is the only way to find out how much the Pentagon really needs to do its job.

HEADLINE: ALBERT V. MANISCALCO, 90, a Staten Island Leader

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Albert V. Maniscalco, who was the Borough President of Staten Island during its dizzying shift from rural to urban borough, died on Sept. 2 at the Sisters of Charity Medical Center there. He was 90.
Mr. Maniscalco, a lifelong politician who joined a Democratic Party club at the age of 14, was Borough President from 1954 to 1965, a period in which the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was planned, built and completed. The bridge, which opened in 1964, brought a flurry of development that caused the population of the city's least populous borough to multiply and new neighborhoods to sprout like mushrooms in what had been farmland. 
Ada Louise Huxtable, the architecture critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1965 that development was racing forward on Staten Island with "a haphazard abandon that could not be better calculated to destroy the countryside if it had been planned by enemy action."
But she praised Mr. Maniscalco for delaying an urban renewal project that would have accelerated the damage. In essence, it would have involved putting a Manhattan-style street grid on the island. He also opposed running a parkway through land that became parkland.
The Greenbelt Conservancy, a private parks group, honored him for his role in saving land that eventually became an emerald spine of natural areas on Staten Island. Indeed, the term "greenbelt" was first used by Mr. Maniscalco at a meeting of the Board of Estimate.
Everyone called Mr. Maniscalco Al, although he was always careful to use the proper title of any person to whom he spoke. He was revered for his politeness, and he spoke a version of English that some considered rarefied.
Mr. Maniscalco was born in Manhattan in 1908, a fact he never tired of repeating in his public speeches. His family moved to Staten Island when he was 9. Five years later, he joined the South Beach Democratic Club and a year later was the club's secretary. He was particularly interested in helping immigrants achieve citizenship.
"While most kids were playing games after school I was hanging around Democratic meetings," he said in an interview in 1960.
He left high school to work as an engine cleaner for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, but later earned a bachelor's degree and a law degree by attending night classes at St. John's University. In 1938, he was elected to the State Assembly, and served for two terms. He then served as Borough Secretary under two borough presidents and on the City Council for one year before becoming Borough President.
He is survived by his wife of 62 years, the former Grace Fiorelli; a son, Dr. Albert M. Maniscalco of Staten Island; a daughter, Linda J. Calarco of Woodbridge, Conn., and four grandsons.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Resists 'Blackmail' by Russia and U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
A senior official of the International Monetary Fund warned today that he would neither submit to "the blackmail" of Russian leaders who threatened national default if they are denied billions of dollars in aid, nor let Congress "impose conditions" on the fund in return for $18 billion in new contributions from the United States.
The comments came as the I.M.F. is facing the most intense criticism in its 53-year history, accused of mismanaging the spreading global financial crisis and misjudging the political effects of its prescriptions. But the senior official, who refused to allow his name to be used, conceded no mistakes on the part of the institution during his 90-minute breakfast with a large group of reporters this morning in the fund's executive dining rooms, three blocks from the White House. 
 While the official conceded that the world economy is "in a mess," he insisted that it would not "fall into a world recession" in coming months. He also made clear that a financial rescue package now being assembled for Latin America -- chiefly to support Brazil -- would require direct contributions from major economic powers around the globe, including the United States.
So far the Clinton Administration has refused to discuss publicly whether it would agree to commit American taxpayer dollars to stabilize one of America's largest trading partners. Any such move would have echoes of the 1995 bailout of Mexico -- a decision President Clinton made in defiance of Congress, which overwhelmingly opposed the loans. While Mexico paid back the full $12 billion in loans, Administration officials are clearly hesitant about repeating the experience, especially at a moment Mr. Clinton is conserving every vote he can in Congress to ward off impeachment threats.
But the official noted that the Government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, who faces a national election in 10 days, has made no "formal" request for aid. But he said that "we go on assessing the situation to be ready when the need arises," a considerable understatement of the frantic series of phone calls being exchange among the world's finance ministries in recent weeks to stop the economic contagion from spreading to Latin America.
In recent days the leadership of the fund -- particularly Michel Camdessus, its French-born managing director -- has begun a public-relations counteroffensive against its many critics. The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, have referred to Mr. Camdessus as a "French socialist" who has squandered the fund's resources, and the House recently rejected an $18 billion payment of the United States' commitment to the institution.
Meanwhile, the I.M.F. has been on the defensive about its $4.8 billion aid payment to Russia in late July. No one can account for what happened to the money, which was intended to stabilize the ruble. Instead, it was lost in currency transactions after the Russian Government allowed the ruble to be devalued. The I.M.F. aid did, by most accounts, provide some extra time for the country's oligarchs to get their cash out of the country before the devaluation.
At today's session with reporters, the senior fund official reversed course and was sharply critical of Russia, making clear that the fund would not go forward with the rest of the $17 billion bailout plan it cobbled together in July unless Russia met the conditions of the loan. The new Russian Government, meanwhile, appears to be going the other way -- announcing plans to print money to dictate to its lenders when and how much they will be paid back.
"For the Government to be credible with the international community they must behave in a civilized way with their creditors," the senior official said. "Any kind of imposed solution for debt restructuring would be a mistake."
 The official also derided Russia's statements in recent days that it would resort to "controlled inflation."
"Controlled inflation reminds me of what Anglo-Saxon people call being half pregnant," the official said. "The I.M.F. does not like countries to be half pregnant with inflation. People don't want to be paid for their arrears in fake money."
The senior official emphasized that "we are talking with Russia" and "trying to obtain from the authorities clarification of their intentions." But he said that the "I.M.F. does not accept" efforts to "blackmail" the institution into providing more funds by threatening further defaults on international loans, an event that could set off more global market turmoil. He seemed to be referring to comments made earlier today by Russia's deputy Prime Minister, Aleksandr Shokhin, who said that if the fund delays additional aid it would "drive Russia into a corner."
The comments on reluctance by Congress to provide $18 billion in new cash for the fund -- part of a far larger financial pool supported by other countries -- seemed intended to signal that the United States' should ask for changes but not dictate them.
"The U.S. must bring its contribution," he said, "and no country is entitled to impose conditions."
If every country tried to do so, he said, "at the end of the day we would have so many conditions -- contradictory -- that the job could not be done." The official held out a small olive branch, saying, "I hear many things on the Capitol Hill which are music to my ears and which are already in the cooking here," mostly reforms that would require the monetary fund to make more data public about internal operations and about the countries it helps.

HEADLINE: G.E. Agrees to Clean Part of Tainted River in Massachusetts

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
The General Electric Company has agreed to spend $150 million to $200 million to clean up a contaminated stretch of river in western Massachusetts in a settlement that Federal regulators described today as a significant victory for the environment and a city.
In announcing the deal, the company and the Environmental Protection Agency said removing sediment laden with PCB's from an abandoned electric-transformer plant would rejuvenate a two-mile stretch of the Housatonic River and the city it flows through, Pittsfield, Mass. 
 The agreement apparently ends months of negotiations that began some two decades after industrialists and regulators alike recognized that PCB's, polychlorinated biphenyls, once widely used in manufacturing, were dangerous to human health and might cause cancer.
Carol M. Browner, who heads the environmental agency, said an economic redevelopment package that G.E. had agreed to as part of the deal would help return prosperity as well as environmental safety to Pittsfield, an economically ailing city of about 50,000 people in the Berkshires.
For its part, General Electric said in a statement by Stephen D. Ramsey, its vice president for corporate environmental programs, that it was "pleased to enter a new phase of investing in the future of Pittsfield and Berkshire County."
At first glance, the Pittsfield agreement seemed to invite comparisons with the environmental agency's continuing battle against G.E. over PCB contamination of the Hudson River from two abandoned plants in Fort Edward and Glens Falls, but people familiar with both cases cautioned that they were far from parallel.
They are vastly different in scale (2 miles of the Housatonic will be cleaned; some experts say about 40 miles of the Hudson should be dredged), and the Hudson River case is in a much earlier stage: the E.P.A. may not announce its long-range plan for cleaning up the river until December 2000.
The cost of the Hudson cleanup could be far higher if the most radical proposals, including dredging many miles of contaminated riverbed, are carried out. General Electric has insisted that leaving the tainted sediment alone might be safer than removing it.
The Housatonic was fouled around Pittsfield by a G.E. complex that opened more than a half-century ago, employed about 13,000 workers at its peak and closed in the early 1980's when the company quit making large electric transformers, company spokesmen said today. (General Electric has a separate plastics unit in Pittsfield that employs about 700.)
Company officials often point out that many companies used PCB's before their hazardous nature was recognized, and disposed of them in ways that were legal then, like letting waste flow into rivers. At Pittsfield, PCB's were used in liquid that seemed an ideal replacement for the flammable mineral oil, which was once used in transformers, said Bruce Bunch, a G.E. spokesman.
The Housatonic accord, which lawyers on both sides expect to be spelled out in a consent decree in Federal Court before winter, calls for G.E. to divert the worst stretch of river, a half-mile section that flows through the 250-acre plant complex, remove the tainted sediment and put the river back on its original course.
Tainted sediment will also be removed from a separate one-and-a-half-mile stretch downstream, though the environmental agency will bear some of that cost. G.E. has agreed to restore soil and vegetation to damaged riverbanks and to pay some $15 million to bolster the surrounding wildlife habitat. General Electric will tear down some buildings in the old complex and refurbish others before turning them over to Pittsfield for new development.
Mr. Bunch estimated the total cost to General Electric at $150 million, but an environmental agency official said it could top $200 million.
"If they can do it in less, God bless them," this official said.
The accord averted use of the Superfund law, under which the Government could have done the cleanup, then billed General Electric. John De Villars, the agency administrator for New England, said the agreement carried "a spiritual and psychic value" for all parties, one "that can't be quantified but is every bit as important as the substantial financial and economic factors."
But if this settlement produces good will, it seems likely to be tested. General Electric is liable for more than 70 cleanups under the Superfund law, including the mammoth Hudson River project.

HEADLINE: NEW DELHI PLEDGES TO SIGN WORLD BAN ON NUCLEAR TESTS

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 24

 BODY:
India joined Pakistan today in announcing that it is prepared to sign the international treaty banning nuclear testing within the next year, but said it is still discussing details with Washington.
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, said India had satisfied its security concerns with its nuclear tests in May and is ready to cooperate in bringing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty into force. 
 "We are prepared to bring these discussions to a successful conclusion so that the entry into force of the treaty is not delayed beyond September 1999," Mr. Vajpayee said. The Prime Minister, whose party is backed by Hindu nationalist organizations, spoke in Hindi, breaking a long tradition of Indian leaders who spoke in English at the General Assembly.
The Clinton Administration reacted cautiously to Mr. Vajpayee's statement today and to a similar pledge by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan on Wednesday.
"Obviously much remains to be done," Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright told reporters here: the actual signing and ratification of the treaty, the strengthening of export controls by both countries and other steps to bring India and Pakistan into full compliance with international arms control agreements.
If India and Pakistan carry out their pledges, North Korea will stand alone in refusing to sign the treaty, and its refusal could still prevent the accord from going into force a year from now, the deadline for ratification that was set by a United Nations conference two years ago.
At that time, India opposed the treaty and tried to block its passage. The Clinton Administration has been negotiating with India since then to change its approach.
Both Mr. Vajpayee and Mr. Sharif lead governments that are vulnerable to swings in public opinion fostered by their political enemies. Nuclear testing has been popular in both countries, and intentions stated here -- however qualified -- could unravel in the arena of South Asian politics.
India's scientific and nuclear establishment has a large stake in the weapons program there, as the Pakistani military does in Pakistan.
Forty-four countries with nuclear reactors must ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for it to take effect; 10 have done so. The United States has signed but the treaty is on hold in Congress.
Today opponents of the treaty accused President Clinton of bargaining away the sanctions on India for support for the test-ban treaty.
The sanctions suspended direct foreign aid, including Government loans and guarantees; canceled United States licenses to export arms to India; banned private American loans to the Indian Government, and require Congress to oppose aid channeled through the World Bank and similar groups.
Sanctions were also imposed on Pakistan, which followed India with tests of its own in May. On Wednesday Prime Minister Sharif of Pakistan tied the lifting of sanctions to his promise to sign the test-ban accord. Sanctions have hit Pakistan hard.
In a letter to President Clinton last week, three Republican Senators -- Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; Trent Lott of Mississippi, who is the majority leader, and Jon Kyl of Arizona -- said they opposed lifting sanctions as a price for adhering to nuclear agreements.
"As the recent Indian nuclear tests demonstrated, the C.T.B.T. is not adequately verifiable," they wrote.
Talks between the United States and India and Pakistan have been going on almost continuously since their nuclear tests. The Indian tests surprised and embarrassed the American intelligence services, and made tests by Pakistan virtually inevitable because of the rivalry between the two countries. Indeed, subsequent questions about the scale of the tests have suggested that their political weight exceeded their strategic value.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has been shuttling to various meetings with South Asian officials. As the talks progressed, arms control experts said, the bite of sanctions was beginning to be felt in India as well as in Pakistan, and both countries had reason to negotiate an end to their isolation.
Mr. Vajpayee said today that India had accepted the principles of the test ban treaty since its nuclear tests in May.
"After concluding this limited testing program, India announced a voluntary moratorium on further underground nuclear explosions," he said. "We conveyed our willingness to move toward a de jure formalization of this obligation. In announcing a moratorium, India has already accepted the basic obligation of the C.T.B.T."

HEADLINE: FALLEN STAR: THE MANAGERS -- An Alchemist Who Turned Gold Into Lead;
Financial Wizard Done In By His Smoke and Mirrors

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
When Salomon Brothers, the swashbuckling Wall Street firm of the 1980's, was raking in the money -- hundreds of millions, even billions, of dollars -- investors would grin at one another and say, "J. M.'s done it again."
"J. M." is John W. Meriwether, who, with a small and intensely loyal band of colleagues, turned vast profits by using complex trading strategies and huge amounts of capital to exploit price discrepancies in the world's bond markets. 
 Now, in perhaps the clearest sign to date of the current fragile state of global financial markets, Mr. Meriwether's latest bubble has burst. No longer at Salomon, he -- still pursuing his secretive strategies -- is at the center of a $90 billion storm, a storm that led to this week's $3.5 billion bailout of his hedge fund orchestrated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Those who put up the cash for this bailout -- a roll-call of Wall Street names like Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Goldman, Sachs and Chase Manhattan -- in return got 90 percent of Mr. Meriwether's company, Long-Term Capital Management of Greenwich, Conn.
Hardest hit are those at the eye of the storm: Mr. Meriwether, 51, and his colleagues. At the end of last year, the nearly 200 employees of Long-Term Capital held some 30 percent -- or $690 million -- of the hedge fund's $2.3 billion in capital, said Peter Rosenthal, a spokesman for the firm. And the bulk of that was held by Mr. Meriwether and his dozen or so partners.
With their stake slashed to about 3 percent of the newly capitalized company, the employees have seen their holdings shrivel to, at best, a little more than $100 million -- but even that could dwindle quickly unless the markets turn in their favor. According to some people familiar with the company, several junior employees had borrowed to finance their holdings.
It wasn't long ago that Mr. Meriwether and his colleagues were among the most fabled managers of hedge funds, those unregulated pools of capital that seek to offer rich investors rates of return undreamed of by small investors. The elite partners of Long-Term Capital include Myron S. Scholes, 57, and Robert C. Merton, 54, both Nobel laureates in economics; David W. Mullins Jr., 52, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Eric R. Rosenfeld and Lawrence E. Hilibrand, former Salomon bond experts. Mr. Mullins, when he was a Harvard professor, even served on the panel that investigated the October 1987 stock market collapse with an eye to preventing such events in the future. Now regulators will spend the coming months debating how to protect the markets from hedge funds.
In early 1994, Mr. Meriwether -- who had left Salomon after one of his traders submitted false bids at Treasury auctions -- turned to raising capital for his new venture. Many of the world's richest and supposedly smartest investors flocked to his doors, giving him $1.25 billion, then a record sum for a new hedge fund. The list of investors -- minimum stake: $10 million -- included such well-known investors as Banque Julius Baer, the private Swiss bank, a Paine Webber management compensation plan and the Bank of China.
Several of Mr. Meriwether's investors complained vociferously when, at the end of 1997, he and his partners insisted on paying back about $2.7 billion of their capital, saying the markets had gotten trickier. They returned all the money that had been invested after Dec. 31, 1994, and all investment profits made before that date.
Those investors, of course, "are feeling extraordinarily lucky and happy" now, said Antoine Bernheim, president of Dome Capital Management, a New York company that compiles data on hedge funds. "Those who received preferential treatment by getting less of their investment returned last year must be feeling very unhappy."
So how did this meltdown happen? How could some of the world's best-known bond investors, and some of its most famous economists and mathematicians, get crushed, and so quickly? The partners themselves are not talking publicly, but, sifting through the wreckage, a familiar theme emerges. It is a story as old as the history of financial debacles: a gradual loss of confidence, eventually cascading into a full-scale rout.
As the summer wore on, the financial markets became increasingly concerned about risk, particularly in mid-August, after Russia defaulted on billions of dollars of its obligations. The financial institutions involved with Long-Term Capital -- whether lending it money, investing in it, or clearing its trades -- started getting nervous. They gradually came to believe that the ambitious financiers at Long-Term Capital might not have enough money to support their complex network of obligations in the world's markets, mainly in three areas: mortgage bonds, European government bonds and bonds issued by Russia and other developing countries. The hedge fund also bet that interest rates would rise in the Treasury market.
Events were playing havoc with Long-Term's strategies, causing the world's nervous investors to rush to buy the highest-quality securities, like Treasury bonds and German Government bonds.
But Long-Term Capital, according to those on Wall Street familiar with aspects of its business, had made heavy bets that interest rates throughout Europe would move closer together as many of its nations moved toward monetary union. And now, with investors suddenly more eager to buy Deutsche mark bonds, the "spread" between German and, say, Italian Government bonds widened rapidly -- precisely what the firm had bet against.
"There was a perception that there was not enough of an equity cushion underneath the positions," said a person familiar with the fund's business, who declined to be identified. "Very often in these markets perception becomes reality."
And the perception has gotten worse. Yesterday, one of Mr. Meriwether's oldest colleagues even asked whether the stories of personal bankruptcies at Long-Term Capital were true. Mr. Rosenthal, the spokesman, dismissed such questions.
Still, Mr. Meriwether and his colleagues have seen most of their wealth evaporate in a few frantic weeks, and this week they were forced to accept the terms imposed on them by their rescuers. Many on Wall Street also predicted that the fiasco at Long-Term Capital would probably mark the end of Mr. Meriwether's financial prominence, and that of many of his colleagues.
In the past, Mr. Meriwether has made some remarkable returns for his investors and for himself. In 1995, for example, the fund returned almost 43 percent after allowing for its 2 percent annual management fee and the fund managers' taking 25 percent of all profits under their agreement with investors. It is not clear how much Mr. Meriwether took out in profits over the years and how much of his wealth he kept in the fund.
Astonishingly, perhaps, some investors in Long-Term Capital may not have lost money even after this meltdown, Mr. Rosenthal, the fund's spokesman, said. Assuming an investor put in money only at the fund's birth, in early 1994, and took all the profits paid out through the end of last year, that investor would still have made a return of some 17 percent, he said, citing calculations by executives at the fund's offices.
Despite this record, many doubt whether Mr. Meriwether can bounce back for a second time after such a spectacular fall. In 1991, he lost his job as vice chairman -- and heir apparent -- at Salomon Brothers when it became clear that Paul Mozer, one of his subordinates, had submitted false bids at Treasury bond auctions. That scandal threatened to end his career, but Mr. Meriwether survived to bring his talent to Long-Term Capital.
The very scale of this latest fiasco is also likely to make it harder for Mr. Meriwether and other hedge fund managers to pursue such aggressive strategies again.
"Situations like this could have the adverse effect of regulators beginning to scrutinize hedge funds," said Holland West, a partner at Shearman & Sterling who specializes in derivatives and hedge funds. "Some of the financial institutions that are involved are going to be doing more and more scrutinizing and credit analysis."

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration played down today the potential risks to the financial system from Long-Term Capital Management L.P.'s brush with collapse, but the fund's fall raised questions in Congress about whether regulators can keep up with the increasing complexity and speed of the markets.
A day after helping big banks and investment firms work out a rescue package that will give Long-Term Capital some time to deal with its financial problems, the Federal Reserve emphasized that it had not put any taxpayer money into the deal. 
 Moreover, Fed officials said, the deal calls for Long-Term Capital's owners to suffer potentially substantial losses from their investment strategies gone wrong. As a result, they said, the deal was not a bailout and should not be seen by investors as a sign that the Government was willing to protect investors from their mistakes.
Still, at a time of instability in markets worldwide, the episode was seen by some members of Congress and economists as a new application of the "too big to fail" doctrine, under which regulators take steps to keep institutions afloat because allowing them to collapse would drag down other firms and endanger the entire financial system.
"It would appear that Long-Term Capital Management was deemed by the Federal Reserve to be too leveraged and too intertwined to fail," said Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the House Banking Committee. "The question that remains for the economy is what other risk exists in the hedge fund and derivatives industry."
Congressional aides said that discussions were under way about holding hearings into Long-Term Capital's problems, and the more general issue of the complex, risky investments made by hedge funds, but that no decisions had been made.
Among the issues certain to be debated is whether the Fed, by using its influence to help keep Long-Term Capital afloat, was sending big investors a signal that it will provide a safety net when they are at risk of suffering huge losses.
"Why should the weight of the Federal Government be brought to bear to help out a private investor?" Paul A. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman, said in a speech in Boston today, Bloomberg News reported.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, was kept apprised of the talks on Wednesday but played no active role in the negotiations, which took place at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The New York Fed takes the role within the Federal Reserve system of monitoring financial markets and had been tracking Long-Term Capital's condition for several weeks, officials said.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said today that he had no concerns about any broader fallout. "The only issue that I have to worry about are issues that have systemic effects, that can affect the overall economy," Mr. Rubin told reporters. "I believe the system can handle everything I'm aware of" relating to Long-Term Capital's problems.
But there were indications that Fed officials were concerned that the incident would create a further perception of risk within the financial markets, exacerbating a developing credit squeeze and further slowing the economy.
Even as Long-Term Capital was hammering out a deal with its creditors, Mr. Greenspan was telling the Senate Budget Committee that the global crisis had become "more virulent" in recent weeks, with direct effects on the American markets.
Peter Bakstansky, a spokesman for the New York Fed, said it was wrong to characterize the situation as an application of the "too big to fail" doctrine, especially since no Government money was involved and the Fed's only role was to bring Long-Term Capital together with its creditors. But he said the Fed had to be aware of potential "disruptions" to the market.
"These situations are learning experiences, and we're looking at what we can do effectively in the context of our responsibilities," Mr. Bakstansky said. "We're not assigned to set margin requirements for the bond markets. We don't have regulatory authority over offshore hedge funds. But we do have responsibility for the safety and soundness of the banking system."
Robert E. Litan, the director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said it was hard to evaluate the Fed's approach to Long-Term Capital without knowing more about the investment firm's positions -- always a problem with hedge funds, which are largely unregulated and operate in considerable secrecy.
"The whole premise of hedge funds -- the reason they're not subject to regulation -- is that they are limited to very large investors and that the creditors to them are big boys who are supposed to be able to take care of themselves," he said. "This may cause policy makers to revisit that assumption. Maybe one outcome of this will be more data collection."

HEADLINE: World Trade Center Goes Up for Lease

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
The Port Authority board voted unanimously yesterday to put the World Trade Center up for long-term lease, and several major real estate figures have already expressed interest in becoming the new landlord of one of the world's most prominent properties.
"I would be interested," Donald J. Trump said. "It depends on the numbers, but at the right numbers, anything is feasible." 
 LCOR Inc., a Pennsylvania-based developer involved in the privatization of another big Port Authority project, the new International Arrivals Building at Kennedy International Airport, said it would also take a serious look at the Trade Center.
The authority expects to request bids formally in the next 2 months for a 99-year lease on the 11-million-square-foot complex, which includes the skyline-defining twin towers and four other office buildings. The authority hopes to have a lease signed by next fall.
Authority commissioners have said they hope to get $1.5 billion for the complex, with $300 million up front, but officials shied away from any discussion of hard numbers yesterday. Charles A. Gargano, the vice chairman of the authority, would say only that he hoped to get "as much as possible."
Heading off a confrontation -- at least for the time being -- with the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Gargano, who is also chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said that whoever leased the Trade Center would have to pay full property taxes. The Giuliani administration says the complex should pay about $105 million in taxes, $80 million more than is now paid by the Port Authority, which is tax-exempt but pays a fee.
Gov. George E. Pataki had said Wednesday only that the lessee would have to pay "fair taxes." The Port Authority would presumably fetch a higher price for the property if it could get the city to agree to a tax break for the lessee.
But Mayor Giuliani insisted yesterday that, in private hands, the complex would be taxed like any other building. Real estate analysts said that at full taxation, the Trade Center was probably worth closer to $1.2 billion than $1.5 billion.
With Mr. Gargano's assurance on the tax question in hand, Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine called the authority's decision to lease the Trade Center "a great victory for the city and for the Mayor."
Authority officials were vague about their plans for any money the lease would bring in above the more than $100 million a year in net rental income the Trade Center generates now.
The authority's chairman, Lewis M. Eisenberg, said that if there was extra income, some of it could be used to pay off bonds. He added, "Whatever proceeds come will likely be spent on transportation infrastructure and the economic development of the region."
The authority has been under increasing pressure from the governors who control it, Mr. Pataki and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, to sell off its vast real estate holdings and concentrate on transportation projects like dredging New York Harbor and building a rail link to Kennedy Airport from Manhattan.
The biggest question now, however, is who will bid on the Trade Center.
Mr. Trump, who is already in the midst of building and seeking financing for the $3 billion Riverside South project on the Upper West Side, said his interest in the Trade Center would depend in part on "what the economy is like at the time they put it up." He declined to go into detail on how he might finance the project, but John Lyons, the executive managing director of Granite Partners, a national real estate investment banking firm, said that any developer who wanted to take on the Trade Center would have to hook up with "a deep-pocketed entity that is looking at this primarily as an investment."
Several real estate executives had said that Tishman Speyer Properties, which runs Rockefeller Center, might be a likely candidate to bid on the Trade Center, but the company said yesterday that it would not be interested.
For LCOR, the Trade Center is not an unfamiliar property: the company, based in Berwyn, Pa., bid on an earlier attempt to privatize the Trade Center's retail space, which was eventually folded into the current plan.
Company executives will give the proposal "a very close look," said Frank Marino, a spokesman for the company. In addition to holding a 40 percent interest in the Kennedy Airport terminal project, LCOR drew up the master plan for the upcoming relocation of Pennsylvania Station and developed the Federal office building at 290 Broadway.
Barry Gosin, the chief executive of Newmark & Company Real Estate, said that a big real estate investment trust might also be able to handle the project. But most REIT's have taken a beating in the stock market recently, which would make it harder for them to raise the money needed to acquire the Trade Center.

HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE PRESS;
Presenting News in a Time of Scandal Becomes a Delicate Balancing Act

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
It has been an unequal contest. Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico versus the possibility of impeachment proceedings. International economic breakdowns versus an unprecedented video of President Clinton defending himself during questioning about intimate sex acts with Monica S. Lewinsky.
Sometimes it has seemed that the only newsmakers able to hold their own against the steamroller of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal have been two baseball players, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. 
 What news coverage gets short shrift when a scandal like the present one takes grip of the news columns and airwaves? None, some newspaper editors and network news executives say. Lots, say others, citing the pre-election coverage of the primaries held around the country on Sept. 15, the instability in Russia, the economic troubles of Japan and Brazil and the issue of international terrorism.
"News coverage has been distorted to the most incredible degree I have seen in my lifetime," said Charles Peters, editor of The Washington Monthly, a political journal in the capital.
In interviews over the last two days, editors and news directors have defended their judgment calls, but most acknowledge concern about the sacrifices made to accommodate the heavy Clinton coverage that they believe is justified because the events could lead to impeachment hearings.
"You're talking about changing presidents," said Al Ortiz, the executive producer of the "Evening News with Dan Rather" on CBS. "It's hard to imagine anything more important as that. My intention has been to devote as much time to this story as possible, to explain what's going on behind the scenes."
Mr. Ortiz added, "Several important foreign stories -- Kosovo and Russia -- have had to take a little bit of a back seat."
Ben Bradlee Jr., a deputy managing editor of The Boston Globe, said: "The possibility of impeachment comes along once a generation. But you still have to be concerned about getting a good mix in the paper."
The release of the Clinton videotape demanded so much space that The Boston Globe delayed for a day the third part of a series on food safety. At The Chicago Tribune and The Baltimore Sun, investigative projects ready for publication were also temporarily shelved last weekend.
"What gets delayed might be a series on race or an investigative project in the works that's timely and topical but not urgent," said William K. Marimow, The Sun's managing editor.
The issue goes beyond where articles are placed. Diversion of resources comes at a price. One test of how excessive coverage is, said James P. Willse, editor of The Newark Star-Ledger, is "what do the papers look like three and four and five days away."
"If in covering the story you've exhausted yourself, and five days out there is nothing in the paper, that's a subtler statement of the kind of price you've paid," Mr. Willse said.
At The Sun, Mr. Marimow said, state political and government reporters were not called in to the crisis coverage. Instead, he said, "we took people we consider really talented working on ongoing projects that didn't have the same degree of urgency." For instance, a reporter working on a financial investigation, who has special legal expertise, was pulled off the day the Clinton videotape appeared to assess the President's effectiveness as a witness.
At The Washington Post, the managing editor, Steve Coll, said pre-primary coverage was not cut back.
"We certainly haven't produced any less journalism about the election this season than we would have otherwise," Mr. Coll said.
Even on days of peak coverage, the Clinton scandal has not driven all other news off front pages. The Dallas Morning News devoted three of seven front-page articles to the Washington crisis on Tuesday, the day after the videotape was broadcast. The front page also included an article about the Dallas Cowboy's Monday night victory over the Giants, a report on the death of the sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner and an in-depth article about Lithuania, part of a series on the Baltic states.
Reader complaints about excessive coverage of the Washington crisis have been heard, some editors say. But readers in unusually high numbers also bought the newspapers containing text from the Starr report. At The Tribune, that edition sold 75,000 copies more than usual; at The St. Petersburg Times, the excess demand for that edition reached 5,500 or more copies.
Rich Oppel, the editor of The Austin American-Statesman, said his paper containing text of the Starr report sold 9,300 extra copies. Nonetheless, he is troubled by the sacrifices in coverage.
"We delayed some Texas state election roundups," Mr. Oppel said, adding, "What got crowded off our page one has been the German election, the shaky economy, the Russian ruble, and reports of erratic economic developments in Tokyo and Hong Kong."
But Andrew Barnes, the editor of The St. Petersburg Times, argues that newspaper editorial judgments are "not a zero-sum game."
"We're in the position -- if there's more going on, we make more room for it," Mr. Barnes said, adding, "If the premise is that this scandal is a distraction, so is life."
Paul Friedman, the executive producer of ABC's "World News Tonight," strongly defends his network's mix of recent coverage, pointing to four reports on Russia since Sept. 7, an in-depth report on the world economy on Sept. 16 and a Sept. 9 broadcast from North Korea.
Still, in another office at ABC, the newscaster Ted Koppel said he and his colleagues at "Nightline" were assembling commentators to discuss, on the air periodically, "what it is they think is of gravest importance in the world that we're not paying proper attention to."
"We've made an institutional decision as a program," Mr. Koppel said, "that we need to do a night that says, 'While our attention was otherwise directed, these other stories were happening.' "

HEADLINE: Nigeria's New President Visits U.S. and Wins Support for Regime

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who became President of Nigeria in June by an accident of fate, came to the United States this week determined to persuade skeptics that his Government will be short-lived, open and incorruptible, and that the country had finally turned the corner to democracy after years of military rule.
"Come next May, we will hand over to the elected Government," said General Abubakar, a low-key reformer who succeeded one of Africa's most destructive dictators, Gen. Sani Abacha, who died of a heart attack on June 8. The date with democracy, General Abubakar said today, is "sacrosanct." 
 General Abubakar, meeting with reporters at a breakfast in a glittering dining room at the Palace Hotel on Madison Avenue -- a reminder of the immense wealth that official Nigeria has at its disposal -- laid out the political steps ahead.
In December local elections will take place, followed by voting for state governors and legislators in January. In February an election for president and a national assembly will be held, with the formal handover of power three months later.
"Back home the political parties are busy forming," he said.
General Abubakar, 56, said that after his interim presidency ends, he plans to retire from any military and political roles.
The general, a measured speaker who seldom smiles, has won the confidence of American and European officials during his three months in power. Today the European Union's Development Commissioner, Joao de Deus Pinheiro, called for an easing of sanctions on Nigeria as a reward for General Abubakar's promise to restore democracy. Sanctions were imposed in 1995 after the Abacha Government executed Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other advocates of the Ogoni people.
The United Nations is sending a team of political specialists to Nigeria this week to advise the Government on organizing elections. Secretary General Kofi Annan visited the country in the summer and aides say he was convinced that the new Government was making an earnest effort to listen to the Nigerian people.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who attended a Security Council meeting here today on Africa, praised General Abubakar for "taking steps to bring Nigeria back into the world community."
General Abubakar, who addressed the General Assembly today, met President Clinton in Washington on Wednesday. The Nigerian President, who described Mr. Clinton as one of the few world leaders really interested in his country, said he was told that if he stayed on his democratic course, the United States was prepared to help win some debt relief from international lending institutions and might also allow the resumption of direct flights to and from Nigeria.
Turning to the issue of corruption, for which Nigeria under a series of military rulers has made itself notorious worldwide, General Abubakar said that "Government transactions will now be transparent and open and whatever contracts are going to be given will be done by open bidding."
"On the issue of freedom of speech and association," he said, "we have done all we can to make these things as easy as it is all over the world. There is freedom of association, there is freedom of press. In Nigeria, licenses are being given now to private organizations to set up radio and television stations. We have well over 200, 300 newspapers and magazines circulating without any hindrance."

Markets Decline as Fears Of Additional Losses Grow
The $3.5 billion rescue of a large investment fund verging on collapse unnerved many markets around the world, raised a clamor for a Government investigation and created fear that other losses might surface.
Rather than contain the problem and bring stability, the cash infusion late Wednesday by a consortium of banks and brokerage firms to salvage Long-Term Capital Management only seemed to rattle investors. Page A1.
 
The Swiss bank UBS said it expected to report a third-quarter loss as high as one billion Swiss francs -- $721 million -- related to losses in emerging markets, equities and the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management. Its charge for an equity stake in and derivatives transactions with Long-Term Capital Management was estimated at $685 million. C4.

Income Higher for Most Americans
The Census Bureau said the proportion of Americans living in poverty declined last year, mostly because of reductions in poverty among black and Hispanic families.

HEADLINE: In the Village, Halloween Parade Is Under Fire as Too Unruly

BYLINE: By KEVIN FLYNN 

 BODY:
Like the neighborhood in which it is set, the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade, a milelong train of 20,000 marchers outfitted in elaborate, often naughty costumes, has long celebrated creativity, eccentricity and the liberating power of bending the rules.
Now, as parade organizers prepare for the 25th-anniversary march, some neighborhood leaders are concerned that the event, which draws a boisterous crowd of more than a million to the Village each year, has traveled too far down the road from irreverent to unruly. 
 "There is a great deal of sentiment that the excesses of the parade have gone too far," said Alan Jay Gerson, chairman of Community Board 2 in the Village. "If it does not work out this year, this could be the last parade."
Mr. Gerson's board will hold a hearing next month on the future of the parade, at which time he hopes to hear ideas on how to alleviate the traffic snarls and rowdiness that have damaged the event's standing within the neighborhood.
But City Councilman Thomas K. Duane, who represents the Village, has gone even further, formally asking the Giuliani administration to cancel the parade now or move it to another neighborhood.
Mr. Duane is supported by some community board members and neighborhood leaders who contend that the event, which started as a local procession by a few dozen friends, has grown into an overcrowded nuisance, a magnet for drunken hooligans and a flash point for bias crimes against homosexuals.
"My own personal experience is that it is a sea of homophobia out there," said Mr. Duane, who is gay.
The parade organizers and their supporters, including the Greenwich Village Chamber of Commerce, say Mr. Duane is overreacting and threatening to kill a carnival, the "Mardi Gras of New York," that has become an economic engine for the Village and a vital thread in the cultural fabric of the city.
"I don't think the parade should just end because there are some potential problems with it," said Ralph Lee, 63, a mask designer who founded, but no longer runs, the event. "It seems like rather than chuck the whole thing, something should be done to work these problems out."
Jeanne Fleming, a theater director who runs the parade from her Dutchess County home, said: "This is a joyful night for the whole city. Very little goes wrong."
The parade debate comes at a time when many people in Greenwich Village are alarmed by a rash of crimes, including three recent murders and several reported assaults against homosexuals. The assaults were part of an 81 percent rise in reported anti-gay bias crimes citywide this year.
Last week, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that in response to the crimes, he had added officers to the Sixth Precinct, which patrols the neighborhood.
In a Sept. 21 letter to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Duane, a Democrat who is running for the State Senate, said the city should withhold the parade permit until it held a public hearing on the parade.
"In light of the recent terrible and violent crime wave which our neighborhood has been experiencing, I believe that it is critical that we pay particular attention to this issue, and consider whether or not it is appropriate to continue to hold this event in Greenwich Village," he wrote Mr. Giuliani. The Mayor's office did not respond to calls for a comment.
Supporters of the event point out that, according to police statistics, no anti-gay bias crimes have been reported during either of the last two parades.
"I feel that the problems are slightly exaggerated and that the event goes very smoothly," said Officer Stephen O'Halloran, who handles community relations for the Sixth Precinct. He acknowledged that 400 summonses were issued for public drinking last year.
Parade critics said they were particularly concerned this year because Halloween falls on a Saturday and larger crowds are anticipated.
Few dispute that the parade, which steps off on Sixth Avenue at Spring Street and continues north to 23d Street, is a changed event from the homespun procession of years ago. It is now an established New York spectacle that is broadcast on television and partly financed through city and corporate grants.
Community leaders estimate that as many as two million people may line the police barricades this year to be entertained by the routinely unusual assortment of giant animated puppets, kazoo bands, stilt walkers and exotically costumed marchers, some of them acting in zany harmony, like the 40 public school teachers who showed up one year disguised as Imelda Marcos's shoes.
Though the parade is now shunned by some gay residents of Village, organizers said hundreds of gay men and lesbians continue to march each year.
"One of the reasons people come to the parade is to see the drag queens," said Ms. Fleming, the organizer. "This is a crowd that wants to have fun. They are yelling: 'O. K.! Way to go!' People are coming for the wacky and the creative. They are not there to hurt somebody. They are there to have fun."
Bobby Miller, a 46-year-old writer who is gay and has lived in the Village for 23 years, said the problem of violence against homosexuals pervades the culture and was not spawned simply by a parade.
"I don't feel threatened there anymore than I would be threatened at an Irish parade or a Puerto Rican parade or any other parade where there are large groups of people," said Mr. Miller, who has never missed the Village event.
But Arthur Strickler, who is also gay and the district manager for Community Board 2, said: "Many of these people who come out now are not there to laugh with us. They are there to laugh at us."

HEADLINE: A Hedge Fund Crashes

 BODY:
The concept of "too big to fail" has now been extended to a huge hedge fund that was run by people thought to be financial wizards. The bailout of the fund by a consortium of the country's leading financial institutions is a reminder of how fragile the world's financial markets now are, and of the risks of making big bets that markets will act in predictable ways.
The hedge fund was run by John Meriwether, the former Salomon Brothers official widely viewed as a Wall Street genius. His forte was in trading bonds, buying those that were relatively cheap and selling those that were relatively expensive. The idea was to make a little money on each trade, and make a lot of money overall by using borrowed money to buy bonds in large quantities. For every dollar put up by investors in the fund, Mr. Meriwether seems to have borrowed more than $20. 
 In determining what investments to make, Mr. Meriwether and his colleagues, including two Nobel Prize-winning economists, had sophisticated computers that reviewed historical prices of bonds and other financial instruments and found relationships between them. Strategies were then calculated on the assumption that events that had never happened before could not happen at all. But they did. Bond prices almost always rise and fall together. But in the current financial crisis, the prices of United States Treasury bonds have soared as investors bought them in search of safety while the prices of most other bonds -- backed by corporations or by other governments -- have fallen, as investors grew nervous about the risks involved.
Unfortunately, Mr. Meriwether, who at the peak was managing more than $100 billion -- the vast majority of it borrowed money -- had bet against such an occurrence. After all, that is what happens almost all the time.
The odds were with Mr. Meriwether, whose fund returned profits of more than 40 percent a year in 1995 and 1996, and of 17 percent in 1997, even after hefty management fees. But betting the way he did turns out to be a little like Russian roulette: the odds of winning are very good, but you can't play again if you lose.
Effectively, Mr. Meriwether's fund has been taken over by the banks and brokerage houses that lent money to it. Investors in the fund -- who had to put up a minimum of $10 million each -- are likely to lose virtually all the money they invested. There is no public money in the $3.5 billion bailout, but it was organized by the Federal Reserve, which stepped in because of fears that shaky financial markets would suffer even more if Mr. Meriwether's fund was forced to liquidate its holdings.
At best, markets will return to normal and the banks that kept Mr. Meriwether's fund afloat will make some money, perhaps even enough to share with the original investors. At worst, markets will continue to sink and the bailout money will vanish.
The great bull market of the 1980's and 1990's has been built in significant ways on leverage, as big players found ways to borrow to the hilt. Now the banks that made the loans are getting nervous and demanding more collateral before lending to other hedge funds. That contraction in credit is prudent, but it will put more pressure on financial markets that are already feeling the strain.

A Case Study In Instability Hurts Stocks

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stock prices tumbled yesterday on intensified fears about world financial instability, which has so badly infected a large American investment fund that the Federal Reserve helped organize a $3.5 billion emergency rescue.
Bank and brokerage shares were pummeled as the Dow Jones industrial average relinquished about two-thirds of Wednesday's big advance to decline 152.42 points, or 1.87 percent, at 8,001.99. Stocks also fell 6 percent in Brazil and by lesser amounts in Europe but advanced in Tokyo following a Japanese holiday. 
 Early today, at midday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 456.28 points, or 3.21 percent, to 13,749.50.
"It's clear the dimensions of these problems remain bigger than anticipated and will take a longer period to adequately deal with," said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, referring to Japanese banks and other sources of persistent concern.
Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn., is teetering on failure from bad speculative bets that could have resulted in a cascade of losses if not for the rescue. Mr. Galvin said that "the magnitude of the numbers shook the confidence of the market."
Analysts also expressed some second thoughts about Wednesday's enthusiasm for the possibility that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week. Some wondered whether it would accomplish much, while others reinterpreted the comments of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that prompted this optimism in light of what he undoubtedly knew was the dire condition of the hedge fund.
"We were reminded in the most eye-opening manner of what happens in a financial crisis," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of the First Albany Corporation. "This is one of the ways financial crises can get transmitted around the globe."
Much of the fund's problem resulted from a rush by world investors into the safety of United States Treasury securities, which it had bet would decline, after Russia defaulted on debt.
Even though stocks had slumped in Europe -- 2.36 percent in Frankfurt, 1.25 percent in Paris and nine-tenths of 1 percent in London -- shares opened somewhat higher on Wall Street. But they quickly retreated as the implications of the near-failure of Long-Term Capital sank in. The Dow average was nearly 220 points lower before some late-session buying pared the loss and edged it back above the 8,000 mark.
J. P. Morgan, down 5 3/16 , to 87 5/8, and American Express, down 4 3/16 , to 79 1/4, had the biggest negative effect on the average, accounting for one-quarter of its decline.
Other decliners included Citicorp, down 6 3/4, to 98 3/4; Merrill Lynch, down 4 5/8, to 53 3/8; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, down 5 11/16 , to 51 9/16 ; Lehman Brothers, down 4 3/16 , to 33 11/16 ; Chase Manhattan, down 3 3/4, to 46 3/8, and Charles Schwab down 3 1/16 , to 40 1/16 .
BankAmerica dropped 5 1/4, to 60, while Nationsbank, its merger partner, was down 4 3/8, to 54 3/8. Nationsbank stockholders today approved the deal, scheduled for completion next Wednesday. Travelers Group, which is to merge with Citicorp, skidded 3 5/16 , to 39 5/8.
Only five of the 30 Dow stocks ended with gains, all fractional except for International Paper's, up 1 9/16 , to 46 7/8.
Broader gauges fared worse, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down 23.37 points, or 2.19 percent, to 1,042.72, and the Nasdaq down 39.93 points, or 2.27 percent, to 1,720.34.
Among high-technology fliers, Yahoo shed 2 5/8, to 115 1/4, and Amazon.com fell 3, to 102 1/8, following spectacular gains Wednesday, while Microsoft lost 3 1/2, to 110 1/8.
But nothing could keep investors away from Ebay Inc., bidding shares of the fledgling Internet company as high as 54 1/4 from an initial offering price of 18. The shares finished at 47 3/8, with more than 9 million shares changing hands.
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered advancing ones by 2,042 to 1,093, with 43 making new highs and 127 new lows. Volume was 805.9 million, down from 900.2 million on Wednesday.

Bond Prices Rally Again

(By Bloomberg News)
Treasury bond prices rose for a second day yesterday amid optimism the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates next week.
"What we're seeing in the market is an almost textbook reaction," with shorter-term securities, the most sensitive to Fed cuts, gaining the most, said Alan Koepplin, who helps manage $2 billion in fixed-income securities at SG Cowen Asset Management.
He expects the Fed to approve a quarter-point reduction, to 5.25 percent, in its rate for overnight lending between banks. The central bank has left its target for overnight lending between banks at 5.5 percent since March 1997.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 2/32 , to 105 6/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, remained at 5.16 percent.
The Ford Motor Company took advantage of a pronounced pause in market volatility yesterday to price a $1.5 billion global bond offering, adeal that was increased in size by 50 percent because of investor interest.
"The deal grew on itself," said Robin Luce, managing director in debt syndicate and debt capital markets at Merrill Lynch & Company, co-lead manager of the offering with Lehman Brothers Inc. "Ford wanted a well-received offering, a well-executed offering."

HEADLINE: FALLEN STAR: THE FALLOUT;
Swiss Bank Foresees a Loss Of $721 Million This Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ZURICH, Sept. 24

 BODY:
UBS A.G., Europe's biggest bank, announced today that it expected to report a third-quarter loss as high as one billion Swiss francs -- currently $721.6 million -- related to losses in emerging markets, equities and the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the American hedge fund.
UBS, based here, said it was taking a charge equivalent to $685 million against an equity stake in, and derivatives transactions with, Long-Term Capital. Big institutional lenders, spurred by the Federal Reserve, agreed to extend $3.5 billion to the fund after huge 1998 losses. UBS had the biggest exposure of the 16 banks and brokerage firms in the rescue group. 
 "It's a tremendous blow to confidence," said Richard Kruse, an analyst with Oppenheim-Finanzanalyse in Frankfurt. "It really gives a bad impression of management."
UBS is the first institution to disclose damage stemming from Long-Term Capital's near-collapse. While the announcement could increase pressure on the other banks to disclose their potential exposure, the others are not expected to sustain similar losses because they are believed to have cash or Treasury bonds as collateral for loans or other obligations.
UBS's profit warning is the latest among dozens from European and American banks that have been stung by plunging stock markets stemming from economic turmoil in Russia, Asia and other markets.
While UBS had warned of losses in August stemming from Russia, the charge against its investment in Long-Term Capital came as a surprise, forcing the bank to call a news conference on short notice here after Swiss stock markets closed.
Shares of UBS plunged nearly 11 percent before the announcement, but after the company scheduled the news conference. The stock closed at 365 Swiss francs, down 44 francs. UBS shares have fallen 42 percent in the last two months,
The chief executive of UBS, Marcel Ospel, said the bank bought an equity stake of 10 to 15 percent of Long-Term Capital in 1997.
UBS and the other banks in in the consortium are not optimistic that they will get much of their rescue funds back. "The rescue plan does not leave much scope for recovery," Mr. Ospel said, adding that UBS never assisted Long-Term in its market investments and that the bank has no further investments in hedge funds of this type.
The bank's earnings potential, he added, "is not impaired in its foundation, provided the international economic situation does not decrease further."
The bank, which was created through the merger of the Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation, said it expected to report only a modest profit in the second half as a result of the third-quarter loss.
In equities trading, one-third of UBS's losses came from proprietary trading losses, with the remainder from what Mr. Ospel called "volatility" in worldwide stock markets.

HEADLINE: 2d-Quarter Growth Stronger Than Estimated,U.S. Says

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Solid consumer spending ignited stronger growth in the second quarter than previously estimated, the Government said today, while separate reports pointed to underlying strength in the nation's economy.
Analysts said that despite pockets of weakness, the American economy was weathering the turmoil in Asia, Russia and elsewhere quite well, with few signs that the expansion that began in the spring of 1991 was running out of steam. 
 The Commerce Department said gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the economy, grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the quarter, up from the 1.6 percent estimated a month ago, but still well below the growth rate of 5.5 percent in the first quarter. It was the weakest quarterly growth rate in three years.
In a separate report pointing to resilience in manufacturing, the department said orders for big-ticket manufactured goods jumped 1.6 percent in August, the third consecutive increase.
In another report, the Labor Department said new unemployment claims fell last week to the lowest level since April, a sign of continuing strength in the job market that could buoy consumer spending despite the unsteady stock market.
"The U.S. economy continues to have a tremendous amount of resilience," said Lynn Reaser, an economist at the Nationsbank Corporation.
"Going forward, the numbers are going to be somewhat better than the second quarter, which was hurt by the General Motors strike," she said, predicting a growth rate of 2.5 percent in the second half.
Part of the jump in orders for durable goods last month came as G.M. plants started production again after being idled in June and July. Aircraft orders were also strong. Excluding transportation, durable goods orders actually fell 2.1 percent last month, reflecting weak demand for electrical equipment and other products in Asia.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, speaking to reporters in Washington, said the farming and manufacturing sectors were vulnerable to global turmoil, though on balance odds remained strong for solid growth with low inflation.
"The risk to our economy is real and as the crisis has affected more countries, that risk has become greater," Mr. Rubin said.
In its report, the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment pay fell 8,000, to 292,000 last week, a fresh sign of a strong job market that is bolstering consumer spending, which fuels two-thirds of the economy.
"Consumers have been just irrepressible," said Cynthia Latta, an economist for DRI/McGraw Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass. "And no wonder since the job outlook is good, interest rates are low and pay increases have been substantial."

HEADLINE: FALLEN STAR: THE OVERVIEW;
Hedge Fund Bailout Rattles Investors and Markets

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
The $3.5 billion rescue of a big, risky investment fund verging on collapse unnerved markets around the world yesterday, raised a clamor for a Government investigation and created fear that other enormous hidden losses might become evident in the weeks and months ahead.
Rather than contain the problem and bring stability to Wall Street, the cash infusion late Wednesday by a consortium of banks and brokerage firms to salvage Long-Term Capital Management L.P. only seemed to rattle investors. Banks began to tighten lending requirements to other investment funds, raising fears of a credit shortage. 
 United States stocks fell broadly, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing more than half its 257.21-point gain on Wednesday. Shares of financial stocks were particularly hard-hit. Page C1.
Long-Term Capital, with a portfolio worth $90 billion, is one of the best-known hedge funds, financial investments that cater to the rich and make big and often risky investment bets with the hope of spectacular returns. The recent turmoil in financial markets, particularly the collapse in Russia, led to staggering losses for Long-Term Capital.
Investors tried to absorb not only what had happened to Long-Term Capital and its founder, the Wall Street bond trader John W. Meriwether, but what the deal to salvage the fund meant for markets now.
As details of Long-Term Capital's fall began to trickle out and the shock among traders, brokers and bankers began to fade, worry set in. Members of Congress called for an inquiry into what went wrong and resentment grew that an elite firm, populated by industry stars and two Nobel laureates, was saved from a disaster of its own making with an unusual dose of help from the Federal Reserve, which orchestrated the rescue effort.
By midday, it was clear that Long-Term Capital's problems were not going to be confined to the firm and a few high-roller investors. The ripple effect started with UBS A.G. of Switzerland, Europe's largest bank, which said it had lost as much as $721.6 million in the third quarter, partly because of its risky investments with Long-Term Capital. Its stock fell 10.8 percent.
Of deep concern to the financial world is what impact the fund's debacle will have on worldwide bond markets, which have already been badly shaken by events in emerging markets in the last two months. Fear of a pullback in lending by major financial institutions also grew yesterday as banks were awakened to the risks in their previous easy-money attitudes toward borrowers. If difficulty in borrowing money lasted more than a few weeks, it could cause a significant slowdown in the United States economy.
The implications of Mr. Meriwether's troubles are great for hedge funds, which operate relatively freely in world markets with little oversight from regulators. Many believe that Long-Term's near-collapse and effective takeover by big banks and brokers will translate into increased client nervousness and rising redemptions of shares at other firms. For funds operating in the already-damaged bond market, redemptions would cause a continued drop in the value of those portfolios. And if some of these areas sustain further damage, like high-yield bonds, heavy redemptions could damage plain-vanilla mutual funds.
Finally, there is worry on Wall Street that the debacle will bring increased scrutiny by regulators to hedge funds. Representative John J. LaFalce, Democrat of New York, the ranking minority member of the House Banking Committee, said yesterday that "the virtual collapse and bailout of Long-Term Capital Management makes clear that the banking committee must continue its inquiry into potential risks posed by any gaps in the regulation of hedge funds." He said he would call on Representative Jim Leach, the chairman, "to do precisely that."
The specter of Long-Term's near-failure is not going away any time soon. Indeed, it will dog the financial industry through at least the end of the year. Traders said the possibility that its $90 billion portfolio might be sold would keep much of the fixed-income markets frozen. If the Fed cuts interest rates next Tuesday, as many expect, that would hurt many of Long-Term Capital's trades, which were bets on higher rates.
An immediate reaction to Long-Term's woes was that major banks and brokerage firms began demanding increased margins, or partial payments from their hedge fund customers on new trades.
Yesterday, the details of the bailout were being firmed up. Late in the day, investors in the fund were waiting to hear where they stood. It is expected that existing investors will end up with 10 percent of their original stakes in the firm and that the consortium of banks and brokers will hold a combined 90 percent.
An oversight committee with representatives from the banks will direct overall strategy at Long-Term Capital. In one of the many paradoxes attending the crisis, Mr. Meriwether will be reporting to people who were, in some cases, very junior traders on his desk at Salomon Brothers in the 1980's.
In addition to the shock on Wall Street that Mr. Meriwether's best-and-brightest firm had almost closed, there was also anger that the Government intervened to avert the firm's collapse. Government regulators have in the past organized efforts to prevent panic-selling that could hurt the markets, but it was unusual to see the Federal Reserve help arrange a rescue of a private investment fund for the very rich.
"The public-policy implications of such a bailout are considerable and very negative," said Stephen Modzelewski, a hedge fund manager at the Watermark Group in Princeton, N.J., and a former Salomon trader. "To rescue a large, overly risky hedge fund can only encourage other hedge funds to increase their risk profiles to imprudent levels and to discourage global financial institutions from requiring prudent margins from their large hedge fund customers."
A former Federal Reserve chairman, Paul A. Volcker, also expressed doubt about the idea of the United States central bank moving to help save Long-Term Capital, a risk-taking securities-trading operation. Bloomberg News reported that in a speech in Boston, Mr. Volcker asked, "Why should the weight of the Federal Government be brought to bear to help out a private investor?"
A week before the Long-Term bailout was negotiated at the headquarters of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, testified to Congress that bankers knew exactly what they were doing in the policing of hedge funds, and their attendant risks. On Sept. 16, he assured Representative Richard Baker, Republican of Louisiana, that risk in hedge fund lending was well under control.
The most significant question is what impact the rescue of Long-Term Capital will have on world markets and the domestic economy.
While the deal between Long-Term Capital and its creditors put an end to rumors of impending crisis that had plagued the firm in recent weeks, it did nothing to inject badly needed money into the non-Treasury fixed-income markets. If anything, the fact that the portfolio of money-losing trades still exists added to a view that the market is paralyzed and will remain so for some time.
Even though Long-Term says the $3.5 billion infusion will allow it to keep its trades in place until they work, the widespread belief on Wall Street is that these things are for sale. For investors who want to sell their high-yield bonds, emerging-market debt, convertible securities, even some mortgage-backed issues, there is still no place to go.
Some of the higher-quality markets will likely recover, however, from current, beaten-down levels. This includes AA-rated corporate bonds, some United States agency issues and zero-coupon Treasuries. Riskier issues will stay in the doghouse.
But a great concern that has emerged from the Long-Term Capital debacle is that it may result in a protracted reduction in credit available to businesses. Even though they have been warned by regulators for months, banks tend to require a disaster of this magnitude to awaken to the risks involved in lax lending. Borrowing will be harder to obtain, and to the degree that the economy's growth has been fueled by credit, that growth may now be stunted.
Charles Peabody, an analyst with Mitchell Securities, said he feared a recession in such a credit squeeze. "Regulators are going to go into the examination process at banks and begin identifying specific risk areas and require more capital against them," he said.
Amid the gloom on Wall Street yesterday, there was gallows humor. One trader said he soon expected to see someone wearing a sandwich board that read, "Will Manage Market-Neutral Hedge Fund for Food."

HOW SUCH AN INVESTMENT WORKS
1. The fund's managers find wealthy investors to invest in the fund. For example, each of Long-Term Capital's investors had to contribute at least $10 million.
2. The fund lines up credit from banks and brokerage firms to keep operations running smoothly. Some funds use these credit lines to increase the size of their investments, a process known as leveraging. At its high point earlier this year, Long-Term Capital was reportedly able to leverage the roughly $5 billion it had in capital into about $120 billion in investments.
3. Hedge funds are like other investment pools in that they can invest in virtually any type of security as well as complex derivatives in markets around the world. What distinguishes them is that they can take bigger risks and are subject to virtually no regulatory oversight.
 
HEDGING AN INVESTMENT
 
Despite their names, hedge funds do not necessarily hedge their investment decisions or protect themselves against market declines. They may speculate that some prices will rise at the same time that others fall.
 
A hedge fund buys a bond hoping that its price will go up. Betting that a bond's price will rise is going long in that bond.
 
At the same time, the fund borrows another bond and sells it, agreeing to return the borrowed bond sometime in the future. In this deal, the fund is hoping that the price of the borrowed bond will fall so that it will be less expensive to replace it. This is taking a short position in the borrowed bond.
 
Usually, the prices of many types of bonds move up and down in tandem. So if the price of the bond that was bought goes up, making money for the fund, the price of the bond that was borrowed is also likely to go up, meaning the fund will lose money in replacing the borrowed fund.
 
The hedge fund earns a profit if the profit on the bond that it bought is greater than the loss incurred on the bond sold short. Or if prices fall, the fund profits if the gain on the borrowed bond is greater than the loss on the bond that was bought. In either case, the process of going long and short at the same time is intended to minimize the risk to the fund, but it can also increase risk, as happened in the case of Long-Term Capital.
 
WHAT WENT WRONG
 
Long-Term Capital used sophisticated computer models to track and predict prices in the bond market. It got into trouble when those models failed.
 
Bond prices, particularly prices of bonds that are related, generally move in the same direction, but not always at the same rate. For example, one bond's price may temporarily rise faster than another's. Usually these price discrepancies eventually correct themselves. And usually the discrepancy in the relative price movements of two related bonds does not vary outside a certain range.
 
Long-Term Capital specialized in finding these price discrepancies and predicting which way prices would move. The fund got into trouble when it detected price discrepancies between U.S. Treasury securities and other bonds, including high-yield corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and European government bonds. Long-Term Capital decided to short U.S. Treasuries, a bet that their prices would go down, and go long on the other types of bonds, betting that their prices would go up.
 
The plunges in some many stock markets, though, caused investors to pour money into the U.S. Treasury market, a haven when there is economic turmoil, driving up the prices of Treasury securities. The falling yields on U.S. Treasuries, which move in the opposite direction to their prices, led to a decline in the interest rates for mortgages, pushing down the prices of some mortgage-backed securities. The flight to U.S. Treasuries also took its toll on the European and high-yield bond markets, where prices declined. With all of their bets going in the wrong direction, Long-Term Capital was squeezed.

HEADLINE: Black and Hispanic Poverty Falls, Reducing Overall Rate for Nation

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
The proportion of Americans living in poverty declined last year, mostly because of reductions in poverty among black and Hispanic families, the Census Bureau reported today.
The data reflected three consecutive years of growth in income, which have restored household incomes and poverty to the levels recorded in 1989, just before the last recession. 
 The poverty rate was 13.3 percent last year, down from 13.7 percent in 1996 and 15.1 percent in 1993. The number of people in poverty, 35.6 million last year, has dropped by 3.7 million since 1993.
The poverty rate for non-Hispanic whites was unchanged at 8.6 percent last year. But the rate for blacks declined to 26.5 percent, the lowest since the Government began collecting data on poverty among African Americans in 1959. The rate among blacks was 28.4 percent in 1996 and 33.1 percent in 1993.
And the poverty rate for Hispanic Americans declined to 27.1 percent, from 29.4 percent in 1996 -- the largest one-year drop in Hispanic poverty since 1977.
The data were a tonic for President Clinton, battered by months of embarrassing disclosures about his affair with a White House intern.
Mr. Clinton said the statistics vindicated his economic policies and showed that low-income people were finally sharing the fruits of a vibrant economy.
"Our growing economy is giving more and more families a chance to work their way out of poverty," he said in the Rose Garden of the White House. "After six years, it can't be an accident anymore."
Presidents generally get credit for economic growth and are blamed if the economy declines. Mr. Clinton fought successfully for increases in the minimum wage, which took effect in 1996 and 1997, and in the earned-income tax credit available to low-income workers. White House officials said those changes had helped reduce poverty.
Economists said that much of the decline in poverty was attributable to the overall strength of the economy, resulting from prudent management of Federal spending and interest rates.
Blacks have been among the President's most steadfast supporters in recent months, and today's data show that blacks have fared well in the Clinton years.
Over all, the number of families in poverty declined last year by 384,000, to 7.3 million from 7.7 million in 1996. Black families accounted for more than half of the decrease.
The welfare rolls are declining much faster than the number of people in poverty. But Rebecca M. Blank, of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said, "It's way too early to look at these numbers and conclude very much about the successes of welfare reform."
Many Democrats have predicted that cuts in welfare programs, like time limits on cash assistance, will tend to increase poverty. On the other hand, many Republicans say poverty will decline as mothers move from welfare to work and fathers pay more child support. In any event, it will be hard to separate the specific effects of the 1996 welfare law from changes in the economy.
The Census Bureau found surprisingly robust growth in income even among families headed by women, a group whose poverty has long seemed intractable. The incomes of households headed by women rose last year by 8 percent for blacks, 10.3 percent for Hispanic Americans and 3 percent for whites. Among non-Hispanic whites, hardly any change was seen.
The poverty rate for children was under 20 percent last year for the first time since 1989, and Mr. Clinton said child poverty had declined more since 1993 than in any other four-year period since the late 1960's.
But the poverty rate for people 18 to 64 years old was higher last year than in 1987-89. And for households headed by people 35 to 54, income has not kept pace with inflation, so real income was lower last year than in 1989, the bureau said.
Politicians have repeatedly denounced growing inequality in income distribution. But Census Bureau officials said their data suggested that inequality had stabilized.
"This is the fourth consecutive year in which there was no year-to-year change in overall income inequality," said Daniel H. Weinberg, chief of the Census Bureau office that collects income data.
Still, Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said it was remarkable that "income inequality has not been reduced after two years in which we've enjoyed the healthiest economy in more than" 30 years.
Mr. Weinberg said the bureau's field interviewers probably missed many people with very high incomes, just as they missed homeless people. He said, anyone who reports income of more than $1 million a year is listed as having $1 million of income.
The data in the report are drawn from interviews with residents of 50,000 households chosen to be representative of the nation. A family of four was classified as poor if it had cash income of less than $16,400 in 1997. The threshold for a family of three was $12,802. Income, as officially defined, does not include capital gains, health insurance or Government benefits like food stamps, Medicaid and housing subsidies.
The Census Bureau data show that the income of black households, after adjusting for inflation, was higher in 1997 than at any other time in the last three decades.
The median income of black households rose 4.3 percent last year, to $25,050, and since 1993 it has increased by 15 percent, or $3,354, after adjusting for inflation. The number of households above the median is the same as the number below it.
For Hispanic households, the median income rose 4.5 percent last year, to $26,628, and has risen 4.8 percent since 1993. But Hispanic income appears to have stagnated and is about the same, after adjusting for inflation, as in 1972.
In its report, the Census Bureau also made these points:
* Median household income rose last year by 1.9 percent, to $37,005 from $36,306, after adjusting for inflation.
* State poverty rates, measured by three-year averages, ranged from an extraordinary low of 6.9 percent in New Hampshire to a high of 24 percent in New Mexico.
* The poverty rate for 1995 to 1997 averaged 8.8 percent in New Jersey, 10 percent in Connecticut and 16.6 percent in New York.
The report also said the number of blacks in poverty dropped last year to 9.1 million, from 9.7 million in 1996. The number of Hispanic people in poverty declined to 8.3 million, from 8.7 million. The number of poor non-Hispanic whites was about the same in 1997 as in 1996 -- 16.5 million.

HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: PUBLIC OPINION;
POLL FINDS CLINTON IN STRONG REBOUND SINCE VIDEO AIRING

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE with JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
President Clinton's standing with Americans has rebounded broadly in the days since the release of his videotaped testimony before a grand jury and, in fact, there are stirrings of a backlash against the Republican-controlled Congress and the House Judiciary Committee itself as it presses forward with an impeachment inquiry, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
By a clear majority, Americans said they disapproved of how the Judiciary Committee had handled the matter. While committee members said they released the video-tape for the public's benefit, 78 percent of Americans, and 65 percent of Republicans, said it should never have been released. 
 People said they objected to the committee's prying into what they regard as a private matter and that it was unnecessary to make public salacious details about sex. In addition, 65 percent of Americans said Republicans in Congress were unfairly trying to weaken the President and the Democrats; 39 percent of Republicans saw it that way as well.
But even in the face of a turnabout for Mr. Clinton, the first glimpse of how the Monica Lewinsky scandal could play out on Nov. 3 in the national elections helps explain why Republicans are sticking with a strategy of confrontation. The Republican approach is popular with the party's core voters, and those voters are most likely to turn out on Election Day. Appeals to a partisan core of Republicans may carry long-term risks, however, if they give the party an image as overly partisan and out to topple a President.
The apparent resurgence for Mr. Clinton has come swiftly -- and is surprisingly pronounced. Not only has the monthslong slide in his personal ratings halted but, in a marked shift from only a week ago, Americans also trust him more as a leader, like him more, are less inclined to think he committed perjury before the grand jury and increasingly believe that the scandal is a private matter that has little to do with his job as President.
Mr. Clinton is also helped by a growing sense among Americans that the investigation by Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, has spiraled out of control.
In a telling display of the public's exasperation with the entire matter, people are now divided over whether Mr. Clinton should be censured by Congress. Forty-six percent of all Americans favor censure, as do 55 percent of Republicans; only a week ago 57 percent of all Americans wanted such a punishment, as did 70 percent of Republicans.
Despite the more promising news for Mr. Clinton -- his job approval rating has risen in the past week to a solid 67 percent and even to a respectable 40 percent among conservative Republicans -- his gains should be viewed in relative terms. Most Americans, for example, continue to say that the President does not share their moral code.
But the most striking finding in the telephone poll, which was conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday with 960 adults nationwide, was that on question after question Mr. Clinton recaptured support. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Summing up the sentiment of many Americans who have grown impatient with the Judiciary Committee, Virginia Caperton, 68, a retired factory supervisor in Fennville, Mich., said, "I just feel the Judiciary Committee is too partisan."
Mrs. Caperton, a Democrat, explained in a follow-up interview: "I don't think they're going to give him enough time to go through all of the testimony. I don't think that the offense that he committed is worth all the time and the trouble and the expense of impeachment hearings."
Deborah Huisken, a poll respondent from Montague, Mass., said, "The members of Congress should look to themselves first and tidy up their own backyards."
Expressing weariness about the duration of the inquiry, Ms. Huisken, 42, a freelance writer who is an independent, said of Mr. Clinton, "It's appropriate for him to be censured, but it needs to be done as expeditiously as possible."
And Nancy Thirtyacre, 46, a Republican respondent from Wellsville, Ohio, who described herself as a housewife, put it this way: "This whole thing is a personal matter between him and his wife now, and we should let the guy do his job so we can get back on track."
Echoing the 53 percent of Americans who said they would be satisfied if no action was taken against the President and the matter was dropped, Ms. Thirtyacre added: "This whole thing has gone so far now that they're trying to dig up every little bit of dirt they can. But let's face it -- there's dirt on everybody."
She also was among the overwhelming proportion of 8 in 10 Americans who said the investigation has not been worth all it has taken from the public.
Seven in 10 Americans said they saw or heard some part of Mr. Clinton's appearance before the grand jury, although only 1 in 10 said they sat through the entire four hours. Yet the President's performance, and the subsequent drive by the White House to emphasize its side of the scandal and to frame the moves by Congress as needlessly partisan, gave Mr. Clinton the same sort of boost that has helped him out of difficult situations in the past.
Mr. Clinton's bounce back in the last few days was reminiscent of when his popularity shot up after his State of the Union Message in late January, which he delivered shortly after allegations about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, were disclosed.
The President's gains seemed to have come at the expense of Congress and Mr. Starr. The overall rating of Congress is 48 percent, according to the latest poll, roughly where it has been all year. But last week it was unusually high, at 56 percent. The current rating is still impressive for Congress.
In November 1994, just before the last midterm elections, only 20 percent of Americans approved of the way Congress was doing its job. A year later there was a backlash against Republicans in Congress when the public thought lawmakers had gone too far and shut down the Government for partisan purposes. At that time, approval of Congress was at 26 percent.
Six out of 10 people who watched Mr. Clinton's testimony said he mostly tried to avoid answering the questions. But, by the same margin, Americans who watched said it was appropriate for him to refuse to answer questions about his sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Among Republicans, 4 out of 10 said his refusal to answer those questions was understandable.
That support for Mr. Clinton may come because a majority of Americans think Mr. Starr has conducted a mostly partisan investigation to damage Mr. Clinton. Sixty-four percent of Americans say the investigation is partisan; last week, 55 percent held that view. And 49 percent now say they believe the President committed perjury before the grand jury, down from 56 percent in a CBS News poll last weekend.
Americans also made clear that they do not expect any President to be a model of rectitude. Only 21 percent said that having a moral role model is most important; 65 percent said they would rather have Presidents who could do their job effectively.
While Mr. Clinton's personal ratings have improved since last week -- he is viewed favorably by 45 percent of Americans and unfavorably by 38 percent -- those of Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is leading the Republican Congressional strategy, have slipped further. The Speaker's favorable rating is 18 percent and his unfavorable rating is 34 percent; last week, the ratings were 24 percent and 31 percent, respectively.
Republicans warn that Democrats should not be too heartened by the poll findings. "It's like they're in the eye of the hurricane," said Rich Galen, an adviser to Mr. Gingrich. "I wouldn't take the plywood down from the windows just yet."
The survey underscored the gap that has confounded many politicians between the general mood of the public and that of the conservative Republican constituency. Throughout the poll, the views of conservative Republicans were dramatically different from those of liberal and moderate Republicans.
For example, when offered the options of censuring Mr. Clinton, beginning impeachment hearings or dropping the matter, 61 percent of conservative Republicans preferred to begin hearings, compared to only 35 percent of moderate and liberal Republicans. The more conservative Republicans are historically most likely to vote, and it is to those loyalists that Congressional Republicans are aiming their appeals.
While no national poll can measure the mood of voters in individual Congressional districts, it can provide clues to how the election could unfold. There are signs that Republicans at this point are in by far the stronger position. Asked whether they would vote for the Republican candidate or the Democratic candidate in their Congressional district, 39 percent of registered voters said the Republican and 44 percent said the Democrat. But as other conditions are applied, such as past voting behavior, attention to the ongoing campaign and certainty of voting in November, those numbers become more favorable to Republicans. The loosest definition of a likely voter produces a split of 44 percent Republican to 43 percent Democratic.
When conditions are applied that reflect typical turnout in a midterm election -- that is, with about 34 percent of eligible voters casting ballots -- the Republican advantage is 50 percent to 41 percent. If turnout is unusually low, the gap would widen to 53 percent to 41 percent.
Americans say the firestorm that has enveloped the White House is dominating the nation's political and policy agenda, and preventing necessary work from getting accomplished. Worries about the inquiry and related issues like declining values have eclipsed other concerns, including the economy, education and crime. Nearly two-thirds of the public said the inquiry has prevented the White House and Congress from doing any other work.
The public wants Mr. Clinton to finish his term even if it turns out that he committed perjury. Twenty-nine percent want him to apologize; 31 percent want him to resign; 26 percent want the matter dropped, and only 11 percent want Congress to move ahead with impeachment proceedings.
One poll respondent who is squarely against impeachment hearings is Martin Valle, 72, a retired military technician from Hanford, Calif. "If he did lie, he was just trying to protect himself -- any man would answer that question in the same way," said Mr. Valle, a Democrat. "I don't consider this an impeachable offense."
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Tuesday and Wednesday with 960 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number to permit access both to listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults. For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for Southerners, it is plus or minus six percentage points. For residents of the Northeast, or the Midwest or the West, it is seven percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

CITING GLOBAL SLOWDOWN, UCAR WILL CLOSE THREE PLANTS

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
UCAR International Inc., a maker of graphite and carbon electrodes for the steel industry, said yesterday that it was closing plants in Ontario, Germany and Russia, eliminating 950 jobs as part of a worldwide bid to cut costs. UCAR, which is based in Danbury, Conn., attributed the cuts to the continued slowdown in the global economy, which has eroded demand for steel and graphite electrodes. The cuts will save $24 million next year, and $33 million a year starting in 2000, the company said. Costs associated with the revamping will lower third-quarter earnings by $150 million before taxes.

HEADLINE: A Racial Gap at Southern Colleges

 BODY:

To the Editor:
For Brent Staples (Editorial Observer, Sept. 20) to note that the University of Alabama-Birmingham's 22 percent black enrollment is the highest among major research institutions in the region is faint praise indeed. Alabama's college-age population is 31.6 percent black. 
 Alabama's public universities awarded 18 doctoral degrees to blacks in 1994-95, up from 15 in 1976-77. These three additional degrees may be a 20 percent increase, but it is hardly progress.
The Southern Education Foundation report emphasizes that Alabama is not unique. Black representation among freshmen at flagship institutions in the 19 states studied was less than 10 percent. So, too, was the representation of blacks among faculty.

Vital Lesson For Students Is Workaday

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
FEW eyebrows should have been raised, and most likely few were, when a recent survey showed that New York business leaders have meager faith in the city's public schools. Even so, it was hard to keep shoulders from sagging after the late-August release of the study, commissioned by the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce.
By 3 to 1, employers found public school graduates lacking in essential skills. They complained about young workers speaking poorly, writing poorly, performing basic arithmetic poorly and in general behaving poorly, because no one ever showed them the virtues of being polite, dressing appropriately and showing up on time. 
 True, nearly half those surveyed also said that the situation had improved a bit in the last few years. But over all, minuses outweighed pluses. A senior executive of an advertising agency filled out his questionnaire this way:
"It is almost impossible to hire competent clerical and/or entry help for administrative work from the New York City schools. Our recent successful hires were from Illinois, Toronto, Ireland etc."
Again, none of this will come as a shock to many New Yorkers. They have long grown inured to cashiers who have trouble giving correct change, to receptionists who need five minutes to take a simple message because they can barely spell, to file clerks who have to think hard about whether G comes before H or the other way around.
But even if not breathtakingly new, the business study hovered like a chilling specter over a symposium in Chelsea yesterday on how to make the city's young people more competitive in today's labor market. About 200 people representing various city offices, business groups and nonprofit providers of social services turned out for the conference, which was held at Covenant House, the youth shelter and counseling agency on West 17th Street.
If there was a recurring theme in the wide-ranging discussions, it was that programs are sorely needed to prepare young people for the real world. "You've got to connect people to the world of work," said John Rakis, who runs the South Forty Corporation, a nonprofit group that helps former prison inmates find jobs.
It isn't as though jobs are not there, everyone agreed. And it isn't, many also agreed, as though you can get away with glibly blaming racism for every problem facing the city's hundreds of thousands of job-seeking black and Hispanic youths. With unemployment lower than it has been in a long time, many employers are ready to gobble up anyone willing and able to work. Just stroll through Manhattan and try counting all the stores and restaurants with "help wanted" signs hanging in their front windows.
Steven Feldman, a senior official at the Board of Education, agreed that the schools must do more to make sure that their graduates can function in a modern service economy. The higher standards that Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has set for both students and teachers are part of the answer, Mr. Feldman said. But he added, "We've also got to motivate business to get involved in the public school system."
"In a sense, we've redefined education," he said. "We've redefined the school as a workplace."
WHAT they learn in the classroom will carry young people just so far, argued Edward DeJesus, an official of a Washington-based group called the National Youth Employment Coalition. "They don't just need a job," he said. "They need new rules for living."
In other words, it must be made obvious to them that nobody, whether a store customer or a bank officer, is going to turn over his money to someone who has three rings in his nose or who insists on talking and dressing as though he were a gangster -- even if he spells it gangsta. How, Mr. DeJesus asked, can someone expect to be trusted if he insists on "mean mugging," forever scowling in an attempt to intimidate the world?
"Young people are committing economic suicide when they're out there engaged in the street life," he said. "We can't be afraid to tell them that." If parents fail to shoulder that burden, he said, programs must be created to pick up the slack.
Things will improve, Mr. Feldman predicted, but it will take time. "The problem is that changing the schools is like knitting a sweater while you're wearing it," he said. But then, he added, no one thought the task would be easy. Just critical.

HEADLINE: View From Abroad: U.S. Policy Sapped by Scandal

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Ask in Foggy Bottom, ask in Whitehall, ask on the Quai d'Orsay, ask at the Kremlin, and you get the same deeply discreet answer: No, of course, Bill Clinton's personal and political troubles have not impaired the capacity of the United States to conduct foreign policy. But scratch a little deeper, push a little harder, and you discover that diplomats and politicians in most of the world's major nations are worried sick by the spectacle of a distracted President in Washington at a moment when, in their view at least, bold American leadership is all but indispensable.
"The world requires an end to this mawkish nonsense," said Christopher Patten, the last British Governor of Hong Kong, a top-level Tory politician and a newly minted author who is traveling in the United States to promote his book, "East and West." 
 "Most of the time Europeans like to poke sticks through the bars at the United States," he added. "It makes us feel important. We only realize how much we need you when things go wrong, like now."
Hubert Vedrine, the French Foreign Minister, spoke of "a world that isn't getting any stronger, with 25 regional conflicts involving 40 countries, states in the process of disintegration, a spreading financial crisis." He added: "What we need is strong leadership in all our countries, starting with the United States. For us, what is worrying is the guerrilla war between the Congress and the President, which has been going on for a long time."
The ambassador in Washington of one of the closest allies of the United States, speaking on condition of anonymity, used blunter language. He said, "You'd have to be deaf, dumb, blind and a mental defective not to see that Clinton has been weakened in his capacity to lead, at home and abroad."
So the United States can speak with one voice if serious crises need to be addressed this fall and winter, while impeachment proceedings may be taking place, the ambassador urged that the White House hold intensified foreign-policy briefings for Republican leaders in Congress, starting now.
"There are many complex problems in the world that were not able to be solved even before these events, and we shouldn't confuse the two," Mr. Vedrine cautioned a group of reporters at breakfast in Manhattan on Wednesday. "But that is my answer today. Will this affect America's capacity in the future? I hope not."
Some officials insist that Mr. Clinton has not been distracted at all. For example, Alistair Campbell, spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, said after Mr. Blair and Mr. Clinton had talked at the United Nations in New York on Monday, the very day that Mr. Clinton's grand jury testimony was broadcast: "The Prime Minister found him totally focused and able to focus, and engaged on all the issues where he needs to be engaged."
But the calculus is a bit more complicated than that. It involves many questions, of which the President's ability to concentrate is only one. Can he spare the time, for instance, to rally international coalitions? Can he influence Congressional action on foreign policy? Will all his actions abroad be interpreted in unfriendly quarters at home, like the bombing raids on Afghanistan and Sudan, as mere ploys to divert attention from the Lewinsky case and impeachment hearings?
One thing is clear in almost every capital: A crippled President is good news for no one. Gratitude for past support was one element in the standing ovation Mr. Clinton got at the United Nations; it was led by Foreign Minister Rosario Green of Mexico, which the Clinton Administration bailed out of a financial crisis nearly three years ago. But the applause was also designed, some delegates said, to strengthen Mr. Clinton's hand at a time of trouble.
People in different countries fret about different issues.
A top-ranking State Department official said that proposals for fresh initiatives in two of the most difficult situations, those in Kosovo and in Iraq, have been on President Clinton's desk for some time. He would not say how long, but he commented: "We need action, and in normal times, we would have had it. But these are not normal times, as you may have noticed."
The United States has sat quietly by while Saddam Hussein expelled United Nations arms inspectors, having said previously that it would not accept such action, and it has failed so far to intervene to slow Serbian attacks upon ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Some Europeans think Mr. Clinton's hands are tied.
"He cannot order retaliation against Islamic terrorism without raising the suspicion of it being a reckless political expedient," wrote Alberto Ronchey, the former head of the publisher Rizzoli RCS, in the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera.
An Asian diplomat complained bitterly about what he called "intolerably late, intolerably inadequate" American action in the case of Anwar Ibrahim, the former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister, who was dismissed this month from his positions in the Cabinet and the ruling political party, then arrested in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday on charges of sexual misconduct and treason.
Washington's first official comment came only today, in the form of a statement by the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, expressing concern over the detention of Mr. Ibrahim under Malaysia's Internal Security Act, which dates from the insurgency there decades ago. Asian representatives in Washington wanted a tougher American line, enunciated by Mr. Clinton.
The international financial crisis is another cause for anxiety, although some foreign officials continue to suggest that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin can manage American economic policy with minimal White House help.
Others suggest, though they offer no convincing proof, that if Mr. Clinton had not been preoccupied this summer when troubles broke out in Asia, Russia and then Brazil, he might have been able to react much more aggressively, whether that would have solved the problem or not. And his legal troubles are widely blamed abroad for the President's inability to persuade Congress to authorize an additional $18 billion for the International Monetary Fund.
Gianni De Michelis, the former Italian Foreign Minister who was convicted of corruption in the early 1990's, said that signs of Mr. Clinton's weakness on the international front were already evident in the I.M.F. setback.
No stranger to the political fallout of legal entanglements, Mr. De Michelis said: "If Japan blows up, we are facing an unthinkable disaster. It would obviously be useful to have at the head of the most powerful Government in the world someone who can deal with world crises with a free hand."
While Mr. Clinton's efforts to open a debate on the financial crisis have been welcomed in Brazil, the country's Finance Minister, Luiz Felipe Lampreia, said that the President's ability to lead that debate has been reduced.
Brazilian officials, the Finance Minister said, were "extremely concerned with the fact that President Clinton is weakened internationally."
Some on Capitol Hill believe that the Lewinsky affair has contributed to the looming failure of President Clinton's bid for wider powers to negotiate trade treaties. The House is scheduled to vote on Friday on so-called fast-track authorization legislation, with a defeat widely anticipated.
Representative Walter B. Jones Jr., a North Carolina Republican, said he had been leaning against widening Presidential powers last year but was now a sure "no" vote. His views had changed because of his constituents' views, he said, adding: "They don't want to see this President given any new authority."

Jason Martin

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:

Robert Miller Gallery
41 East 57th Street
Manhattan
Through Oct. 10
 Seen in their New York gallery debut, Jason Martin's smartly coiffed monochrome paintings have so many precedents, and so much intelligence, economy and all-round optical jazziness they are almost interesting. 
 A young British artist, Mr. Martin paints by covering largish surfaces of stainless steel, aluminum and plexiglass with (usually) a single color of oil paint; he then pulls a fine, sometimes specially made comblike tool across the wet paint, creating striations that move up and down according to various intervals and rhythms.
The electric-blue glide of "Patrol" wavers only slightly but nervously and consistently, like the results of lie-detector tests taken by the guiltless or dozens of flat-lining heart monitors. The marigold yellow surfaces of "Cha-Cha" and "Samba" have a lot of wave action; their wide undulations gleam, as if three or four spotlights were situated just above, or below, them. Elsewhere, as in the burgundy "Boudoir," the surface ripples, like a curtain. And occasionally the raking tool is lifted and the surface broken, creating dramatic fissures of fringed paint.
The artists brought to mind by Mr. Martin's no-hands technique and glistening effects include Jackson Pollock and Robert Ryman, Alan Charlton, Bridget Riley and David Budd, an American painter whose monochrome surfaces accrue in small palette-knifed, light-deflecting strokes, as well as contemporary painters like James Hyde.
But mostly one comes away with a sense of sensational, tacky retro-chic, as suggested by titles like "Stripsearch," "Harlot" and "Slapjack" and corroborated by the slickness of the paintings themselves. The problem seems to be one of taste. Mr. Martin needs to raise his sights higher so that his paintings can transcend the gimmicky mechanics of their own making. At this point they actually do seem to have been made by machines and have the brief dazzle of a Slinky toy making its way down the stairs. ROBERTA SMITH

A brief art review in Weekend on Sept. 25 about the English painter Jason Martin referred incorrectly to his show at the Robert Miller Gallery in Manhattan, through Oct. 10. It is not his New York gallery debut; the resume provided by his London gallery omitted a 1995 solo show at the Cristinerose Gallery, which was then in SoHo and is now in Chelsea.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Analysts See Positive Signs In Latin American Turmoil

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Sept. 25

 BODY:
With increasing signs that world lenders are preparing to rescue Brazil from a potential financial meltdown, Wall Street analysts say that outflows of capital are slowing from stock markets from Mexico City to Buenos Aires.
They caution that the region's economies and markets may not have reached bottom yet. Corporate profits throughout Latin America are falling, a devaluation in Venezuela may be looming and a financial collapse in Brazil is less likely but still possible. 
 Latin American mutual funds have already lost $851 million, or 63 percent, of their asset value this year. Nevertheless, some say they believe they are beginning to see the bottom.
"The panic selling has subsided," said James A. Upton, Latin American equity strategist for Credit Suisse First Boston, who cautioned that he expected continued volatility.
"There's still a lot of risk out there," said Eduardo Cabrera, Merrill Lynch's chief Latin America equity strategist, noting the region's continued vulnerability. "The global situation is still turbulent but you have big brother finally stepping up."
The beginnings of cautious optimism are based partly on the view that the Governments of Mexico, Argentina and Peru have responded smartly to protect their currencies with timely rises in interest rates and that several of the region's largest countries are likely to have positive growth rates next year. They note that Chile, a traditional leader in regional economic policy-making, last week lifted a key capital control costly to foreign investors in another sign that Latin America would not veer from free-market policies adopted over the last decade.
But more than anything else, the more positive view tentatively emerging is based on expectations that the International Monetary Fund and other lenders will come to Brazil's rescue with an aid package that could exceed $50 billion and that the Federal Reserve will soon lower interest rates to help the United States and world economies. A loosening of United States monetary policy, the analysts hope, should indirectly raise the prices of several of Latin America's lagging exports such as oil, copper, paper and steel.
However all bets are off, Wall Street analysts say, if Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, does not win re-election as expected on Oct. 4. They also say he must fulfill his recent promises of an aggressive program to slash Government spending and to raise taxes to relieve the burden of a fiscal deficit that represents 7 percent of gross domestic product. With a population of 160 million and 30 percent of Latin America's total economy, anything that happens in Brazil reverberates through the region.
"Brazil was at the brink of a devaluation a few weeks ago, and that meant that all emerging markets were on the brink," said Jorge O. Mariscal, chief Latin American investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs. "But now, all the things the markets were clamoring for seem to be happening."
Capital is still leaving Latin American stock markets, but analysts say the flow is slowing. In the week ended Wednesday, Latin American mutual funds suffered an outflow of $15.6 million, slightly better than the average of $18.3 million a week over the last month. James Barrineau, Latin American equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said the slight improvement came because "we've started getting hints of an aid package for Brazil."
Fears of financial collapse precipitated by Russia's devaluation and debt moratorium, followed by expectations that Brazil would avert that fate with an international bailout, have driven Brazil's stock market on a wild ride the last two months. Between late July and the first 11 days of this month, the market fell by better than 50 percent, only to recover most of its losses in recent days. Then it stumbled again Thursday and today for other reasons, mainly the prospects of the collapse of an American hedge fund. The Bovespa closed today at 6,711.52, down 132.83 for the day and more than 34 percent for the year. Mr. Mariscal and several other analysts said they expected a recession as a result of a recent doubling of interest rates that will depress corporate profits next year.
But while Wall Street analysts do not expect a sustained rally in Brazilian stocks, they say that as long as Brazil does not devalue, they like the economic prospects for much of the rest of the region, particularly Argentina, Mexico and Chile. Wall Street analysts say continued drops in the stock markets in all three countries should be buffered by the ready pools of cash available from their private pension fund systems.
A rise in Argentine interest rates in recent months to defend the peso has depressed auto production and construction, and is drying up consumer and mortgage credit. Jane Heap, Latin America strategist for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, has lowered her estimates for Argentina's economic growth rate from 6 percent to 4 percent this year, and from 4.5 percent to 3 percent in 1999. But she expresses hopeful optimism.
"It certainly is not a recession," Ms. Heap said. "What is most important about Argentina is that there is no way the peso's peg to the dollar will break even in the worst case scenario."
With Argentine stocks beaten down by more than 40 percent this year, and several Argentine companies beginning to aggressively buy back their own shares, several analysts said they saw the potential for higher stock prices. They cautioned, though, that any investments in emerging markets were risky at this point. Analysts also said the Mexican economy should grow modestly next year, despite high interest rates, even if oil prices did not rise much.
Mr. Barrineau forecast a 10 percent drop in Mexican corporate profits this year compared with a 4 percent drop in corporate profits in Latin America as a whole. "However, next year, if Brazil does not devalue, 10 percent corporate earnings growth in Mexico is doable," he said.

HEADLINE: The Half-Life of Presidential Scandals

BYLINE: By Michael Kazin; Michael Kazin, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center, is the author of "The Populist Persuasion: An American History."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Presidential scandals have always made for grand, or at least gaudy, public theater. For well over a century, Americans have been captivated by tales of the powerful brought low by their basest appetites -- for money, sex or absolute domination. But do these imbroglios help the opposing party win elections? Do they alter the course of our political life?
In the short run, the answer clearly is no. Between the end of the Civil War and the end of the cold war, four Republican administrations were rocked by scandal. But in each case, a Republican candidate won the next Presidential election and, more important, his party still set the tone of political debate. 
 In the early 1870's, several Cabinet officials in the Grant Administration were indicted for receiving kickbacks from contractors, and the Secretary of War was impeached. Grant made excuses for his subordinates' wrongdoing and helped them elude punishment. Still, Republicans, won the next two Presidential elections, albeit by exceedingly close votes. Moreover, they were able to impose high tariffs, which most Democrats loathed.
Half a century later, Warren Harding's Administration was gravely damaged by an Interior Secretary who sold oil leases to his friends and skimmed off hefty profits, and by an Attorney General who escaped a bribery conviction only by burning incriminating documents. The President suffered a heart attack midway through his term, and many said he died of despair.
But Harding's successor, Calvin Coolidge, won the next election in a landslide, and Herbert Hoover repeated the performance four years later.
Neither have more recent scandals -- Watergate and Iran-contra -- hurt Republicans in the long run. True, the Democrats gained 46 seats in the House in the election held four months after Richard Nixon's resignation, and Jimmy Carter eked out a victory over Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, two years later.
But President Carter was unable to buck the continuing surge of conservative sentiment, and the Democrats surrendered both the White House and the Senate in 1980.
The Iran-contra scandal in the Reagan Administration had the slightest impact of all: it wasn't even an important issue in the next Presidential campaign, which took place only a year after top Reagan officials were indicted. George Bush lost the 1992 election because of the faltering economy, not because of his reputed role in the Iran-contra fiasco.
Why do such shocking scandals leave so limited an impression? Americans may get angry at the immorality of their leaders, but they usually vote based on self-interest -- as they perceive it. It takes a social upheaval -- a Civil War, a Great Depression, an implosion of liberalism -- to alter partisan habits and usher in a new political era.
Thus, few Republicans abandoned their party, whatever their misgivings about Grant, Harding, Nixon or Reagan, or the men surrounding them. In fact, loyalists often rally around an embattled President, if only to turn back the common enemy. That certainly has been the case in the present scandal, as Democrats condemned Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, for obsessively reporting the details of the President's sex life.
But if White House scandals don't help the opposition party gain power, they do have an effect on the political system as a whole. The thievery of Grant's men galvanized a generation of muckraking reformers. Similarly, the Harding debacle emboldened future New Dealers to rein in big business. Watergate increased cynicism about government itself -- and led Congress to pass a hasty campaign reform law to which we owe the curse of political action committees.
It's too soon to divine what the larger political meaning of the Clinton scandal will be. But the polls suggest that, as in the past, most voters separate policies they like from the personal failings of the man behind them.
Perhaps Mr. Clinton's greatest legacy will be to complete the process of shrinking Presidents down to human size: future occupants of the White House may find that Americans view them not as role models, but merely as public servants. For the ferociously ambitious men and women who seek the job, that might be the biggest scandal of all.

HEADLINE: Coke Expects Flat Earnings This Quarter

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Painting a bleaker picture than many analysts had foreseen, the Coca-Cola Company disclosed yesterday that its short-term business results had been severely battered by global economic upheaval.
In a statement after an early-morning meeting with Wall Street analysts in New York, the company warned that earnings would be flat in the third quarter, compared with the corresponding period last year, and would fall in the fourth quarter compared with last year. About two-thirds of Coke's earnings come from markets outside the United States. 
 Coke said its worldwide case sales volume would grow only 3 percent to 4 percent in the third quarter, which ends next Wednesday, compared with annual growth forecasts of 7 percent to 8 percent. Many analysts had thought the third-quarter volume would come in around 5 percent to 6 percent. Last year, sales grew 11 percent in the corresponding period.
"While management is moving to adjust their business plans in some of the more chaotic markets, the impact will be severe in the third quarter and even more so in the fourth quarter," said Michael J. Branca, a beverage analyst for Lehman Brothers, who called Coke's presentation yesterday "somber but realistic." Following the meeting, Mr. Branca said he had lowered his earnings forecast for this year from $1.53 a share to $1.46, and ratcheted his 1999 projection lower as well.
Coke stock fell more than $3 a share as the stock market opened yesterday, but largely recovered to close at $56.1875, down 50 cents in heavy trading. The stock has fallen 36 percent since July 15, when it closed at $88.9375.
Pepsico, Coke's main rival, issued its own third-quarter volume results yesterday as well. The company normally does not release those numbers ahead of its earnings results, which are not due for several weeks. In Pepsi's case, global beverage volume rose 5 percent to 6 percent for the third quarter, though most of that reflects sales in the United States, since Pepsi's presence abroad is much smaller than Coke's.
"We had the data, so we thought it would be useful to put it out," said Richard M. Detwiler Jr., a Pepsico spokesman. At the same time, Pepsico also announced appointments for its bottling business, which many in the soft-drink business expect to be spun off as a publicly traded company before long.
Coke's news seemed to surprise many analysts, not in its general outlook but in the depth of the damage done in a relatively short time. But most analysts said the company's long-range prospects remained impressive, and those fundamentals were emphasized in the meeting by M. Douglas Ivester, Coke's chairman and chief executive, and James E. Chestnut, the company's chief financial officer.
"There's no doubt that the near term is worse than we thought," said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. "And there's no doubt that it took them a little bit by surprise." She said Mr. Ivester seemed "taken aback by the degree of weakness in the global economy," but added, "I would hardly call him alarmed or worried."
Company executives gave no guidance about 1999 earnings, Ms. Solomon said. "They said they expect to get their volumes within 7 to 8 percent," she said. "But earnings are going to be tough."
Mr. Branca said the company indicated it would take unspecified steps to manage the economic difficulties.
Such steps could include cutting prices in some markets and increasing marketing outlays in others.
Another analyst, Bill Pecoriello of Sanford Bernstein, said he left the meeting feeling "still very confident in the long-term fundamentals, and knowing Coke will emerge stronger when these global economies turn around." Still, he said, "I remain cautious for the short run due to continued uncertainties."
Among the trouble spots for Coke is Japan, which is suffering one of its worst economic declines and which accounts for 17 percent of Coke's profits. "Management is hopeful that Government actions, such as a reduced consumption tax and more upbeat political P.R., could meaningfully improve that business," Mr. Branca said. Another worry is Germany, which accounts for 8 percent to 9 percent of profits. Sales by Coke's Greater Europe group are expected to increase just 1 percent to 2 percent in the third quarter.
"The near-term numbers are weaker than I thought, both in volume and earnings," said Marc Cohen, a beverage analyst for Goldman, Sachs. "That being said, I was somewhat encouraged by the enthusiasm they showed for being able to grow 7 to 8 percent from their 1998 levels." The company's discussion of the possibility that it would accelerate its stock repurchasing program was also encouraging, he said.
At Pepsi, the changes announced yesterday will make Craig Weatherup, now the global chairman and chief executive of Pepsi-Cola, the leader of the bottling company, to be called the Pepsi Bottling Group. It will comprise all of the bottling operations Pepsi owns, which handle 58 percent of the company's domestic volume. Mr. Weatherup, 53, will be chairman and chief executive of Pepsi Bottling.
Craig Jung, 45, president of Pepsi's bottling operations since last year, will become chief operating officer of Pepsi Bottling. In addition, John Cahill, 41, was named executive vice president and chief financial officer of the new bottling company.
Pepsi shares, which have been trading in the $29 to $31 range for most of the month, fell 56.25 cents, to $30.4375.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Ends WithSmall Gain on Expectation of a Rate Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks recovered from sharp morning losses yesterday to end the session and the week with gains.
Investors continued to be skittish about the potential fallout from the near-collapse of a large hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, and about financial crises in Asia and Russia. Expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates next week, however, overcame such worries. 
 "Everyone is counting on Greenspan lowering interest rates," said Joe Joshi, chief investment officer at Systematic Financial Management in Fort Lee, N.J., which oversees $1 billion. "That will show he will not let a recession happen." Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and other Fed policy makers are scheduled meet on interest rate policy on Tuesday.
Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee on Wednesday that deteriorating economies abroad "have increased the possibility that the slowdown in the growth of the U.S. economy will be more than sufficient to hold inflation in check." His comments were seen as a signal that short-term rates would be cut.
A rate cut "will stimulate the economy," allowing corporate profits to grow, said Martin Sass, president of M. D. Sass Investor Services, which manages $13 billion.
Stocks tumbled in early trading, following selloffs in Asian and European markets. Stocks fell 3.4 percent in Japan and 1.7 percent in Hong Kong. European markets, however, recovered some of their losses in late trading. London stocks closed down 2.06 percent, while in Paris, stocks ended down 2.09 percent.
After dropping as much as 112 points in early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.78 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent, to 8,028.77. I.B.M. led the Dow higher, but the average was dragged down in part by Coca-Cola, which warned yesterday that second-half earnings would be disappointing.
I.B.M. rose 2 15/16 , to 133 1/2 -- accounting for nearly half the Dow's gain -- while Coke fell 1/2, to 56 3/16 . For the week, the Dow was up 133.11 points, or 1.7 percent.
Broader market indexes were also higher yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 2.03, or two-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,044.75. The Nasdaq composite index rose 23.35, or 1.4 percent, to 1,743.59.
But smaller stocks were weaker. The Russell 2000 smaller-stock index fell 1.23 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent, to 369.02.
Dell Computer rose 2 3/4, to an all-time high of 66 1/16 , after executives said the economic slump in Asia would not impede sales growth.
Some American financial shares declined after Credit Suisse Group and Dresdner Bank joined UBS in disclosing that they would write off investments in Long-Term Capital Management. Chase Manhattan fell 7/8, to 45 1/2, and First Chicago NBD lost 1 15/16 , to 71 3/4.
J. P. Morgan rose 1 15/16 , to 88 15/16 , after diving 6 1/8 Thursday. The Wall Street Journal reported that J. P. Morgan had covered its exposure to Long-Term Capital through Treasury bills and cash.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Prices Higher
(By Dow Jones)
Treasury prices ended higher yesterday despite gains in stocks, as uncertainty over the stability of global financial markets and expectations of a cut in interest rates continued to underpin the market.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 17/32 , to 105 24/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.12 percent from 5.16 percent.
Bonds started higher across the curve as stocks opened lower. Shorter maturities, however, fell during the session on profit taking.
But the short end of the market rallied late in the day, as traders and investors continued to be optimistic that Federal Reserve policy makers would cut short-term rates by as much as a half-point next week.

HEADLINE: Home Resales Down but Still Remain High

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Home resales declined last month but remained near a record level, while consumer spending rebounded, a sign of the economy's stamina.
"Americans are a bunch of happy campers," said Joel Naroff, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Philadelphia. "At least right now, we're not seeing much impact from Asia. There's no doubt that people are spending money. They've got it; they're spending it." 
 The National Association of Realtors said today that home resales fell 3.7 percent in August from July, to an annual rate of 4.73 million units, remaining near the record rate of 4.91 million units set in July, when sales grew 3.6 percent.
In another report, the Commerce Department said personal spending rose six-tenths of 1 percent last month after having declined one-tenth of 1 percent in July. Americans' incomes rose half a percent in August, faster than July's gain of four-tenths of 1 percent. The August figures were bolstered by a rebound in car sales after the end of two factory strikes against the General Motors Corporation.
Together, the reports suggested continued economic strength. Policy makers at the Federal Reserve, though, expect a slowdown as the American economy feels the effects of the economic crisis in Asia and some other parts of the world. Comments this week by the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, have led investors to expect a cut in interest rates when the central bank's policy committee meets on Tuesday.
"If the Fed does ease, it's not because of problems in the U.S. economy," said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. "Midway through the third quarter, the U.S. economy was still showing decent momentum."
That is likely to change, however. Just today, the New York Fed's president, William McDonough, said he expected economic growth to slow to an annual rate of 2 to 2.5 percent in the second half of this year and all of next year, well below the 3.7 percent rate in the first half of this year.
Housing has been strong in recent months because of low interest rates. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 6.64 percent this week, the lowest level since 1967 and down from 6.66 percent a week earlier.
The home-resale data are regarded as an important gauge of the economy's direction. Sales of previously owned homes account for 85 percent of all home sales, and home buyers generally make significant purchases of furniture, appliances and other household goods, providing a further lift to the economy.
Consumer spending is key because it accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity. Spending rose at a 6.1 percent annual pace in the second quarter, unchanged from the first quarter. But that is not expected to continue in the second half.
Consumer spending on big-ticket durable goods rose 1.1 percent in August, in contrast to July's 4.6 percent decline. Analysts had expected a rebound as car sales recovered from the effects of the G.M. strike.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Gain in South Asia

 BODY:
Four months after shocking the world with their nuclear tests, India and Pakistan have declared their intention to sign a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. The announcement could reduce tensions in one of the most volatile parts of the world. But before the United States can lift economic sanctions imposed in response to the nuclear blasts last May, it should press India and Pakistan to reach additional curbs on the production of weapons-grade nuclear material and the development and deployment of missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
The announcement was delivered in separate speeches Wednesday and Thursday at the United Nations by Prime Ministers Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and A. B. Vajpayee of India. It was a major turnabout for India in particular, since Pakistan has long said it would sign the treaty if India would. India had denounced the treaty as unacceptable as long as the United States and other countries refused to eliminate their own nuclear weapons. 
 Since both Mr. Vajpayee and Mr. Sharif sit atop shaky governing coalitions, it took political courage for them to make their pledges. Mr. Vajpayee, as head of a Hindu nationalist coalition Government, is under pressure from his own camp to press India's claim to be seen an equal with China and other nuclear powers. The Clinton Administration also deserves praise for getting two countries that have fought three wars in the last 50 years to achieve a measure of progress. One key to the agreement was that India is not being challenged by the United States in its demand that the problem of Kashmir, India's only Muslim-dominated state, be settled in negotiations with Pakistan without intervention from the United Nations or other outside influences.
Tremendous obstacles remain in the way of a true rapprochement on the Asian subcontinent. Both Mr. Vajpayee and Mr. Sharif will no doubt try to link their signatures to promises of American sanctions being eased and other steps. President Clinton was supposed to visit India and Pakistan this fall, a trip this page urged him to reconsider after the nuclear blasts. Such a trip may still be premature, but the President should keep up the pressure for progress and schedule a trip, perhaps next year, as a spur to Indian and Pakistani agreements. With rising tensions in South Asia, including threats of a war between Afghanistan and Iran, the region looms as a more important security concern than ever.
Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton faces a tough battle in pressing ratification of the treaty in the Senate, where many Republicans are skeptical of its effectiveness. Politically distracted as it is, the Administration should redouble its efforts to win ratification of this important nuclear accord. Surely the Senate opponents will not want the United States to align itself with North Korea as the only holdouts on one of the most significant barriers against the spread of nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Casts The Congress As Do-Nothing

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Cheered by polls that appear to show the beginnings of a backlash against Congressional Republicans for a seeming preoccupation with the Lewinsky scandal, President Clinton today criticized them for a lack of action on spending bills and other legislation.
In remarks before leaving the White House this morning for a three-day fund-raising swing on behalf of Democratic candidates, Mr. Clinton said, "By failing to meet its most basic governing responsibility, the Republican majority in Congress has its priorities wrong: partisanship over progress, politics over people." 
 Both in Washington and at a campaign fund-raiser here in Chicago, Mr. Clinton laced his comments with a sharp partisan edge, hoping to gain an advantage with the public as Republicans appear to be moving toward authorizing an impeachment inquiry against him. In his remarks today, as in others late this week, there were no apologies for his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky or for his seven months of misleading statements about it.
As he tries to turn attention away from the events that threaten his Presidency, Mr. Clinton has authorized his lawyers to negotiate a financial settlement of Paula Corbin Jones's sexual misconduct suit, whose dismissal is now pending appeal. If successful in putting that matter behind him, Mr. Clinton could argue to Congress that he has resolved the accusations that ultimately exposed his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, although what effect a settlement would have on the impeachment inquiry remains unclear.
Today the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, resisted any notion of short-cutting the House deliberations on impeachment, saying the process should be allowed to go forward. And he returned fire on the President's criticism of Republicans, deriding Mr. Clinton as "fund-raiser in chief" and accusing him of neglecting his own responsibilities as he maneuvers to salvage his political future.
"The President comes out at a time when he needs cooperation with -- and we need cooperation from him -- with the Congress, and he takes a gratuitous slap, jumps on a plane and runs off for three days of fund-raising," Mr. Lott said. "Now, is he the fund-raiser in chief, or is he the Commander in Chief?"
"Now, we're doing our work," the Senator said. "Maybe he just hasn't noticed; he's been distracted. And what he's trying to do is distract attention from his problems by trying to, you know, push the blame off on somebody else."
Another Republican, Representative Anne M. Northup of Kentucky, said Mr. Clinton had failed to exert his influence to help win passage of fast-track trade legislation, which the President supports but a majority of Democrats oppose.
"Where is he?" Ms. Northup said. "He's out on a political junket."
Barry Toiv, the deputy White House press secretary, said it was the Republican leadership, not Mr. Clinton, that was responsible for gridlock in Washington.
"I don't know how he can say that," Mr. Toiv said of Mr. Lott's criticism. "It's not the President who has eked out a total of one appropriations bill in nine months, with only five days left to go in the fiscal year. It's not the President who is five months behind in enacting a budget. It's not the President who has failed to approve education spending."
"Look," Mr. Toiv added, "the Congress needs to get its work done. I think that's the point the President was trying to make today."
Mr. Clinton said there were still a few days left for Congress to act before breaking in early October for electioneering. But he held out little hope that Republican leaders would heed his call, and appeared delighted to have a slow-moving target at which to aim his fire.
He said he signed a stopgap spending bill this morning to keep the Government running after the fiscal year ends at midnight next Wednesday, but called the emergency measure "a regrettable sign" that Republicans were "moving in the wrong direction."
He was particularly critical of a House Republican plan to cut taxes by $80 billion over five years before the future solvency of the Social Security trust fund is assured.
The President appeared emboldened by recent polls that show approval of Congress slipping while his own popularity surges in the aftermath of the televising on Monday of his videotaped grand jury testimony. His most recent public comments reflect a calculation that he can gain politically by contrasting his focus on public business with Congress's heavy diet of impeachment talk.
On a separate tour with similar themes, Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned for Democrats in Colorado, Oregon, Washington and California this week. At an elementary school in Sheridan, Colo., on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton complained that Congress did not seem to have time to devote to issues like education.
"And I wish that I could have every member of Congress who is too busy -- too busy to have a hearing about school modernization, too busy to consider adding teachers to lower classroom size -- to come with me to Fort Logan," she said, referring to the school where she spoke. "They could not do that, and the result is you won't see them."
The First Lady said Congress would "rather spend time dividing our country, diverting our resources, doing anything but focusing on the real problems of America."
The President sounded the same anti-Congress theme in an appearance at an elementary school in Chicago today, accusing Republicans of inaction on legislation concerning education, health care, the environment and the global economy.
And at a fund-raiser for the Democratic nominee for governor of Illinois -- an event at which the nominee, Representative Glenn Poshard, did not appear -- Mr. Clinton said that after eight months of inaction, the Republican Congressional leadership now wanted to use the first budget surplus in decades to pass a popular tax cut on the eve of the midterm elections.
"The majority party wants to make everybody happy close to the election with a tax cut," Mr. Clinton said. "But it's not the right thing to do. Before the red ink turns to black and it dries a little bit, people want to turn around and spend it again."
Mr. Poshard, who was in Washington, spoke by telephone to the $250,000 fund-raising luncheon, held at Chicago's Mercantile Club. He said that critics would accuse him of seeking to distance himself from a President in serious political trouble but that "nothing could be further from the truth."
"I'm very proud of your work," he told Mr. Clinton. "I'm very proud of your leadership."
Mr. Poshard said he had remained in Washington to vote on Social Security and tax legislation. But he was also preparing to vote to deny the President fast-track trade authority -- the power to negotiate trade agreements that Congress may then vote only up or down, without amending.
The Congressman's position on fast track is one he has held consistently, said his press secretary, David C. Gillies. Like many other Democrats, Mr. Poshard says the Administration's trade position does not insure adequate protection for workers and the environment in less-developed countries.
Mr. Clinton will appear at five more fund-raising events for Democratic candidates this weekend, three in California and two in Texas. He also plans to spend Saturday morning with Mrs. Clinton visiting their daughter, Chelsea, a sophomore at Stanford University.
He returns to Washington late Sunday night.

HEADLINE: House Rejects Expanded Trade Power for President

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
The House today rejected legislation to give expanded trade negotiating authority to President Clinton.
The outcome, 243 to 180, seemed assured in advance, since few lawmakers had switched sides from last November, when the same bill was pulled from the House floor before it could be voted down. If anything, the measure had lost support since then. 
 Mr. Clinton badly wants the authority, which would allow him to negotiate trade agreements that Congress could accept or reject but not amend. But he did not want the Congress to deal with it now.
That is because the vast majority of House Democrats oppose the legislation. Indeed, Democrats voted against the fast-track measure today, 171 to 29, and many accused Speaker Newt Gingrich of holding a vote on legislation he knew was doomed simply to expose Democratic divisions just weeks before the Nov. 3 elections.
"Why did the Speaker insist on bringing up this bill when he knew it was going to fail?" asked Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip.
Taking to the House floor at the end of today's four-hour debate, Mr. Gingrich angrily rejected the criticisms and accused Democrats of taking orders from labor unions who are Democrats' biggest donors and most loyal supporters, and who strongly oppose the measure.
"The real issue is that your unions won't let you vote for free trade," Mr. Gingrich said.
In a statement after the vote, Mr. Gingrich criticized Mr. Clinton for not rallying Democrats to his cause. "Instead of lobbying for fast track," he said, "the President neglected our nation's long-term economic health in favor of political fund-raising."
The House legislation would have extended the authority that all Presidents since Gerald R. Ford have had in negotiating trade accords that Congress can accept or reject but not amend. Mr. Clinton let those powers lapse four years ago rather than risk a vote that would split Democrats.
Mr. Gingrich and his lieutenants lobbied hard for the trade authority this week, but Democrats said it was all show to deflect complaints from business groups and farmers upset that Republicans have balked at providing $18 billion in new financing for the International Monetary Fund.
 The Speaker flipped the accusations around, warning that a vote against the enhanced trade authority would weaken the United States in the eyes of the world economic community and further unsettle jittery currencies from Asia to Brazil.
"If this goes down and this ends up in a step toward world recession, some of us will have the comfort to know we cast the right vote," Mr. Gingrich said.
Today's debate was a shadow of last November's confrontation that dealt Mr. Clinton one of his most stinging legislative setbacks. Supporters cast the debate as a choice between protectionism and free trade in an increasingly global marketplace.
"This is an argument between those who believe Americans can compete in the world market and those who believe they can't," said Representative Gil Gutknecht, Republican of Minnesota.
Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, said, "A vote for fast track is a vote for farm families. Trade is one of the most important tools to improve the farm economy."
Democrats retorted that the trade authority failed to insure that developing nations would uphold labor and environmental standards in their quest to profit in the global market.
"Are we going to let multinational companies bargain down environmental standards around the world in the name of economic competitiveness?" asked Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey.
Democrats said granting Mr. Clinton enhanced trade negotiating authority would continue to undermine an American job market already suffering from the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1993, a conclusion that Republicans disputed.
Mr. Bonior, the Democratic whip, said, "Nafta is hurting hundreds of thousands of people on both sides of the border"

HEADLINE: AMERICANS LACKING HEALTH INSURANCE PUT AT 16 PERCENT

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Despite the booming economy, the number of people without health insurance rose sharply last year, to 43.4 million, and the proportion of Americans lacking coverage reached the highest level in a decade, 16.1 percent, the Census Bureau reported today.
After rising slightly more than 1 million a year, on the average, in the last decade, the number of uninsured people was up 1.7 million last year, the largest increase since 1992. 
 The data seem surprising at first. Robert L. Bennefield, a statistician at the Census Bureau, said, "In a healthy economy, you'd think you would have more people with jobs, and that would tend to increase coverage, so you'd see fewer people uninsured."
But he and other experts said there were several logical explanations for the rising number of uninsured. Medicaid rolls are down as stringent new laws prod people to move from welfare to work and the low-paying jobs they find often do not offer health benefits. Some employers have said they are cutting back health benefits, especially for dependents of employees, because of rising medical costs.
Even people with higher incomes are going without insurance. Households with annual incomes of $75,000 or more accounted for half the increase in the number of uninsured, the bureau said. The number of people in these upper-income households without insurance rose last year by 852,000, to 4.9 million.
The Census Bureau said that 8.1 percent of these higher-income households were uninsured last year, up from 7.6 percent in 1996. Economists said that many of these people were probably self-employed or worked for small businesses that did not provide coverage.
The number of poor people without insurance stayed about the same, 11.2 million. Nearly one-third of all poor people -- 31.6 percent -- were uninsured last year, about the same as in 1996.
The Government said that more than one of every five people was uninsured last year in six states: Texas, Arizona, Arkansas, New Mexico, California and Mississippi. By contrast, Hawaii, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Vermont had the highest rates of coverage, with fewer than 10 percent of their residents uninsured.
Expanding coverage has been a top priority for President Clinton since he took office in 1993. Since his proposal for universal health insurance died in September 1994, he has announced dozens of initiatives to achieve that goal. But he has been unable to stop the erosion in coverage, and Congress, which has passed several laws to provide health benefits in recent years, appears unlikely to do more in the near future.
Administration officials maintain that the situation would be even worse without their efforts to guarantee coverage for children and for workers who change or lose jobs.
Mr. Clinton has ordered Federal officials to redouble efforts to locate children who are eligible for Medicaid but who are not enrolled. Republicans and insurance companies, which helped to kill Mr. Clinton's plan in 1994, say they want to create new tax breaks to help people buy private insurance, but Congress has had difficulty finding the money to pay for such incentives.
The Census Bureau said that 10.7 million children were uninsured last year, about the same number as in 1996. Because of Medicare, nearly all people 65 and older have insurance coverage. So it was people 18 to 64 years old who accounted for the increase in the uninsured.
People 18 to 24 years old are least likely to have coverage, the bureau said. Thirty percent of these young adults were uninsured last year, up from 28.9 percent in 1996.
Hispanic Americans had the highest chance of being uninsured. Thirty-four percent of Hispanic people lacked insurance last year, compared with 21.5 percent of blacks and 12 percent of non-Hispanic whites.
The Census Bureau had been planning to issue a report on the data on Monday. But the raw data were posted on the Internet on Thursday. Physicians for a National Health Program, a small organization of doctors, tabulated and analyzed the data and issued its findings today.
"What's startling is the magnitude of the increase when the economy was booming," said Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, a co-founder of the organization. The group advocates universal access to health care.
Census officials and health policy experts suggested several reasons for the rising number of uninsured:
* Welfare rolls have been shrinking for several years. People on welfare automatically get Medicaid. But when they leave welfare, they often take low-paying jobs with no health benefits. These workers or their children may still be eligible for Medicaid, but they do not realize it.
* Small businesses are creating most of the nation's new jobs. But these businesses are far less likely than big companies to provide health insurance.
* Health care and insurance costs are on the rise. Cost is the reason most often cited, by individuals and employers, for not buying insurance.
Diane Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, said: "We are in a time of transition and turmoil in welfare. While many states are trying to simplify Medicaid enrollment procedures, there are still many barriers. Caseworkers seem to be under greater pressure to find people jobs than to assure they have health insurance coverage."
New York City has begun inspecting the homes of some people who apply for Medicaid, to see if they misrepresented their income, assets or living arrangements. Some advocates for the poor say it is one more obstacle to getting health insurance.
Ms. Rowland said that changes in welfare and immigration law had deterred some people from applying for Medicaid. "Noncitizens often shy away from enrolling in Medicaid," she said. "And noncitizen parents may be reluctant to seek Medicaid even for children who were born in this country and are eligible for Medicaid as citizens."
The Census Bureau's report is based on interviews with 50,000 households chosen to be representative of the nation as a whole.
The Government said that 43.3 percent of the poor were covered by Medicaid at some time last year, down from 45.5 percent in 1996.
Many poor people do not qualify for Medicaid. Many states set income limits far below the poverty level. Childless adults are often ineligible even if they have very low incomes.
The Census Bureau found that the number of people with employer-sponsored health insurance rose last year, to 165.1 million, from 163.2 million in 1996. More people are working, and employers may be providing health benefits for some of those workers, even as they eliminate benefits for some dependents.

Hedge Fund's Risks Studied
Long-Term Capital Management, the big hedge fund rescued with a $3.5 billion infusion by a consortium of Wall Street banks this week, made complex bets on international financial markets with a total value considerably higher than previously estimated, said financiers who studied its books. They said that at the end of August the firm had about $2.2 billion in capital. But it borrowed money from banks to purchase securities with a total value of $125 billion, a degree of leverage considered unusually high in the hedge fund world. The financiers said the fund used those securities as collateral to enter into speculative financial contracts valued at $1.25 trillion. A1

HEADLINE: Fiscal Stones, Glass Houses: Bailout Points Finger at U.S.

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
If there has been a single refrain as economic shock waves rolled around the world for the last year, it is the importance of spotting and addressing financial risks before they get out of control.
But after a year of demands from the United States that Asia strengthen banking supervision and provide better information to investors, after unheeded warnings to Russia about the demanding discipline of the markets, the fall of a hedge fund suggests that the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and other regulators nearly missed a potentially big problem at home. 
 Right under the noses of the same people who were dispensing advice to the rest of the world, smack in the middle of the best-supervised, best-capitalized, most open financial markets in the world, a single firm, Long-Term Capital Management L.P., was making bets so big that when they went wrong they threatened to destabilize the whole system.
No one really knows what other problems might arise on Wall Street and ripple through the economy as the global crisis hits the United States with greater force.
"We are less vulnerable than any other nation in the world by a huge margin," said Roger C. Altman, a former Deputy Treasury Secretary. "But we are nonetheless vulnerable.
"None of us knows for sure whether there is another problem in this volatile environment which could rear its ugly head soon, and it might not be a hedge fund but something else," Mr. Altman said.
"Long-Term Capital Management happened to be a hedge fund. But the real point was that its failure was judged to be unacceptable, and that there's so much complexity and leverage in the global financial system that events like this can occur."
The chairman of the House Banking Committee, Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, said today that he would hold hearings in the next week or two to explore the economic and regulatory issues raised by Long-Term Capital Management's troubles.
"Questions exist as to whether appropriate national and international supervision exists and whether funds designed to hedge risk for individual participants create risk to the system as a whole," Mr. Leach said.
In some ways, the regulatory system worked just as it should. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in its role as monitor of the financial markets, caught signals several weeks ago that Long-Term Capital was in trouble. This week it brought together a group of Wall Street powerhouses to assemble a rescue that averted a marketwide problem without calling on taxpayer money.
"This is how the situation should have played out, given our current regime," said Bert Ely, a consultant to the financial services industry. "However, and this is where the average citizen should be concerned, it raises public policy questions about how this got out of control the way it did."
To some extent, the answer lies in the complex nature of the trading done by Long-Term Capital and other investment firms and banks. Not only are some of their trades so complex that they are truly understood by only a relative handful of people, but the strategies employed by Long-Term Capital and other firms are closely guarded secrets.
The hedge fund industry operates largely outside the scope of traditional bank and securities regulators, and relies on money borrowed from a variety of sources, including commercial banks, which to some degree are gambling with federally insured deposits.
George Soros, perhaps the best-known hedge fund operator, described the industry in Congressional testimony this month as "a daisy chain with many intermediaries, and each intermediary has an obligation to his counterparties without knowing who else is involved."
Mr. Soros's appearance before the House Banking Committee on Sept. 15 came more than a week before Long-Term Capital's problems became public.
But his firm was almost certainly aware of the developing difficulties at Long-Term Capital -- Mr. Soros was approached earlier this month about providing financial help -- and his description on Capitol Hill of the brewing problems in the market proved prescient.
After Russia's debt default rocked stock and bond markets around the world last month, "many hedge funds and other speculative accounts sustained large enough losses that they had to be liquidated," he said. "Normal spreads were disrupted, and professionals who arbitrage between various derivatives, that is to say, trade one derivative against another, also sustained large losses."
As a result, he said, banks were "frantically trying to limit their exposure, de-leverage and reduce risk," setting off a shortage of credit that was hurting developing nations and beginning to squeeze the United States.
With hindsight, the brewing problems at Long-Term Capital were no doubt a factor in the increasingly explicit hints from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and William J. McDonough, the president of the New York Fed, that the central bank might soon reduce interest rates. Mr. Greenspan mentioned during Congressional testimony on Wednesday that increasing disruptions to the financial system were one reason why easier monetary policy might soon be justified.
Indeed, having focused for the last year on Asia's problems, policy makers in the United States are well aware of how the bursting of Japan's financial bubble in the early 1990's and the subsequent credit shortage there have stunted the world's second-largest economy. For the last two years, Mr. Greenspan has been making the case that the Fed must be concerned with big swings in financial markets as well as prices as it sets interest rate policy, an approach that seems increasingly justified with each new tremor to hit Wall Street.
Still, Mr. Greenspan has always been reluctant to impose more heavy-handed regulation on complex securities known as derivatives, commonly used by hedge funds in trading strategies. He has argued that banks and other financial institutions are better positioned than auditors or regulators to determine the worth and risk of the securities they hold and finance.
But Mr. Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin have been warning for months about the perils of lenders becoming too sanguine about risk. In the case of Long-Term Capital, it quickly became clear that some of the world's biggest and most sophisticated banks and investment houses had little if any idea what bets were made with the money they lent. And it raised anew the question of whether the regulatory approach to hedge funds is adequate today.
Many hedge funds operate under an exemption in the Investment Company Act of 1940. The exemption was intended to allow family businesses that invest in securities to avoid Federal regulation. The exemption covered pools of money that had fewer than 100 investors and that did not offer shares to the general public.
Funds can also be incorporated offshore and not allow Americans to invest, thus escaping Federal Government jurisdiction. Or hedge funds can operate under a 1996 amendment to the Federal securities laws that exempts from regulation funds limited to fewer than 500 "sophisticated" institutions or individuals -- those that invest more than $25 million or $5 million, respectively.

Fallen Hedge Fund's Bets Are Put at $1.25 Trillion
Long-Term Capital Management made complex bets on international financial markets with a total value drastically higher than previously estimated, financiers who studied its books said yesterday. They said the fund used its $2.2 billion in capital from investors as collateral to buy $125 billion in securities, and then used those securities as collateral to enter into exotic transactions worth $1.25 trillion.
The portfolio had been previously estimated at $90 billion. The size of the fund's portfolio is extraordinary even in the world of hedge funds. How and why Long-Term Capital was able to make such astonishing bets remains unclear. Page A1.
 
The 16 partners of Long-Term Capital still appear to be sitting on gains in their original investments in the hedge fund they managed despite the fund's near-collapse. C3. 

Hopes of a Rate Cut Lift Stocks
Stocks reversed early losses to rally on optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week, which offset concern that banks will report more losses on hedge fund investments. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.78, or three-tenths of 1 percent, to 8,028.77, to end a roller-coaster week that left the average 1.7 percent higher. The Standard & Poor's 500 gained 2.05, or two-tenths of a percent, to 1,044.77. The Nasdaq composite index rose 23.33, or 1.4 percent, to 1,743.67. C3.
 
Treasury prices ended higher, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue to 5.12 percent from 5.16. C3.

Home resales declined last month but remained near a record level, while consumer spending rebounded. Economists said the latest data indicated the impact of Asia's financial crisis on the United States has remained muted so far. C14.

A bill that would give President Clinton enhanced authority to negotiate trade agreements, or "fast track" powers, was defeated by the House of Representatives. A9.
 
Cautious Optimism In Latin America
Outflows of capital appear to be slowing from stock markets in Latin America, and Wall Street analysts attribute the change to signs that world lenders are preparing to rescue Brazil from a potential financial collapse. But the cautious optimism could evaporate if Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, loses the election an Oct. 4 or reneges on promises of fiscal austerity in Latin America's most important economy. C2.
 
NASA Contract for Lockheed
Lockheed Martin said it had won a $3.44 billion, 10-year contract to run NASA's space operations, beating out Boeing. Lockheed's initial contract is valued at $1.9 billion over five years, with options for another five years totaling $1.54 billion. C3.

Russia's new Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, is preparing to reassert state control over key parts of the vodka industry, terminated when President Boris N.

The change, if it is successful, would re-establish something akin to the vodka industry of the old Soviet days and provide the state with a badly needed source of income. A4.

HEADLINE: In the Dominican Republic, Widespread Desolation After the Storm

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, Sept. 25

 BODY:
The official death toll from Hurricane Georges in the Dominican Republic rose to more than 210 today. At least 800 other people were missing and feared dead, largely in hard-hit provinces east of the capital here, while rescue workers struggled to reach villages isolated by floods and mudslides.
With food and water stocks running perilously low, relief teams from the United States and France joined Dominican officials in trying to feed the hungry and thirsty survivors of the hurricane, which destroyed 90 percent of the nation's crops as it cut a deadly path through the island of Hispaniola on Tuesday. 
 At least half the houses in the eastern provinces were said to have been destroyed or severely damaged by the storm, with more than 300,000 people forced out of their homes and into public shelters.
A state of emergency already in place, President Leonel Fernandez appealed for international assistance and warned the more than eight million people in his country's that it might be six weeks before electrical power could be restored.
"In a word, the picture is one of desolation," Mr. Fernandez said after visiting devastated areas. The President calculated damage to the nation's electrical system alone at more than $100 million
Tourist resorts like Casa de Campo were also badly hit, Government officials said, as were the nation's three principal airports on the southern coast, including Las Americas International Airport, outside Santo Domingo.
"The problem there is not the tarmac, but the terminal" and control tower, both of which were heavily damaged, Bernardo Vega, the Dominican Ambassador to the United States, said this afternoon.
Villages north of of Santo Domingo became islands surrounded by miles of muddy water, and victims frantically waved as rescue aircraft flew overhead.
Eight hundred people swarmed around a Dominican Air Force helicopter when it tried to land today on an island in the town of Matamomon. Its three-man crew kicked off desperate people trying to climb aboard, and tossed food rations to those screaming on the ground below.
Food and water stocks ran perilously low after the hurricane struck here on Tuesday night with winds of 110 miles per hour.
"In the shelters people are hungry, thirsty and in bad conditions sanitary-wise," said Rodger Garner, a program officer for the United States Agency for International Development. "The food stocks will be used up pretty quickly."
A United States Air Force C-130 cargo plane landed in Santo Domingo with enough plastic tarpaulins to roof 2,000 houses. Sixty-three search-and-rescue firefighters from New York were being flown in, while a French C-130 also delivered disaster specialists, food and medical aid.
Paul Bell, regional disaster relief director for the Agency for International Development, said it was the first of an extensive airlift of food and other aid. Mr. Bell warned that people sick with water-borne diseases like dengue fever "will overload the hospital system, which was never very good anyway."
Hispaniola is an impoverished island of 15 million people shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and its substandard housing could not stand up to the winds and flooding, the primary cause of most deaths.
In Santo Domingo, shelters opened only as the storm was about to hit. In Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, denuded mountains and unmaintained drainage systems were blamed for widespread floods.
At least 87 bodies have been recovered in Haiti, but the authorities there fear that the death toll could grow as they moved into poverty-stricken rural areas where the concept of civil defense does not exist and people live in flimsy shacks made of wood or cardboard.
Most of Haiti's hillsides have been deforested by people in need of fuel, which increases the possibility of mudslides and inundations. In the wake of the storm, there were also fears that epidemics of cholera and typhoid could break out and that swollen rivers could overflow their banks and deluge the fertile Artibonite Valley, which grows much of Haiti's food.
Twenty miles north of the Santo Domingo, treetops, stripped of foliage, poked above the brown, muddy water. At some points the flooding was miles wide.
Outside the capital, gun-toting guards and several hundred inmates stood on the roof of the pentagon-shaped La Victoria prison, most of which was underwater.
Throughout Santo Domingo, thousands of people stood in long lines for water, and many filled their jugs from the debris-filled Ozama River.
"There's no water, there's no power," said Domingo Osvaldo Fortuna, 51, as he filled a jug with river water. "There is nothing."

HEADLINE: Postings: Skyscraper Museum's New Exhibit, at 16 Wall Street;
'Building the Empire State'

 BODY:
With one exception (a certain tall structure at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street), there would seem to be no better place for the Skyscraper Museum to hold a show on the Empire State Building than in the former banking hall at 16 Wall Street, which was designed by the same architects, Shreve, Lamb & Harmon.
Opening Thursday, the show will use photos, schedules and a job diary to document the extraordinarily swift construction of the 1,252-foot Empire State Building, from April 7, 1930, to March 1, 1931 -- less time than it would take today to prepare an environmental impact statement on the project. 
 The world's tallest building was a tough act to follow. And Shreve, Lamb & Harmon did not exactly outdo themselves a year later with 16 Wall Street, a 25-story annex to the Bankers Trust Building.
But they did create a grandly modernist banking hall: a forest of squared-off, trunk-like columns clad in Oregon myrtle, as rich in color as roasted coffee beans. The T-shaped, 10,000-square-foot room extends to Pine Street. The woodwork resembles fine cabinetry and the columns soar 27 feet to a coved ceiling.
"I'm very pleased to be there and a bit intimidated," said Carol Willis, the founder, director and curator of the museum. The two-year-old organization has no permanent home and must borrow its exhibition space -- in this case, from the Chase Manhattan Bank, which moved out of 16 Wall Street in July.
Chase has donated the banking hall for use by the Skyscraper Museum through March 1999. The bank's lease runs through the end of 2004 and it is now looking for a subtenant. "Ideally, we would market it intact to a financial service-type user," said James Walker, an assistant vice president at Chase.
Both the pyramid-topped original Bankers Trust Building, 14 Wall Street, and its annex are landmarks. The designation does not cover the interior.
The show will be open Tuesdays through Saturdays, 12 to 6 P.M. Admission will be free in October, with a $2 suggested donation thereafter.
As a companion piece, W. W. Norton & Company has published "Building the Empire State," edited by Ms. Willis, which reproduces a fastidiously detailed 77-page scrapbook kept by the contractor, Starrett Brothers & Eken. The scrapbook came from the files of Starrett's corporate successor, H R H Construction.
The typewritten log is filled with marvelous arcana: the 250,000 square feet of terrazzo floors required 45 tons of brass for expansion joints and 15,000 bags of marble chips from Italy (Botticino), Belgium (Belgian black) and Maryland (Cardiff green).
But it also concerns itself with serious controversies, such as rumors and press reports implying that "adequate protection of human life was entirely disregarded in the feverish anxiety of all concerned in the project to establish a record for speed."
While denying the charge, the anonymous author noted that seven people lost their lives: three carpenters, two laborers, an ironworker and a pedestrian, Elizabeth Eagher, who died of blood poisoning after her ankle was fractured by a falling plank in July 1930.
The scrapbook ends wondering how long the tower will stand. "Perhaps it will live on to see old Empires crumble," it concludes. "Or, perhaps, the rapidly changing economic conditions of a new era will precipitate its destruction sooner than we care to anticipate."

One Lawmaker's Ideas on Peeling Away Layers of Redundant Services

BYLINE: By RICHARD TRENNER

 BODY:
In her quest for consolidation of municipal services, Governor Whitman may find an unexpected ally in a prominent Democrat who once sought his party's nomination for governor.
Alan J. Karcher, a former speaker of the New Jersey Assembly who is an ardent advocate of municipal consolidation, believes "the costs of maintaining New Jersey's multiple and redundant jurisdictions mount into the billions of dollars." 
 Mr. Karcher, a 55-year-old Princeton resident who represented Middlesex County in the Legislature for 17 years before retiring in 1990, has just completed a book, "New Jersey's Multiple Municipal Madness," (Rutgers University Press, 1998) in which he proposes that many of the state's 566 municipalities be shown the door.
Marc Mappen, a historian at Rutgers University and co-editor of the forthcoming Encyclopedia of New Jersey, summarizes Mr. Karcher's message this way: "We have a big problem in our state. It hits you in the wallet by producing high property taxes and bureaucratic inefficiency. It lurks behind the godawful suburban sprawl that destroys the environment and plagues your commute to work with traffic jams, and it is why our cities are dying. The problem is balkanization."
Clearing away the layers of fiefdoms, Mr. Karcher writes, would not only help Mrs. Whitman achieve her goal of lower property taxes, but also alleviate problems in several other important areas ranging from the state's public education system, which he calls "an abysmal failure," to post-1950 development characterized by "tawdry strip malls, ticky-tacky suburban subdivisions, and abandoned factories surrounded by battle-scarred ghettos."
Put another way -- or as Mr. Mappen observes, with "cynicism, sarcasm and humor," -- Mr. Karcher likens the state's jurisdictional outlines to "a web woven by a spider on LSD."
A key theme of Mr. Karcher is that the motives for creating so many municipalities, largely in the 19th century, were usually "petty, personal" and, by today's standards, politically incorrect.
To drive this home, Mr. Karcher does a good deal of storytelling about town origins. He recounts, for example, how the Borough of Florham Park, in Morris County, instantly became the richest town with the lowest tax rate in the United States when, in 1899, it was split off from Chatham Township for the benefit of two wealthy landowners. Their aim was to reduce the taxes on the roughly seven square miles that their estates jointly occupied.
About 85 years earlier, New Jersey's first borough -- Princeton Borough -- was created, Mr. Karcher writes, "for easier control of alcohol consumption and repression of African-Americans." Indeed, he sees the creation of local jurisdictions as having been, until the advent of zoning in the 1920's, a popular tool for segregating people along economic, class and racial lines.
A related theme is that whatever the original motives behind New Jersey's "multiple municipal madness," they are largely irrelevant today. "When are we going to acknowledge," he writes, "that we have too long tolerated a municipal framework that represents the opposite of everything this century has learned about effective management, efficient control, economy of scale?"
Although Mr. Karcher says that the basic purpose of his book is to diagnose problems rather than to prescribe remedies, he does make clear his belief that consolidation -- presumably the chief antidote to balkanization -- offers many benefits. He also presents various consolidation scenarios.
He recently estimated that $3 billion to $5 billion could be saved each year by eliminating many smaller municipal redundancies in the areas of education, public safety, and similar services. He also suggests that with consolidation, the "ratables chase," a leading cause of urban decay and suburban sprawl, would become much less seductive to many towns.
The urban-suburban tug-of-war and land use patterns have long concerned Mr. Karcher, according to Karen Jezierny, an assistant dean at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and an aide to Mr. Karcher in the Assembly. "He has been a visionary" in terms of regional planning and the need to counter the further division of New Jersey into prosperous suburbs and poor cities, Ms. Jezierny said.
In terms of consolidation scenarios, Mr. Karcher describes two basic types: voluntary and mandatory. The voluntary approach relies on incentives provided by the state to encourage consolidation of municipal services and boundaries.
While he recently commented that Mrs. Whitman has "probably spoken more and done more on this issue than any other governor since the Depression," he called her voluntary approach to consolidation "timid." The state "should create a whole spectrum of incentives" and in fact it "has the power to effectuate the greatest possible incentive of all: a uniform property tax rate."
Believing that the state's constitution renders home rule "a delusion," Mr. Karcher writes that the state "could begin to force consolidations, even without incentives for municipalities." Using a mandatory approach, consolidation could, he says, be phased in over several years, with the aim of halving the number of jurisdictions.
Mr. Karcher's book will not appear until November, but word of it has already begun to generate comment. Henry A. Coleman, the director of the Center for Government Services at Rutgers, and his predecessor, Ernest C. Reock Jr., said recently that they agreed with some of Mr. Karcher points but disagree with others.
Mr. Coleman said that while New Jersey has many more local jurisdictions than one would probably expect in such a small state, economists are still debating whether the number of jurisdictions is superfluous.
"People tend to believe that having a high number of jurisdictions leads to excessive local spending," Mr. Coleman said. "But we don't really know the optimal size for a local unit of government in order for it to be efficient or to generate the right degree of competition with other units."
While agreeing that some jurisdictions came about "for class and racial reasons," Mr. Coleman is skeptical about Mr. Karcher's emphasis on the "ratable chase" as a problem unique to having a large number of municipalities. If jurisdictions have access to only one main source of revenue, property taxes, the ratable chase will be a problem, Mr. Coleman said, "no matter how many jurisdictions there are."
Mr. Reock commented that data do not support Mr. Karcher's estimate of savings in the billions, even from massive consolidation. And both critics questioned the political feasibility of bringing about widespread consolidation.
Anticipating criticism, Mr. Karcher said he takes comfort in his sense that the main purpose of his book is to inspire debate about a problem with deep historical roots and serious ramifications yet is recognized by few New Jerseyans.

Moody's Raises Ratings On Some State Bonds

BYLINE: By KIRSTY SUCATO

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service has upgraded ratings for New Jersey's $7.45 billion appropriation debt, bonds that must be reauthorized by the Legislature each year, saying a strong economy and a reliance on the bonds for important capital projects make the state less likely to default, state officials announced last week.
The upgrades, on bonds issued by several state authorities, each came in one-notch increments. For example, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority's $456 million debt rose from an Aa to an Aa3 rating, while New Jersey Transit Corporation's $348 million bond issue moved from Aa3 to Aa2, three steps below the highest rating of Aaa. 
 Higher ratings mean the state will probably pay lower interest rates on future bond issues, said James M. Petrino, the assistant director of public finance in the State Department of the Treasury.
The rating for New Jersey's $3.57 general obligation debt, bonds authorized by voters, remained unchanged at Aa1, but Moody's revised its outlook from negative to stable. KIRSTY SUCATO

Full-Time Mothers Meet Part-Time Jobs

BYLINE: By JULIA LAWLOR 

 BODY:
ON a typical school day in Mill Valley, Calif., Paula Reynolds rises at 5:30 A.M., gets her two oldest children out the door by 7:45 and hops into the car to follow her youngest as he navigates his bike down the hill to school. Then she commutes to work to San Francisco, 45 minutes away. Five hectic hours later, she heads back home in time to greet her children -- Peter, 12; Julia, 9, and Charlie, 6 -- at the door at 3 P.M.
"My kids are at an age where they want to be with me more than anybody else," said Ms. Reynolds, 43, the co-owner of a firm that supplies temporary executives to corporations. So she works a 26-hour week, guaranteeing that she will have some afternoon hours with her children. "I'll have plenty of time later to develop my career," she said. 
 Ms. Reynolds has resolved to her satisfaction the great quandary of the working Mom -- how to balance the demands of her job with the tugging at her heart. But the conundrum stymies millions of women, and not a few men, anew each fall as the school year begins.The job -- and the desire to advance -- beckon. But who will greet young children at the end of the day? Older children might be able to fend for themselves, but shouldn't somebody be there prodding them to do their homework or driving them to soccer practice?
For most women, quitting their jobs is not an option; they simply cannot afford the loss of income. Many of those part-time positions being advertised in the newspaper -- as bank tellers, school aides or store clerks -- pay pittances. And despite all the talk at corporations these days about family-friendly workplaces, asking the boss for a reduced work schedule often gets a frosty reception.
Ms. Reynolds found that out in 1986, when she asked her manager in the sales division of the AT&T Corporation if she could cut back on her hours to spend more time with her infant son. The answer was no. So she quit and founded her company, M Squared, with another mother.
But for the vast majority of working women, who don't own businesses, the task can be much trickier.
More people than ever want to escape the confines of the traditional workweek. In a survey of 2,877 employees last year by the Families and Work Institute, based in New York, 63 percent said they would like to reduce the number of hours they worked, up from 47 percent in 1992. Seventy percent of working parents say they did not have enough time to spend with their children.
But the study also showed that many workers felt that it would be difficult to move to shorter hours. Only 38 percent of full-timers said "yes" or "maybe" when asked if they could arrange a part-time schedule, while 58 percent of part-timers gave those answers when asked if they could switch to full-time.
 PART-TIME work is especially rare among managers. A survey of 2,000 managers and professionals in four companies last year by Catalyst, a New York firm that consults with businesses on women's issues, found that just 11 percent of the women and 4 percent of the men worked part-time, compared with 21 percent and 8 percent, respectively, for all working women and men.
Although more than 60 percent of large employers offer part-time work, according to Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm, there are very few takers among the full-time staff, and for good reason. Part-time work, of course, generally comes with no health insurance, paid vacations, sick days or other benefits.
And many managers believe it is difficult to manage a staff that has varying part-time schedules. "People don't widely use these policies because there's a general sense that they don't work," said Marcia Brumit Kropf, a vice president at Catalyst.
Many corporate cultures continue to put more value on "face time," or the number of hours a worker stays in the office, than on the work product. And workers who switch to part-time schedules risk being viewed as less committed to their work.
There are also days when part-timers feel inadequate both at work and home and wonder if all the juggling is worth it. "Sometimes, I feel like I have the best of all worlds; sometimes I feel like I'm not doing anything well," Ms. Reynolds said. Her dual responsibilities have so crowded her life that her colleagues once bought her a "Where's Waldo?" book for Christmas, pasted a little picture of Ms. Reynolds over Waldo's face, and retitled it "Where's Paula?"
Linda Lindmeier, 42, a lab technician who has held a series of temporary jobs for nine years through Manpower, the temporary help company, thinks she would have been promoted to a management position by now had she stayed with one employer. But Ms. Lindmeier, of Wadsworth, Ill., has always wanted to work a 7 A.M.-to-3:30 P.M. shift and have summers off with her children, now 15 and 13.
"I grew up in a small town on a lake where we'd spend all summer hanging out," she said. "I wanted my kids to have summers off like I did, and not to be in day care 12 months a year."
True, she sometimes feels a pang of jealousy about her husband's paycheck, which equaled hers when the couple was childless but is now four times hers. Still, she cannot imagine giving up summers of swimming and bike-riding.
"I've gotten so darned used to this," she said, "I don't think I'll ever go back to full-time."

Can a Generation Learn to Share?

BYLINE: By James Schembari; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years will appear the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to
jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
ON graduation day, during that walk to the auditorium to return our caps and gowns, giddy about the future, were we ever so confident as to imagine that we'd be where we are now? That we'd have lucrative jobs, full retirement accounts and nice homes soaring in value?
An American living in Geneva told me last summer, after I marveled about his city, that, yes, it was lovely, but that "I wish we had your economy." A few days later, a Paris businessman told me the same thing. 
 America's baby boomers are indeed fortunate. But what are we doing with our good fortune? What good have we done? There are moral issues involved in such plenty, and there is evidence that we are not responding as we could. How do we measure up, say, to our parents' generation when it comes to philanthropy?
"You Americans are very generous," my friend in Paris said, "but you are so . . . " He stopped, not knowing the English word. He spoke in French to another person at the table, who then turned to me and said, "clumsy."
Still probably not the right word, but the image of falling down was clear.
It is estimated that since the bull market began, stocks have created about $8 trillion of wealth. Money is now the national sport. We chat about our investments, show off our new kitchens, our Range Rovers. Even as the market sputters, there seems to be no limit to what we can have or do.
"It is the first time in history that the phrase 'we can't afford it,' cannot honestly be used to determine choices of consumption in a family," said Paul G. Schervish, director of the Social Welfare Research Institute at Boston College. "Affluence opens up the opportunity for charitable giving. But it also opens up the opportunity to buy a second home and then say, 'I don't have enough for charity.' "
So while no one says boomers lack hearts, there is concern that they are not approaching philanthropy with the same passion as consumption.
One measure of philanthropy is the percentage of personal income given to charity. In the mid-1960's, when many boomers' parents were in their 40's, it was 2.2 percent. Now it is 1.9 percent. And surveys show that giving by high-income people is not increasing as quickly as wealth.
But even if the boomers are close to their parents in giving, close somehow seems so inadequate in the midst of so much wealth.
"The baby boomers' parents were happy with a two-bedroom cottage and one-car garage," said Sara Melendez, president of Independent Sector, an association of nonprofit groups. "Now it's, 'How many TV sets do we have?'
"Baby boomers are at the peak of their earnings," she added, "and certainly when you are making more than you ever have before, that is the time to give more."
That sounds like our parents, prodding us to finish the food on our plates. "There are children starving in China," my mother would say. Of course, now there are schools that have been forced to hold classes in bathrooms. And that's in New York.
It's hard not to see the point. I've always warded off guilt with the feeling that I've been generous. I write checks to charity, and I volunteer at my church. But I took a harder look when I began researching this column. I do volunteer work for six hours a month, every other month. That's less than an hour a week. Those checks I write come out to 2.4 percent of my income, above the national average but still below what I know I can afford.
Why? I share the fears of many other people about the future: How will I ever have enough for my children's college education? My retirement?
But I've never asked the questions from the heart: Do I really need my three cars? Did I really need to renovate the bathroom? Should I have gone to the Poconos instead of to Paris this summer?
 VIRGINIA HODGKINSON, a research professor of public policy at Georgetown University, says that until the pressures of college and retirement are relieved, boomers probably will not increase their giving. But history suggests that they will change someday.
The most generous givers tend to be 65 to 74 years old, donating almost 4 percent of their incomes. So charities have their fingers crossed, hoping that the boomers, blessed with so much, will eventually arrive on the other side of their economic worries and do one great thing.
"The first wave of the baby boom has the capacity to engage in philanthropy like no previous generation," Dr. Hodgkinson said. That will happen, she said, when they realize how much has piled up in their 401(k)'s. "That's the moment when we need to ask this generation about their obligation to future generations."

In Paris, a Wall Street Veteran Argues the Case for Laissez-Faire

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
FRANCE has been governed by the Socialists for the entire year that Felix G. Rohatyn has been the United States Ambassador in Paris. So Mr. Rohatyn, the former Lazard Freres partner who oversaw the rescue of New York City from the brink of bankruptcy in the 1970's, has spent a lot of time trying to explain American "popular capitalism" to the French.
"What I mean is a highly advanced market system in a democratic country, with large participation by the population in the ownership of capital assets, coupled with an active and intelligent Government that provides an advanced social safety net and sophisticated regulatory systems, in a law-abiding culture," Mr. Rohatyn said. 
 "The idea that we have casino capitalism in the States, and no social protection, is very widespread here. It has negative effects not only on us but in terms of policies that might help the French economy."
This is a man who spent most of his adult life on Wall Street, and who knows that up is not the only direction markets can move. Back in July, he told a French audience that "someday, markets are likely to turn down, and popular capitalism will encounter some difficult moments."
"Well, here we are," he laughed the other day in the Ambassador's residence, a palace with a back garden as big as President Jacques Chirac's just down the street.
Mr. Rohatyn and his wife, Elizabeth, prefer quiet dinners incognito at unpretentious bistros like Quincy, near the Gare de Lyon, or Chez Tante Louise, near the residence, to black-tie functions in official surroundings.
"I've never lost the feeling that somehow I don't belong, or that if I belong it's only because of the intervention of fate," he reflected, as if at 70 he could somehow still be blacklisted by French society.
His life has taught him respect for adversity. He acquired his perfect French as a boy at the Lycee Janson-de-Sailly in Paris from 1937 to 1940, after his family, all Polish Jews, came here from Vienna to get away from the Nazis. They fled again in May 1940, when the Germans invaded France.
"Our driver tried to take my mother, her mother-in-law, our old Polish cook and me across the border into Spain, but all the roads were closed," he recalled. "We decided we'd at least be better off in the part of France that wasn't occupied by the Germans. When we turned a corner in the woods we came to a German checkpoint, and it didn't take much imagination to see what was probably going to happen."
Fate did intervene. "The German turned and lit up a cigarette after waving through the car in front of us. My mother held her driver's license up at the window, and he let us through without checking our papers. I was 12 at the time. A year later they were deporting people, including children, to Auschwitz from occupied France."
The family eventually made its way to Casablanca and from there, by boat, to the United States, where Mr. Rohatyn would later go into finance and find success.
But it is only recently that Mr. Rohatyn has felt able to revisit the happier moments of his own past here and seek out a few former classmates from his old school.
Now, as he looks at the world, he sees Washington preoccupied with scandal and economies in grave trouble in Russia, Asia and elsewhere. "I believe President Clinton's call for a conference of foreign ministers to review the current state of the financial system is a welcome response to current concerns," he said, adding that it "will offset the eroding confidence which is beginning to paralyze the world."
Mr. Rohatyn now acknowledges that "popular capitalism" might not be the right answer for every country at every stage of development, and he thinks European countries will probably always prefer a wider social safety net than Americans do. But he tells visiting Americans to look at steps that the Socialist Prime Minister of France, Lionel Jospin, has taken toward privatization of state-owned aviation, military and banking companies.
The French and American business communities could learn a lot more from each other if they had a forum for exchanging ideas, he said, so he has started the French-American Business Council.
Over the years, Mr. Rohatyn's activities gave him hundreds of close contacts in French business and financial circles. "I first met a lot of these guys in the early 1980's, when France was nationalizing companies and imposing credit controls," he said. "There's been incredible change since.
"France is one of the major foreign investors in the United States, with almost 350,000 Americans working for French companies, and similar numbers for American investment in France," Mr. Rohatyn explained. "Companies like Compagnie de Saint-Gobain in glass and Danone in food products have a big presence in the States. Here, you have companies like I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola -- but there was no forum for them to dialogue with each other.
"I started talking last fall to a few people on both sides -- Dana Mead, chairman of Tenneco; George David at United Technologies, Jean-Louis Beffa at Saint-Gobain, Antoine Riboud at Danone, and others. And last June, when Mr. Jospin went to Washington on a working visit, he and President Clinton attended the first meeting of the council in the Executive Office Building, with about 50 C.E.O.'s in attendance."
On that occasion, Mr. Jospin said he and others in France had underestimated the ability of the low-tax, free-market American economy to produce hundreds of thousands of permanent, high-paying jobs -- instead of just the low-paying, fast-food jobs that so many intellectuals here had derided whenever anyone suggested that France should follow America's lead. Crushing welfare-state tax burdens and labor regulations are often blamed for France's failure to reduce unemployment, which is at 11.8 percent even after years of economic expansion.
Mr. Rohatyn, whose business background often makes him chafe at governmental inertia, looks for ways in which an ambassador can make a difference. His latest tilt at the bureaucratic windmills is an effort to increase the official American presence in the French regions outside the capital, where most American assets are today. His plan calls for setting up simple "American presence posts," a sort of miniature consulate with a staff of two or three people. The first is expected to open shortly in Lyons; Mr. Rohatyn hopes to add others in Lille, Toulouse, Bordeaux and Rennes.
That would be satisfying, but not quite like arranging a billion-dollar leveraged buyout. "I don't yearn to be back making deals, but what I used to do always had a beginning, a middle and an end," he said. "This is more like a continuum. It's never clear when you've actually accomplished something."

HEADLINE: The Tourist Trap;
With All Those Visitors Trampling the Welcome Mat, Can New York Be the Host With the Most for Everyone?

BYLINE: By DAVID KIRBY

 BODY:
WOULDN'T you know it? Now that New York's reputation is all bright and shiny, everyone wants to drop by. Last year, a record 33 million visitors did just that. But not everyone has the welcome mat out.
Tourism has been very, very good to New York. Visitors spent a whopping $13.7 billion last year, paid $710 million in taxes and generated thousands of jobs, as the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau is eager to point out. But many New Yorkers have grown weary of all the out-of-towners, who are showing up pretty much all year round. Some wonder if there are better ways to manage tourism that reap its benefits without sacrificing too much of the city's heart and soul. 
 Mayor Giuliani likes to trumpet quality-of-life improvements as one reason for the boost in tourism. But for many who live and work in New York, the camera-toting masses create quality-of-life problems of their own. It's not just the crowded sidewalks, the traffic jams, the tour buses belching smoke and the long lines for museums, movies and theater tickets. For some people, there's also the sense that they are living in a fishbowl.
Take SoHo. As City Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed sees it, the neighborhood has become "like a giant amusement park, except the people who live here aren't amused -- and the tourists don't even throw us peanuts."
Carol Friedman, an artist who lives in the neighborhood, endures double-decker buses regularly rumbling by the window of her second-floor studio, and guides with bullhorns who promise glimpses "of a real SoHo artist, if you look close!" She often keeps her blinds drawn. "When I don't," she says, "they photograph and videotape right into my space, often even pointing at me as if I'm an animal in a zoo; it's a continual disruption."
Some New Yorkers have gone so far as to stay home on weekends in an effort to avoid tourists, said Julian Vigo, a cultural studies theorist who is an adjunct faculty member at the Gallatin School of Individualized Studies at New York University. "That's sad," she said, "because we're in a city where we pay so much rent to live in such small spaces and the only thing we have is the streets, and now they belong to other people, at least in places like the Village. And what could be weirder than New Yorkers who don't want to go out?"
Gina Luria Walker, chairwoman of the social sciences department at the New School, agrees that the boom in tourism has changed the way many New Yorkers experience their city. "I think we see the city, despite the good economic reasons, transforming itself into a place that's not so different from other places," she said. "And that is for, and because of, tourism."
Though most New Yorkers would not consider themselves xenophobic, she said, "I think we mourn for the little stores that didn't have name recognition, and wandering through neighborhoods where you just happened on something that reflected yourself back at you in a way that the Gap and Disney and hordes of people who are clearly out-of-towners never could. They just dispel that magic."
"People are mourning the malling of Manhattan, and tourism has a lot to do with it," Dr. Walker added. "Some people say, 'We wish tourists would just send the money and not come.' On the other hand, this is a great, cosmopolitan city. And it's these very tensions that keep it so vibrant."
Even among ardent boosters of tourism, there's a growing consensus that tourism requires better planning. "We're beginning to see people saying, 'We want it done responsibly,' " said Lalia Rach, dean of the Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Travel Administration at New York University. "They want to address these things, because if tourism doesn't solve these problems, it will destroy itself."
 
'We're New York City, Not Charlotte, N.C.'
Fran Reiter, president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau and a former deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration, has heard just about every complaint in the book about tourists. "There are quality-of-life issues, balancing issues, waterfront issues, price pressures," she said. "And it is crowded. There are times when it's difficult to get down the street."
"If you stop a New Yorker on the street and you say, 'What do you think about these tourists?' they will immediately start complaining," Ms. Reiter said. "And I put myself in that category." So the tireless tourism promoter herself grumbles about the crowds? "Absolutely," she said. "I can complain with the best of them. But I keep it to myself and don't allow it to influence how we deal with these issues."
"We're New York City, not Charlotte, N.C., and there are certain things that come with living in New York," Ms. Reiter added. "There are fabulous things and not-so-fabulous things, and we need to protect the fabulous and deal with the problems."
While there have been no definitive studies to determine where tourism ranks in terms of its overall contribution to New York's economy, Ms. Reiter said, "tourism is one of the fastest-growing, most-important sectors." She says the Visitors Bureau expects to see an increase in tourism-related employment when it gets new figures soon. In 1995, 4.5 percent of the city's private-sector employment -- a total of 131,000 jobs -- was directly linked to tourism.
Still, finance, insurance and real estate provide the most jobs in the private sector, followed by the health care industry. "But our economy is too dependent" on the three big industries, Ms. Reiter said. "The stock market is out of whack, which disproportionately impacts the city, because it's so important. We need stabilizing industries that aren't as subject to those kinds of fluctuations. Tourism can provide that."
Ms. Reiter's enthusiasm is shared by many in New York, including Mayor Giuliani, who declined to be interviewed. They say mass tourism is far preferable to the days, not so long ago, when the city was widely viewed as unsafe.
"The impact is huge and beneficial in every way, direct and indirect," said H. Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association. "As for overcrowding, well, what a magnificent problem to have," he said. "Especially compared with when the city was down on itself. If the flip side is a hollowed out city, I'll take tourism."
But as Dr. Rach of N.Y.U. pointed out, tourism can become a victim of its own success. "You can lose your cachet," she said. "Maintaining status is a real problem for any destination. Just look at Cancun."
Travel is a fragile industry, subject to that perfect paradox from New York's own Yogi Berra: "It's so crowded there, nobody goes anymore." And overcrowding is epidemic in some areas of Manhattan, like Times Square, SoHo, Greenwich Village and parts of Fifth Avenue, where huge numbers of tourists wander, some seemingly oblivious to the living, breathing city around them. A recent study by the Times Square Business Improvement District found 7,083 pedestrians per hour on a corner of Seventh Avenue and 44th Street on a Wednesday, matinee day for Broadway theaters. "That's about double what it was a few years ago," said the district's director of community development, Suany Chough.
Denise Saunder, who works at a bank near Times Square, said the throngs of tourists sometimes kept her from going out during the day. "Some days I don't leave for lunch because it would take too long to get a sandwich," she said. "It's really not fair. We got to eat, too."
Ms. Vigo, who studies the relationships between private and public space, said she believed "the tourist crowds have become a serious quality-of-life issue." On Fifth Avenue and 10th Street on a recent Saturday, she said, "the tourists were stopping at street vendors, forming huge, impassable groups with no conception they were blocking foot traffic."
"I'm always amazed how they have no concept of the value of personal space in New York," Ms. Vigo said. "New Yorkers have this intuitive sense of space and boundaries, and tourism is all about being in someone else's space."
It's no wonder, she says, that residents become irritated when out-of-towners gawk at them as if they were exotic creatures, or, even worse, take their pictures without permission. Ms. Vigo recalled a scene in Greenwich Village when a tour bus passed through. When the guide "started talking about being in the 'gay area,' " she said, a man who was at a pay phone on the street "ran up to the bus waving and yelling: 'Yes! Hello! I'm gay, that's right, look at me!' "
 
Whose Neighborhood Is It? Troubles Over Turf
In some neighborhoods there is resentment when tourists come to look around but spend little or no money. Harlem, for example, has long attracted busloads of Europeans and Asians, who pack neighborhood churches for free gospel shows and often hurry back to their coaches before spending a dime uptown. "They pay up to $75 each to get bused up there," said Ester R. Fuchs, director of the Barnard-Columbia Center for Urban Policy. "Many tours have lunch in midtown before going to hear gospel music at a church, which they could do for free. And there's little spending in the neighborhood. Put in context, the local people are getting nothing."
The question for community leaders, she said, is how to "capture tourists' dollars without turning Harlem into a circus sideshow with nothing in it for the community."
Deborah Mitchell, director of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, said it's hard to get tourists to spend money there "when there's no organized effort to get people into local restaurants, or have goods to sell, like caps and T-shirts that say 'Harlem.' But, she added, "with some targeted investment we can turn that around."
In other neighborhoods, there is concern that tourism is pushing out longtime residents and businesses and leading to an increase in prices for basic commodities. In Clinton, for example, community leaders say delis and convenience stores along Eighth and Ninth Avenues have been charging more for food, a problem for residents in an area with only one big supermarket.
"People living near Times Square in Hell's Kitchen are not particularly wealthy, but food prices have become dramatically higher than what's charged in other areas," said City Councilman Thomas K. Duane, who represents the area. "The old mom and pop stores are being pushed out, and the new stores set prices at levels that tourists can pay. In some delis, especially near hotels, they charge $1.50 for a can of soda."
Bob Kalin, a tenant organizer for Housing Conservation Coordinators, a nonprofit group, said S.R.O.'s were increasingly converted into low-budget tourist hotels. At the Aladdin, at 317 West 45th Street, only 40 of the 110 permanent tenants remain, he said, with the rest of the rooms used for tourists. "We're depleting S.R.O.'s for genuinely poor people who've lived here a long time," he said. "Hundreds of units have been lost and hundreds more are threatened."
In SoHo, many residents worry about tourism driving out the artists who put the neighborhood on the map. "We're killing the goose that laid the golden egg," Ms. Freed said. "How are they supposed to work in this atmosphere? At night, people stagger down the block singing bad French songs. In the day, some idiot plays bagpipes. That's only for tourists."
Sean Sweeney, executive director of the SoHo Alliance, a community group, estimated that crowds and traffic doubled annually. "I don't shop on weekends, except maybe for milk and bread," he said. "I thought I was a kook. But apparently everybody does that." Mr. Sweeney said he knew 15 artists who had moved away in recent years.
While some New Yorkers see tourists as invading their home turf, to others the millions of visitors are competitors for urban amenities. What good are those world-class museums, theaters and shopping areas and all those taxis, many residents wonder, if the lines are around the block, the stores are mobbed and all the cabs are full?
Sixty-one percent of the tourists last year came for leisure, the Visitors Bureau said. And while 12.3 million people came on business, some of them find tourism has put a crimp in their plans. "In summer, we have to plan travel around the availability of rooms," said Bill Schneider, the CNN political analyst. "Sometimes there just aren't any. And believe me, CNN travel agents have connections. But New York has gotten so inconvenient. It's so hard to get a room that I don't go there as much as I would."
 
No Room at the Inn, No Room on the Bridge
Dr. Rach of N.Y.U. said that in the tourist gold rush climate, "providing services to traditional clients is not what it used to be." Some hotels, she said, are not nurturing long-term relationships with faithful customers. "Leisure travelers are beating down their doors," she said. "In the short term, there's lots and lots of money. But in the long term, how well are they taking care of their investment?"
"What goes around comes around," she said. And when there's a downturn, "all those rooms will become available, and those clients will have their revenge."
Ms. Reiter said: "It's a problem, of course. So how do we address it? Do we tell people, 'Don't come here on visits?' Hell, no. I'm not going to tell anybody not to come. We need more hotels; we need more conference space. We don't have the infrastructure in place to support the level of business we could have."
Is New York on its way to full capacity? Aside from hotel room occupancy, which Ms. Reiter said often approached 100 percent, though 5,000 more rooms were expected by the year 2000, no one seemed to know.
"I haven't seen any studies on capacities for cars and people," said Rae Zimmerman, director of the Institute for Civil Infrastructure Systems at the Urban Planning Program of New York University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. "But I know we don't provide enough public bathrooms for everyone."
Richard Barth, director of the Manhattan office of the city's Department of City Planning, said, "All growth factors are taken into account when planning services, and that absolutely includes visitors." He said his agency was working with the Department of Transportation to study pedestrian and traffic flow in heavily traveled areas and looking at ways to improve the situation.
Dr. Rach said: "When looking at any destination, whether it's quality of life, the number of beds or the public infrastructure, there's a carrying capacity that must be determined. But we have this megalopolis where it's not apparent that you even have a carrying capacity, and it's not till you build up the numbers that you feel the impact."
Whether the city's infrastructure -- including its roads, bridges and sewage systems -- is in shape depends in part on how many people use it. Bridges, for example, are designed not only with weight limits, but to accommodate a certain number of vehicles per hour. "We have one of the highest national ratings in terms of disrepair," Ms. Zimmerman said of New York's bridges. "I can't imagine that 33 million people coming into the city wouldn't stress bridges and tunnels." Calls to the Transportation Department were not returned.
As for the environmental impact of tourism, many New Yorkers point to the double-decker tour buses that spew exhaust fumes, but standing behind a city bus is no pleasure, either. Charles Sturcken, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection, said many double-decker buses are old and exempt from Federal emissions standards, "which is a concern to this agency." He added, "We are working with other city agencies on some type of regulatory answer."
More tourism has brought more traffic. Of the 26.9 million Americans who visited last year, 56 percent came in vehicles, according to the Visitors Bureau. Only 20 percent arrived by bus or train, and 23 percent by plane.
"There are stresses from millions of visitors," said Eric A. Goldstein, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council. "It does contribute to traffic congestion and turning up the noise level a notch or two. The sheer volume has an environmental impact. But that's mostly overwhelmed by the benefits."
Mr. Goldstein said that "despite the quality-of-life issues, tourism is a huge plus for the environment."
For one thing, tourism is easier on the environment than, say, manufacturing, he said. "Without it, the city would be in trouble," Mr. Goldstein said. "And healthy cities are central to protecting natural resources. Without them, you'd see more development of wetlands, shorelines and exurban areas."
But millions of visitors also means more garbage and millions of gallons of additional waste water. "Waste-water treatment plants at North River in Harlem and Newtown Creek in Queens have had lots of community problems with odor," Ms. Zimmerman said. "Has the tourist population been factored into the capacity of these plants?"
Mr. Sturcken of the Environmental Protection Department said it had been, adding that the city discharged some 1.5 billion gallons of water a day into the treatment system, whose capacity is 1.77 billion.
Altering bridges, tunnels and sewage treatment plants to accommodate more people is one thing. Changing the attitudes of New Yorkers is quite another.
"We are a very busy city, we like to move quickly, and there will be times when we may have to adjust," Ms. Reiter said. "But you have to explain to people why it's worth making the adjustment. They must understand the benefits first. That message is just starting to get out, but it's been very, very difficult."
As Dr. Rach put it: "It's going to be bumpy at times. But the city and society have to get involved to smooth those bumps out."
 
Striking a Balance
IF tourism is good, can it be better? Can New York get the most bang from the tourist buck without great cost to its physical and cultural environment? Can it strike a balance that spares certain neighborhoods from overload while allowing others to share the wealth?
Here are some ideas:
 
PLANNING FOR COMPANY -- "Every economic sector needs planning," says Lalia Rach, dean of the Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Travel Administration at New York University. "We need that with tourism: What are we offering and how? What's the infrastructure? How's it maintained?"
In Harlem, community, business and religious leaders are working with the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau to create a tourism council to both attract visitors and get them to stick around.
Maintaining neighborhood character is also a concern. "That's why local residents should be front and center in planning," says Deborah Mitchell, director of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone. "The council will allow people to talk about issues in real time, so small issues don't become big issues."
The idea came from Charleston, S.C., which created a tourism commission in 1978 to manage the industry and preserve neighborhoods. "What comes first is the livability of our communities," says Charleston's Mayor, Joseph P. Riley. "We can have a strong and growing tourism industry and improve the quietude and livability of our neighborhoods."
 
SPREAD IT OUT -- Most tourists visiting Manhattan spend their time below 96th Street. But Fran Reiter, president of the Visitors Bureau, points out that there are a number of cultural institutions outside Manhattan, like the Bronx Zoo and the Brooklyn Museum, "that in any other city would be No. 1 attractions."
To reduce congestion in major Manhattan tourist areas and "spread the wealth around," Ms. Reiter says, tour companies are being encouraged to promote sightseeing outside Manhattan. New York Apple Tours, she says, "made very major investments to take hop-on, hop-off buses to Brooklyn. And we've urged the entire industry to spread its wings into the other boroughs."
 
TAKE THE A TRAIN -- Getting tourists to use mass transit, even those who drive into the city, can help alleviate traffic congestion. And more promotion could familiarize visitors with the advantages of bus and subway travel before they arrive.
An unlimited-ride Metrocard could be "very attractive" for tourists, said the deputy executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Chris Boylan. "We'll be talking about one-day and three-day passes and maybe positioning them for tourists," Mr. Boylan said.
Yet some people "have an outdated impression of the system if they haven't been here for 20 years," he said. "It's much friendlier today."
Groups like the volunteer Big Apple Greeter Program can help visitors navigate the subway system. "They say they wouldn't be caught dead in the subway, until we take them there," said a spokeswoman, Carolyn Stone. "Then they feel like natives."
 
EDUCATING THE MASSES -- "We should make the effort to teach visitors their rights and responsibilities," says Gina Luria Walker, chairwoman of the social sciences department at the New School. She suggests a "clever" list of New York dos and don'ts.
"They could be handed out on airplanes and other points of entry," she says, adding that education campaigns could be conducted through consulates and Mayor Giuliani's office.
In Times Square, meanwhile, the Business Improvement District plans to teach people to use midblock passageways to alleviate sidewalk crowding on the avenues. The B.I.D. intends to put up signs directing foot traffic to the passageways.
 
CRACKDOWN TIME? -- The city regulated the helicopter tour industry after noise complaints from residents. Now some people want double-decker buses to be regulated. "They pollute the air, destroy trees, block side streets, invade privacy, blast loudspeakers, go where they're not allowed and idle beyond the limit," says Councilman Thomas K. Duane.
Earlier this month, Mr. Duane offered a bill banning tour buses from side streets in Greenwich Village, SoHo and Clinton. He and other Council members has also called for a multi-agency task force to deal with the problem, which he says is "spiraling out of control."
 
TO MARKET, TO MARKET -- Overnight business travelers on average spend $220 per day, while leisure travelers spend $123, the Visitors Bureau reports. Brazilians are the biggest spenders over all, at $225 per person per day, followed by Japanese, at $189. By contrast, the French part with just $87 a day and the British, $71. And while 70 percent of overseas visitors participated in a cultural activity while they were in New York, just 40 percent of domestic travelers did.
"Are we getting the consumer we want, one that spends a lot of money?" Dr. Rach asks. "Are we looking for the highest numbers or those tourists who return the most to the city?" She says New York should promote itself in places that cater to upscale, culturally aware travelers. Is there a magazine for overnight Brazilian business travelers? DAVID KIRBY

"WORLD VIEW: Visitors From Abroad"
A total of 6.1 million internatioal visitors traveled to New York in 1997, up 7 percent from 1996. But this year international travel to the city is expected to decline 1 percent because of the Asian economic crisis and an unfavorable exchange rate for Canada. The chart shows how many visitors visited New York City each year since 1990. (Source: New York Convention and Visitors Bureau.)(pg. 12)

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
The Softer They Fall

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
What is the lesson from the rescue of Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn., that's run by John W. Meriwether and a band of Wall Street's savviest traders? That it helps to be big, to be bold and to know the right people.
Wall Streeters not involved in the fund's $3.5 billion bailout by a consortium of large banks and brokerage firms are agog not only at the size of the losses but also at the idea that so speculative a firm would be saved from a demise of its own making. Cries of crony capitalism, Wall Street style, are growing louder. And with some justification. 
 For starters, the deal -- in which companies like J. P. Morgan, Chase Manhattan, Travelers Group and Goldman, Sachs agreed to put up roughly $300 million apiece to stabilize Long-Term Capital -- goes against the advice that American policy makers have been dispensing to tattered economies around the world. If a financial institution is bankrupt, Washington has scolded, it should be allowed to fail. The United States has been especially vocal on this score to officials in Japan.
Then there is the small matter of exactly why these institutions, under the Federal Reserve's sponsorship, came to Long-Term Capital's rescue. According to Sanford I. Weill, chairman of Travelers, the financial industry concluded that a bailout was "the best way to maintain orderly markets."
Mr. Weill is surely right. Forcing Long-Term Capital to liquidate its holdings under pressure would have unleashed a firestorm on already damaged worldwide bond markets. Because Mr. Meriwether had big holdings in junk bonds, for instance, a liquidation of those securities would have clipped their prices badly, hurting individual investors who own high-yield-bond mutual funds.
But the retail investor is only part of the story and hardly the heart of it. The bailout was in the bankers' self-interest, too. Most of the firms that executed Mr. Meriwether's trades piggybacked on them, putting on the same positions. So a mass liquidation of Mr. Meriwether's portfolio would have slashed the value of their holdings. Furthermore, some of the rescuers -- Merrill Lynch and UBS A.G., for example -- had stakes in the fund.
Is the bailout throwing good money after bad? An investment in Long-Term Capital may turn out to be a home run for Merrill Lynch and the other firms, which now have 90 percent ownership of the hedge fund. But the idea that many of these institutions extended so much credit to Long-Term Capital with little understanding of the risks doesn't say much about their management controls.
Some observers find it interesting to compare Mr. Meriwether's treatment with that of another failed investment manager -- Robert Citron, the disgraced former treasurer of Orange County, Calif. As with Mr. Meriwether, Mr. Citron's undoing was a series of wrongheaded interest-rate bets; his caused the county's 1994 bankruptcy.
There are big differences, of course. Mr. Citron was investing with public money, not the funds of high-rolling private investors. And he diverted money from one public account to another. He also was no denizen of Wall Street's corridors, given to wearing turquoise jewelry, not chalk-striped suits.
How many more hedge funds are about to need bailing out? Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, knows that the biggest hazard of one bailout is that it makes people expect another and another. He testified to Congress on the subject 10 days ago. And yet the New York Fed brokered the Long-Term Capital deal.
"That the Fed decided to send a helicopter to sprinkle money over Greenwich means Mr. Greenspan knows that the problem must be so big on the other side," said Stan Jonas, managing director at FIMAT/USA, a broker dealer in New York, referring to the banks. "It must be big, if he's willing to sacrifice principle just to get rid of it."

A Crucial Week for a Frayed Global Safety Net

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
FOR the world's central bankers and finance ministers, this is the week to put up or shut up.
If they do what many analysts now expect, they could provide a much-needed breather for investors in a global economic crisis that began with the devaluation of the Thai currency 15 months ago, has engulfed Russia, is battering Latin America and threatening the United States. 
 But if they disappoint, watch out.
Federal Reserve policy makers meet on Tuesday, and Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has indicated -- but not guaranteed -- that a rate cut is in the offing. "We have to bring the existing instabilities to a level of stability reasonably shortly, to prevent the contagion from really spilling over and creating some very significant further difficulties for all of us," he told Congress last week.
While not a silver bullet, a quarter- or half-point cut in the Fed's short-term interest rate target could ease fears in emerging markets, lessening capital flight. It would also minimize the chances that the American economy would aggravate the crisis by slipping into its own recession.
Taking no action would be a jolt, sending stocks here and around the world lower.
The election for German Chancellor is set for today; Brazilians will select a president a week later. With the elections over, a new German leader (Gerhard Schroder) or the current one (Helmut Kohl) can pay more attention to global problems, a necessity if there is any chance for a global rate cut. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, if he wins a new term, as expected, will have to make good on promises of deficit cuts and Social Security changes. Otherwise, it will be hard to lure back investors.
Then the world's financial leaders will be gathering in Washington at the end of the week, for the semiannual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The Group of Seven leading industrialized countries and the I.M.F. will be expected to do more to calm the waters. On top of the list is some kind of standby bailout package for key Latin American countries like Brazil. If no such deal is done soon, investors should worry about a steeper Latin American downside.
Even though many stock markets have settled into a volatile but contained trading range over the last two weeks, the Fed and the world's leaders still have plenty to worry about, especially in Latin America. Mexico, Brazil and Argentina are where global policy makers will have to make their last stand against a virulent financial crisis that, if left unchecked, could send the whole world into a recession.
Jose M. Barrionuevo, director of global market strategy at Lehman Brothers, has a risk barometer based on a country's level of dollar currency reserves. This level is compared with what would be needed, hypothetically, as a full defense against capital flight, without resorting to unsustainably high interest rates to defend the currency.
On this basis, Brazil and Mexico are still extremely vulnerable to a currency collapse and the economic crisis that would follow. In Brazil, the level of actual reserves is $47.5 billion and the defense level is $200.8 billion. In Mexico, reserves are $30.3 billion and the defense level is $100.6 billion.
"In the absence of additional external and domestic measures, these countries are likely to experience serious foreign exchange devaluation pressures," Mr. Barrionuevo said.
Argentina, which pegged its currency, the peso, to the dollar, is less vulnerable by this measure, with a reserve level of $25 billion and a defense level of $33.6 billion. But Mr. Barrionuevo is still concerned because Argentina's economic health is so dependent, through trade, on Brazil. The Czech Republic is also under threat.
"The support from the Group of Seven and the I.M.F. has to be materializing soon," Mr. Barrionuevo said. The Fed must ease, he added, because Latin America needs to see that the United States is not slowing too much, closing a key export market.
"The world," he warned, "is walking a very fine line."
Look how quickly the Greenspan-inspired, rate-cut euphoria evaporated on Wednesday. Just hours after the Dow finished the day 257 points higher, a $3.5 billion rescue was announced for one of the biggest casualties yet of the financial crisis: Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund founded by John W. Meriwether.
The Dow fell 152 points on Thursday, and for a day Mr. Meriwether's mistakes outweighed Mr. Greenspan's promises. That could make the chairman's search for stability tougher.

HEADLINE: The Nation: In Finance, Bitter Pills Are for Others to Take

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
DO as I say, not as I do.
That was the message in the extraordinary rescue last Wednesday of a prominent but speculative investment firm called Long-Term Capital Management. The rescuers, rallied by none other than the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were a consortium of Wall Street brokerage firms and major banks. Long-Term Capital, a four-year-old firm founded by John W. Meriwether, a former vice-chairman of Salomon Brothers, found itself on the brink of bankruptcy last week after most of its multibillion dollar bets in world stock and bond markets had gone bad. The firm had lost more than $4 billion; the deal to save it required a cash infusion of $3.5 billion.
Since when does the Federal Reserve Bank broker a bailout of an investment firm that was a victim of nothing more than its own bad judgment? An excellent question and one that policy makers in troubled nations around the world may well be scratching their heads over for some time. 
 Why? Because a Fed-sponsored bailout of a speculative investment fund doesn't track with the medicine United States policy makers have been dispensing to financial institutions in distress around the world. Japan, for example, whose banking system is near collapse, has been told repeatedly that tough love is the answer to its predicament. If a bank is insolvent, let it fail and move on. Just say no to the Japanese convoy system, in which healthy banks prop up their unhealthy brethren.
The same has been said to apply to Russia, where the International Monetary Fund's refusal to bail out the economy last summer is another good example of the widespread belief that nobody should be considered too big to fail.
Come closer to home, however, and the story changes. Long-Term Capital was a fund aimed at wealthy individuals and institutions -- minimum investment: $10 million. It had borrowed enough money from the banks and brokerages it did business with to have a portfolio of trades worth $120 billion on capital of roughly $4 billion: Too big to fail.
 
'Undue Moral Hazard'
Never mind that exactly one week prior to the near collapse of the firm, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and as such, the chief bank regulator in the nation, testified to Congress that the problems in the Asian economies were the result of laxity on the part of lenders there. Mr. Greenspan said that banks and financial institutions that are in trouble should be helped carefully so as not to encourage further reckless lending. "Any temporary financial assistance must be carefully tailored to be conditional and not encourage undue moral hazard," he said.
Appearing at a high school in Washington on Friday, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin spoke about the investment firm debacle. He said: "This is not a bailout; there's no public money. It was a decision by the private sector that their economic interests lay in these arrangements."
Sounds rather like Japan's convoy system, no?

What Privacy Rights?

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
A recent report out of Washington tells a story about Dr. Louis Hafken, a psychiatrist in Providence, R.I., who received a letter from a company that reviews prescription drug benefits for insurers and employers.
The letter contained what should have been confidential information about one of Dr. Hafken's patients, including a printout of her prescription records. It noted that she was taking Ativan, an anti-anxiety drug. The company wanted to know why. Was the patient depressed, or suffering from panic disorder, or experiencing alcohol withdrawal? Did the doctor plan to continue giving her Ativan? 
 The doctor did not provide the requested information. "Frankly," he was quoted as saying, "it's none of their business."
The patient was naturally upset to learn that her employer had examined the records of her psychiatric treatment. The implications of such snooping are obvious. Dr. Hafken said many of his patients "are afraid to be completely honest in therapy" because they fear that people other than their doctors will learn of matters that were supposed to have remained secret.
They have reason to be worried. We are very close to the day when strangers will know, or will be able to know, anything they want about you.
Your financial profile and buying habits have long since been catalogued and traded like baseball cards. Your medical records, supposedly secure, are not. Your boss may well be monitoring your telephone conversations and E-mail. Hidden video cameras have been installed -- sometimes legally and sometimes not -- in dressing rooms and public bathrooms. Thieves armed with your Social Security number can actually hijack your identity.
"Nothing Sacred -- the Politics of Privacy" is a report released last month by the Center for Public Integrity, a highly regarded nonpartisan research organization. The report warned that the privacy of Americans "is being compromised and invaded from many angles" and asserted that Congress has not done nearly enough to slow the assault.
"Time and again," said Charles Lewis, director of the center, "Congress has put the economic interests of various privacy invaders ahead of the privacy interests of the American public."
According to the report, Congress first heard testimony that there were problems keeping medical records confidential in 1971. But it still has not passed legislation designed to curb the abuses.
So you still get cases like that of Mark Hudson, a former insurance company employee who told The Times in 1996 that he was shocked to find during his computer training that he could call up the records of any of the company's subscribers, including information about his own psychiatric treatment and the antidepressant medication he was taking.
"I can tell you unequivocally that patient confidentiality is not eroding," he said. "It can't erode because it's simply nonexistent."
The right to privacy in the workplace is virtually nonexistent as well.
"Most people assume that Federal laws protect Americans from being spied upon in the workplace," said the report. "To the contrary, over the years Congress has rejected legislation spelling out basic privacy protections for employees."
In addition to the possible monitoring of telephone conversations and E-mail, workers are frequently subjected to the scrutiny of hidden video cameras, can be required to type at computers that monitor the number of errors they make and the number of breaks they take, and often are compelled to provide urine samples and submit to psychological exams.
For some jobs, the scrutiny is reasonable. For others, it is not. In all cases it should be properly regulated, and the guidelines should be clear. That is not what is happening. As the center's report noted, Congress has gone out of its way to preserve the right of employers to eavesdrop and otherwise spy upon and collect personal data on their employees.
For decades, privacy advocates have called for legislation that would spell out and guarantee a citizen's basic right to privacy. But tremendous amounts of money are being made from the rampant transfer of the most personal types of information. The huge corporate interests and others that benefit from that gold mine do not want it sealed.

Danger: Tangled Web of Taxes

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
MICHAEL O. LEAVITT was visiting California from Utah a few months back, and while staying at a beach house used his laptop computer to shop over the Internet. He accessed a website, made his selections and charged the bill -- $44.50 plus $2.49 for shipping -- to his credit card.
But he did not pay sales tax. That bothered him because, as Governor of Utah, Mr. Leavitt is acutely aware of how reliant states are on sales taxes. And he has given considerable thought to the looming problems -- for states, the economy and consumers -- of relying on traditional tax systems in a world in which Internet commerce is starting to change the way people shop. 
 "Which states could logically and reasonably have argued that they should receive the benefits of that tax?" Mr. Leavitt asked about his purchase. "California? I was sitting in California when I made the transaction. New York? New York was where the home page was resident and where the company was located. But the goods were packaged and shipped from a warehouse in New Jersey, and they were shipped to Utah, where I used them."
 
Great Potential
Governments have long grappled with how, if at all, they should regulate the global flow of images and information over the Internet, seeking to balance concerns about free speech, for example, with those about pornography. But only recently have policy makers in Washington, in state capitals and around the world begun to confront the economic implications of a new retail marketplace that recognizes no political or geographical boundaries.
Almost by the day, the new medium is showing its potential for rapid growth. At Amazon.com, the online bookseller, the latest chapter in President Clinton's woes led to a surge of orders for the book version of Kenneth W. Starr's report to Congress and then for the video of Mr. Clinton's grand jury appearance (both briefly topped Stephen King's latest on the company's best seller list). Catalog companies are increasingly giving customers the option to place orders over the Internet.
"You have a major economic force here," said Ira Magaziner, who heads the Clinton Administration's Internet policy team. "It's just beginning to reach the consumer, and it's going to be huge. The question is, how do we create an environment that will allow it to flourish and also will take care of all the side effects that will arise?"
The issues are sweeping. Where does a transaction take place when buyer and seller can be defined to be in multiple locations? Will the borderless nature of the Internet force governments further down a road that has already led them to drop trade barriers, harmonize tax policies and form currency unions?
On a more immediate level, many governors and state legislatures are convinced that such commerce will present in greatly magnified form the same problem they have faced for years with the L. L. Beans of the world that sell by phone and mail from catalogues: Although consumers are technically liable for sales taxes, companies have to collect taxes only in states where they keep a physical presence. Although some merchants collect the tax even where they are not required to do so, most do not.
Barnes & Noble's barnesandnoble.com, another online bookseller, automatically adds sales tax to orders being shipped to New York, where it has its corporate headquarters; New Jersey, where it has its distribution center, and Virginia, where its computer operation is based. Orders elsewhere go untaxed.
The lost revenue for states is relatively trivial now, but could mount substantially in coming years as the volume of business on the Internet grows. Though estimates vary widely, some analysts see the electronic market growing to hundreds of billions of dollars annually within the next decade from next to nothing a few years ago.
 
Billions Lost
By early in the next decade, states could be losing up to $12 billion a year, according to the National Governors' Association. That would be a big chunk of state sales tax revenue, which last year totaled $150 billion, and would be three times what states say they lose each year because of out-of-state mail-order purchases.
The states are also under pressure from traditional retailers, who see their Internet competitors as operating in a tax-free zone that will draw customers away from Main Street and the mall.
From the perspective of technology companies and on-line service providers, the issue is whether they will become a tempting target for new taxes, or the object of discriminatory policies intended to benefit traditional retailers. A tax free-for-all, they and their supporters warn, will stifle the new marketplace and deny its economic benefits to the country.
"It is incumbent upon us to get it right so that we do not allow a feeding frenzy by state and local tax collectors across the world to turn the information superhighway into an empty 21st-century toll road," said Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon.
Some experts suggested the problem can be solved by an agreement among the states to levy taxes based on residence and then creating software that would automatically add the appropriate amount to any Internet purchase as part of the credit card billing process.
Such a system could also automatically route the tax to the proper state.
But getting the balance right between nurturing the new medium and not hurting states and traditional retailers is no easy proposition.
In Congress, the Senate is debating a bill cosponsored by Mr. Wyden that would establish a two-year moratorium on any new taxes that would treat Internet commerce differently from traditional retailing, while establishing a commission to sort out the sales tax issue. A similar bill passed the House in June.
 
Wary of Washington
Washington's increasing interest has made the states nervous. Some governors fear that the growth of Internet commerce will encourage the Federal Government to create and administer a consistent sales tax system.
"The I.R.S. will say, we'll collect it, and Congress will say, we'll appropriate it," said Mr. Leavitt, a Republican. "We'll have taxes now collected and spent by local governments collected and spent by the Federal Government. That's a massive shift in power."
Another concern in the technology industry and in Washington is that other countries could slap duties, tariffs or other trade barriers on international Internet transactions, either to raise revenue or protect their domestic industries, and create new taxes for transactions within their borders. The Clinton Administration has already raised the issue at the World Trade Organization.
"Governments around the world are beginning to understand the power of this medium, and it's something a lot of people are wrestling with," said Ben Boyd, a spokesman for barnesandnoble.com. "It's a new medium and you need to look at everything through new lenses."

The Fed Should Do More Than Cut Rates

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan wants to cut interest rates, which means the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee is likely to do just that when it meets Tuesday. But the meeting may still be contentious because there are two very different worlds that will be affected.
In the first world, which includes the United States, there are only limited signs of problems. The labor market is tight, wages are rising and consumers are spending at a pace strong enough to offset a weakening industrial sector. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 14 percent from its highs, but still up for the year. Speculative juices continue to flow. Looking at that world, one might expect the Fed to raise interest rates, but never to cut them. 
 Then there is the other world, which includes Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. It is characterized by what Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs calls "fear, uncertainty, doubt and despair." It is a world that has seen currencies and stock markets plunge, with credit crunches and recessions in many countries. That world desperately needs help, which lower American interest rates might provide.
 Moreover, it is hard to believe that those two worlds can continue on their different paths indefinitely. "It is just not credible that the United States, or for that matter Europe, can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress," Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told the Senate Budget Committee last week.
As it happens, Mr. Greenspan knew something when he testified that the rest of us were soon going to find out. It was that the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, run by John Meriwether, was in danger of collapsing. (By coincidence, the insolvent Japanese bank whose fate has paralyzed the Japanese political system is the Long-Term Credit Bank. Does all this discredit long-term investing?) On the same day Mr. Greenspan testified, bankers meeting at the New York Fed's offices agreed to pony up $3.5 billion to keep the fund from liquidating.
A few weeks ago, it appeared that investors were in retreat everywhere. But in New York, the most speculative stocks have roared back, while other shares have stabilized. Consider the Internet stocks. Yahoo plunged 43 percent over a period of less than two months this summer, bottoming on Sept. 1. Since then the stock has more than doubled. Last week, after a prolonged period in which Wall Street brought no initial public offerings to market, another Internet company, Ebay, went public. Priced at $18, the shares leaped to more than $50. The 31-year-old founder now has stock worth $692 million. He paid $14,262 for the shares.
There are those who think that speculation should be of no concern to the Fed, but Mr. Greenspan at times has indicated he was worried. The collapse in Asia would not be this bad had not speculators first flooded the region with capital, then all tried to take their money and run at about the same time. The renewal of the Internet craze can be seen as a sign of the kind of froth that caused Mr. Greenspan to coin the phrase "irrational exuberance," and lowering interest rates might simply encourage more of it.
So what is the Fed to do? There is a risk that it will lower rates only a bit, doing too little for the rest of the world because it fears being too stimulative in this country. But a bold alternative would be to cut rates meaningfully while also discouraging speculation by raising the margin requirements for stock purchases. Investors have been able to buy stocks with a 50 percent down payment since Jan. 3, 1974, when the Fed cut the rate from 65 percent in the midst of a severe bear market.
To be sure, such a change would not put much of a damper on hedge funds, which have ways, using derivatives, to speculate while putting up far less capital than 50 percent. Some in Congress want to curb that speculation, although it is not easy to see how it could be done without simply driving the business offshore. But smaller speculators are subject to Fed rules. It will be interesting to see if the Fed even considers doing something about them.

HEADLINE: Reducing Russian Nuclear Dangers

 BODY:
Russia's idle nuclear weapons complexes are dangerously short of money, leaving thousands of skilled scientists and workers unpaid or unemployed. Some may be tempted to sell their expertise to countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq that are trying to develop nuclear weapons of their own. But the Russians could put their skills to work for their own country's commercial and social benefit, if funds were provided to train and employ them.
That is the purpose of a welcome new Russian-American agreement signed last week in Vienna. Though the $30 million funding envisioned for the next budget year is modest compared with the size of the problem, the agreement marks a healthy recognition by both countries that despite political changes in Moscow, they share an urgent interest in containing the spread of Russia's nuclear know-how and materials to other nations. 
 The money will go mainly toward retraining nuclear scientists for work in private businesses and encouraging the conversion of nuclear weapons and missile plants to commercial operations like the production of auto parts. Future efforts should go further, including conversion to non-commercial work, like cleaning up after nuclear accidents
and developing new methods of determining whether arms-control agreements are strictly enforced.
 Moscow has been looking to create 30,000 to 50,000 jobs for its nuclear weapons workers over the next three to five years. Those numbers have probably increased because of Russia's economic problems. Ideally, the United States and its European allies should be contributing about $100 million a year toward solving this problem. The Administration has been proceeding cautiously in deference to Congressional conservatives who seem unwilling to recognize that the cold war is over and that American national security can sometimes best be served by cooperation with Moscow.
Russia and America began cooperating to defuse cold-war nuclear perils even before the end of Communist rule in Moscow. Though the new Russian Government led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is retreating from economic reform, there is no sign of any retreat on arms control issues. In fact, Mr. Primakov has announced his intention to press Russia's parliament to ratify the long-stalled nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States. The nuclear complex conversion agreement indicates an interest in addressing other aspects of the nuclear weapons problem as well. It is in America's interest to respond generously.

HEADLINE: The Good Leader;
In Presidents, Virtues Can Be Flaws (and Vice Versa)

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON's admitted immoral behavior has thrust to the forefront a fundamental question about the meaning of the American Presidency: Should the President be a moral leader? And if so, what is a moral leader?
Contrasting themselves with Mr. Clinton, candidates around the country are declaring that they are virtue personified. They are emphasizing their families and the values by which they live. They are making the point, in essence, that moral leaders are role models. 
 Yet for some politicians, the definition of a moral leader has little to do with personal rectitude, with fearing God, being faithful to a spouse or abjuring untruths and devious business practices. They say the moral leader is the one who seizes upon the power of high office to enact policies that clarify national ideals and to inspire the people, summoning society to greatness.
Lincoln was famous for both. He steered the nation through the Civil War, boldly fought to free the slaves and was not bashful about pressing against perceived public opinion. Personally, he was Honest Abe, and also a man so modest and unassuming that he wrote shortly before he was first elected, "I do not think myself fit for Presidency."
But the ability to combine personal purity with the political skills to lead the nation toward larger civic accomplishments has eluded most Presidents. Given the choice, Americans these days appear willing to put up with a leader who has personal flaws, even serious ones.
 
Short of the Ideal
In a nationwide New York Times/ CBS News Poll conducted last week, only 21 percent of the public said it was most important that Presidents serve as moral role models; 65 percent said it was more important that Presidents do their job well.
"In an ideal world, the President would be the paragon of virtue," said former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the New York Democrat. "The reality is that no human has been able to reach the ideal of leadership in which they reflect the best of virtue all the time. We don't trust politicians to be our moral arbiter. We'd like them to be. But we don't expect it."
Former Senator Mike Mansfield, a Montana Democrat and longtime Senate majority leader, argued that there cannot help but be diminished expectations in an age when Presidents face great scrutiny. After all, today they are expected to reveal the type of underwear they prefer.
"There was a time when people expected Presidents to be Superman," said Mr. Mansfield, who is 95. "But that time is long gone. The Presidency and the people are now being drawn closer and closer together due to the media. No President is on the pedestal any more."
That does not mean that people no longer yearn for leaders whom they view as beyond reproach. Still, most people probably look for the qualities that they most desire at the moment. With the economy humming along and the nation secure, there is probably no special demand for inspiring leadership.
Henry F. Graff, a professor emeritus of history at Columbia University, said "the wheel of history has to turn fortuitously" for a President to have the opportunity to exhibit moral leadership.
"You don't know whether a person is a moral leader unless they have something to lead for," he said. "Wars and depressions are good places to show off leadership."
Herbert Hoover, for example, was so scrupulously honest that he did not collect his salary as President. (He was also a millionaire.) But his efforts to be a moral leader were spoiled by the Great Depression. One of the few Presidents who is widely regarded as a true moral leader during a time of peace was Theodore Roosevelt, who from his "bully pulpit" preached again and again about honesty in Government.
For all the talk of integrity, some people may not be more comfortable with a President who commands the same personal respect as, say, a member of the clergy. To reach the highest elective office, a person, no matter how upright in public, has to be a master at the inherently devious game of politics.
A common perception is that politicians who are too clean may find it too distasteful to do some of the unsavory things that a President must do, like outmaneuver political opponents.
"We don't necessarily want them to be Mother Teresa -- We don't necessarily want them to be pure as can be," said Thomas E. Cronin, an authority on American Presidents and president of Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash. "The world of international affairs requires a toughness of demeanor."
There is a rich history of Presidents who, personally, were viewed as beyond reproach but never accomplished much for the country. Just the same, Presidents considered rogues are viewed as successful moral leaders.
While known for his Christian principles, Woodrow Wilson's naivete in dealing with the European powers helped set the stage for World War II, and his off-putting aloofness disposed the nation to elect the more genial, and flawed, Warren G. Harding as his successor. After Mr. Harding's death in 1923, his Vice President, Calvin Coolidge, succeeded him and restored respectability to a White House blackened by Teapot Dome and other scandals. "Cautious Cal" was a New England Calvinist known for his morality, honesty and frugality. But he was also conspicuously shy, a wooden speaker and failed to win passage of much of his legislative agenda.
More recently, John F. Kennedy has been remembered for having endless trysts. While his unfaithfulness wasn't generally known at the time, his virility enhanced his stature then and, more important, still does to some extent today. Lyndon B. Johnson, himself no exemplar of marital fidelity, had an admired reputation for effective leadership that owed much to the fact that he was a dirty political infighter.
No one ever questioned the uprightness of President Gerald R. Ford or his successor, Jimmy Carter, who in the 1976 campaign presented himself as an antidote to the dishonesty of government in the Watergate era. "I don't intend to break a single promise," he vowed in the campaign.
Yet for all his trustworthiness, Mr. Carter was never able to parlay his personal character into effective championing of larger societal values during his tenure. And neither Mr. Ford nor Mr. Carter has been viewed as particularly effective Presidents.
 
Eye of Beholder
Just about any President would be considered downright charming, and virtuous, if compared with Andrew Jackson, a dictatorial, nasty, temperamental man who always seemed to find himself facing down an opponent in a duel with a pistol. But that did not prevent Mr. Jackson from earning a place in history as a respectable President symbolizing abiding national values.
And Franklin D. Roosevelt, the President viewed by many as America's most effective moral leader this century -- revered even as he forced Americans to make huge personal sacrifices in the Depression and in World War II -- was hardly a role model in private life. He engaged in a years-long clandestine affair with Lucy Mercer, a former social secretary.
Decades later, Richard M. Nixon, in his first inaugural address, tried to muster the American spirit by invoking God repeatedly and declaring, "We can build a great cathedral of the spirit." Mr. Nixon, of course, became the first President to be forced from office because of ethical misdeeds, although many people still insist that he was an effective leader, particularly in foreign policy.
Moral leadership is often in the eye of the beholder. Mr. Mansfield, for one, said he considers Harry S. Truman the last true moral leader in the White House because he combined high ethics in his private and public life. Yet despite the moniker "Honest Harry," Mr. Truman never could completely shake off the taint of his ties to the suspect Missouri political machine of Tom Pendergast. And Mr. Truman was not particularly popular when he was President; only recently have historians portrayed him as a heroic figure.
William Kristol, a Republican whose magazine, The Weekly Standard, promotes the view that moral leadership is more than personal conduct, said Ronald Reagan was the last truly moral leader. "Reagan really had a certain personal dignity," he said. "It was a great moral achievement of Reagan that he won the cold war. And that depended on his having his own personal moral grounding in his belief that he really was right."
But others cited Mr. Reagan's poor relations with his children and contrasted his expressions of devoutness with his failure to attend church regularly. "He could make the lofty statement on the beach on the anniversary of D-Day," Mr. Graff said. "But there was a feeling that there was something not quite real about him. He didn't stand 20-feet tall."
The most blatant distinction between a President's personal morals and public values was drawn by Steve Grossman, national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, speaking, as Mr. Clinton looked on, at a recent fund-raising event in New York. "Mr. President," he said, "it seems to me that you have demonstrated, at least in my adult lifetime, a higher commitment to the kind of moral leadership that I value in public service and public policy than any person I have ever met."
That tribute was hotly disputed by Republicans; even some Democrats in the room at the time rolled their eyes. With characteristic understatement, Bob Dole, who was defeated by Mr. Clinton in the 1996 campaign, said, "The D.N.C. chairman, I think, went overboard."
Republicans, and even many Democrats, these days prefer the definition of a moral leader as a role model. Republican Party officials contend that the personal values of candidates have eclipsed everything else as the most crucial issue in the November elections.
Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who is considering a run for the White House in 2000, volunteered on national TV recently that he had not had an extramarital affair. At a convention of the Christian Coalition the other day, another Republican contender, Steve Forbes, allied himself with Teddy Roosevelt.
"I have been drawn to him because he understood the enormous power of the American Presidency to shape our culture, not simply through the force of laws but through the power of persuasion," Mr. Forbes said of Mr. Roosevelt, adding, "Like Ronald Reagan, he had a compass and a core."
 
Risks
But the danger of campaigning on moral authority is that Republicans risk being viewed as considering themselves holier-than-thou. "There has to be a very delicate calibration in calling for moral leadership without appearing to be haughty or self-righteous," said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist and the Christian Coalition's former executive director. "The challenge is more on the Republican side to affirm rather than condemn, to elevate right behavior rather than attack wrong behavior."
When Jimmy Carter ran for President, he did not repudiate Presidents Nixon and Ford as much as he tried to promote the general healing of the nation. Some Republican strategists said they feared that Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, who may run for President in 2000, was skating at the line of appropriateness when he said, "We have a President who views a vulnerable woman from the perspective of a predator."
Mr. Clinton himself was asked the other day if he had the moral authority to lead the nation. "That is something you have to demonstrate every day," he said.
That will not be easy. "He was probably at his peak when he could stand up and talk about family values," said Leon Panetta, Mr. Clinton's former chief of staff. "Now it would not be wise for him to talk about values except in the sense of contrition and the personal pain he's been through."
Yet even if he avoids the subject, kindling a national debate over morality in government may be Mr. Clinton's lasting legacy.

HEADLINE: The 'Third Way' Is No Route to Paradise

BYLINE: By Tony Judt; Tony Judt is director of the Remarque Institute at New York University.

 BODY:
Each age has its cliche. Ours is the "third way." Hardly a week passes without a public figure in Britain, Germany or the United States hailing the coming of the third way: the new, "post-ideological" approach to politics and policy making. Sociologists theorize about it, policy seminars promote it, Presidents and prime ministers bask in the reflected glory of its modest ambitions. No reasonable person can dissent; the bad old days of big projects, of left and right, are gone for good. The political goals of the third way are small goals -- and in the cliche of an earlier age, small is beautiful.
Much of this is humbug, of course. In the English-speaking world the third way is just a new label for an old electoral tactic -- "triangulating" between ideas and voters to maximize short-term advantage. Tony Blair's Government -- the European reference for contemporary effusions about a third way -- is the natural child of Margaret Thatcher (much as Reagan begat Clinton). She swung the political pendulum so aggressively against compassion and government intervention that for the first time a government of the "left" could occupy ground somewhere to the right of center and get credit for radical intentions just by standing still and emoting fuzzily. New Labor's third way is opportunism with a human face. 
 If there were a third way, what would it be? Different, presumably, from the first and second ways. So what were those? Big government and little government? Communism and capitalism? This is the conventional assumption: that the choice facing us used to be between the free market and all-controlling regimes. Now that we've abandoned those two doctrinal poles, the argument goes, we can resolve their contradictions, pragmatically, with user-friendly governments, free but compassionate markets, the best of all possible worlds in a supermarket of social choices.
Capitalism, however, is a protean form of economic life, already half a millennium old. It is compatible with a multitude of social arrangements. (The United States is a capitalist society; so is Sweden.) But the purest form of capitalist society -- unfettered markets and the minimal state -- has never existed, and few have sought it. Thus the debate has centered on deciding which social arrangements are desirable and feasible within a market economy.
For Continental Europeans, the third way is not a new phrase. Between the wars it was the self-description of rural populists in Eastern Europe and was a favorite buzzword of Fascist intellectuals everywhere -- Fascism being the third way between capitalist anarchy and Communist dictatorship.
In the 1960's, the third way was a short-lived optimistic alternative to official Communist practices, proposed by Hungarian and Polish economists reluctant to abandon completely their faith in the collectivist state. Today, in former Communist countries, it is not optimistic but defensive. Advocates of a third way defend threatened peasants and workers against the destabilizing impact of exposure to Western competition and the withdrawal of public services.
In Western Europe the debate between the first and second ways has long since lost its meaning. Some form of compromise between unfettered markets and activist big government has been the normal experience of life everywhere since World War II. The precise balance has varied, ranging from capital-labor cooperation through limited state ownership to West Germany's social-market economy.
Until recently these arguments were not contentious. Even today it is hard for politicians to win office without promising to preserve the services to which West Europeans of all classes are deeply attached.
That is why whoever wins the German elections this weekend will have almost no room to maneuver in domestic policy: Gerhard Schroder, the leader of the Social Democrats, who is challenging Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his Christian Democrats, has campaigned for months on the slogan that he represents the "new middle," while taking care never to say what that means. Mr. Kohl, meanwhile, has been more outspoken on the need to reduce spending but has been reluctant to say anything that might arouse voter hostility.
If Mr. Schroder and other European politicians pay lip service to the need to rethink the state, it is not because they or the voters are searching for a new politics. It is that the expansive postwar years are over and the children of the baby boom, as they age, are looking forward to pensions and medical services that their governments cannot afford in an era of much slower growth.
West Europeans have a problem that in this respect is analogous to the more urgent problems facing countries farther east. National policies are driven less by global forces than by local memories. The European welfare state was everywhere a response to the economic collapse of the interwar years and the political disasters that followed.
Politicians who propose even a modest dismantling of it risk incurring wrath: Prime Minister Goran Persson of Sweden was forced to hurry back to Stockholm last week, canceling his appearance at a New York academic seminar on the third way, after the voters expressed their distaste for his mild fiscal reforms by handing his Social Democratic Party a stinging setback -- a nice case of practice trumping theory.
In the long run, perhaps, market forces may triumph. But in the long run, as Keynes reminded us, we are all dead. In the meantime, the Anglo-American third way -- with its blissful confidence in the dismantling of centralized public services and social safety nets -- is the wrong answer to a question that most European voters aren't asking. It is one thing to reduce political expectations in times of prosperity -- which is what has happened in the United States and Britain. It is quite another to emphasize the sins of big government as we enter a period of insecurity and uncertainty.
The history of our century assuredly illustrates the risks of too much government. But the hands-on state has done good things too. Unless today's advocates of a third way can offer a social vision that transcends their Panglossian economic recipes, they will open a vacuum in public life, a space that will be filled by third way-ers of the older sort, whose populist and xenophobic prescriptions are already attracting interest in Norway, France, Austria, eastern Germany and much of Southeastern Europe, not to mention Russia. Mere pragmatism in public affairs was never enough. Politics is about more than just processes. It is about outcomes, too. If there is to be a "way" ever enumerated, then it needs to hold out the promise of leading somewhere. Meanwhile, if we must live by cliches, we need a better one.

HEADLINE: Public Face of Terror Suspect: Low-Key Family Man

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Sept. 26

 BODY:
His business card said he was the director of Africa Help, a nongovernmental relief organization, and he told friends that he supplemented his income by trading in precious stones. He lived unspectacularly in a close-knit middle-class housing development. A father of six, he sent the oldest to a primary school, where his wife was active in the Parent Teachers Association.
That was the public face here of Wahid el Hage, an American-educated urban planner who said he once worked for the cities of Tuscon, Ariz., and Dallas, and whose American wife yearned for her native land. 
 Out of the public eye, according to recent Federal indictments, Mr. el Hage was a leader in the Kenyan branch of a terrorist organization, Al Qaeda, which is run by Osama bin Laden, the man believed to be the mastermind of last month's bombings of the American Embassies here and in neighboring Tanzania.
Mr. el Hage has not been charged in connection with the bombings, but he has been indicted on multiple counts of lying about his relationship to members of the bin Laden organization. On Thursday, he pleaded not guilty in Federal district court in Manhattan.
As the investigation into the bombing unfolds, it emerges that the face of terrorism in the 1990's is not that of a young, unemployed firebrand. Rather it is a middle-class family man, well integrated into the community. While plotting terrorist actions against the United States, the perpetrators have jobs, even if they are covers, sign contracts, live in good neighborhoods, marry and have children while covertly plotting terrorist actions against the United States, according to the indictments.
One of Mr. el Hage's top aides was Haroun Fazil, who wrote reports directly to Mr. bin Laden while living with Mr. el Hage, according to the indictments. A few weeks before the bombing, Mr. Fazil, who taught Mr. el Hage's children the Koran, moved with his wife, two small children and ailing father-in-law into their own place, a modern, two-story house on a half-acre lot in a suburb on the north side of Nairobi It was there that the bomb was partly assembled, according to the indictments.
The Fazil family kept to themselves. No one suspected anything.
In 1994, Mr. Fazil and Mr. el Hage went to a wedding in the coastal city of Mombasa. The bride was a Kenyan woman. The groom was a commercial fisherman, Mohamed Saddiq Odeh. He had also moved to Kenya in 1994, the same year as Mr. el Hage, and had been set up in business by Al Qaeda, and then returned the income to the terrorist organization, according to the indictments. He is now in jail in New York, charged in the bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi.
After the ceremony, Mr. el Hage drove the bride and groom home.
"He was just an ordinary, quiet, middle-class person," a family friend, Abdul-Aziz bin Franklin, said about Mr. el Hage.
"I'm almost 100 percent sure they were not involved, certainly not his wife," said Nuru Abdul-Aziz, Mr. bin Franklin's Kenyan wife. When there were television reports about terrorism, Mr. el Hage's wife, an American whose maiden name is April Ray, expressed strenuous disapproval of terrorism and Islamic militancy, Mrs. Abdul-Aziz said.
A convert to Islam, like her husband, Mrs. el Hage dressed from head to toe in black, with only an opening for eyes, Mrs. Abdul-Aziz said. She described her friend as a housewife who spent a lot of time cooking Arabic food and was homesick for America. "She talked about America like it was heaven," said Mrs. Abdul-Aziz, who added that she did not know where Mrs. el Hage came from in the United States.
Mrs. el Hage often gave clothes to Nairobi's street children, Mrs. Abdul-Aziz said, even though the el Hage family was not -- ostensibly, anyway -- well-off.
The two families met through their children, who were attending the Nairobi Muslim Academy and were excited about the fact that they had American fathers, Mr. bin Franklin said. Mr. bin Franklin, who was born in Beasley, Ark., and graduated from U.C.L.A. with a degree in bacteriology, immigrated to Kenya in 1979, and converted to Islam a year later.
According to papers he filed with the Kenyan Government, Mr. el Hage was born in Sidon, Lebanon, on July 25, 1960. When he came to the United States is unknown. He attended the University of Southwestern Louisiana from 1978 to 1986, receiving a bachelor's degree in urban planning, the university said by telephone on Friday. From 1987 to 1990, he worked as an urban planner for the city of Tucson, and from 1990 to 1992 for the Dallas Planning Committee, Mr. el Hage said in papers he filed with the Kenyan Government. On Friday, a spokesman for the Dallas planning office said there was no record of Mr. el Hage having worked there. Officials in Tucson said they could not immediately confirm Mr. el Hage's story.
In New York, a Federal prosecutor suggested that the Government had evidence that indirectly tied Mr. el Hage to a mysterious 1991 killing in Brooklyn -- and thus, potentially, to the blind Egyptian cleric Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and the circle of Islamic militants convicted in connection with the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.
The victim, Mustapha Shalabi, had been Sheik Abdel-Rahman's sponsor when he entered the United States and had also run an organization that raised money and recruited volunteers for the rebels fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan.
But the two split in 1991, when the Sheik demanded that half the money be diverted from the now-victorious Afghans to be used instead to overthrow President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. In March of that year, Mr. Shalabi's body was discovered in his home in Seagate, Brooklyn, beaten, shot and repeatedly stabbed.
The Assistant United States Attorney, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, said at a hearing at which Mr. el Hage was denied bail that Mr. el Hage had arrived in New York about a week before Mr. Shalabi's body was found in order to take over direction of the Alkifah refugee organization.
In 1993, Mr. el Hage was in Sudan, where he met Mr. bin Laden and became his personal secretary, according to the indictment.
The next year, Mr. el Hage and his family moved to Kenya. He signed a one-year lease on house No. 1523 in Fedha Estates, an "upper-working-class development," as a Fedha officer described it, on drab, flat land east of downtown Nairobi.
The rent for the first year was 20,000 Kenyan shillings, payable in quarterly installments, increased to 25,000 shillings the next year, the equivalent of about $500 a month at today's exchange rate.
The owner of the house, Abdi Ali Dere, recalled in an interview that sometimes Mr. el Hage would be a month or two late with his rent. Otherwise there was nothing about Mr. el Hage that made him stand out from other tenants, Mr. Dere said.
Mr. bin Franklin also thought his friend seemed to be struggling financially, and he and his wife, in the Muslim tradition of helping the less well-off, would often take the large el Hage family chicken and other food. "I kind of wondered how he was managing financially," Mr. bin Franklin said.
Mr. el Hage's business card said that he was the director of Africa Help, a nongovernmental organization that was said to be engaged in health and education projects in several Kenyan towns.
American and Kenyan officials have said that some Muslim relief agencies are fronts for terrorist operations, and after the bomb blasts here, the Kenyan Government ordered six nongovernmental organizations to cease activities and expelled some of the leaders. The organizations have challenged the order in court, except for Africa Help, which also went by the name Help Africa People.
In the registration papers Mr. el Hage filed with the Kenyan Government, Mr. el Hage said the organization's main office was in Heidelberg, Germany. The German Embassy here said it had no information about the organization. The Kenyan Government had no contacts for the organization other than Mr. el Hage.
Mr. el Hage listed Aadil Habib as one of the organization's local officers. During questioning by a grand jury looking into Mr. bin Laden's activities, Mr. el Hage denied ever knowing Mr. Habib, according to the indictment. The indictment says Mr. Habib, who was also known as Abu Ubaidah al-Banshiri, was a military commander in Al Qaeda organization, and that he died in a ferry boat accident on Lake Victoria in 1996.
Mr. el Hage's friend in Nairobi, Mr. bin Franklin, did not know any of that, nor have any reason to suspect Mr. el Hage.
Until August a year ago.
That was when the F.B.I. came to Mr. el Hage's house here and questioned him about his relationship to Mr. bin Laden. The agents took his laptop computer, Mr. el Hage told Mr. bin Franklin.
After the questioning, Mr. el Hage gave the landlord the required month's notice, sold off some appliances, and left Kenya.
"He left in a hurry," said Mr. bin Franklin.

HEADLINE: Opposition And Leaders In Japan Save Bank Rescue

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Japan's governing party and the opposition patched up a basic agreement today on legislation to revive the banking system. The latest agreement, if it sticks, may dispel concerns that Japan's political paralysis will continue to hobble its economy.
The parties had reached an agreement earlier, on Sept. 18, but it began unraveling just as Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and President Clinton were meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss global economic problems. Markets here and around the world had been concerned that if the deal fell apart completely, Japan's economic troubles would worsen and spread around the world. 
 With today's agreement, a set of long-awaited financial laws could be passed by the Parliament by Oct. 7, when the current Parliament session ends. The new laws would set up a mechanism for strengthening Japan's banks, dealing with large bank failures, and confronting the problem of bad loans that are at the heart of Japan's economic crisis.
"This is an epoch-making moment," said Naoto Kan, head of the Democratic Party, the main opposition, according to the newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
While American officials are likely to be relieved that a deal has been struck, they may not be entirely pleased with its terms.
In the last few days, American officials from President Clinton on down have been calling on Japan to use public funds to rescue failing banks and thereby avert a possible large-scale panic. Today's agreement, however, specifies that the Government will not use taxpayers' money to bail out the Long-Term Credit Bank, one of the world's largest and weakest financial institutions.
Instead, the Government will nationalize the bank by purchasing common shares in the bank at a low price. The question of using taxpayers' money to boost the capital base of ailing banks before they go under has been a nagging crucial question over the last few weeks.
The terms of the deal are still a bit unclear. But it seems that for now the Government will not move to bail out banks unless they are on the verge of collapse and may not be able to repay depositors. If a bank is that desperate, then the Government presumably will intervene by nationalizing the bank.
The agreement also calls for the Government to examine how taxpayers' money could be used to increase the capital of weak banks that are still viable.
Under today's agreement, the Long-Term Credit Bank would temporarily be put under state control. It might then be transformed into a bridge bank that would separate out the good loans and worthy borrowers and sell or try to collect on the bad loans. The Government would then try to resell the viable part of the bank to another institution, and not necessarily Sumitomo Trust & Banking Corporation, which announced several months ago that it would merge with Long-Term Credit.
Another contentious issue has been the call by the opposition groups to eviscerate the financial policy-making powers of the influential Finance Ministry. In today's deal, the two sides agreed to draw up within the next 10 days or so a two-stage plan for the devolution of power. Negotiators were apparently still hashing out the measures and offered few details.
Still, a special committee will be formed, reporting directly to the Prime Minister, and over time, much of the powers from the Finance Ministry would be transferred to an expanded version of this committee.

HEADLINE: For Many Foreign Students, American Colleges Cost Too Much

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
American colleges and universities, long the world leaders in attracting foreign students, are seeing the decline of their dominance, Government analysts and education officials reported on Thursday at a conference in Washington.
Moving vigorously into the competition for international students are Australia, Canada, Latin America, New Zealand and members of the European Union, according to the Institute of International Education, which makes an annual study of students who travel abroad. 
 "I won't say we've lost our competitive edge, but we can no longer take things for granted," said Joseph Duffey, director of the United States Information Agency, which, with the Educational Testing Service, sponsored the conference.
The United States is still by far the most popular destination for foreign students, attracting about 458,000 in the 1996-97 academic year, the U.S.I.A. said. Next was France, which draws about 170,000 foreign students every year, according to figures provided by Unesco.
The number of foreign students studying in the United States increased steadily after World War II, but has been flat since 1993, speakers at the conference said. But, as the number of students studying in other countries has risen, the United States' share has shrunk. Five years ago, about 40 percent of all international students studied in the United States. Today, only 32 percent come here, according to U.S.I.A. figures.
The decline was attributed to the relatively high cost of American colleges and universities and to vigorous recruiting in recent years by colleges in other countries.
Since 1990, for example, the number of international students attending Australian colleges and universities has increased tenfold.
Keith Geiger, director of academic programs for the U.S.I.A., said: "Australian universities are much cheaper than their counterparts in the United States, and they are a whole lot closer to home for people in Southeast Asia, which is the largest provider of international students."
The decline in the number of foreign students attending colleges and universities in the United States cannot be explained by the Asian economic crisis because it began to unfold five years ago; the Asian crisis began last year.
Stephen J. Trachtenberg, the president of George Washington University who participated in the conference, called the leveling off of foreign students in the United States "the sincerest form of flattery."
"What's happened," Mr. Trachtenberg said in an interview, "is that after many foreign students have earned degrees from American institutions they then use their knowledge and experience to establish similar institutions in their home countries."
The way to reverse the trend, Mr. Duffey said in an interview, is "to make our institutions more user-friendly, to explore things like joint-degree programs, to see if there aren't unnecessary barriers and to explore helpful partnerships with industry and philanthropy."
Participants agreed that the effect of Asia's economic crisis was only beginning to be felt.
Nine of the 10 countries sending the most students to the United States are Asian. Canada is the only non-Asian country on the list.
In the 1996-97 academic year, the institute said, Japan supplied the most foreign students, with 46,292. China was next with 42,503, followed by South Korea (37,130), India (30,641), Taiwan (30,487) and Canada (22,984). Others on the top-10 list are Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: BILLIONS UPON BILLIONS: A special report.;
Fault Lines of Risk Appear As Market Hero Stumbles

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Wall Street, often hard-nosed and cynical, was utterly dazzled by John W. Meriwether. He was viewed as a bond trader with a Midas touch, a mathematician of genius who found gold nuggets in markets where others saw only sand.
In the giddy 1980's, he presided over a team of bond traders who generated immense profits for Salomon Brothers with arcane strategies that were dubbed "rocket science." But in a world of sharp tongues and sharper elbows, Mr. Meriwether was softly self-possessed, inspiring confidence among equals and hero-worship among underlings. A brush with scandal, as the supervisor of a trader caught manipulating bids on Treasury securities in 1991, did little to tarnish his gleaming reputation. When he left the firm in February 1994, some of his best traders and two Nobel-laureate economists followed him into a celebrated exile in Greenwich, Conn. 
 There, with fishing breaks when the bluefish were running, Mr. Meriwether and his partners operated Long-Term Capital Management L.P., a largely unregulated investment pool for the wealthy known as a hedge fund. By early 1998, Mr. Meriwether's team had invested $90 billion, most of it borrowed from Wall Street bankers so confident of Mr. Meriwether's skills that a few had even sunk some of their personal wealth into his new fund.
And it was there, last week, that the glittering Meriwether image toppled from its Wall Street pedestal and shattered. A hastily assembled consortium of international banks and brokerage houses took possession of the faltering firm and pumped in $3.65 billion to prevent a disorderly collapse that could have panicked the credit markets and sent shock waves from small-town real estate offices to the halls of Government in Brazil. If the fund had been forced to liquidate its entire portfolio, its sales could have undermined the value of financial contracts worth as much as $1.25 trillion.
How one man, utterly unknown beyond his rarefied world, became such a potent source of instability in one of the deepest, richest markets in the world reveals how Wall Street can be seduced by outsized success and the trappings of genius. And while the last-minute rescue grew out of an emergency warning system that provides some comfort to the nation's financial markets, the march to the precipice reveals how little regulators, investors and even traders themselves understand the fault lines of risk buried in today's global financial landscape.
"It is too early to give the definitive answer to what the lessons are, but clearly firms have got to look at their exposure and leverage, and at what margins of safety they have in these transactions," said Peter Bakstansky, senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which provided the framework for the rescue. "And they must have a better sense of the risk analysis being done by their borrowers."
A top Wall Street executive briefed on the negotiations last week said he was clear about the lesson for his own firm: "We will never let our exposure to one counterparty get to these levels again -- never. He had gotten too big for the market. Everybody gave him too much money."
In a world where the concept of too much money is met with blank stares, John Meriwether was able to borrow heavily from more than a dozen financial institutions, each of which was largely unaware of how much he had borrowed from the others. Hedge funds are private partnerships that are not required to disclose their trading strategies, and that can take money only from institutions and wealthy individuals, on the theory that these sophisticated investors understand the above-average risks involved.
Mr. Meriwether's hedge fund was even more secretive than most, to prevent rivals from copying its strategy or from anticipating its next move. In essence, the fund placed bets that tiny deviations in the traditional relationships between the prices of various securities would eventually return to normal.
For example, the interest rate on corporate bonds is usually about one percentage point higher than on comparable Treasury bonds, reflecting the greater risk of lending to companies. If the gap, called the spread, widened to more than one percentage point, the Meriwether team could bet with confidence that the relationship would ultimately revert to normal. Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton, who shared a Nobel prize in economics, helped program powerful computers to recognize countless similar profit opportunities.
The profit on each of these trades was so small that the Meriwether fund had to make its money on volume. As one Solomon Brothers veteran described it, the fund was like a roulette player betting on red and doubling up its bets each time the wheel stopped on black. "A gambler with $1,000 will probably lose," he said. "A gambler with $1 billion will wind up owning the casino, because it is a mathematical certainty that red will come up eventually -- but you have to have enough chips to stay at the table until that happens."
Last week's rescue, in effect, keeps Long-Term Capital at the table, buying time in which its massive gamble might yet pay off.
One way the fund accumulated its chips was by borrowing at least $20 for each $1 in capital.
At the end of 1997, Mr. Meriwether had so many chips that he was giving some back. Investors who had joined the fund after February 1994 were handed $2.82 for every $1 they had invested, and were told very politely to go away. Original investors from outside the firm -- who considered themselves the lucky ones -- took out their profits but kept their original stakes in the fund. After all, the fund had posted profits of 43 percent in 1995 and 41 percent in 1996.
As a result, the fund, whose capital base started at $1.2 billion, including $100 million in general partners' money, was reduced to about $4.7 billion at the beginning of this year, from roughly $7 billion at its peak.
 
Storm Warning
An Eastern Wind Rakes Greenwich
The first gust of the approaching storm came in June. The fund was down 10 percent, its worst monthly loss ever. Early August was even worse. As the Russian financial markets and other emerging markets grew increasingly treacherous, investors sought the safety of Treasury securities, pushing up Treasury prices while most other bond prices fell. Unfortunately, this pattern was the opposite of the Meriwether team's bets, and its paper losses grew.
Around Aug. 15, Mr. Meriwether warned his investors and trading partners about the grim results. But with roughly $3.7 billion left in capital, the partners were still confident they could weather the storm, and many left on vacation.
Then came Friday, Aug. 21 -- a terrible day for the bond market as skittish buyers, dumping corporate bonds to buy Treasury bonds, sent Treasury rates to a 20-year low. Long-Term Capital's general partners rushed back to their Greenwich offices, working through the weekend and the following week to review their positions, which had dropped 40 percent that month.
They approached new investors. But when the stock market plummeted on Aug. 31, any hope for new money evaporated.
On Sept. 2, Mr. Meriwether invited existing investors to put in more money to help the fund stay the course. Again, there were some talks, but no cash.
Around this time, one key element of the Wall Street warning system was activated: Mr. Meriwether's clearing broker, the Bear Stearns Companies, intensified its scrutiny of the fund's trading activities.
Clearing brokers execute the trades of their client firms, and if one of those firms cannot deliver the cash or securities required to satisfy its obligations, the clearing broker must settle the trade with the opposite party. To reduce their own risk, such brokers require their clearing clients to keep funds on deposit as collateral, and they can limit trading. Bear Stearns did, and Long-Term Capital complied, people who were briefed on their relationship said.
Another part of the Wall Street warning system was tripped, too. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which monitors the key commercial banks that serve the Wall Street community, was questioning how much Mr. Meriwether owed to institutions under its supervision.
 
Distress Call
A Legendary Trader Reaches Out
On Friday, Sept. 18, what had been a deeply worrisome problem became a full-blown crisis. The triggering event is still shrouded in official silence, but several people with sideline seats say that Mr. Meriwether, the celebrated bond trader, was blindsided by an unraveling stock investment. As the prices of Ciena and Tellabs shares fell following the collapse of their merger, Long-Term Capital had to provide additional collateral to brokers who had lent it money to buy those shares. Federal regulations on such transactions leave no room to wiggle.
In any case, the $3.7 billion in capital that Long-Term Capital had in mid-August had dwindled by more than two-thirds. It had become clear to several top Wall Street executives that Mr. Meriwether needed fresh money or his firm would fail.
"And if this firm had to liquidate in distress, the ramifications for the global marketplace would be very negative," one senior Wall Street executive said. How negative? "No one felt they could even quantify it. That's one of the things that made it so scary."
No one knew exactly the magnitude of the fund's liabilities, not even Bear Stearns, in part because the fund used complex financial contracts, known as derivatives, whose value was difficult to assess. But the yawning fear was that the nascent recovery in the market for bonds -- from mortgage-backed securities that help underwrite home purchases to the sovereign debt of Brazil -- would be "stopped in its tracks and turn the other way" if Long-Term Capital failed.
Though early reports have credited the Fed with pulling together -- some say forcing -- the bailout, it seems to have begun on Sunday afternoon, when Jon S. Corzine, a senior partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company, talked with Peter R. Fisher, an executive vice president of the New York Fed who was monitoring the crisis in Greenwich, and with top executives at Merrill Lynch, UBS of Switzerland and J. P. Morgan. Some of the firms had lent money to the fund, while others were trading partners or investors.
Those calls helped knit together a group to solve the crisis: Mr. Corzine; David H. Komansky, chairman of Merrill Lynch & Company, and Herbert M. Allison Jr., Merrill's president; David Solo from UBS A.G. and Douglas A. Warner 3d, chairman of J. P. Morgan & Company.
At 7:30 on Tuesday morning, the core group decided to gather on neutral ground in a private dining room that Mr. Fisher made available at the New York Fed's headquarters a few blocks from Wall Street. At the same times, teams from the investment banks were dispatched to Greenwich "to look at the situation," one top-level Wall Street executive said.
That examination made it clear that the fund would not be able to cover its obligations if it were forced to hurriedly liquidate its positions.
At 7 p.m., sleek black limousines again converged on the Fed's headquarters. This time, the core group had invited six other banks and brokerage houses, including Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and the Travelers Group.
While the Fed officials encouraged the group to come together, how pivotal a role the Fed played in the rescue effort is the subject of considerable disagreement among the participants in the drama.
"The Fed just provided the forum," one senior Wall Street executive said. Some of the bankers, however, have complained privately that regulators were in fact pressuring them to rescue the fund.
The negotiations were difficult, but the executives finally agreed they had no alternative but to give Mr. Meriwether more money.
 
Help Arrives
Buying Time, But at a Price
At 10 A.M. Wednesday, senior officers of 16 banks and brokerage firms assembled in a Fed conference room. They waited for more than a half-hour for William J. McDonough, the president of the New York Fed, who had just returned from London. At 10:40, he came in to explain that Mr. Corzine of Goldman, Sachs might have found a buyer to come to Long-Term Capital's rescue.
"Everyone in the room knew" that the potential buyer was the celebrated investor Warren E. Buffett, said one senior executive who was briefed on the meeting. Mr. Buffett had stepped in to rescue Salomon Brothers in 1991, after the bond trading scandal that prompted Mr. Meriwether's departure, and his involvement would have injected instant confidence into the marketplace. When Mr. McDonough suggested a recess until 1 P.M., the executives left the Fed, no doubt with their fingers crossed.
When they returned, however, the Fed president announced that the potential buyer had balked. Mr. Komansky of Merrill Lynch then challenged the group: How much additional money would each firm contribute to keep the fund alive and forestall the crisis of confidence that its collapse could produce?
There were angry arguments and resentful speeches, reflecting the tensions the men faced. Each executive knew that if his firm seized its collateral from Long-Term Capital and fled, only a few of them would reach the exit before the roof fell in. Nevertheless, collective action was difficult for such natural competitors, even with the Fed's brooding oversight.
Bear Stearns insisted, successfully, that its risks as the fund's clearing broker should exempt it from further contributions. Executives from three foreign banks initially balked at contributing anything, provoking a lecture from a senior Wall Street executive. The trio huddled privately, and announced they would participate after all.
In the end, 14 firms committed $100 million to $350 million each. That they could do so on such short notice is one happy result of the long, fat years in the capital markets that preceded these last anxious months. That the rescue effort was organized so smoothly suggests, too, that a strong habit of informal cooperation and close consultation has been forged in past crises.
At most, the deal bought the fund some breathing room in which their bets may, just possibly, ripen into the extraordinary profits that tempted them into this risky territory in the first place. But the cost was high. The rescue was essentially an informal, high-speed bankruptcy reorganization that turned Long-Term Capital's creditors into its new owners, who will oversee every aspect of the restructured firm's existence.
When the rescue package was reported to Mr. Meriwether in Greenwich at around 7 p.m. on Wednesday, he gathered his exhausted partners in his office and explained the deal, as he understood it. The partners in the room, and those listening by telephone in Tokyo and London, were calm as their future took an unexpected and personally painful twist.
Honeymoons would be canceled, weddings postponed. Homes under construction might never be finished, and once-glittering reputations might be lost forever.
At the end of the week, Mr. Meriwether and his partners retained a sliver of equity in the firm that they built on genius and panache. Their 180 employees -- most of whom had invested each year's bonuses in the fund -- were left with little more than uncertain jobs.
But regulators and others are left pondering how a small band of traders could threaten the confidence that knits together the world's financial markets.

HEADLINE: Democrats Push New Theme Of 'Lost Way' Republicans

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Picking up where President Clinton left off on Friday, three past or future Presidential aspirants today attacked the Republican-led Congress for focusing on the White House scandal at the expense of passing a budget bill and other important legislation.
In speeches on the final day of the Democratic National Committee's fall meetings, Vice President Al Gore, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson all joined in what has emerged as a major Democratic Party theme with the midterm elections less than six weeks away. In the same way that Republicans have made impeachment of the President a force to energize their base, Democrats are using Republican demands for punishment as their own clarion call. 
 "There's a raw partisanship on Capitol Hill," Mr. Gore said in a reference to the House Judiciary Committee, which is making public reams of documents from the independent counsel's investigation of the President as its members weigh a vote on impeachment proceedings. "Whoever thought we would look back at the 'Contract on America' as the good old days?"
Mr. Gephardt referred to his colleagues as "the worst Congress that ever sat in the building down the street." And Mr. Jackson, in a 45-minute speech packed with Biblical references, conjured an image of low-wage workers building "a train, a midnight train to Georgia, and let's put Newt Gingrich on that train."
The three speakers were preaching to the choir, and the audience of several hundred Democratic faithful cheered each of them heartily.
But their combined themes provided more evidence that Democrats were building a campaign strategy of demonizing a Congress trying to demonize Mr. Clinton in hopes of spurring a higher Democratic turnout in November. The thrust of the strategy stems largely from recent polls showing a growing satisfaction with Mr. Clinton's job performance.
Republicans hold an 11-seat advantage in the House and a 5-seat advantage in the Senate. Democrats are bracing for results that would continue to leave them in the minority in the House and Senate, and perhaps by an even greater margin.
Before the call for impeachment had gained so much momentum, Democrats seemed content to keep the elections localized, stressing how Administration policies on education, the economy and the environment would help the average family.
They still make those arguments, as all three speakers did today. But with the scandal providing a vivid and divisive backdrop to the elections, they are selling the notion that Republican zeal is blocking progress. Many of those attending the session wore newly minted buttons that read, "Progress Over Partisanship," a phrase of Mr. Clinton's.
The President criticized Republicans on Friday for a lack of action on spending bills and other legislation, and accused the majority in Congress of "failing to meet its most basic governing responsibility."
Of all three speakers today, it was the usually more placid Mr. Gore who seemed to turn up the heat the most. Unlike his standard remarks that accentuate Administration policies, his speech was a full-bore repudiation of Republican ideas. He called the G.O.P.'s economic legislation "the recycled, reheated, rehashed Republican retronomics that drove this nation into a fiscal ditch."
And chiding the Republicans for a focus on the independent counsel's inquiry into the President, he said, "When we say health care for families, they say investigations; when we say protect the environment, they say investigations; when we say education, they say investigations."
Mr. Gephardt, a Presidential candidate in 1988 who is expected to challenge Mr. Gore for the party's Presidential nomination in 2000, warned that two more years of a Republican majority would result in "nothing but investigations and fishing expeditions." He also criticized Congress for accomplishing little but the renaming of Washington's National Airport after Ronald Reagan.
Mr. Jackson, who has run for President several times, said in his speech that he "has not decided to run the race for 2000, but I'm going to set the pace for 2000."
With that, he wove a familiar Jackson theme into his remarks.
"Don't leave the poor behind," he said. "Our moral obligation is to include all, and leave no American behind. That's the way to win."

HEADLINE: State Begins Complex Task Of Evaluating All Colleges

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
With its ratings of primary and secondary schools well established, the New York State Department of Education is embarking on an effort to assess the state's colleges and universities, both public and private.
As early as 2001, the state could issue its first report evaluating the performance of colleges. The format is yet to be worked out, and department officials are reluctant to speculate about specifics. But they say the wide range of institutions -- from research universities to community colleges and trade schools -- means that the report must be more complex than the school report cards, perhaps something more like the reports issued by U.S. News & World Report and the Princeton Review but somehow going beyond them. 
 "Certainly U.S. News & World Report has taken an opportunity, but my personal view is that the higher education community could do a better job," said Richard P. Mills, the State Education Commissioner. "The fact that their reports are so eagerly consumed by the public tells me there is a lot people do want to know."
The department is seeking an additional $400,000 in its budget to help pay for the evaluation efforts, which it plans to shape in the coming year with the help of educators in New York and nationally and with consultants.
In the next week or two, it will name a new higher education advisory council that will include about 20 college presidents, the chancellors of the state's two public university systems and other leaders from public and private institutions. The department hopes to use the council as a sounding board on higher education policy as well as on the new evaluation process.
And in February, the department plans to hold what it is calling a summit on higher education in New York City.
"Primary and secondary education are moving in the right direction now," said Carl Hayden, chancellor of the Board of Regents. "It is time to turn the focus to higher education and to really bring the discussion of higher education issues to the fore."
He said the board had already taken aggressive steps in higher education, including its removal of Adelphi University's trustees and the imposition of new teacher education standards, and now planned to move even more broadly.
Measuring the quality of New York's diverse higher education institutions -- 260 degree-granting colleges and universities and 260 other postsecondary institutions -- is something Mr. Mills and the Regents have wanted to do for some time.
Two years ago, Mr. Mills proposed a higher education report card that would have applied 41 performance indicators to colleges, measurements like graduate employment rates, changes in tuition and the proportion of students needing remedial education. But he was criticized for proposing a "one-size-fits-all" approach, and it was put on hold.
"My sense is that it wasn't yet ripe," Mr. Mills said last week.
This time, he is trying to remedy that problem by recognizing the differences and inviting college leaders to help him and the Regents devise ways that take them into account while judging the performance of institutions with widely differing missions -- from a community college like Hostos, for example, to a graduate research university like Rockefeller University.
Gerald W. Patton, the Deputy Commissioner for Higher Education and the official charged with leading the assessment effort, said he expected that some criteria, like graduation rates and graduates' scores on licensing exams, would be applied to all or most institutions. But he said he expected colleges to define their special goals and to figure out ways to measure whether they are meeting them. "It does require faculty to talk more about their goals and objectives," Mr. Patton said. "We aren't trying to tell them how to do it. We want them to develop the methodologies."
He said he hoped that a framework would be in place by next year and that assessments would begin by 2000. Any proposals will be subject to public discussion and approval by the Regents.
While many states are trying to make their universities more accountable, the New York effort is more ambitious than most.
For one thing, unlike most state boards, the Board of Regents has jurisdiction over all higher education in the state, including its two Ivy League universities (Columbia and Cornell), religious institutions like St. John's and Fordham, and commercial colleges like DeVry Institute of Technology.
For another, many performance measurement systems have gotten bogged down in counting what is easy to count, like numbers of students and scores on tests.
Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, a nonprofit organization in Denver that advises state officials on education policy, called the effort a "complex undertaking" -- significantly more complicated than assessing high schools, which as a group have much more similar objectives.
"Most of the states that have struggled with this haven't done much once they have gotten past simpler measures to the more profound question of whether students are learning what they need to know to be effective citizens in the 21st century," he said.
Standards have become a mantra in education. Mr. Mills, who has an oversize set of alphabet blocks spelling "S-T-A-N-D-A-R-D-S" atop the tall bookcase behind his desk, has made an art of figuring out what they ought to be and then applying them.
He has laid out standards for his own performance as education commissioner. He has adopted the system of school report cards for rating primary and secondary schools in the state. And he is imposing strict new requirements for teacher education programs and teachers.
His plan to evaluate colleges, which has yet to be publicly announced, has drawn a mixed response. Some educators, like Mr. Newman of the Education Commission of the States, applauded it.
"For a long time in American higher education, we assumed quality, and that was a modestly reasonable assumption," he said. But those days are over, he added, because of the enormous change taking place in who is providing higher education, the new technologies being used, the broader range of students and the very different demands on graduates in the economy.
"All of a sudden, we can't make the simple assumptions we've all made that just because students have been through our educational process they are well educated," he said. "Seat time is not a good enough measure of quality any more."
But others question whether another layer of measurement will be worth the time and cost.
"I believe very strongly in accountability and in people's right to know," said Lois B. DeFleur, president of SUNY-Binghamton and chairwoman of the American Council on Education. "But we already devote unbelievable resources to the accrediting process and performance assessment and evaluation of our programs. They have to understand the cost in time and energy."
L. Jay Oliva, the president of New York University, offered a similar perspective. "There is no institution in the whole world that spends more time looking at itself than universities," he said.
Mr. Patton said he recognized the concerns, but added that he hoped colleges and universities would ultimately see the system as a benefit for them, too.
"It will be an avenue for them to do better," he said. "And it will send a message to the community at large about how higher education is improving."

HEADLINE: For Printers, an Eviction Notice;
Landlords Are Seeking Cleaner, High-Paying Tenants

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Harold Russell has to yell to be heard above the roar of the Miehle Roland presses churning out 25,000 brochures for an insurance company. The pungent smell of ink envelops the shop floor like a thick cloud.
Down the hallway, in Mr. Russell's office at 480 Canal Street, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, is the black skeleton of a 100-year-old Kelly letterpress and an oak time clock in which he punched his first timecard, at the age of 9. Earlier this month as he passed by the ancient clock, which runs 20 minutes slow, Mr. Russell, now 56, said he believed that time was finally running out for the printing industry in Manhattan. 
 Mr. Russell's landlord, Trinity Church, has put him and dozens of other printers on notice that the church will not renew their leases in its buildings in the 70-year-old printing district, near the Holland Tunnel. Other landlords are following suit, replacing printers who pay $10 a square foot with advertising agencies and other office tenants that will pay $25 to $30.
The current real estate boom, which has sent office tenants scurrying into industrial districts in search of cheaper rents, is threatening to wipe out what was once the second-largest manufacturing industry in the city. The printers say they will be forced to move to New Jersey, or even to close, if they cannot find industrial space close to their corporate clients, who want, in the words of Mr. Russell, to "sniff and touch" the sheets as they roll off the presses.
Even though commercial printing no longer accounts for one out of every seven factory jobs in the city, as it did during the 1920's, printers say the industry does provide skilled, relatively well-paid jobs and critical services for financial, advertising and entertainment companies.
"In the very short years to come, manufacturing will cease to exist in Manhattan," said Mr. Russell, president of the Skillcraft Group and a third-generation printer. "They want boutique shops. They say printers are dirty, so they don't want us. Between technological changes in the industry and real estate, we're really shoveling against the tide."
Trinity Church, at Broadway and Wall Street, is not the only landlord with printing tenants, but it is the largest in the printing district, which extends west from Avenue of the Americas to Hudson Street and north from Vestry Street to West Houston Street. Printers occupy about a sixth of the 15 buildings and 5.5 million square feet of space owned by the church. Trinity's decision to convert all but one of its remaining factory buildings to office space is forcing about 60 printers to hunt for new homes.
Stephen D. Heyman, director for leasing at Trinity Real Estate, said the church could no longer afford low rents and special deals for printers. These tenants, with their heavy presses and busy loading docks, will have to go, he said.
"The highest and best use for our portfolio is office space," Mr. Heyman said. "We decided to let the charitable work of the church be run by those who run charities. So we've been unwilling to renew or extend space to printers. You can't have a mixed-use building with printers. They're dirty. They make a lot of noise. The noise drives away a lot of people."
Other owners of buildings that house printers are also seeking quieter, more lucrative tenants.
In the garment district south of Times Square, office tenants are pushing their way in and pushing up rents, forcing out manufacturers. Some large printers like Tanagraphic own their buildings and are unaffected by the roiling real estate market. But most of the printers are family-owned businesses that lease space, and they say the expense of moving, which can run to several hundred thousand dollars or more, is a serious burden.
Roger P. Gimbel, president of Xerographic Reproduction Center, at 516 West 34th Street, said he wanted to expand his space to 50,000 square feet from 35,000, but his landlord, refused to even renew his lease. Mr. Gimbel's company is not an outmoded print shop; it is a computerized digital operation whose lifeblood is toner, rather than ink.
"The cost of picking up and moving is in excess of $1 million," Mr. Gimbel said. "We'd rather put that into equipment."
Downtown, Joseph Gitto, the president of Imtech, another digital printer whose clients are mainly investment banks, faces the same problem. He said his landlord at 130 Cedar Street, a longtime printers' building where he has rented 32,000 square feet for a decade, wanted him out, even before his lease expires in 2002.
New York has been hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs since the 1950's, and many of those jobs will probably never return. But urban planners and economic development specialists say the city needs to encourage manufacturers producing specialized, high-quality products with ties to local markets. These include computer software businesses, apparel makers that can produce goods quickly, and printers.
"In every major real estate cycle, there's somebody getting squeezed out of low-cost space in Manhattan," said Hugh O'Neil, president of Appleseed, an economic consulting company. "But the city's land use and development policies need to insure that some space remains available in Manhattan for blue-collar industries that support finance and business services, the media and the arts, or you could have the perverse effect of making Manhattan less attractive for those high-value activities."
Joseph P. Rose, chairman of the city's Planning Department, agreed, saying he had opposed efforts by landlords and speculators seeking zoning changes to convert industrial buildings to apartment houses in active manufacturing areas in Manhattan. But there is little he can do to stop the transformation of the printing district, he said.
"Clearly it's in the city's interest to retain manufacturing jobs," he said. "But there's no prohibition on the conversion of manufacturing space to office space."
About two dozen printers have banded together with the Association of Graphic Communications, a trade association representing 540 companies in and around New York City, to hire a real estate broker to find a building or buildings in Manhattan that could serve as a new center for printers, binders and engravers. William A. Dirzulaitis, president of the association, said the group had talked with city and state officials about getting help with moving expenses and electricity costs.
"The Mayor has been good when it comes to helping the commodity exchange, Conde Nast and the Yankees," Mr. Dirzulaitis said. "Here's a whole industry segment that could be lost if something isn't brought to the table."
Many printers are wary of alternative sites recommended by the city, like the Brooklyn Army Terminal or Long Island City in Queens, because they are hard to reach by truck or by public transportation. Trinity has set aside space for printers at 200 Hudson Street, but Michael Geoghegan, a broker at Insignia/Edward S. Gordon who is working for the printers, said there was little room left there.
Instead of celebrating the 75th anniversary of the company their grandfather started, Larry and Arthur Paladino, the owners of Palographia, one of the largest engravers in the city, at 175 Varick Street, are desperately looking for space in Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey City. Their landlord has refused to renew their lease.
"A lot of small printers like myself are going to get wiped out," Larry Paladino said.
Printers began moving to Hudson and Varick Streets in the 1920's to escape the congestion in lower Manhattan and to be closer to the Holland Tunnel, then under construction. At the time, nearly a quarter of all the commercial printing in the country was done in New York.
Trinity Church, which had owned a large piece of Manhattan under a 1705 land grant from Queen Anne of England, ended up with many of the factory buildings during the Depression. By the start of this century, the church had already disposed of much of its property, by either selling it or giving it to Columbia University. The church leased some of the land it kept to developers who built printing factories. And when the economy collapsed and the developers defaulted on their mortgages, the church bought the buildings.
Ever since, Trinity and the printing industry have been buffeted by technological change and the vagaries of the economy. In the 1980's, Mr. Heyman said, companies leasing 3 million of the church's 5.5 million square feet of real estate failed. Like many landlords, Mr. Heyman said, Trinity cut rents to help printers survive.
The church also has sought to gentrify the neighborhood, and named it Hudson Square. In the 1980's, Trinity leased land to Tishman Speyer, which built 375 Hudson Street, home to Saatchi & Saatchi DFS, an advertising agency. Later, Della Femina, McNamee WCRS moved into another Trinity property, 350 Hudson Street. Chic restaurants like the Buddha Bar, Hudson Grill and Triplets replaced printers' hangouts like Renato's on Vandam and the Printer's Pub at 480 Canal Street.
Now, Mr. Heyman said, Trinity is pouring money into transforming its largest building, 75 Varick Street, into 1 Hudson Square, enlarging the lobby, converting freight elevators to passenger use and installing a new air conditioning system. At 480 Canal Street, Trinity has already leased part of the building to a caterer.
Robert Mastellone, president of D & L Offset Lithography, is particularly incensed by the conversion at 75 Varick Street. Ten years ago, he spent about $1.5 million moving his company there from Trinity's building at 100 Avenue of the Americas. "We were told at the time that they had no plans to turn this building over to office space," Mr. Mastellone said. "We tried to get something in writing, but they said they could not do that."
Earlier this month, Alice Langon and her sons moved their engraving operation, I. Scheff, to West Babylon, N.Y., after 70 years at 480 Canal Street. George Linder, president of Linder & Company, another small printer at 480 Canal, has decided to go to Jersey City.
But most printers worry that they will lose many customers by leaving Manhattan. Given the boom-and-bust nature of real estate, they say Trinity is being short-sighted in ousting its longtime tenants.
"We're just getting clobbered," said William Abrams, vice president of AGW Lithographers at 225 Varick Street, a Trinity-owned building near Houston Street. "When this building was half empty, we still were paying our rent in a timely fashion. All of a sudden we're not good tenants. The market will face another downturn and we'll probably look like good tenants again."

HEADLINE: SPLINTERED HOUSE APPROVES TAX CUT WORTH $80 BILLION

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Brushing aside a veto threat from President Clinton, the House passed an $80 billion Republican tax cut today that would be paid for by projected Federal budget surpluses.
The vote put Republicans a step closer to a politically charged election-year showdown with the White House and Congressional Democrats over an issue that both sides believe will play to their advantage. 
 Republicans said a portion of the excess revenue expected to flow to the Government in coming years should be returned to taxpayers, in part to keep Washington from spending it.
Led by Mr. Clinton, Democrats have framed the issue as one of fiscal responsibility, saying that to spend any surpluses before they materialize would be reckless and endanger efforts to address the Social Security system's long-term financial problems. Since January, Mr. Clinton has been demanding that Congress set aside every penny of the surplus until it has agreed with the Administration on a plan to shore up Social Security.
The bill, which would save taxpayers $80 billion over five years, would provide a tax break for many middle-income married couples, exempt some interest and dividend payments from taxation, reduce inheritance taxes, accelerate a plan to allow the self-employed to deduct 100 percent of their health insurance premiums and extend a credit for research undertaken by corporations.
Today's House vote, 229 to 195, was largely along party lines. Eleven Republicans voted against the bill and 19 Democrats voted for it.
The legislation now goes to the Senate, where its prospects are uncertain. Because of the parliamentary rules that will apply to the bill in the Senate, it will require 60 votes for passage, a hurdle that Republicans, who hold 55 seats, said would be difficult to overcome.
Senate Republicans, who earlier this year voted to cut taxes $30 billion over five years, could scale back the House bill to try to win votes from wavering Democrats, although no decision has yet been made. Some Republicans have also weighed attaching the tax bill to a package of spending bills to make it more difficult for Democrats to vote against it and to raise the stakes should it come to a Presidential veto.
Battered and strained by Mr. Clinton's struggle for political survival, Democrats were clearly happy to turn their attention to an issue that could help unify the party and spur more Democrats to turn out at the polls in November.
Mr. Clinton, traveling in California, immediately put out a statement saying that the Republican plan "drains billions of dollars from the surplus before we have done the hard work of strengthening Social Security." The President reiterated that he would veto the bill if it reached his desk.
Republicans said the tax burden on citizens, measured as a percentage of total economic activity, was at its highest level since World War II. They said that cutting taxes would help move power out of Washington and back to states and communities while reining in Washington's predilection for ever-larger spending on social programs.
Mr. Clinton has already broken his own pledge to put Social Security first by proposing to use the surplus to pay for emergency spending next year for farm relief, increased security at American embassies and the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, Republicans said. Moreover, they said, the projected Federal budget surpluses are so large that there is plenty of room for a tax cut without limiting the options for dealing with the looming crisis in Social Security, which will run short of money to pay benefits when the baby-boom generation retires over the next three decades.
They said their plan would leave most of the surplus free to help address Social Security's looming difficulties. The surplus is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to be $520 billion over the next five years and $1.55 trillion over the next 10 years.
"The time has come to admit tax-and-spend has failed," said Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who wrote the tax bill. "It's time to reduce the size of Government and to let people keep their tax dollars."
But most Democrats stuck closely to their party line that now is not the time for tax cuts. They said that all the projected surplus for the next five years, and nearly all for the next decade, will come from excess payroll tax payments that are earmarked for Social Security's trust funds.
Once the Social Security surplus is stripped out of the overall surplus calculations, the Democrats said, there is nothing left to pay for a tax cut, making the Republican plan a threat to the nation's long-term fiscal health.
"The passage of this bill will make solving the Social Security problem more difficult, plain and simple," said Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland. "We're raiding Social Security. Without Social Security we have no surplus."
The issue is already showing up in Congressional races around the country. The A.F.L.-C.I.O., a major source of support for Democrats as they struggle to keep Republicans from picking up more seats in the wake of Mr. Clinton's troubles, said it began running television commercials in 20 Congressional districts this week trying to rally support against the tax cuts.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said the message from Republicans was that the "election is more important to the Republican Party than saving Social Security for future generations."
Republicans said Democrats were relying on scare tactics. "Social Security will be protected," said Representative Sam Johnson, a Texas Republican.
Although the bill has provisions to benefit big business and the wealthy, its was written by Republicans to appeal to the middle class, and many Democrats said they would have supported it if it did not require dipping into the surplus. The cuts would be worth about $80 billion over five years and $177 billion over 10 years.
Republicans "have hijacked Democratic tax cut ideas and then made it impossible for us to vote for them because their bill drains the Social Security trust fund," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York.
The bill's centerpiece is a reduction in the so-called marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that causes many two-income couples to pay a bigger tax bill than they would if single.
The penalty primarily affects couples in which the two partners have roughly equal incomes. But the bill would provide a break to all couples who file jointly and claim the standard deduction by increasing the standard deduction for couples filing jointly so that it is double the deduction for single filers.
The second-biggest provision in the bill would be an acceleration of a planned reduction in the estate tax, a change that would benefit the heirs of individuals who have amassed considerable wealth. The provision would increase to $1 million from $600,000 the amount that can be exempted from Federal estate taxes, starting Jan. 1, 1999.
The bill would also exempt from taxation the first $400 in interest and dividend income for couples filing jointly, or the first $200 for single filers.

Still a Good Day for Sosa As Cubs Avoid Disaster

BYLINE: By BILL DEDMAN

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The moment was ready to be pasted into the Scrapbook of Frustration, the one kept on the shelf of memory by Chicago Cubs fans everywhere.
The day began with the Cubs in a three-way tie with the Mets and Giants for the last spot in the playoffs, and with the Cubs' Sammy Sosa tied with Mark McGwire in the home run chase. On the scoreboard, the Cubs could see that the Giants had beaten the Rockies, and the video screen showed that McGwire had hit two home runs, pulling two ahead of Sosa. And now the Cubs, who had rallied when Sosa scored the go-ahead run in the eighth, were blowing another lead. 
 Then, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, in the next-to-last game of the regular season, with the Cubs leading by 3-2 and the tying run on third base, Dave Clark of the Astros rolled a little nubber up the first base line. Pitcher Rod Beck gloved the ball, swiped a tag at the batter and heard no one call "Out!" So he threw the ball toward first. It hit Clark squarely in the back and rolled away as a runner crossed home plate.
The 51,950 fans in the Astrodome knew the game was tied, and the groans of Cubs fans could be heard all the way from Chicago. The day that began with a three-way tie in the National League wild-card race would surely end, it seemed, with the Cubs and the Mets trailing the Giants by one game. And, as has happened as regularly as Halloween since 1945, the Cubs' October would not include a World Series.
But there was the mighty figure of Umpire Eric Gregg, pointing at Clark, calling him out for running outside the baseline to avoid the tag. The game was over. The jubilant Cubs had won, 3-2.
The day ended with the surging Giants and struggling Cubs a game ahead of the fading Mets, with only one game to play. The Mets lost in Atlanta, 4-0, and the Giants won in Denver, 8-4.
The Cubs were carried by heroes familiar and unlikely.
Sosa, who started the game-winning rally with a simple single to left field, finished the day 2 for 4, adding to his resume for most valuable player in the league.
Gary Gaetti, who was unemployed when the Cubs hired him in August on his 40th birthday, hit two doubles, one that helped the Cubs tie the game and the other to win it. He may be the Cubs' most valuable player for September, hitting .328 since he joined the team.
With their season reduced to two games, the Cubs won the first one with one arm tied behind their backs: Kerry Wood's.
The rookie phenomenon with the sore elbow sat on the bench, filing his nails, during this afternoon's game against the first-place Astros, 20 of whom he struck out in a single game back in May. Wood will sit out the Sunday afternoon game as well. He has thrown without pain in practice, but the Cubs say they will not risk a 20-year-old's career, even for a chance at the World Series. "We don't want him to hurt himself," Cubs Manager Jim Riggleman said.
Wood filed his nails harder as Sosa struck out in the sixth inning, leaving the Cubs behind, 1-0.
Wood started to chew on his nails in the seventh, when the Cubs tied the game on a double by Gaetti, a wild pitch, and a sacrifice fly by Orlando Merced. Neither player was a Cub until the past month.
Wood stopped chewing in the eighth, when the Cubs took the lead on a single to left by Sosa, a single to right by Mark Grace, and another double by Gaetti.
Then Wood nearly chewed up to his sore elbow in the ninth. The angst was induced by Beck, who has gained a reputation as a Houdini who throws himself overboard in chains, sometimes forgetting the key. Beck gave up a home run by Jeff Bagwell that gave the Cubs a 3-2 lead, then he allowed the tying run to reach third on a Moises Alou double and a groundout. Then came the slow roller to first.
"I know people don't think I know what I'm doing out there," Beck said in the loose and confident Cubs clubhouse after the game, "but I really do. Honest. I have 50 saves."
The Astros did not think much of Gregg's final call. "They blew it," Astros Manager Larry Dierker said.
The Cubs were saved today by their starting pitcher, Mark Clark, who hails from Bath, Ill., which is a Central Illinois border town. It's on two borders, actually, the one between Cardinals and Cubs fans and between McGwire and Sosa fans.
With a $5 million salary, Mark Clark is the highest-paid player on the Cubs after Sosa, who makes $8 million. Clark has been the least consistent member of the Cubs' starting rotation, with a 4-6 record since the All-Star Game break.
Clark was nearly removed after only five batters, when Houston took a 1-0 lead and loaded the bases. But he got out of the jam and allowed only five hits in eight innings. He was nearly matched by Shane Reynolds, who failed to win his 20th game, leaving with the game tied 1-1 in the eighth. Clark is now 9-14. Jay Powell was the loser, now 7-7.
A questionable left arm starts for the Cubs on Sunday. Terry Mulholland, the nonstarting starter, is scheduled to face Mike Hampton. The Cubs paid the veteran Mulholland $600,000 for the year, plus healthy contract incentives for successful starts, then kept him out of the rotation. Mulholland, a World Series veteran with the Phillies, gave the Cubs two terrific starts recently in Wood's place, made all the more remarkable because Mulholland's father is very ill. The 35-year-old won games on the road this month in San Diego and Milwaukee, giving up a combined three earned runs.
"Terry's pitched in the big dance a couple of times," Beck said. "He handles pressure better than anybody."
The starting pitcher for the Cubs in a playoff would be Steve Trachsel, who is 14-8 but has been pummeled in three starts since he gave up McGwire's record-breaking 62d home run in St. Louis on Sept. 8.
"We like our chances," Sosa said. "The home runs didn't come, but we got the win. That's what counts. I've always been saying that Mark is going to finish ahead of me."

Poverty Rates Fall

 BODY:
In a welcome bit of good news for the Clinton Administration, the Census Bureau reported that the proportion of Americans living in poverty declined last year, a drop largely attributed to progress made by black and Hispanic families. 
 The overall rate was 13.3 percent in 1997, down from 13.7 percent the year before. Mr. Clinton said the statistics vindicated his economic policies.

Reading Tea Leaves

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan and Keizo Obuchi have almost nothing in common. Except that the Federal Reserve chairman and the new Japanese Prime Minister both enjoy reputations for making public comments that leave investors puzzled.
What investors heard from Mr. Greenspan last week was a slippery statement that, "We have to bring the existing instabilities to a level of stability reasonably shortly" before the global economic turmoil really rocks America. The world immediately assumed that the Fed will cut interest rates on Tuesday. 
 Then there was Mr. Obuchi. Before meeting President Clinton in New York to discuss Japan's banking crisis, he said, "Instead of 'too little too late' we want to deal with this in ways that people say 'too big, too fast.' "
Even President Clinton's economic team had a hard time faking much optimism at those words. "You have to remember, we've been in office six years and we've already met six Japanese Prime Ministers," one noted.

NASA Seeks a Russian Bailout

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
The biggest science project of all time, a sprawling outpost for astronauts, is to start being hauled piecemeal into orbit in two months. But the plan is shaky because a key Russian player has been crippled by the nation's economic chaos.
So NASA plans to buy up to $660 million in goods and services over five years to help its partner complete a key station element. Congress hates the plan. But the alternatives -- including dropping the station, on which the Americans have already spent billions -- are unappealing.

HEADLINE: The I.M.F. Can Calm a Roiling Global Economy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
While American officials were narrowly focused on the irrelevant question of whether to raise or lower interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point and how to get Congress to finance the International Monetary Fund with an additional inadequate $18 billion, Japan is making recommendations of world-class magnitude (front page, Sept. 21). 
 Instead of ignoring Japan's suggestions or putting it down for having the audacity to make them, United States officials should seize on them and put them together into one plan to tackle all the world's economic trouble spots at once: the $100 billion suggested by Japan for Asia should be increased to $200 billion for the world; the leaders of the industrialized countries should be combined with the other world leaders to discuss the instability of Asia, the Russian crisis and global economic risks.

HEADLINE: For New York City, Garbage Is a Resource

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I applaud your call for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to expand weekly recycling pickups to the entire city (editorial, Sept. 21). However, you err when you refer to recyclable materials as "garbage." Old newspapers and rinsed-out tuna cans are not garbage but resources. 
 This distinction is important because the real savings from recycling come not from reducing the loads sent to landfills but from lower energy costs. It takes a lot less energy to prepare recycled glass, plastic, metal and paper for remanufacturing than it does to extract, transport and refine the raw materials.
For these lower energy costs to be realized, however, requires that a critical mass of recyclable materials be consistently available. New York City's sheer size gives us an unparalleled advantage in creating such a reliable market. A few much smaller, more spread-out municipalities have already begun to succeed in doing so, yielding lasting competitive advantage to their local and regional economies.

Forbes: Not Loved In Arizona Anymore?

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.

 BODY:
Back during the 1996 Presidential campaign, Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate, spent the better part of $4 million, much of it from his personal fortune, to win a surprise victory in Arizona's Republican primary. Since then, his eye now fixed on the Election 2000 primary, he has returned often to the Grand Canyon State to meet and greet and to preach his special brand of conservative economics. 
 Just a few days ago he spoke at a fund-raiser for a fellow Republican, Representative J. D. Hayworth, who is running for a second term in Arizona's Sixth Congressional District. And in another week or so, he is scheduled to be the keynote speaker at the annual fund-raising dinner of the Arizona Christian Coalition, a major force in the state's politics.
Is he making any political progress? Maybe not, if a newly released Presidential preference poll is to be believed.
Taken late last month by Arizona Chamber Info, a subsidiary of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, it asked 231 registered Republicans to pick a favorite from a list of party members who have indicated that they might run in 2000. Topping the list were Jack Kemp, the 1996 Vice Presidential candidate, with about 18 percent, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, 14. Among bottom dwellers were Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, with 2, and Mr. Forbes and Lamar Alexander, the former Governor of Tennessee, each with 0.
How soon they forget . . .
Not so, Mr. Forbes counters. He slammed the survey as "preposterous fiction" and "random selection that just doesn't cut it."
In fact, a sampling of just 231 voters is on the thin side, as political polls go. Nevertheless, chamber officials defend the accuracy of their survey, calculating its margin of error to be plus or minus about 5 percentage points.
Since 52 percent of the respondents were undecided this early in the run-up to Election 2000, the chamber officials added, there is plenty of time and room for Mr. Forbes to improve and make another good showing.
On the other hand, maybe Mr. Forbes should forget about Arizona and concentrate more on another state he has also been working hard -- Iowa, quadrennial home of the first Presidential caucuses.
In a new Mason-Dixon poll of likely G.O.P. caucus-goers, Mr. Forbes and Governor Bush ended up in a dead heat, with the rest of the wannabe field lagging badly, most notably Mr. Alexander, who has spent more time trodding the Election 2000 trail that just about anybody. In Iowa a mere 2 percent of poll respondents picked him as their favorite.

From the Ashes of the Old
 American Labor and
 America's Future.
 By Stanley Aronowitz.
 246 pp. Boston:
 Houghton Mifflin Company. $25. 
 From the late 1970's to the mid-1990's, the American labor movement largely drifted into irrelevance, doing little to shape public policy and even less to reverse its decline in membership. Now, as it begins to throw its weight around once again, Stanley Aronowitz, in "From the Ashes of the Old," has catalogued the many mistakes labor made to become so marginalized. He also provides a prescription, part sound advice, part pie in the sky, for how it can once again become powerful.
In an era when big money dominates politics, when giant corporations control much of the economy and the national discourse, and when the divide between haves and have-nots grows ever wider, Aronowitz, a former factory worker and now a sociology professor at the City University of New York, sees a revived labor movement as the best antidote to all these developments. "That we have growing inequality in America -- income differences are greater than in any advanced industrial society -- may be ascribed mainly to the erosion of trade union power," he writes.
In analyzing labor's decline, Aronowitz describes how unions long devoted themselves more to catering to well-heeled workers in steel and automobiles than to helping those most in need, like farm workers and hotel housekeepers. He attacks the many union leaders who became petty, bureaucratic dictators, preoccupied with preserving their positions and perks. Most of all, he denounces "business unionism," in which union officials focused on negotiating contracts and processing members' grievances, while ignoring labor's traditional calling of organizing the unorganized.
The bulk of the book consists of recommendations on how to put more movement back into the union movement. Aronowitz calls on labor to organize those workers on the lowest rung. And he urges it to build a broad social coalition, tied to the civil rights and women's movements.
To swell its ranks, Aronowitz says, labor must organize millions of workers in the South, even though both employers and employees there have been especially resistant to unionization. He also calls for recruiting the many disgruntled white-collar workers and professionals who are being squeezed, downsized and pushed around by management.
Aronowitz acknowledges that John J. Sweeney has begun taking many of these steps since assuming the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s helm nearly three years ago. His message to Sweeney is simply: move farther faster.
Many times, Aronowitz cavalierly offers recommendations without addressing the huge obstacles to implementing them. Labor leaders, he writes, should refuse to grant major concessions in contract bargaining, as though corporations would suddenly roll over. He urges unions to demand a shorter workweek without addressing why, in an era of galloping globalization, this would not push up labor costs and perhaps push jobs overseas.
Written in a dry, sometimes academic tone, "From the Ashes of the Old" appears aimed not at rank-and-file workers but at politicians, union leaders and intellectuals. The book contains an impressive in-depth look at the workings and strategies of more than a dozen unions. Aronowitz might have made his arguments more persuasive by including some human voices and stories to personify the unhappy trends he describes -- workers struggling to survive on the minimum wage, for example.
In one of his few poignant passages, Aronowitz all too briefly tells how unions helped his father, a garment worker, and his mother, an office clerk. Proud that he has inherited their pro-union legacy, Aronowitz comes across as part of a dying breed: a member of the working class turned intellectual romantic. For him, labor's flame, though dimmed, can still someday burn brightly -- especially if union officialdom takes his advice to heart.

 UNDER A WING
 A Memoir.
 By Reeve Lindbergh.
 Illustrated. 223 pp. New York:
 Simon & Schuster. $23. 
 Charles Lindbergh's one-man flight from New York to Paris in 1927 made him the most admired man on earth, and the kidnapping and death of his firstborn son won him the world's sympathy in 1932. But after Pearl Harbor, memories of his obdurate opposition to American intervention in the war against Hitler caused millions to see him as a Nazi sympathizer, a defeatist, perhaps even a traitor. "Imagine," his sister-in-law wrote, "in just 15 years he had gone from Jesus to Judas." The early war years proved to be the low point in his career's remarkable trajectory. He refused ever to recant his conviction that America had been wrong to go to war, but he demonstrated his patriotism by helping evaluate new aircraft and, although a civilian, volunteering to fly combat missions in the South Pacific; he then went on to write an account of his Paris flight that won him a Pulitzer Prize and to become one of history's most tireless -- and effective -- conservationists. Through it all, he remained taciturn, aloof, without apparent emotion -- a puzzle to the best of his biographers and something of a mystery even to his own children.
In "Lindbergh," A. Scott Berg brings us about as close as I suspect we will ever get to the man himself. The first biographer to be granted unfettered access to Lindbergh's private papers, Berg provides enough fresh detail to trace the roots of Lindbergh's personality, its strengths as well as its maddening flaws, all the way back to his turbulent boyhood, a period so painful to him that as an adult he once admitted, "I have no recollection whatever of my daily routine during the early years of my life."
Little wonder: He was an only child trapped between estranged, eccentric parents whose affection for him was more than matched by their loathing for each other. His father and namesake was a singularly independent-minded Swedish-born Congressman who destroyed his career by doggedly continuing to attack America's entry into World War I long after even his Minnesota constituents had mobilized to crush the Hun. He inculcated in his son both his stoicism -- the younger Lindbergh liked to boast that his father had once endured surgery to repair a hernia without anesthesia -- and his studied disregard for the opinions of others: "You and I can take hard knocks," the old man told his son. "We'll get along no matter what happens." It was his father's example, Berg writes, that convinced Lindbergh that "greatness came at the inevitable price of being misunderstood."
The boy was proud of his father but he spent most of his time in the bizarre company of a mother so noisy that members of her husband's family called her "the Anvil Chorus," and so hot-tempered and self-dramatizing that she once held a revolver to her husband's head and may have failed to pull the trigger only because her weary target told her to go ahead and shoot. Young Charles had little time to be a boy. He and his mother moved nearly every year -- he attended at least 10 schools by the age of 18, did poorly at all of them and made lasting friends at none. Instead, he was expected to act as his mother's confidant and caretaker, serving as her chauffeur from the age of 11, running the family farm for her while trying to finish high school and all the time struggling to stay at least one step ahead of her bewildering, perpetually shifting moods.
"Father . . . was ever on the alert for dangers, though the dangers were unspecified," Lindbergh's sixth and youngest child, Reeve, remembers in her wonderful family memoir, "Under a Wing." " 'It's the unforeseen . . .' he would warn us. 'It's always the unforeseen.' " All his life, Lindbergh would try to predict the unpredictable and to seek to impose his own absolute control over people and events. That compulsion served him superbly at 25 when planning his famous flight: he carried with him just five sandwiches, he explained, because "If I get to Paris I won't need any more, and if I don't get to Paris, I won't need any more, either."
But after that nothing would ever be the same. The larger world refused to bend to his will; time and again he would find himself undone by the unforeseen. Even after 45 difficult years of marriage, Anne Morrow Lindbergh could never read her husband's account of his landing at Paris without tears. "There is something," she confided to her diary, "in the directness -- simplicity -- innocence of that boy arriving after that terrific flight -- completely unaware of the world interest -- the wild crowds below. The rush of the crowds to the plane is symbolic of life rushing at him -- a new life -- new responsibilities -- he was completely unaware of and unprepared for."
Although she was the daughter of a wealthy diplomat, Anne Morrow was even more shy, more unprepared for fame, than the man whose life and responsibilities she shared from 1929 until his death. But when she surprised his latest biographer by opening her own papers to him as well as her late husband's, she sent him a remarkably clear-eyed note: "You can't write about Charles," she wrote Berg, "without writing about me." She was right: Her writings, filled with love for her husband but also with more knowledge of his faults than her previously published diaries would suggest, bring to this account of their lives together a remarkable intimacy and candor. "Lindbergh" is almost as much her biography as his.
The first crisis they faced together -- the death of their child, the appalling circus that surrounded his kidnapper's trial and execution -- also demonstrated the basic differences between man and wife. Anne Lindbergh was devastated. Her husband was never once seen to weep. Instead, he hurled himself again and again into the sky, to the West Coast, the Arctic Circle, Europe, seeking the escape he had always found in flight, the loss of "all conscious connection with the past" that had been precious to him ever since he'd first left the ground -- and his intrusive mother -- behind. Looking back, his wife would come to believe that his chronic restlessness resulted from a terror of facing his own emotions related to the unmourned loss of their son but reaching all the way back to childhood.
The kidnapping also drove the Lindberghs out of their country, first to England, then to a rocky private island off the northern coast of Brittany, in search of a place where they might be left alone. In 1936, the United States military attache in Berlin asked Lindbergh to come to Germany to assess Hitler's fast-growing air force. He was impressed by it -- and by what he called the "youth, hope and vigor in Germany today" as well. The democracies were "in decline," he believed, and of the "lies and insults of the press" in his own homeland, he wrote that "it takes the sweetness from the freedom of democracy and makes one wonder where freedom ends and disorder begins." In Nazi Germany, disorder was not a problem.
One of Anne Morrow's former teachers at Smith College privately dismissed Lindbergh early on as "really no more than a mechanic . . . had it not been for the lone eagle flight, he would now be in charge of a gasoline station on the outskirts of St. Louis." That was unfair. Lindbergh was a superb pilot, a skilled writer, an able laboratory researcher, whose work with Dr. Alexis Carrel helped produce an important precursor of the artificial heart, and an effective spokesman for whatever cause currently concerned him. But his mind was a muddle, a magpie's mix of science, eugenics, mysticism and apocalyptic visions. Race infused his thinking, too: aviation, he intoned in Reader's Digest in 1939, was "a gift from heaven . . . a tool specially shaped for Western hands . . . one of those priceless possessions which permit the White race to live at all in a pressing sea of Yellow, Black and Brown." Rather than go to war with Germany, America should join with her and England to form a mighty "Western Wall of race and arms which can hold back either a Genghis Khan or the infiltration of inferior blood."
Anne Lindbergh later confessed that she and her husband had both been "very blind, especially in the beginning, to the worst evils of the Nazi system." Her husband never retracted anything. But Berg discovered that when Lindbergh published his "Wartime Journals" in 1970 he did quietly try to tidy up the record. William Jovanovich claimed in the publisher's introduction that all the colonel's writings appeared precisely as written, save for references to persons still living and material that was either repetitious or "not important." Berg has found that much of the omitted material actually revealed Lindbergh's eerie attitudes toward Jews. Returning to America from Europe in 1939, for example, Lindbergh's ship passed through stormy seas. "The steward tells me that most of the Jewish passengers are sick," he wrote. "Imagine the United States taking these Jews in addition to those we already have. There are too many in places like New York already. A few Jews add strength and character to a country, but too many create chaos. And we are getting too many." Berg is admirably fair-minded -- he argues persuasively that his stubbornly misguided subject was never a Nazi, never a would-be dictator, as Franklin Roosevelt for one believed he was -- but when he writes that Lindbergh later, "not fully realizing" that comments like these were anti-Semitic, "intuitively deleted them," he is surely being too kind.
Reeve Lindbergh was born in 1945, and her memoir beautifully recaptures the determinedly ordered life her father insisted his family lead in their Connecticut home after the war. He was a loving, active father when he was home, she remembers, privately more demonstrative than her mother. But he was also severe: "Our lives," she writes, like the airplanes he flew, "were also monitored by checklists."His older daughter, Anne, remembered: "There were only two ways of doing things -- Father's way and the wrong way." He barred television and comic books and ice with 7-Up, and when his wife suggested she needed a new stove, he asked her to postpone the decision until they could talk over the purchase together "from personal, economic and military standpoints." No eventuality was too small -- or too unlikely -- to be overlooked when planning for the family's future: in case war broke out with the Soviets while he was away, his wife was to cancel the children's dental appointments since the enemy might poison the water supply. When his youngest son, Scott, rebelled against his strictures, Lindbergh neither spoke nor wrote to him for several years.
Anne Lindbergh's 1955 best seller, "Gift From the Sea," became a source of inspiration for a whole generation of wives and mothers -- "the great vacationless class," she called them -- who, like herself, were beginning to search for more fulfilling lives once their children had grown and moved away. As Berg shows for the first time, the book's poetic serenity came at a fearful price. Her husband's incessant comings and goings, his humorless efforts to direct her life and those of her children, his scorn for genuine emotion and impatience with her fragile sense of herself and her writing, all took their toll on her and on her marriage. She turned to psychiatry, sought solace in a brief affair and considered divorce before settling into a new kind of relationship, one in which she abandoned hope of slowing her husband down but also refused to conform to his every whim. Through it all, the Lindberghs somehow remained deeply in love with each other.
Nothing could stop Lindbergh's journeying -- but his mission changed with time. He led simulated bomber missions for the Strategic Air Command, promoted business for Pan American World Airways, championed the early space program. Then, in the mid-1960's, he abruptly changed course. Arguing that the aviation age he had helped usher in had done more harm than good, that the future of civilization now demanded the rescue of what little wilderness remained, he became a sort of one-man conservation commando corps, dropping from the skies wherever species were endangered or indigenous people found themselves threatened by change. In country after country, conservation laws were strengthened and wild places preserved because he had lent his name to their cause.
To the very end, Charles Lindbergh struggled against the unforeseen, fought to remain in full control. Dying from cancer in the summer of 1974, he insisted on being flown to Maui, the last and most remote of the several "perches" he had built for himself and which he expected his patient wife to oversee in his absence. There, surrounded by his family, he spent his last days meticulously planning his own burial. He picked the readings for his funeral, chose the inscription and the typeface for his tombstone, had his grave dug to precise specifications -- "Father was obsessed about drainage," his son Jon remembered -- and even saw to it that his death certificate was signed in advance. Every line was filled in except the date.

BYLINE: By Frank Bruni; Frank Bruni, a Times Metro reporter, wrote about Mary Bono for the magazine in March.

 BODY:
It starts the moment bill weld steps from the car and seems as if it will never stop: the craned necks, the raised thumbs, the exuberant hellos. As he makes his way into and then through Fenway Park, there is a new fan at every step, another outstretched hand at every turn. On this mid-July night in the heart of Boston, the approbation is as thick as the humidity. "Can I get a picture of you with my nephew?" asks one man, maneuvering the little boy into position.
Weld obliges with a hand around the boy's back, a well-practiced smile and a wry apology. "Sorry about the extra poundage," he quips, his free hand straying toward a belly that's only a tad larger than it used to be. There is another man who regales Weld with praise for his six and a half years as Governor of Massachusetts, another who vows eternal political allegiance to him, yet another who simply wants to chew the fat. 
 Finally, Weld reaches his destination: a swath of seats where more than a dozen colleagues from the blue-chip law firm where he now works are ensconced, frothy beers in hand, for a ties-off, wing-tips-unlaced outing. He takes his seat and looks toward home plate, a white speck, almost invisible from this remote section deep behind right field. Strangely, Weld has run a gantlet of adoration to end up far, far away from the action.
"Governor Weld," shouts a voice from three rows behind him, "what are you doing all the way back here?"
"These are the best seats I could get," Weld quips. "When you're out, you're out."
Just two years ago, Weld was very much in. He was a popular second-term Republican Governor in a heavily Democratic state. He had presided over, and certainly contributed to, the state's transition from economic bust to boom. Pundits touted his brand of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism as a New Age model, and Democratic peers emulated it. Journalists anointed him a Presidential possibility.
Then he made one of the most abrupt, astonishing U-turns in recent political history. Brashly tempting electoral fate, he challenged John Kerry, a popular Democratic incumbent, for one of Massachusetts' two seats in the U.S. Senate. It was a questionable decision, ending in defeat, that Weld followed with another, more quixotic quest: to become the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, a post that Jesse Helms, the ultraconservative Republican chairman of the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, almost immediately vowed to deny him. Weld left office to devote himself to the fight for confirmation. Once again, he lost.
Now comes another surprise, of an entirely different sort. This month, Simon & Schuster published Weld's first novel, "Mackerel by Moonlight," a political, picaresque tale seasoned generously with his trademark droll humor. Although Weld is not the first politician to try his hand at fiction, the book remains an unusual endeavor, the latest curve ball in a career that has recently been rife with them.
And it draws renewed attention to a question that has perplexed observers for some time now: How did William F. Weld, 53, a onetime golden boy, get from there to here? One of the most frequently offered answers has to do with Weld's status as a pro-choice, gay-friendly libertarian in a Republican Party that does not easily accommodate such thinking. Or, Weld's exile is chalked up to a few bad decisions.
But the truth is more complicated, and has at least as much to do with who Weld is on the inside as the world outside him. As reflected in both the substance and tone of "Mackerel by Moonlight," which is more "Primary Colors" than "Profiles in Courage," this is a man who has always favored irony over earnestness, who seems at least as interested in private amusement as in public service and whose itchy mind demands new adventures in rapid succession. This is a man, in other words, almost spectacularly ill suited to the stratagems, tedium and patience required for sustained political glory.
"Bill Weld is a guy who likes the bold stroke," says Ray Howell, who worked on Weld's gubernatorial campaigns. "He likes to throw the Hail Mary pass. Grinding it out is not something that appeals to him. Unfortunately, I think grinding it out is often the successful route for elective politics."
"Mackerel by Moonlight" introduces Terry Mullally, who is both like and unlike Weld. While Weld grew up on 600 acres on Long Island and followed his forebears' leather-soled footsteps to Harvard, Mullally comes of age in Brooklyn and gets his degree from a city university. Like Weld, Mullally first makes his name tackling corruption as a Federal prosecutor and ends up in Boston. Unlike Weld, he is a Democrat, and the elective office he seeks is district attorney.
As the novel tracks Mullally's meteoric rise and all the debris that falls to earth along the way, it eventually becomes a whodunit about two mysterious deaths. The title alludes to a pungent put-down of a successful politician, and of politics itself. Like a rotting mackerel in the moonlight, the saying goes, it shines and it stinks.
Jaunty and clever, the book nonetheless seems the byproduct less of Weld's literary talents than of his name recognition, a more respectable relative of "Embrace the Serpent," the bizarrely titled and quizzically received international thriller co-written by Marilyn Quayle, and "Murder at City Hall," a mystery co-written by Ed Koch that also left many critics scratching their heads, if not holding their noses. It underlines the way in which political celebrity seems to be a flexible currency that puts Susan Molinari in the anchor chair of a TV news program and Donna Shalala in milk advertisements.
But "Mackerel by Moonlight" is most interesting for what it says about Weld himself. He began writing it in January 1997, shortly after his failed Senate bid, when he was still Governor and, according to friends, beset less by disappointment than by disinterest in the familiar tasks at hand. His account of its genesis and rapid completion betrays not only his quicksilver mind but also his elite cultural bearings, intellectual vanity and "look, Ma, no hands" style.
He says the book was born one night as he sat in front of a blazing fire in his three-story, seven-bedroom house in Cambridge, reading a description of the way F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote "The Last Tycoon" from an outline. "I thought, Gosh, it must be easy to write a book from an outline," Weld recalls. So he tried one. "It took me 15 to 20 minutes."
He then dictated the narrative onto tapes for his secretary to transcribe, devoting one day every weekend to the task and finishing the first draft in eight weeks. His muses, he says, included Thomas Mann and Graham Greene. As he refined the novel over subsequent drafts, he kept a careful record of each version, "just in case some jaundiced observer should suggest there must have been a ghostwriter somewhere."
The result offers no life lessons and suggests no particular conviction, a charge that Weld's political critics have often levied against him. As the protagonist caroms through a weightless adventure that clocks in under 250 pages, his emotions remain inscrutable and his demeanor aloof, very much like his author's.
"I still have nothing to say," Weld explains one afternoon in his Boston office, referring to a remark he once made about being intrigued by the idea of writing a novel, but not being able to identify a message he wanted to get across. "I'm the guy who hates politicians who preach at you."
The next day, the subject recurs as he, his wife, Susan Roosevelt Weld, and one of his five children, Mary, sit on their vast, well-shaded lawn.
Susan says she did not actually crack the book but had Mary read it to her as they drove from Cambridge to New Haven, where Mary attends Yale. The two-hour drive proved ample time.
"It's a bagatelle," Weld confirms.
"Large print," his wife chimes in.
"Generous margins," Weld adds.
The exchange captures Weld's charm: his occasionally self-effacing humor, his banter. But it also suggests the lack of gravitas that made his political career so offbeat and unlikely, and arguably curtailed it.
Mary Weld, enjoying tiny spoonfuls of brownie batter interspersed with mincing sips from a quart of milk, weighs in with her own appraisal. "I'm glad it has no moral," she says. "A moral would be pompous."
Weld's tenure as governor from 1991 to 1997 was so successful that observers often forget how improbably he squeaked into office, and how much his personal wealth and fortunate circumstances mattered. Back in 1990, when he first ran, he was a leaden public speaker. He had never held any elective office, and while his experience as a high-ranking member of the U.S. Justice Department in the 1980's gave him law-enforcement credentials, he was untested on other issues. At their convention, state Republicans endorsed his rival in the primary, Steven Pierce. Howell remembers, "I couldn't get reporters to come to a campaign event if I promised that Bill Weld would be biting off the heads of chickens."
But Weld pumped about $1 million of his own money into his primary campaign, handily outspending Pierce. And primary voters gambled that Weld's liberal social views -- arising from his distaste for bigotry or any other limit to individual expression and potential -- gave him a better chance against the eventual Democratic nominee than Pierce had. Weld won the primary and then, in the general election, capitalized on voters' exasperation with the state's economic woes and their willingness to try a change from decades of Democratic leadership. He narrowly defeated a weak opponent, John R. Silber.
This was not the triumph of a man with a potent sense of calling or long history of political involvement. Although his years as a classics major and law student at Harvard coincided with the activism of the late 1960's, Weld was largely unmoved by it.
"He is the last person to get agitated about anything," says Mitchell Adams, a Harvard classmate who became the state's revenue commissioner under Weld and still holds that position. Adams and other classmates say that Weld stood out, instead, for his seemingly effortless mastery of his studies and zest for competitive games. "He played squash with a gentleman's relish," recalls Peter Lubin, another classmate. "He was very good at chess, and could beat people with his back to the board. It was a party trick he would do on occasion."
Weld approached the job of governing with a similar insouciance. He kept bankers' hours and seldom missed his thrice-weekly appointments on the squash court. After signing a bill to protect waterways, he dove, fully clothed, into the Charles River. Visitors to his office spotted a stuffed armadillo near his desk. "I like creatures who are slow and stupid," Weld explained.
For Massachusetts voters, Weld's levity and sublime confidence was a welcome relief after Gov. Michael Dukakis's severe prognostications. Moreover, he got the job done. Leading the national charge to trim welfare programs and generally rein in government spending, he reduced taxes while finding ample money for education and the environment. All the while, he had the cooperation of a Legislature still controlled by Democrats. In 1994, he was re-elected with a staggering 71 percent of the vote.
But aides said he was bored and had limited interest in serving out a second term. So he set his sights on the Senate, then the ambassadorship, which dovetailed with his curiosity about international affairs. Aides advised him that if he were looking toward the Presidency, such a job change and gambit were madness. Weld ignored them.
"He's not ambitious in the way most politicians are," explains Marty Linsky, his chief secretary from 1992 to 1995. "The stuff that most politicians care about it not important to him. He wants to have a good time. He wants to have fun. He wants to be engaged all the time, but his definition of engagement is different from most people's, like sitting at the end of a dock in the Adirondacks reading Greek."
Susan Weld emerges from the family's Cambridge house in a pink cotton dress, with a tall glass in her hand. She is the great-granddaughter of Theodore Roosevelt and a distinguished scholar of East Asian law, and it would seem fitting if she were carrying an iced tea or gin and tonic. But her cargo undulates. It lives. And without so much as arching an eyebrow, she asks: "Want to feed a maggot to the hedgehog?"
That would be Privet, who resembles a Lilliputian porcupine and divides his time between a glass aquarium in the kitchen and a makeshift outdoor pen. Crouching beside it, Susan Weld uses a stick to scoop grubs from the glass and leans close to Privet as he savors his snack.
"You have to put your head down so you can hear the crunching," she explains. "That's the best part of a hedgehog: the crunching."
The comment oddly echoes something Bill Weld said the previous day. He was talking about his regular business trips to Manhattan, where he has an apartment on Central Park South, and raving about a dinner at Balthazar, the cacophonous SoHo bistro. He, his wife, several of their children and a few friends began with "three deckers of chilled seafood, including snails and slugs, to which I'm particularly partial," he recounted. "These snails and slugs were so big you could see their ears, and hearing the ears crunch was too much for a couple of the ladies. So of course I made a show of it."
The Welds seem to have their own obscure sources of amusement. While others regarded the war of words between Weld and Helms last summer as a stomach-churning embarrassment for the Republican Party, the Welds pronounce it a grand diversion.
As Weld tells it, he ran into Helms months later and told the Senator that he wanted to buy him dinner, because Helms was the reason he was working as a high-priced lawyer and could afford to. When Helms responded that he usually ate at home, Weld turned to a companion and exulted, "Senator Helms has just invited me to his house for dinner!"
Weld guffaws at the memory. "Senator Helms was waving his arms, 'No, no, no,"' Weld says. So there was never a trip to Helms's house, for dinner or anything else. "No jammy party," Weld sighs.
Although he assumes that what he calls the "apostasy" of his liberal social views helped fuel Helms's opposition to him, he steadfastly refuses to bash either Helms or the religious right. That would imply that they rattled him, and it's not at all clear that that's possible. Besides, Weld says that he's happy now -- that there's more "intellectual content" in his current legal work advising venture capitalists and private equity firms than there was in his second term as Governor. And he has already finished the first draft of a sequel to "Mackerel by Moonlight." It took him seven days instead of eight.
Beyond that, he is maddeningly hazy about his future, quite possibly because he is waiting to feel the next tickle of his fancy. Friends say he once eyed the Presidency and probably, at some level, still does. When questioned directly, Weld gives answers that seem deliberately opaque. The year 2000, he says, is out, but if the Democrats win again and there is no plausible Republican challenger with moderate social views in 2004, "it's not so clear I'll be free to cultivate my own garden."
But by forcing a confrontation with his own party for a dubiously prominent position in a Democratic Administration, he came across as disloyal, to the point where a shot at the Presidency seems impossible, and a Republican President might be disinclined to consider him for the kinds of Cabinet posts he once discussed with President Clinton's advisers. "Politically," said Greg Mueller, a Republican political consultant, "he's in no man's land."
Even if he weren't, it's doubtful that Weld could ever muster the conventional sincerity for the ultimate political prize. "Bill Weld is the mirror opposite of Bill Clinton," says Stuart Stevens, a Republican media consultant. "Clinton tries to become you. He's like some sci-fi creature who wraps around you and sucks out your energy. Weld is a guy who knows who he is and is very comfortable with himself. He doesn't take himself that seriously."
At the end of the game in Fenway, which the Boston Red Sox win, Weld is briefly elated, then instantly intent on finding a route over the Charles, and into Cambridge, that circumvents traffic. His demeanor is rapt as he barks out directions -- left, right, faster, slower -- that brilliantly do the trick. He's home in a flash. It's not much of a journey, or much of an accomplishment, but it seems to give him great pleasure. He walks off into the night with a bounce in his step.

HEADLINE: Q. & A.;
A Tenant Overpays On a Sublet

 BODY:

Q. My daughter has been subletting a rent-satbilized apartment in New York City for the last two years. She pays the rent to the tenant that had the apartment previous to her and not to the landlord.She believes that the real rent is approximately $500, however she pays $600. She has just been told that the rent would be increased to $1,000 or she must move. What rights does she have, if any? Can she contact the landlord and deal directly with him? ... Eli- nor Geller, Kendall Park, N.J. 

A. Edward T. Braverman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that under state law, tenants in buildings with four or more rental units (except municipal housing and co-ops) have a right to sublease their apartment. The right is subject to the consent of the landlord, which may not be unreasonably withheld.
In rent-stabilized settings, Mr. Braverman said, the sublet rent cannot exceed the rent set for that apartment under the Rent Stabilization Code. However, he said, if an apartment is being sublet on a furnished basis, the tenant may charge the subletting tenant an additional 10 percent. Moreover, he said, a rent-stabilized tenant may not sublet an apartment for more than two out of every four years.
"In applying the foregoing principles, the prime tenant may have already overcharged the subtenant," Mr. Braverman said, explaining that the most the tenant can charge the subtenant would be 10 percent more than the tenant himself is paying, and then only if the apartment was furnished.
"As with a regular landlord, the prime tenant would be responsible for the return of the overcharge to the subtenant," he said. And since the Division of Housing and Community Renewal usually takes the position that there is a presumption of an intent to overcharge, Mr. Braverman said, the damages that the subtenant would be entitled to under that presumption would be three times the actual overcharge, plus, perhaps, a lawyer's fees.
Accordingly, he said, since the subtenant has already been in the apartment for two years, neither the original tenant nor the subtenant have the right to extend the sublease further without the landlord's permission. "And there is certainly no authority for the prime tenant to increase the rent to $1,000," he said.
Additional information on subletting -- along with guidance about what to do in the event of a rent overcharge -- can be obtained from the Division of Housing and Community Renewal by calling (718) 739-6400.
 
Condo Owner Finds Sublet Fee Troubling
 
Q. I own a condominium in White Plains that I rent to a tenant. At a meeting of the board of managers, the board voted to charge a "change of occupancy" fee of $500 each time a new tenant moves in. The board did not give each owner the right to vote on this and, as you can imagine, the fee is a deterrent to those of us who choose to rent out their unit and it is also very costly. Please advise whether this fee is legal. . . . Jo Baker, Madison, N.J.
 
A. "It is absolutely a legal fee," said William Robbins, a White Plains real estate lawyer.
Mr. Robbins explained that by law co-op and condominium boards have the right to take actions for the benefit of the building as a whole. Accordingly, he said, it is not unusual for boards to impose sublet fees or even to restrict the amount of time or number of times an apartment can be sublet.
"The truth is," Mr. Robbins said, "restrictions against subletting are usually for the owners' benefit. Number one, there is the feeling that with more owners living in a building, there will be more pride of ownership. And number two, if the number of sublets in the building goes anywhere above 50 percent, most banks won't go anywhere near the building with financing."
The only way the letter-writer would be able to overturn the board's decision, he said, would be to find enough tenants with similar feelings about the change of occupancy fee to vote out the present board and vote in a board that would eliminate the fee.

HEADLINE: Opposing Camps But Shared Opinions

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE

 BODY:
EVERY two years, since Naomi C. Matusow, a Democrat, did the unexpected in 1992 and beat a supposedly entrenched Republican for a seat in the State Assembly, the Republicans target Mrs. Matusow's seat as the one they will reclaim. In 1994 and 1996, the Republican candidate went down to defeat.
This year Republicans think that finally they have the recipe for success in the candidacy of Ursula G. LaMotte of Bedford, an articulate moderate Republican who serves on the County Board of Legislators. State Senator Nicholas A. Spano of Yonkers, chairman of the Westchester Republican Committee, said: "We have an outstanding candidate with a better message. I feel very good about the possibility of recapturing that seat." 
 But Democrats say that Mrs. LaMotte, a two-term County Legislator, should not start packing for Albany yet -- that Mrs. Matusow, also a resident of Bedford, is what her constituents in the 89th Assembly District want. "I think Naomi has won by increasing margins each time," said David A. Alpert, chairman of the County Democratic Committee. "She has a record people like."
The 89th Assembly District is made up of Bedford, Harrison, Mount Kisco, New Castle, North Castle, North Salem, Pound Ridge, Somers and part of White Plains. Republicans have a small edge over Democrats in enrollment, but there is also a large number of unenrolled independent voters. Mrs. LaMotte also has the Conservative Party line, while Mrs. Matusow has the Independence Party line.
The contest in the 89th District is one of seven Assembly races in the county, but the others are drawing less attention either because the entrenched incumbent has no opponent or the opponent is considered a long shot. In the 89th District both state Republicans and Democrats are expected to expend resources to help their respective candidates.
Separate interviews with Mrs. LaMotte and Mrs. Matusow suggest that the two share many of the same views and concerns. They are both pro-choice on abortion, and they express concern about economic development and taxes, children, crime, education and the environment.
And assuming the race stays in their gloved hands and is not turned over to outside party advisers (as sometimes happens in targeted races), it will be a positive campaign, with each emphasizing why she feels she has a record of achievement worthy of victory rather than trying to disparage her opponent's record. If this holds true, there will be no mudslinging in this race, no sloganism. "I don't want to get into a dirty campaign," Mrs. LaMotte said. "It's not necessary. My reading of the electorate is that they do not like it. I think we both have records that the people can judge."
Mrs. Matusow, a lawyer, said that would be a welcome change from two years ago when the campaign against her "was really negative and distorted my record beyond recognition." She added that she is not focusing on Mrs. LaMotte's record but on her own record. "I want to run a clean campaign; that is my intention," she said. Neither candidate has, each says, even spent much time scrutinizing the other's record.
What, then, distinguishes the two? Why is one a Republican and the other a Democrat when much of what they seem to stand for is similar? Mrs. LaMotte said she is a Republican because "I grew up in a very Republican household in the Eisenhower years, and those were good years for Republicans, I guess. Being a Republican seems to fit me." But she was quick to add: "I'm concerned about some of the trends in the Republican Party nationally, but I guess you'd call me a moderate. I think I'm a Westchester Republican as I understand them to be: pro-choice, pro-environment, in favor of keeping open space and being fiscally conservative."
Her role model is Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, and Mrs. LaMotte said she wants to go to Albany because "my concerns with the state government are very deep."
"I feel certainly our Governor has turned things around, and we are moving in the right direction," she said, "but we haven't gotten there yet." One of the obstacles to this, she said, is Sheldon Silver, the Speaker of the Democratic-controlled Assembly, whom Mrs. Matusow almost always supports, she said.
Mrs. Matusow said she is a Democrat because of the issues focused on by Democrats: "Being pro-choice, being concerned with the safety of children, being concerned with preserving the environment, providing quality public education, both at the secondary and college level, banning assault weapons." She added: "It's very fortunate for me that I can talk about these issues in a community where people want to know about the issues. Party labels don't carry any sway." She defeated Peter Sullivan of White Plains, a seemingly unstoppable Republican, in 1992 "because he didn't do things for people."
She continued, "I have been re-elected twice in spite of the fact that I have been the No. 1 target of the Republicans because the people in the district respect what I do."
The parts of her record Mrs. Matusow emphasizes include support for a ban on assault weapons (legislation that has died in the Republican-controlled Senate; the ban is supported by Mrs. LaMotte as well), a follow-through on campaign pledges to get more state school aid for her district, although she says it is still not enough, and her efforts as a member of the Assembly's Economic Development Committee to cut taxes in the state. "I have worked very hard to see that we cut taxes, sales tax, property taxes and the income tax," she said. "I have been instrumental in seeing tax cuts that total $10 billion." Her votes helped enact the state's School Tax Relief program, known as STAR, which lowers all property owners' school taxes, and the elimination starting next year of sales tax on some clothes and footwear. She knows, she said, the loss of sales tax will cut millions of dollars in revenue for Westchester governments, and she has vowed to push to get the state to reimburse the county, cities and other taxing districts.
She was endorsed this year by the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental organization. She also said she worked hard to pass Megan's Law, which requires that local officials be notified when sex offenders move into their community. A priority for the next term would be a law that allows schools, day-care centers and other agencies to fingerprint and do background checking on prospective employees who might work with children, the elderly or the infirm.
Mrs. LaMotte's civil associations are many and will, she said, help make her a good lawmaker. She is a former member of the County Planning Board and a former Deputy Supervisor in Bedford. She helped start recycling programs in the 1970's before they were mandated. And she is on the board of the Children's Aid Society of New York City, the Visiting Nurses of the Hudson Valley and the Boys and Girls Club of Northern Westchester. She was also a board member of the Westchester Children's Association. "My work with children's groups has given me great insight into social problems," she said. Housing issues, she said, is another top concern of hers.
Mrs. LaMotte serves on three committees on the Democratic-controlled Board of Legislators: the influential Budget and Appropriations Committee, as well as the Environment and Health Committees. As a County Legislator, she said, her accomplishments include increasing the dedicated parkland in the county, helping to defeat a proposed high occupancy vehicle lane for I-287 and encouraging long-term planning.
But there does seem to be a few issues on which they differ. Mrs. LaMotte supported a bill two years ago that would have set up the mechanism for the county government to reassess all property in the county. Mrs. Matusow voted against it. While it ultimately passed the Board of Legislators and then both the Senate and the Assembly, it was vetoed by Gov. George E. Pataki. Mrs. LaMotte is also in favor of the death penalty. Mrs. Matusow is not.
Neither candidate said she believes President Clinton's problems will affect the race. The voters in the district, they say, are too smart to let what is happening in Washington influence their votes for state office.

HEADLINE: In the Region / New Jersey;
Elizabeth Is Razing Its Time-Worn Public Housing

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WYNONA ANCRUM is looking forward to the day when she and her family will be able to move out of her time-worn public-housing complex in the Elizabethport section of Elizabeth into a new town-house-style apartment with a yard and front porch.
"The new housing will provide an uplift, a new outlook on life, especially for children who will be able to live in something better, live in a house," said the 43-year-old Ms. Ancrum, who has lived in her apartment in the 250-unit, eight-building Migliore Manor project for 20 years. She shares it with her mother, grown son and granddaughter. 
 Ms. Ancrum -- who is president of the Migliore Manor Resident Council, as well as a member of the Board of Commissioners of the Housing Authority of the City of Elizabeth -- is working with the authority on a five-year program to replace both Migliore Manor and the adjacent 405-unit, 12-building Pioneer Homes with new housing.
The complexes, which overlook the Arthur Kill, were built in 1940 and 1953 and are home to about 1,450 families, with an average annual income of $8,200. That compares with $24,487 a year for households in the rest of the struggling neighborhood of Elizabethport.
"This program," said Mayor J. Christian Bollwage, "is the start of a change that will provide a better quality of living than has existed for the last 30 years." It will also have a domino effect in the entire neighborhood, he added.
"As long as the high-density public housing remained untouched," Mayor Bollwage said, "there was no real incentive for private investment to come into the area."
A mix of at least 600 new and renovated residences, both rental and for-sale, are planned, including row houses, duplexes and detached homes. About 308 of them, including 60 units reserved for the elderly, will rise on the site of the two public housing complexes, which will be razed.
The designated developer for those units is a joint venture of the private Community Investment Strategies of New Brunswick and Liberty Group of Portland, Me.
The remaining units will take shape on scattered sites elsewhere in Elizabethport, which is in the far eastern corner of this Union County city. It is isolated from the rest of the municipality by the New Jersey Turnpike, which cut through the neighborhood in the 50's and contributed to its decline. Urban Strategies L.L.C. of Manhattan will develop most of these units along with other private and nonprofit developers.
The rebuilding program, expected to cost about $80 million, will start next month with the demolition of three now-vacant public housing buildings, with a total of 129 units within the two complexes. This will pave the way for construction of the first 72 on-site units, which is to start in January. At about the same time construction is to begin on eight two-family homes off-site on Front Street.
The rest of the units, both on and off site, are to be built in the next five years.
Financing for the program is coming in part from a $28.9 million grant from the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which the city received last October. The rest has and will come from other public as well as private sources.
The Federal grant requires that housing for people with higher incomes be part of the neighborhood mix. The new public housing units in Elizabethport will be targeted to families making up to 80 percent of the area's median income. For a family of four, 80 percent of the median would be $51,760.
The Federal grant also provides for job training and courses for residents in such matters as money management -- reflecting the theory of many housing advocates that new residences alone will not solve all the problems of public housing.
To help solve such problems, the city is turning the city's industrial waterfront into a recreational area, with a marina in place and recreational fields planned.
And to address the problem of jobs, said Mayor Bollwage, a retail-skills center will work in tandem with a $350 million mall with more than a million square feet now under construction northeast of Elizabethport. The complex, which is to be called the Jersey Gardens Mall, is scheduled to open November 1999.
Elizabeth is among the latest cities in New Jersey -- which has about 53,000 public housing units, according to the Newark office of H.U.D. -- to move forward with such a rebuilding program.
FOR the last six years, Newark has been involved in the state's largest program -- calling for the razing of 12 bleak public housing towers and replacing them with a total of 1,777 low-rise units. So far, eight towers have been razed and 949 of the new units have been built or are under construction. The rest are in various stages of planning or development, said Harry Robinson, a spokesman for the Newark Housing Authority.
Late last month New Brunswick received a $7.5 million Federal grant to initiate a $30 million program to replace the New Brunswick Homes public-housing complex with 246 units in four eight-story buildings alongside Route 18, not far from the city's downtown. The complex will be razed and replaced with 198 new units, both on the site and elsewhere in the city. Some 146 families now living in the complex have accepted Section 8 certificates for rental subsidies to move elsewhere, said Glenn Patterson, director of the city's Department of Policy, Planning and Economic Development. Demolition is at least a year or two away, he added.
High-density, and often high-rise, public housing projects started springing up in the 50's as a safe and economical way to house low-income families. But over time many of the projects -- beset by crime, neglect, overcrowding and mismanagement -- became the housing of last resort for the poorest of families.
The Federal Government no longer supports the building of high-density, high-rise public housing for families. About three years ago the Government also ended the one-to-one replacement program. Previously, a 1987 Federal law forbade razing public housing apartments unless they were replaced with an equal number of units.
In Elizabeth, the garden-style Pioneer Homes and Migliore Manor are the densest of the city's seven public-housing projects, totaling 1,678 units of which 600 are in four buildings reserved for elderly residents. The complexes, designed with their backs to the street facing interior courtyards, also became magnets for a tangle of urban ills, including crime and drug trafficking.
"The problem was one of having too many people of the same economic means living on too little land," said William D. Jones, executive director of the Elizabeth housing authority. The solution, he said, is to reduce the density and provide housing that "will mix the incomes better."
Under the plan, crafted over the last 20 months with input from tenants, the new housing will reduce the density on the eight-block site by 68 percent to 15 dwelling units per acre, which is close to the 11 dwelling units per acre found in the surrounding neighborhood. And by making units available to people of differing incomes the number of very-low-income families will be reduced to 53 percent from 89 percent.
All existing qualified public housing tenants will be guaranteed one of the new units built on or off site. But they also can accept Section 8 certificates for rent subsidies and move elsewhere if they choose.
As now planned the apartments will rent for $500 to $600 a month (the rent for public-housing tenants is capped at 30 percent of their income). Prices for the one- and two-family homes are expected to be $65,000 to $140,000, which is market-rate for the area, said Mr. Jones. Estimates are that 25 to 40 public-housing families will become homeowners, he added.
The first 72 on-site units that Community Investment Strategies will build will be rentals. They will rise along Front Street and nearby side streets, and 80 percent of them will be reserved for public-housing families, said Christiana Foglio, the company's president.
"This is not a program of gentrification," she added.
The apartments will have one to four bedrooms and 670 to 1,500 square feet. Monthly rents for public-housing tenants are capped at 30 percent of income. The rest will rent for $550 to $900 a month. Completion is expected by January 2000, said Ms. Foglio.
Mr. Jones, the housing authority director, said the one- and two-family homes under the rebuilding program would have two and three bedrooms and 1,000 to 1,400 square feet. The initial eight off-site two-family homes will also rise on Front Street. Sale prices are expected to be $65,000 to $140,000, which is market rate for the neighborhood, he said.

Avalon Expected to Nearly Triple Stamford Rentals

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
WHEN Avalon Bay Communities completes two rental apartment projects under construction in Stamford -- and if it wins expected approvals on a third -- it will add 1,132 units to the total of 638 rental units it has already built in the city at Avalon Glen and Avalon Grove.
Since it was formed in 1993 as a real estate investment trust with headquarters in Alexandria, Va., Avalon has built in Connecticut alone a total of 1,106 units in Wilton, Trumbull and Hamden, and it has built or renovated more than 42,300 apartments in 29 markets across the country. The company focuses on building luxury rental apartments in or near major cities. 
 Over the next decade Avalon and other developers are expected to produce a combined total of 2,800 rental apartments in and around the downtown business district in Stamford, a city where almost half of the housing units are rentals.
According to Robin Stein, Stamford's land-use planner, "there is a tremendous need for housing people who work in the corporations and want to live downtown."
Samuel Fuller, regional vice president for Avalon Bay Communities in Wilton, noted the more than 98 percent occupancy rate of the existing Avalon rental complexes and reiterated his company's belief that Connecticut is grossly underbuilt in rental housing. But in the current climate of economic uncertainty, he added, "we are no longer moving into some of the more peripheral markets like Greater Hartford."
Stamford's increased need for housing results from its plummeting office vacancy rate, now 6 percent compared with 22 percent in 1992. Paul Bruenich, managing partner at William Pitt Real Estate, said:
"There is the potential for adding another 1.8 million square feet to the 15 million square feet of offices, and there is virtually no inventory in rental apartments. People moving up from Manhattan are accustomed to renting."
"We have over 40,000 units of housing in Stamford," said Mayor Dannel Malloy. "What's significant is that we are creating more housing downtown than any other city. Much of it is upper end, but we have older buildings that may no longer command high rents, and we intend to have an impact on all economic levels by redeveloping Southfield Village and rehabilitating Housing Authority property on Connecticut Avenue. We will see 2,000 units built without a single unit of lower-income housing being displaced."
Out of five major projects under way or planned in Stamford, four will offer 20 percent of the apartments at lower than market rates. Through a state formula, developers are given extra units in return for the reduced rents.
Avalon Corners, one of Avalon's projects now under way, is rising on three acres along Washington Boulevard, close to the business district and railroad station. The $32.5-million project, which will have a 24-hour concierge, will contain 195 one- and two-bedroom apartments.
In the courtyard there will be a heated swimming pool, a picnic area with barbecue grills, walking paths and landscaping. A clubhouse will feature a room for private parties, billiard room, a business center with computers and fax machines, a conference center and a fully equipped fitness center.
Each apartment will have a full-sized washer-dryer, designer kitchen and walk-in closets, and some will have gas fireplaces and lofts. Completion is targeted for the spring of 2000.
Rentals for one-bedroom units measuring 778 to 1,177 square feet will be at market rates of $1,500 to $1,800 a month. Two bedroom units of 1,077 to 1,547 square feet will rent for $1,800 to $2,200.
Another Avalon project, a joint venture with Landmark American of Portland, Me., will have the 20 percent component of lower cost units. It will replace the vacant city-owned Burdick Elementary School at Greyrock Place, currently being razed by Landmark American.
Landmark American acquired the 3.3-acre property for $6 million. "We outbid Avalon for the site," said Pam Gleichman, chief operating officer at Landmark American. Construction will begin next month on 306 apartments in a 15-story building, with completion scheduled for the spring of 2000.
LANDMARK AMERICAN will build the project with two tennis courts and underground parking for 460 cars, all subject to Avalon's approval. In an unusual arrangement for both companies, once the building is completed it will be turned over to Avalon under a presale agreement, the terms of which neither company wished to disclose.
A third Avalon project is to have 325 units and rise on a former industrial waterfront site for which it is currently negotiating. The company declined to make details of the project available.
"Still in the talking stage" is a fourth rental project that Stamford is promoting, said Mr. Stein, the land-use planner. A developer has not yet been chosen for the project, which will contain some 800 to 900 apartments with a 20 percent lower-income component. It will rise in the Mill River Corridor, a 20-acre downtown area anchored by an existing park and running south along the narrow river.
"The Mayor has asked city boards to begin processing zone changes and to declare an urban redevelopment area for new housing, improved parkland, a walkway extending from the University of Connecticut's new Stamford branch to the harbor, and a commercial development component," said Mr. Stein. The commercial sites, both on Washington Boulevard, are owned by the Hoffman family, local real estate operators, and the Dreyfus Corporation of New York City.
The fifth project, scheduled to begin construction next month, is the initial phase of Park Square West, a downtown complex of apartments, entertainment and shops that will fill the last undeveloped sector of Stamford's urban renewal district. Corcoran-Jennison of Dorchester, Mass., is the designated developer.
Demolition of an existing building has begun, and "we are working with a couple of investors before starting construction," said Marty Jones, Corcoran-Jennison's president. A $26-million Connecticut Housing Finance Authority mortgage is expected shortly and the sale of Federal tax credits for the 20 percent component of low-rent units will provide the developer with $2.5 million in cash, according to Julie Walpole, project director.
The first 143 units of an eventual 400 studio- to three-bedroom apartments will range in size from 600 to 1,000 square feet. Tentative rents are $1,130 to $2,500 and occupancy of the first phase is targeted for the spring of 2000.
Just east of Stamford in Darien, a proposal for yet another Avalon community called Avalon Hollow is facing some hurdles. Mr. Fuller and his associates presented their plan to a public hearing earlier this month, which will be continued Oct. 13. The proposal calls for 189 one- to three-bedroom units in 24 buildings on 32 acres.
The triangular site has been characterized by the developer as "unattractive, neglected and well-suited for a luxury apartment community." The site is typical of marginal locations that test the ingenuity of developers in land-scarce Lower Fairfield County.
Bounded by I-95, Metro-North's railroad tracks and the Noroton River -- the boundary between Darien and Stamford -- its sole apparent virtue is that it's vacant. A former gravel quarry, it is veined with streams, has pockets of wetlands, a manmade pond and an abandoned sanitary sewer pump station belonging to the Town of Darien.
To reach it Avalon had to obtain a 50-foot right-of-way from Hollow Tree Ridge Road through a three-acre parcel proposed for an apartment building by the Duhaime and Trukowski families. A decision on the families' application to build 148 units is due in October, according to Jeremy Ginsberg, senior town planner. Approval would not affect the right-of-way, but some apartments could be built as a bridge over it.
Avalon's plan contains 10 different apartment configurations, with 20 percent at reduced rental rates. There would be cathedral ceilings, crown moldings, large deep soaking tubs, and individual garages. Market rates would range from $1,650 to $3,000 a month and rent-restricted rates would be $1,000 to $1,200 a month, Mr. Fuller said.
Four speakers at the project's recent public hearing were concerned that traffic generated by the adjacent Noroton Heights railroad station would be worsened when Avalon residents mingle with local and commuter vehicles on Hollow Ridge Road.
Opposition to Avalon's communities in the many affluent Connecticut towns where it has built apartments is nothing new. Rental housing is frequently considered declasse, particularly when combined with below-market-rate units. However, a 1989 Connecticut Housing Appeals Law mandates that when legal action is taken by a developer or a town with regard to projects containing the 20 percent lower-rent units, the town must prove that it is detrimental to the welfare of the community in order to reject it.
"We expect to be turned down and go to court," said Mr. Fuller.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
A Middle-Income Housing Program Gathers Steam

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
RELAXED on a park bench a few days ago, Joseph Scarpinito looked across the street at the nearly complete apartment house he is building in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn and speculated on what might have happened on the site, but didn't.
"We were thinking it could have been a rehab, with 17 tax-credit or HOME units," he said. That's builder jargon for two forms of public subsidy used to build low-income housing. Until recently they were the primary mechanisms available for bringing public funds to bear in assisting multifamily rental construction anywhere in the city outside central Manhattan. 
 Usually the low-income programs are used to renovate existing buildings rather than build new ones. Any builder with a site that needs some public subsidy, however little, to be economically feasible, would have to tap into the low-income programs to build a multifamily rental.
The Scarpinito family, owners of JES Construction, a Brooklyn-based contractor-builder, would have been limited to rehabilitating an existing warehouse structure on the 22,000-square-foot site for low-income housing. It was large enough for only 17 apartments.
Instead, JES Construction has been able to demolish the old building and produce 52 apartments in a new eight-story building, called St. John's Apartments, at 287 Prospect Avenue. The site is off Sixth Avenue in the South Slope section of Park Slope, with St. John's Lutheran Church next door and the Prospect Expressway across the street.
The rents are $950 to $1,000 a month for the 30 one-bedroom apartments and $1,200 to $1,400 a month for the 22 two-bedroom two-bath apartments. Applicants, whose income must fall within certain ranges, are currently being interviewed at an on-site rental office. Occupancy will start in mid-October.
This outcome on the Scarpinito property is being replicated throughout middle-income neighborhoods of the city as a new program initiated by the city Housing Development Corporation moves into high gear. H.D.C. is a state-chartered public benefit corporation that provides bond financing for multifamily housing. Russell A. Harding became its president this year.
The first phase of the production program got under way last year with a $15 million subsidy from the corporation. Twelve construction projects have been initiated. Six of them are already being built and the rest are well advanced in the development pipeline. Seven of the 12 are from-the-ground-up new construction projects. Three are gut rehabilitations of existing but vacant residential buildings. And two are conversions of vacant nonresidential buildings in Brooklyn to housing use -- a former parochial school in Carroll Gardens and the former Clermont Armory in Fort Greene.
When completed the 12 projects will provide 930 new apartments at an estimated total development cost of $127 million.
The income guidelines under the program are so calculated that in principle a two-bedroom apartment with an allowable rent of $1,150 a month could be taken by a family of four earning as much as $105,600 a year. But in fact, because of the housing choices typically made by families of varying incomes, most tenants are likely to have earnings in the range of $35,000 to $70,000 a year.
The rent limits under the program are $800 a month for a studio apartment, $1,100 for a one-bedroom, $1,500 for a two-bedroom and $1,750 for a three-bedroom. The actual rents that builders charge, which reflect local housing markets, are normally lower than the allowable maximums by several hundred dollars a month. Occasionally they are a bit higher.
THE announcement of the program brought forth a number of developers who have previously done business with the Housing Development Corporation, had established a favorable track record and already had control of sites that were appropriate for multifamily development. They are in locations that do not require or justify the high public cost per housing unit that low-income subsidies provide.
In the middle-income program the Housing Development Corporation subsidy is a maximum of $20,000 an apartment, provided by way of a second mortgage at 1 percent interest. The average in Phase 1 has been about $17,000 an apartment.
Using this subsidy in conjunction with taxable bonds issued by the corporation has given the projects the assurance of longterm mortgage debt at an interest rate of about 6 or 7 percent, Mr. Harding said. New buildings also get a 25-year tax abatement under the city's Section 421a abatement program, instead of the 15 years that is standard for conventionally financed multifamily buildings outside central Manhattan. Rehabilitations are eligible for the city's J-51 tax abatement.
As one result of all this, Bell Realty of Great Neck, L.I., decided to put a 122-unit apartment tower above the store it is building for Staples between 58th and 59th Street on Queens Boulevard in Woodside. The 70,000-square-foot site was to have been developed in the 80's with a 19-story condominium and a school, but the property fell into foreclosure.
"We had the foundation in place for a future tower, but without the middle-income program it would not have been built at this time," said Charles J. Belanich, a partner in the project. Completion is expected in a year.
Another result is that Cheever Development Corporation of Brooklyn, owned by the Lonuzzi family, and Community Developers, headed by Getz Obstfeld, former director of the Banana Kelly nonprofit housing development organization in the Bronx, have been able to move forward with a long-delayed project, the rehabilitation of the former St. Agnes parochial school, long vacant, in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn.
"We had tried to develop the building for housing for the elderly, but that wasn't successful because of the cost and the difficulty of adapting the building," said Mr. Obstfeld. "The numbers worked perfectly for the H.D.C. program." It is a $10 million project that will create 90 apartments at 421 DeGraw Street, near Hoyt Street across the street from St. Agnes Roman Catholic Church. The construction loan closed in July and completion is scheduled for next summer.
In Queens, the Ciampa Organization is using the financing at the D. C. Colonnade, a new 60-unit building at 136-43 37th Avenue in downtown Flushing, a block from Main Street and Northern Boulevard. It is Ciampa's first new multifamily rental in 12 years, said Dominick Ciampa, a principal in the family-owned building company, which was founded in the 1920's. The project uses a subsidy of only $8,000 an apartment. Its rent schedule is accordingly a bit higher than most of the others.
IN the Rego Park section, the Bluestone Organization of Flushing will use the program for a 132-unit building at 65-90 Austin Street; Galaxy Construction of the Bronx will build a 110-unit project on West 238th Street, overlooking the Major Deegan Expressway in the Kingsbridge section; Leewood Development, based in Staten Island, will produce 74 apartments in a neighborhood of new homes known as Rainbow Hill, near the Staten Island Expressway.
And in the Baychester section of the Bronx, MacQuesten Development Corporation, based in Mount Vernon, N.Y., closed just a few days ago on the loan that will produce 67 garden-style apartments off Baychester Avenue. They are the first phase of what will be a 135-unit project in four contiguous four-story buildings. The two-acre site, now vacant, is bounded by Palmer Avenue, Tillotson Avenue and Given Avenue. The architect is DePasquale and Geremia Architects and Planners of Mount Vernon.
The rehabilitations of existing residential buildings involve the following properties: two vacant four-story buildings at 471 Vanderbilt Avenue and 12-18 Gates Avenue in Fort Greene, into 26 apartments; 39-07 208th Street in the Bayside section of Queens, also as 26 units; and seven buildings in Harlem -- on Frederick Douglass Boulevard and St. Nicholas Avenue between 118th and 120th Streets -- as 80 apartments.
Renting is done by the owner. The Housing Development Corporation provides callers with information on how to go about applying for an apartment. The phone number is (212) 344-8080.

Techniques for Cutting Wood, Tile and Masonry

BYLINE: By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI

 BODY:
MOST household cutting jobs consist of slicing through paper, cloth or wood. Do-it-yourselfers can easily handle these cutting chores although sometimes cutting lumber to size can present problems.
Consider plywood, for example. It's easy to cut but often the saw splinters the wood and leaves an unsightly edge. One way to avoid this is by putting a strip of masking tape along the cut line and then sawing through the tape and board at the same time. Another way is by scoring the cut line with a sharp utility knife before cutting. 
 If you're using a hand saw, the good side of the panel should be up. The saw will splinter the bottom, i.e. the bad side, as you push down. The reverse is true if you cut plywood with a circular saw. The good side of the panel should be down because the sawblade cuts as it comes up. You will also get a smoother cut with a circular saw if you use an 80-tooth carbide blade in the saw.
Cutting down the center of a full 4 by 8-foot sheet of plywood can be awkward because you have to reach off balance to make the cut. The job can be made easier if you lay a few 2 by 4's on the work floor first, then position the plywood panel on these. The 2 by 4's should be parallel to the cut. Adjust the depth of the blade on your saw so it just goes through the plywood. Now you can push the saw as you kneel directly on the panel.
Cutting through masonry and ceramics is a difficult task that requires special tools or blades. You can cut into a concrete block, or paver, with your circular saw, provided you use a masonry blade. Do not try to cut completely through a thick concrete block; instead cut a groove about 1/2-inch deep on all four sides. Then use a heavy hammer to break the block in two. This will leave a rough surface at the break.
If you require a clean cut, you can rent a concrete saw fitted with a diamond cutting blade. It can cut to a depth of four inches. Sawing through concrete creates a lot of dust and noise. Try to work outdoors whenever possible and be sure to wear appropriate eye, hearing and dust protective gear.
You don't need a special saw or blade to cut bricks, but there is a knack to doing it. An experienced mason can cut a brick in half simply by whacking it with the edge of a heavy trowel. This technique takes a bit of practice to master. Most do-it-yourselfers will find it easier to break the brick by striking it with a hammer and wide masonry chisel.
There is another technique for cutting a brick. Score a groove about 1/8-inch deep in the top of the brick with a cold chisel. Place the brick on a 1/2-inch dowel or pipe, grooved-side up, so the dowel is directly under the groove. Press down on both ends of the brick to snap it in two.
Tile installations always require trimming a few full-sized tiles into narrower widths. Professional tilers use a wet saw for this. The tool has a circular diamond blade. A water jet directed at rotating blade cools it and washes away tile debris.
This tool is particularly effective for cutting thin pieces of tile. It also leaves smooth edges at the cut. This is important if those edges are to be left exposed. The wet saw is essential for cutting tiles made of marble and stone. A cutting saw can usually be rented at tile suppliers, but it can be expensive. Also the tile saw is big and requires two people to move it to the job site.
Do-it-yourselfers may find it easier and more economical to rent a snap cutter. Strictly speaking, the term "cutter" is a misnomer because the tool does not actually cut the tile. Instead, it breaks it along a scored line.
Snap cutters are available in various configurations, but they use the same cutting principle. The tile is placed on the bed, over a raised cutting bar.
A sharp cutting wheel is drawn across the tile face. The wheel does not cut the tile but only scores the surface. Pressing down on the cutting arm puts pressure on the edges of the tile. On either side of the cutting bar are soft rubber pads that "give" when pressure is applied. The pressure on the tile ends makes it snap at the cutting bar. If the break leaves a rough edge, you can smooth it with a rubbing stone.

HEADLINE: KOFI ANNAN'S Astonishing Facts!

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

 BODY:
Every year, the United Nations Human Development Report looks for a new way to measure the lives of people. Putting aside faceless statistics like per capita gross domestic product or export-import figures, the report burrows into the facts about what children eat, who goes to school, whether there is clean water to drink, how women share in the economy or who doesn't get vaccinations against diseases that go on killing even though they are preventable. This year, the report takes its first look at what people have -- from simple toilets to family cars -- and what proportion of the world's goods and services are consumed, comparatively, by the rich and by the poor. The pie is huge -- the world's consumption bill is $24 trillion a year -- but some servings are very small indeed. BARBARA CROSSETTE

GRAPHIC: Chart:
 
THE HAVES -- The richest fifth of the world's people consumes 86 percent of all goods and services while the poorest fifth consumes just 1.3 percent. Indeed, the richest fifth consumes 45 percent of all meat and fish, 58 percent of all energy used and 84 percent of all paper, has 74 percent of all telephone lines and owns 87 percent of
all vehicles.
 
NATURAL RESOURCES -- Since 1970, the world's forests have declined from 4.4 square miles per 1,000 people to 2.8 square miles per 1,000 people. In addition, a quarter of the world's fish stocks have been depleted or are in danger of being depleted and another 44 percent are being fished at their biological limit.
 
THE GANGES -- The Ganges River symbolizes purification to Hindus, who believe drinking or bathing in its waters will lead to salvation. But 29 cities, 70 towns and countless villages deposit about 345 million gallons of raw sewage a day directly into the river. Factories add 70 million gallons of industrial waste and farmers are responsible for another 6 million tons of chemical fertilizer and 9,000 tons of pesticides.
 
THE ULTRA RICH -- The three richest people in the world have assets that exceed the combined gross domestic product of the 48 least developed countries.
 
AFRICA -- The average African household today consumes 20 percent less than it did 25 years ago.
 
THE SUPER RICH -- The world's 225 richest individuals,
of whom 60 are Americans with total assets of $311 billion,
have a combined wealth of over $1 trillion --
equal to the annual income of the poorest 47 percent of
the entire world's population.
 
COSMETICS AND EDUCATION -- Americans spend $8 billion a year on cosmetics -- $2 billion more than the estimated annual total needed to provide basic education for everyone in the world.
 
THE HAVE NOTS -- Of the 4.4 billion people in developing countries, nearly three-fifths lack access to safe sewers, a third have no access to clean water, a quarter do not have adequate housing and a fifth have no access to modern health services of any kind.
 
MEAT -- Americans each consume
an average of 260 pounds
of meat a year. In Bangladesh, the average
is six and a half pounds.
 
THE FUTURE -- By 2050, 8 billion of the world's projected 9.5 billion people -- up from about 6 billion today -- will be living in developing countries.
 
SMOKE -- Of the estimated 2.7 million annual deaths from air pollution, 2.2 million are from indoor pollution -- including smoke from dung and wood burned as fuel which is more harmful than tobacco smoke. 80 percent of the victims are rural poor in developing countries.
 
WRISTWATCHES AND RADIOS -- Two thirds of India's 90 million lowest-income households live below the poverty line -- but more than 50 percent of these impoverished people own wristwatches, 41 percent own bicycles, 31 percent own radios and 13 percent own fans.
 
TELEPHONE LINES -- Sweden and the United States have 681 and 626 telephone lines per 1,000 people, respectively. Afghanistan, Cambodia, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have only one line per 1,000 people.
 
ICE CREAM AND WATER -- Europeans spend $11 billion a year on ice cream -- $2 billion more than the estimated annual total needed to provide clean water and safe sewers for the world's population.
 
AIDS -- At the end of 1997 nearly 31 million people were living with HIV, up from 22.3 million the year before. With 16,000 new infections a day -- 90 percent in developing countries -- it is now estimated that 40 million people will be living with HIV in 2000.
 
LANDMINES -- More than 110 million active landmines are scattered in 68 countries, with an equal number stockpiled around the world. Every month more than 2,000 people are killed or maimed by mine explosions.
 
PET FOOD AND HEALTH -- Americans and Europeans spend $17 billion a year on pet food -- $4 billion more than the estimated annual additional total needed to provide basic health and nutrition for everyone in the world.
 
$40 BILLION A YEAR -- It is estimated that the additional cost of achieving and maintaining universal access to basic education for all, basic health care for all, reproductive health care for all women, adequate food for all and clean water and safe sewers for all is roughly $40 billion a year -- or less than 4 percent of the combined wealth of the 225 richest people in the world.

HEADLINE: Kohl and His Story: New Chapter, or History?

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: BERLIN, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Change is not lightly accepted in a country where stability is paramount, and as Germany prepares to vote Sunday in national elections it appears gripped by last-minute doubts over whether the time has come to end the era of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
For months, Mr. Kohl has trailed his Social Democratic challenger, Gerhard Schroder, and it long seemed that the burden of 16 years in office was too much for even the Chancellor who presided over Germany's unification to overcome. But with a relentless conviction, Mr. Kohl has closed the gap to the point where poll takers say any outcome is possible. 
 This in itself is extraordinary. A whole generation of young Germans has never known anything but Mr. Kohl's leadership, and Mr. Schroder's slick campaign, bent above all on avoiding mistakes and conveying an image of modernity, has struck a chord with the many who yearn for a more self-confident Germany less burdened by its past.
The thirst for a new face, one unmarked by the experience of World War II, which indelibly fashioned Mr. Kohl's outlook, may still carry Mr. Schroder, 54, to victory. He remains the favorite, with a lead most opinion polls put at about 2 percent. But Europe's most powerful nation appears agonizingly torn between an awareness that new blood may be needed and a visceral distaste for risk.
Mr. Kohl's achievement has done much to diminish that risk. The place of a unified Germany in NATO and at the heart of a European Union that has adopted a single currency, the euro, is now questioned only by small fringes of the left and neo-Nazi right. Whatever the result, America's critical alliance with Germany will not be rocked.
But with a new century beckoning, a new global economy posing challenges to Germany's long-cohesive social model and the return to the new capital in Berlin about to be completed, Germans sense that their vote is of decisive importance. What they see less clearly is who should oversee the symbol-laden return to the Reichstag in 1999, 44 years after the defeat of the Nazi regime.
"We can't look at the face of Kohl any more," said Joachim Jens Hesse, a political scientist. "It's a physical thing, a psychological thing, just as the British tired of Mrs. Thatcher. But at the same time, this is such an awkward choice. I do not know if I can trust the Social Democrats, especially in coalition with the Greens."
Coalitions have always governed under Germany's parliamentary system, but a "Red-Green" alliance is as yet untried. The idea alarms some of the centrist voters to whom Mr. Schroder has been trying to appeal because the Greens have in the past called for sharp increases in gasoline taxes and a review of Germany's NATO membership.
The alternative for Mr. Schroder, if his Social Democratic Party emerges victorious but does not have enough votes to govern with the Greens, would be a so-called Grand Coalition with Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats -- a broad formula not tried for three decades.
Unwieldy, almost certainly condemned to be short-lived, such a coalition might at least provide the heft to push through the difficult reform of a welfare system that Germany is hard-pressed to afford. As in much of the rest of Europe, an aging population and high unemployment have strained public pension and social security payments.
The Christian Democrats have not closed the door to a Grand Coalition, but Mr. Kohl has said categorically that he would refuse to lead it. So, if the Christian Democrats emerge with more votes than the Social Democrats, but not enough to renew their current center-right coalition, the possibility exists that Mr. Kohl's acerbic deputy, Wolfgang Schauble, could emerge as the next Chancellor.
This outcome is not likely. But Mr. Schauble, 56, who has used a wheelchair since he was shot by a deranged man while campaigning eight years ago, has emerged in recent opinion polls as by far the most popular politician in Germany.
His suggestion that "16 weeks of Mr. Schroder will seem longer than 16 years of Mr. Kohl" has proved to be one of the more memorable phrases of a campaign in which oratory has scarcely soared. Mr. Schauble's popularity has in turn raised doubts about the wisdom of Mr. Kohl in insisting on seeking an unprecedented fifth term.
It is on Mr. Kohl's protracted rule that Mr. Schroder, the Premier of the state of Lower Saxony, has hammered, insisting in every speech that "Germany cannot afford four more years of Kohl."
As for the rest -- Germany's 4.1 million unemployed, Germany's role in Europe, the current world financial crisis, the replacement of Germany's beloved mark by the euro in 2002 -- Mr. Schroder has been much more vague, or simply silent, relying on images (like a meeting with Microsoft's Bill Gates), broad promises and rugged good looks to carry the day.
Four previous Social Democratic candidates have tried to take on Mr. Kohl by more confrontational means: Hans-Jochen Vogel in 1983, Johannes Rau in 1987, Oskar Lafontaine in 1990 and Rudolf Scharping in 1994. They all looked good for a while; they all failed. Not for nothing do Social Democratic posters insist, and insist again, that "Wir Sind Bereit" -- "We are ready."
Perhaps they are. In the end, it may be the unification of Germany, Mr. Kohl's crowning achievement, that proves his undoing.
Unification has proved extraordinarily costly. Germany has been transferring the equivalent of about 4.3 percent of its gross national product, or total output, to the east since 1990, straining public finances, transforming the area with new enterprises and urban projects, but failing to resolve the problems of the 16 million citizens of the former Communist state.
About one in five people of working age in the east is unemployed. The anger of these people, who once hailed Mr. Kohl for unifying the country, has been directed at the Christian Democratic Party, whose support in the area has plunged from close to 40 percent to under 30 percent.
These votes will not all go to the Social Democrats -- the Party of Democratic Socialism (former Communists) and various neo-Nazi groupings have both benefited -- but the damage to Mr. Kohl may prove insurmountable.
"There has been a free fall in Christian Democrat support in the east," said Lutz Erbring, a political analyst. "And I suspect it is in the east that the outcome of this election will be decided."
The other factor propelling Mr. Schroder is a vaguer but equally potent one. Germany has been in assertive mood of late -- its big corporations have been buying up the likes of Random House, Chrysler and Rolls-Royce -- and the Social Democratic challenger has contrived to symbolize this less cautious, less fettered spirit of a nation that feels it has labored under the weight of its past for long enough.
Mr. Schroder's call to rethink a planned Holocaust memorial in Berlin -- a monument strongly supported by Mr. Kohl -- has provided one of the few, clear policy conflicts between the two candidates and captured their differing priorities and preoccupations.
While Mr. Kohl dwells on the wounds of war, the glories of Germany's reconstruction, the building of a united Europe and the precious prize of peace, Mr. Schroder wants to shift the focus unflinchingly to the future.
He has by no means convinced everyone. The large number of undecided voters -- more than 20 percent, according to several polls -- appears to reflect in part the hesitations of many Germans in trusting a candidate who has shunned direct, declarative sentences throughout the campaign.
Analysts say that many of the so-called undecided are in fact people who will end up not voting, so their importance may be exaggerated. But if the hesitant opt in the end for Mr. Kohl's camp -- the reservoir of potential Christian Democratic voters is believed to be larger than that of the Social Democrats -- they could still swing the election.
"I am afraid that Kohl will still win it," said Andrea Zeller, a 25-year-old student, as she watched the Chancellor at a rally in Munich this week. "It's time for a change, but he always catches up." She added that she would vote for the Greens, but without the conviction that a "Red-Green" coalition could win.
In the last week of campaigning, Mr. Kohl has been playing on the fears of a conservative people, trying to portray Mr. Schroder as the gateway to a Communist presence in government. He has attacked Mr. Schroder's proposal to grant citizenship to some of Germany's seven million foreign residents, and warned of instability.
With unemployment falling -- it is expected to drop below four million this month after going as high as 4.8 million earlier this year -- and the German economy enjoying a recovery, Mr. Kohl's statements appear to have had an impact. His appearance as a rock of stability at a moment of world uncertainty, when the American President, Bill Clinton, is clearly distracted, has also helped his cause.
"A company that is doing well does not change its chief executive just because he has been there for 15 to 20 years," said Christoph Ahlhaus, 29, a banker. "Why should we?"
But the truth is that Germany has enough problems, and Mr. Kohl enough years in power, for Mr. Schroder to have a strong chance. Another truth is that, whoever wins, Germany is likely to flex its muscle more in the coming years.
"We do not want a European superstate," Mr. Kohl declared in Munich. "We want a strong Germany in Europe." That statement amounted to a shift: Germany long talked approvingly of a United States of Europe, with a truly federal system.
But the painful abandonment of the mark for the euro was Germany's pledge of good faith to the European idea. Now, whether under Mr. Schroder or under Mr. Kohl once again, or indeed under some other Chancellor, the country clearly feels it has the right and the might to make its voice heard, and to do so without any complexes.

Chart: "HOW IT WORKS: Two Roads to German Parliament"
The German national election combines majority and proportional representation by giving each citizen two votes, one for an individual and another for a party. Voters today will be given a ballot like the one below, which reads You have two votes. Here is how it works.
 
DISTRICT VOTE
 Cast for a candidate running in the voter's district.
 Half of the Parliament is elected through the district vote. Each candidate with the most votes in a district wins a parliamentary seat.
 
PARTY VOTE
 Cast for a party. Need not be tied to district party vote.
 Half of the Parliament is elected through the party vote. Seats are distributed to parties based on the percentage of votes won.
 
CURRENT PARLIAMENT: 672 SEATS
Christian Democrats/ Christian Socialists -- 44%
Social Democrats -- 38%
Free Democrats -- 7%
The Greens -- 7%
Democratic Socialists -- 4%

HEADLINE: KOFI ANNAN'S Astonishing Facts!

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

 BODY:
Every year, the United Nations Human Development Report looks for a new way to measure the lives of people. Putting aside faceless statistics like per capita gross domestic product or export-import figures, the report burrows into the facts about what children eat, who goes to school, whether there is clean water to drink, how women share in the economy or who doesn't get vaccinations against diseases that go on killing even though they are preventable. This year, the report takes its first look at what people have -- from simple toilets to family cars -- and what proportion of the world's goods and services are consumed, comparatively, by the rich and by the poor. The pie is huge -- the world's consumption bill is $24 trillion a year -- but some servings are very small indeed. BARBARA CROSSETTE

GRAPHIC: Chart:
 
THE HAVES -- The richest fifth of the world's people consumes 86 percent of all goods and services while the poorest fifth consumes just 1.3 percent. Indeed, the richest fifth consumes 45 percent of all meat and fish, 58 percent of all energy used and 84 percent of all paper, has 74 percent of all telephone lines and owns 87 percent of
all vehicles.
 
NATURAL RESOURCES -- Since 1970, the world's forests have declined from 4.4 square miles per 1,000 people to 2.8 square miles per 1,000 people. In addition, a quarter of the world's fish stocks have been depleted or are in danger of being depleted and another 44 percent are being fished at their biological limit.
 
THE GANGES -- The Ganges River symbolizes purification to Hindus, who believe drinking or bathing in its waters will lead to salvation. But 29 cities, 70 towns and countless villages deposit about 345 million gallons of raw sewage a day directly into the river. Factories add 70 million gallons of industrial waste and farmers are responsible for another 6 million tons of chemical fertilizer and 9,000 tons of pesticides.
 
THE ULTRA RICH -- The three richest people in the world have assets that exceed the combined gross domestic product of the 48 least developed countries.
 
AFRICA -- The average African household today consumes 20 percent less than it did 25 years ago.
 
THE SUPER RICH -- The world's 225 richest individuals,
of whom 60 are Americans with total assets of $311 billion,
have a combined wealth of over $1 trillion --
equal to the annual income of the poorest 47 percent of
the entire world's population.
 
COSMETICS AND EDUCATION -- Americans spend $8 billion a year on cosmetics -- $2 billion more than the estimated annual total needed to provide basic education for everyone in the world.
 
THE HAVE NOTS -- Of the 4.4 billion people in developing countries, nearly three-fifths lack access to safe sewers, a third have no access to clean water, a quarter do not have adequate housing and a fifth have no access to modern health services of any kind.
 
MEAT -- Americans each consume
an average of 260 pounds
of meat a year. In Bangladesh, the average
is six and a half pounds.
 
THE FUTURE -- By 2050, 8 billion of the world's projected 9.5 billion people -- up from about 6 billion today -- will be living in developing countries.
 
SMOKE -- Of the estimated 2.7 million annual deaths from air pollution, 2.2 million are from indoor pollution -- including smoke from dung and wood burned as fuel which is more harmful than tobacco smoke. 80 percent of the victims are rural poor in developing countries.
 
WRISTWATCHES AND RADIOS -- Two thirds of India's 90 million lowest-income households live below the poverty line -- but more than 50 percent of these impoverished people own wristwatches, 41 percent own bicycles, 31 percent own radios and 13 percent own fans.
 
TELEPHONE LINES -- Sweden and the United States have 681 and 626 telephone lines per 1,000 people, respectively. Afghanistan, Cambodia, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have only one line per 1,000 people.
 
ICE CREAM AND WATER -- Europeans spend $11 billion a year on ice cream -- $2 billion more than the estimated annual total needed to provide clean water and safe sewers for the world's population.
 
AIDS -- At the end of 1997 nearly 31 million people were living with HIV, up from 22.3 million the year before. With 16,000 new infections a day -- 90 percent in developing countries -- it is now estimated that 40 million people will be living with HIV in 2000.
 
LANDMINES -- More than 110 million active landmines are scattered in 68 countries, with an equal number stockpiled around the world. Every month more than 2,000 people are killed or maimed by mine explosions.
 
PET FOOD AND HEALTH -- Americans and Europeans spend $17 billion a year on pet food -- $4 billion more than the estimated annual additional total needed to provide basic health and nutrition for everyone in the world.
 
$40 BILLION A YEAR -- It is estimated that the additional cost of achieving and maintaining universal access to basic education for all, basic health care for all, reproductive health care for all women, adequate food for all and clean water and safe sewers for all is roughly $40 billion a year -- or less than 4 percent of the combined wealth of the 225 richest people in the world.

HEADLINE: A Killing Refocuses War on Abuse

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
HILDA UGUNA has become yet another grim statistic. She is one of 1,300 women a year in the United States killed by abusive partners.
The 19-year-old woman, fearing for her life, sought a court order of protection last month against her husband, who, she said, slept with a knife and threatened to kill her. But because the application to Family Court in White Plains did not meet the precise legal criteria for an emergency order, her plea was rejected, and her case was postponed until October. 
 The delay cost the young mother of three her life: five days after the emergency order was denied, her husband made good on his threats.
According to police reports, Luis Uguna, 27, a landscaper, stabbed his wife, a factory worker, many times in her chest and neck on Aug. 21, before stabbing himself twice in the sternum and jumping to his death from their fourth-floor apartment in Sleepy Hollow, where the couple, legal immigrants from Ecuador, lived. Two of their young children, an 8-month-old son and a 2-year-old daughter, saw the slaying, the Sleepy Hollow police said.
In the weeks since Mrs. Uguna's death, judges, lawyers and law-enforcement officials have called for changes in the legal system to thwart abusive men like Mr. Uguna. In doing so, they claim that too many domestic violence cases occur despite heightened public awareness of how widespread they have become.
"It shouldn't take a murder to call attention to the problem," Alan D. Scheinkman, the County Attorney, said. He observed that while killings often make the headlines, there are "dozens of other cases that occur where women and children are scarred forever." Under a state grant, Mr. Scheinkman has assigned two county lawyers to work with the county's Probation Department to enforce orders of protection.
According to a 1996 report by the American Psychological Association, nearly one in every three adult women experience at least one physical assault by a partner during adulthood. But most of those women fail to report the crime to law-enforcement agencies, the report said.
Of those who do seek help, many -- like Mrs. Uguna -- are unsuccessful because they are unable to get through the legal maze presented by criminal and family courts, said Judge Adrienne Hofmann Scancarelli, who denied the application and has since come under criticism from several quarters.
Judge Scancarelli said, however, that a complainant must report violence or the threat of violence to the courts to establish grounds for an emergency order of protection. She said Mrs. Uguna's application did not include information suggesting that Mr. Uguna posed an immediate threat. The judge said that she was therefore bound by the law.
"I did not see an emergency in that case," said the judge, who issues hundreds of such orders a year and described herself as "a very vocal advocate against domestic violence."
Many who have questioned the judge's decision said it would have been wiser to abide by the spirit of the law -- which is to protect people like Mrs. Uguna -- than to obey its letter.
"What does it cost to issue an order of protection against someone with a proven history of abuse?" said the county's District Attorney, Jeanine Pirro, who was chairwoman of Gov. George E. Pataki's Commission on Domestic Violence Fatalities and presented the commission's report to him last year.
Mrs. Uguna sought protection from the courts for the last time on Aug. 19. In 1996 she obtained a court order of protection against her husband, but it had lapsed. The police said also that an earlier assault charge filed against Mr. Uguna was dropped when Mrs. Uguna failed to pursue the case. And two days before Mrs. Uguna sought help for the last time, her husband was jailed on drunken-driving charges in Tarrytown, Detective Frank Corona of the Sleepy Hollow Police Department said.
"The bottom line is that we have a court system that is supposed to help victims, and it turned away Hilda Uguna," Mrs. Pirro said.
For many, the Uguna case has stirred memories of another case in which the victim was also legally unable to keep her husband out of the house. Anne Scripps Douglas, the newspaper heiress, was beaten into a coma with a hammer allegedly by her estranged husband on Dec. 31, 1993, in her Bronxville home. She died six days later. The car of her husband, Scott Douglas, was discovered on the Tappan Zee Bridge that night, a bloody hammer inside. His body washed ashore along the Hudson River almost three months later.
In that case, too, criticism of the court system followed the crime. The New Rochelle Family Court and Judge Ingrid S. Braslow were faulted by social workers and lawyers for issuing an order of protection to the victim but not ordering Mr. Douglas to leave the house.
After that case and responding to a growing concern about domestic violence, the County Board of Legislators issued a report in 1995 stating that one in four women in Westchester are abused by their spouses or companions.
Last year, Governor Pataki signed legislation to protect victims of domestic violence by insuring that they are not arrested for defending themselves from attack. The Primary Aggressor legislation requires that the police arrest only the main attacker.
Despite efforts to thwart such crimes, domestic violence remains the leading cause of injury to women, according to the United States Surgeon General's office.
Recently in Westchester, there have been some dramatic cases of abuse that resulted in death, the ones -- as Mr. Scheinkman, the County Attorney, said -- that attract public attention. Early on Dec. 6, 1997, Patrick J. Biller, a 53-year-old Yonkers man described by neighbors as quick-tempered and troubled by health problems, finances and apparently a failing marriage, shot his wife, Maureen, and three children to death and then killed himself in the family's apartment.
In Tarrytown, Anthony Ambrosovitch, 65, a former police officer, has been charged in connection with the June 11 shooting deaths of his wife, Gloria, and a daughter, Melinda Podesta. Mr. Ambrosovitch, neighbors said, had a history of alcohol abuse and family difficulties. In a dramatic standoff, he held the police at bay for more than four hours after the killings.
In the county, law-enforcement officials and social workers are studying three main aspects of the domestic violence problem: obtaining orders of protection, enforcing those orders and helping abusers control their problems.
Judge Scancarelli said that too often women come to court unable to understand the application requirements. "If I had a wish to make," she said, "it would be that there was always an attorney present to help with petitions and court processes."
Lawyers from the domestic violence unit of Westchester Putnam Legal Services are working with law students at Pace University to help victims file applications for orders of protection, Amy Saltzman, a staff lawyer for Legal Services, said. "There are too many unrepresented litigants," she said. "We have to get them when they walk through the door and help them to follow through in the courts."
At the county's Department of Probation, Commissioner Rocco A. Pozzi said officers have been assigned to oversee orders of protection and arrest those who violate them so the documents do not become "just pieces of paper."
Batterers who do not obey the order issued against them are subject to arrest. "We're not talking about a slap on the wrist," the Commissioner said.
To help abusers control their behavior, both the Probation Department and the Mental Health Association of Westchester County run workshops.
"There are a lot of theories about why men batter," said Jennifer Brennan, director of outpatient mental health services at the Mental Health Association in Elmsford. "These are complicated issues."
Studies show that for the most part men are the abusers, but women sometimes batter their spouses or elderly parents.
Dr. Neil Jacobson and Dr. John Gottman, two professors of psychology at the University of Washington who have studied violent marriages, are the authors of "When Men Batter Women" (Simon and Schuster). In the book, they say that batterers fall into two categories: pit bulls or cobras. The former tend to be charmers until they enter into an intimate relationship. Then they act out of emotional dependence and a fear of abandonment, becoming stalkers and jealous partners. For example, the book puts O. J. Simpson in the category of a pit bull.
Cobras, on the other hand, are often sociopaths who are cold and calculating and demonstrate a high incidence of antisocial and criminal traits and sadistic behavior, the researchers found. A cobra's violence grows out of a pathological need to have one's way, to be the boss and make sure that everyone, particularly their wives and girlfriends, knows it and acts accordingly.
Ms. Brennan at the Mental Health Association observed that before 1977 it was not illegal for a man to assault a partner. She said her organization does not report more domestic violence in any particular socio-economic group. "Very poor and very wealthy women become victims," she said.
But results of studies distributed by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, a nonprofit advocacy organization in Washington, indicate some differences among ethnic groups. Black women, the Network reported, are more likely to feel protective of the batterer because he may have faced discrimination and other difficulties.
Also, battered Hispanic women in shelters are more likely to have experienced a longer duration of abuse, be married at a younger age, have larger families and have stayed in relationships longer, the studies revealed.

HEADLINE: For Sale: Free Software;
Backers of Linux Say System Is Basis For Revolutionizing Computer Business

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C.

 BODY:
In an experiment that is half business model and half populist movement, a small company called Red Hat Software is charging $50 for an operating system called Linux that anyone can get free on the Internet, and it is paying programmers decent wages to write code that it will give away.
While that might seem the most contrarian of business plans, Red Hat is attracting blue-chip investors to the notion that free can be profitable. 
 The movement, known alternately as free software and open source, is built around freely distributing source code, the basic commands that programmers write. Publishing these instructions before they are compiled into the binary language of computers offers other programmers the chance to examine the code and suggest or actually write improvements.
At its best, the movement's proponents say, open source could harness the collective wisdom of the world's best software designers for social good, undermine the Microsoft Corporation's Windows monopoly and propagate an operating system that does not crash.
A great deal of their passion is inspired by Linux, a version of the Unix operating system developed by Linus Torvalds of Finland and numerous collaborators worldwide. Linux (rhymes with "cynics") has attracted a cult-like following among programmers and systems developers who say it is a more secure, flexible and economic alternative to Microsoft's industrial-strength operating system, Windows NT.
Despite that kind of following, the business-model half of the Red Hat experiment strikes many people as counterintuitive.
Robert F. Young, the chief executive of the three-year-old company in Durham's Research Triangle Park, insists that open-source products can make money. And although he has nothing against contributing to a utopian vision of software development in the process, his pragmatic focus has lately attracted interest from venture capitalists and corporate backers.
"The software industry is built on intellectual property," said Mr. Young, a 44-year-old Canadian who used to run a computer leasing business. "You own your technology, and if you get it widely disseminated you can coerce your user base into buying new releases. We give up that control -- and those profits -- but that is exactly what is going to drive our success, because that is what's best for the user."
Among Red Hat's potential corporate backers are the Intel Corporation and the Netscape Communications Corporation. An announcement is expected as early as tomorrow, when Mr. Young is scheduled to appear with executives from both companies in San Jose, Calif.
Such support, particularly from Intel, whose close ties to Microsoft have recently shown signs of fraying, would lend considerable credibility both to Linux and to Red Hat's plans to build a business by providing customer service and technical support for the free operating system.
Recent support for Linux and other open-source projects seems to suggest a growing acceptance in the software industry of an alternative to the tradition of proprietary code.
I.B.M., for example, recently licensed Apache, a popular program for serving up World Wide Web sites. Like Linux, Apache is a free, open-source product.
And Netscape last February published the source code to its Navigator browser for navigating the World Wide Web. Forced to stop charging for Navigator by Microsoft's free distribution of its competing brower software, Explorer, Netscape gambled that going one step further and releasing its code would give Navigator a competitive advantage over Explorer in the long run by spurring innovation.
"Open source has already radically changed the computer industry," said Tim O'Reilly, whose publishing company, O'Reilly & Associates, makes money producing user manuals for free software. "In the first round, open-source software will not beat Microsoft at its own game. What it is doing is changing the nature of the game."
Mr. Torvalds, who wrote Linux in 1991 when he was a student at the University of Helsinki, licensed it in a way that allows anyone to submit improved code and redistribute it at will. Since then, thousands of programmers have volunteered elaborate improvements of their own design for no more reward than the respect of the geek subculture.
Submissions to Linux's core code, or kernel, are subjected to instantaneous electronic peer review, a technological meritocracy that has so far insulated Linux from the kind of fragmentation that has befallen other operating systems built around the international Unix standard.
Despite the operating system's reputation for power and reliability, corporations have been reluctant to use Linux because nobody owns it. That is why the emergence of companies like Red Hat and Caldera Systems Inc. -- a Linux distributor with a business plan based on corporate training, services and support -- is considered crucial to the success of the free operating system.
Now, bolstered by commitments from companies like Oracle, Netscape, Intel, Informix and Corel, all of whom have announced plans to support Linux in recent months, Red Hat and Caldera are getting more aggressive.
But their business plans are fragile. For instance, since Red Hat wants whatever code it writes to become part of the Linux kernel, it must be published under open-source rules. That means that www.cheapbytes.com can, and does, sell Red Hat's entire Linux package for $1.99 -- $48.01 less than Red Hat's customers pay.
Red Hat's Mr. Young estimates that as few as 1 in 10 of the people who use Red Hat have paid him for it. But that is one of the paradoxical pillars of charging only for support and services, not for intellectual property.
"My job is not to compete with Microsoft," Mr. Young stresses. "It's to lower the value of the operating system market. Microsoft makes $5 billion in operating system sales. If I get that market, I automatically make it a $500 million market."
Skeptics are quick to note that the technology companies lining up behind Linux, with its estimated seven million users, have their own competitive reasons to oppose Microsoft, which has 300 million users for its Windows operating systems.
What is more, the skeptics point out, no one knows how long Linux's labor-of-love development by programmers will last.
"An operating system is a living thing," said Carl Shapiro, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley and a co-author of "Information Rules," a book to be published this week by the Harvard Business School Press. "Ongoing investment and upgrades are essential to attract customers. Nice cooperative thoughts are not enough."
Still, use of Linux is growing by more than 40 percent a year, according to IDC, a research firm. And a 1997 survey by another research firm, Datapro, found that Linux scored higher with users than any other operating system. Dell Computer, which last year began offering Linux to customers who ordered at least 50 computers a quarter, said that more interest had been expressed in Linux in recent months.
James Love, director of Ralph Nader's Consumer Project on Technology, which has encouraged the Justice Department to investigate Microsoft's Windows licensing deals with computer manufacturers, said his office had found it impossible to buy Linux already installed on a PC from a major commercial vendor. But he managed to install it on his own computer, and he was impressed.
"This is the first time we've seen an industrial-strength product developed without a corporation behind it, and we think it's amazing" Mr. Love said. "If the operating system is in fact a natural monopoly, then what could be better than having an operating system that nobody owns?"
No one argues that Linux poses a threat to Microsoft right now. But at a time when the next version of Windows NT appears indefinitely delayed by a complexity that has grown unmanageable, Linux enthusiasts are beginning to find back-door ways to introduce the operating system into their corporations.
For example, when Randy Kessel, a manager for technical analysis for Southwestern Bell, part of SBC Communications, installed Red Hat's Linux on the 36 desktop personal computers that monitor network operations in Kansas and Missouri, it was done on something of a dare.
After poor results testing a memory-intensive application with Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT, a colleague asked Mr. Kessel why, if he thought Linux was so great, he did not try it.
"So we took a mission-critical operation and we deployed a free operating system there," Mr. Kessel said. "And now we spend a tenth of the administration cost for those desktops that we do for the rest of the 315 we use."
Even so, he met resistance.
"The legal department says, 'When it fails, who do we sue?' " he said. "The I.T. department says, 'It's not a proved product.' Corporate security says, 'It's hackerware.' But it's the only thing that worked."
Other recent Linux converts include the movie director James Cameron's special-effects company, Digital Domain, which used the operating system to help create the illusions in "Titanic."
And when the city of Medina, Wash., was overwhelmed by documents -- including the four file cabinets filled with paperwork on the mansion built by Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates -- it installed an electronic document retrieval system that runs on Linux.
Ray A. Jones, president of Archive Retrieval, which installed the system for Medina, said he was aware of an irony in his choice of an operating system. But he recalled feeling vindicated when a bug arose in the scanning process.
"We asked a question on the Internet, and within a couple of hours we had an answer," Mr. Jones said. "I fixed it myself with three lines of code. With a commercial product I'd have had to wait for Microsoft to fix it -- if it ever did. This way, the whole Linux community benefited."
Marc Ewing, 29, who started Red Hat in 1995 because he found downloading the various pieces of Linux a major headache, said developing software in isolation -- without public contributions -- "would be like typing with one arm."
And yet for Linux to ever compete with Windows, it must be easier to use. Now users must control Linux with a complicated syntax of arcane commands. So Mr. Ewing oversees six programmers working on a project called Gnome, an effort to hide the nuts and bolts of the operating system behind the kind of graphical interface familiar to users of Macintosh or Windows machines.
While they sleep, other groups elsewhere in the world are getting up to work on Gnome. Often by the next morning, someone will have translated the code into Portuguese.
But Mr. Torvalds, who now works for a chip design company in Silicon Valley, insists that the true strength of an operating system is reliability.
"You use a Windows machine and the golden rule is: Save, and save often," Mr. Torvalds said. "It's scary how people have grown used to the idea that computers are unreliable when it is not the computer at all -- it's the operating system that just doesn't cut it."

HEADLINE: Senate May Vote on Financial Services Bill

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
For nearly two decades, efforts to lift Depression-era regulations on the nation's financial services industry have come to no avail. But that may end this week, as a measure to modernize the industry, one long written off as dead, is showing remarkable signs of life in the Senate.
The financial services businesses lobbied heavily late last week and over the weekend, as the Senate prepared to vote this week on the measure, which would make it easier for banks, brokers and insurance companies to merge into huge financial conglomerates. By last count, it appeared that the Senate leadership was close to corralling the 60 votes needed to cut off any filibuster and allow for a floor vote on the bill. 
 In the meantime, compromises carefully worked out between insurance agents, consumer groups, Wall Street executives and bankers appeared to be holding, though some outstanding issues remained to be resolved. "The odds are favoring getting the bill to the floor and it passing," said Kenneth Guenther, lobbyist for the Independent Bankers Association of America.
The bill would put into law what the marketplace, in large part, is already doing: It would provide for the creation of huge financial conglomerates able to underwrite securities, sell insurance and take bank deposits, all under one roof. It would do so by overturning the Glass-Steagall Act, written during the Depression, and the Bank Holding Company Act, written in the 1950's, that erected walls between commercial and investment banking.
The House passed this measure by a single vote in May, and its backers are racing to gain Senate approval before Congress adjourns in October. "Time is our main enemy right now," a Wall Street lobbyist said.
Senate leaders are trying to work out as many problems as possible so the bill can be considered on the floor with few disruptions. At the same time, the lobbying machine is cranking up: Merrill Lynch & Company is planning radio ads in Washington on the morning Don Imus program; insurance agents across the country plan to work on grass-roots telephone banks, and a letter has been sent by 50 top financial executives to all Senators warning of dire financial consquences if the bill is not passed.
"We simply must modernize our own financial system," the letter says, "if America is going to credibly advocate financial sector reform in Japan, Southeast Asia and other parts of the world."
Those signing it included Jon Corzine of Goldman, Sachs; Harvey Golub of American Express; Richard Grasso of the New York Stock Exchange and David H. Komansky of Merrill Lynch.
The main opposition appears to be led by Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, who opposes expansion of Government requirements that financial services companies provide low-cost banking services to low- and moderate-income consumers. He has threatened to "body block" the bill with a filibuster, several lobbyists say, if it is not modified.
Other issues still in play include a provision that would prevent savings and loans from being sold to commercial businesses; Washington Mutual, the largest savings and loan, is leading a battle against this. Efforts are also under way to smooth out a dispute between banks and insurance agents over the regulation of bank sales of insurance products.
A big obstacle to the bill's becoming law is a threatened veto by President Clinton over a provision that favors the Federal Reserve in the financial regulatory structure at the expense of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a branch of the Treasury Department.
But many say that Mr. Clinton will be hard pressed to make good on that threat because of current global economic turmoil. And amid impeachment talk, the President needs the support of Congressional Democrats who are behind the measure.
If the bill clears the Senate, it would land on the President's desk just about the time a meeting of international central bankers called by the Fed and the Treasury Department to address the global financial crisis convenes in Washington.
One of its main topics is a push by American officials for other countries to modernize their financial services industries -- making it difficult for Mr. Clinton to veto a bill to do just that in the United States. "How can the President veto the bill while asking others to modernize their financial systems," a banking lobbyist said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "It would undermine our ability to restore world financial confidence."

HEADLINE: For G.O.P., Rare Hope in Boulder

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: BOULDER, Colo., Sept. 27

 BODY:
Could Boulder, the liberal lighthouse of the Rockies, send to Congress -- a Republican?
For nearly a quarter-century, Colorado's Second District has been a safe seat for Democrats -- and an altar for Republican sacrificial lambs. The last Republican candidate to run from this district, Pat Miller, vowed to be the "voice" of paramilitary groups in Congress. 
 But now the Republicans have fielded Robert D. Greenlee, a moderate who favors abortion rights and enjoys a wide following as Boulder's first Republican Mayor since 1971. A self-made millionaire, Mr. Greenlee, 57, has deep pockets to finance his campaign.
For the Democrats, Mark Udall, who is in his first term as a State Representative, is mounting what appears to be an equally strong candidacy. An heir to the Udall Western political legacy forged by his father, Morris, a former Congressman, and uncle, Stewart, who was Interior Secretary as well as a Congressman, the 48-year-old candidate enjoys fervent support from local and national environmental groups. An avid mountain climber in a district where outdoor recreation is king, Mr. Udall directed the Colorado Outward Bound School for a decade.
Among Colorado's six House races this year, this is the only one seen as truly competitive.
"You have two of the most progressive people in state politics running against each other," said Timothy Wirth, a liberal Democrat who represented this district from 1974 to 1986. "It's now going to be an extremely interesting race."
Both national parties focused on the district immediately after David E. Skaggs, the Democratic Representative, announced last year that he would not run for re-election after completing this term, his sixth. A liberal stalwart of the House, Mr. Skaggs has received a near-perfect voting rating from liberal groups.
The Republicans took aim at the seat, noting it was 1 of only 16 nationwide where Democratic incumbents were not seeking re-election. The Democrat Party is determined to hold on to the seat.
"It's a race we are pretty excited about," said Thomas E. Eisenhauer, a political strategist from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, who traveled from Washington to attend a debate between the two candidates on Wednesday. "Mark is a really strong candidate who proved in the primary he can raise money."
Mr. Udall was a long shot this year when he won a crowded primary, defeating better known candidates in Colorado.
"Udall's image is not of a strict Democratic partisan, but much more of a thinking environmentalist," said Floyd Ciruli, president of a polling and political consulting company in Denver. "Udall not only has the cachet of the name, but also the ability to raise money around the nation."
That ability is a special asset in this race, said Mr. Ciruli, who predicted that it would be the most expensive House campaign in Colorado history, costing about $2 million.
The district centered in Boulder is no longer a safe seat for Democrats for several reasons. The seven states sharing the Rocky Mountain time zone arguably now make up the nation's most consistently Republican region, with only three Democrats serving in the House -- Representatives Skaggs, Diana DeGette of Colorado's First District, which includes Denver, and Ed Pastor of Arizona's Second District. With the exception of New Mexico, all the states have legislatures controlled by Republicans.
Over the last decade in Colorado, Republicans have become the party with the largest number of registered voters, 35 percent to the Democrats' 30 percent. In that time, the Congressional delegation has shifted from an even balance to 6-2 favoring the Republicans. In the Second District, once firmly Democratic, voter registration gives the party only a small edge over the Republicans, 32 percent to 30 percent. The rest are independents.
Democratic control of the seat here dates to 1974, when the party's candidates were swept into office around the nation, riding a wave of anger over Watergate and President Richard M. Nixon, who had just resigned.
"There really is a parallel, but I don't think that Clinton's problems resonate in the same way that Nixon's problems resonated with the voting public," said Paul Talmey, president of a Boulder polling company. "Today, the world is at peace, the economy is doing well."
In the hourlong debate and question-and-answer session on Wednesday, the subject of President Clinton's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky never came up.
"That was a very good sign today," Mr. Udall said after the debate. "Last night, I was out knocking on doors, and it came up a few times. Mostly to say, 'We are sick of it.' "
Before the debate, Mr. Greenlee said: "I don't intend on using it in my campaign. But it's like a 350-pound gorilla. It's out there."
Addressing a business audience, Mr. Greenlee painted himself as an entrepreneur who had started 12 businesses and fought government regulations. He called for overhauling the Internal Revenue Service, paying down the national debt, instituting a system in which government vouchers could be used to pay for private schooling, and giving more opportunities to people in contrast to the government.
He stressed his success in building two of the Denver area's largest radio stations and a major restaurant chain. Apparently out of deference to the religious right, his campaign literature does not mention that he also is a major investor in Colorado's largest casino.
In a deliberate appeal to the lesser-known side of the Second District, Mr. Greenlee has placed his campaign headquarters not in Boulder but in Broomfield, a fast-growing suburb where high-technology companies are setting up shop.
Asked about initiatives to censor Internet content, Mr. Greenlee responded in almost a libertarian fashion, saying, "The freer the better."
In November, Coloradans are to vote on an initiative that would make Broomfield the state's first new county in 85 years.
Voting registration records in the Second District show that more newcomers are registering Republican than Democrat.
Mr. Udall, aware that the district is still dominated by the University of Colorado's largest campus, called for strengthening public education.
In the debate, Mr. Udall came off as a more polished campaigner than his opponent, who has served on the Boulder City Council for the last 15 years. While answering questions from the audience, Mr. Udall managed to tip his hat to two locally prominent Democrats attending the debate, a County Attorney and a State Senator, and to mention that his 74-year-old mother, Pat, is a Colorado native and a resident of Boulder.
No opinion polls have been taken in the race, and it is unclear who has the advantage.
"I am a lifelong Democrat, but for the first time in my life, I don't know who I will vote for," said Russell E. Shaw, a systems theory consultant who attended the debate. "They are offering different philosophies. Udall is trying to fix things. Greenlee is trying to empower citizens, instead of the government."

In This Vote, You Can Take Manhattan

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
WOULD a "real mensch" trash Manhattan to curry favor in Munnsville?
Would a genuine champion of upstate interests embrace Ed (Rural Life Is a Joke) Koch? 
 The answer, New York State Democrats insist, is no on both counts. Hence their highly unorthodox step of promising to buy air time to rebroadcast Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's own advertisements.
Last week, Democrats announced plans to run an ad in upstate media markets that the Republican Senator himself has broadcast exclusively over New York City airwaves. In this ad, Mr. Koch and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani put aside their differences to praise the Senator, calling him a "real mensch."
Downstate, meanwhile, the Democrats say they plan to rebroadcast a commercial created by the state Republican Party for upstate viewing only. This ad depicts city Democrats, quite literally, as rapacious sharks gobbling up tax dollars.
"We are exposing downstaters to what Republicans have to say about them when they think they are not listening," said the state Democratic chairwoman, Judith Hope, who called the shark ad "very cynical and even offensive."
By running the two ads in media markets where they were most certainly not intended to be shown -- or at least by talking about doing so -- Democrats hope to dramatize internal contradictions in the Senator's campaign. In effect, they are betting that Mr. D'Amato has miscalculated, pushing too hard -- and too early -- on the old upstate-downstate rivalries.
But the last few elections also suggest that the risk Mr. D'Amato is taking in alienating city voters may well be worth it.
City residents tend to imagine that they live at the center of the world, to say nothing of the state. And while the city's influence, in cultural and economic terms, is disproportionately large, its influence in electoral politics is just the reverse.
A half-century ago, city voters made up half the state's electorate. Today, they make up just over a third. And even that figure overstates their significance, with a consistently low voter turnout rate.
Four years ago, for example, when George E. Pataki was a little-known State Senator running against Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, two-thirds of all registered voters outside the city went to the polls. But within the city, fewer than half did. Had the city's turnout been comparable to the rest of the state's, Mr. Cuomo would almost certainly still be Governor, while Mr. Pataki would be a little-known former State Senator.
Four years before that, when Mr. Cuomo ran against the much-ridiculed Pierre Rinfret, only 37 percent of the city's registered voters went to the polls, while outside the city, 57 percent did. That year, Mr. Cuomo was pushing a $2 billion environmental bond act that was defeated largely because of voter apathy in the five boroughs.
EXPERTS cite many factors in the low city turnout, most significantly demography. "By and large," said Frances Fox Piven, a professor of political science at the City University's Graduate Center, "the pattern for fully a century now is that if you have less income, less education and are a member of a minority group, the less likely you are to turn out."
According to Ms. Piven, politicians could draw more city voters to the polls if they focused on the right issues, like income inequality, unemployment and health care access. The problem for Democrats, obviously, is that these are precisely the kind of issues associated with good old-fashioned New York City liberalism. Thus, they are precisely the kind of issues that can be used to galvanize opposition upstate.
If the last two gubernatorial elections are a guide, city residents will cast somewhere between 25 and 30 percent of the vote this November, a significant figure to be sure but hardly decisive.
So while it may be unseemly for Mr. D'Amato, himself Nassau County-bred, to attack his Democratic opponent, Representative Charles E. Schumer, for his New York City roots, it is quite logical for him to do.
In a D'Amato ad that the Democrats have decided not to rebroadcast, a large saw cuts the state in two while an announcer warns voters of Mr. Schumer's metro centrism. "Liberal Brooklyn Congressman Chuck Schumer doesn't think upstate New York matters," the narrator intones.
Perhaps the sharpest irony of the Republican strategy is that in statewide elections, it is increasingly New York City that doesn't matter.

HEADLINE: Germany Turns the Page

 BODY:
A German politician once said of Chancellor Helmut Kohl that if he had been the Titanic, the iceberg would have sunk. So it seemed for 16 years as Mr. Kohl barreled over one opponent after another to lead Germany for longer than any man since Otto von Bismarck a century ago. But the Kohl winning streak was broken yesterday, and with it ended one of the most eventful and fateful periods in postwar German and European history.
Mr. Kohl deftly directed the peaceful reunification of Germany, helped fashion the political architecture for a united Europe and led the way to economic cooperation on the continent and the adoption of a common currency. In Germany itself he instilled a sense of confidence and accomplishment that helped overcome the burden of Germany's role in World War II and the Holocaust. 
 German unification was Mr. Kohl's singular achievement, even if it turned out to be one of the causes of his defeat. It is easy now to look back on the absorption of East Germany as a smooth, peaceful process. But as the Berlin wall fell and the cold war ended in the late 1980's, reunification seemed fraught with peril for Germany and for Europe. With the assistance of Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow and George Bush in Washington, Mr. Kohl reunited the two Germanys democratically and made his country the anchor of peace and prosperity in Europe.
The financial cost of propping up eastern Germany was far greater than Mr. Kohl expected, and the sluggish growth and high unemployment it produced in recent years fanned dissatisfaction with Mr. Kohl. But after four terms, Mr. Kohl, who is 68, was defeated less by specific complaints than by a desire for new, younger leadership.
Mr. Kohl's departure portends no great change in Germany's relations with Europe, the United States and the rest of the world. It may not even mean much alteration in domestic policy, though power will now pass to a more left-leaning Government led by Gerhard Schroder and the Social Democratic Party. A radical student leader in the 1960's, Mr. Schroder, who is 54, long ago found his place in the German mainstream and campaigned as a pragmatic centrist.
His biggest challenge will be to deal with the economic drag produced by Germany's generous social welfare programs. Mr. Kohl tinkered with the system by curtailing a few benefits, but Mr. Schroder showed no inclination during the campaign to reform the long annual vacations, extended sick leave and other programs that Germans consider to be their birthright. Mr. Schroder also ought to make Germany's immigrants feel more welcome and make it easier for them to become citizens, an area in which Mr. Kohl often played to nationalist sentiments. Political and financial power in Germany is passing to a new generation. It will be measured against the Kohl legacy.

HEADLINE: Sharks in the Senate Race

 BODY:
Alfonse D'Amato, who represents New York in the United States Senate, appears to be planning a re-election campaign aimed at increasing the tensions and distrust between its residents. That is a remarkable conception of what it means to be a statewide elected official.
Mr. D'Amato's latest television ads against his Democratic opponent, Representative Charles Schumer, claim that because Mr. Schumer comes from Brooklyn, he "doesn't think upstate New York matters." Meanwhile, the state Republican Party is running similar commercials that depict New York City politicians as sharks, swimming up the Hudson to steal money from helpless upstate taxpayers. "They're back," says an announcer to music from the movie "Jaws." "New York City liberals have plans for higher taxes and higher spending, and you know what that means -- higher taxes for us, more spending for them." The Republicans are playing to a suspicion, long encouraged by upstate politicians, that the city is a drain on their economy, gobbling up far more than its share of resources. In truth, the city has been the economic engine for the state, and the real beneficiaries of an imbalance between taxes and spending are the small rural towns upstate, which are extremely dependent on state jobs and state aid paid for by all New York taxpayers. 
 No one should begrudge helping these needy towns, and if the political culture of New York were not so impaired, the state would have long since resolved some of the problems that have kept it lagging behind most of the rest of the country in job growth. But the mutual distrust between upstate New Yorkers and New York City is a political cancer that has laid waste to the state's government. The Legislature flounders perpetually because its members believe they were sent to Albany to champion their regions rather than work for the well-being of the entire state. Lawmakers have never been able to agree on sacrifice for the common good because in New York's warped political culture there is no common good, only a never-ending struggle to grab more for your own side.
The governor serves as the only real symbol of a unified New York, and it is incredible that Gov. George Pataki, the party's standard-bearer, would allow his party to run ads that aim at turning one part of the state against another. Mr. Pataki is well ahead in the polls and nurtures national ambitions, and his own ads are mainly feel-good paeans to his virtues. He cannot really believe he needs to run against New York City in order to be re-elected, but he cannot dodge responsibility for divisive commercials that are being paid for by his party on behalf of his ticket.
Playing the "liberal New York City politicians" card upstate is an easy dodge that transfers voter discontent away from local politicians and dumps it on a scapegoat far away. Mr. D'Amato did not invent the tactic, but he is perhaps the first official who actually represents New York City residents to use it against his own constituents.

HEADLINE: Making Do With Supplies, Dominican Republic Struggles to Rebuild

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER and RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Under a blazing Caribbean sun that made him squint as he worked, Rafael Dennis began trying to rebuild his mother's little wood-frame house this morning.
It was not going to be an easy job. 
 Like hundreds of thousands of people here in the Dominican Republic whose homes were blown down or damaged when Hurricane Georges struck last Tuesday, Mr. Dennis, in one of the hardest-hit areas, had almost nothing to work with. No lumber, no roofing materials. Not even nails.
Yet, with much of the wreckage of the storm cleared away, Mr. Dennis and many of the others were salvaging rusty nails, unbroken boards and anything else they could find to piece their homes back together. In every neighborhood, it seemed, men were up on ladders, balanced on roofs with hammers and saws flashing in the sun, as the country struggled to rebuild.
Mr. Dennis and some of the others said they hoped the Government would send trucks with corrugated tin for roofs. But they also knew that the authorities had been preoccupied with opening roads, restoring electricity and searching for missing people.
And although relief supplies have begun to arrive from abroad, many of the country's eight million people have yet to receive any help. Moreover, people who have tried to buy supplies say some merchants have doubled their prices.
For some Dominicans the worst of Hurricane Georges is still not over. Adriano Tejada, the chief spokesman for President Leonel Fernandez, said that at least a handful of towns and villages north and west of the capital were still cut off by flood waters. The Government shipped food to a staging point near some of those places, but it was not clear whether it reached the final destinations.
Government officials have reported 201 deaths, mainly from flooding and mudslides, but Hugh Parmer, a Texas lawyer who is now in charge of humanitarian aid for the United States Agency for International Development, said in an interview here that as many as 200 more might be dead.
While the Dominican Government has not yet issued an estimate of the cost of the destruction, Mr. Parmer said he expected it to run to about $3 billion, or about $500 million more than the nation's entire operating budget for this year. Officials have estimated the hurricane damage in Puerto Rico at $2 billion. One reason losses there were lower, Mr. Parmer said, was that Puerto Rico appeared to have been better prepared.
Four United States Representatives, led by Elton Gallegly, Republican of California, the chairman of the subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs, flew in from Puerto Rico this afternoon to talk with President Fernandez and other officials and visit a shelter for storm victims. As they were leaving a few hours later, Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, said he would support an increase in aid for the Dominican Republic.
Mr. Parmer said the United States had spent about $500,000 in the relief effort here so far, and it expected to spend up to several million dollars altogether.
Dominican newspapers have reported that the hurricane caught many Dominicans by surprise and the newspapers have criticized the Government, saying that it failed to issue adequate warnings. This morning, one of the leading newspapers, Listin Diario, quoted Nicolas de Jesus Cardinal Lopez Rodriguez, the Roman Catholic Archbishop, as saying the Government's lack of preparation had contributed to the nation's losses. Responding earlier to the newspapers, Elpedio Baez, the Dominican Civil Defense director, said he believed that the criticism was politically motivated.
Mr. Parmer said Dominican officials had privately conceded to him that they "just underestimated the impact" of the hurricane.
"It's been 20 years since they've had a bad storm like this," he said. "It's human nature that when something happens that long ago, you forget."
San Pedro de Macoris, overlooking the Caribbean 32 miles west of the capital city of Santo Domingo, had the misfortune of being directly in the path of the hurricane as it steered a deadly course along the southern coast before veering inland and tearing across Haiti, the Dominican Republic's neighbor on the island of Hispaniola.
San Pedro is a city of more than 100,000 people, mostly poor and working class, dominated by sugar mills and dreams of big league baseball. It is the home of Sammy Sosa and scores of other baseball stars. Even in their misery, nearly everyone seemed to be thinking today of the Chicago Cubs slugger as he battled to become the home run king.
"It is great to see a fellow Dominican with such stature," said Efrain Vasquez, a 29-year-old factory worker, as he sat on a stone bench in the small plaza known as Central Park.
The hurricane jabbed and punched at this entire city. But the most crippling blows fell on the poorest people whose homes, like those of Mr. Dennis and his mother, had been fine shelters from the sun and the usual tropical downpours but were no match for the 110-mile-per-hour gusts of Hurricane Georges.
Juana Garcia lives in a neighborhood of small wood and concrete-block houses, Barrio Blanco, along the eastern bank of the Higamo River. She and her six children figured they would ride out the storm in their two-room concrete-block house. But as the winds began to shake the house, they ran to a neighbor's bigger house, higher up the bank. When the winds died down, all that was left of Ms. Garcia's house was the front wall and half of another.
At the white-washed, colonial-style Cathedral of San Pedro, homeless families have set up house in the pews. And they are pretty much on their own. Miguelina Contrera, a widow who ran to the church when the calm eye of the storm passed over, after the windows in her house had been blown out and the roof torn off, said that neither the Government nor the church had offered the refugees anything but shelter.
Besides the clothes she and her daughters, ages 2 and 9, were wearing, they had only a garbage bag with two thin blankets and a couple of shirts. Beside them was a plastic motor oil jug with water that Ms. Contrera said was not fit to drink.
In the city's industrial park, where row after row of low-rising factories produce things like clothing and simple medical equipment, tractor-trailers still lay on their sides today as workers patched roofs and tried to get drenched machinery working.
Working on his mother's home today, Mr. Dennis said he was not sure where or when he would get his hands on the lumber and roofing supplies he needed. But, he said, he thought he had salvaged enough to finish at least a single room so she could stop living with relatives.
"I have to do this," he said. "I feel bad because she's lost everything."

HEADLINE: Calculated Risk: U.S. and I.M.F. Lead Push for Brazil Bailout Plan

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
With the Clinton Administration and the International Monetary Fund taking the lead, a package of loans for Brazil, likely to total more than $30 billion, is gradually being put together to limit the damage to Latin America's biggest economy from the Asian crisis. But the bailout plan is a calculated risk: rather than save Brazil, it could sink the country into deep recession.
The stakes for Americans are considerable. The huge Brazilian economy dominates Latin America, which purchases nearly 20 percent of America's exports and is host to thousands of American-owned factories, whose sales and profits contribute significantly to corporate America's bottom line. A sharp cutback in the flow of all this income, coming on top of a similar blow from the Asian crisis, might reduce economic growth in the United States to a crawl. 
 Now that Asia and Russia have been flattened, Brazil is suddenly the new front line in the struggle to halt the spreading financial crisis, with its power to pull down markets and plunge countries into recession. If Brazil goes down, then Europe or the United States would become the next battlegrounds.
"It is very clear from the statements being made by top officials in the Clinton Administration that Brazil is fundamental to the system," said Desmond Lachman, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney, a Wall Street firm with money at risk in Brazil. "There is just no way they can allow Brazil to fail."
The whole purpose of the proposed loan package is to preserve the present value of the Brazilian currency -- the real -- to avoid the steep devaluations that have been so ruinous in Asia.
Because Brazil spends much more on imports than it earns from exports, it must finance overseas purchases by continually borrowing money abroad.
That is not easy, given that foreign lenders are increasingly nervous about putting money into any country showing signs of difficulty. Since mid-summer, those lenders have gradually withdrawn money from Brazil.
The hope is that the huge loan package will reverse these withdrawals, particularly if it is combined with austerity measures already begun by Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Confidence in the Brazilian economy would revive and fresh foreign money would enter the country.
But obstacles are looming. The United States Government, for example, might take part in the proposed loan package. But rather than ask Congress for the money, the Administration might ask the Federal Reserve to make the loan from its resources, or it might tap the same emergency fund that it used in 1994 to help Mexico through its crisis.
Both possibilities are reported to have arisen in the preliminary discussions. And both are likely to draw the ire of Republicans, who challenged the Administration in 1994 for risking taxpayer money without Congressional approval.
Private lenders are also being asked to take part, and some are clearly reluctant. "Anything that boosts confidence in emerging markets we would regard as positive," said Andrew Tuck, a Chase Manhattan spokesman. "But as far as stepping up to the plate and putting up more money, we have $4.3 billion outstanding in Brazil already, and we cannot dig into our pockets every time someone asks for a handout."
The proposed package would be openly negotiated only after the presidential election in Brazil next Sunday, and only if -- as expected -- Mr. Cardoso is re-elected. Nevertheless, a senior Clinton Administration official acknowledged on Friday that active discussions are already in progress with the Brazilians, the I.M.F., other governments and private lenders.
He added, however, that "the speculation about the contents of a package are way ahead of reality."
The preliminary package, according to interviews with people involved in the talks, has taken this form: The I.M.F. would put up $10 billion or so, borrowing the money itself if its existing reserve is inadequate. The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank would add roughly $5 billion apiece. The governments of the largest industrial countries, or some of them, would contribute sizable, but so far unspecified, amounts. And when these loans were in place, the private lenders, as a demonstration of their confidence in Brazil, would agree to roll over existing loans, and add roughly $10 billion.
Still, a giant loan package may not be sufficient to save the Brazilian economy, even if it is combined with the sort of cutbacks in spending that President Cardoso has already begun.
The Brazilian real must also be devalued, this argument goes, by 15 percent or more.
The reason is that the real is over-valued. An American-made toothbrush, for example, that sells in the United States for perhaps $1, sells in Brazil for the equivalent of 75 cents, while a Brazilian-made toothbrush sells in both Brazil and the United States for more than $1. No wonder foreign goods flood into Brazil, swamping Brazilian exports. No wonder there is so much demand for foreign loans to finance the resulting trade deficit.
No one is more outspoken on this issue than Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development and a persistent critic of I.M.F. practices. The proposed loan package is fine, he says. So are President Cardoso's austerity measures. But neither will work without a 25 percent devaluation of the real. Many economists agree in principle, but favor a smaller devaluation, say 15 percent.
"The Brazilians are suffering today from slow economic growth," Mr. Sachs said, "in part because they have been trying for months to defend an over-valued currency."
The issue is interest rates. In the midst of a worldwide financial crisis, foreign banks and other foreign lenders have grown increasingly reluctant to put money in a country that might soon have to devalue its currency. Brazil's hard currency reserves have dwindled to $50 billion from $75 billion in recent months as foreign money is withdrawn from the country. And part of the $50 billion could soon depart, as repayments are made for $49 billion in loans from foreign banks that have been coming due this year.
To keep the money in the country -- and also discourage Brazilians from converting their reals to dollars and depositing billions abroad -- President Cardoso has doubled interest rates since mid-summer, to more than 40 percent a year. At so high a level, Mr. Sachs argues, economic activity is discouraged and the already sluggish Brazilian economy will soon find itself in a severe recession. Devalue the currency, he says, and interest rates can be lowered.
The I.M.F. and the Administration are counting on the giant loan package, along with President Cardoso's spending cutbacks and the high Brazilian interest rates, to restore the confidence of foreign lenders before a recession can take hold. They resist devaluation on two other counts. It would end Brazil's fixed exchange rate, and that could frighten Argentina, and even Hong Kong -- two other countries still keeping to fixed rates.
And, they say, while the real may indeed be overvalued, any attempt at a limited devaluation could get out of hand in the current panicky environment. The real would then plunge in value, bringing the Asian crisis full-force to Latin America.

HEADLINE: THE GERMAN ELECTION: THE DEFEATED;
In Defeat, the Unifier of Germany Claims Yet Another Political First

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

 BODY:
It was characteristic that even when Helmut Kohl was finally ousted in Germany's national elections, he scored a first -- this time as the first postwar German Chancellor to be voted out of office.
It was not a first that Mr. Kohl relished, to be sure, nor one he likely worried about. For all his extraordinary records, both political and physical -- the first Chancellor of a reunited Germany, the longest-serving German Chancellor since Otto von Bismarck, and, at 6 foot 4 and somewhere around 300 pounds, indisputably the largest leader in modern Europe -- Mr. Kohl has not spent much of the past 16 years pondering his place in history. 
 "To hell with history," he once snapped at an aide who raised the subject. His medium was politics, and it was a medium in which he was a master, even if in the end he failed to recognize when to step aside.
Throughout his career, Mr. Kohl attracted an unending stream of unflattering jokes, and was often perceived by intellectuals as something of an embarrassing provincial politico. But nobody ever questioned his total control of his own party, the Christian Democratic Union, nor his skill in guiding his nation through the Byzantine politics of post-war and post-Communist Europe.
If he disdained talk of his "place in history," Mr. Kohl bridled when his opponents accused him of lacking vision. His was as concrete as it was consistent: to unify his people in the context of a unified Europe.
"Who has a better vision here in the Federal Republic?" he declared in 1990, on the eve of German unification. "I know no better concept than the one I represent -- European unification -- because in 10 years we will write 2000 and not 1900, and this country and this continent will have a chance in the year 2000, and beyond, only if they are united. O. K., there is the vision."
He spoke of unity as a "compass" in his politics. "My compass also says, to an almost emotional degree, friendship with France, friendship with the United States," he said.
If his formulation lacked the eloquence of a Helmut Schmidt or a Willy Brandt, Mr. Kohl never deviated from his compass, even when his decisions ran against the tide.
In the 1980's, his determination to maintain West Germany in an American-led NATO by allowing the deployment of Pershing II missiles prompted vast and brutal protests, yet he persevered.
And once the disintegration of the Communist world made reunification possible, he managed the Herculean task of gaining the acquiescence of the skeptical leaders of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France, and reuniting Germany within 11 months of the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
The achievement proved considerably more painful than Mr. Kohl had promised, and it was the enormous cost of reunification that eventually led to his political fall. But not many politicians or historians have argued that Mr. Kohl erred in his decision to press ahead with reunification as quickly as possible.
"I've been wrong about some things since 1990, but who hasn't been?" Mr. Kohl mused in the spring of 1994 -- one of the many times when the polls predicted prematurely that his era was coming to an end. Yet more than his vision or even his political skills, Mr. Kohl's longevity was probably due to the degree to which he represented his generation of western Germans.
What his adversaries often perceived as an uncanny political antenna was rooted in the degree to which he represented a generation struggling to reconcile the stigma of Germany's history with its remarkable economic and political revival.
Fifteen when the war ended, Mr. Kohl was old enough to know first-hand the horrors of Nazism and the war, but young enough to claim what he called "the absolution of late birth" -- a notion that irritated some listeners but was shared by many of his and younger generations.
Raised in in the hinterlands of the Roman Catholic Rhineland, he learned like many West Germans to balance a quiet patriotism against a constant awareness of how others perceived his people. Although his insistence on serving as host to President Ronald Reagan at a cemetery where some SS soldiers were buried created a furor in 1985, many of his trips abroad -- most notably to Poland and to Israel -- became milestones of reconciliation.
A man who relished quintessentially German food like stuffed sow's belly and plum pie, who never shed his provincial Rhineland accent and who commuted regularly to his home town of Ludwigshafen to mingle with its respectable, hard-working, heavy-eating, prosperous burghers, Mr. Kohl was the image of what his Christian Democratic Party represented.
Active in the party almost from the time of its founding after the war, Mr. Kohl rose rapidly, scoring "firsts" at every step -- at 30 the youngest member of his state legislature, at 33 the youngest floor leader, at 39 the youngest state premier, at 43 the youngest chairman of the Christian Democratic Union and finally, in 1982, at 52, the youngest Chancellor.
Yet at every step, critics spoke of his "luck," and predicted that he would go no further. His first speech as a legislator was so terrible that his colleagues wrote him off. In 1976, the legendary head of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, Franz Josef Strauss, declared that Mr. Kohl was "totally incapable." And when Mr. Kohl did become Chancellor in 1982, his adversaries noted, it was not through an election, but because the small Free Democratic Party shifted support from the Social Democrats to Mr. Kohl.
In fact, Mr. Kohl personally never did well in polls, usually gaining office by being at the head of his party's list, and not through a direct victory. In today's voting, he was defeated in his home constituency of Ludwigshafen.
Yet so often did he defy challengers that stories of his revivals became cliches. When this election came along, it was a measure of Mr. Kohl's reputation that nobody predicted his loss with certainty, even when all the polls pointed to it.

HEADLINE: Schumer Tours Upstate to Counter Attacks by D'Amato

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: UTICA, N.Y., Sept. 27

 BODY:
After a week of being assailed in television advertising as a "liberal Brooklyn Congressman" hostile to upstate interests, Charles E. Schumer campaigned across western and central New York today, ticking off the names of relatives who had lived there and blaming Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato for the economic decline that has gripped this region.
From an airport terminal in Rochester to a union gathering in Syracuse to the front porch of the house where his father grew up in this central New York city, the Democratic candidate for Senate asserted that, his ZIP code and accent notwithstanding, he was sympathetic to the concerns of voters north of New York City. Mr. Schumer's visit here, which followed a series of television advertisements directed by Mr. Schumer at upstate audiences, signaled the extent to which both Mr. Schumer and Mr. D'Amato are viewing upstate as critical to the outcome of the November election. 
 Again and again, Mr. Schumer spoke about the anemic economy in the region, pledging to push legislation that he said would lower the cost of electricity and air fares, two major constraints on economic growth. But again and again, Mr. Schumer was reminded of the potency of Mr. D'Amato's saturation television campaign as he was repeatedly asked by reporters how a lawmaker who had spent his life representing New York City constituents could understand the concerns of upstate New Yorkers.
"Chuck Schumer is a tough-on-crime, tax-cutting, moderate Democrat, whose dad was raised in Utica, who shares the same values as upstate New Yorkers," Mr. Schumer said into a clutch of television cameras in Syracuse. He accused Mr. D'Amato of dividing the state for political gain, adding, "All his name-calling and negativity does nothing positive for the people of this state -- downstate or upstate."
In Brooklyn, Mr. D'Amato countered Mr. Schumer's move by venturing into the Congressman's district, appealing directly to Jewish voters and predicting that he would beat Mr. Schumer in his own backyard. "I'm going to carry this district," said Mr. D'Amato, who also campaigned today in Suffolk County.
Mr. D'Amato bristled at Mr. Schumer's assertion that the Republican Senator was running a divisive campaign and that he had failed to tend to the needs of New York's troubled upstate economy.
"That's total nonsense," he said after speaking at a Holocaust memorial service at the East Midwood Jewish Center in Brooklyn. "If you look at the record, you will see that repeatedly we have delivered over and over again for New York."
Mr. D'Amato declared that Mr. Schumer had been divisive in Congress by voting, for example, to raise the gasoline tax. "His votes are being divisive," said Mr. D'Amato, who has also supported a gas tax rise. "You've got to represent all the people. I have. I represented the interests of upstate, while at the same token, fighting for, championing and getting the largest increase for mass transportation because the people here in Brooklyn need it. And I've never played one against the other."
The exchanges captured a day in which Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Schumer battled over constituencies -- geographic and ethnic -- that both sides see as critical to victory in what has become one of the closest watched contests in the country.
Mr. D'Amato announced his intention to visit Brooklyn shortly after learning that Mr. Schumer had organized a trip upstate in an apparent attempt to confront him in a part of the state that the Senator has identified as his prime battleground. Mr. Schumer was trailed by a chartered plane filled with reporters.
Mr. Schumer, dodging thunderstorms that chased his single-propeller plane through a bumpy itinerary that included Rochester, Syracuse, Utica and Albany (Ithaca and Binghamton were rained out), signaled how he intended to compete with Mr. D'Amato upstate. He said the Senator had shown no concern about how this part of New York had lagged behind the economic recovery most of the nation had enjoyed.
"He hasn't done anything to create jobs in western New York," Mr. Schumer said. "Al D'Amato hasn't talked about jobs. He hasn't talked about ways to get businesses to come here and stay here. He has no plan. Rochester doesn't need a Senator who once every six years comes up to Rochester, calls somebody some names and then vanishes."
Democrats who accompanied Mr. Schumer accused Mr. D'Amato of running a divisive campaign. "They're going to try to pit one part of the state against the other for political advantage," said State Senator Richard A. Dollinger of Rochester. "I believe it's outrageous."
Mr. Schumer went to considerable lengths to try to dodge Mr. D'Amato's effort to characterize him as alien to upstate. At every opportunity, he took note of some relative who had made a home, no matter how briefly, in this part of the world. "I feel at home here," he said in Rochester. "I love this city. I have relatives here. In fact, my uncle is the head of surgery at Strong Memorial Hospital."
At Mr. Schumer's request, his parents drove up from Brooklyn to join him in Utica, so his father, Abe, who is 75, could pose with him at the home where the elder Mr. Schumer lived for three of the nine years he was here.
Yet even in front of his father's house, there were reminders of the difficulties Mr. Schumer faced here. John Cosgrove, a lawyer from the town of Clinton, who served in the Assembly in the 1960's, stopped by to praise Mr. Schumer's candidacy. When asked his party affiliation, Mr. Cosgrove responded loudly, "I was a Democrat," but then dropped his voice to a whisper. "And a liberal. But don't put that word in."
And one of the people who now lives in Abe Schumer's old home, Lisa Smith, said she had learned of the Democratic Senate candidate through Mr. D'Amato. "I hadn't even heard of Chuck Schumer until the last couple of weeks, until we heard the negative ads," she said. Ms. Smith added that she was offended by Mr. D'Amato's ads and was likely to vote for Mr. Schumer.
Mr. D'Amato's visit at a service in Brooklyn, organized by the Association of Holocaust Survivors From the Former Soviet Union, came as some analysts said his attacks on Mr. Schumer as a Brooklyn liberal could shake his standing among Jewish voters who are inclined to be sympathetic to Mr. Schumer.
At the service, Mr. D'Amato, wearing a yarmulke, discussed his fight against Swiss banks on behalf of Jewish depositors and their heirs who were refused the return of their money after World War II. "Our record is one that I'm proud of," he said. "For 40-plus years, the victims and their families of the Holocaust, no one paid attention to them, and I think when you come back and tell people, here I was and I did it and I was there, they understand that."

HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE FIRST LADY;
Hillary Clinton, Smile in Place, Hits Fund-Raisers

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Is she a national role model as First Lady? The President's top crisis manager determined to rescue his legacy? Or a traumatized victim deserving of America's embrace?
In a three-day, five-state fund-raising tour on behalf of Democratic candidates for Congress, Hillary Rodham Clinton was analyzed and lionized, criticized and beatified on each of these points. 
 Through it all, she stayed the course, smiling opaquely and assuring old friends and political allies that she was "Just fine!" as she thickly larded her speeches with praise of the President and criticism of Congress.
Her steadfast fans could not stop themselves from gushing.
"She's kind of like our American Princess Di," said Lawrence Johnson, 30, a clerk at Seattle's Westin Hotel who saw Mrs. Clinton as she swept in for an evening of fund-raising on Thursday. "They ought to leave her husband alone. And she should be our next President!"
With elections just a few weeks away and concerns that the President's sex scandal may inhibit Democrats from voting, Mrs. Clinton is getting many standing ovations as she asks audiences to empty their pockets and get out the vote.
And if there was any doubt that Mrs. Clinton was withholding support from her husband as she sorted out her own feelings, she dispelled it in her sweep through New York, Colorado, Washington, Oregon and California.
At times she seemed to be campaigning even more for Mr. Clinton than she was for the candidates, tirelessly promoting him as the President who turned around the economy, reduced crime, furthered educational change and balanced the budget for the first time since Neil Armstrong walked on the moon.
"By any objective measure, by any fair assessment, our country is so much better off because of my husband's leadership," she told a crowd of several hundred at a fund-raising dinner for four Congressional candidates in Seattle.
Most of the candidates said little about the President, and in some cases they appeared relieved that she, not he, was around.
Even so, Mrs. Clinton sits at the innermost circle of the President's crisis-management team, drafting hardball responses to the Lewinsky scandal and the Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit -- and to the Republicans who have attacked the President because of them. Mrs. Clinton's loyalists believe that she is a First Lady with a future, no matter how the Clinton Presidency weathers the impeachment debate, no matter whether the White House strategy, to which she has contributed so much, prevails.
"The attraction of Mrs. Clinton is that she focuses on the issues rather than the distractions swirling around Washington, D.C.," said Jay Inslee, who is running for Congress in Washington State. "The President is a distraction."
Despite the best efforts of Democratic candidates to change the subject from Mr. Clinton's woes to issues like child care, education, Social Security and the environment, the President's troubles kept intruding, often in unexpected ways.
At a re-election fund-raiser for Senator Barbara Boxer in the grand ballroom of the San Francisco Hilton Hotel on Friday night, the actress, Frances Fisher, of "Titanic" fame read excerpts from Mrs. Clinton's best seller, "It Takes a Village," telling the $250-a-plate audience of 1,100 supporters how children are "a moral touchstone amidst the complexity and contentiousness of modern life."
But on the sidewalk outside the hotel, 8-year-old Carolyn Ahr carried a poster that she had drawn with a sad face and the words, "The President lies and should be fired."
"Mrs. Clinton is a setback for American women," said Catherine Ahr, 37, a homemaker, and Carolyn's mother. "I've never protested in my life -- and I even went to Berkeley. But this time was different. What kind of moral message does this whole thing send to our children?"
In none of her child-related events did Mrs. Clinton answer that question. None of the candidates did either.
At Portland State University in Oregon, Mrs. Clinton appeared in front of a big poster that read, "Kids First" with David Wu, a Yale-educated lawyer and candidate for Congress whose main pitch is education and who praised his guest as "our nation's foremost children's advocate."
Asked whether there was a conflict between Mrs. Clinton's focus on children's needs and the difficulty parents are having in explaining her husband's behavior to their children, Mr. Wu said, "I will have to think about that."
So much was said in code and fraught with double meaning on Mrs. Clinton's campaign tour that it was often hard to sort out what the real message was supposed to be.
At the fund-raising dinner in Seattle, Mrs. Clinton mocked what she called "the other Washington."
"I think that's the way to look at it," she said. "It's like a parallel universe and sort of exists out there somewhere in outer space."
But she also said that the American people do not get enough political news, and throughout her trip described politics as a noble calling, exhorting her audiences to "persuade people that politics matters."
Unlike the First Lady, Mrs. Boxer, whose daughter is married to Mrs. Clinton's brother, said flat out in her speech at the fund-raiser in San Francisco, "The President has problems."
But she never said what they were. And she blamed the "extraordinary atmosphere we are living in" for making it impossible to get the media to focus on serious issues.
But it was not just the media that were focusing on sex. There was also Art Torres, the chairman of the California Democratic Party, introducing Mrs. Boxer and explaining how her Republican opponent in 1992, Bruce Herschensohn, was "the family values guy on every day except Friday nights."
"And then we found out," Mr. Torres continued, "he did other things in his spare time."
The audience groaned. Some people even cursed their chairman. (In 1992 the Democrats turned up evidence that Mr. Herschensohn had frequented a nude bar in Hollywood called The Seventh Veil and bought girlie magazines.)
"He didn't have to do that!" a woman said, referring to Mr. Torres's remarks. "This is not the time to bring this up."
As in San Francisco, there were competing demonstrators in Denver, where Mrs. Clinton campaigned on Thursday for Dottie Lamm, Colorado's former first lady who is running against Ben Nighthorse Campbell for the Senate, and Gail Schoettler, Lieutenant Governor and a candidate for governor.
As Mrs. Clinton shook hands with children in front of Fort Logan Elementary School outside Denver, Ilona Smith, 41, a mental health worker, shouted, "Hang in there, Hillary," as protesters down the block chanted, "Jail Slick Willy." A handmade sign read, "Lyin' King and the Queen of Denial." Another read, "It Takes a Village to Raise an Idiot."
"It's a really inappropriate forum for what these people are doing," Ms. Smith said. "It's rude, it's ill-mannered, it's embarrassing to Colorado. It's Hillary that's here, not Bill."
Mrs. Clinton spoke to safe, friendly audiences. She has avoided situations in which journalists could question her.
She was tireless in raising money and stingy with the chitchat.
In Seattle, a picture with her cost $2,500. She took a quick hello-and-thank-you approach. "I told her we support her and the Democratic agenda," said Arun Bhagat, a consulting engineer. "She thanked us for coming. Everyone was very tactful."
At a $200-a-head private reception for 200 in Denver, "a lot of people were doing the two-handed shake, saying thank you for what you're doing for Gail and Dottie," said Laurie Zeller, 38. "Nobody made reference to the current crisis."
Support is what Mrs. Clinton needs these days, said Brian Baird, a clinical psychologist who lost a Congressional race in Washington State in 1996 and is running again. "There was something different in the applause tonight," Mr. Baird said of the fund-raiser in Seattle. "There was a sort of effort to send some love Hillary's way. We want to help her during this trying time, in a healing way, to give her a respite from all this stuff."
Mr. Baird, who teaches psychology and treats cancer patients and other patients, said that he thought Mrs. Clinton was "doing well." But then, he added, " 'Well' is a relative word."

HEADLINE: Bronx Offers Stadium Plan for Keeping Team

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Hoping to place the Bronx back at the center of the debate over a home for the Yankees, the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, plans to offer a proposal today to renovate Yankee Stadium, install 120 luxury boxes, ease traffic congestion and redevelop the neighborhood with a waterfront park, a Yankee Hall of Fame and sports-related stores.
Mr. Ferrer's proposal, called Yankee Village, comes a month before George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the Yankees' principal owner, is expected to announce his decision on where the team will play after its lease with the city expires in 2002. Mr. Steinbrenner has long threatened to move his team to New Jersey or Manhattan, complaining that the Bronx stadium has too few luxury boxes and parking spaces, and that the neighborhood is unpleasant, unsafe and a traffic nightmare. 
 Mr. Ferrer's plan, which he commissioned himself and which combines elements of several previous stadium proposals, would cost an estimated $535 million, far less than any new stadium. But the chances of Mr. Ferrer's single-handedly settling the issue seem far-fetched, given his fierce and frequent criticism of the two people whose support for any stadium plan is essential: Mr. Steinbrenner and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Whatever its fate, the Ferrer plan is likely to add another layer of complexity to the speculation and debate caused by Mr. Steinbrenner's shaky commitment to the Bronx. Mayor Giuliani has praised the economic benefits of a billion-dollar stadium on the West Side of Manhattan. New Jersey beckons with its own plans. Even The Star-Ledger of Newark has weighed in, publishing its own plan yesterday for a stadium in northern New Jersey.
But even though a Yankee move has at times seemed a foregone conclusion, the focus of the debate has shifted in recent weeks back to the Bronx.
Just last week, Gov. George E. Pataki declared that the Yankees "belong in the Bronx, period." Mr. Pataki -- perhaps feeling pressure from the Democratic candidate for Governor, Peter F. Vallone, who strongly favors keeping the team in the Bronx -- now contends that traffic jams, widespread opposition and the high cost of construction in Manhattan "argue strongly against that site."
Mr. Steinbrenner himself suggested in July that the Yankees might stay in the Bronx if they drew three million fans this season. A spokesman later backed away from that statement, but the team set an attendance record anyway -- 2,949,734 by yesterday, the end of the regular season.
And now Mr. Ferrer has a plan that seems intended to blunt each of Mr. Steinbrenner's familiar arguments for moving away.
"Our proposal," Mr. Ferrer said, "will present to fans and visitors a year-round entertainment venue that will begin to return to the city the enormous investment the city will, and has already made, in the New York Yankees. It's fan-friendly, fiscally prudent and answers the legitimate concerns raised by the Yankees and by fans."
Under Mr. Ferrer's proposal, the 75-year-old stadium would regain its historic entrance porticos, perimeter wall at the upper deck and distinctive copper friezes, while a new, glass-enclosed concourse would be built on the outside wall. Babe Ruth Plaza would be moved to the west side of the 50,000-seat stadium, where restaurants, sports shops, batting cages and a museum would provide year-round attractions. Fans would arrive and depart from an expanded ferry terminal, a renovated subway station, a new Metro-North station and newly configured highway ramps.
Mr. Ferrer said that Yankee Village would cost less than half the price of a proposed stadium in Manhattan, with an estimated $360 million coming from state, Federal and private sources and only $175 million from the city.
The Ferrer proposal was prepared by the Manhattan architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle, which designed the Ford Center for the Performing Arts on 42d Street and the renovation of Grand Central Terminal. Richard Blinder, a partner at the firm, said he wove together his own ideas, features of the National Tennis Center in Flushing, Queens; Chelsea Piers in Manhattan, and previous design efforts to address complaints by the Yankees.
Mr. Blinder said he did the study for only $25,000 because he believed in the project and because an alternative -- the Yankees' relocating to Manhattan -- "is horrible."
Mr. Steinbrenner may gain some momentum for a move as his team heads toward the World Series. He has been discussing a possible sale of the Yankees to Cablevision, the Long Island company that owns Madison Square Garden. But some sports analysts and even Mr. Steinbrenner's associates say it now appears unlikely that the Yankees will leave the Bronx. As long as the possibility exists, however, Mr. Steinbrenner retains a strong bargaining position.
"The way the Yankees are playing, it makes it more than likely something good will happen for them on the stadium front," said Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp Ltd., a sports business consulting firm based in Chicago. "The West Side has so much structural opposition that it is not likely to happen. But as long as that possibility is out there, it can be used as leverage to get a better deal in the Bronx."
Built in 1923, Yankee Stadium was the first three-tiered ball park and the first to be called a stadium. In the mid-1970's, Mayor John V. Lindsay renovated the stadium, but failed to make good on promises to rehabilitate the neighborhood as the cost ballooned to $120 million.
Mr. Ferrer's proposal seeks to restore many of the original elements obliterated by the earlier renovation, although some things may be gone forever. The original Yankee bat rack and bullpen steps are at the Smithsonian Institution, while the foul poles and some of the lights are in Osaka, Japan.
Under Mr. Ferrer's plan, luxury boxes would be built along the entire mezzanine level, while the stadium club, with a new dining terrace, would be moved to left field.
To answer the most persistent complaints from Mr. Steinbrenner and fans about traffic congestion and parking, Yankee Village calls for the creation of a total of 10,340 parking spaces (up from about 7,000) at six garages that are designed to feed traffic across either the Macombs Dam Bridge or the 145th Street Bridge, or onto local streets. The proposal also calls for building exits from Harlem River Drive, widening the exits from the Major Deegan Expressway and expanding the use of reversible lanes during games.
"The traffic problems at Yankee Stadium are solvable," said Samuel I. Schwartz, a transportation consultant and the former Deputy Commissioner and chief engineer of the city's Department of Transportation, who has seen parts of Mr. Ferrer's plan.
The plan tries to go beyond simply solving the team's problems by integrating the stadium into the economic life of the surrounding neighborhood. Restaurants and retail stores would be built alongside the Yankee Hall of Fame. Storefronts and street lighting would be improved along River Avenue and 161st Street.
The new garages would be limited to three stories to reduce the impact on the community and the exit time for automobiles. At the same time, sports centers with ball fields for local teams would be atop garages on the northeast and south sides of the stadium.
Most important, Mr. Ferrer said, he would have the city condemn the dilapidated Bronx Terminal Market, a 32-acre site on the south side of the stadium, to build a waterfront park along the Harlem River and 450,000 square feet of commercial space.
"We think this will revive the existing commercial areas and restore the neighborhood parks for Little League teams that play in the shadow of Yankee Stadium," Mr. Ferrer said. "It will ignite a whole system of active and passive parks with vibrant new commercial areas and make this as exciting as Camden Yards or the National Tennis Center."

Loan Package for Brazil
The Clinton Administration and the International Monetary Fund are taking the lead in putting together a package of loans for Brazil, likely to total more than $30 billion, to limit the damage from the Asian crisis to Latin America's biggest economy. A bailout plan is risky, but one that American leaders seem inclined to take for Brazil, which buys nearly 20 percent of America's exports and is home to thousands of American-owned factories. A1

HEADLINE: Tokyo Politician Raises Hope for Real Opposition

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Obscured by the mountains of bad debts, by the battles in Parliament, by the growing international frustration at Japan's tardiness in confronting its economic problems, something remarkable is bubbling up in Japan.
It is a genuine, credible political opposition. In a country that for half a century has been largely a one-party state, it is striking to see a vigorous opposition leader -- Naoto Kan, a tempestuous baby-boomer nicknamed Kan the Irritable -- assailing the Government's policies and forcing it to accept his own instead. 
 It is unclear whether this is a step toward a two-party system in Japan or simply another political dead end. Japan has tried for years to nurture a genuine two-party system, in hopes of making government more honest and effective, but this has never happened except for brief periods.
Mr. Kan still faces enormous challenges in holding his fractious Democratic Party together, but so far he has managed better than most people expected in forging a broad anti-Government alliance. He has seized on the economic crisis to embarrass the Government, and he clearly hopes to replace Keizo Obuchi in the Prime Minister's residence.
"Of course we aim for the earliest possible dissolution of Parliament, because the Obuchi Government is not the choice of the people," said Mr. Kan, noting that Mr. Obuchi was not elected but was installed by the governing Liberal Democratic Party between elections. "Soon, the time will come when it will be apparent to people that the Obuchi administration is deadlocked and cannot achieve anything."
How soon will that be?
"In a few months," Mr. Kan said confidently.
Most experts do not see matters so clearly. For starters, general elections need not be held for two more years, and the Liberal Democrats are so unpopular right now that it is in their interest to try to delay elections as long as possible.
Moreover, while Mr. Kan has shaken up Japanese politics and is greatly admired as an individual, he is also untested as a national leader. His Democratic Party has a poor grass-roots organization and no clear identity, and while voters are fed up with the Liberal Democrats, it is not clear that they would prefer the Democrats.
While the United States and other countries have long hoped for the emergence of an effective multi-party structure in Japan, for now the spectacle in Tokyo has not so much inspired Washington as alarmed it. The wrangling in Parliament delayed any action on bailing out Japan's crippled banking system, although on Saturday the governing and opposition parties agreed -- for a second time -- on a joint plan for legislation to stabilize the country's financial system.
This joint plan is based largely on Mr. Kan's proposals, a rare case in which the political opposition in Japan actually contributed anything to the decision-making process. And so while the clash of political parties may slow the economic recovery, some see it as a milestone in Japan's political development.
"The whole process may be chaotic and a bit scary, but it's been very helpful for Japanese democracy," said John F. Neuffer, who writes a newsletter on Japanese politics. "This is the first time in memory that the opposition is looking like a credible opposition."
For most of the postwar period, the Liberal Democrats presided grandly over the political scene in Japan, with a token opposition provided by the Socialists. In 1993, a schism in the Liberal Democratic Party allowed the opposition to take power briefly, but opposing politicians never formed an effective party.
Then Mr. Kan suddenly appeared on the scene two years ago as a gust of fresh air, serving as Health Minister and uncovering a scandal in his own ministry. He won raves for seeming to be a take-charge politician who would lead the bureaucrats instead of the other way around.
Mr. Kan also has a sense, rare in Japan, of how to use television and public relations, while Mr. Obuchi rarely gives interviews and is ineffective when he does. Mr. Obuchi comes across a bit like the Russian Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, for both rose in one-party systems in which the key to success was impressing superiors rather than charming television audiences.
Mr. Kan has been particularly adept at appealing to the resentments of urban voters ("tax-payers," he calls them) whom the Government has traditionally treated as a cash cow to subsidize rural citizens ("tax-eaters," in Mr. Kan's terminology).
Still, one of Mr. Kan's key tests will be whether he can maintain the opposition's unity when the subject is no longer the economic crisis. The opposition is a mosaic of different political hues, and it will be difficult to forge a common front on issues down the road like legislation defining the degree of military cooperation with the United States.
"We really need a balanced two-party system, but unfortunately, the opposition parties have lots of divisions and fights and personality differences," said Kazuyuki Hamada, a political expert and writer in Tokyo. "This opposition coalition is very fragile, with so many competing interests."

HEADLINE: THE GERMAN ELECTION: THE REACTION;
Europeans Congratulate Both Winner And Loser

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 27

 BODY:
European leaders congratulated both Gerhard Schroder and the man he defeated today in Germany's elections, Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
President Jacques Chirac of France, a conservative like Mr. Kohl, and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, whose fellow Socialists saw in the victory of Mr. Schroder's Social Democrats a continuation of a European trend that brought them and the Labor Party of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain to power last year, paid tribute to both German leaders in almost equal measure. 
 Mr. Chirac and Mr. Jospin hailed Mr. Kohl's role in consolidating European unity after German reunification in 1990, and expressed confidence that Mr. Schroder would carry on in the same tradition.
Mr. Blair, in Blackpool, England, for a Labor Party convention, telephoned Mr. Schroder to congratulate him and told reporters later, "It's a tremendous thing that we will now see center-left government in Britain, France and Germany. I pay tribute to Helmut Kohl for all of the things he has done for Europe."
There was a widespread sense that a turn by German voters to the left after a generation was a historic turning point that was not so much about ideology as about German self-confidence and assertiveness.
"The change has already taken place," Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France said recently. "It's a different Germany from the one we knew from 1949 to 1989."
What he meant was that more than half a century after the end of World War II, Germans no longer felt a need to buy respectability as partners in the building of Europe. They feel they have earned it, by their performance as the economic powerhouse of the continent, as good neighbors to all nine countries on their borders, as allies with the United States and Britain in NATO and as supportive partners of Russia.
Never before had Germany enjoyed good relations with all those countries at once, Mr. Kohl kept telling voters in his campaign, and Mr. Schroder did not contest the achievement. Germany, both clearly agreed, could now pursue its legitimate national interest in Europe freed of the complexes that had inhibited it.
Indeed, Mr. Kohl's Government surprised its European partners at a summit meeting in Amsterdam last year by announcing that Germany was no longer willing to be taken for granted as the rich uncle of the European Union.
Even with only 15 members, the European Union is strained to its financial limits. But if Poland and Hungary were admitted now, the common agricultural policy by which industrial Germany agreed to support French farmers in exchange for access to the Common Market in 1957 would bankrupt Europe as it currently operates.
And Germany has made clear it will not go on paying unless the rules are rewritten more equitably. "The Germans are still good Europeans, but they don't give anything away any more," Mr. Vedrine said. "We defend French interests with great energy, as the British defend theirs, and the Germans are becoming more like us."
A spokesman for the conservative Government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said the country was confident of continued close relations with Mr. Schroder as Chancellor.
With only Italy among major European states now governed by conservative parties, there are also those who see the chance for a new coordinated European approach to the problems of unemployment and instability in global financial markets.
Asked if Mr. Schroder's victory could be seen as a victory for European social democracy, Jack Lang, a French Socialist who campaigned for him in Germany, agreed, adding, "There's a great chance to give new dynamism to a Europe that has been a bit in the doldrums recently."
The Social Democratic Chancellor of Austria, Victor Klima, described the German election results as a "historic success" for Social Democrats but also "a success for a Europe of employment, a success for a Europe with more social justice and a success for a Europe of social democracy." He, too, expressed "respect and thanks to a truly great European, Helmut Kohl."

HEADLINE: Satellites Guiding Industries on the Move

BYLINE: By JIM CARRIER 

 BODY:
Moving millions of tons of earth around the Black Thunder coal mine in Wright, Wyo., has come to resemble playing a video game, except that the score is kept by military satellites high overhead.
Inside the cab of each behemoth D11 Caterpillar, a computer screen displays a little bulldozer plowing through virtual dirt -- red for what needs moving and blue for what needs covering. As a global positioning system, or G.P.S., receiver on the roof tracks the dozer's movement across the screen, the operator's job, explains Jim Long, the mine's chief surveyor, is to "push the red to the blue," creating the color green for the desired grade. 
 "It is really slick," Mr. Long said. "They don't even have to look out the window -- except to keep from running over somebody."
Black Thunder, a division of Arch Coal Inc. of St. Louis, will produce 47 millions tons of coal this year from this one mine, about 5 percent of United States production. And at a time when coal prices are at an historic low of less than $5 a ton, the G.P.S. gear, linked to a computer-designed mine plan, helps the company achieve crucial new levels of efficiency -- whether building roads across the nine-square-mile site, uncovering coal seams or reconstructing the original prairie contour once the coal is extracted.
"When the company first put G.P.S. units on its bulldozers in July 1997, we had some increases of 30 percent in productivity," Mr. Long said. "That's a pretty amazing number. It's not that the guy is moving any more dirt. He's getting it to the right place the first time."
Arch Coal is just one of thousands of American companies putting G.P.S. to work, appropriating a system originally intended for military navigation and using it for such commercial purposes as mapping delivery routes, tracking products all the way from factory floor to retail shelf, and monitoring the whereabouts of mobile workers.
Available for limited civilian use since 1984 but fully operational only since 1995, G.P.S. technology has become so important to industry that many businesses now consider it a utility like the Internet -- an element of information technology helping fuel America's economic engine.
A Commerce Department study (infoserv2.ita.doc.gov/ot) released this month estimates that worldwide G.P.S. equipment sales will reach $4 billion this year, and will double by 2000 and double again, to $16 billion, by 2003.
In contrast to Japan and Europe, where car-navigation systems are the main use of G.P.S. technology, the commercial market in the United States is dominated by mapping and geographic information systems like that employed by the Black Thunder mine. Even though G.P.S. gear is installed in virtually all United States military vehicles, and the satellite system is run by the Air Force Space Command in Colorado Springs, military purchases for G.P.S. now represent just a fraction of industry sales.
"Military uses are swamped by civilian use," said Joe Canny, deputy assistant Secretary of Transportation and the principal staff person on the Government's Interagency G.P.S. Executive Board, which sets the nation's G.P.S. policy.
No one has estimated the impact of G.P.S. on the nation's gross domestic product, but the figure is presumably "enormous," said Scott Pace, an analyst at the Rand Science and Technology Policy Institute and a co-author of the Commerce Department study.
"If you add up the critical industries -- oil and gas, financial networks, transportation -- you find that G.P.S. is an embedded assumption in the functioning in every one of those things," Mr. Pace said.
Take, for example, time.
Carrying atomic clocks that are corrected daily to Naval Observatory standards, the 24 G.P.S. satellites that orbit the Earth some 11,000 nautical miles above the Equator are the largest source of accurate time in the world. Much of the nation's power grid, and all of its long-distance telephone networks, as well as paging and mobile phone systems, are kept synchronized via software that periodically downloads G.P.S. time, said Dennis McCarthy, director of the Directorate of Time at the Naval Observatory in Washington.
The Naval Observatory's time data is available over the Internet (www.usno.navy.mil) and from computers around the country that periodically correct their clocks when an orbiting satellite passes overhead.
And G.P.S. time has become a crucial component of securities trading and many other forms of financial transactions. The Nasdaq trading system, for example, relies on a master clock kept in synch by a satellite dish in Trumball, Conn., which allows every Nasdaq trade to receive an official time stamp.
The first commercial receiver in 1984 cost $150,000, weighed 100 pounds and was accurate to within 100 meters.
Today a hand-held G.P.S. receiver costs as little as $100, and the semiconductor chip sets are small enough that the technology is finding its way into cell phones. And error-correction techniques have advanced so that specialized G.P.S. devices can be accurate to the width of a golf ball.
Such advances have brought all sorts of new G.P.S. commercial and industrial uses. Backpack G.P.S. units have revolutionized surveying of construction sites, power lines and boundaries. Creating accurate control points for such jobs in 1986, for example, required two workers, one to hold a marked rod and the other to site direction and elevation through a transit, at a cost of $10,000 a point. Backpack units worn by a single worker have reduced the cost to $250 a point, according to the Commerce Department study.
But in many cases, the business trend in G.P.S. has been away from the navigational question "Where am I on earth?" and toward the more managerial interrogation "Where on earth are you?"
Federal Express, for instance, has installed G.P.S. units on its 1,600 long-haul trucks, to track their movements and arrival times. The trucks' locations are beamed to satellites every 10 minutes, and computers route that data to destinations so that workers there can be ready.
Before the G.P.S. units were installed two years ago, Federal Express made "educated guesswork," according to Charlie Hicks, who is in charge of ground freight. "Because of our service commitment," he said, "it is very important to know when things are going to get in."
A similar system, sold by the Highway Master Corporation of Dallas for $2,000 a truck, has been installed on 100,000 trucks around the nation, including the fleet of Wal-Mart Stores; it can keep track of average speeds and miles per gallon. The Highway Master system also incorporates cellular telephones to let fleet operators stay in even closer touch with their drivers.
G.P.S. is by no means a commercial cure-all. In Denver, where Yellow Cab, a subsidiary of Stamford Capital, installed a $100,000 G.P.S.-based dispatching system in 1996, at an average cost of $350 a cab, the company has not yet seen any improvement in dispatching efficiency, said Michael Brown, the company's director of information systems. So far, the system mainly just lets dispatchers know how many cabs are stacked up at Denver International Airport, Mr. Brown said. He added that it probably would not have much impact on costs and revenues until a related "closest cab" dispatcher- software program is installed a few months from now.
The Denver system has had at least one tangible benefit, however. When a customer tried to steal a cab while the driver was in a store, the dispatcher radioed the police with the cab's location and the cab was stopped within two blocks.
In the Gulf of Mexico, many of the petroleum industry's floating oil rigs are kept in place over their wells with the aid of G.P.S. signals. John E. Chance & Associates Inc., a division of Fegro of the Netherlands, moves rigs into place using G.P.S. signals, and sets up on-board computers that keep watch over a rig's precise position and automatically fire underwater thrusters to move it back into position if it drifts away.
The labor required to position a rig has been cut in half, said Jim O'Neal, general manager of Chance's marine group.
Rising civilian and commercial demand for G.P.S. has prompted the Government's interagency board to approve tripling the number of civilian radio signals coming from the military satellites. The decision was announced earlier this year, but carrying it out has been at least temporarily delayed by technical questions, costs and competition for space on the radio-frequency spectrum. Mr. Canny said the additional signals were expected to be available on new satellites by 2004.
One of the largest users of the new signals will be airlines, employing the Federal Aviation Administration's new Wide Area Augmentation System. The system is supposed to allow pilots and air traffic controllers to determine an aircraft's location to an accuracy of within 25 feet -- enabling planes to save fuel and time by flying directly between airports rather than along strictly controlled corridors as they must do now to avoid risk of collisions. Using existing G.P.S. signals and ground-reference points, the first phase will be introduced next year.
Even Hollywood has embraced G.P.S.
In Sylvester Stallone's movie "Daylight," with its climatic escape from a flooded Holland Tunnel into the Hudson River, the main characters were shown bursting through the river's surface from the dark depths below.
But according to Ron Goodman, president of Spacecam, a special-effects film company in Los Angeles, the river was shot during the winter without the actors present. A helicopter camera panned down from the New York skyline as two G.P.S. units, one near the camera and one on the helicopter's tail, recorded the exact spatial orientation.
The camera angle and orientation were later duplicated over Lake Casitas near Los Angeles to film two stunt doubles emerging from the water. Only later did the actors bubble up in a nice warm studio tank -- leaving the rest to the special-effects magicians.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Hellzapoppin' With Dante And Friends

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
The burly performer, isolated by a hot spotlight, sits hunched over a watermelon. He lodges it between his legs and devours it ravenously. "I was Count Ugolino," he says, casting his eyes over his meal. "This was Archbishop Ruggieri."
The revelation is as funny as it is macabre, and is all the artifice the actor Jack Willis requires to conjure one particularly vivid precinct of hell. The Count is a cannibal, and as he relates his terrible autobiography between noisy helpings, one perceives both an act of abundant depravity and of imagination. He makes mouthwatering innards of the flesh of the melon, a skull of the outer shell. Alas, poor, tasty Ruggieri! 
 Mr. Willis, last seen in New York as the empathetic husband in David Mamet's "Old Neighborhood," does wonders with his share of the agonized vignettes of "Dante's Inferno," a highly condensed and remarkably theatrical staged version of the 14th-century epic that takes Dante, played here by Bill Camp and guided by the poet Virgil (Reg E. Cathey), on a fantastic voyage into Hades. Mr. Willis and Leslie Beatty complete the cast, portraying an assortment of damned souls in this economical, two-hour production. And these two -- how shall we put it? -- have all the fun.
Like more tormented versions of the sad sacks Dorothy collects on the yellow brick road, they confide their tales of woe to the visitor from another world. Mr. Willis and Ms. Beatty cringe and shudder, shrink and quake, affixing faces worthy of compassion to the teeming multitudes of the Underworld. As the acting opportunities pile up, the surprise of this "Inferno" becomes clear: even if it is not quite a fully realized verse play, it is much more than a staged reading.
There are certainly structural problems created in the compressing of the work, presented at Playhouse 91 by the 92d Street Y's Unterberg Poetry Center. And some of the more fanciful ideas need further refinement: a vaudeville sketch about lawyers in hell, for instance, would be a crowd-pleasing innovation if it were less clumsily executed.
But what makes this absorbing theater is the handiwork of a director, Robert Scanlan, who knows he must strike more than a few dark chords, and the poet Robert Pinsky, who steeps his translation in sensation and language that is both incisive and stageworthy.
Add to these elements a composer, Bruce Saylor, whose score, written for the violinist Gil Morgenstern, is an aural catalogue of dolors from the depths, and the ingredients are complete for an engrossing adaptation of a poem few would have imagined could work quite so well on a stage.
Mr. Scanlan and his designers, John Michael Deegan and Sarah G. Conly, transfer Dante's hell to the late 20th century. Dressed in business clothes, the actors traverse a mirrored multilevel set that vaguely resembles one of those nondescript office buildings along the interstate (which are some esthetes' idea of hell, anyway). As the story unfolds, so does the scenery, which is divided into compartments reached by ladders and stairs that denote the descending circles of hell.
To make a piece of theater, the work's creators knew they had to provide a sense that the characters were talking to one another, and not simply delivering beautiful oratory. The director shows the audience the differing effects of recital and performance by beginning the second act with Mr. Camp and Mr. Cathey taking turns at a microphone and reading from one of the poem's cantos. The scene is nicely instructive: there's a lot more music in the recitation -- both actors have resonant voices, full of color -- but less emotion. The minute Mr. Camp and Mr. Cathey stop talking in character, the very idea of a story in which they are participants seems to drop out of their voices.
This attenuated "Inferno" is constructed as a brief travelogue, a journey to selected points of interest in hell. Mr. Camp's Dante, hair askew, shirt collar open, begins the play in despair. In the words of the translation by Mr. Pinsky, the nation's poet laureate, Dante is "in dark woods, the right road lost." He embarks on a guided tour of Beelzebub's kingdom in the company of Virgil, played by Mr. Cathey as something of a Netherworld smoothie, a sophisticate showing a neophyte the existential lay of the land.
On the path to enlightenment, to a deeper understanding of mercy and justice, Dante is escorted by Virgil into lots of dark corners, for encounters with tortured beings whose plights could have been rendered by other artists and writers. Mr. Camp comes across a twisted Ms. Beatty, eternally encased in a thorn bush and wearing a countenance out of a painting by Munch. He later listens to the story of the lovers Francesca and Paolo, who wander as vaguely and dolefully as characters imagined by Pirandello. Christopher Walker contributes a sound score full of foreboding, suggested by the textual imagery: the lovers, for example, who enter "as doves whom desire has summoned," are preceded by the sound of birds in flight.
The scenes of Dante and the amazing variety of denizens of hell are some of the most evocative moments, and the production by no means exhausts one's curiosity about them. Dante's father, played by Mr. Willis, is drawn as an old man wrapped in towels at the Luciferian equivalent of a Turkish bath; a torsoless inhabitant is represented by a honeydew that meets an unfortunate end in Dante's arms. (Attention shoppers: Hell has a well-stocked produce department.)
"Dante's Inferno" reflects the poem's episodic nature. It's how skillfully Mr. Scanlan and his collaborators operate within the episodes that makes this an intriguing evening. Mr. Willis is especially rewarding in his myriad character roles, and on both the technical and interpretive level, all four actors speak with a grasp of the work's power and lyricism. This is a piece that gets better the lower it goes.

HEADLINE: Older People Enjoy Sex, Survey Says

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Many older Americans maintain an interest in sex, with nearly half of those over age 60 engaging in sexual activity at least once a month, according to a survey released today.
The survey, commissioned and released by the National Council on the Aging, found that 39 percent of respondents said they were satisfied with the amount of sex they were having, while another 39 percent said they wished they had sex more frequently. 
 "Our study debunks the prevailing myths about sexuality in older years," Dr. James Firman, president of the aging advocacy organization, said at a news conference. "We hope that it leads seniors to more open discussion of their sexuality and to more rewarding lives."
Dr. Neal E. Cutler, director of survey results for the council, said there have been few similar, broad-based surveys of elder sexuality and that the results should serve as a baseline from which to measure future changes in attitude and behavior related to sex among older Americans.
"Older people are sexually active," Dr. Cutler said, "Most older people are interested in sex, they find sex satisfying and they consider sex to be an important part of their lives."
Dr. Cutler said one of the biggest surprises of the survey was the emotional satisfaction from sex reported by active seniors. About 74 percent of sexually active men and 70 percent of active women said they were as satisfied, or even more satisfied, with their sex lives as they were in their 40's.
"This satisfaction could reflect a feeling of freedom about sex that comes with no more fear of pregnancy, having no pressures of children at home or just having more time to be alone with a partner and enjoying one another," Dr. Cutler said.
Active seniors were evenly divided on whether their sex was physically better now, with 43 percent saying it is just as good as or better than in their youth and 43 percent saying sex is less satisfying.
 The survey of 1,292 Americans age 60 or older was conducted this summer by Roper Starch Worldwide Inc. The mail survey of 534 men and 758 women was weighted to match the sex, age, race, income and marital status of the American population over age 60. The survey organization put the margin of error at plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
The study was financed in part by an unrestricted grant from Pfizer Inc., which makes the popular anti-impotence drug Viagra. However, council officials said Pfizer had no role in the design, conduct or interpretation of the survey and was not informed of the results before the report was released today.
Dr. Firman said the survey did not delve into sex-enhancement drugs and treatments that are available now, or expected soon. But he said these treatments and increased discussion of sexuality among the elderly may result in even more sexual activity and reported satisfaction in the future.
Dr. Marian E. Dunn, director of the Center for Human Sexuality at the State University of New York at Brooklyn, said many older people are misinformed about sex and what to expect as they age. She noted that one-third of those surveyed felt it was natural to lose interest in sex as people got older, and that some felt it became physically impossible.
"This just isn't true for most people," she said, "While our bodies change and we respond more slowly or differently, sex is still possible and enjoyable as we get older."

HEADLINE: Struggling to Bolster Minorities in Medicine

BYLINE: By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE 

 BODY:
MEDICAL authorities, educators and civil-rights lawyers, concerned about a sudden drop in minority enrollment in the nation's medical schools, are striking back at moves to fight affirmative action that they believe threaten the future health of minority communities.
A coalition of 51 medical associations is mobilizing forces and raising money to help defeat a Nov. 3 voter initiative in the state of Washington that would ban any form of affirmative action. And minority groups as well as higher education leaders are conducting research and planning court strategies to challenge the movement against affirmative action. The coalition opposing the ballot measure, representing some two million medical professionals, includes the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association. 
 The Washington vote, called Initiative 200, is one of several drives that have been undertaken against affirmative action in recent years. Since 1996, a Federal appeals court has ordered a rollback in affirmative-action programs in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Lawsuits are also in progress to ban affirmative action in Michigan and Maryland. And California's Board of Regents has effectively banned affirmative action at state universities.
First-year minority entrants at medical schools declined by a total of 12 percent from 1994 to 1997. Applications continued to rise in 1994, 1995 and 1996, but then dropped in 1997 by 11 percent, studies by the American Association of Medical Colleges show. By the end of 1997, there were 1,770 new entrants from minorities representing African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, mainland Puerto Ricans, American Indians and Native Alaskans. These minorities accounted for 11 percent of the 16,165 matriculating medical students. In both 1996 and 1997, black medical schools had slight increases in enrollment.
Those minority groups represent about 21 percent of the nation's total population. Asian-Americans and some Hispanic-Americans were not underrepresented in medical schools and were not included in the study. The association had originally hoped to have 3,000 entering students by the year 2000.
Dr. Herbert N. Nickens, the association's vice president for community and minority affairs, said that in the past two years "the anti-affirmative-action drive has really started hitting us, and our progress is slipping."
Dr. David N. Sundwall, chairman of the Council on Graduate Medical Education, an advisory group for Congress and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said in an interview: "The nation's health depends on access to doctors who reflect the nation's increasingly diverse population. Minority doctors are much more likely to set up practices in minority neighborhoods, and they are needed badly there."
For a variety of economic and societal reasons, many illnesses are more common and more deadly among minorities than in the general population. For example, black children have hospitalization rates for asthma about three times those of whites. A significant reason is that there are fewer doctors and health-care centers in inner-cities, where most of the sufferers live.
Moreover, annual death rates for blacks in general are about 50 percent higher than for whites, lowering life expectancy by about five years for women and eight years for men.
Dr. Sundwall said that despite gains in the 1970's and 1980's, minority representation appeared to be decreasing at all levels -- from medical school faculty members, to faculty members in key positions, to initial student applications to acceptances. Accordingly, in testifying in Washington last week before the Joint Commission on the Future of Medicare, which provides $7 billion to programs for teaching hospitals and graduate medical education, Dr. Sundwall urged the commissioners not to cut back on funds used to encourage minority medical school representation.
Jordan J. Cohen, president of the Association of American Medical Colleges, said: "Until we get to the point where we have an applicant pool that contains all sectors of our society with equivalent academic credentials, we will not get out from under the need to make special efforts to identify quality applicants across all those sectors." He added that the ultimate challenge is to repair educational disadvantages that exist so that the broad, diverse applicant pools will form.
The conflict over medical-school admissions policies and minority representation stems from a 1978 case involving Alan Bakke, a white premed student who applied to the medical school at the University of California at Davis. Though he had a slightly higher grade-point average and better scores on the Medical-College Admission Test (MCAT) than several black applicants, he was turned down on the basis of his race to enable the school to achieve a minimum racial quota of minority students.
The United States Supreme Court ruled for Mr. Bakke, saying a decision made solely on the basis of his race amounted to reverse discrimination. But in the second part of that ruling, the Court allowed race to be considered as one of many factors in admissions decisions.
But the 1996 and subsequent rulings by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, for Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, effectively reversed the second part of the Bakke decision. Civil rights groups, including the Legal Defense Fund, challenged the appeals court's right to do so.
Wading into the fray, Derek Bok, former president of Harvard University, and William G. Bowen, former president of Princeton University, have completed a study of the grades, test scores, choice of major, graduation rates, careers and attitudes of 45,000 students at 28 selective universities over 20 years. They concluded that affirmative-action policies in general at the nation's elite colleges have created the backbone of the American black middle class and have taught white classmates the value of integration.
"The most drastic effects in eliminating affirmative action would be on medical and law schools," Dr. Bok said, "because the more selective the institution, the greater the impact, and nothing is more selective that medical schools and law schools."
The dean at the Harvard Medical School, Dr. Joseph B. Martin, who was chancellor at the University of California at San Francisco during the bitter controversy over the Board of Regents action two years ago, said: "I feel extremely strongly about the importance of diversity among medical school graduates. I am very troubled about the decline in applications and matriculations."
The Harvard Medical School has had an average 20 percent minority enrollment in the last five years and is now in its 30th year of pursuing affirmative-action policies. Dean Martin said it receives some 4,000 applications a year and makes a first cut to 800 applicants based on college grade-point averages and MCAT scores. The admissions officers then make decisions relying on a variety of considerations, including academic performance judged in ways other than from test scores, nonacademic accomplishments, backgrounds and leadership ability. "We have no intention of abandoning affirmative action," he said.
Theodore M. Shaw, a counsel for the Legal Defense Fund, called the attack on all forms of affirmative action "an attack by wolves in wolves' clothing."
Ryan N. Dockery, a premed student at Xavier University of Louisiana, a historically black college, said he personally was not being discouraged in his goal of becoming a doctor because of the anti-affirmative action efforts. "I know it's just one more hurdle," he said. "And you do have to look at the problem from all perspectives. It may seem unfair to white students if they have good grades but they are kept out because minority representation is considered. On the other hand, a whole range of disadvantages have worked against minorities and something has to be done for them to level the playing field."

HEADLINE: The Real Policy Makers

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich, a professor of economic and social policy at Brandeis University, was Secretary of Labor in the first Clinton Administration.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
American democracy is upside down. While Congress, the President, talk radio and yell television are obsessed with sex and scandal, the big decisions affecting our lives are hidden from view and made by people largely unaccountable to democratic processes.
Today the Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee will decide what to do next about short-term interest rates. If the Fed decides to reduce interest rates today, jobs will stay plentiful for a while longer, wages will continue to inch upward and homes and cars will become somewhat more affordable. 
 Some economists -- citing the current 4 percent annual growth in wages -- worry that lower interest rates would cause the economy to overheat and inflation to accelerate. That seems unlikely at a time when one-half the world's economies are stagnant or shrinking. And even if it proved true, a little inflation may be worth the extra jobs and higher wages that would come with it.
How do we decide whether the risk is worth it? We don't. It's all up to Alan Greenspan and his colleagues, and they will decide today in secret. (Summaries of their proceedings are eventually made public.)
In the old days, when America had a fiscal policy to speak of (that is, when Presidents and Congress were willing to spur the economy through public spending and tax cuts) and money didn't rush nearly as fast or as easily across national borders, decisions like this were important but not all-important. Elected officials could still fashion domestic policies affecting jobs, wages, the poverty rate and the availability of homes and cars. Now all of these depend on prevailing interest rates, which in turn depend largely on the Fed.
America used to have a real foreign policy as well, and an apparatus for setting it: a State Department run by people knowledgeable about the politics and societies of places around the globe, as well as a national security adviser and Congressional foreign affairs committees. But now our foreign policy depends largely on global flows of money, and our apparatus for influencing them is almost totally removed from democratic oversight.
Asian economies continue an implosion that began more than a year ago, when money began rushing out in search of safer havens. What had until recently been called the "big emerging markets" of the world are now big submerging markets. Capital flight is, by its very nature, a self-fulfilling prophecy: the last ones out are left holding a near-worthless bag. Much of the money has come to the United States, which is one reason the value of the dollar has soared and the stock market reached astronomical heights this summer. Of course, that was before the high dollar clobbered exports and squeezed corporate profits, causing Wall Street's bubble to burst.
Lower interest rates might help in this capacity; they would make the United States relatively less attractive to global capital, thus relieving some of the pressure on countries on the losing end. Lower rates would also reduce the value of the dollar, easing the plight of American exporters. Cutting rates would also send a signal to central banks abroad that they could lower their own interest rates.
Of course, much of this depends on the other new force in American foreign policy: the International Monetary Fund. For years, in part because of the influence of the Treasury Department, it sought to open other countries' borders to global capital. More recently, and again at the Treasury's urging, it has been trying to stanch capital flight. It has lent developing countries billions of dollars on the condition that they increase domestic interest rates, reduce public spending and deregulate state-run enterprises.
The avowed purpose is to convince global lenders and investors that they should not abandon ship. But the enforced austerity has had perilous social consequences -- driving up prices of food and fuel, increasing unemployment, smothering local businesses and shredding social safety nets.
It's a delicate balance. Without the I.M.F.-imposed austerity even more capital might flee. But those on whom the burden of austerity has fallen most heavily hardly benefited from the huge influx of speculative money to begin with.
The Fed, the I.M.F. and the Treasury are staffed by skilled economists, but can we be sure that the choices they make are the right ones in the eyes of most of the people whose lives are being altered by them? These experts, by and large, have no particular knowledge of politics or sociology and no special insights into what arrangements may be deemed just or unjust in places around the world. Nor are they accountable in ways that might provide them guidance.
Russia's defaulting on its short-term foreign debt last month spooked global creditors who worry about possible defaults elsewhere, especially Brazil. Japan is seemingly paralyzed. The United States remains in fairly good economic shape, but there are worrisome signs: exports continue to drop, consumer confidence has started to dip, and housing starts and commercial property prices are receding.
Officials at the Fed, the I.M.F. and the Treasury are scrambling to contain the problem. President Clinton has asked Congress for $18 billion to shore up the I.M.F., but any such prospect has dimmed in the last few months. He also has asked Mr. Greenspan and Robert Rubin, the Treasury Secretary, to convene a meeting of major central bankers and financial officials to figure out the next steps. But few Americans heard him do it -- we've been too busy parsing his definition of "sexual relations."
The global crisis is too important to be left entirely to central bankers and financial ministers. One reason governments exist is to insure that economies function for the benefit of people, and not the other way around.
In the short term, the Fed should lower interest rates -- by a full percentage point before year's end. There should be a coordinated large-scale reduction in global interest rates. Rather than demanding austerity, the West should allow troubled currencies to fall to some degree. We should slow the flow of hot money now racing across borders, possibly by having countries tax short-term capital flows. The important thing is that any such decisions involve subtle weighings of human needs and social justice.
The global economy is less sexy than what's on most Americans' minds these days. Yet there comes a point when a democracy must attend to what's important rather than to what's titillating.

HEADLINE: U.S. Hedge Fund Bailout Raises Asian Eyebrows

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Sept. 28

 BODY:
In Asia, which has been scolded and sermonized by the United States over its economic policies, there is a sense of grim satisfaction at the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management L.P., and at its $3.65 billion rescue by a team of banks and brokerage firms.
Business leaders here noted that after prodding Asian governments from Japan to Indonesia to increase the openness of their financial institutions, the United States was bushwhacked by the calamitous losses at one of its own big hedge funds. And after urging Asia not to bail out its sinking banks, the United States did something suspiciously close to that with Long-Term Capital. 
 Although the money was put up by banks rather than taxpayers, the bailout was engineered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
"It showed us that the Americans could easily ignore their own principles," said Tadashi Nakamae, a prominent economist and the president of Nakamae International Economic Research in Tokyo.
American policy makers and economists have regularly declared that Asian countries would rebound more quickly from the economic crisis if they allowed at least some of their troubled banks to fail. By pumping money into the financial sector, the American experts warn, the Asian countries are simply delaying the cleansing change that their economies must undergo.
Now, with Long-Term Capital, American regulators faced the same question of whether to allow a major financial player go belly up. Some experts here are unsympathetic to the argument that a bankrupt Long-Term Capital would have unhinged financial markets around the world.
"Of course, if L.T.C.M. fails, there would be a lot of negative chain reactions," Mr. Nakamae said. "But to me, that has nothing to do with systemic risk. It is simply a failure of the speculative chain."
Some people likened last week's rescue to a "convoy" -- a pejorative term that describes the Japanese practice of asking strong banks to bail out weaker ones, with the result that neither bank ends up healthy.
Nevertheless, few people here are gloating over a high-flying investment fund that crashed to earth -- even one based in Greenwich, Conn. It hits too close to home in Asia, which has seen many of its top investors wiped out in the financial crisis. As it happens, few Asian banks had invested heavily in Long-Term Capital. Among those that put up the minimum $10 million to join: Bank of China.
David Li, the chairman of Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong, said several wealthy individuals in Hong Kong had invested in Long-Term Capital, and had called him to ask nervously about the prospects of getting their investment back.
Even if the fund's near-collapse might not have crushed global markets, people here said it could have unnerved fragile investors.
"If this fund were allowed to fail, it would have affected the confidence of investors," said Paul R. Lowndes, the secretary of the Hong Kong Association of Banks. "If you get something too large, with too many dependencies, you may need to overcome your tendency not to intervene."
Mr. Lowndes said the hedge fund's near-death experience would have a beneficial effect if it woke up American policy makers to the risks of these largely unregulated investment pools, which typically use arcane calculations to place huge bets on the movements of interest rates and foreign currencies.
Hedge funds have become a local obsession in Hong Kong, where the government has blamed them for manipulating its currency and stock markets. Last month, the government intervened massively in the stock market in a campaign to punish what it described as a cabal of overseas hedge funds.
Sir Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's financial secretary, has set off on a three-week tour of Europe and the United States to urge policy makers to adopt stricter regulations and oversight of hedge funds. In remarks to reporters over the weekend, Sir Donald said Long-Term Capital would help his case.
"Sentiment has changed around the world on what we should do about monitoring the flow of major hedge funds," he said. "One thing is quite clear: Whether you are a skeptic or a supporter, we have a common problem and we need resolution because it is going to affect each one of us."
In addition to buying shares, Sir Donald curtailed short-selling -- or the selling of borrowed shares -- and trading of futures contracts. He has declined to identify which foreign hedge funds were active in the Hong Kong market.
Malaysia has also cited overseas hedge funds as one of the reasons it recently imposed sweeping capital controls on its markets. Government officials said the sudden huge flows of money into and out of Malaysia were making a mockery of its efforts to stabilize its currency and revive the economy.
"The financial world is dominated by those with big bucks, and those guys can invest a small sum to make sure we don't succeed," said Noordin Sopiee, the chairman of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies, a research group in Kuala Lumpur that advised the Government on its controls.
For all the ill will toward hedge funds, people here acknowledge that foreign investment funds are not the root cause of their economic distress. Most agree that Asian countries must overhaul their ailing commercial banks if they want to restore the confidence of investors. And few expect Asia's governments to use the rescue of Long-Term Capital as a justification for further bailouts.
Indeed, today, Japan's ruling and opposition parties reached an accord on banking reform that may set the stage for landmark legislation. Among the provisions: the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will not pour more Government money into Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the country's largest and most troubled banks, to keep it afloat.
"Stemming the problems of one hedge fund is easy to do," said the head of research at a major foreign bank in Tokyo.
"But Mrs. Watanabe doesn't have her deposits in a hedge fund," he said, referring to a name for the ubiquitous Japanese housewife. "Mrs. Watanabe has her deposits in a bank."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
TradingIs on Hold Pending Rate News

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday, as traders and investors awaited an announcement, expected this afternoon, that the Federal Reserve policy makers have decided to lower short-term interest rates.
The gains recorded during the session were confined to blue-chip and large-capitalization stocks. Broader market measures were weaker. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80.07, or 1 percent, to 8,108.84, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 1,048.69, up 3.94.
But the Nasdaq composite index fell 4.37, to 1,739.22. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.01, to 368.01.
"The market is running into a level of resistance at between 8,100 and 8,300 on the Dow," said one trader, who asked not to be identified. "Even if the Fed cuts rates, there are still worries about Brazil, still worries about more fallout from Long-Term Capital" Management, the troubled hedge fund that is receiving a $3.65 billion bailout.
Anticipation of an interest rate cut has been building for weeks. But confidence that the Fed will move quickly to protect the economy from the effects of financial turmoil overseas reached a higher level late last week, following Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the central bank.
"The language Mr. Greenspan used was very forthright," Jeffrey Applegate, the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, said. "Right now people are marking time, debating if the Fed will cut rates by one-quarter of a percentage point, or by one-half a point."
The Federal funds rate, which is used by commercial banks as a benchmark to determine the interest charges paid by millions of consumers and businesses on short-term debt, has been 5.5 percent since March 1997.
Mr. Applegate and others said that a quarter-point cut in the Federal funds rate was already built into stock market prices. They agreed that failure by the Fed to cut rates by at least that much would get a harsh market reception.
"If the Fed doesn't move, it would be a material negative," said Michael Molnar, a managing director in retail sales and trading at Salomon Smith Barney.
But Mr. Molnar and others said a more dramatic move, such as a half-point cut, might be overly aggressive, and send the wrong signal.
Expectation of interest rate relief is not confined to the United States. Latin markets, which would benefit from a cut in American interest rates, posted gains yesterday. And price gains were widespread on European and Asian equity markets.
Concerns about the stability of the financial system were heightened last week after a group of the world's most powerful commercial and investment banks agreed to prevent Long-Term Capital Management L.P. from failing by pumping $3.65 billion into the hedge fund.
Rumors persisted yesterday that another hedge fund was on the brink of bankruptcy, and that talk hurt a number of brokerage stocks. Lehman Brothers fell 3 1/8, to 30 1/8, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter dropped by 3 3/8, to 49 1/4.
Big consumer stocks, which have been pummeled over concerns about the effect slumping Asian economies will have on earnings, did better. Procter & Gamble rose 3 1/8, to 73 5/8. Gillette, which announced after the market closed that it would lay off 11 percent of its work force, rose 1 11/16, to 40. Colgate-Palmolive jumped 3 3/16, to 72 5/8. Coca-Cola, which told analysts last week that earnings were slowing, rose 1 1/16, to 57 1/4.

Treasury Prices Fall
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices fell in sluggish trading yesterday, as investors awaited today's meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers.
If the Fed lowers short-term rates by at least a quarter-point, as widely expected, "it unwinds the flight to safety," said Eric Peterson, who helps manage $545 million at Talon Asset Management Inc. Treasury prices have risen sharply as investors seek a haven from tumbling stocks and uncertain global markets.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 11/32, to 105 17/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.14 percent, from 5.12 percent on Friday.
Trading tapered off as prices slipped. By 3 P.M., about $49.4 billion of Treasuries traded -- 18 percent below the average Monday of the last month, according to Govpx, a bond-pricing service.
The Treasury sold $16 billion of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills at its regular weekly auction. Following are the results of the auction:

HEADLINE: Worldwide Rebound Seen in Chip Sales

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 28

 BODY:
Worldwide sales of computer chips are expected to rise 12 percent in 1999, rebounding from a decline of 6 percent this year, according to a market research group.
The Dataquest research unit of the Gartner Group said today that weak demand in Asia and volatility in the market for memory chips would hamper results in the first half of 1999 but sales would probably pick up in the second half. Total revenue from computer chips is expected to increase to $155 billion in 1999. 
 Revenue from chips used in computers, consumer electronics and other devices has fallen as prices plummeted, demand waned and too much manufacturing capacity came on line. That, on top of the economic turmoil in Asia, which had been a key market, has resulted in weaker earnings for most chip makers.
"Despite the positive growth we anticipate for 1999, the industry still faces a stiff challenge," George Shiffler, an analyst at Dataquest, wrote in the report."

HEADLINE: Building a Bridge, a Theater Troupe From the U.S. Is Embraced by Havana

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Sept. 28

 BODY:
The veteran actors from Repertorio Espanol had performed the play "Broken Eggs" dozens of times before, in New York City, but on Sunday they took the stage here with the nervousness of beginners. One feared that she would become so emotional she would lose her concentration. Another said he was terrified that he would open his mouth and nothing would come out.
But when the lights finally came on, the actors managed to keep their composure as an audience of 300 people applauded each time a familiar face came on stage, shrieked with laughter at lines like "Do you remember when we used to think Fidel was sexy?" and sprung to their feet for a final standing ovation. 
 In a show that had the quality of a special, almost stolen moment, Cuba welcomed the first Cuban-Americans invited here since the two countries severed relations in 1961, some returning to the same stage where they worked before their exile.
Of the company's nine actors, seven are Cuban-Americans. Among them is a singer-actress returning to the island for the first time in 38 years, a gay actor who was among those labeled "undesirable" and sent to farm camps in the 1960's, a television actress who fled on the 1980 boatlift from Mariel and two young American-born actors discovering the homeland of their parents.
And in the audience were relatives and strangers, friends and old colleagues who knew some of the actors from work in Cuban theater and radio half a century ago. Some said they recognized as their own the idiosyncrasies in "Broken Eggs," a nostalgia-filled comedy about a three-generation Cuban family living in California.
"Cuba is their land and is always present in their lives," said Georgina Almanza, 65, an actress who walked out of the theater sniffling.
"Broken Eggs" ("Revoltillo" in Spanish) opened here in a cultural exchange that underscores how a rapprochement that has been elusive in the political arena is being accomplished through the arts.
The exchanges are allowed under the American economic embargo as "people to people" contacts, which American officials favor as a way of exposing Cubans to a democratic society, and the Cubans to foster goodwill in hostile territory. They have become increasingly common, although more Cubans have crossed over to the United States than American counterparts to Cuba. In the first seven months of this year 183 Cuban artists visited the United States but only 9 Americans visited Cuba, mostly to explore future exchanges.
While American theater groups have come here in the past, and a major New York City producer is expected soon for talks about bringing a hit Broadway musical to Havana next year, most recent contact has been through Repertorio Espanol, a 30-year-old nonprofit company in Manhattan. The company is led by Gilberto Zaldivar, its co-founder and producer, who returned to Cuba in 1995 after a 34-year absence and epitomizes the more conciliatory stance many exiles adopt toward Cuba after renewing old ties.
Although Mr. Zaldivar was drawn here by the illness of two uncles, that visit led to contacts in the theater community and the first cultural exchange -- Cubans working with Repertorio Espanol in New York in 1996. Others Cuban performances in New York followed before the group won permission from both Governments to bring here, by invitation from the Union of Writers and Artists, what Mr. Zaldivar and his associate producer, Robert Weber, consider the best play by the Cuban-born playwright Eduardo Machado.
Mr. Machado, who left Cuba when he was 8, has scheduled his own return on Tuesday, when the company is scheduled to play in Matanzas as part of a 10-day, three-city tour.
"It's only natural that this takes place," Mr. Zaldivar said. "It's logical, normal and human that these two Cuban communities communicate. We can significantly help create the climate for future relations."
The pioneering exchange came at a cost, however: one of Repertorio's Cuban-American board members resigned in protest, and there have even been death threats from those who favor isolating the island to cause its Government's downfall.
Much of the anger focused on Ana Margarita Martinez-Casado, a well-known actress from the 1970's American television sitcom "Que Pasa, U.S.A.?" who lost an advertising contract with a Miami hospital over the Cuba visit.
Ms. Martinez-Casado, who started her career here as a soprano on television, left in 1960 with her 2-year-old daughter, never returning from a job in Puerto Rico after the man who was then her husband warned her from Cuba that the political situation was getting worse. She lived in Mexico, Miami and now New York City, and saw her mother only when she visited Mexico once. Her father died in 1989, followed by her mother two years later, without ever seeing her again. "For many years we thought, things will change soon, and the years kept passing by," she said, citing political, economic and work-related reasons for not coming to Cuba before now. "There comes a point where one asks, 'Why not go?' "
Last week, at Havana's airport, she held the two brothers she had not seen in 38 years in a tight embrace.
"You look just like Papi did when I left," she told one brother, Luis, 64, a Cuban diplomat, through tears. "And you, who used to look like him, now look more like my mother," she told Manuel, 63, a beer company salesman whose own daughter and two sons have also left Cuba and live in Miami.
Manuel Martinez-Casado, calling her Chuchi, an endearing nickname she had not heard in a long time, told her, "I want to hear you sing."
As Ms. Martinez-Casado was driven through old haunts she barely recognized -- past revolutionary slogans on billboards and posters of Pope John Paul II on Old Havana's front doors, through the time warp of Chevrolets and Fords from the 1940's and 50's and with a cemetery stop to bid a belated goodbye to her parents -- troupe members like Ricardo Barber, 61, got reacquainted with once inseparable colleagues.
At a welcoming reception by the artists' union, Mr. Barber chatted with Ana Molinet, 56, an actress who once waged a three-month campaign, including slipping a note to Fidel Castro during a public appearance, to get Mr. Barber released from an agricultural camp for homosexuals and other victims of political persecution.
Mr. Barber spent a year cutting cane from dawn to dusk before he was released and went back to the theater, but he chose to leave Cuba for good in 1977. His first visit back was in 1995, with Mr. Zaldivar. "I wasn't the same" after the forced labor, Mr. Barber said. "I no longer believed in the revolution and I began to see the bad in everything."
While the arts have flourished under Communist rule, benefiting from Government sponsorship and a national system of specialized schools, the Cuban-Americans have found an artistic class hobbled by the economic problems of the country, despite the privileged status of a few. Television programming has been cut back to conserve energy. Films are limited to two or three a year, often co-productions with other countries.
And many theaters have closed, while those that remain are often shabby and inadequately equipped.
Still, tourism and travel have created new opportunities for artists, and officials consider those who tour abroad to be ambassadors who "foment understanding, make us known and favor dialogue," said Ismael Gonzalez, a deputy minister of culture. Artists who travel internationally are also an important source of revenue (although exchanges with the United States are governed by embargo restrictions on both earnings and spending), but individuals' allegiances to the Government vary.
"Most of them keep quiet and make art," a Western official here noted. Carlos Padron, a playwright who presides over the 1,600-member Association of Stage Artists, said the exchanges mostly answer to a yearning for knowing how the other side lives. "Six of 10 Cubans have family in the United States," he said. "People want to see what really happens to people over there, how they insert themselves in North American society, to what extent they maintain their identity."
Repertorio members have been the toast of the town here, enjoying favorable press coverage, welcoming receptions and a quick sellout of shows (tickets have sold for the equivalent of 25 cents). But a company member's cousin was arrested and briefly detained for staying overnight in the relative's hotel and another Repertorio member on a beach outing had to talk a traffic officer out of arresting a friend suspected of being an unauthorized chauffeur. Cubans are not allowed in hotels as guests, and vigilance appears heightened since last year's hotel bombings.
Reluctant to delve into politics or criticize their hosts, some Repertorio members instead talked about their hope to create bridges for eventual democratic change in Cuba, and at times seemed in awe of their compatriots.
"Their spirit of struggle fascinates me," said Rene Sanchez, 71, who had an acting career here before leaving in 1966. "How they invent things, how they try to figure out a better living, how they don't allow themselves to collapse even in the worst of times."
The last could also be said for Repertorio members. Hurricane Georges and immigration problems delayed the arrival of some of the actors and caused the cancellation of the two first Havana shows this weekend. Then, for the first of two scheduled performances on Sunday, the actress Tatiana Vecino got sick and a Cuban actress, Adria Santana, stepped in to read the role.
By evening, the Teatro Hubert de Blanck filled up again for the second show. Ms. Vecino recovered and returned to her role. But at intermission it was announced that the rest of the performance would be canceled. An electric transformer on the street had shorted out and the theater was forced to shut off its power.
The theatergoers were told more performances would be added next weekend, and many had already seen enough to come back for more.
"It was thrilling," said Osmara Velazquez, 54, a cousin of Mr. Zaldivar's. "Incredibly, culture has ended the separation."
