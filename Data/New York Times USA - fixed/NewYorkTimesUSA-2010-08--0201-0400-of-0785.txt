HEADLINE: China and the I.M.F.

 BODY:
A growing list of countries -- from the United States to the European Union to Brazil -- have complained that China has been cheapening its currency. So it is positive news -- of a sort -- that China agreed to submit this year to the International Monetary Fund's annual review of exchange rate and economic policies. 
But nobody should interpret this as a major shift in policy. Indeed, the fund's economists reported last week that ''the renminbi remains substantially below the level that is consistent with medium-term fundamentals.''
The new openness means China is more comfortable that it can get away with the manipulation. It agreed to the review only after the fund softened its standards for determining whether countries are manipulating their exchange rate to boost exports, in violation of I.M.F. rules, and to give countries like China ''the benefit of any reasonable doubt'' when evaluating their policies.
True, China has relied less on exports to fuel growth since the financial crisis started. This defused some criticism of its currency policy. Its trade surplus fell by half in the last two years as recession forced many countries to slash their imports while China's fast recovery boosted its own imports, aiding growth overseas. And in June it said it would allow the renminbi to gradually inch upward against the dollar.
Unfortunately, some of that will be short-lived. Even through the global downturn, China's share of world exports grew to nearly 10 percent. China's exports are now rebounding, and its trade surplus is expected to bottom out this year. Since the announced policy change, its currency has risen little against the dollar and has actually lost value against the euro and the Japanese yen.
The I.M.F. seems to view the outlook as a glass half full. Its executive board welcomed the change in China's currency policy, and ''a number'' of its directors -- which in fund-speak means 6 to 9 out of 24 -- disagreed with the staff's view that the renminbi is undervalued.
This tolerant attitude is probably wise. Retaliating against China with punitive trade barriers, as urged by some in Congress, would spark a tit-for-tat confrontation that would endanger economic recovery. China also is doing other things -- increasing pension payments and unemployment checks, and providing subsidies for college education and purchases of homes and durable goods -- in order to increase domestic consumption and reduce reliance on exports.
Yet China cannot be left off the hook. The I.M.F. must monitor China's trade surplus to assess its drag on global demand. If the fund's economists are proved right, its executive board should reassess its conclusions, call a manipulator a manipulator, and persuade the international community to make China stop.

HEADLINE: He Took a Bullet for New York, but His Legacy Has Faded

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Most New York City mayors are typically booed at ballgames, but fortunately only one, William J. Gaynor, was wounded in an attempted assassination. It happened a century ago on Monday.
The bullet, fired by a disgruntled former municipal employee, remained lodged in Gaynor's neck. Three years later, suffering from the lingering effects of the wound, he succumbed to a heart attack - the only mayor of modern New York to die in office.
Although nominated by the Tammany machine in 1909, Gaynor emerged as a fiercely independent reformer. He fought police use of excessive force and corruption (though Police Lieut. Charles Becker would be convicted during Gaynor's tenure of ordering the murder of the gambler Herman Rosenthal). He championed mass transit. He abolished East River bridge tolls. 
Few tangible signs of his legacy endure, though.
Astoria Park was promptly named in his honor, but Tammany aldermen later rescinded the designation. A Brooklyn intermediate school that bore his name was closed last year. With City Hall being renovated, his official portrait, which usually hangs on the third floor, is in storage.
A memorial to the former mayor still stands in Brooklyn's Cadman Plaza. And a plaque that he presented to St. Mary Hospital in Hoboken, N.J., where he was treated after the shooting, was found a few years ago by Michael Miscione, the Manhattan borough historian, in the basement of a Brooklyn building belonging to the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor. It's on loan to the Museum of the City of New York, where it is on display.
Born upstate in 1851, Gaynor became a reporter for The Brooklyn Argus. As a lawyer who lived in Park Slope (as mayor, he would typically walk to City Hall) and as a candidate for the State Supreme Court, he challenged John Y. McKane, the omnipotent Coney Island party boss, who was later convicted of criminally thwarting democracy. Gaynor was considered incorruptible. He literally kicked out of his office politicians who tried to buy his support.
Still, in a rare miscalculation, Tammany nominated him in 1909 against a field that included the publisher William Randolph Hearst. Gaynor won. His inauguration as New York's 97th mayor was his first visit to City Hall.
Seven months later, on Tuesday, Aug. 9, 1910, he boarded the liner Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse for a month-long European vacation. He was posing for photographers and chatting on the deck with well-wishers from his official family and with a fellow passenger, the president of Chile, when he was accosted by John J. Gallagher, who had been fired by the city's docks department a few weeks before as a 25-cents-an-hour night watchman on the East River piers.
Gallagher, a 58-year-old Irish immigrant who lived alone in a boarding house on Third Avenue, had been accused of dereliction of duty. He claimed he was the victim of a conspiracy. He wrote the mayor seeking redress. He also tried to meet with him a few days earlier at City Hall, but was rebuffed with a note that said the mayor ''can do nothing in the matter of which you write.''
''You took the bread and meat out of my mouth,'' Gallagher cried and fired several shots from a .38 revolver, striking the mayor and hitting his sanitation commissioner, William H. Edwards, a 300-pound former Princeton football player, in the arm.
''Tell the people goodbye for me,'' Gaynor gasped, believing that he was mortally wounded.
He was taken to St. Mary, where he recuperated for several weeks. He returned to City Hall on Oct. 3.
The shooting prompted such an outpouring of sympathy that short-lived boomlets of support projected Gaynor for the governorship and even the presidency. But the mayor spurned higher office.
''When a man has gone down into the Valley of the Shadow and looked the specter Death in the face, and said to it, 'I am ready,' nothing in this world looks very large to him,'' Gaynor wrote.
Shortly before the shooting, a constituent had warned him against going around the city unescorted. ''I do no think anyone would do me any harm unless he was a lunatic, and it is hard to guard against lunatics,'' Gaynor replied.
Just after the shooting, Gaynor blamed ''journalistic scoundrels'' for stoking public sentiment against him and creating a climate for violence. (Apparently because Gaynor was ailing, Mr. Gallagher was never tried for shooting the mayor. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for shooting Mr. Edwards and died in 1913 in a state hospital for the insane.)
A former lay member of the lay brotherhood of the Christian Order (he later renounced Catholicism), Gaynor could be secretive, scrappy, ill-tempered and blunt. He did not suffer fools. When he was introduced to a fanatical supporter of Sunday blue laws, a man who affected the title canon, Gaynor refused to shake hands and barked: ''Canon? You're no canon. You're only a popgun.''
Yet a friend also described him as melding ''the methodical persistence of Grant and the tactical genius of Lee.''
Just before sailing for Europe again on Sept. 4, 1913, he delivered a vituperative parting salvo at Tammany and planned an independent re-election campaign. In the meantime, he said, ''I am going to spend two weeks on the ocean where nobody can get at me.'' He died aboard the steamship Baltic on Sept. 10.
Gaynor's body was returned to New York on the liner Lusitania. He was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery.
The following April, a 71-year-old unemployed blacksmith fired at Gaynor's successor, John Purroy Mitchel, in City Hall Plaza, but missed, striking the city's corporation counsel in the cheek instead. In defense, Mr. Mitchel drew his own revolver, which he had become accustomed to carrying (and with which, Mr. Miscione, the historian said, Mitchel once shot a friend in the leg by accident).
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: After Drought, Hope for Shows Made for Web

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- When Illeana Douglas, long active in independent film, wanted to make a show about a Hollywood actress who becomes a cog in a blue-collar wheel, she turned to the Web and to an unusual ally, Ikea.
She persuaded Ikea, the Swedish furniture maker, to be the sole sponsor of her Web video show, ''Easy to Assemble,'' in which she plays an employee. The most recent episodes, from October through February, drew more than 1.5 million views each month. At home late last month, getting ready for an awards festival where her show would be honored, Ms. Douglas was dressed in a yellow Ikea jumpsuit, mimicking her character. 
''The brand is a co-worker in the story line,'' she said, adding that Ikea does not actually make jumpsuits, so she made one herself.
After a protracted drought, money is trickling back into the professional Web video industry. So-called branded entertainment deals like the one by Ikea are becoming more common, helping to nourish new programming. And venture capital firms are also paying new attention to the industry. My Damn Channel, which distributes ''Easy to Assemble,'' will announce a $4.4 million infusion of financing on Monday, joining companies like Blip.tv and Machinima in raising money this year.
The promise of Web video has risen and fallen over the last few years. What makes the current round of interest more compelling is the realization in the industry that Web video will not supplant television viewing anytime soon, just complement it. That partly explains why the companies have stopped labeling themselves ''TV on the Internet.''
''We realized we were putting a burden on Web-original programming by trying to make it like TV,'' said Lance Podell, the Next New Networks chief executive, who now calls his company a provider of ''Web original programming.''
Its most popular content includes ''The Key of Awesome,'' an Internet-oriented musical comedy show, and ''Indy Mogul,'' a network of shows about do-it-yourself filmmaking.
The Web video industry flies under the radar, but together, the major players rack up hundreds of millions of video views each month. As people spend more time online, producers are betting that video viewing times will keep growing in tandem.
According to the measurement firm comScore, 86 percent of Internet users in the United States now watch at least one online video a month. Some of those shows originate on traditional TV, something that Hulu specializes in; others originate online, and that portion is growing.
''There's an inevitability to Web video that makes it exciting,'' said Rob Barnett, the chief executive of My Damn Channel, which features original comedy and music shows.
Reaffirming its belief in made-for-the-Web programming, YouTube last month announced $5 million in grants for online producers. The grants will seed new content for YouTube, a unit of Google, which has largely failed to persuade big television networks and studios to place TV episodes and films on the site. Encouraging more professional Web video is another way for YouTube to expand its inventory for advertisers.
Despite the evidence that viewers are eager to watch more on the Web, the recession was an ugly reality check for purveyors of such programming, and many start-ups were closed. At My Damn Channel, Mr. Barnett hunkered down, trimmed staff and took solace in the fact that he was seeing repeat business from his existing advertisers like Southern Comfort and HBO, even though he was struggling to add new ones. Now, he says, venture capital will allow him to hire more advertising sales staff, add business development workers and broaden the types of shows he creates.
''I often think of my daily business life as a guy running a cable network in the early 1980s,'' at the dawn of that medium, Mr. Barnett said. ''There is, no matter how you slice it, a timeline for any new industry to grow.''
Web video companies say that advertisers are starting to make million-dollar commitments -- hardly a threat to established television networks, but a big improvement for sites that started out making $5,000 at a time. Commercials in front of professionally produced entertainment videos can command $15 to $35 per thousand views, while banner ads alongside the videos can run $5 to $15 per thousand views.
''All of the distributors we talk to have a shortage of premium video inventory, which seems to indicate that that market has really picked up,'' said Larry Tanz, the chief executive of the independent studio Vuguru, which is backed by Michael Eisner.
The ad revenue is important, but companies like My Damn Channel say they make more money from the branded entertainment deals, which incorporate advertisers into the story lines.
Ms. Douglas would not disclose the amount that Ikea had paid for the two-year-old ''Easy to Assemble,'' though she said the budget had increased for season two and again for season three, which is in production now.
Like most Web shows, her series is produced on a shoestring relative to television or film; her bungalow off Sunset Boulevard still doubles as her production office, and she recalled wincing at the $400 price tag of a portable toilet for one of the on-location scenes last year.
Nonetheless, the cast and crew members are now part of unions, and the show has attracted an impressive slate of guest stars, including Jeff Goldblum and Patricia Heaton. Some people ''want to do this because they're not having fun at their television jobs,'' she said, nursing a cup of tea in her kitchen, where a white MacBook was plugged in. (Yes, she also owns a desk from Ikea.)
Ms. Douglas, who views Web video as a new outlet for artists like herself, said Ikea gave her great autonomy, asking her only to keep the content family-friendly. This summer, she is recruiting a second sponsor, shooting a third season of the show and planning a tour. She would still like to see ''Easy to Assemble'' end up on television, but she is satisfied that she has built a franchise on her own, online.
''Nobody doubts anymore that this is the best way to make entertainment,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Familiar Story in Nevada: Republicans on Offensive

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Midterm election campaigns, by their nature, knit together a diffuse patchwork of story lines. But the Nevada Senate race distills the patterns of 2010 as well as any.
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, is facing mocking attacks from Republicans for asserting that his work with President Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is ''paying off.''
''Paying off for his friends in Washington,'' says a Republican advertisement depicting the three leaders side by side. ''But leaving Nevada with what?'' 
Mr. Reid, using a campaign treasury approaching $20 million, is highlighting the concrete benefits of his power. In one recent advertisement, a Vietnam War veteran injured by Agent Orange declared that a new Veterans Affairs hospital in Nevada ''is being built for one reason - Harry Reid.''
The Democratic leader has reaped one windfall benefit. Conservative Republican primary voters nominated a Tea Party favorite, Sharron Angle, whose past boldness on issues like changing Social Security has raised questions about her viability with swing voters.
Those themes are threaded through competitive contests across the country. Republicans take the offensive, exploiting voters' frustration with Washington and a weak economy. Democrats parry by pointing toward constituent service, hoping that their financial edge and the conservatives' overreach will leave them in control, if only barely, of Capitol Hill.
Seeing 1994 Again
Republicans envision another 1994, when Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia led his party toward Congressional majorities that changed Bill Clinton's presidency. But there are significant differences in the 2010 campaign.
In 1994, Republicans still benefited from the continuing realignment of white Southerners. Southern and border states provided roughly 40 percent of House seats Republicans gained then.
This campaign lacks such a regional concentration. New York, with seven, boasts the greatest number of House seats in play, said a political analyst, Charlie Cook; of 12 endangered Democratic-held Senate seats, just one - Blanche Lincoln's in Arkansas - is in the South.
Democrats reduced their exposure by limiting the number of House members retiring to 20, fewer than in 1994. But more Republican opportunities come from the 48 House seats held by Democrats in districts that voted for John McCain in 2008.
Moreover, Mr. Obama's agenda has provided Republicans with a diverse array of targets. Mr. Clinton's economic plan was a principal focus for Republicans in 1994, but his controversial health plan never reached the House floor and forced Democrats to take a stand.
Vulnerable incumbents this year have had to vote on four contentious major issues: economic stimulus, energy, health care and financial regulation. Some, like Representatives Mary Jo Kilroy and Steve Driehaus of Ohio, sided with Mr. Obama on all four.
Those issues have fed a conservative reaction against rising deficits and bigger government. And they've emboldened Republican candidates to place Mr. Obama in the crosshairs of their television advertisements.
''I don't think anybody's afraid to put Obama in their ads,'' said Evan Tracey, who runs a company that monitors political advertising. Instead of allusions to the president as a machine-style Chicago politician, which critics used to invoke, Mr. Obama is generally cast as a ''dangerous radical,'' Mr. Tracey said.
Democratic Assets
Conveying close connections with local sensibilities is one way Democrats seek to defuse accusations of radicalism.
In Arizona, Mr. Obama's ally, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, wields a hometown ally of her own: Warner Glenn, a deep-voiced, white-haired rancher, who declares in an advertisement that she ''gets it'' on toughening immigration policy. The advertisement doesn't mention Mr. Obama, or the Democratic Party.
Mr. Obama aims to reframe the campaign from a referendum on his performance to a choice between his agenda and that of President George W. Bush, who left office with far lower approval ratings than Mr. Obama's current 40-something standing. It's in that reframing that Democrats hope to leverage benefits from energy on the political right.
In the Nevada and Kentucky Senate races, the primary victories by Ms. Angle and Rand Paul over mainstream alternatives favored by party leaders have lifted Democratic hopes. In the House, Democratic operatives cite more than 100 conservative third-party candidates who could siphon votes from challengers to Democratic incumbents like as Representative Tom Perriello in Virginia.
Campaign cash represents another Democratic asset - at least for now. Mr. Reid had raised more than five times as much as Ms. Angle's $3.5 million through the end of June; the 42 most endangered Democratic incumbents, the party's campaign committee calculated using Federal Election Commission reports, had an average cash-on-hand edge of $768,272 over their Republican opponents.
But money is often insufficient to ward off a political tidal wave, and the Democrats' advantage may narrow amid rising expectations of Republican gains.
''Clearly they have an edge,'' Mr. Tracey said. ''I'm not sure it'll be sustained at the end.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Connecticut, a New Level of Intensity for Primaries

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Democratic and Republican voters go to the polls in Connecticut on Tuesday to pick their party's nominee for governor in tight primary contests that pit establishment politicians against wealthy candidates in both parties who are bankrolling their own campaigns.
On the Democratic side, Ned Lamont, a multimillionaire businessman who ran an unsuccessful Senate bid in 2006, is locked in an increasingly bitter fight with Dannel P. Malloy, a former mayor of Stamford, the state's fourth-largest city. Thomas C. Foley, a major Republican Party fund-raiser and an ambassador under President George W. Bush, leads the Republican field but is facing a spirited challenge from Lt. Gov. Michael C. Fedele for the party's nomination. 
The ferocity of the campaigns underscores the enormous opportunity that individuals in both parties see as a result of Gov. M. Jodi Rell's unexpected decision this year to not seek re-election. Mrs. Rell, a Republican, took office in 2004 after the resignation of Gov. John G. Rowland, who served 10 months in prison after pleading guilty to corruption charges.
Mrs. Rell, who was lieutenant governor under Mr. Rowland, was subsequently elected on her own in 2006. ''This is the first time in 20 years that the governorship is open with no incumbent defending it,'' said Christopher C. Healy, the chairman of the state Republican Party. ''That has created a new cast of players in both parties and a new level of intensity.''
And yet for all that, the contest for governor has been largely eclipsed by the race for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat and the longest-serving senator in Connecticut history. The race for Mr. Dodd's seat has drawn national attention, as both political parties in Washington fight for control of the Senate this campaign season.
While independent analysts once thought Democrats had a strong shot at holding the seat, the race is now considered highly competitive. Republican voters head to the polls on Tuesday to select their party's nominee in that race. Linda E. McMahon, the World Wrestling Entertainment impresario who has spent more than $20 million of her own money, is considered the front-runner.
Rob Simmons, a former congressman who suspended his campaign in May, jumped back into the Republican Senate primary race last month in the hopes of pulling off an upset victory. A third candidate, Peter Schiff, a financier who boasts of having predicted the economic meltdown, is also on the ballot with a following among people who lean libertarian.
The winner of the Republican Senate primary will face the presumptive Democratic nominee, Richard Blumenthal, who is also the state's five-term attorney general. Recent polls indicate that the significant lead that Mr. Blumenthal once enjoyed has eroded amid disclosures that he misrepresented his military record -- and a fierce advertising campaign by Ms. McMahon to exploit the issue.
The vacancy in the governor's mansion represents a significant opportunity for Democrats, who have not controlled the governor's office since William A. O'Neill held the office from 1980 to 1991. With the race entering its final days, the candidates seeking the Democratic Party's nomination, Mr. Lamont and Mr. Malloy, have hammered away at each other, underscoring the closeness of the race.
Mr. Lamont, the founder of a telecommunications company who is widely known for his attempt to oust Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in 2006, has accused Mr. Malloy of awarding contracts as mayor of Stamford to companies that helped him raise money or that undertook renovations on his home.
The Malloy campaign has called the attacks false and sleazy. In 2005, a state investigation found no evidence that city contractors got preferential treatment for performing work on Mr. Malloy's house. Mr. Malloy, who vowed to use his municipal experience to turn the fiscally troubled state around, has tried to undercut a central case Mr. Lamont has made for being governor: his success as a businessman.
Mr. Malloy has said that Mr. Lamont reduced his company work force by 70 percent, and he has highlighted a discrimination lawsuit that was brought against Mr. Lamont's company, Lamont Digital Systems. Justine Sessions, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lamont, dismissed the attacks, saying that Mr. Malloy was repeating ''the same false attacks Lieberman used against Ned and his company four years ago.''
Mr. Lamont has a significant financial advantage over Mr. Malloy. Mr. Lamont has pumped about $8.6 million of his own money into the race, while Mr. Malloy is relying on $2.5 million he received by opting to take part in the state's public-finance program.
The Republican primary for governor is equally competitive. Polls show that Mr. Foley, who was ambassador to Ireland under Mr. Bush, holds a lead over Mr. Fedele, the lieutenant governor. But Mr. Fedele has been closing the gap, with a large number of voters who remain undecided. A third Republican candidate, Oz Griebel, a businessman from the Hartford area, is also on the ballot.
Even as Mr. Foley cites his success as a businessman as a reason to vote for him, Mr. Fedele has sought to use his record in business against him. In one advertisement, Mr. Fedele features residents of a Georgia factory town who say Mr. Foley bankrupted the business while enriching himself.
''Public polling confirms that Mike Fedele has all the momentum in this tightening contest, and our internal polls show the race as a dead heat,'' said Jim Conroy, a spokesman for Mr. Fedele. ''Voters are fleeing Tom Foley as they learn about his bankrupting the largest textile manufacturer in the country.''
Liz Osborn, a spokeswoman for Mr. Foley's campaign, accused Mr. Fedele of resorting to ''untruthful attacks'' in the last weeks of the campaign.
Mr. Foley, who captured the state party's endorsement during the party convention in May, has blamed Mr. Fedele for the state's dire fiscal situation, including the multibillion-dollar deficit during his tenure as Mrs. Rell's lieutenant governor. Like Mr. Lamont, Mr. Foley has relied on his own money, funneling $3 million into his campaign, on top of the nearly $800,000 he has raised; Mr. Fedele has been limited to the $2.5 million through the public-finance program he is participating in.

HEADLINE: Debt Problem Has Museum Scrambling

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
The American Folk Art Museum, which has struggled financially almost since the day it opened the doors of its new building in 2001, is now facing a moment of reckoning.
Six months after disclosing that it could no longer make payments on the $32 million it borrowed through a bond issue to finance the building, the museum is still in protracted negotiations to restructure its debt with the company that insured its bonds.
Both sides say they are optimistic they will reach an agreement that will keep the museum in its home on West 53rd Street in Manhattan, which serves as collateral for the debt. 
''It's a process, so I can't tell you exactly what the outcome of it will be, but I think that everybody is operating very conscientiously and in good faith to find a solution to these challenges,'' said Stephen Corelli, the museum's incoming board president.
All bondholders have been paid on time. But for months the museum has been unable to make payments into a debt service fund as required under its agreement with New York City's Trust for Cultural Resources, the public benefit corporation that issued the tax-exempt bonds for the project.
The next payment to bondholders, in January, is to be covered by the bond insurer, ACA Financial Guaranty.
Although its exhibitions of folk and outsider art have been highly praised, the museum has never realized the optimistic attendance and revenue increases projected for it when the new building opened just down the street from the Museum of Modern Art. The money problems only deepened when the museum, like other organizations, suffered crippling investment losses during the financial crisis.
The museum is the first organization to default on an agreement to pay off the bonds issued for it through the trust, which was created to help cultural institutions finance capital projects. Since 1980, when the trust was created, some 20 organizations have borrowed money through it, including MoMA, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the American Museum of Natural History.
The city is not liable for the museum's debt, and the trust only serves as a conduit and administrator for the borrowing, so a single default is unlikely to damage its credibility with potential investors.
One additional complication, though, is that the insurer, ACA, has its own financial issues. It suffered major losses and had to go through a restructuring because of the subprime mortgage crisis and is no longer issuing insurance contracts. Steven Berkowitz, its general counsel, said ACA was in a position to honor its agreements to pay bondholders.
Neither he nor the museum would detail what sort of agreement is being discussed or offered a firm timetable on when negotiations might conclude.
The folk art museum was founded in 1961 and operated out of smaller spaces on West 53rd Street and West 55th Street before constructing its current home, a narrow, 30,000-square-foot bronze-clad building designed by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects. (It also has a branch at Lincoln Square, for which it pays $1 a year in rent to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.)
The collection contains large amounts of Americana, although Mr. Corelli said that the museum hopes to show people that folk art ''isn't just quilts and weathervanes.'' Among its holdings of outsider, or self-taught, art are two dozen works and a substantial archive of materials from Henry Darger. The museum's contemporary curator, Brooke Davis Anderson, who has organized several Darger shows, was recently hired away by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to be a deputy director; the folk art museum is planning to replace her.
For several years the museum displayed a painting from Edward Hicks's ''Peaceable Kingdom'' series, a promised gift from Ralph O. Esmerian, one of the museum's biggest patrons and its board president from 1977 to 1999. But Mr. Esmerian had also used the painting as collateral on a loan, and when he ran into financial difficulties it was auctioned off in 2008.
The New York City commissioner of cultural affairs, Kate D. Levin, who is an ex-officio member of the trust board, said the museum's financial situation was not dire.
''They are making strides in terms of their financial health,'' she said.
The museum's director, Maria Ann Conelli, said that, with layoffs and other measures, the museum had cut its budget to $7 million for the 2011 fiscal year, down from $8.5 million in 2010 and $10.3 million in 2009.
Among the other cost-cutting measures, the museum has ceased publication of Folk Art Magazine, which went to members, and has begun publishing some of its exhibition catalogs only online. It also decided to stop leasing auxiliary office space on East 52nd Street.
Over the years attendance and revenue figures have fallen far short of the projections made while the new building was being constructed. At that time it was predicted that attendance would reach 255,000 a year by 2005 and generate $1.7 million in revenue.
Actual attendance was half that in 2005, and attendance today, though growing, remains at 160,000 a year. Admission revenue was $306,000 in the 2009 fiscal year, according to the museum's draft financial statements.
The cost of operating the building, meanwhile, has been higher than expected, and the museum's tax returns show that in recent years expenses have outpaced revenue. Net assets, which were $26 million in June 2002, had dropped to $3.1 million by June 2009.
One additional revenue source, Mr. Corelli said, may be the sale of the museum's air rights to Hines, the developer of the planned Jean Nouvel tower on West 53rd Street. Hines has postponed the development of its building, however, because of conditions in the commercial real estate market.
''We've had growing pains,'' Mr. Corelli said. ''But what this crisis has really forced us to do is take a hard look at our operating profile. I think the result is we will be a leaner, smarter, more efficient organization.''

HEADLINE: Odors and Oddities of the Underground

BYLINE: By DANIEL M. GOLD

 BODY:
As a topic for crowdsourcing, there could hardly be a better subject than New York's subways. Who doesn't have a story, or 10, to tell about something they've seen or someone they've been jammed next to down under? 
''Tales From the Tunnel,'' at the Bleecker Street Theater, gets points for initiative. Troy Diana and James Valletti, who share writing and directing credits, first asked friends and family members for their accounts, then passed out cards to straphangers soliciting theirs. They assembled dozens of sketches, snapshots and one-liners about events underground and even had an inside source: Mr. Valletti's father, a retired Metropolitan Transit Authority employee.
Seen at last year's New York International Fringe Festival, ''Tales From the Tunnel'' benefits from a spare, clever set: folding chairs arranged like the seating on a subway, in that too-familiar orange and mustard color scheme. Each of six actors handles multiple roles, sliding in and out of them as smoothly as the swipe of a MetroCard.
Wilson Jermaine Heredia -- the Tony Award-winning Angel of ''Rent'' -- blends in well with the rest of the ensemble as the Accordion Man, sitting in for all the musicians who make train platforms their stages. Geri Brown is ferocious as the station clerk who has seen it all; just wait, she'll tell you about the bad day she's having. Also memorable: Vayu O'Donnell, as a homeless man who explains how he has come to live in the West Fourth Street station; Farah Bala, as a lady who lunches now forced by the recession to travel underground; Carla Corvo and Brandon Jones, as a match made on the D line.
Yet for all their roles, the actors are not called on to do too much; the show, intent on remaining gently amusing, does not take enough risks. Mr. Valletti and Mr. Diana have decided to keep it relentlessly light, like a cable-ready sitcom.
There's plenty of the predictable: drunks and scammers and too-public displays of affection. But when tackling fear or alienation, say, the results mostly feel false; few skits address truly intense situations. There are nods to Sept. 11, and a couple of contrived confrontations. Then it's off to another bit involving body odors or bathroom humor.
The subway is New York, just below the surface. In the end ''Tales From the Tunnel'' shortchanges its subject.
''Tales From the Tunnel'' is at the Bleecker Street Theater, 45 Bleecker Street, East Village; (212) 239-6200, talesfromthetunnel.com.

HEADLINE: In Superman's Hometown, A Labor Dispute Over Health

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

 BODY:
Union workers at the nation's only uranium conversion plant, in Metropolis, Ill., have erected 42 crosses nearby in memory of workers who died of cancer. Twenty-seven smaller crosses symbolize workers who have survived the disease.
The memorial is a fitting backdrop for the contentious labor dispute that has shaken Metropolis -- the self-proclaimed hometown of Superman, which sits on the Ohio River at the southern edge of Illinois. Many workers believe that the plant contributed to their fellow employees' illnesses, which is a central reason the union is refusing to accept the plant operator's plan to reduce pensions for newly hired workers and health benefits for retirees.
On June 28, Honeywell, the plant operator, locked out its 220 union employees after negotiations stalled, accusing the union of refusing to give the company 24 hours' notice of a strike. The union has picketed ever since. 
''We deal with hydrofluoric acid,'' said Darrell Lillie, president of United Steelworkers Local 7-669, which represents the union workers. ''We make fluorine. This is bad stuff. The least we feel like we could have is good medical benefits when we retire.''
Honeywell rejects the notion that its facility makes workers more susceptible to cancer and maintains that its labor proposal would raise the average overall salary for employees. The company says that is fair given that the plant, which converts milled uranium into uranium hexafluoride for nuclear reactors, is projected to lose $20 million this year.
''Unfortunately, the union has demonstrated very little desire to reach a mutually beneficial and workable agreement that acknowledges the economic realities of the plant,'' said Peter Dalpe, a spokesman for Honeywell.
In Metropolis, a blue-collar community of 6,500, Clark Kent has long been the main draw. A 15-foot tall Superman keeps solemn watch outside the county courthouse, and the local newspaper is called The Metropolis Planet. The Chamber of Commerce used to hand out packets of ''kryptonite'' candy to children.
But this summer everyone is concerned about uranium, not kryptonite.
Workers have long feared that the plant poses dangers. According to Honeywell's quarterly financial filings, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department are investigating whether the plant complied with federal law in its storage of sludge. A grand jury has been convened in the matter, the filings said.
Mr. Dalpe said Honeywell was cooperating with the E.P.A. investigation, ''which resulted from a company self-disclosure more than two years ago.''
Federal inspectors have been on-site monitoring the situation, said Roger Hannah, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ''At this point, we're satisfied they've met all safety regulations, and that they have a continued emphasis on safety,'' he said.
In December 2003, an accidental release of uranium hexafluoride sent a plume of gas into the air, and nearby homes were evacuated. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency sued Honeywell over the accident, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued two safety violations, which led to increased oversight.
With the union workers locked out, 152 salaried Honeywell employees have been running the plant and 203 contract workers were brought in from a Louisiana company to help.
''They're trying to bring in old recruits who have been retired and train them to run the plant,'' said Jerry Baird, whose restaurant, Diamond Lil's, has been hauling barbecue, lemonade and ice to the picket line. ''If they remember everything, it'll probably run. If they don't, they'll probably kill us all.''
Mr. Dalpe said Honeywell was not aware of any evidence that pointed toward a higher rate of illness at its Metropolis plant than other facilities.
''Publicly available and independent government health data, including from the Centers for Disease Control, demonstrate conclusively that the cancer incidence rates in counties where our Metropolis employees reside are at or below those of the state of Illinois and the U.S. over all,'' he said.
But because the plant, then called Allied Chemical, produced atomic material for the cold war effort, it is part of the federal government's Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program.
Under the program, the government has paid out $15.2 million in compensation and medical benefits to former workers at the plant or their families. Those workers were determined to have become ill from radiation exposure while working between 1959 and 1976 or suffered residual radiation exposure between 1977 and 2009.
Mr. Dalpe said those payments included claims from more than 30 years ago and do not ''reflect health and safety practices at our Metropolis Works Plant, nor do they indicate a high level of risk for our current employees.''
Meanwhile, labor negotiations are scheduled to resume on Tuesday. But union workers and their families continue to picket around the clock, and a rally was held Saturday.
''In Metropolis, there are friendships and personal ties between company and union employees,'' said Billy McDaniel, the town's mayor. ''It makes it hard, because it splits those relationships. We certainly don't want to lose Honeywell. And we don't want to lose any of our workers.''

HEADLINE: Half the Holes, No Less the Charm

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
PALENVILLE, N.Y. - I am standing near the fifth green at the Rip Van Winkle Country Club, a public nine-hole golf course at the foot of New York's Catskill Mountains. A few minutes ago, a dog lazily pursued a deer across the fairway. They passed two ducks that did not bother to look up.
The course was designed in 1919 by Donald Ross, who laid out the holes beneath a striking mountain ridgeline that remains the setting's dominating feature nearly a century later. Some things, though, have changed in 91 years. Greens fees have increased to $14 on weekdays and $17 on weekends.
It is quiet and busy at the same time at Rip Van Winkle. My 11-year-old son is merrily raking the sand in a bunker after splashing a shot onto the green. O.K., so it took him three tries to get out. He couldn't care less, and neither could the group behind us - wherever they were. 
Golf at America's nine-hole courses is a state of mind. It is golf in its most natural setting, still full of hope but without undue expectation or pretense. You come to play.
Golf at an 18-hole course is as enjoyable and as important. The genius, splendor and tradition of the game's most esteemed full-scale layouts provide a separate joy. And they certainly receive all the attention. There hasn't been a nine-hole golf course listed in Golf Digest's top 100 courses since 1968.
But golf on America's nine-hole courses is too important to ignore. Nine-hole courses have largely escaped big redesigns and gimmicky overhauls. It is the land as it was; it is golf as it was.
We hear that nine-hole courses are on their way to obsolescence, with more than 1,000 closing or converting to 18-hole courses in the last 25 years. There are 4,441 nine-hole golf courses left in the United States, a figure that represents 28 percent of all courses, according to the National Golf Foundation. In 1985, the number was 44 percent. But as the modern golf world grows bigger and longer - be it the size of a typical driver head or how far a ball travels - I have confidence in the permanence of the plucky little nine-hole course.
''As a business model, I much prefer having nine holes,'' said John Smith, who at 34 has become the third generation in his family to run the Rip Van Winkle Country Club - known locally as the Rip.
''Expanding to 18 holes would be the last thing I would do,'' Smith said. ''My taxes, my fuel costs, my employee expenses and my maintenance budget would double. I've known a lot of nine-hole golf courses that have converted to 18 holes. I know for certain that they are not bringing in double my revenue.''
Smith, whose grandfather bought the club in 1949, concedes that potential customers call him every day to ask how many holes the Rip has. When they hear 9 instead of 18, ''sometimes they hang up without saying a word,'' he said. ''We know there's a stigma.''
But he also knows there are people who don't have the time to play 18 holes, and people who can't physically play 18 holes. There are also people who know that playing from his course's two sets of tees alters the driving strategy enough that 18 holes on the same nine feels almost like any other conventional course.
''Some people prefer the more laid-back atmosphere of a nine-hole golf course,'' Smith said. ''They know they're not going to get pushed around here. Nobody is going to hurry you.''
You also never know what you're going to stumble upon at a nine-hole golf course, which is part of the charm. Because many nine-hole courses were built before the advent of heavy machinery, natural features usually remain in play. I have played around and over Revolutionary War-era stone walls that bisect fairways or hide greens. I have played from a tiny island tee box in a tiny pond accessed by a tiny row boat (choose your club wisely, because you're not going back for another). I have played to greens positioned 90 feet below the fairway.
Nine-hole courses also allow golfers to discover the hidden gems of our most noted pre-Depression-era golf architects - all of them cranked out nine-hole courses at a time when 18-hole layouts were the minority.
Several Ross designs have been preserved in New England. Robert Trent Jones's creativity and subtlety are still evident in nine-hole designs from Illinois to New York. The underrated architectural tandem of Wayne Stiles and John Van Kleek made superb nine-hole courses all along the Eastern Seaboard. And in 1924, Seth Raynor, with later help from the high school English teacher turned golf architect Charles Banks, designed the nine-hole course that winds around the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn.
A recent Golf World article ranking the top 25 nine-hole courses in the country listed the Hotchkiss course at No. 22.
Last month, I enjoyed a round at Hotchkiss. It was filled with devilishly sloping fairways, spectacular lake views and a closing-hole par 5 that began in a narrow stand of trees, skirted past a swamp and finished with a serpentine uphill approach to a plateau green. There's a little clubhouse behind the green, and a bunch of regulars waiting to start their weekly league sat on park benches watching as group after group tried to survive the final hole.
When I was done, they seemed to acknowledge the surprise in my eyes, smiling as if to say: And you thought this was just a harmless little nine-hole golf course, didn't you?
It is a fact that more nine-hole golf courses will close, probably by the dozens, in the next decade. More than 100 have closed nationwide in the last 18 months.
Why?
Certainly, not all nine-hole courses are well run, well maintained, well located or well designed in the first place. With the glut of championship-level 18-hole courses built in the 1990s, and with the economic downturn of the last several years, there is a lot of superior golf to be had at discount prices. That has hurt lesser-quality nine-hole courses. And that's all right; our golf choices evolve.
But thousands of distinctive nine-hole courses continue to thrive, like an alternative wing in the house of golf. People go there not to be seen, not for ultrapristine conditions, not for excessive length and certainly not to be wowed by the 19th-hole catalog of $8 beers. They go there to play and, in a sense, to be around others with the same simple aspiration.
The desire and need for a golf course with such a short list of goals - playable, enjoyable, congenial - will never go away. A lot of us began playing on nine-hole courses. A lot of us like to find our way back to them. They are familiar and soothing, like walking through your home's front door after a long trip.
I don't remember what my score was on the fifth hole at the Rip Van Winkle Country Club. I remember the view back up the fairway as the sun put a glow on clouds disappearing behind the mountain ridge. I remember my son making an improbable 30-foot downhill putt, and when he let out a yelp, I remember a fish jumping in a nearby pond. I remembered why I played golf.
In a new On Par video, Bill Pennington explains away his bad golf game.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: High-Speed Broadband in Tasmania

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Mention Tasmania, the island 150 miles south of the Australian mainland, and most people, if they think of anything at all, think of a carnivorous marsupial, the Tasmanian Devil.
But Tasmania is leading Australia's ambitious broadband plan to wire more than 90 percent of the nation's homes with high-speed fiber optics. Today, South Korea and Japan are the leaders in putting fiber networks in homes, with about 40 percent penetration.
The first three communities in Tasmania started getting fiber-to-the-home technology last month, with data speeds starting at 100 megabits per second, or 20 times faster than typical broadband speeds today. 
By 2013, Tasmania plans to have the hyper-speed broadband available to nearly all its 500,000 citizens -- and the government is installing it without charging the users. The plan is for the rollout to be completed throughout Australia five to seven years.
Larry Smarr, a director of California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, calls the Australian policy ''one of the most interesting experiments in the world.''
The Australian government, according to Mr. Smarr, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, sees the ''importance of broadband as part of a nation-building exercise, unlike this country.''
David Bartlett, the premier of Tasmania, certainly regards high-speed broadband as an engine of economic development for his Australian state. Mr. Bartlett was traveling through the United States recently, meeting with major American technology companies, including Microsoft, Google, Apple, Cisco, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard.
His pitch: Tasmania offers high-tech innovators a ''planetary laboratory'' for developing and trying out high-speed broadband applications in fields like health care, education and energy management.
Yet Australia and Tasmania also point to the bumps in the road toward the broadband future. In the first three communities, households are not rushing to get the fiber installed. About half so far have granted permission, apparently concerned about wiring hassles and the uncertain cost of high-speed services.
The government's plan for its high-speed National Broadband Network has also become a point of sharp debate in the run-up to Australia's national election on Aug. 21.
The opposition center-right Liberal-National coalition has declared that, if elected, it will jettison the national fiber-optic rollout, estimated to cost 43 billion Australian dollars (about $39 billion) over several years. A similar program if done in the United States, based on dollars spent per person, would cost nearly $700 billion.
The opposition contends that a less-expensive mix of wireless and broadband technologies can yield comparable economic benefits at far less cost than the ruling Labor Party's plan.
''We make no apology for not matching Labor's monumentally reckless spending in this regard,'' Tony Smith, an opposition spokesman, recently told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard said her opponents would consign the nation's economy, school children and health system to second-class citizenship in the high-tech economy of the future.
''The choice today couldn't be clearer: I will build the National Broadband Network,'' Ms. Gillard said, as quoted by the Associated Press. ''The opposition will not.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Economist Tends Its Sophisticate Garden

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Its fire-engine-red logo peeks out of fashionable handbags and from the back pockets of designer jeans. Bankers read it in first-class seats. Hipsters read it on the subway on their way to work.
It's The Economist.
The newsweekly, a bible of global affairs for those who wear aspirations of worldliness on their sleeves, did not become a status symbol overnight. It took 25 years of clever advertising that tugs at the insecurities and ambitions of the status-seeking reader to help the magazine get there.
A standout among its less successful peers in the shrinking world of weekly news magazines, the true genius of The Economist, in fact, may have as much to do with its marketing as with its authoritative and often sardonic tone on exotic subjects, like a constitutional referendum in Kenya and the history of the vice presidency in Brazil.
Selling a publication with a title that conjures painful memories of college social science requirements can't be easy. But the brand officers at The Economist and the advertising firm BBDO have devised a marketing strategy that makes people think reading the magazine will make them smarter and more sophisticated. 
Their approach has been anything but subtle.
''Once upon a time, there was an ambitious young man who didn't read The Economist. The End,'' read one particularly audacious ad from 2004. Another, from 1988 said, ''I never read The Economist -- Management Trainee. Age 42.'' One from 2001 said, ''Look forward to class reunions.''
The magazine's latest advertising campaign in the United States, being introduced in 11 cities with well-off, well-educated populations, includes two slides that riff on the theme of social advancement. In one, an ostrich has his head buried in the ground. In the second, the bird's head pops up through the ground right under the words ''Get a world view. Read The Economist.''
''They've always implied that if you read The Economist, you'll be just a little bit wiser and smarter than the average guy,'' said Joseph Plummer, an adjunct professor of marketing at Columbia Business School and a former executive at McCann Worldgroup. ''People want to get better most of the time. And I think in the case of The Economist, what they're doing is adding a little bit of a wrinkle by appealing to a second emotion: competitiveness.''
Americans seem to be responding. Since the magazine first began printing a North American edition in early 1981, its circulation has increased more than tenfold. (It has published in Britain, where it has its headquarters, since 1843.)
When The Economist began reporting figures to the Audit Bureau of Circulations in 1982, it printed about 80,000 copies and sold fewer than 8,300 on the newsstand each week. As of its last accounting, for the first half of 2010, the magazine sold an average of about 52,000 on the newsstand each week and had a total weekly circulation of just under 823,000. Newsstand sales, however, are off 9 percent from more than 57,200 in the last six months of 2009, and the number of short-term subscribers is high.
Over the years, other newsweeklies have lost huge blocks of their readerships (Newsweek and Time), reduced the frequency of publication (U.S. News & World Report) or stopped producing a regular print edition altogether (Life).
Newsweek, which was sold last week to a 92-year-old stereo equipment tycoon for virtually nothing after The Washington Post Company said it could no longer afford to keep losing money on the magazine, has slashed its circulation to 1.6 million from about 3.1 million in 2000. Time's circulation has been cut to about 3.3 million from 4.1 million in 2000.
But The Economist has always been a different kind of newsweekly. For one, it is more expensive than most American weeklies, adding to its status-symbol appeal. A yearlong subscription is generally at least $100, versus $39 for Newsweek and $20 for Time.
It is also edited in Britain, giving it a foreign flavor that marketing experts said many readers found alluring.
''This is something that's been written mostly outside the United States,'' said Lars Perner, an assistant professor of clinical marketing at the University of Southern California, who noted the magazine's use of British spellings -- programme and globalisation -- even in its American editions. ''That presumably adds a certain level of sophistication that readers find attractive.''
Despite its success in reaching American readers, The Economist's executives felt there were more buyers to be found.
About four years ago they began focusing on large urban areas like Austin, Seattle, San Francisco and Washington, places that also happen to have well-educated populations that are likely to find The Economist's global perspective appealing.
The magazine's branding executives have also carefully selected what stores can carry it, and not just any supermarket or general merchandise store will suffice. Two they selected were Whole Foods, the high-end, high-price organic food chain, and Costco, a warehouse club.
''Whole Foods is actually a psychographic, not a demographic, said Paul Rossi, The Economist's managing director and executive vice president for the Americas. ''One of the things people say is, 'You go after an affluent audience.' But we don't define our audience by their demographic. We define our audience based on what they think.''
He said that above all else the magazine's marketing tries to stir intellectual curiosity. But he acknowledged that some will inevitably see The Economist as a status symbol. ''For some people it will be a badge, for some it won't,'' he said, adding that the magazine does not intentionally shoot for that image. ''If we ever started to market ourselves to be cool, it would fail.''
But it has clearly become a hip product in some circles. Until recently, The Economist could be bought at, of all places, Freemans Sporting Club, a high-end Greenwich Village boutique that sells $189 plaid button-downs and $396 suede boots. Explained the store's manager, Jesse Johnson, ''We started carrying it because we just felt it was relevant to have.'' The store stopped carrying it, Mr. Johnson added, because it was not selling as well as he had hoped.
The Economist may be one of the biggest success stories among news magazines in the United States in the last 25 years, but its trajectory has slowed lately. Newsstand sales, an important indicator of a magazine's success and a big profit center, have been in sharp decline in recent years -- falling 27 percent from more than 71,000 in 2008.
And 45 percent of Economist subscribers are customers for six months or less, according to the latest circulation figures.
Among its competitors, however, The Economist is hardly alone in losing customers at the newsstand. Single copy sales of The Week, for example, averaged about 3,800 in 2009 but have dipped well below 2,000 for several weeks this year, according to the most recent figures available.
But managers at The Economist do not seem very concerned. John Micklethwait, the editor, said the magazine's long-term success and relevance are only getting stronger in a world that is becoming increasingly global.
''It's much easier to sell a magazine that's as global as what we do in an era when if you live in Detroit, your life can get changed by something that happens in Delhi,'' he said.
As for The Economist's hip factor, Mr. Micklethwait said it had nothing to do with how the magazine was edited. ''Once you start trying to segment and work out what people might want to see, I think that would be a journey to some type of psychological hell.''

HEADLINE: Docks for Apple Gadgets Help a Business Thrive

BYLINE: By ERIC A. TAUB

 BODY:
RAHWAY, N.J. -- In the 1950s and 1960s, Realtone Electronics made transistor radios, one of the must-have gadgets of the era.
But by the 1970s, that gold mine had played out. For the next two decades, the company survived in the electronics business by making clocks for Timex that sold in drugstores and by creatively combining devices. It made the first cassette tape player-clock radio and the first telephone-clock radio.
It struck gold again in this decade with another combination -- speakers with a dock for the iPod music player from Apple. By tapping into the Apple system, the company, now called SDI Technologies, has become the largest supplier of speaker and alarm clock docks. It is also the leading maker of hotel alarm clocks. 
Software developers may chafe at Apple's restrictions and standards for the iPod, iPhone and iPad. But Apple's set-in-stone design requirements actually help companies making speaker docks and rechargers because they know that the placement of the connector will probably not vary from one Apple model to the next. And they are confident that sales of the Apple products will be strong enough that they will lead to large production runs.
In 2005, SDI was trying to figure out how to recreate the company for the digital age. ''I asked one of our designers if he could replace a CD changer from one of our clock radios and let the user wake and sleep from an iPod,'' said Ezra S. Ashkenazi, SDI's president and the son of one of Realtone's founders. ''When I asked that, the karma in the room changed.''
''We recreated the $19.99 drugstore alarm clock radio and turned it into a $100 product,'' Mr. Ashkenazi said.
To increase the likelihood of success with its first Apple accessory, the company purposely mimicked the Apple style in its earliest designs. ''Our instructions to our designers were 'Make it look like Apple designed it,' '' Mr. Ashkenazi said. Its first product, the iH5, was housed in a white plastic case and packaged in a clean box with minimal graphics. ''This was the opposite of our Timex boxes,'' he said.
''This was a real challenge for us. You get no help from Apple except for specs and requirements. We knew we had something big when stores mistakenly called our products 'iHome by Apple,' '' Mr. Ashkenazi said.
It transformed the private company, now run by the children and grandchildren of the men who started the company near the foot of Fifth Avenue in New York. It gets the bulk of its revenue from its 20 types of iPod and iPhone audio accessories.
With 20 percent of the speaker dock market, the company has twice the market share of Sony, its nearest competitor. It also dwarfs Memorex, iLive and Bose.
''IHome has done a good job keeping pace and growing their portfolio,'' said Ross Rubin, director of industry analysis at the research firm NPD. ''They established the clock dock category and created many variations.''
Not that the company has not made mistakes. An under-the-counter kitchen iPod dock failed to attract customers. ''It was expensive, and you had to drill under a cabinet to install it,'' Mr. Ashkenazi said.
In the hotel market, though, the company has placed more than two million alarm clocks with iPod and iPhone docks in almost 40 percent of the 4.9 million hotel rooms in the United States, according hotelnewsnow.com. It cleverly gave itself an edge by designing an iPod alarm clock that would ring only once and then reset itself, preventing the next guest in the room from being unexpectedly awakened at 5:30 in the morning.
Responding to the current obsession with software applications, or apps, for the iPhone or iPad, the company has created its first app-aware alarm clock. Its free iHome+Sleep app allows an iPhone user to customize the phone with sleep, wake and music instructions.
When a traveler docks the iPhone to the hotel alarm clock, the proper settings are used. That way, a weary traveler never has to figure out how the alarm clock works. The app also handles Twitter messages and aggregates news and weather that is displayed on the iPhone upon awakening.
Its first iPad-compatible product, the $199 iA100, will be sold later this year at its usual outlets, including Best Buy and Apple stores. Like all accessories manufacturers, iHome had to wait until the iPad was in stores before it could learn its dimensions and specs.
It reconfigured an earlier, iPhone-only design to accommodate the iPad. The iA100, equipped with Bluetooth, can stream music from an unconnected iPhone or iPad across a room. The iA100's clock also syncs to the correct time on an iPhone or iPad.
Given the iPad's larger battery capacity, Mr. Ashkenazi's designers were not concerned with having it continuously connected to the docking station to be recharged. To appeal to video game players, iHome increased the unit's sound quality by incorporating four speakers and enhanced bass response.
Though Apple's products are selling well, some analysts say SDI Technologies is still taking a risk by relying on one company's products.
''You're tied to the core,'' said Robert Enderle, president of the Enderle Group research firm. ''If the Android smartphone market takes off, you're in trouble.''
Mr. Ashkenazi is not worried. ''The iPad, iPhone and iPod are recession-proof,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Q. and A. With Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
Q: (Reader)
What's the story behind the recent commercial for Era laundry detergent, which mixes the crispness of today's video with the (relatively) grainy footage of messy spills from the brand's campaign upwards of 15 years ago? 
A: (Stuart Elliott)
Era is one of the many fabric care brands sold by Procter & Gamble, and here is a response to your question, dear reader, from Christina Saunders, a spokeswoman for Procter in Cincinnati.
''Era's tough stain-fighting equity remains strong with consumers,'' Ms. Saunders writes in an e-mail, and the premise of the commercial ''continues to be relevant and engaging because it clearly depicts the situations where a hard-working detergent can help.''
''The original copy was updated to communicate Era is now offered at a new lower price keeping true to the brand's overall objective of being tough on stains, but easy on consumers' wallets,'' Ms. Saunders says. The price reduction was made by Procter as part of efforts to keep its name-brand products appealing to consumers as they seek to save money.
The original commercial was created by the Leo Burnett unit of the Publicis Groupe, Ms. Saunders says, and Upstream Media made the updates.
Q: (Reader)
This is in reference to your article about the new Levi's jeans campaign set in Braddock, Pa., and the recent comments from readers about it. As advertising, it sounds like a good plan to focus on real working people in Braddock. But as a corporate citizen, I think Levi Strauss is being hypocritical.
Levi Strauss and its peers in the clothing industry have outsourced or off-shored nearly all of their manufacturing in the last 10 to 20 years. Now that there are towns like Braddock all across the United States -- which used to have strong local economies based on manufacturing, but now have weak economies based on unemployment benefits -- Levi Strauss wants to be seen as saluting the workers.
Many ''American'' brands are all guilty of this. In their rush to improve short-term profits, they have helped kill an entire sector of industry in the United States. Even that ''socialist'' Henry Ford understood that it would be a good idea if his workers could afford to buy his cars.
It is nearly impossible anymore to find clothes made in the United States, but I refuse to buy from these ''flag-waver'' companies that promote themselves as pro-worker when they are just the opposite.
A: (Stuart Elliott)
Thanks, dear reader, for sharing your comments. Levi Strauss and the officials of Braddock say the company is donating more than a million dollars over two years to help the town with projects like renovating a community center. But judging from this comment and others I have received in recent weeks, marketers with campaigns that celebrate the nobility of American workers are going to be held to a very high standard by skeptical consumers.

HEADLINE: Fed Shifting Its Debate To Deflation

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve will meet on Tuesday faced with a pivotal decision about whether to abandon its presumption that the economy is gradually picking up steam and begin to consider new steps to keep the recovery from sputtering out.
A string of developments, including the weak jobs report last Friday, has altered the sentiment within the central bank, leading Fed policy makers to stop worrying for the moment about the increasingly remote prospect of inflation. Instead, they are increasingly focused on the potential for the economy to slip into a deflationary spiral of declining demand, prices and wages. 
Economists, including former Fed officials, say the central bank's interest rate policy committee is likely, at the least, to acknowledge the slowdown in the recovery, and to discuss steps like reinvesting the proceeds from its huge mortgage-bond portfolio, which could help the economy by keeping more money in circulation.
Not since 2003 has the prospect of deflation been taken so seriously at the Fed, and not since the 2008 financial crisis have the markets been looking so closely to it for guidance. With Congress unwilling to embark on substantial new stimulus spending, the Fed has the only tools likely to be employed anytime soon in response to the economic warning signs.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and other officials believe that the Fed, having lowered interest rates all the way to zero in 2008, still has the ability to avoid deflation. But they are also concerned that any new dose of monetary medicine could carry unintended side effects, making it harder to normalize policy in the future.
Complicating matters, a vocal minority of Fed officials is skeptical that deflation -- a spiral of falling wages and prices, which Japan's economy has experienced since the 1990s -- is even a worry.
''The outcome of this meeting is more uncertain than in any in at least the last year,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor.
At the Fed's last meeting, in June, the prospect of deflation was discussed for the first time this year.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman for 18 years until he retired in 2006, said Friday that the economic outlook had darkened. ''It strikes me as a pause in the recovery, but a pause in this type of recovery feels like a quasi-recession,'' he said.
He added: ''At this particular moment, disinflationary pressures are paramount. They will not last indefinitely.''
Mr. Greenspan said there had been ''some evidence of a pickup in inflation'' until the Greek debt crisis took hold in the spring. But the resulting uncertainty drove down long-term interest rates -- the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.82 percent on Friday, the lowest level since April 2009, and barely budged Monday -- in a reflection of what Mr. Greenspan called continuing problems in the financial markets.
Mr. Greenspan declined to make recommendations or predictions for Fed policy, but on Wall Street, there is already talk that the Fed could begin a new round of quantitative easing -- buying financial assets to hold down long-term interest rates and increase the supply of money.
Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist for Goldman Sachs, predicted on Friday that the Fed would begin a new round of asset purchases -- which could include at least $1 trillion worth of Treasury securities -- late this year or early next year. He revised down his forecast for the growth of gross domestic product in 2011 to 1.9 percent from 2.4 percent. He also predicted that unemployment would hit 10 percent in the second quarter of next year.
Among the voting members of the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year, the presidents of the Fed's Boston and St. Louis district banks have warned recently about the threat of deflation, while the Kansas City bank president is known for his view that inflation, the Fed's traditional enemy, remains the greatest threat. But it is Mr. Bernanke who holds the most say over the outcome.
Randall S. Kroszner, a former Fed governor, said the committee was certain to alter its outlook in its statement on Tuesday.
''I think the language will broadly change to acknowledge the moderation in the pace of the recovery,'' he said.
Mr. Kroszner said it seemed increasingly likely that the Fed could announce that it would reinvest the cash it receives as the mortgage bonds it holds mature, rather than letting its balance sheet gradually shrink over time.
In March, the Fed completed its purchase of $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. A decision to reinvest the bond proceeds in other mortgage-related securities, or in Treasuries, would be largely symbolic but carry great weight, as it would signal concern about the economy, and also make clear that an ''exit strategy'' from easy monetary policy was not imminent.
The Fed might also be poised to discuss two other options: lowering the interest rate it pays on the roughly $1 trillion in reserves that banks are keeping at the Fed in excess of what they are required to, and altering the ''extended period'' language it has been using to describe how long short-term interest rates will remain at ''exceptionally low'' levels.
Frederic S. Mishkin, another former Fed governor, said that most recoveries hit speed bumps, and that economic indicators contained considerable statistical ''noise.'' He said the Fed would be prudent not to overreact.
''It's not clear the Fed needs to ease at this point,'' Mr. Mishkin said. ''If the recovery gets back on track they are still going to have to worry about an exit strategy. Quantitative easing is not a trivial matter. The expansion of the balance sheet leads to many complications for the Federal Reserve.''
But Mr. Meyer, the former Fed govenor, said the committee should take into account not just the probability of various outcomes, but the potential damage associated with each of them.
''Because the cost of a slowdown in growth is so dramatic relative to that of higher inflation, they should follow the risk-management strategy that Greenspan espoused during the last deflation scare,'' he said.
During that period, in 2002-3, the Fed kept interest rates low, as the economy recovered from the 2001 recession, to guard against deflation. Those fears did not come to pass. But some now say the Fed kept rates too low for too long, feeding the housing bubble.
''It is by no means a slam dunk,'' Mr. Meyer said of the Fed's decision.

HEADLINE: Economic Pessimists Gain Cachet

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- The central question dividing economists these days is whether Western governments should spend more to ward off a potential second recession or retrench to hold down their ballooning debts to restore confidence among investors.
But Albert Edwards, an investment strategist in London for the French bank Societe Generale, considers the debate a waste of time. To be specific, he forecasts a ''bloody, deep recession'' that produces a stock market collapse of at least 60 percent, followed by years of inflation of 20 percent to 30 percent as the persistent printing of money by central banks desperate to improve the situation sends prices soaring.
Mr. Edwards's sandals and chuckling demeanor belie his reputation as perhaps the City of London's best-known permabear -- a species that has long flourished on the outer margins of the financial industry but rarely inside mainstream banks.
That is no longer true. 
With the shocking financial crisis of 2008 still fresh in people's minds, and gloom-spinning economists like Nouriel Roubini having achieved pop culture status, even longstanding pessimists like Mr. Edwards -- who has been forecasting a Japanese-style stock market slump in the United States since 1997 -- are being treated with newfound respect.
In many smart-money circles, listening to bears has become fashionable, especially now that doubts remain about the sustainability of the euro zone, concerns grow that the United States may slip back into recession and that even the Chinese growth engine may seize up. But to some, the popularization of extremely dire forecasts suggests that the pendulum may have swung too far.
''Nothing is ridiculous anymore,'' said Philippe Jabre, a hedge fund executive in Geneva. ''There is no doubt that these days extremely negative research is being tolerated more.''
Mr. Jabre said that most of the research that came his way had a distinctly negative bias and that finding actionable ideas with a positive spin was becoming far more difficult. ''These guys are reinforcing a conviction among many who invest in hedge funds that they should remain scared,'' he said.
Mr. Edwards's newfound popularity reflects the trend. Once frequently shown the door by disbelieving clients, Mr. Edwards recently drew 600 investors to a conference in London.
Similarly, Bob Janjuah, the one strategist in London whose prognostications are seen by some as even more dire than those of Mr. Edwards -- ''even I get depressed reading his stuff,'' Mr. Edwards remarked -- said he was courted by half a dozen investment banks this summer before deciding to leave his post at Royal Bank of Scotland to join Nomura. (He starts officially in October.)
''Clients are more receptive to hearing polar ends of an investment view,'' said Mr. Janjuah, who expects economic growth for the top developed economies to average little better than 1 percent a year over the next five years.
Further afield, Raoul Pal, a former Goldman Sachsderivatives expert and hedge fund manager, has attracted a growing following with his monthly research note that, most recently, predicted a depression in the United States similar to that of the 1930s and eventual bankruptcy for Britain.
Mr. Pal writes The Global Macro Investor from a holiday village in Valencia. a province in Spain. He said that demand was so great now that he has the luxury of doling out his high-price annual subscriptions only to clients he considers sophisticated enough to pass muster or who come recommended by people he trusts. Others must join a waiting list, Mr. Pal said, although he declined to say how large the group is.
He said that 30 percent of his clientele -- which includes pension and hedge funds, governments and proprietary traders at banks -- consisted of wealthy family offices with assets of more than $200 million.
''They are easily the most bearish of my subscribers because they invest in the longer term,'' he said, ''and in the longer run they see more uncertainty than ever before.''
According to TrimTabs, a funds researcher, hedge funds withdrew $3.5 billion in April and industry consultants say that many funds -- positioned in July for a continuum of bad market news -- were caught by surprise when the market rallied. ''Where is the research telling me how good Intel's earnings were going to be?'' Mr. Jabre said. ''I just have not seen it.''
In fact, if investors had been following the advice of Mr. Edwards or Mr. Pal over the last month as stocks have bounced back, they would have lost money, as both men readily acknowledge. Mr. Edwards has advised investors to be heavily underinvested in all equities, and Mr. Pal is betting against the United States stock market as well as shorting the euro.
Mr. Pal's bad run began when, after becoming bearish in 2007 and reaping the fruits in 2008, he was caught short by the powerful recovery that began in March 2009. To date in his model portfolio, he has lost 96 percent on a short bet of the Indian stock exchange, 68 percent betting against the Chinese H share stock market and 68 percent on the American mutual fund company Franklin Templeton. (Until 2009, he says his model portfolio was up 700 percent.)
In the tradition of the great macro hedge fund investors like George Soros and Julian H. Robertson Jr., Mr. Pal, whose last job was as a portfolio manager at GLG, a hedge fund based in London, likes to pick a theme that may take years to pan out and run with it.
His big bet is that the United States economy is not just about to enter a double-dip recession but that it will be far worse than anything experienced in the lifetime of anyone younger than 70.
He points to a weak rebound in consumer and industrial spending from the 2008 plunge, suggesting that companies and people will remain reluctant to borrow and spend. ''Never before have we entered a recession with 10 percent unemployment,'' he wrote in his August report. ''And if you take into account that on average a recession increases unemployment by 3 to 5 percent, we could see 15 percent unemployment in the U.S. -- that is staggering.''
As for whether central banks can rescue their economies through a fresh round of money injection, both Mr. Pal and Mr. Edwards are skeptical.
They contend that there is no evidence that the huge injections of liquidity already engineered by the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have led to a pickup in demand for loans.
That may be so. But Ed Yardeni, an independent strategist in the United States recognized for his consistently optimistic views, says it would be a mistake to bet against the evidence from strong corporate profits, which he thinks are already driving a global rebound.
''Despite all this negative spin, we have seen one of the best corporate recoveries ever,'' he said. Executives at large companies ''are being fed this same diet of pessimism, but instead of shutting down they are growing their profits and expanding their operations.''

HEADLINE: The Horror Show

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The employment situation in the United States is much worse than even the dismal numbers from last week's jobless report would indicate. The nation is facing a full-blown employment crisis and policy makers are not responding with anything like the sense of urgency that is needed.
The employment data for July, released by the government on Friday, showed that private employers added just 71,000 jobs during the month and that the unemployment rate remained flat at 9.5 percent. But as bad as those numbers were, if you look beyond them you'll see a horror show. 
Government workers were walking the plank from coast to coast. About 143,000 temporary Census workers were let go, and another 48,000 government employees at the budget-strapped state and local levels lost their jobs. But the worst news, with the most ominous long-term implications, was that the reason the unemployment rate was not higher was because 181,000 workers left the labor force.
With many of them beaten down by the worst jobs situation since the Great Depression, they just stopped looking for work. And given the Alice-in-Wonderland way in which we compile our official jobless statistics, they are no longer counted as unemployed.
Charles McMillion, the president and chief economist of MBG Information Services in Washington, is an expert on employment and has been looking closely for years at the issue of labor force participation. ''Over the past three months,'' he said, ''1,155,000 unemployed people dropped out of the active labor force and were not counted as unemployed. Even ignoring population growth, if these unemployed had not dropped out of the labor force, simple arithmetic shows that the official unemployment rate would have risen from 9.9 percent in April to 10.2 percent in July, rather than -- as it has -- fallen to 9.5 percent.''
Because of normal growth in the working-age population, the labor force increases by roughly 150,000 to 200,000 people per month. If those folks were factored in, said Mr. McMillion, ''unemployment now would be even higher than 10.2 percent.''
We are not even beginning to cope with this crisis, which began long before the onset of the so-called Great Recession. The economy is showing absolutely no sign of countering the nation's staggering jobs deficit.
''We have a large number of people who have just given up hope of finding a job,'' said Mr. McMillion. He pointed out that there are record numbers -- ''I mean lights-out record numbers'' -- of long-term unemployed people who are still looking for jobs. Of the 14.6 million men and women officially counted as unemployed, nearly 45 percent have been out of work for six months or longer.
The Times's Michael Luo wrote a moving article last week about the people who have started calling themselves the ''99ers,'' meaning they have been out of work for more than 99 weeks and thus have exhausted the absolute maximum in unemployment benefits. Nearly a million and a half people have been out of work for at least 99 weeks -- and not all of them qualified for jobless benefits.
Said Mr. McMillion: ''When you combine the long-term unemployed with those who are dropping out and those who are working part-time because they can't find anything else, it is just far beyond anything we've seen in the job market since the 1930s.''
They may be thinking about this in Washington, but they sure aren't doing much about it. The politicians' approach to the jobs crisis has been like passing out umbrellas in a hurricane. Millions are suffering and the entire economy is being undermined, and what are they doing? They're appropriating more and more money for warfare while schizophrenically babbling about balancing the budget.
At some point we're going to have to claw our way out of this denial. With 14.6 million people officially jobless, and 5.9 million who have stopped looking but say they want a job, and 8.5 million who are working part time but would like to work full time, you end up with nearly 30 million Americans who cannot find the work they want and desperately need.
We've got more and more people in our working-age population and fewer and fewer jobs to go around. Mr. McMillion tells us that there are now 3.4 million fewer private-sector jobs in the U.S. than there were a decade ago. In the last 10 years, we've seen the worst job creation record since 1928 to 1938.
We're not heading toward the danger zone. We're there. The U.S. will not remain a stable society if this great employment crisis is not addressed head-on -- and soon. You cannot allow joblessness on this scale to fester. It's wrong, and the blowback will be as destructive and intolerable as it is inevitable.

HEADLINE: A Welfare Check and a Voting Card

 BODY:
After years of deliberate neglect, the Justice Department is finally beginning to enforce the federal law requiring states to provide voter registration at welfare and food stamp offices. The effort not only promises to bring hundreds of thousands of hard-to-reach voters into the electorate, but it could also reduce the impact of advocacy organizations whose role in registering voters caused such a furor in 2008. 
The National Voter Registration Act of 1993, better known as the motor-voter law, is well-known for making it possible to register to vote at state motor vehicle offices. However, the law also required states to allow registration at offices that administer food stamps, welfare, Medicaid, disability assistance and child health programs. States were enthusiastic about the motor-vehicle section of the law, and millions of new voters got on the rolls while getting a driver's license. But registration at public assistance offices proved far less popular.
In part, that was because of additional paperwork at those offices, but in many states, Republican officials did not want to provide easy entry to the voting rolls for low-income people whom they considered more likely to vote Democratic. The Bush administration devoted its attention to seeking out tiny examples of voter fraud and purging people from the rolls in swing states. It did little to enforce the motor-voter law despite years of complaints from civic groups and Democratic lawmakers.
In April, however, President Obama's Justice Department sent the states a set of guidelines making it clear that it expected full compliance with the public-assistance office section of the law -- the first time in the 15-year history of the motor-voter law that the Justice Department has explained what kinds of offices are covered and what procedures are to be used. The guidelines make it clear that people applying for benefits must not only be offered the chance to register but must be given help in filling out the forms if they ask. If states do not comply voluntarily, lawsuits are likely to follow.
The administration will undoubtedly be accused of acting in a self-serving political way by making it easier for more Democrats to vote. The effort may have that effect. But it is worth remembering that the recession has brought millions of new people to food stamp and other welfare offices in the last two years, many of whom may not be traditional Democrats. In addition, government offices are much more likely to provide reliable registrations than Acorn or other advocacy groups that were widely accused of fraudulent sign-ups in the last cycle. Welfare offices generally have extensive methods of verifying identities in order to provide benefits, and it is illegal to provide false records there.
But the best reason to applaud the Justice Department's new posture is that it will bring more voters into public life. When advocacy groups sued Ohio and Missouri to force their public assistance offices into complying, huge groups of new voters surged onto the rolls -- more than 100,000 in Ohio, and more than 200,000 in Missouri. Nationwide enforcement by the Justice Department could add millions more. The more people who have access to the ballot, the better the country will be.

HEADLINE: Slumdog Tourism

BYLINE: By KENNEDY ODEDE. 
Kennedy Odede, the executive director of Shining Hope for Communities, a social services organization, is a junior at Wesleyan University.

 BODY:
Nairobi, Kenya
SLUM tourism has a long history -- during the late 1800s, lines of wealthy New Yorkers snaked along the Bowery and through the Lower East Side to see ''how the other half lives.''
But with urban populations in the developing world expanding rapidly, the opportunity and demand to observe poverty firsthand have never been greater. The hot spots are Rio de Janeiro, Mumbai -- thanks to ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' the film that started a thousand tours -- and my home, Kibera, a Nairobi slum that is perhaps the largest in Africa. 
Slum tourism has its advocates, who say it promotes social awareness. And it's good money, which helps the local economy.
But it's not worth it. Slum tourism turns poverty into entertainment, something that can be momentarily experienced and then escaped from. People think they've really ''seen'' something -- and then go back to their lives and leave me, my family and my community right where we were before.
I was 16 when I first saw a slum tour. I was outside my 100-square-foot house washing dishes, looking at the utensils with longing because I hadn't eaten in two days. Suddenly a white woman was taking my picture. I felt like a tiger in a cage. Before I could say anything, she had moved on.
When I was 18, I founded an organization that provides education, health and economic services for Kibera residents. A documentary filmmaker from Greece was interviewing me about my work. As we made our way through the streets, we passed an old man defecating in public. The woman took out her video camera and said to her assistant, ''Oh, look at that.''
For a moment I saw my home through her eyes: feces, rats, starvation, houses so close together that no one can breathe. I realized I didn't want her to see it, didn't want to give her the opportunity to judge my community for its poverty -- a condition that few tourists, no matter how well intentioned, could ever understand.
Other Kibera residents have taken a different path. A former schoolmate of mine started a tourism business. I once saw him take a group into the home of a young woman giving birth. They stood and watched as she screamed. Eventually the group continued on its tour, cameras loaded with images of a woman in pain. What did they learn? And did the woman gain anything from the experience?
To be fair, many foreigners come to the slums wanting to understand poverty, and they leave with what they believe is a better grasp of our desperately poor conditions. The expectation, among the visitors and the tour organizers, is that the experience may lead the tourists to action once they get home.
But it's just as likely that a tour will come to nothing. After all, looking at conditions like those in Kibera is overwhelming, and I imagine many visitors think that merely bearing witness to such poverty is enough.
Nor do the visitors really interact with us. Aside from the occasional comment, there is no dialogue established, no conversation begun. Slum tourism is a one-way street: They get photos; we lose a piece of our dignity.
Slums will not go away because a few dozen Americans or Europeans spent a morning walking around them. There are solutions to our problems -- but they won't come about through tours.

HEADLINE: Fed-Up Flight Attendant Lets Curses Fly, Then Makes Sliding Exit

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN and RAY RIVERA; Reporting was contributed by Cate Doty, Christine Negroni, Tim Stelloh and Matthew L. Wald.

 BODY:
It has been a long time since flight attendant was a glamorous job title. The hours are long. Passengers with feelings of entitlement bump up against new no-frills policies. Babies scream. Security precautions grate but must be enforced. Airlines demand lightning-quick turnarounds, so attendants herd passengers and collect trash with the grim speed of an Indy pit crew. Everyone, it seems, is in a bad mood.
On Monday, on the tarmac at Kennedy International Airport, a JetBlue attendant named Steven Slater decided he had had enough, the authorities said.
After a dispute with a passenger who stood to fetch luggage too soon on a full flight just in from Pittsburgh, Mr. Slater, 38 and a career flight attendant, got on the public-address intercom and let loose a string of invective. 
Then, the authorities said, he pulled the lever that activates the emergency-evacuation chute and slid down, making a dramatic exit not only from the plane but, one imagines, also from his airline career.
On his way out the door, he paused to grab a beer from the beverage cart. Then he ran to the employee parking lot and drove off, the authorities said.
He was arrested at his home in Belle Harbor, Queens, a few miles from the airport, and charged with felony counts of criminal mischief and reckless endangerment.
''When they hit that emergency chute, it drops down quickly within seconds,'' a law enforcement official said. ''If someone was on the ground and it came down without warning, someone could be injured or killed.''
In a statement, JetBlue said it was working with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to investigate the episode. ''At no time was the security or safety of our customers or crew members at risk,'' the company said.
According to his online profiles, Mr. Slater has been the leader of JetBlue's uniform redesign committee and a member of the airline's in-flight values committee. Neighbors in California, where Mr. Slater grew up, said he had recently been caring for his dying mother, a retired flight attendant, and had done the same for his father, a pilot.
The contretemps on Monday unfolded as JetBlue Flight 1052, a regional Embraer 190 jet, landed at Kennedy around noon -- on time -- with 100 passengers aboard and pulled up to the gate, said another law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing.
The official offered the following account:
One passenger stood up to retrieve belongings from the overhead compartment before the crew had given permission. Mr. Slater instructed the person to remain seated. The passenger defied him. Mr. Slater reached the passenger just as the person was pulling down the luggage, which struck Mr. Slater in the head.
Mr. Slater asked for an apology. The passenger instead cursed at him. Mr. Slater got on the plane's public-address system and cursed out the passenger for all to hear. Then, after declaring that 20 years in the airline industry was enough, he blurted out, ''It's been great!'' He activated the inflatable evacuation slide at a service exit and left the world of flight attending behind.
In short order, his gray two-story house on Beach 128th Street in the Rockaways, just off the ocean, was swarmed by detectives and uniformed officers from New York City and the Port Authority. ''It was like there was a hostage in there,'' said Curt Krakowski, who was working on the deck of a house across the street.
Mr. Slater, Mr. Krakowski said, ''had a smile on his face when the cops brought him out, like, 'Yeah, big deal.' '' Mr. Slater was taken to a Port Authority police building at the airport and was expected to be held overnight.
One person familiar with the investigation said JetBlue took more than 20 minutes to notify the Port Authority police, allowing Mr. Slater time to get home. A spokesman for the airline declined to comment when asked about the delay, and a Port Authority spokesman said, ''In matters of criminality, the Port Authority Police Department should be notified immediately.''
The episode is the latest round in what is seen as an increasingly hostile relationship between airlines and passengers.
A few weeks ago, an Air France flight attendant was arrested for stealing the wallets of first-class passengers. Last year, a Canadian singer parodied United Airlines on YouTube in a series of songs about how the airline broke his guitar.
A new study by the International Air Transport Association found an increase in instances of disgruntled passengers and violence on planes, with the chief cause being passengers who refuse to obey safety orders. By the same token, frequent-flier blogs echo with tales of ''flight attendant rage.''
While JetBlue's flight attendants are not unionized, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants, Corey Caldwell, said anxieties were common on planes. ''Anyone who has traveled since Sept. 11 understands that being in the cabin is stressful these days,'' Ms. Caldwell said.
The portrait of Mr. Slater that emerges from interviews with neighbors and friends and from profiles on MySpace, Facebook and LinkedIn shows a man with mixed feelings about his job.
Photographs show him in the mountains of El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico and sitting behind the wheel of a convertible. ''Steven Slater has visited 22 percent of the countries in the world!'' the MySpace page announces.
Yes, and Pittsburgh, too. ''Chances are I am flying 35,000 feet somewhere over the rainbow on my way to some semifabulous JetBlue Airways destination!'' the MySpace page says. ''Truly, some are better than others. But I am enjoying being back in the skies and seeing them all.''
A former roommate, John Rochelle, said Mr. Slater was seldom home. When Mr. Slater was not working, Mr. Rochelle said, he was usually in Thousand Oaks, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb, caring for his sick mother.
A neighbor there, Ron Franz, said Mr. Slater also cared for his father as he was dying from Lou Gehrig's disease. Mr. Franz, 72, was hard-pressed to explain Mr. Slater's actions on Monday. ''It could be the pressure of his mother's illness, because that's not the type of behavior or conduct that Steve exhibits,'' he said. ''He's a very conscientious, responsible individual.''
But a former flight attendant, Janet Bavasso, who lives next door to Mr. Slater in Queens, found nothing mysterious at all.
''Enough is enough -- good for him,'' Ms. Bavasso said. ''If he would have called me, I would have picked him up.''
Readers' Comments: Readers commenting on the City Room blog on Monday offered views both for and against the flight attendant who fled down a plane's chute at Kennedy Airport. Some equated his actions with their own lives. ''Bravo to the flight attendant. While improper, he was able to find an outlet for his anger that was minimally offensive, did not involve violence or reckless endangerment, and let him vent his anger.'' Brian ''Awesome! I believe this guy's about to experience his 15 minutes of fame. Next public appearance: 'Larry King Live.''' Nancy O. ''What happened to the passenger who violated federal aviation law, company policy, and basic everyday rules of decency and common sense?'' John ''I don't blame the flight attendant -- he probably had enough. Low pay, lousy hours, poor treatment. They make the flight attendants do all the dirty work, and the airlines don't back them up.'' Steve from TravelingProfessor.com ''I think the passenger should spend a night in jail and a trial with Judge Judy to explain his actions. Also, be banned for a couple of years on flying on any airline in the U.S. ever again. The flight attendant could have felt threatened and felt it was the only way not to get hurt.'' Lance H. ''The guy pulled the release on an emergency slide that is intended for that use only. He deserves to be in trouble with his company and the authorities, not to mention the fact he was on the tarmac with no clearance from air traffic control and was running around at one of the busiest airports.'' Nope ''What is it with flight attendants these days? Dealing with large volumes of neurotic passengers on a daily basis is bound to set the fuse on fire. They're not supposed to show emotion, remember? He should be fired for showing emotion and flipping out.'' Dack Robinson ''I wish my office had an evacuation slide.'' Jason ''I am having one of these installed in every meeting room. Haven't we all wanted to hit the 'escape' button?'' Stephen ''The unemployment rate just jumped to 9.501 percent.'' Bruceski

HEADLINE: The Latest on Medicare and Social Security

 BODY:
It's the time of year when the trustees of Medicare and Social Security release their annual reports on the programs' financial health. And that means Americans are likely to be bathed in a fog of political rhetoric that makes it hard to sort out fact from fiction. 
Here's the bottom line: The recently passed health care reform bill is promising to have a positive effect on Medicare, assuming Republican opponents don't succeed in killing the reform in court or otherwise undermining its main provisions. Social Security is holding up even in the face of a weak economy. According to the reports, the date of insolvency for Medicare's hospital fund was pushed back, from 2017 to 2029, because of cost-saving measures in health reform. As for Social Security, without any changes, it will be able to pay full benefits until 2037 and partial benefits after that, the same estimate as in last year's report, despite temporary setbacks from the recession.
Of course, neither program is sound for the long run. But the reports show there is time for lawmakers to reform and strengthen both of the programs for the long haul. The real question is whether they will rise to the challenge or continue to view these vital programs as battlegrounds for scoring partisan points.
The trustees stressed that the improvement in Medicare depends on how effectively the new health care reform law is implemented. For instance, the law envisions paying doctors based on quality and efficiency of treatments, rather than on the number of visits or procedures. As that transition occurs, will Congress resist the inevitable outcry?
Future savings also depend on how Congress and the White House react to the Medicare payment advisory board, established under the new law to recommend additional ways to reduce costs. The recommendations take effect unless Congress passes a law to reject them. Will lawmakers be generally supportive of the board or generally antagonistic?
Technically, Social Security is an easier fix. To put the program on a sound footing will require a combination of moderate benefit cuts and tax increases, which could be distributed fairly and phased in over decades.
A lot of attention will be paid to the finding in the Social Security report that payouts will exceed revenues in 2010 and 2011, as high unemployment drives down payroll taxes. That doesn't endanger benefits, because any shortfall can be covered by the trust fund. But some politicians will depict the imbalance as evidence that deep and urgent cuts are needed soon. That is not the case. If anything, public attention to near-term fluctuations should serve as a reminder that by acting to reform the system sooner rather than later, needed reforms can be fair, gradual and modest.
Medicare is a thorny problem; Social Security, by comparison, is a cinch. More worrisome than either is the hyperpartisan atmosphere in Washington.

HEADLINE: Web Plan From Google And Verizon Is Criticized

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER and MIGUEL HELFT; Brian Stelter contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Google and Verizon on Monday introduced a proposal for how Internet service should be regulated -- and were immediately criticized by groups that favor keeping the network as open as possible.
According to the proposal, Internet service providers would not be able to block producers of online content or offer them a paid ''fast lane.'' It says the Federal Communications Commission should have the authority to stop or fine any rule-breakers.
The proposal, however, carves out exceptions for Internet access over cellphone networks, and for potential new services that broadband providers could offer. In a joint blog post, the companies said these could include things like health care monitoring, ''advanced educational services, or new entertainment and gaming options.'' 
The two companies are hoping to influence regulators and lawmakers in the debate over a principle known as net neutrality, which holds that Internet users should have equal access to all types of information online.
This principle is crucial for consumers and for fostering innovation among Internet entrepreneurs, Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, said in a call with reporters. ''The next two people in a garage really do need an open Internet,'' he said.
But some proponents of net neutrality say that by excluding wireless and other online services, Google and Verizon are creating a loophole that could allow carriers to circumvent regulation meant to ensure openness.
The plan ''creates an Internet for the haves and an Internet for the have-nots,'' said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, senior vice president and policy director at the Media Access Project, an advocacy group in Washington and a member, along with Google, of the Open Internet Coalition. ''It may make some services unaffordable for consumers and access to those services unavailable to new start-ups.''
Ivan Seidenberg, chief executive of Verizon, said the proposal excluded cellphone networks because the companies were ''concerned about the imposition of too many rules'' that could slow the growth of the wireless Web.
The proposal also excludes services that broadband providers may create. These services, the companies said, would have to be ''distinguishable from traditional broadband Internet access services and are not designed to circumvent the rules.'' Mr. Seidenberg said that, for example, the Metropolitan Opera might decide to stream its performances in 3-D through such a service because it would otherwise require too much bandwidth.
Mr. Schmidt said Google had no plans to develop these types of online services.
But some expressed fears that this exception could let companies bypass open-access regulations. For example, an online video start-up could create a competitor to YouTube that did not run on the public Internet and would pay for faster connections to viewers. As those types of payments grew, the access companies might have less incentive to invest in Internet capacity, pushing more content providers to these special services and creating alternative networks that look similar to cable TV.
Jason Hirschhorn, a former president of MySpace and a former executive at MTV Networks, said more questions about the proposal needed to be answered, since the exceptions for new services could be interpreted as ''just another way of going against net neutrality.''
''Imagine a world where ABC, Comedy Central, MTV, any of these brands, were on some other network, and then there was this open Internet,'' he said.
Google and Verizon stressed that their plan was not a business deal, but was a policy proposal that both companies intended to follow and that they wanted the Federal Communications Commission to review. The F.C.C., which since June had been convening meetings of Internet companies, carriers and public interest groups to try to come to an agreement on access issues, called off the talks last week after reports that Google and Verizon had come to a private agreement.
One F.C.C. commissioner came out against the proposal. ''Some will claim this announcement moves the discussion forward. That's one of its many problems,'' the commissioner, Michael J. Copps, said in a statement. ''It is time to move a decision forward -- a decision to reassert F.C.C. authority over broadband telecommunications, to guarantee an open Internet now and forever, and to put the interests of consumers in front of the interests of giant corporations.''
Jen Howard, a spokeswoman for the F.C.C., said that it would not immediately comment on the proposal, and that the views of commissioners did not reflect those of Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman.
Mr. Genachowski said last week that ''any deal that doesn't preserve the freedom and openness of the Internet for consumers and entrepreneurs will be unacceptable.''
In a speech at the Brookings Institution late last year, Mr. Genachowski addressed the wireless issue, saying that ''it is essential that the Internet itself remain open, however users reach it.'' But he seemed to show some flexibility on other services.
''I also recognize that there may be benefits to innovation and investment of broadband providers offering managed services in limited circumstances,'' he said, adding that such services ''can supplement -- but must not supplant -- free and open Internet access.''
Rebecca Arbogast, a telecommunications analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, predicted that the F.C.C. would probably demand that any net neutrality rules cover wireless, and that the details of any exceptions for specialized online services be made clear.
Silicon Valley companies seemed wary of the proposal. EBay said it would review the suggestions. Paul Misener, vice president for global public policy at Amazon.com, said that although the company agreed that network operators should be able to offer additional services, ''we are concerned that this proposal appears to condone services that could harm consumer Internet access.''
Groups and companies opposed to open-access regulation also had guarded reactions. AT&T said that it would examine the proposal closely, and that ''the Verizon-Google agreement demonstrates that it is possible to bridge differences on this issue.''
Gregory L. Rosston, a former deputy chief economist at the Federal Communications Commission and deputy director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, said keeping wireless networks free from regulation made sense, because of good competition among wireless providers. ''The more competition you have for broadband access, the less need you have for net-neutrality-type regulation,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Portugal Gives Itself a Clean-Energy Makeover

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
LISBON -- Five years ago, the leaders of this sun-scorched, wind-swept nation made a bet: To reduce Portugal's dependence on imported fossil fuels, they embarked on an array of ambitious renewable energy projects -- primarily harnessing the country's wind and hydropower, but also its sunlight and ocean waves.
Today, Lisbon's trendy bars, Porto's factories and the Algarve's glamorous resorts are powered substantially by clean energy. Nearly 45 percent of the electricity in Portugal's grid will come from renewable sources this year, up from 17 percent just five years ago.
Land-based wind power -- this year deemed ''potentially competitive'' with fossil fuels by the International Energy Agency in Paris -- has expanded sevenfold in that time. And Portugal expects in 2011 to become the first country to inaugurate a national network of charging stations for electric cars. 
''I've seen all the smiles -- you know: It's a good dream. It can't compete. It's too expensive,'' said Prime Minister Jose Socrates, recalling the way Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, mockingly offered to build him an electric Ferrari. Mr. Socrates added, ''The experience of Portugal shows that it is possible to make these changes in a very short time.''
The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has renewed questions about the risks and unpredictable costs of America's unremitting dependence on fossil fuels. President Obama has seized on the opportunity to promote his goal of having 20 to 25 percent of America's electricity produced from renewable sources by 2025.
While Portugal's experience shows that rapid progress is achievable, it also highlights the price of such a transition. Portuguese households have long paid about twice what Americans pay for electricity, and prices have risen 15 percent in the last five years, probably partly because of the renewable energy program, the International Energy Agency says.
Although a 2009 report by the agency called Portugal's renewable energy transition a ''remarkable success,'' it added, ''It is not fully clear that their costs, both financial and economic, as well as their impact on final consumer energy prices, are well understood and appreciated.''
Indeed, complaints about rising electricity rates are a mainstay of pensioners' gossip here. Mr. Socrates, who after a landslide victory in 2005 pushed through the major elements of the energy makeover over the objections of the country's fossil fuel industry, survived last year's election only as the leader of a weak coalition.
''You cannot imagine the pressure we suffered that first year,'' said Manuel Pinho, Portugal's minister of economy and innovation from 2005 until last year, who largely masterminded the transition, adding, ''Politicians must take tough decisions.''
Still, aggressive national policies to accelerate renewable energy use are succeeding in Portugal and some other countries, according to a recent report by IHS Emerging Energy Research of Cambridge, Mass., a leading energy consulting firm. By 2025, the report projected, Ireland, Denmark and Britain will also get 40 percent or more of their electricity from renewable sources; if power from large-scale hydroelectric dams, an older type of renewable energy, is included, countries like Canada and Brazil join the list.
The United States, which last year generated less than 5 percent of its power from newer forms of renewable energy, will lag behind at 16 percent (or just over 20 percent, including hydroelectric power), according to IHS.
To force Portugal's energy transition, Mr. Socrates's government restructured and privatized former state energy utilities to create a grid better suited to renewable power sources. To lure private companies into Portugal's new market, the government gave them contracts locking in a stable price for 15 years -- a subsidy that varied by technology and was initially high but decreased with each new contract round.
Compared with the United States, European countries have powerful incentives to pursue renewable energy. Many, like Portugal, have little fossil fuel of their own, and the European Union's emissions trading system discourages fossil fuel use by requiring industry to essentially pay for excessive carbon dioxide emissions.
Portugal was well poised to be a guinea pig because it has large untapped resources of wind and river power, the two most cost-effective renewable sources. Government officials say the energy transformation required no increase in taxes or public debt, precisely because the new sources of electricity, which require no fuel and produce no emissions, replaced electricity previously produced by buying and burning imported natural gas, coal and oil. By 2014 the renewable energy program will allow Portugal to fully close at least two conventional power plants and reduce the operation of others.
''So far the program has placed no stress on the national budget'' and has not created government debt, said Shinji Fujino, head of the International Energy Agency's country study division.
If the United States is to catch up to countries like Portugal, energy experts say, it must overcome obstacles like a fragmented, outdated energy grid poorly suited to renewable energy; a historic reliance on plentiful and cheap supplies of fossil fuels, especially coal; powerful oil and coal industries that often oppose incentives for renewable development; and energy policy that is heavily influenced by individual states.
The relative costs of an energy transition would inevitably be higher in the United States than in Portugal. But as the expense of renewable power drops, an increasing number of countries see such a shift as worthwhile, said Alex Klein, research director, clean and renewable power generation, at IHS.
''The cost gap will close in the next decade, but what you get right away is an energy supply that is domestically controlled and safer,'' Mr. Klein said.
Necessity Drives Change
Portugal's venture was driven by necessity. With a rising standard of living and no fossil fuel of its own, the cost of energy imports -- principally oil and gas -- doubled in the last decade, accounting for 50 percent of the country's trade deficit, and was highly volatile. The oil went to fuel cars, the gas mainly to electricity. Unlike the United States, Portugal never depended heavily on coal for electricity generation because close and reliable sources of natural gas were available in North Africa, and Europe's carbon trading system could make coal costly.
Portugal is now on track to reach its goal of using domestically produced renewable energy, including large-scale hydropower, for 60 percent of its electricity and 31 percent of its total energy needs by 2020. (Total energy needs include purposes other than generating electricity, like heating homes and powering cars.)
In making the shift, Portugal has overcome longstanding concerns about reliability and high cost. The lights go on in Lisbon even when the wind dies down at the vast two-year-old Alto Minho wind farm. The country's electricity production costs and consumer electricity rates -- including the premium prices paid for power from renewable sources -- are about average for Europe, but still higher than those in China or the United States, countries that rely on cheap coal.
Portugal says it has kept costs down by focusing heavily on the cheapest forms of renewable energy -- wind and hydropower -- and ratcheting down the premium prices it pays to lure companies to build new plants.
While the government estimates that the total investment in revamping Portugal's energy structure will be about 16.3 billion euros, or $22 billion, that cost is borne by the private companies that operate the grid and the renewable plants and is reflected in consumers' electricity rates. The companies' payback comes from the 15 years of guaranteed wholesale electricity rates promised by the government. Once the new infrastructure is completed, Mr. Pinho said, the system will cost about 1.7 billion euros ($2.3 billion) a year less to run than it formerly did, primarily by avoiding natural gas imports.
A smaller savings will come from carbon credits Portugal can sell under the European Union's carbon trading system: countries and industries that produce fewer emissions than allotted can sell permits to those that exceed their limits.
Mr. Fujino of the International Energy Agency said Portugal's calculations might be optimistic. But he noted that the country's transition had also created a valuable new industry: Last year, for the first time, it became a net power exporter, sending a small amount of electricity to Spain. Tens of thousands of Portuguese work in the field. Energias de Portugal, the country's largest energy company, owns wind farms in Iowa and Texas, through its American subsidiary, Horizon Wind Energy.
Redesigning the System
A nationwide supply of renewable power requires a grid that can move electricity from windy, sunny places to the cities.
But a decade ago in Portugal, as in many places in the United States today, power companies owned not only power generating plants, but also transmission lines. Those companies have little incentive to welcome new sources of renewable energy, which compete with their investment in fossil fuels. So in 2000, Portugal's first step was to separate making electricity from transporting it, through a mandatory purchase by the government of all transmission lines for electricity and gas at what were deemed fair market prices.
Those lines were then used to create the skeleton of what since 2007 has been a regulated and publicly traded company that operates the national electricity and natural gas networks.
Next, the government auctioned off contracts to private companies to build and operate wind and hydropower plants. Bidders were granted rights based on the government-guaranteed price they would accept for the energy they produced, as well as on their willingness to invest in Portugal's renewable economy, including jobs and other venture capital funds. Some of the winners were foreign companies. In the latest round of bidding, the price guaranteed for wind energy was in the range of the price paid for electricity generated by natural gas.
Such a drastic reorganization might be extremely difficult in the United States, where power companies have strong political sway and states decide whether to promote renewable energy. Colorado recently legislated that 30 percent of its energy must come from renewable sources by 2020, but neighboring Utah has only weak voluntary goals. Coal states, like Kentucky and West Virginia, have relatively few policies to encourage alternative energies.
In Portugal, said Mr. Pinho, the former economy minister, who will join Columbia University's faculty, ''the prime minister had an absolute majority.''
''He was very strong, and everyone knew we would not step back,'' Mr. Pinho said.
A Flexible Network
Running a country using electricity derived from nature's highly unpredictable forces requires new technology and the juggling skills of a plate spinner. A wind farm that produces 200 megawatts one hour may produce only 5 megawatts a few hours later; the sun shines intermittently in many places; hydropower is plentiful in the rainy winter, but may be limited in summer.
Portugal's national energy transmission company, Redes Energeticas Nacionais or R.E.N., uses sophisticated modeling to predict weather, especially wind patterns, and computer programs to calculate energy from the various renewable-energy plants. Since the country's energy transition, the network has doubled the number of dispatchers who route energy to where it is needed.
''You need a lot of new skills. It's a real-time operation, and there are far more decisions to be made -- every hour, every second,'' said Victor Baptista, director general of R.E.N. ''The objective is to keep the system alive and avoid blackouts.''
Like some American states, Portugal has for decades generated electricity from hydropower plants on its raging rivers. But new programs combine wind and water: Wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night, the most blustery period; then the water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest.
Denmark, another country that relies heavily on wind power, frequently imports electricity from its energy-rich neighbor Norway when the wind dies down; by comparison, Portugal's grid is relatively isolated, although R.E.N. has greatly increased its connection with Spain to allow for energy sharing.
Portugal's distribution system is also now a two-way street. Instead of just delivering electricity, it draws electricity from even the smallest generators, like rooftop solar panels. The government aggressively encourages such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity. ''To make this kind of system work, you have to make a lot of different kinds of deals at the same time,'' said Carlos Zorrinho, the secretary of state for energy and innovation.
To ensure a stable power base when the forces of nature shut down, the system needs to maintain a base of fossil fuel that can be fired up at will. Although Portugal's traditional power plants now operate many fewer hours than before, the country is also building some highly efficient natural gas plants.
To accommodate all this, Portugal needed new transmission lines from remote windy regions to urban centers. Portugal began modernizing its grid a decade ago. Accommodating a greater share of renewable power cost an additional 480 million euros, or about $637 million, an expense folded into electricity rates, according to R.E.N.
Last year, President Obama offered billions of dollars in grants to modernize the grid in the United States, but it is not clear that such a piecemeal effort will be adequate for renewable power. Widely diverse permitting procedures in different states and the fact that many private companies control local fragments of the grid make it hard to move power over long distances, for example, from windy Iowa to users in Atlanta. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the United States' grid a ''D+,'' commenting that it is ''in urgent need of modernization.''
''A real smart national grid would radically change our technology profile,'' said John Juech, vice president for policy analysis at Garten Rothkopf, a Washington consulting firm that focuses on energy. ''But it will be very costly, and the political will may not be there.''
A 2009 report commissioned by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change estimated that the United States would have to spend $3 billion to $4 billion a year for the next two decades to create a grid that could accommodate deriving 20 percent of electricity from wind power by 2030 -- a 40 percent to 50 percent increase over current spending.
The Drawbacks
Energy experts consider Portugal's experiment a success. But there have been losers. Many environmentalists object to the government plans to double the amount of wind energy, saying lights and noise from turbines will interfere with birds' behavior. Conservation groups worry that new dams will destroy Portugal's cork-oak habitats.
Local companies complain that the government allowed large multinationals to displace them.
Until it became the site of the largest wind farm south of Lisbon, Barao de Sao Joao was a sleepy village on the blustery Alentejo Coast, home to farmers who tilled its roller coaster hills and holiday homeowners drawn to cheap land and idyllic views. Renewable energy has brought conflict.
''I know it's good for the country because it's clean energy and it's good for the landowners who got money, but it hasn't brought me any good,'' said Jose Cristino, 48, a burly farmer harvesting grain with a wind turbine's thrap-thrap-thrap in the background. ''I look at these things day and night.'' He said 90 percent of the town's population had been opposed.
In Portugal, as in the United States, politicians have sold green energy programs to communities with promises of job creation. Locally, the effect has often proved limited. For example, more than five years ago, the isolated city of Moura became the site of Portugal's largest solar plant because it ''gets the most sun of anywhere in Europe and has lots of useless space,'' said Jose Maria Prazeres Pos-de-Mina, the mayor.
But while 400 people built the Moura plant, only 20 to 25 work there now, since gathering sunlight requires little human labor. Unemployment remains at 15 percent, the mayor said -- though researchers, engineers and foreign delegations frequently visit the town's new solar research center.
Indeed, Portugal's engineers and companies are now global players. Portugal's EDP Renovaveis, first listed on stock exchanges in 2008, is the third largest company in the world in wind-generated electricity output. This year, its Portuguese chief executive, Ana Maria Fernandes, signed contracts to sell electricity from its wind farm in Iowa to the Tennessee Valley Authority.
''Broadly, Europe has had great success in this area,'' said Mr. Juech, the analyst at Garten Rothkopf. ''But that is the result of huge government support and intervention, and that raises questions about what happens when you have an economic crisis or political change; will these technologies still be sustainable?''

HEADLINE: Pentagon Plans Steps to Reduce Budget and Jobs

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Monday that he would close a military command, restrict the use of outside contractors and reduce the number of generals and admirals across the armed forces as part of a broad effort to rein in Pentagon spending.
Mr. Gates did not place a dollar figure on the total savings from the cutbacks, some of which are likely to be challenged by members of Congress intent on retaining jobs in their states and districts. But they appear to be Mr. Gates's most concrete proposals to cut current spending as he tries to fend off calls from many Democrats for even deeper budget reductions, and they reflect his strategy of first trying to squeeze money out of the vast Pentagon bureaucracy. 
While large headquarters have been combined and realigned over the years, Pentagon officials could not recall a time when a major command was shut down and vanished off the books, even though some jobs will probably be added elsewhere to carry on essential parts of the mission.
The White House, which is under intense political pressure to address the rapid increase in the national debt, quickly stepped in to back Mr. Gates, saying his plan would free money that could be better spent on war fighting.
''The funds saved will help us sustain the current force structure and make needed investments in modernization in a fiscally responsible way,'' President Obama said in a statement.
The potential savings Mr. Gates outlined are likely to be relatively modest in the context of a total Pentagon budget, including war fighting costs, projected to top $700 billion next year. The most significant step -- in symbol and in substance -- was his plan to close the military's Joint Forces Command in Norfolk, Va.
The command includes about 2,800 military and civilian positions supported by 3,000 contractors at an annual cost of $240 million. Its responsibilities, which include managing the allocation of global forces and running programs to press the armed services to work together on the battlefield, will be reassigned, mostly to personnel working under the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon.
Mr. Gates also called for a 10 percent annual reduction in spending on contractors who provide support services to the military, including money for intelligence-related contracts, and he placed a freeze on the number of workers in the office of the secretary of defense, other Pentagon supervisory agencies and the headquarters of the military's combat commands.
And he went after one of the military's most sacrosanct personnel structures, placing a cap on the number of generals, admirals and senior civilian positions.
Beyond that immediate freeze, the Defense Department will move to cut at least 50 general and admiral posts and 150 senior civilian positions over the next two years. There are now just under 1,000 general and flag officers, a growth of more than 100 since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
For months, Mr. Gates has been arguing that if Congress and the public allow the Pentagon budget to grow by 1 percent a year, he can find 2 percent or 3 percent in savings within the department's bureaucracy to reinvest in the military -- and that will be sufficient to meet long-term national security needs.
''Our country is still fighting two wars, confronts ongoing terrorist threats around the globe, and faces other major powers investing heavily in their military,'' Mr. Gates said Monday. ''It is important that we not repeat the mistakes of the past, where tough economic times or the winding down of a military campaign leads to steep and unwise reductions in defense.''
But members of Congress tend to fight to protect jobs and spending in their districts, and some of the proposed cuts -- in particular eliminating the Joint Forces Command -- are certain to earn strong opposition.
Just minutes after Mr. Gates announced his initiatives at a Pentagon news conference, Senator Jim Webb, a Virginia Democrat who is on the Armed Services Committee, released a statement vowing to ''carefully examine the justifications for this decision as well as its implications for the greater Norfolk community.''
Representative Ike Skelton, the Missouri Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the proposals ''appear to efficiently find savings within the defense budget without taking away resources from our war fighters.''
But the ranking Republican on the committee, Representative Howard P. McKeon of California, said, he was unconvinced ''that these savings will be reinvested into America's defense requirements and not harvested by Congressional Democrats for new domestic spending and entitlement programs.''
Assessing his prospects for convincing Congress not to use its power over budgets to block these efforts, Mr. Gates said, ''Hard is not impossible.''
Two other Defense Department agencies will also be closed, with their functions eliminated or reassigned. They are the office of the assistant secretary of defense for networks and information integration, with 200 employees, and the Business Transformation Agency, with 350 people.
Pentagon spending has averaged a growth rate of 7 percent a year over the last decade, adjusted for inflation (or nearly 12 percent a year without adjusting), including the costs of the wars. Mr. Obama has asked Congress for an increase in total spending next year of 2.2 percent, to $708 billion -- 6.1 percent higher than the peak in the Bush administration.
Mr. Gates bemoaned that ''this department is awash in taskings for reports and studies,'' and he ordered a freeze on the number of such internal assessments. For those that remain and others ordered by Congress, the Pentagon will publish the cost of preparation in each document.
Mr. Gates has already canceled or trimmed several dozen weapons programs, with long-term savings, based on projections of what the programs would have cost, predicted at $330 billion.
Mr. Gates has ordered the armed services and the Pentagon's agencies to find $100 billion in spending cuts and efficiencies over the next five years: $7 billion for 2012, growing to $37 billion annually by 2016.
Mr. Gates was asked at the end of his briefing what would happen to Gen. Ray Odierno, who is ending a command tour in Iraq to take over the Joint Forces Command, now slated to be closed.
''I've told Ray that his assignment at JFCOM is essentially the same as his assignment in Iraq, and that is to work himself out of a job,'' Mr. Gates said. ''And then I'll find a new and better one for him.''

HEADLINE: For G.M., A Subprime Solution

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
There goes the General Motors pre-I.P.O. roadshow.
President Obama visited Detroit last week and declared: ''We expect taxpayers will get back all the money my administration has invested in G.M.''
The president's comment came the same day that G.M.'s chief executive, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., avowed, ''We don't want to be known as Government Motors,'' and told an industry conference, ''If you liked our first-quarter financial results, stay tuned for our second-quarter financial results.'' 
All this shilling has a subtext: General Motors is planning to file documents soon with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pursue an initial public offering this year. It has hardly been a secret, with Mr. Whitacre's mentioning the prospect of an I.P.O. at nearly every turn.
That helps explain the timing of General Motors' biggest deal since it emerged from bankruptcy in July 2009. Two weeks ago, the company agreed to buy AmeriCredit, a subprime lender, for $3.5 billion. At the time, industry insiders whispered, not so quietly, that it was meant to dress up G.M.'s sales numbers before an I.P.O.
Last week, Mr. Whitacre appeared to acknowledge as much. ''It strengthens the I.P.O. because it shows we have a credit organization just like Ford and Toyota,'' he told The Detroit News, suggesting that AmeriCredit would substantially increase vehicle sales. Indeed, analysts have estimated that AmeriCredit could increase G.M. sales by 10 to 20 percent a year.
In other words -- and take a moment to think about what this means -- G.M. plans to prod sales of its vehicles by using AmeriCredit to extend loans and leases to automobile customers with questionable credit. (That's why they are called subprime loans.) These are the same customers who could very well be denied a loan by other lenders. But prudent lending is not at the top of G.M.'s to-do list: it needs to move its vehicles off the lot and it needs to do so quickly.
As Mr. Whitacre bluntly put it, ''When you own somebody, you can tell them what to do.''
When General Motors last owned a financing arm, GMAC Financial Services, it was its mortgage business, Residential Capital or ResCap, that got into trouble, not its auto loans. In 2007, G.M. sold off 51 percent of GMAC, which ultimately required a $17.2 billion bailout as the housing market imploded.
Still, General Motors arguably exploited GMAC, using it to make some bad loans so it could increase car sales to what now look like unsustainable levels. (The company, by the way, held talks to repurchase GMAC, now Ally Financial, but instead chose to buy AmeriCredit.)
So here we go again, three years later, and G.M. is buying a subprime company to finance cars for people who may not be able to afford them, and given high unemployment levels, may not even have jobs to start saving for one. And yes, we, the taxpayers, still own 61 percent of the automaker.
''After G.M.'s experience with GMAC, which left G.M. seeking a taxpayer bailout, you have to think the company and, in turn, the taxpayers would be better off if G.M. focused on making cars that people want to buy and stayed clear of repeating its effort to make high-risk car loans,'' Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican, said in a statement.
Mr. Grassley has called on the special inspector general for Troubled Asset Relief Program to investigate the deal.
In fairness, there are people who deserve automobile loans but can't get them for a variety of reasons. Companies like AmeriCredit can play an important role in helping get credit to those people. And AmeriCredit, which is not considered a predatory lender, has a much better record of responsible lending; it was one of the few companies in the industry not to seek help through the relief program.
In truth, subprime auto lending is not nearly as dangerous as subprime mortgage lending. ''Auto loans are a depreciating asset, while housing had historically been an appreciating asset,'' Daniel Indiviglio of The Atlantic recently wrote. '' So when an auto lender models defaults, it assumes that the car will be worth less at resale than it was at purchase. Thus, even in a deep recession, credit losses won't be as devastating if conservative stress scenarios were considered.''
But why not form a tighter alliance with AmeriCredit rather than buy it in its entirety?
The question answers itself: an alliance would never give G.M. enough control over the lender to loosen its credit standards.
Surely, it will be difficult for AmeriCredit to remain as conservative as it has been when G.M. needs to sell vehicles. The unit will come under enormous pressure for another reason: the bulk of its current automotive lending is not for G.M. vehicles. AmeriCredit serves 11,000 dealerships, but only 4,000 are related to G.M. With the acquisition, rival automobile makers may reduce their business with AmeriCredit, forcing it to depend even more on selling G.M. vehicles.
G.M. did not respond to requests for comment.
As taxpayers and investors in G.M., we should all be rooting for a successful stock sale -- the company would like the government's entire 61 percent stake to be in the hands of shareholders -- so that we can get back at least some of the money we invested.
Yet while taxpayers still have a stake and a voice in G.M., there are some serious public policy questions that should be raised about the idea of a government-owned enterprise getting into a questionable loan business.
The deal may be a great short-term decision to help a General Motors I.P.O. -- it may even be a good long-term strategy. But did we really spend $50 billion of our money just to revive the kinds of practices that led to the credit crisis?

HEADLINE: Committed to Family, Dedicated to Basketball

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

 BODY:
The bruises come with Taj McWilliams-Franklin's territory in the low post. More painful are the wounds opened by e-mails like the one from her husband saying a kindergarten classmate had punched their daughter in the nose and threatened to kill her.
That happened last year in San Antonio while McWilliams-Franklin, a 6-foot-2 power forward for the Liberty, was playing in Turkey. The news tugged at her heart, which beats for basketball but belongs to her three daughters, two of whom were born when she was an unwed teenager just starting to blossom as a basketball player.
McWilliams-Franklin's 17-year professional career is a triumph of motherhood over matter. She was 33, married and established in the W.N.B.A. when her youngest, Maia, was born in 2003. Maia has a much more stable family life than McWilliams-Franklin could provide for her older children. Michele Taylor-McWilliams was born in September 1988 when her mother was a 17-year-old high school senior in Augusta, Ga.
Michele and her mother were inseparable because there was no money for day care or a baby sitter. While McWilliams-Franklin, now 39 and the oldest player in the W.N.B.A., travels the world for basketball, Maia is cared for by her husband, Reggie Franklin. 
The couple met in Italy, where she was playing and he was stationed as an Army sergeant. Franklin has since retired from the military and is, in McWilliam-Franklin's absence, Maia's primary caregiver, a plan that Susan Newman, a social psychologist, applauds.
''The ideal arrangement if you have to leave your young child is to leave it with a relative,'' Newman said in a telephone interview, ''because you know they have that child's best interests at heart possibly more than anyone else.''
It did not seem close to ideal being 6,000 miles away when Maia was bullied. McWilliams-Franklin's instinct was to hop on the next plane home, but her sense of obligation to her team in Istanbul won out.
''I signed a contract, and once I give my word, I stick to it,'' she said.
She reminded herself that her husband was perfectly capable of handling the situation. That assuaged her guilt, but only a little.
''I cried quite a bit,'' she said, adding: ''It's a Catch-22. Women love their careers and they love their families. Sad as it is, you have to give up something of one or the other in order to be good at one.''
Eleven mothers play in the 12-team W.N.B.A., which has had to cope with players' pregnancies from the beginning. Sheryl Swoopes had her first child in 1997, the league's first year. Candace Parker, the face of the league now as Swoopes was then, missed the start of last season after giving birth.
Parker's sponsors, which include Adidas, stuck with her throughout her pregnancy. But McWilliams-Franklin said she lost endorsements when she sat out the second half of the 2002 season with the Orlando Miracle after learning she was pregnant.
She broke the news about the pregnancy to Franklin and Michele, who was 13 at the time, over the phone. They were in Italy, where Franklin was working.
The one constant in McWilliams-Franklin's nomadic career has been the people who enter her life and ease her load. One of them is Tangela Montgomery, a friend from Texas, who volunteered to watch Michele when McWilliams signed her first overseas contract and eventually became a nanny for Michele and Maia.
A support network is essential. Unlike the L.P.G.A., which offers free on-site child care at its domestic events, the W.N.B.A. has no such perk.
''I think it's easier overseas because the teams are more accommodating,'' said McWilliams-Franklin, who negotiated contract clauses that obligated the team to pay for Michele and a nanny to travel with her. Such contracts are hard to pass up; they often pay at least twice the maximum W.N.B.A. salary of $101,500.
After playing for Frisco Sika Brno in the Czech Republic, McWilliams-Franklin arrived in New York by herself this spring. She eschewed a Liberty-issued apartment for a larger one in White Plains that was near restaurants and shops for when her family visited.
Early in the season, over a vegan meal at a Chinese restaurant within walking distance of her apartment, she said that every time she turned the key, she braced herself for the empty rooms that greeted her. After dinner, she settled in at the restaurant bar to watch an N.B.A. playoff game, drawn there not by the cocktails but by the flow of conversation.
In late June, Franklin and Maia joined her in New York, but she promptly left for 10 days on the Liberty's longest trip of the season. While the team played in Los Angeles, Phoenix and Seattle, Franklin took Maia to the zoo, a water park, museums and a mall, where Maia made a stuffed bear named Brownie.
Two days into the trip, McWilliams-Franklin was dining at an outdoor cafe in downtown Phoenix when a mother and daughter walked past, the girl touching every railing the way Maia does. Engulfed by a wave of loneliness, McWilliams-Franklin phoned home and listened contentedly as Maia breathlessly described Brownie.
''I get a tinge of sadness when I'm away from her now,'' McWilliams-Franklin said. ''But what am I going to do? I can't say: 'I'm having a bad day. I miss Maia.' I can't come every day and say, 'I miss my husband and daughter.' I'm genuinely happy to be able to take care of my family in this economy.''
She could not have imagined such stability when she was pregnant with Michele and estranged from her own father, with whom she lived after her parents divorced.
''I had coaches tell me: 'Don't have this baby. It'll mess up your career,' '' McWilliams-Franklin said.
She added: ''I knew I had to do right by this child and take care of her no matter how bad I felt. It pushed me in the other direction.''
Michele's father was an infrequent presence in their lives, said McWilliams-Franklin, who accepted a scholarship to Georgia State and took Michele to classes and practices.
As a single mother, she could barely support one child. So when McWilliams-Franklin became pregnant again as a college freshman, she moved to Austin, Tex., where her mother lived. She delivered the baby, a girl whom she gave up for adoption.
''It's never an easy decision, especially at the age I was,'' McWilliams-Franklin said. ''As a true mom, you do things that are for the best for your kid, and I knew at the time, there was too much struggling going on. I wanted a better life for her.''
McWilliams-Franklin reconnected with her middle daughter, Schera Sampson, when she was in high school. She sees Sampson, now 20 and a basketball player at Stephen F. Austin State University in Texas, and she knows she made the right decision.
''It turned out well, thank goodness,'' she said.
After her second pregnancy, McWilliams-Franklin received a basketball scholarship to St. Edward's University in Austin. She was a two-time all-American there before playing professionally in Germany, Luxembourg and Israel, with Michele in tow.
They were a two-person kayak paddling through all kinds of storms: the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, in 1995, when McWilliams-Franklin was playing in Galilee, and the 1998 disbanding of the American Basketball League when she played for its Philadelphia franchise.
Michele's father also mounted a custody challenge, questioning McWilliams-Franklin's fitness as a mother while she was playing overseas. He won custody but relinquished his parental rights after a month, McWilliams-Franklin said.
As more mothers take jobs that require travel, the question that has hounded McWilliams-Franklin throughout her career is haunting others: can you be there for your children when you are always on the run?
One positive of such an arrangement, said Newman, the social psychologist, is that ''as your child gets older, you are role-modeling your passion for what you do, you are role-modeling that a career doesn't mean you're always behind a desk, you're role-modeling an independent life.''
If Michele, now a 21-year-old college student in Texas, has scars from her nomadic childhood, she does not seem to pick at them.
''I honestly don't remember a lot,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''Just bits and pieces.''
She does recall resenting the game in which her mother excelled.
''Ever since I was a baby, playing basketball means she's not going to be around,'' she said. ''And I thought maybe if she was doing something else, we'd be together.''
She added: ''It was a little bit of an unstable life because we were moving all the time, but I wouldn't change it for anything. I'm glad I got a chance to go along on the ride with her. It kind of made us closer.''
On a recent afternoon in McWilliams-Franklin's 32nd-floor apartment in White Plains, sunlight poured through the large windows and played off the white walls, but it was no match for McWilliams-Franklin's smile. In the company of Franklin and Maia, she lit up the room.

HEADLINE: New Wave of Iranians Seek U.S. Studies

BYLINE: By YEGANEH JUNE TORBATI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even as a teenager in Iran, Atefeh Fathi knew she would eventually study abroad. Now 30 and studying engineering at the University of Oklahoma, Ms. Fathi said that although she had applied to universities in Sweden and Canada, her first choice was the United States.
''Everyone says the U.S. is easier for foreigners'' to acclimate to, she said while on a break from working in her university's laboratory. As children, Iranians are taught English in school, making it easier for them to blend in immediately in the United States. 
Ms. Fathi is part of a wave of Iranians studying in the United States in numbers not seen in more than a decade. Since 1979, when tens of thousands of Iranians studied in the United States, the number of Iranian students in the United States has taken an almost uninterrupted nosedive, bottoming out at fewer than 1,700 students in 1999. Since then, the number of students has begun a slow but steady rise, with more Iranians in the country now than at any other point since 1994, says the Institute of International Education in New York.
Iranian students said they chose to come to the United States because of its superior schools and generous research financing. These students believe that despite rising political tensions between the United States and Iran, their American educations will put them in line for the best jobs when the return home.
''In specific areas like engineering, the best schools in the whole world are in the U.S.,'' said Naemeh Esfahani, a 29-year-old studying industrial engineering at the University of Southern California. ''If you're a good student, there is no reason wasting your time being in other schools.''
But just to get to the United States ambitious students face obstacles ranging from the inconvenient to the daunting, testing the mettle of even the most steadfast. Student visas can take many months to obtain. Because of security concerns, Iranians face background checks that the State Department refers to as additional administrative processing by the American authorities.
Because there is no American Embassy in Iran, students must travel to American embassies or consulates in other countries to apply. Ms. Fathi submitted her visa application in Cyprus, which she estimates cost her $5,000 in travel and other expenses.
''You know, they just receive an application,'' Ms. Fathi said of college admissions officers. ''They don't know what we have been through to send them that application.''
Once she was finally approved, Ms. Fathi received a visa that allowed her to enter the United States only once, meaning she could not leave the country to return home or to travel abroad without beginning the process all over again. A State Department official said the policy, one of the strictest, reflects Iran's own restrictions on Americans entering the country -- it can be difficult for Americans to obtain visas to enter Iran unless they are part of a chaperoned tour group or related to an Iranian citizen.
If they exit the United States, Iranians can reapply for a visa, but they risk delays or not being approved at all.
''Once you're in, you're stuck here,'' said Maryam Ghiassi-Nejad, 23, an undergraduate at Yale. ''You can't go anywhere for conferences. That opportunity is out the window. If I want to do a summer abroad, that's not an option for me.''
Ms. Ghiassi-Nejad arrived in the United States in 2007, and plans to pursue a medical degree here. If she finishes in 2016, as she plans, she will have spent nine years in the United States without ever leaving its borders.
The complications extend to daily life as well. Parents who want to send their children money cannot do so through bank transfers, a situation exacerbated by tougher American sanctions on Iran. Parents arrange creative solutions, like using a broker. Parents pay the broker in Iran the desired amount plus a fee, and the broker's family member in the United States pays the student. But the arrangement can involve hefty fees and is of dubious legality.
In spite of the restrictions, Omid Memarian, an Iranian journalist and human rights activist who graduated last year from the University of California, Berkeley, attributes the increase in students coming to the United States to the political crackdown in Iran that started when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took office in 2005. Students who demonstrate or speak out against the government, Mr. Memarian said, are often blacklisted from universities, forcing them to go abroad in greater numbers.
Still, he added, young Iranians see a degree from a Western university as the ticket to a well-paying position in an Iranian economy hobbled by sanctions.
Students said they expected to face suspicions upon their return to Iran for spending time in the United States. The government discourages its top students from studying in Europe and the United States, pushing them toward China, Russia and Malaysia instead. But just as they are determined to overcome American restrictions, Iranian students disregard their government's wishes, relying on advice from fellow students in Iran and those who have made it to the United States.
''The United States, especially, is really, really attractive for Iranian students,'' Amin Shariatzadeh, 32, an Iranian student in Oklahoma, said, adding, ''They want to experience America as it is, not through government propaganda.''
Ali Kamranzadeh, an engineering student at the University of Southern California, said students passed around pamphlets on Iran's campuses filled with advice and past experiences.
''Most of the students, when they come into university, they talk about coming to the United States,'' said Mr. Kamranzadeh, who studied at Shiraz University in Iran. ''The students do not care about the policy that the government tries to publicize. They know what they should do for themselves.''

HEADLINE: Glimmerglass Recycles Its Sets, Not Its Ideas

BYLINE: By STEVE SMITH

 BODY:
COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. -- It's hard not to think of the current Glimmerglass Opera season as something of a footnote, though that is patently unfair to the artists doing consistently solid and frequently inspired work here this summer. In February came the news that the general and artistic director, Michael MacLeod, would be leaving at the end of the current season. With the impending arrival of Francesca Zambello, the seasoned opera and musical theater director who will take over in September, comes the promise of fresh energy and change that extends even to the name of this venerable organization. Next year it becomes the Glimmerglass Festival.
Mr. MacLeod, in his five seasons here, never inspired the sort of buzz the well-connected Ms. Zambello has already generated. An able custodian of the house style cultivated by his predecessor, Paul Kellogg, Mr. MacLeod will probably be best remembered for two novel themed seasons -- Orpheus in 2007, Shakespeare in 2008 -- and for keeping Glimmerglass afloat during hard economic times. 
Still, you could wonder what impact belt-tightening had on the present season. As usual, Glimmerglass is presenting four operas in repertory: two mainstream staples (Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' Puccini's ''Tosca'') and two less-familiar works (Copland's ''Tender Land,'' Handel's ''Tolomeo''). For frugality's sake, presumably, Donald Eastman scavenged pieces from his 2005 Glimmerglass staging of Britten's ''Death in Venice'' for the sets of all four productions.
If saving money was an incentive, one benefit was a hint of unity underlying four disparate works. Each setting had roughly the same footprint, a mildly raked platform between two angled walls. A background of rippling grain and Robert Wierzel's sensitive lighting evoked fertile American plains in ''The Tender Land.'' Peeling paint and a broken-down wagon appeared in one tatty ''Figaro'' set; muted lights by Jeff Harris and gray, stony surfaces served efficiently for ''Tosca.''
Then there was ''Tolomeo,'' seen on Sunday, which the company presented as its first professional staging. No question, Glimmerglass has been a major force in the Handel revival of recent years. This particular opera, originally a star vehicle for the castrato Senesino and the divas Francesca Cuzzoni and Faustina Bordoni, was worth reviving for its splendid mix of intense arias and duets.
The scenario reads like tragedy. Tolomeo, a deposed prince of Egypt, endures exile disguised as a shepherd in Cyprus. He pines for his lost love, Seleuce, who, unbeknownst to him, is also in Cyprus disguised as a shepherdess. Araspe and Elisa, the Cypriot royals, plot to keep them apart, trying to enlist Alessandro, Tolomeo's shipwrecked brother, in their machinations.
Odd, then, that the director, Chas Rader-Shieber, read it as comedy and responded with obvious sight gags. Tolomeo, excitingly sung and vigorously acted by the incisive countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo, pondered his life's currents while peering into a goldfish bowl, with a swordfish dangled overhead. Seleuce, a poised and moving Joelle Harvey, bade the breezes convey her desires by singing into electric fans. Three supernumeraries -- usually crotchety servants, sometimes brooding henchmen -- undercut nobility in scene after scene.
Still, there was much to be savored. Julie Boulianne, flamboyantly costumed by Andrea Hood in what looked like Cyndi Lauper castoffs, was a brilliant Elisa, consistently engaged and engaging. Karin Mushegain and Steven LaBrie, from the Glimmerglass Young American Artists Program, were superb as Alessandro and Araspe. Christian Curnyn, the conductor, led a buoyant, stylish performance that showed the orchestra's estimable feel for Handel's idiom.
In ''Le Nozze di Figaro,'' heard on Friday, smart direction by Leon Major helped to overcome dull sets and variable singing in a businesslike account conducted by David Angus, the Glimmerglass music director.
Patrick Carfizzi sang well and acted better as Figaro, with Lyubov Petrova a dazzlingly playful Susanna; the evident affection between them was constantly invigorating. Mark Schnaible was a ruthless, conniving Almaviva, Caitlin Lynch a luminous Countess and Aurhelia Varak a perky Cherubino; Haeran Hong stood out in the tiny role of Barbarina. Jonathan Kelly, on fortepiano, provided elegant accompaniment during recitatives.
Copland wrote ''The Tender Land'' for youthful singers in 1953; seen on Saturday afternoon, it served as an apt vehicle for the first production entirely turned over to members of the Glimmerglass Young American Artists Program. Inspired by Walker Evans's Depression-era photographs in James Agee's ''Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,'' the opera contains some of Copland's most luminous strains, along with a libretto by Horace Everett (pen name of Erik Johns) that ranges from quiet poetry to mawkish sentimentality.
As Laurie, a teenager who yearns to experience the wider world beyond her grandfather's farm, Lindsay Russell sang with gracious tone and ample volume, soaring over the rich strains of Copland's original full orchestration. Andrew Stenson was a thoughtful, lyrical Martin, the drifter who briefly desires a settled life with Laurie; as Top, his travel companion, Mark Diamond was boisterous and entertaining.
Joseph Barron was a gruff Grandpa Moss, Stephanie Foley Davis a poised, touching Ma Moss. Apart from one stiff dance number, Tazewell Thompson's direction was unfailingly potent and insightful; Stewart Robertson, the conductor, drew outstanding playing from the orchestra.
''Tosca,'' heard on Saturday night, featured three powerful, occasionally overpowering leads. The soprano Lise Lindstrom brought a cool allure to the title role, her focused and steely voice flaring into palpable fire when it was called for. Adam Diegel was a dashing Cavaradossi, producing soaring high notes along with a tendency to adorn climaxes with old-fashioned sobs. Lester Lynch sang with hearty assurance as a brutal, thuggish Scarpia.
Aaron Sorensen and Robert Kerr made lively contributions in the smaller roles of Angelotti and the Sacristan. Ned Canty's intelligent direction, along with Matthew Pachtman's attractive early-20th-century costumes and Mr. Harris's sensitive lighting, combined for a lean yet imaginative production. And the orchestra, conducted by Mr. Angus, did outstanding work.
The Glimmerglass Opera season runs through Aug. 24; (607) 547-2255, glimmerglass.org.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A music review and a picture caption on Tuesday about the current season of Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., described incorrectly Glimmerglass's billing of ''Tolomeo,'' one of four works in repertory. The company is presenting ''Tolomeo'' as its first professional staging, not as the American stage premiere.

HEADLINE: N.B.A. Reaching Out to Develop African Talent

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

 BODY:
The basketball court, DeSagana Diop explains, is in Parcelles Assainies, the neighborhood in which he grew up in Dakar and the unlikely starting point for a nine-year N.B.A. career. Diop's parents, he says, still live in the neighborhood.
The space was just dirt and trash before Diop dedicated the court last week. ''Before we did it, it was nothing,'' Diop said by telephone from Dakar, the capital of Senegal, in western Africa. 
Its opening symbolizes another small step on a continent where the N.B.A. is attempting to take a great leap. The N.B.A. has extended its influence to Asia, and India is next on its ambitious docket. But the league has recently increased its efforts in Africa.
Besides some successes, like Hakeem Olajuwon of Nigeria, who was drafted by the Houston Rockets in 1984, the continent has been an area of mostly untapped or underdeveloped talent in a soccer-first region. The N.B.A. made pilgrimages to the continent and conducted camps and clinics, but the visits did not have a lasting effect.
This year, the N.B.A. named Dikembe Mutombo its global ambassador. In March, it opened its first office in Africa, in Johannesburg, under the guidance of Amadou Gallo Fall, a native of Senegal who discovered Diop and served as a Dallas Mavericks executive for a dozen years. And Basketball Without Borders, the international development and community outreach program, visited Senegal last week, the first time the camp was staged in Africa outside of Johannesburg.
''There's a lot of talent here,'' Diop said. ''We've just got to do more camps and teach the game more and more. They've got a lot of athletes. They've just got to learn the basics. Shooting, jumping, passing, and it's going to help the game of basketball.''
Diop led a contingent of N.B.A. personnel to Dakar that included his fellow African-born players Hasheem Thabeet and Luc Mbah a Moute and the Knicks' Danilo Gallinari of Italy and Ronny Turiaf of France. The players and a number of N.B.A. officials hosted 60 of the continent's top teenage players, who represented countries from Angola to Zambia.
Diop views himself from the same prism as many of his campers. He is luckier than most and did not scour for his next meal. His father was a high school principal and his mother a teacher. But like some of the campers, Diop ventured into basketball only after he grew too tall for soccer. Fall discovered Diop and funneled him to the United States and the high school basketball powerhouse Oak Hill Academy in Virginia, which has produced numerous N.B.A. stars. Diop progressed on the basketball court and, even more important, in the classroom. He was Oak Hill's valedictorian.
''He just needed to be given the tools, but you could tell that he had a lot of upside,'' Fall said. ''It was just a question of if he could get to the right place to learn the game.''
Diop entered the N.B.A. as an athlete with raw skills but plenty of promise. The Cleveland Cavaliers drafted him with the eighth overall pick in 2001, only four years after he first started to play the game. In four seasons with Cleveland, Diop was deemed a bust. The learning curve had proved high. He resuscitated his career by contributing to a finals-bound Dallas Mavericks squad and is now a reserve center with the Charlotte Bobcats.
Diop says he sometimes wonders if he would have become a star with better tutelage as a youth. Fall, a former microbiologist who played at the University of the District of Columbia, wonders the same thing. While he once sought to export players to learn the game, Fall now wants Africa to serve as the learning ground.
''You see so many people here who don't have the fortunes of learning or developing their skills, and their talents go to waste,'' Fall said. ''That's why we're so happy to impact basketball at the ground-roots level and to teach young people that they don't have to necessarily go somewhere else to learn their skills.''
Diop has made the trek back almost annually. In 2003, he and Fall started the Seeds Academy in Senegal, an acronym for Sports for Education and Economic Development. Diop is quick to point out that basketball is only one aspect of life that he teaches.
''It's not just about basketball,'' he said. ''It's about life in general. Not everybody is going to make it to the N.B.A. I want to help teach them that they can be anything. They can be teachers. They can be doctors.''
Some, though, do advance in the game. Diop can still recall a lanky and athletic Mbah a Moute at the camp in 2003. ''Now I'm playing against him in the N.B.A.,'' he said with a chuckle. ''How crazy is that?''
Perhaps, it was once far-fetched. Now such progress is rooted in reality. Two other products from the Basketball Without Borders program in Africa -- Christian Eyenga, the Cavaliers' 2009 first-round draft selection, and Solomon Alabi of the Toronto Raptors -- signed N.B.A. contracts this summer.
The signings were more inroads in the search not for symbolic gestures but for meaningful influence and development.
''Everybody wants to be associated with something special,'' Fall said. ''We all hold dear to our heart where we are from, and basketball is a huge tool that can impact the community.''

HEADLINE: Battlegrounds in 6 States in Midwest

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
Who occupies the statehouse in a swath of states near the Great Lakes could prove crucial in the 2012 presidential campaign. A primer to some races to watch:
ILLINOISPatrick J. Quinn, a Democrat and lieutenant-governor-turned-governor with the unraveling of Rod R. Blagojevich, would just as soon everyone forget his predecessor (and his current corruption trial) and the state's troubling $12 billion deficit. No Republican holds a statewide office here, and many in the Chicago area had never heard of the Republican candidate, Bill Brady, a downstate social conservative, but this is not just any election year, and this race is competitive.
IOWA It has been a long four years for Gov. Chet Culver, a Democrat finishing his first term and hoping for another. The economy is bad, and so are his approval ratings. Terry Branstad, a Republican who was governor for 16 years in the 1980s and '90s, is trying a comeback. And for all the talk of how the national mood is turning against old, establishment politicians, some Iowans seem to be seeking comfort in something worn. 
MICHIGAN This state never came back from the last recession, and that has always overshadowed the tenure of Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat. Term limits barred her from seeking re-election, and Rick Snyder, a businessman who has never held office, beat four other Republicans (including the state attorney general and a member of Congress) last week to become the party's nominee. His unusual campaign pitch portrayed him as ''One Tough Nerd.'' The focus on Mr. Snyder's rise has eclipsed the Democrat's nominee, Virg Bernero, the mayor of Lansing.
MINNESOTA Tom Emmer, a Republican state lawmaker who has the state party's endorsement for the nomination, is seen by many as further right than Minnesota likes to go. His comments in support of Arizona's new immigration law apparently provoked an activist to dump a pile of pennies on him a few weeks ago. But this state is independent and does what it likes (think Jesse Ventura, the former governor and professional wrestler). So the race to replace Gov. Tim Pawlenty, the Republican who appears to be thinking about the White House, is expected to be close. In Tuesday's Democratic primary, the front-runners are Mark Dayton, a former United States senator; Matt Entenza, a former state lawmaker; and Margaret Anderson Kelliher, the speaker of the State House.
OHIO The nation's economic woes seep through the contest here, which pits Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat, against John R. Kasich, a Republican and former congressman. This may be the swingiest of swing states, and national leaders know that the winner of the governor's race will also decide which party has the advantage (in volunteer and fund-raising lists and get-out-the vote operations) in the 2012 presidential fight.
WISCONSIN This is likely to shape up as a battle between the county executive of Milwaukee County and the mayor of Milwaukee, so some in the rest of the state would just as soon not hear any more from its most populous metropolitan region. Scott Walker, the county executive who is likely to win the Republican primary in September, tells anyone who will listen about his wish for common-sense spending, smaller government and less red tape for business. Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, unintentionally increased his statewide recognition a year ago when he stepped in to break up a domestic dispute at the State Fair and seriously injured his right hand. The incident drew wide coverage, and Mr. Barrett still has to mostly shake with his left hand. At stake is the office being vacated by Gov. James E. Doyle, a Democrat, who chose not to run again.

HEADLINE: How to Fight Plagiarism on Campus

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''For Students in Internet Age, No Shame in Copy and Paste'' (''Cheat Sheet'' series, front page, Aug. 2) illustrates the challenge of combating academic dishonesty on college campuses.
As an associate professor of history and academic integrity officer at the New York City College of Technology, CUNY, I hear a range of responses from students charged with dishonesty. 
While it is certainly true that Wikipedia and digital file sharing have contributed to an increase in plagiarism, academic dishonesty can also be attributed to a broader societal ''culture of cheating'' that emphasizes ends over means.
As this article makes clear, many students who know exactly what they are doing when they plagiarize do so because they are lazy. The response I hear most from students who have plagiarized is not having had time to write their papers themselves. Because the reasons students plagiarize are so various, our efforts to combat this serious problem must also be various.
Peter Parides Astoria, Queens, Aug. 2, 2010
To the Editor:
Your article draws attention to an increasing problem facing college professors and administrators. In some cases, students genuinely do not know what does and what doesn't constitute plagiarism, but in many instances they know exactly what they're doing.
My approach is to distribute a plagiarism ''quiz'' on the first day of class that we take and discuss together. The ''quiz'' is designed to make clear what academic dishonesty is; address the reasons students plagiarize; explain why it is a serious offense; warn students how easy it is for them to get caught; spell out what the consequences will be if they are found to have plagiarized; and go over the guidelines for citing sources properly.
Although the ''quiz'' has not completely eliminated plagiarism in my undergraduate courses, it does ensure that students know what it is and what will happen if they resort to it.
John Gruesser Union, N.J., Aug. 2, 2010
The writer is a professor of English at Kean University.
To the Editor:
Although digital technology may contribute to blurring the lines of academic honesty, equally important may be the reluctance of colleges to expel students for plagiarism, a violation that cuts to the core of the academy's mission. The prospect of expulsion would clarify matters quickly.
Adam Clark Arcadi Trumansburg, N.Y., Aug. 2, 2010
The writer is an associate professor of anthropology at Cornell University.
To the Editor:
Your coverage of plagiarism on campus has emphasized the uses of new digital technologies by students and instructors. But it has not recognized one of the most important contributors to the problem: the use of writing assignments that promote plagiarism.
If instructors simply call for a 10-page paper to be handed in on the last day of class, they are inviting the sort of ''cut and paste'' plagiarism that has become all too common on our campuses.
But if they take the time to design more complex assignments, which might require multiple drafts and peer review, they can circumvent this problem. At the same time, they will do much more to enhance students' writing skills and learning.
Instead of bemoaning the state of today's youth or relying on anti-cheat software, we should understand the current plagiarism problem as a sign that we need to find ways to teach more effectively.
Mark Wilson Charlotte, N.C., Aug. 2, 2010
The writer is an associate professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
To the Editor:
As a lawyer and adjunct law professor who has caught too many law school students plagiarizing papers recently, I fully appreciate your article's emphasis on the legal and sociological aspects of academic-context plagiarism. But one concern here may transcend even intellectual property, copyright law and the Internet generation's concept of authorship: fraud on the professor.
The purpose of journalism and other published writing is to inform, educate or entertain. But the purpose of student writing is very different: demonstrating original thought and grasp of the material. Copyright violations and the concept of author's credit may be only a secondary issue when a student submits a paper to an audience of just one, with no expectation of pay.
Think about that duped professor, up late in bed grading a well-plagiarized paper, haplessly scribbling ''Great point!'' or ''Trenchant analysis!'' or just ''Yes!'' but inadvertently critiquing the thought of some Wikipedia-page writer or author of some decades-old book review. Our professor -- whether he awards the paper an A-plus or a B-minus (pretty much the full spectrum in today's grade-inflationary economy) -- is a chump wasting his time evaluating the wrong person's ideas and crediting a thief. Donald C. Dowling Jr. Scarsdale, N.Y., Aug. 2, 2010
To the Editor:
To put one's name to language crafted by others is public acknowledgment that the perpetrator lacks all sense of pride and self-worth. Such a thief will never know the deep pleasure, the joys, of creativity and deserves only our pity and contempt.
Richard C. Doenges Gainesville, Fla., Aug. 2, 2010

HONG KONG -- China's trade surplus surged last month to its highest level in a year and a half, while real estate prices leveled off, according to government data released Tuesday that pointed to possible trade frictions with the United States and slightly slower economic growth in China.
Stock markets across Asia weakened in response to the latest economic statistics, which included an unexpected slump in China's imports that seemed to suggest a softening of demand. 
The Shanghai share market fell nearly 3 percent, and the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong tumbled 1.5 percent. Stock markets in countries like Australia that rely on commodity exports to China also dipped.
China's trade surplus climbed to $28.7 billion in July, the largest total since January of last year, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs. That was much more than the consensus expectation of economists for a surplus of about $19 billion, and it easily exceeded a surplus of $19.6 billion in June.
Economists said that the Chinese economy was likely to slow in the months ahead but not sharply, with annual growth edging below 10 percent later this year or sometime next year. A wealth of figures scheduled for release Wednesday will give a more complete picture of economic output and demand in China.
But two economists at HSBC, Qu Hongbin and Sun Junwei, said in a joint research note that demand in China for raw materials seemed to be weakening, with a falling tonnage last month of imports of crude oil, iron ore, copper and aluminum.
China's central bank announced June 19 that it would begin to allow the country's currency, the renminbi, to begin fluctuating more against other currencies, a decision that the United States and others expected to lead to the renminbi's appreciation against the dollar. But the pace of that appreciation has been very slow so far, with the renminbi rising only 0.8 percent against the U.S. dollar since then.
Many U.S. politicians have argued that China is keeping the renminbi weak to lift its exports, giving China an unfair trade advantage and creating large trade surpluses. A stronger renminbi would make Chinese exports more expensive in foreign markets and would make foreign goods more affordable for Chinese buyers.
Imports rose 22.7 percent in July from a year earlier, less than half the annual growth rate seen in June. But exports leaped 38.1 percent from an already strong showing in the same month last year, while imports rose a more modest 22.7 percent.
China's policy of releasing a quick snapshot of trade less than two weeks after the end of each month provides one of the earliest glimpses of the strength of international demand, particularly for the consumer goods with which China increasingly dominates global markets. Some economists had expected growth in Chinese exports to weaken last month in an early sign of a possible double-dip recession in the West.
Some Chinese corporate executives are still worried about the possibility of a slowdown in exports in the months ahead.
Allen Dong, the export manager of the Ningbo Deye Domestic Electrical Appliance Technology Company in Ningbo, China, said that the orders for future exports of the company's dehumidifiers to the United States and Europe had begun to weaken this summer. ''I think this may be partly due to the fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate against other currencies, and also the forever changing economic situation overseas,'' he said.
Like many Chinese companies, Ningbo Deye is trying to cushion its reliance on volatile exports by selling more in the domestic market. Domestic sales are now 55 percent of revenues and exports are the rest, compared with an even split last year, Mr. Dong said.
On Tuesday morning, the central bank set the opening value of the renminbi in Shanghai trading at 6.7745 to the dollar. That meant the renminbi was actually slightly weaker than on Monday, when it traded at 6.7685 to the dollar.
The central bank dominates trading of the renminbi through heavy intervention in the Shanghai market, selling renminbi heavily and buying U.S. dollars so as to prevent China's trade surpluses and inflows of foreign investment from pushing up the value of the renminbi.
China's General Administration of Customs announced the trade data in the middle of Tuesday morning. The National Bureau of Statistics announced separately Tuesday morning that average home prices in 70 large and medium-size Chinese cities were unchanged in July from June and up 10.3 percent in July compared with the level in the same month last year.
The Chinese government has been trying since last spring to cool speculation in real estate markets. It has done so partly to limit the potential vulnerability of banks to mortgage defaults if real estate prices fall later, but also in response to a public outcry within China about the high cost of housing, as many young people question how they will be able to afford their first home.
July was the third consecutive month of slowing in the appreciation of real estate prices from a year earlier. But housing starts and construction have remained strong this summer, suggesting that the sector continues to contribute to China's overall economic growth.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Monsoon Rains Continue in Flood-Ravaged Pakistan

BYLINE: By SALMAN MASOOD

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Monsoon rains fell on several parts of Pakistan on Monday, causing landslides in the north, raising water levels in already bloated rivers and further hindering the government's aid efforts. 
Pakistan's Meteorological Department forecast more rain for the next 24 hours, adding further hardship for the millions of people affected by Pakistan's worst flooding in 80 years.
Thousands of people started fleeing the city of Muzaffargarh in southern Punjab Province after the authorities issued flood warnings, according to local news reports.
A special train was sent to carry residents to safety to the nearby city Multan, but local news reports suggested that government officials were unable to manage the evacuation in an orderly manner.
Pakistani television broadcast images of people sitting on trucks, buses and tractors as they made their way out of the city. Many more were faced with fuel shortages in the city.
Helicopter service remained suspended in northern Swat Valley because of bad weather in the early part of the day.
United States military helicopters resumed operations later in the afternoon around 2:30 p.m. and rescued 500 people in Kalam and other parts of Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa Province, a spokesman for the United States Embassy said.
The valley remains cut off from rest of the country, with major bridges and roads washed away and landslides blocking a major road leading into the valley.
Hundreds of thousands of people were left stranded and in need of food, medication and clean drinking water, according to rescue workers. Aid workers were using donkeys or traveling by foot to reach people.
In Sindh Province in southern Pakistan, water levels continued to rise at Sukkur Barrage, raising fears that the dam might not be able to withstand the force of water. Three spillways and six canals were opened Monday to ease the water pressure.
President Asif Ali Zardari was scheduled to return to Pakistan on Monday from a European trip. Mr. Zardari drew stinging criticism for being abroad as the disaster unfolded.
The United Nations has said about six million people in Pakistan have been affected by the floods and at least 1,500 have died.
''This is a very major disaster, on the same scale as the earthquake of 2005,'' Maurizio Giuliano, public information officer for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said in a statement.
The United Nations has estimated that more than three million people were affected and 73,000 people killed in the 2005 earthquake in Kashmir.
Government officials seemed overwhelmed and daunted by the magnitude of the devastation caused by the floods.
Hina Rabbani Khar, the state minister for economic affairs, broke into tears as she described the plight of her constituency in the Muzaffargarh district of southwestern Punjab to Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani during a meeting that was broadcast live on state-run television.
''We were not prepared for this kind of a disaster,'' Ms. Khar said, her voice quivering and tears running down her face. ''People have not had food or drinking water for the past seven days,''

HEADLINE: Shares Gain as Investors Await Fed Meeting

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stocks closed higher on Monday, but trading was light as investors were hesitant to act before the next Federal Reserve meeting.
Shares of telecommunications companies, consumer goods makers, financials and industrials drove the indexes higher, even after recent tepid economic reports that showed a weak job market and slack retail sales.
On Monday, with no economic indicators released, investors appeared to take what little incentive there was for direction from corporate reports, including one from McDonald's. 
The chain said that sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 7 percent over all, and 5.7 percent in the crucial American market. The company's shares gained 1.6 percent.
''I am encouraged that a lot of consumer stocks were up today, as were many of the industrials,'' said Stuart A. Schweitzer, global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
''I think what is going on is, people who reacted initially very negatively the moment that the employment figure came out took a cooler, calmer look,'' Mr. Schweitzer said.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 45.19 points, or 0.42 percent, at 10,698.75. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.15 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,127.79, and the Nasdaq gained 17.22 points, or 0.75 percent, to 2,305.69.
Hewlett-Packard shares closed down $3.40, or 7.4 percent, at $42.60 on Monday. After the markets closed on Friday, H.P. said that the company's chief, Mark V. Hurd, was ousted from his job after he falsified expense reports to try to hide his relationship with a marketing consultant.
Google and Verizon on Monday introduced a proposal for how Internet service should be regulated, though they were criticized by groups that favor keeping the network as open as possible. Google shares rose $5.13 to $505.35. Verizon was up 31 cents to $29.86.
Despite the gains in the markets, analysts said investors were waiting to see what the Federal Reserve policy-making committee might announce after its meeting on Tuesday, especially after a jobs report on Friday came in weaker than expected.
''There certainly is a building concern and now added uncertainty about what the Fed might do or say,'' said James W. Paulsen, the chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management.
Ralph Fogel, investment strategist and partner at Fogel Neale Partners, said there was renewed talk that the Fed would start quantitative easing measures, which would involve buying financial assets to hold down long-term interest rates and increase the supply of money.
''People are waiting for the Fed tomorrow,'' Mr. Fogel said. ''We are in a precarious situation with the interest rates declining, and everybody being fearful of going backwards and decelerating.''
Concerns about the economy sharpened last week after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the country lost 131,000 jobs and private employers added 71,000 jobs last month, less than the analysts' expectations of an additional 90,000 jobs.
That contributed to a rally in the bond market, with investors bidding up prices as yields declined. Two-year Treasury note yields briefly fell below 0.50 percent for the first time ever.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 3/32, to 105 22/32. The yield rose to 2.83 percent, from 2.82 percent on Friday.
On Monday, investors seemed reluctant to depart safe haven assets, said Kevin H. Giddis, executive managing director and president of fixed income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company.
''It appears that investors are taking some money off the table, waiting, and then looking for a spot to get back in,'' Mr. Giddis said. ''That is what is facing the Fed this week as they meet to discuss some way, any way, to get the U.S. economy growing at a pace necessary to create jobs.''
The Fed has only a few tools left, Mr. Giddis said in a research note. It could drop the federal funds rate to almost zero, reduce the interest it pays on excess reserves, or buy more securities.
Markets were up in Europe, lifted by a report showing strong export growth in Germany. Both the FTSE 100 in London and the DAX in Frankfurt rose about 1.5 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris was 61.32 points, or 1.65 percent, higher.

HEADLINE: For Travel Industry, Things Are Looking Up

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HOUSTON
AT the National Business Travel Association's noisy opening-night reception inside the convention center here on Sunday, strobe lights flashed and long lines formed for food and drinks. Some danced as a nine-piece rhythm and blues band blasted into a ballroom.
''Better than last year?'' I shouted to a young woman who was dancing by herself. 
''Anything's better than that,'' she yelled back.
True enough.
There are clear signs that the business-travel industry, which drives the fortunes of a large segment of the economy including airlines and hotels, is gradually coming back. Attendance at the convention is about 6,000 this year, said Caleb Tiller, a spokesman for the trade group, which represents corporate travel buyers and suppliers like airlines. That makes it second only to the 2008 convention in Los Angeles, held on the cusp of the collapse in travel.
That collapse has ended. Most domestic airlines recently reported healthy second-quarter profits, citing a rebound in business travel. After two of its worst years ever, the hotel industry is digging out. American Express reported here Monday that airfares had risen substantially and were climbing ''steadily towards prerecession levels'' in the first half 2010. Though hotel rates are down slightly, travel managers are finding that negotiations with hotels for next year have become tougher.
Airfares are now the highest they have been since the start of 2008, said Christa Degnan Manning, a research director with American Express Business Travel. ''With travelers on the road again, air suppliers have gained ground in pricing power, and the end of hotel rate drops is likely near,'' she said.
That may be great for shareholders of airlines and hotels, but not necessarily for travelers. Corporate travel managers are insisting on adherence to strict travel policies, like staying at chains where they have negotiated discounts. After all, they're dealing with airlines that so far have kept smaller capacity in line with demand.
At the same time, airline mergers are leading to less competition, while worldwide alliances are allowing carriers to meld routes and operations.
''With volume returning, airline alliances and mergers increasing, and increased competition for the airplane seats available, companies need to be more aggressive this year to find the best fares,'' Ms. Manning said. ''This also means travelers need to change behavior and be aware of preferred supplier discounts.''
There is some bright news for travelers in the form of the much-anticipated Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Continental Airlines, the first North American carrier that will fly it, showed it off on the exhibition floor on Monday. Well, not the whole airplane, but a full-size mockup of a cabin section.
Five years ago, I wrote about the first mockup of the 787 cabin at Boeing's plant in Seattle. I'm happy to say that despite the delays in getting the plane to market, Boeing has lived up to its promise of a revolutionary interior in an airplane made mostly of lightweight carbon-fiber composites.
Boeing is marketing the plane as 20 percent more fuel-efficient than its 767s, which the 787 will replace on many longer routes. Its windows are bigger than ones on other planes; the cabin is more spacious and is engineered for higher humidity levels to combat in-flight dryness. The overhead bins are the industry's largest.
Continental expects delivery next year of the first of the 25 Boeing 787s it has ordered, and plans to begin flying between Houston and Auckland, New Zealand, as well as Houston and Lagos, Nigeria, in November 2011.
Continental, which is merging with United, plans to fly its 787s with 36 seats in its premium BusinessFirst cabin and 192 in coach. For the first time in ages, the coach cabin will offer a degree of comfort instead of varying degrees of physical misery.
''After a long flight, passengers should feel good no matter what class they flew in,'' said Kent D. Craver, a Boeing marketing executive.
The tight budgets mean business fliers and travel managers will ''need to have more agility,'' said Lane Dubin, a vice president for American Express Business Travel.
And that seems to fit with Continental's plans for the 787 as more people move to coach. ''That's where we think we're going to do very well with the business traveler,'' said Dave Hilfman, Continental's senior vice president for worldwide sales.

HEADLINE: Some Exuberance For Skype's I.P.O.

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN and CHRISTOPHER SWANN

 BODY:
Skype's initial public offering may add a dose of healthy hype to Silicon Valley. The Internet telephone group's $100 million float should be red hot. While there have been several tech offerings this year, investor reception has been uneven. A bit of justified excitement over Skype's growth and its backers' gains is just what the Valley's capitalists -- and entrepreneurs -- need.
With hot companies like Facebook and Zynga ruling out public floats in the near future, growth investors are hungry for the next big ticket. Skype obliges. It has 560 million registered users and continues to grow. It added 86 million in the first six months of the year. Moreover, it is in the black. Skype has $116 million of adjusted Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) since January, and this figure could grow rapidly if the company succeeds in cracking the lucrative business market. 
Moreover, Skype is big. If its estimated 2011 revenue of $1 billion is valued on the same multiple as Google, the company might be worth more than $5 billion. That would be a huge gain for the private equity backers at Silver Lake who led Skype's carve-out from eBay, clarified copyright issues with its founders and tweaked its software. They valued it at $2.75 billion at purchase in 2009.
Valuing Skype in line with Google may sound optimistic. But there's the issue of scarcity -- the $100 million sale of stock is minuscule. This could set off a scramble for the available shares, sending them rocketing.
The Valley needs a bit of this sort of ebullience. Venture capitalists are sitting on a huge backlog of companies that could go public, which is one reason the average fund established since 1998 hasn't made any profits for investors. Sure, there have been 11 tech I.P.O.'s this year and more in the pipeline, like Demand Media. But the average I.P.O. is up less than 2.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.
That's not much to write home about, and certainly not a big draw for sellers or buyers. A successful Skype offer would be a different story. Investors would presumably clamor for more of the same, increasing valuations on tech firms that earn money on social applications. If there's enough appetite, it could even tempt companies like Facebook, Zynga and Yelp to consider selling shares to the public. Skype deserves some hype.
Peak Oil's Prophet
Peak Oil has lost its leading prophet with the death of Matt Simmons on Sunday. Since many nations refuse to share intimate oil data, it may be years before his warnings of ebbing production are vindicated -- or discredited. But his crusade for more data on supplies is as urgent as ever.
A highly successful banker and the patriarch of Simmons & Company International, Mr. Simmons added plenty of gravitas to the ''peak oil'' movement, which contains more than its share of nuts. His 2005 book, ''Twilight in the Desert,'' took on the biggest oil producer of all, Saudi Arabia. Drawing on 200 technical papers, he concluded that the kingdom's largest oil field, Ghawar, would soon run out of oil. As a result, oil's friendly giant would soon start to struggle to keep up with rising global oil demand.
Unlike M. King Hubbert, the founding father of the peak oil theory, Mr. Simmons was a financier and not a geologist. Thus his scientific grasp was sometimes questioned. Saudi Aramco's former head of reservoir management, Nansen Saleri, quipped that he could read 200 studies on neurology and nobody would want him to operate on their brain.
Recent developments have cast doubt on the notion that geology will be the immediate problem. Advances in deep sea drilling have brought huge reservoirs within reach off the coasts of West Africa, Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. As prices have risen, Canada's trove of oil sands becomes economical to extract. And, politics permitting, huge reserves of cheap oil may be drilled in Iraq.
This does not invalidate Mr. Simmons's arguments. With the fate of the global economy hinging on a reliable energy supply, it is dangerous to blindly trust big oil producers' own estimates of their reserves. Any transition away from oil, after all, would need to be planned for decades in advance. Mr. Simmons' quest for more information should not die with him. ROBERT CYRAN and CHRISTOPHER SWANN

HEADLINE: Maybe Bradley Should Make the First Move

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
East Rutherford, N.J.
The timing could not have been better for Bob Bradley, who is coaching the United States soccer team on Tuesday with no guarantee there will be many more games for him at the end of his four-year contract.
As the American players assembled Monday at New Meadowlands Stadium for an exhibition game against Brazil, Bradley fielded questions about a job opening at Aston Villa in the English Premier League. 
Martin O'Neill quit on Monday, apparently disenchanted because the team's American owner, Randy Lerner, who also owns the Cleveland Browns, had allowed a couple of talented players to move to other teams. O'Neill's departure allowed reporters to ask Bradley if he was interested.
''To coach in Europe is something I'd like to do at some point,'' Bradley said, diplomatically.
Bradley has been waiting for clarification since the United States lost to Ghana on June 26. With World Cup coaches like Dunga of Brazil and Diego Maradona of Argentina already gone -- high expectations and all that -- the United States has a policy of hiring coaches through the end of the year.
In 2006, Bruce Arena was let go shortly after the World Cup, but that was because Arena came to the federation with another job offer, and Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, made the decision he would have made, anyway.
Gulati's first impulse then was to hire Jurgen Klinsmann, fresh from his third-place finish with Germany, but Klinsmann made so many demands that the federation could not accommodate him. That was how Bradley went from interim coach to solid, respectable national coach.
After the United States was eliminated from this year's World Cup in the Round of 16 in the weakest of four quadrants, Gulati used the phrase ''mixed results'' as the Yanks headed home. Six weeks later, Bradley is still answering questions.
The problem is, the stakes have risen. The United States has discovered soccer, even as a quadrennial taste, like Olympic figure skating or gymnastics. A critical mass of American sports fans is aware of the Champions League, the Premier League, other crack European leagues and the homegrown Major League Soccer, better than it used to be. (Thierry Henry of France and Rafa Marquez of Mexico are expected to make their home debuts with the Red Bulls on Wednesday night in their intimate new stadium in Harrison, N.J. Good luck finding a ticket.)
Bradley is caught up in this rising tide, judged by expectations that previous coaches, even Arena, did not face. The relatively easy regional qualifying process for the World Cup puts the United States in striking range of the quarterfinals.
Any evaluation of the United States team must begin with the tentative starts that put the Yanks behind in all four World Cup matches. A few debatable lineup moves -- among them the disaster of Ricardo Clark in the early minutes against Ghana -- also hang over this decision.
At this stage, the best American players, largely based overseas, are gaining experience and skills in the European leagues. Would another coach, perhaps with international experience, find a way to unleash more positive energy at the start of games? There is no guarantee.
Because of his character and intelligence, Bradley would probably be a better coach the second time around, with no burnout. But he may not get that chance. It can only be assumed that Gulati is looking around. Up to now, my position has been that American players would respond best to an American coach, but many of them have already dealt -- and thrived -- under coaches of many nationalities, so that is less of an issue than in the past.
Klinsmann might not be the X's and O's coach that Bradley is, but he played and coached in the World Cup, and Gulati says those two factors are important. Klinsmann energized the German team in 2006, and as a resident of California, he has the feel for the American mentality.
If Klinsmann is still pricing himself out of the market, the United States could also inquire about Carlos Queiroz, the coach of Portugal, who made a good impression during a short stint leading the MetroStars. And there could be a dozen other candidates.
The trick for Bradley is to be a candidate himself. This Brazil match comes at the right time for him. Gulati, who is an economist, used the phrase ''interesting opportunity'' for the exhibition. In the economics trade, the word interesting undoubtedly means lucrative. Gulati undoubtedly teaches supply and demand in his classes at Columbia University. A little demand could give a sense of urgency to Bradley's status right about now. He admitted that somebody looked into the Fulham vacancy over the summer. That same somebody should be working the phones right now.
Bradley would be a fine choice for another four years, but if the American job or the Aston Villa job does not work out, he should do what his son, Michael, is doing, and go to Europe for whatever job he could get -- even as an assistant for a club or national team. There are reasons so many coaches leave after each World Cup.

FOR MANY BRITONS,
Cuts Are Quick and Painful
The new British coalition government is preparing to shrink down to its bare bones as it cuts expenditures by $130 billion over the next five years and drastically scales back its responsibilities. Until recently, the cuts were just election talking points, early warnings of a new age of austerity. But now the pain has begun. PAGE A4

HEADLINE: With Redistricting and 2012 in Mind, Parties Focus on Governorships

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- For all the talk of midterm elections and control of Congress, the political parties are obsessing this year more than ever over the nation's 37 races for governor.
The Republican Governors Association has already poured $11 million into these campaigns, and halfway through the year had raised $28 million -- more than its entire budget for the 2006 election season -- bringing its current reserves to $40 million.
The Democratic Governors Association says it intends to devote $50 million to these races, nearly three times as much as ever, and the Democratic National Committee has dedicated as much direct financing to governors' races as it has to Senate and House campaigns.
The White House is also pitching in. President Obama is scheduled to fly to Wisconsin next Monday to raise money for Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee, who is trying to keep the governorship in Democratic hands, and, two days later, Mr. Obama will do the same in Ohio for Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat in a tight re-election race and someone for whom the White House has already dispatched others, including the vice president, four times so far this year. 
There is ample cause for so much attention. At stake is far more than local policy making in a few state capitals. The new crop of governors will play a major role in deciding which party benefits from the pivotal redrawing next year of Congressional and state legislative districts, a once-in-a-decade occurrence.
Across a swath of states here, near the Great Lakes, especially, Republican leaders sense a rare opportunity to seize key governorships that have been dominated recently by Democrats.
The results in the Midwest will also help to define crucial party organizing efforts leading up to the 2012 presidential campaign in some of the most coveted, up-for-grab states -- like Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. A governor, the thinking goes, can open fund-raising doors, get-out-the-vote operations and volunteer lists for his or her party's presidential candidate.
''Looking through the scope of national politics, I would make the case that the governors' races this year are as important as the federal races, if not more important,'' said Nick Ayers, the executive director of the Republican Governors Association.
In a year with an especially large number of governor elections -- made even larger by a special election in Utah -- an unusually high portion of them, 24, are for open seats, meaning that nearly half of the states (and probably more) will have new leaders after the midterm elections.
For those running in these governors' races, the national ramifications rarely seem far from view. ''This is really a 10-year election,'' Tom Emmer, a Republican candidate for governor in Minnesota, said as he rode toward Duluth in a 32-foot R.V. while campaigning recently before Tuesday's primary. Some Midwestern states are expected to lose seats in Congress under the redrawing of political districts that will follow the 2010 census, making the decisions about how these districts are redrawn of particular concern.
''If the Democrats win the governor's office, they will be in charge of redistricting Minnesota, and you can almost guarantee that they will try to squeeze out Michele Bachmann's Congressional district in that equation,'' Mr. Emmer said, referring to Representative Bachmann, a conservative Republican who recently started a Tea Party Caucus in Congress.
So focused are party leaders on the redistricting fight ahead that Democrats have created a small donor fund-raising program -- called Project Surge (for Stop Republican Gerrymandering) -- aimed around the remap ahead.
As it stands, 26 governors are Democrats and 24 are Republican. Of the 37 seats up for election this year, just over half are held by Democrats. And of the 24 incumbents who are not running for re-election -- because of term limits, poor odds of winning or something else entirely -- the political parties are evenly split.
But in a moment of anti-Washington, anti-incumbent sentiment, grim economic times and a Democratic administration, most agree that the odds do not favor Democrats. A president's party generally loses five or so seats in a midterm election, said Nathan Daschle, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association.
''As difficult as we knew this year would be, given both a historic midterm effect and a Bush economic hangover, voters still want to move forward to a brighter future,'' Mr. Daschle said. ''What they do not want is to go back to the failed Republican policies that created this mess.''
Some nonpartisan observers, however, are predicting a modest but potentially important shift to the Republicans. Jennifer Duffy, who tracks governors' races for the Cook Political Report, said that she expected the parties to swap governors' seats here and there in November, but that, in the end, Republicans would probably gain three to five seats.
Karl Rove, the Republican strategist, said he saw opportunities for sweeping gains through the industrial Midwest and into other national battlegrounds -- like Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon -- all of which would create new obstacles for an Obama re-election bid.
Months of campaigning, of course, still loom -- which Democrats are quick to point out.
''I think the G.O.P. insiders are so cocky and overconfident right now that they are acting like they have won all these,'' Mr. Barrett, the Democratic candidate in Wisconsin, said last week after speaking at opening ceremonies of the State Fair in West Allis. ''By the time we get to November, the voters are going to want to change again.''
Mr. Barrett's likely Republican opponent, Scott Walker, the executive of Milwaukee County, has been crisscrossing the state for months, talking to factory workers in dozens of brown-bag lunches, and cautioning that a Governor Barrett would mean four more years of the same economic policies as Gov. James E. Doyle, a Democrat who, amid anemic approval ratings, decided not to seek a third term.
''Austerity is in,'' said Mr. Walker, who regularly reminds audiences that he has for years carried brown-bag lunches (two ham-and-cheese sandwiches) to his office and is pledging to shrink the size of state government. ''For me, the ultimate question I tell voters is: If you feel like the last eight years of Jim Doyle has helped the economy of Wisconsin, then you should vote for Tom Barrett.''
While issues like education, illegal immigration, same-sex marriage, high-speed rail and energy have emerged in some of the races for governor, the conversation this season in nearly every state almost always swiftly returns to the economy: the mostly dismal state budget deficits, disappearing jobs and high unemployment.
''I hear it in virtually every part of the state,'' said Mr. Barrett, who said he himself was ''not happy with where things are,'' and sometimes imagined arriving at the governor's office to find, among the welcome baskets and flower bouquets, an unwanted gift -- a $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion deficit, the size of Wisconsin's budget gap.
''There is dissatisfaction and uneasiness,'' Mr. Barrett said. ''That's real.''
Mr. Barrett, who has proposed a ''Put Madison on a Diet'' program, has notably not campaigned with Mr. Doyle (though the two have appeared together at times), nor, Mr. Barrett says, does he agree with all of the governor's programs.
Perhaps in a reflection of unease, another trend has emerged in the governors' races: a wave of nontraditional campaigns. In three New England states, independents are seen as true contenders. Elsewhere, business people who have never (or rarely) sought political office are emerging as nominees. Last week, Rick Snyder, who once led Gateway Inc. and has never won public office, beat two longtime elected officials for the Republican nomination for governor in Michigan, a state held by a departing Democrat and which Republicans have high hopes of capturing in November.

HEADLINE: A Shunned Obama Campaigns in Texas

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex. -- President Obama shared an enthusiastic handshake and a hearty clap on the shoulder with this state's Republican governor, Rick Perry, when Air Force One touched down here on Monday.
But while Mr. Perry, who is running for re-election, stood on the tarmac and clapped for the president, his Democratic challenger, Bill White, was nowhere to be seen.
The decision by Mr. White, a former mayor of Houston, to avoid the visit of a sitting president from his own party needed little explanation: as a moderate Democrat in a state controlled by Republicans, he could ill afford to cozy up to Mr. Obama, who is being characterized as a tax-and-spend liberal by some of Texas' more conservative politicians, and by Mr. White himself. 
The disappearing act by Mr. White, who said he would be on the campaign trail elsewhere in the state, points up a conundrum for Mr. Obama in this midterm election season. While the president remains a powerful fund-raiser for the Democratic Party -- he brought in more than $1.6 million on Monday during back-to-back events in Austin and Dallas -- his travels do not always sit well with the candidates whose campaigns he is hoping to help.
Some are distancing themselves. During Mr. Obama's recent visit to Georgia, Roy Barnes, the former governor who is running to reclaim his job, found reason to stay away. Here in Texas, as Mr. White made himself scarce, Republicans made hay of the visit, with a news release featuring a picture of Mr. Obama in a cowboy hat under the headline ''Alone on the Range.''
The president paired his fund-raising swing with a policy event, a speech at the University of Texas, Austin, in which he made the case that ''education is an economic issue'' and restated his call for the United States to produce an additional eight million college graduates by the year 2020.
But the bulk of the trip was devoted to politicking, and Mr. Obama made no bones about it.
''We have spent the last 20 months governing,'' he said at a luncheon with donors in Austin. ''They spent the last 20 months politicking. Now we've got three months to go, and so we've decided, well, we can politic for three months. They've forgotten I know how to politic pretty good.''
The White House often pairs policy trips with fund-raising events, so the taxpayers can pick up part of the expense, a practice common to past administrations as well. On Monday, Mr. Obama began his day with the Austin fund-raiser, a lunch that raised $1 million for the Democratic National Committee. Of that, $250,000 was to go to the Texas Democratic Party, presumably to help candidates including Mr. White.
The president ended his day in the Dallas suburb of Highland Park at the home of Russell Budd, a prominent plaintiff's lawyer, who hosted a cocktail party that raised $650,000 for the committee that helps elect Senate Democrats.
It is tough to be a Democrat in Texas; Mr. Obama lost this state in 2008 by nearly one million votes. Still, Bill Burton, the deputy White House press secretary, said he saw no broader message in Mr. White's absence.
''I don't think it says anything broadly about the president's coattails,'' Mr. Burton said. ''I think it says that Bill White had something else going on today that he would rather do than campaign with the president.''

HEADLINE: Fed to Buy Debt To Fight Slowing Of the Recovery

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Christine Hauser contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials, acknowledging that their confidence in the recovery had dimmed, moved again on Tuesday to keep interest rates low and encourage economic growth. They also signaled that more aggressive measures could follow if the job market and other indicators continued to weaken.
With short-term interest rates already close to zero, the Fed's policy makers have relatively few tools available to encourage consumer and corporate spending. So they now plan to use the proceeds from the Fed's huge mortgage-bond portfolio to buy long-term government debt.
That action may put downward pressure on long-term interest rates and stimulate borrowing. For consumers, it means mortgage rates are likely to remain at record lows for some time.
Though the immediate impact is likely to be modest, the decision is a turnabout from only a few months ago, when officials were discussing when and how to begin to raise interest rates and gradually shrink the $2.3 trillion balance sheet amassed through the Fed's response to the 2008 financial crisis. 
In buying at least $10 billion a month in new Treasury securities -- a small fraction of the roughly $700 billion in Treasury debt the Fed holds -- the central bank is trying to help keep money readily available in the financial markets.
With Congress seemingly unable to agree on substantial new stimulus spending, the Fed could face a far tougher decision later this year: whether to take more drastic steps to pump money into the economy and make credit even cheaper.
''We're in a lousy middle between the economy picking up on its own and falling off a cliff,'' said Cathy E. Minehan, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. ''And that makes policy-setting really hard.''
The announcement on Tuesday, after the scheduled meeting of the Fed committee that sets interest rates and monetary policy, confirmed what had been widely discussed among economists and business leaders in recent days: the Fed would move more decisively if the economic picture darkened.
The Fed, led by Ben S. Bernanke, its chairman, has shifted away from its more optimistic outlook earlier this year. ''The pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent months,'' said the Federal Open Market Committee. The statement added that the nation's economic recovery was ''likely to be more modest in the near term than had been anticipated.''
Yields on 10-year Treasury securities, a benchmark for home mortgages and corporate loans, tumbled to their lowest level in more than a year on Tuesday. Rates on 30-year Treasuries briefly fell below 4 percent. The yield on a 10-year Treasury note dipped to 2.765 percent from 2.83 before the announcement.
Stocks regained some of their losses from earlier in the day. At its close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 54.5 points, or 0.51 percent, to 10,644.25.
From January 2009 to March 2010, the Fed bought $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion in debt owed by government agencies, primarily the housing finance entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Fed had planned to allow the size of that portfolio to shrink gradually as the securities matured or the debts were prepaid.
Instead, the Fed will now reinvest those principal payments in longer-term Treasury securities. (The central bank said it would continue to roll over its holdings of other Treasury securities as they mature.)
The money involved is unclear. In March, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimated that at least $200 billion of the mortgage-related securities and debt would mature or be prepaid by the end of 2011.
But mortgage rates have dropped since then, giving borrowers an incentive to refinance and pay off existing mortgages, so the actual figure could be substantially larger.
By not allowing its debt holdings to decline below the level of $2.054 trillion at which they stood on Aug. 4, the Fed is preventing what economists have called the passive tightening of monetary policy. The Fed still has the option, if conditions warrant, of increasing its debt purchases.
Some analysts believe that if the economy worsens, the Fed might begin a new round of quantitative easing -- the strategy of buying financial assets to increase the money supply.
In its statement, the committee said that while household spending was gradually increasing, high unemployment, modest income growth, a drop in household wealth and tight credit continued to hamper growth.
The committee said it still expected a ''gradual return'' to normal economic conditions, although the recovery was less robust than expected at this point.
Ethan S. Harris, an economist at Bank of America, said he was ''mildly surprised'' by the Fed's action -- ''not that they did it but rather how quickly they decided.'' He added, ''My expectation had been that the Fed would take a little more time to switch gears and prep the market.''
The decision not to let the balance sheet shrink was a relatively easy one, Mr. Harris added. ''To go back to big asset purchases is a much bigger step, and it would require clear signs that the economy is heading toward a double-dip recession.''
Economists who work in the markets had a mix of reactions.
Bruce McCain, the chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said the Fed ''steered the middle ground.''
''Given the uncertainty, hopefully the middle ground calms nerves and keeps people confident enough to go ahead and spend the money that they have in productive ways,'' he added.
But a former New York Fed economist, John Ryding of RDQ Economics, said the announcement suggested ''a bit of a feeling of panic by the Fed.'' And Joshua Shapiro, an economist at MFR Inc., said the Fed's announcement ''appears to mainly be designed to provide itself with political cover against a backdrop of a gut-wrenching economic correction that shows no sign of ending anytime soon.''
Along with additional quantitative easing, another option available to the Fed is to lower the interest rate (now 0.25 percent) it pays on the roughly $1 trillion in reserves that banks hold at the Fed.
While that action could be helpful, it carries some risk, said Christopher L. House, an economics professor at the University of Michigan.
''If they were to simultaneously lower the rate to zero while leaving $1 trillion in reserves in the banking system, they would have a lot of reason to worry about inflation,'' he said.
In its announcement, the Fed also left unchanged its benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow from one another overnight -- at zero to 0.25 percent, its level since December 2008. And it maintained that the rate would remain ''exceptionally low'' for ''an extended period,'' the language it has been using since March 2009.
The Federal Open Market Committee's vote on Tuesday was 9 to 1. The dissenter was Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
Mr. Hoenig, who is known for his focus on inflation, the Fed's traditional enemy, dissented for the fifth consecutive meeting, both on the extended-period language and on the decision to reinvest the mortgage-bond proceeds.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Senate Race Poses Test for Democrats

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Richard Blumenthal, the longtime Democratic attorney general of Connecticut, has been winning elections handily in the state for nearly two decades and seemed destined for higher office. But the woman who emerged from the Republican Senate primary on Tuesday night, Linda E. McMahon, is unlike any challenger he has faced.
And now the national Democratic Party finds itself with another headache heading into a grueling midterm election season. 
Ms. McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, built a formidable political organization from scratch in 11 months, has bombarded the state with a dozen television advertisements that have made her nearly as visible as the ubiquitous Mr. Blumenthal, and has fired up the perennially underdog Connecticut Republican Party.
Ms. McMahon has promised to make her race against Mr. Blumenthal one of the country's most expensive. She spent $22 million to capture the Republican nomination and is prepared to spend an additional $28 million to win the seat.
And Ms. McMahon will almost certainly wage a personal and potentially nasty campaign that will question Mr. Blumenthal's integrity and take advantage of voter anger to paint him as yet another career politician.
''She has the toughness and temperament needed for the slog of a campaign,'' said Christopher Healy, the executive director of the state's Republican Party. ''She can take a punch. But more important, she can throw one too.''
Ms. McMahon's campaign plans to blanket the state on Wednesday and Thursday with fliers reminding voters of revelations that Mr. Blumenthal had misrepresented his Vietnam War record.
But Mr. Blumenthal and his allies have been preparing for Ms. McMahon. They have collected embarrassing video clips of her more outrageous appearances in the wrestling ring (she kicked her husband in the groin in one skit) and prepared lines of attack that depict her as a corporate executive who amassed a fortune in an industry known for rampant steroid abuse, denigration of women and exploitation of its wrestlers.
Ms. McMahon's formidable candidacy is reverberating far beyond Connecticut's borders, forcing Democratic leaders in Washington to focus attention and perhaps money on defending a seat that had once seemed a sure bet as the party fights to retain control of the Senate.
In January, Mr. Blumenthal entered the race after Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a fellow Democrat, announced his retirement amid signs that his re-election would be in serious jeopardy. Mr. Blumenthal, 63, was quickly embraced by Democratic leaders, who hoped his popularity and sterling reputation would help the party hold the seat.
But Mr. Blumenthal's credibility suffered a blow in May after reports surfaced that he had incorrectly said in front of various groups that he had served in Vietnam. He served in the Marine Corps Reserve but did not go to Vietnam.
Now, 12 weeks before Election Day, the outlines of the messages that Mr. Blumenthal and Ms. McMahon plan to use are becoming clear. Both sides intend to reflect the anti-establishment mood among voters at a time of economic uncertainty.
On Wednesday, Mr. Blumenthal's campaign plans to begin broadcasting a statewide television advertisement in which Mr. Blumenthal deplores the absence of anyone in Washington willing to take on special interests.
Beyond that, Mr. Blumenthal, a hard-charging prosecutor, will present himself as a familiar and dependable figure who has spent 20 years protecting the interests of Connecticut voters, by taking on polluters, tobacco companies and unscrupulous drug manufacturers.
His campaign and its surrogates will also seek to contrast Mr. Blumenthal's achievements in office with Ms. McMahon's role at the W.W.E., implying that it would be unwise to trust a woman who had placed profits ahead of the public good.
Eric Schultz, a strategist for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is working closely with the Blumenthal campaign, said the election would come down to a choice between ''a corporate C.E.O. who looked out for herself and a crusading attorney general'' who has looked out for voters.
Ms. McMahon, Mr. Schultz added, made ''millions running the W.W.E., where she peddled violent, sexually explicit material to kids, used lobbyists to grow her profits and embraced widespread steroid abuse.''
Ms. McMahon, who describes herself as a fiscal conservative, will offer, of course, a starkly different view of her stewardship of the W.W.E., saying her work gave her practical skills and experience that are sorely lacking in Washington but are needed to turn the country around.
Her campaign will also highlight a bankruptcy 20 years ago that cost her family its home, suggesting that she knows firsthand the economic hardship many people are facing. At the same time, the campaign will seek to portray Mr. Blumenthal as untruthful and remind voters about his Vietnam War record.
''The argument we have to make is that Blumenthal is not who you think he is, that he is not who he says he is,'' said a McMahon adviser who asked to remain anonymous to discuss campaign strategy.
But in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans, Ms. McMahon will have her work cut out for her.
Ms. McMahon's advisers say that beyond rallying Republicans, she will strive to win a majority of the state's crucial independent voters and a smaller fraction of disaffected Democrats.
In the end, money will play a significant role in one of the most expensive media markets in the country. Mr. Blumenthal has about $2.1 million in his campaign treasury, far less than Ms. McMahon has at her disposal.
A big question for the national Democratic Party will be whether to pump money into Mr. Blumenthal's race. It is a difficult call in a year when Democrats are stretched thin trying to protect seats throughout the country.
For now, the national party says it is monitoring the race in Connecticut but has not committed to spending money on behalf of Mr. Blumenthal.
But one national Democratic strategist, who spoke anonymously because he did not want to antagonize his colleagues, said it would be an ominous sign if the party had to invest significantly in the Connecticut race.
''If the party is forced to pour money into Connecticut,'' the strategist said, ''then that means it will have less money to spend on other races that it needs to be competitive in. And that is a big problem.''

HEADLINE: How to Achieve Workplace Equality

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''A Market Punishing to Mothers,'' by David Leonhardt (Economic Scene column, Aug. 4), offers an excellent analysis of the challenges facing mothers in the job market. The solution lies in changing the behavior of fathers.
When fathers behave more like mothers, curtailing their work commitments to care for children, two things will happen. Mothers will be able to curtail their own commitments, allowing them to maintain a stronger hold in the job market. And as the behavior of fathers and mothers becomes indistinguishable, women will no longer be punished disproportionately by the market for having children. 
Once this occurs, parents, united, will be able to push for changes in the organization of the workplace.
Women's lives have already been transformed in revolutionary ways. It is time to turn our attention to men's lives and complete the revolution.
Claire F. Ullman New York, Aug. 4, 2010
The writer is an adjunct assistant professor of political science at Columbia University and Barnard College.
To the Editor:
David Leonhardt's column is well intentioned, but some of his conclusions run counter to Catalyst research findings.
Our report, ''Pipeline's Broken Promise,'' surveyed more than 4,000 M.B.A. alumni from 26 prestigious universities worldwide. We found that women lagged behind men from their first post-M.B.A. job -- in responsibilities, potential for advancement and pay -- and never caught up.
This held true regardless of previous work experience, industry, geography and parenthood status. Furthermore, men who stepped off the traditional career track didn't take a position or pay hit when they returned, but women did.
Sexism remains entrenched in hiring practices, promotions and pay scales. Gender -- not motherhood -- is the biggest determinant of career success. Yes, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Harriet Miers are childless. But so was former Justice David H. Souter.
Mr. Leonhardt refers to the ''disproportionate number of prominent women who do not have children.'' There are currently 14 female Fortune 500 chief executives. At least 11 of the 14 have children. All are ''prominent women.''
Ilene H. Lang New York, Aug. 4, 2010
The writer is president and chief executive of Catalyst, a nonprofit organization that works to expand opportunities for women and business.
To the Editor:
David Leonhardt does a wonderful job summarizing the hits many women take in the workplace. Yet, strangely, he notes that ''this problem isn't one that lends itself to a sweeping policy solution.''
In fact, policy is our best hope for lowering the hurdles faced by primary caregivers -- whether male or female. As Mr. Leonhardt himself goes on to explain, paid parental leave, universal preschool programs and flexible work options can help equalize the playing field -- as they already do in many other countries.
To his list of critical improvements, I would add greater access to affordable, high-quality child care.
Sharon Lerner Brooklyn, Aug. 4, 2010
The writer is the author of ''The War on Moms: On Life in a Family-Unfriendly Nation.''
To the Editor:
As David Leonhardt's article points out, the corporate ladder model of career progression and development does not fit the majority of women's lives. And it increasingly doesn't fit men's lives either.
Baby boomers nearing retirement want more options besides the ''all or nothing'' choice of retiring or working full time. Husbands in dual-career households report greater dissatisfaction with career-life fit than women. Generation X fathers are much more involved at home than their fathers were and are struggling with competing responsibilities. Generation Y sees linear and lockstep workplaces and thinks ''stifling work environment.''
The reality is that the corporate ladder paradigm has outlived its useful, century-old life and no longer represents how today's careers are really built or how so much of today's work gets done.
It's time to adopt a corporate lattice mind-set -- one that acknowledges and adapts to the fact that the world of work has changed for both the individual and the organization. Careers zig and zag. Work is done whenever and wherever. And information flows in every which way.
Organizations that recognize this reality will attract the top talent needed to compete in today's competitive marketplace. Those who ignore this changing world of work -- and the new career paradigm it demands -- will surely fall behind.

HEADLINE: Study Looks At a Lapse Of Tax Cuts For the Rich

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As debate heats up over President Obama's proposal to let the Bush tax cuts expire for the wealthy but to extend them for everyone else, a nonpartisan Congressional analysis circulated on Capitol Hill on Tuesday provides a look at the impact the plan would have on high-income taxpayers.
Given the progressive nature of the federal income tax system, in which tax rates increase with income, even the richest households would continue to pay the four lower rates on up to the first $250,000 of their income, under the approach being pushed by Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress. 
The president has vowed to extend the tax cuts for individuals with less than $200,000 in annual taxable income and couples with less than $250,000 -- about 98 percent of American households. About 315,000 households report adjusted gross income of $1 million or more.
Taxpayers with income of more than $1 million for 2011 would still receive on average a tax cut of about $6,300 compared with what they would have paid under rates in effect until 2001, according to the analysis, which was prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation at the request of the Democratic majority on the House Ways and Means Committee.
That compares, however, with the roughly $100,000 average tax cut that households with more than $1 million in income would receive under current rates.
Filers with taxable income of $500,000 to $1 million would still get on average a tax cut of $6,700 compared with pre-2001 rates, according to the data from the tax analysts. But that compares with roughly $17,500 if the top Bush tax rates were maintained.
If the president gets his way, in 2011 the top two income tax rates -- now 33 percent and 35 percent -- would revert to the levels before the Bush administration, 36 percent and 39.6 percent, respectively. But the four lower rates would remain 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent and 28 percent. For some taxpayers earning up to $250,000, the top marginal rate would remain 33 percent.
The tax-cut debate is shaping up as one of the hottest of the year and will play out in the weeks before voters go to the polls to determine which party controls Congress. Democrats want to extend the tax cuts for all but the wealthy, while Republicans are fighting to maintain them for everyone.
Most of the tax cuts that were a signature domestic initiative of George W. Bush's presidency carried an expiration date of Dec. 31, 2010, to limit the potential revenue losses; supporters assumed that they would be extended when the time came.
Extending them for the next 10 years would add about $3.8 trillion to a growing national debt that is already the largest since World War II. About $700 billion of that reflects the projected costs of tax cuts for those in the top 2 percent of income-earners.
With the economy still weak, the issue of the tax cuts has led to an economic debate between those who would end all or some of them to reduce the projected debt and those who say raising taxes on the wealthy could threaten the economic recovery.
For both parties, the dispute has become a defining one as they hone campaign arguments heading toward November.
Speaking of Republicans at a fund-raiser in a wealthy community near Dallas on Monday, Mr. Obama told Democratic donors, ''What you see is a governing philosophy on their part that basically comes down to 'We're going to extend tax cuts for the wealthiest among us' -- folks who don't need those tax cuts and weren't even asking for them, which would cost $700 billion.''
For their part, Republicans do not emphasize the impact of extending the tax cuts for wealthy individuals. Rather, they say Mr. Obama is about to spring a big tax increase on many small-business owners who file their taxes as individuals. Analyses from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research organization, show that less than 3 percent of filers with small-business income pay at the top two income tax rates, and many of those are doctors and lawyers in partnerships.

HEADLINE: South Carolina Quietly Takes A Share of Stimulus Money

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
Early last year, while still a rising G.O.P. star, Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina led a chorus of Republican governors criticizing the federal stimulus package and vowing to reject at least some of the money being directed to their states. 
The governors focused their ire, in particular, on provisions that pushed states to expand jobless benefits to some previously ineligible workers, like those seeking only part-time work or people new to the work force. They argued that the changes would lead to tax increases.
Two months ago, however, with the bright lights of political promise dimmed by a scandal involving an extramarital affair, Mr. Sanford quietly signed a bill passed by the Legislature that expanded eligibility for unemployment benefits. The move paved the way for the state to claim $97.5 million in stimulus money to bolster its financially ailing unemployment insurance trust fund.
The federal Department of Labor announced Tuesday that South Carolina had officially cleared its approval process and that the stimulus money was being released immediately.
The reversal by Mr. Sanford attracted virtually no notice, but it made South Carolina the 33rd state in the country to expand jobless benefits to qualify for its full share of stimulus money under the program, according to the National Employment Law Project, a liberal advocacy group.
Mr. Sanford joined several other governors who had initially expressed hesitation about the money but later relented, including Dave Heineman of Nebraska and Sonny Perdue of Georgia, both Republicans, and Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat.
In South Carolina, the expansion of jobless benefits was part of a broader measure to overhaul the handling of the state's unemployment insurance trust fund, which is nearly $1 billion in the red.
The eligibility changes, which also cover workers forced to leave a job because of an illness in the family or because a spouse moved, take effect in 2011.

HEADLINE: House Passes Bill to Aid States and Public Schools

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House interrupted its summer recess on Tuesday to approve $26 billion in aid to school districts and states to prevent large-scale layoffs of teachers and public employees and to engage in another partisan fight over policy priorities.
After the vote of 247 to 161 in favor of the legislation, President Obama quickly signed the measure at the White House, underscoring the importance Democrats place on the bill that they view as compelling evidence of their commitment to protecting American jobs. 
''We can't stand by and do nothing while pink slips are given to the men and women who educate our children or keep our communities safe,'' Mr. Obama said earlier in the day, exhorting the House to send him the measure. ''That doesn't make sense.''
The Senate broke an impasse over the $26 billion measure last week and sent it to the House, which was called back into session by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to approve the bill.
Its backers said the measure would allow tens of thousands of public school teachers, government employees and emergency workers to keep working and help distressed states provide health care to the poor.
''I don't understand how anyone, Democrat or Republican, can be against keeping teachers in the classroom, keeping cops on the beat and keeping firefighters protecting our homes,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader.
Just two Republicans crossed party lines to support the measure; three Democrats opposed it.
Leading Republicans harshly rejected the bill, saying it was just the latest case of overspending by Democrats. They characterized the legislation as another in a string of bailouts that would not create new jobs. They also said Congress was coming to the rescue of states that had mishandled their own finances.
''We are broke,'' Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, said about the federal government. ''We do not have the money to bail out the states. It's time for them to get their arms around their problems and not look to Washington to bail them out.''
As they convened to take up the state aid bill, House members also by voice vote approved $600 million in new spending for border enforcement that had been approved by the Senate last week. But because of a jurisdictional issue, the measure must be approved one more time by the Senate before it can be sent to the White House.
Senate leaders were exploring whether they could act before the end of the week and get the measure to the president's desk.
On the aid package, Democrats noted that the $26 billion cost of the measure would not be added to the deficit, but would be offset by revising a corporate tax provision that affects companies that do businesses overseas as well as by making future cuts in food-stamp spending.
Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, had been pressing for months to allocate the money, which he said was needed because state and local budgets had still not recovered from the recession.
''We do the country no favors if we allow the weakness of the economy to strip qualified teachers from our schools, which in turn would result in exploding class sizes and a decline in educational opportunities for children,'' Mr. Obey said.
In its haste to pass the measure last week, the Senate failed to fill in the title of the measure, leading to Republican ridicule.
''In its mad rush, the Senate passed the 'blank' act of 'blank,' '' said Representative David Dreier of California, the senior Republican on the Rules Committee. ''God only knows what other mistakes have been made here.''
Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, said of the decision to call back the House: ''This is a national emergency. Apparently Congress has not spent enough money.''
Republicans also said that Congress would not have needed to consider the measure if Democrats had not failed to take up regular spending bills, forcing Congress to work on problems in a piecemeal basis. And they called it a favor for members of teachers' unions who are allied with Democrats.
''It will make the teachers unions happy,'' said Representative John Kline, Republican of Minnesota, ''but it won't make teaching in schools better.''
Illustrating the political implications of the vote, Americans for Limited Government, a conservative group, quickly issued statements attacking Democrats considered vulnerable in November for their votes on the measure. But education and health groups joined the National Governors Association in applauding the House vote.
Democrats say they believe the outcome weighs in their favor politically, and the fact that all but three Democrats voted for it showed the confidence that lawmakers had in the measure. Democrats said it would allow them to court teachers and emergency workers while emphasizing the contrast with Congressional Republicans who opposed the package.
''There could not be a better example of the differences in priorities between Republicans and Democrats than this legislation,'' said Tim Kaine, the head of the Democratic National Committee.

HEADLINE: Upset in Democratic Primary for Connecticut Governor

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ; Reporting was contributed by Robert Davey, Elizabeth Maker, Daniel E. Slotnik and Tim Stelloh.

 BODY:
Republican and Democratic voters in Connecticut nominated their party's candidates for governor and United States Senate on Tuesday, setting the stage for expensive and highly competitive general election contests that will make the state the focus of national attention heading into the midterm elections.
In an upset, Dannel P. Malloy, a former mayor of Stamford, the state's fourth-largest city, won the Democratic nomination for governor, defeating Ned Lamont, a multimillionaire businessman who spent nearly $9 million of his own money four years after failing in a bid for the United States Senate.
Mr. Malloy's victory sets up a contest with Thomas C. Foley, a prominent Republican fund-raiser and former ambassador under President George W. Bush. Mr. Foley defeated Lt. Gov. Michael C. Fedele for the Republican nomination. Republicans have held the governor's office in Connecticut since 1995.
In a victory speech at a restaurant in Hartford, Mr. Malloy vowed to wage a vigorous battle in the fall. ''This campaign will be fought on the Main Streets across this state,'' he told supporters. 
With 90 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Malloy had 58 percent and Mr. Lamont 42 percent.
Mr. Malloy and Mr. Foley will be battling to replace Gov. M. Jodi Rell, a Republican who came into office six years ago under extraordinary circumstances, replacing Gov. John G. Rowland, who went to prison after pleading guilty to corruption charges. Mrs. Rell, who was lieutenant governor under Mr. Rowland, was elected on her own in 2006.
In a race with national ramifications, Linda E. McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, captured the Republican nomination for the United States Senate seat that Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat, has held for about three decades.
Ms. McMahon, who has tapped her personal fortune to mount a hard-charging campaign, will face Richard Blumenthal, the state's popular five-term attorney general, in a general election that may have a significant impact on the balance of political power in Washington.
''People ask me every day why I'm running,'' Ms. McMahon said at a hotel in Cromwell. ''Because I have a great fear the American dream is in great jeopardy, and I don't want to lose that dream for our children and our grandchildren.''
Mr. Blumenthal predicted a tough campaign ahead. ''There are clear choices ahead and a great deal at stake,'' he said in a statement. ''Washington isn't working, and the people of Connecticut want to know what we're going to do to stand up to the special interests and put their interests first.''
The match-up between Ms. McMahon and Mr. Blumenthal is on a pace to be among the most expensive and nastiest Senate contests in the country, with Ms. McMahon prepared to spend an additional $30 million or so of her own money. Both are expected to flood the airwaves with ads leveling sharp attacks on their opponent's integrity.
Democratic leaders, who are locked in a battle to retain their majority in the United States Senate, had once thought the party would have little trouble holding onto the seat in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans.
But polls suggest that the race has tightened as Mr. Blumenthal's once strong standing has been undermined by revelations that he had misrepresented his service during the Vietnam War. Ms. McMahon is expected to hammer away at that in the coming weeks to question Mr. Blumenthal's trustworthiness.
So Democratic leaders are now confronted with a potentially expensive and distracting race at a time when they need to defend incumbent Democrats in states around the country.
With 90 percent of the vote counted, Ms. McMahon had 49 percent of the vote, while Rob Simmons, a former congressman who had dropped out of the race only to re-enter it last month, had 28 percent, and Peter Schiff, a financier, had 23 percent.
In the Democratic primary in the governor's race, Mr. Malloy, who received the party's endorsement, overcame the vast personal fortune invested in the race by Mr. Lamont, the founder of a telecommunications company.
Mr. Malloy came close to being the Democratic Party candidate for governor in 2006. But this time, he had several factors working in his favor, including sagging support among liberals for Mr. Lamont, who campaigned against the Iraq war in 2006 in his bid against Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. Mr. Lamont positioned himself as a centrist in his bid to become governor.
Before supporters at a restaurant in Bridgeport, Mr. Lamont conceded defeat. ''He won,'' he said. ''And we're going to do everything to unite behind the Democratic ticket and go forward to November. We're looking forward, not back.''
On the Republican side, Mr. Foley, who was ambassador to Ireland under Mr. Bush, prevailed, though Mr. Fedele had in the final weeks of the race begun narrowing the lead Mr. Foley enjoyed.
The primaries for governor in both parties pitted established politicians against wealthy candidates who spent millions of dollars of their own money on their campaigns. As the races entered the final weeks, a nasty tone seemed to turn off many voters.
Kathleen Barrett, a 67-year-old Democrat from Bridgeport, expressed disappointment with the ugliness of the campaigns as she showed up at the Black Rock School in Bridgeport to cast her vote. ''I didn't want to know what your opponent did wrong,'' she said. ''I want to know what you're going to do when you get there.''
For all the voter displeasure with the negative campaigns, the lines of attack employed in the primary are likely to be recycled in the general election race.
Mr. Lamont accused Mr. Malloy of awarding contracts as mayor of Stamford to companies that helped him raise money or that undertook renovations on his home, even though a 2005 state investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing.
Mr. Malloy, in turn, sought to knock down a pillar of Mr. Lamont's campaign: that his success as a businessman gave him the credentials to be the state's chief executive. Mr. Malloy noted that Mr. Lamont cut 70 percent of his work force at his company, Lamont Digital Systems, several years ago.
While Mr. Lamont had his personal wealth to draw from, Mr. Malloy had to rely on $2.5 million he received through the state's public-finance program.
The Republican primary was no less brutal. Throughout the race, Mr. Fedele mocked Mr. Foley's record as a businessman, even as Mr. Foley made the case that that record gave him the experience needed to run the state in tough economic times. Mr. Foley, who captured the state party's endorsement in May, shot back, questioning Mr. Fedele's suitability to run the state by pointing out that the government had amassed a multibillion-dollar deficit during his tenure as Mrs. Rell's lieutenant governor.
Like Mr. Lamont, Mr. Foley relied on his own money, funneling $3 million into his campaign, on top of the nearly $800,000 he has raised; Mr. Fedele was limited to the $2.5 million the public-finance program provided him.
At a hotel in Rocky Hill, Mr. Foley said, ''I can already see the choice voters will have in the fall: reform or more of the same.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 13, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in some editions on Wednesday about the Connecticut primary election results misstated the history of the Republican Party's control of the governor's office. A Republican has held the office every year since 1995, not since 1991. (Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who had been a Republican congressman, was elected governor as an independent and served from 1991 to 1995.)

HEADLINE: BRIDGING EAST AND WEST

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- When reports began circulating last week that a Chinese investor was bidding to take over the Liverpool soccer club in the English Premier League, British tabloids quickly called him King Kenny.
That little-known investor is Kenny Huang, 46, a globe-trotting sports enthusiast who has made marketing deals in China with the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Yankees, and has entered into a business partnership with Leslie Alexander, the owner of the Houston Rockets.
In February, he helped the Yankees tour China with their World Series trophy, trying to drum up interest in Major League Baseball. He also advised Chinese investors bidding to acquire a 15 percent stake in the Cavaliers, although the deal did not work out. And in an interview this year, he said that he would consider acquiring an N.F.L. team.
''If there's an opportunity, we'll do it, but only for the learning process,'' Huang said during the interview in Shanghai in March. ''The N.F.L. is the most profitable league. The management, the intellectual property, the ownership structure is the best.'' 
Friends say Huang made a fortune working on Wall Street and helping clients invest in Chinese initial public stock offerings. Now, they say, he is pushing China to overhaul its sports system and develop its own professional sports leagues with corporate sponsors -- a challenge in a country where the government retains tight control of sports programs.
But his interests are not confined to China. In what could be one of the biggest sports club deals in history, Huang is said to be considering acquiring the Liverpool club from its owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett of the United States, who bought the team in 2007. The English Premier League is the wealthiest soccer league in the world.
Such a takeover -- which Huang hinted at in a news release last week -- could cost as much as $600 million, analysts say, including the assumption of debt.
Liverpool said last week that there were six bidders for the club but declined further comment. Investors from India and the Middle East are reportedly among those who have shown interest.
The planned bidding for Liverpool underscores the growing interest of foreign buyers in professional sports teams in Europe and the United States. The Manchester City soccer club in England, for example, is owned by the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi, and in New Jersey, the Nets are controlled by the Russian billionaire Mikhail D. Prokhorov.
Huang, a Chinese-born United States citizen, declined to be interviewed about the potential Liverpool bid. The Times of London wrote last week that China's sovereign wealth fund was financing the bid. But a spokesman for that fund, China Investment Corp., told The Financial Times that the story was preposterous.
That leaves the spotlight on Huang, who colleagues say has close ties to the Chinese government but also deep-pocketed admirers in the United States.
''Kenny's a very talented guy, and he's very knowledgeable about sports,'' said Red McCombs, a former owner of the Denver Nuggets and the San Antonio Spurs, and an occasional investor with Huang in China. ''He's a unique dealmaker. I'll bet on him any day.''
His background, though, is as complex as it is impressive. In the interview in March, Huang -- whose Chinese name is Huang Jianhua -- said that he grew up in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou and that as a 9-year-old, he entered a state-run sports school as a badminton player.
Later, he said, he studied Japanese at Zhongshan University in Guangzhou and then in 1985 moved to New York, where he earned a master's degree at St. John's and took courses at Columbia University and New York University. He is married with two children, he said.
He also spent several years in the 1980s and early 1990s at the New York Stock Exchange working with Asian stock listings, he said. Then he found more lucrative work.
''After '91, the Japanese economy collapsed,'' Huang recalled of his time at the stock exchange, saying his Japanese was excellent. ''The billionaires were in trouble. They said, 'Why don't you quit and become our personal investment adviser?' I was helping them buy and sell assets.''
Court records in the United States show he lived in New York and southern Florida and in the 1990s formed a series of small companies, including one that sold ''Chinese-made novelty products.'' It eventually went out of business.
The Web site of another company he helped form, Aspen Infrastructure Investment, lists one of the partners as George Lindemann, whom Forbes magazine ranks as one of the world's richest men. Lindemann could not be reached for comment this week.
(Huang was sued by one of his former United States partners in a dispute over $2.9 million, but earlier this year, a Florida jury ruled in his favor.)
About eight years ago, he met the consultant Marc Ganis, now his partner at SportsCorp China, a sports business firm.
Ganis said that years ago, Huang brought Chinese officials planning the Beijing Olympics to visit sports facilities in the United States. He said Huang's business and government ties and his knowledge of how to create successful deals in China allowed him to create breakthrough sports initiatives in the country.
''I've introduced Kenny to some of the most important people in the sports industry in the U.S.,'' Ganis said. ''And they immediately recognize that as China develops, he's going to be able to grow with it. He has a unique ability to bridge East and West.''
One of his ventures is Rocket Capital, formed with Alexander of the Rockets. The venture and others have invested more than $200 million in Chinese I.P.O.'s in Hong Kong over the past five years, according to securities filings.
Huang has also worked on sponsorship deals in China with the Rockets, the Cavaliers and the Yankees. Just last week, his company QSL Sports said that a Chinese company had signed a four-year sponsorship deal with the Yankees in the instant noodle sector.
Now, Huang said, he is working to duplicate Little League baseball and other youth sports leagues in China. He has already invested in a professional baseball league and a pro basketball league, the National Basketball League, which he intends to revamp so that it can compete with the much bigger and more heavily financed Chinese Basketball Association.
Analysts say the Chinese have a growing interest in professional sports teams in the United States and Europe. Nike and Adidas are investing heavily in expansion here, and China's own sports brands, like Li Ning and Anta (which Huang invested in and which recently signed Kevin Garnett of the Boston Celtics basketball team to a sneaker deal) are also thriving.
''I've seen the changes in the post-Olympic period,'' Huang said in the interview as he lounged on a sofa at the Westin Hotel in Shanghai, dressed in a track suit. ''You now have the opportunity to invest in sports. The government wants sports to become an industry.''
For Huang, the change in Chinese government policy is drastically altering the sports industry here, opening new opportunities for sports clubs and marketers. And that is one reason the Yankees are also looking to Huang.
''He's our man in China and he was incredibly important in creating our connections with the Chinese Baseball League and getting our first Chinese sponsor,'' said Randy Levine, the president of the Yankees. ''Basically, he makes sure that the Yankee brand is known in China and he brings sponsorship opportunities to us.''

HEADLINE: Government Figures Show a Cooling Chinese Economy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- In the latest signs that the Chinese economy is beginning to cool after setting a torrid pace in the first half of this year, several government indicators slowed slightly last month, Beijing announced Wednesday morning.
The July indicators, for industrial output, retail sales, fixed asset investment and bank lending, all provided a fairly consistent snapshot of a country where economic growth remains the strongest in the world, but where the nearly manic spending of the last few months is starting to fade.
A gradual slackening in retail sales and fixed asset investment last month, together with a weakening of imports that was announced on Tuesday, pointed to more caution by consumers and investors alike in China. Exports continue to surge, creating the prospect that China may once again rely on foreign buyers to sustain rapid economic growth and limit unemployment. 
The moderation in China's economic growth is no accident. A series of government policies, as varied as limits on bank loans and restrictions on real estate investments, have been aimed at preventing the economy from overheating, which could fan inflation.
But an imbalance in China between strong exports and weakening domestic demand could rekindle trade tensions with industrialized and developing countries alike, economists said. Unemployment remains a problem in many other countries, not just the United States, that find themselves buying ever more from China.
Particularly unexpected in the data on Wednesday morning was the restraint that Chinese banks showed in issuing new loans, which in turn contributed to slower growth in the money supply. Banks issued 533 billion renminbi ($78.7 billion) in new loans last month, down from 603.4 billion renminbi ($89.1 billion) in June.
A broad measure of money supply, M2, rose 17.6 percent in July compared with a year earlier after being up 18.5 percent in June.
''We believe this level of broad money supply growth is clearly too restrictive, as it will put more downward pressure on domestic demand growth in the near future,'' said two Goldman Sachs economists, Yu Song and Helen Qiao, in a research note.
The gradual slowing in China is evident in the factories that have turned the country into the manufacturing center of the world. Industrial output rose 13.4 percent last month compared with the same month last year.
By comparison, industrial output had been up 13.7 percent in June from a year earlier, and was up 16.5 percent as recently as May.
Much the same pattern was evident in fixed asset investment, which was up 24.9 percent last month compared with a year earlier. It had been ahead by 25.5 percent in June, and 25.9 percent in May.
Retail sales rose 17.9 percent in July compared with the same month last year, as Chinese consumers with rising wages continued to flock to stores for ever more spending. But sales had grown 18.3 percent in June compared with a year earlier, and had been up 18.7 percent in May.
Chinese policy makers have long feared that inflation could lead to social unrest, and have tailored many policies to prevent it. Consumer prices were up 3.3 percent in July from a year earlier, accelerating from an increase of 2.9 percent in June.
But there were signs that future inflation could begin to moderate. Producer prices were 4.8 percent higher in July than a year ago, after being up 6.4 percent in June and 7.1 percent in May.
Many businesses are still complaining about rising costs, which may hurt their willingness to invest. Alex Yu, a senior manager at the Dongguan Jet Power Metals and Plastics Factory in Dongguan, China, said that workers' wages had climbed 20 to 30 percent in the last year while the cost of an indispensable kind of raw plastic had soared 23 percent.
''Everything is getting more and more expensive, we feel the impact of inflation in all areas of our business,'' he said.
On Tuesday, China's General Administration of Customs announced that the country's trade surplus reached $28.7 billion last month, the highest level since January of last year, as exports surged and while the growth in imports dwindled.
The official China Daily newspaper said in an editorial on Wednesday that the surplus showed the resilience of China's exporters but was not a reason to let the renminbi rise more quickly in value against other currencies.
The surplus ''is not a reason to tout faster appreciation of the Chinese currency as a panacea,'' the editorial said. ''The real solution to China's swelling trade surplus must include long-term reforms to enrich Chinese consumers and boost their consumption levels.''
But Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who has repeatedly called for a more confrontational trade strategy toward China, said in a statement late Tuesday that China's latest trade numbers ''show just how little motive China has to end its currency manipulation unless it is pushed to do so.''

HEADLINE: In Signs of New Life, Property Deals Below As a Park Runs Above

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
When construction loans grew scarce two years ago, property development along Manhattan's High Line, which had been fast and fierce, stumbled. One prominent project that still seemed to be moving along was a new branch of the Whitney Museum of American Art at the southern tip of the elevated park.
While planning for that six-story museum at Washington and Gansevoort Streets is well under way, there are also signs that other development is picking up in this real estate submarket viewed as robust relative to some other Manhattan neighborhoods.
The first part of the High Line, a landscaped city park created on abandoned elevated rail tracks that eventually is to stretch from Gansevoort Street to 34th Street, opened in June 2009, running north from Gansevoort to 20th Street. The second of three segments is expected to open in spring of 2011 and extend the High Line to 30th Street. 
Now, among the dozens of projects planned along the length of the High Line, some have changed hands and a few were sold by banks after developers defaulted, but most are still on track for development. Some developers are waiting for construction loans to become available, and other longtime property owners are just waiting for the right moment to move forward, but all agree that a submarket has been created, the strength of which could not have been envisioned just five years ago.
Real estate owners along the first High Line segment, a large chunk of which spans the meatpacking district, said they were already starting to feel the park's positive effects on real estate values.
''For those who thought that area was a flash in the pan, something that already happened, they're going to be pleasantly surprised with the next dimensions of the change in that neighborhood,'' said Joseph J. Sitt, the chief executive of Thor Equities, a real estate development company that owns 446 West 14th Street, which connects directly to the High Line.
Mr. Sitt said Thor was rebuilding 446 West 14th Street and would install a women's clothing boutique, called Kritzia, by the fall, as well as a restaurant and a club lounge with a possible rooftop space by the spring of 2011.
Hampshire Real Estate Companies of Morristown, N.J., has owned a warehouse at 259 10th Avenue between 25th and 26th Streets for many years. The company is prepared to overhaul the interior of the hulking structure, which was designed by the architect Cass Gilbert, but is waiting for the right tenant.
''It couldn't be better located,'' said A. Eugene Kohn, chairman of Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, the architecture firm hired to retrofit the building.
Other longtime property owners were poised to develop when the recession hit. Edison Properties of Newark had planned two towers with 869 condominium apartments on a block west of the High Line between 17th and 18th Streets. The land is still a parking lot.
Now, Edison executives are biding their time as they prepare to clean up the soil on the property, which they have owned more than 20 years. Edison will also assist the city in creating a public park east of the High Line to 10th Avenue between 17th and 18th Streets, ''like the Spanish Steps'' in Rome, said Ken Miller, an Edison executive vice president.
Developers who have owned their properties for less time, perhaps even those that bought at the top of the boom, may not have the luxury of waiting out the market. Citibank has been trying to sell a slightly cantilevered shiny metal-skinned condominium building at 245 10th Avenue and 25th Street, said Erik Ekstein, the owner of Ekstein Development, who said he was asked if he wanted to take over the project. He declined.
Mr. Ekstein is developing a 91-unit condominium building at 540 West 28th Street and a 30-unit rental building at 537 West 27th Street, midway between the High Line and 11th Avenue, along with L&M Development Partners, a firm based in Westchester County that typically develops low- and moderate-priced housing.
The projects will not be built as affordable housing, because two years ago, L&M couldn't buy enough development rights from landowners immediately beneath the High Line to make moderate-priced units feasible, said Ron Moelis, a principal with L&M.
''People were valuing those development rights so high, they priced themselves out of the market,'' Mr. Moelis said. Since the economic downturn, ''there are maybe some people who need some money or liquidity, so more development rights have come on the market the past year or so,'' a boon to property developers.
Some developers have been able to exploit distressed situations. Equity Residential of Chicago announced at an earnings meeting earlier this year that it was leasing a parcel at 23rd Street and 10th Avenue, where the previous developer had poured a foundation before running into financial trouble. Equity plans to build 111 apartments and 9,400 square feet of retail space, and construction has already started.
Another parcel at 500 West 21st Street and 10th Avenue changed hands in May after its owners group, including the developers Charles Blaichman and Andre Balazs, defaulted on the loan.
Sherwood Equities, a real estate development and investment firm based in New York, picked up the property, which has a 19,000-square-foot garage on it, for a fraction of the $50 million the original owners paid in 2007, said Ryan Nelson, a Sherwood senior vice president.
In July, Sherwood leased the site to a garage operator. Later, when construction financing and loans for homebuyers become easier to obtain, the development company could build 100,000 square feet of residential, hotel, office or retail space, said Jeffrey Katz, Sherwood's chief executive.
''Right now, there's still difficulties to developing in New York,'' he said. ''The market's not exactly robust.''
A hotel planned for 511 West 21st Street, abutting the High Line, with backers who included Mr. Blaichman and the rap musician Jay-Z, has been reported to be another casualty of the economic downtown.
Another property on the market is 508 West 20th Street, which abuts the High Line on the west side. No buyer has yet stepped up to pay the $9 million asking price for the 3,800-square-foot lot, a broker at Zohar Properties said.
At the height of the market, the price of properties next to the High Line may have soared as high as $400 a buildable square foot, but current prices are roughly $200 a buildable square foot, said Paul Pariser, a co-chief executive of a commercial property owner, Taconic Investment Partners, based in New York.
In 2008, Taconic, along with the Related Companies, one of the city's most prolific developers, opened the first condominium building with access to the High Line. Now, Taconic has almost completed 15 Little West 12th Street, an 80,000-square-foot office building with retail space east of the High Line.
Taconic is also poised to develop another office building at 837 Washington Street at 13th Street, also east of the High Line.
''The High Line has been a very positive influence to push activities to Washington, which was sort of a back street, but now it's become very prime,'' Mr. Pariser said.
Mr. Pariser said a new office building, the High Line Building at 450 West 14th Street, which is still being completed, has been quickly attracting tenants.
A gas station at the corner of 10th Avenue and 14th Street, abutting the High Line, is available for lease, said Karen Bellantoni, an executive vice president with Robert K. Futterman & Associates, a retail real estate brokerage firm.
She said that future development along the High Line north of 18th Street would be mostly residential.
''My understanding is that there are a few things in play, but right now, everyone's sort of waiting to see,'' Ms. Bellantoni said.
The Related Companies -- which also won the contract to develop the Hudson Yards area -- has, as yet, no timeline for development of lots it has assembled both east and west of the High Line from 29th to 30th Streets, which eventually could become residential, hotel, office, retail or a mix of the four, said Bruce Beal Jr., an executive vice president with Related.
''The development of the High Line so far has created a very strong submarket,'' Mr. Beal said.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about new development along the High Line in Manhattan misstated the status of an apartment building at 23rd Street and 10th Avenue planned by Equity Residential. Construction has already started; it is not the case that it will begin this year.

HEADLINE: In Reversal, Productivity Decreased For Quarter

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Business productivity fell for the first time in 18 months in the second quarter and labor costs were flat, according to government data released Tuesday. 
Productivity declined by an annual rate of 0.9 percent after rising at a revised 3.9 percent rate in the first quarter, a Labor Department report showed on Tuesday. Falling output per worker implies the economy is operating less efficiently because overall production is below its potential.
It was the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008 that output per worker declined.
Other data showed consumers growing increasingly gloomy about the economic outlook while business inventories increased and sales slumped.
A potential silver lining in the productivity report was the possibility that it might soon force more hiring by employers who might have reached the limits of squeezing current work forces.
''If working people longer and harder is no longer bringing large returns to businesses, executives may have to find other ways to expand production,'' said Joel L. Naroff, an economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.
Notably, employers pushed the hours worked by employees up at a 3.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, more than triple the first-quarter increase. It was the sharpest rise in hours worked in more than four years, since a 4.1 percent rate in the first quarter of 2006.
Any major pickup in hiring may be months away, however, since businesses still seem to be cutting costs while assessing whether consumer demand will pick up. Inflation-adjusted compensation per worker was flat in the second quarter and it shrank by 1.5 percent in the first quarter.
Separately, the Commerce Department said June wholesale inventories rose slightly by 0.1 percent to $399.2 billion but sales dropped 0.7 percent. Inventory restocking has been a driver of the recovery from the worst recession in decades. But falling sales will do little to encourage stockpiling.
Mike Englund, an economist at Action Economics, called the inventories data ''ugly'' and said it ''took a further chunk out of second-quarter G.D.P. growth.'' He said gross domestic product most likely expanded only 2 percent in the second quarter rather than the 2.4 percent so far estimated.
The productivity report showed unit labor costs, a gauge of potential inflation pressures closely watched by the Federal Reserve, edged up at a 0.2 percent annual rate after shrinking at a revised 3.7 percent rate in the first three months this year.
But the data pointed to growing pressure on household incomes, which in turn is likely to crimp the spending that drives overall economic activity.
Compensation per hour contracted at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter and was flat in the first three months of the year.
Weak productivity is in line with other broad signs that the economic recovery is losing momentum. The overall economy grew at only a 2.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, down from a 3.7 percent rate in the first quarter.

HEADLINE: Bill to Halt Certain Sales Of Artwork May Be Dead

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
A bill to prohibit cultural institutions from selling pieces from their collections to cover operating costs has all but died in the New York State Legislature, in the face of opposition from major cultural institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the withdrawal of support from the bill's Senate sponsor.
''It looks like it is lost for this session and for the foreseeable future,'' said Michael Botwinick, director of the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, who worked on the bill as a board member of the Museum Association of New York.
Some museums are already precluded from such sales by the state Board of Regents, but the bill would have made the practice illegal and expanded the prohibition to all museums. 
''The problem is, we'll have a two-tiered system,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, who led the drafting of the bill and is running for attorney general.
Though museums sell artworks all the time, they generally direct the proceeds toward acquiring other works of art. Many in the museum world have deemed selling -- or deaccessioning -- artworks to pay expenses a misuse of funds that jeopardizes preserving cultural heritage as a public trust.
But some museums that would have been affected by the bill argued that it was overly broad and confining and that they were fully capable of governing themselves.
A spokesman for the Met called the legislation ''impractical, unworkable and unneeded,'' and the Met's director, Thomas P. Campbell, wrote in an e-mail, ''While we respect efforts to bring clarity to the deaccessioning process, we believe the Metropolitan Museum has maintained a scrupulously transparent process for more than three decades -- tightly governed by its trustees, subject to review by the State Attorney General, and requiring that funds from deaccessioning be used only for the purpose of acquiring other works of art.''
The sense of urgency around deaccessioning has been spurred by several factors, including the National Academy Museum's sale in 2008 of two Hudson River School paintings to cover operating costs, and by the fear that financially challenged institutions are coming to the view that, as Mr. Botwinick put it, ''the Rembrandts in the collection are no different than the IBM stock.''
The decision last year by Brandeis University to close its Rose Art Museum and sell the collection was met with vehement protest. But in May the university said it was pursuing alternatives, namely working with Sotheby's to find ways to make money by lending works from the collection or entering into partnerships with other institutions.
In New York the Board of Regents has regulated the sale of artwork for some time; in December 2008 it implemented emergency regulations to prohibit the use of art-sale proceeds by museums for expenses, in response to Fort Ticonderoga's proposal to sell some of its artifacts to plug a shortfall, an idea it later abandoned.
''If we didn't do this at all, there would be no deaccession regulation on the books -- and deaccessioning is something that really needs to be kept within fairly narrow bounds,'' said James C. Dawson, who until last month was chairman of the Regents' cultural education committee. ''Museums hold their collections in the public trust. They should not be selling those off for operating funds or to pay debts.''
Partly because the legislation has stalled, the Regents, which drafted the bill with the Museum Association of New York, plan to make permanent the emergency regulations. But the rules cover only museums operating under state charters. Some of New York's largest museums, including the Met, operate under legislative charters and are not governed by the regulations.
The bill's Senate sponsor, Jose M. Serrano, said he withdrew support after hearing feedback from cultural institutions. ''We all saw that a one-size-fits-all approach was not going to work,'' he said. ''I didn't think that we would be able to make wholesale changes to the bill that would make it palatable for everyone.''
In particular, Mr. Serrano said he was troubled that the legislation would affect zoos, botanical gardens, aquariums and libraries. The Wildlife Conservation Society, which oversees the aquarium and most of the zoos in New York City, said the legislation would unfairly apply to its deaccessioning, which involves transferring animals to maintain valuable genetic populations and yields no revenue. ''It's a broad brush,'' said John Calvelli, a spokesman for the society. ''If there's an issue with deaccessioning property, then deal with that. Don't put in zoos and aquariums.''
Mr. Brodsky, who said he does not believe any other state has passed similar legislation, said he had been open to adjustments in the bill. For example, the bill now requires that institutions register classes of items rather than every item, in response to the American Museum of Natural History's complaint that it could not register every beetle in its collection.
The legislation was also changed to exempt institutions that had already used some artwork as collateral for a loan, as was the case with the Metropolitan Opera, which put up its Chagall murals as collateral.
The state regulations, which do not cover the opera house, already limit the use of artwork as collateral. In fact, the Chelsea Art Museum in Manhattan faces the possible removal of its charter because it pledged its permanent art collection as collateral for a mortgage loan.
Despite the modifications in the bill, several cultural groups maintained their resistance. The Hispanic Society of America, a museum and reference library in Upper Manhattan, took issue with the requirement that arts groups compile complete lists of what is in their collections.
''With the present economic environment it could have been disastrous for some institutions,'' said Mitchell Codding, the society's executive director. ''It would have entailed hiring a number of individuals to input the data and been a very slow process. We had a rough calculation it was going to cost us millions of dollars.''
Among the questions raised by both the bill and the Regents regulation is whether institutions can designate their historic buildings as collections and use the proceeds from deaccessioning for their maintenance.
''There are certain issues that are more complex than we anticipated,'' said Matthew Titone, a Democratic assemblyman who represents Staten Island and was a sponsor of the bill, ''but for the most part, people agree with the concept.''
Most institutions supported the bill, Mr. Brodsky said, citing the backing by the Museum Association, which represents some 360 cultural groups and individuals in the state.
''If we don't act here, the bean counters will triumph,'' he said, ''and we'll see huge amounts of public art privatized.''

HEADLINE: China's Trade Surplus Climbs to $28.7 Billion

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's trade surplus surged last month to its highest level in a year and a half, while real estate prices leveled off, according to government data released on Tuesday that pointed to possible trade frictions with the United States and slightly slower economic growth in China.
Stock markets across Asia weakened in response to the latest economic statistics, which included an unexpected slump in China's imports that seemed to suggest a softening of demand. 
The Shanghai stock market fell nearly 3 percent on Tuesday, and the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong tumbled 1.5 percent. Stock markets in countries like Australia that rely on commodity exports to China also dipped.
China's trade surplus climbed to $28.7 billion in July, the largest total since January of last year, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs. That was much more than the consensus expectation of economists for a surplus of about $19 billion, and it easily exceeded a surplus of $19.6 billion in June.
Economists said that the Chinese economy was likely to slow in the months ahead but not sharply, with annual growth edging below 10 percent this year or next year. A wealth of figures scheduled for release on Wednesday will give a more complete picture of economic output and demand in China.
But two economists at HSBC, Qu Hongbin and Sun Junwei, said in a research note that demand in China for raw materials seemed to be weakening, with a falling tonnage last month of imports of crude oil, iron ore, copper and aluminum.
China's central bank announced June 19 that it would begin to allow the country's currency, the renminbi, to fluctuate more against other currencies, a decision that the United States and others expected to lead to the renminbi's appreciation against the dollar. But the pace of that appreciation has been very slow so far, with the renminbi rising only 0.8 percent against the dollar since then.
Many politicians in the United States had argued that China was keeping the renminbi weak to lift its exports, giving China an unfair trade advantage and creating large trade surpluses. A stronger renminbi would make Chinese exports more expensive in foreign markets and would make foreign goods more affordable for Chinese buyers.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who favors a more confrontational trade strategy toward China, responded to the trade surplus by saying in a statement, ''These numbers show just how little motive China has to end its currency manipulation unless it is pushed to do so.''
Imports rose 22.7 percent in July from a year earlier, less than half the annual growth rate in June. But exports leaped 38.1 percent from an already strong showing in the same month last year.
China's policy of releasing a quick snapshot of trade less than two weeks after the end of each month provides one of the earliest glimpses of the strength of international demand, particularly for the consumer goods with which China increasingly dominates global markets. Some economists had expected growth in Chinese exports to weaken last month in an early sign of a possible double-dip recession in the West.
Some Chinese corporate executives are still worried about the possibility of a slowdown in exports in the months ahead.
Allen Dong, the export manager of the Ningbo Deye Domestic Electrical Appliance Technology Company in Ningbo, China, said that orders for future exports of the company's dehumidifiers to the United States and Europe had begun to weaken this summer. ''I think this may be partly due to the fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate against other currencies, and also the forever changing economic situation overseas,'' he said.
Like many Chinese companies, Ningbo Deye is trying to cushion its reliance on volatile exports by selling more in the domestic market. Domestic sales are now 55 percent of revenue and exports are the rest, compared with an even split last year, Mr. Dong said.
On Tuesday morning, the central bank set the opening value of the renminbi in Shanghai trading at 6.7745 to the dollar. That meant the renminbi was actually slightly weaker than on Monday, when it traded at 6.7685 to the dollar.
The central bank dominates trading of the renminbi through heavy intervention in the Shanghai market, selling renminbi heavily and buying United States dollars to prevent China's trade surpluses and inflows of foreign investment from pushing up the value of the renminbi.
The National Bureau of Statistics announced separately on Tuesday that average home prices in 70 large and medium-size Chinese cities were unchanged in July from June, and up 10.3 percent in July compared with a year ago.
The Chinese government has been trying since last spring to cool speculation in real estate markets. It has done so partly to limit the potential vulnerability of banks to mortgage defaults if real estate prices fall later, but also in response to a public outcry within China about the high cost of housing, as many young people question how they will be able to afford their first home.
July was the third consecutive month of slowing in the appreciation of real estate prices from a year earlier. But housing starts and construction have remained strong this summer, suggesting that the sector continues to contribute to China's overall economic growth.

HEADLINE: 10-Year Treasury Yields Slide On Fed's Decision to Buy Debt

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Keith Bradsher and Sewell Chan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Yields on 10-year Treasury securities, a vital benchmark for home mortgages and corporate loans, tumbled to the lowest level in more than a year on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve said it would buy up government debt in an effort to bolster the nation's increasingly fragile economy.
With no more room to reduce interest rates by decree, the Fed has decided to use its considerable market influence instead. By committing to buy up United States debt, the Fed hopes to increase demand for Treasury securities, pushing up their price while reducing their yields and, in turn, a range of interest rates. 
The news, which was widely expected on Wall Street, sent bond prices higher while the stock market fell. Rates on 30-year Treasuries briefly fell below 4 percent. The yield on a 10-year Treasury note dipped to 2.765 percent, from 2.83 before the announcement.
Yields on mortgage securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have a big impact on rates for home loans, fell to record lows.
The Fed's decision to buy up Treasury securities, using proceeds from the investments in mortgage securities accumulated during the financial crisis, is also an effort to ease the reluctance of consumers and businesses to spend money by making it cheaper to borrow and less attractive to save.
In a statement, the Fed said household spending continued to be constrained by high unemployment and tight credit, among other factors. Businesses, meanwhile, are largely sitting on their cash instead of hiring or investing in commercial real estate, the statement said.
With the federal funds rate already near zero and with few other arrows in the Fed's quiver, Wall Street has been left to speculate about how the Fed could take steps to address signs the recovery had stalled.
''We do need to get more stimulus out there, and this is one way the Fed can do it,'' said Brian A. Bethune, the chief economist at IHS Global Insight.
After the Fed's announcement on Tuesday, the stock market, which had been trading about 100 points lower, regained about half that.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 54.50 points, or 0.51 percent, to 10,644.25; the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 6.73 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,121.06; and the Nasdaq composite index declined 28.52 points, or 1.24 percent, to 2,277.17.
Some analysts predicted that the markets' relative confidence in the Fed's action would be short-lived.
''The initial response of the equity market, I believe, will be reversed as soon as investors realize that the Fed only took a baby step when the economy needs a giant leap,'' said Steven Ricchiuto, a chief economist for Mizuho Securities USA.
After weak reports on jobs and retail sales, the anticipation among investors and analysts had been rife. Would the Fed expand the money supply? Would it do something about the threat of deflation? Would it alter its language on the prospects for economic recovery?
Robert P. Andres, chief investment officer at Merion Wealth Partners, said he did not think the Fed move was significant, calling it ''gradualism.''
The decision allowed the Fed to convey the message that ''we are watching this, we are on top of it'' and that it was taking an initial step.
''The fact of the matter is, the step is nominal; what is it intended to do?'' Mr. Andres said. ''The 30-year Treasury is the cheapest on the yield curve right now.''
Are interest rates, he asked, the real problem? A more direct approach, he said, would be to give tax breaks to small-business owners.
''The problem is jobs, and this is not going to create jobs,'' Mr. Andres said. ''I think what it needs is a combination of a coordinated effort between the Fed and the administration, and I don't think that is going to happen.''
Shares of technology, financial and materials companies fell about 1 percent, while utilities stocks rose less than half a percent.
Intel fell 83 cents to $19.82, Microsoft lost 54 cents to $25.07 and Hewlett Packard fell 27 cents to $42.33. Citigroup declined 8 cents to $4 and Bank of America fell 28 cents to $13.63.
The AES Corporation, a developer of electric power projects, rose 9 cents to $11.16.
''The bond market is telling you something different from the stock market,'' said Raymond Remy, director of fixed income at Daiwa Capital Markets. ''The economic recovery is going on, with very good, solid corporate profits, and while the recovery may be slow, it is still in place.''
''And,'' he added, ''the bond market tells you the recovery is anemic and officially Washington is worried.''
While most of the attention Tuesday was focused on the Fed decision, other factors were at play.
The Labor Department said that worker productivity declined at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the second quarter after posting large gains throughout 2009. Labor costs edged up 0.2 percent in the period, the first increase since the spring of 2009. Some economists took the decline as an indication that companies might need to hire more workers soon.
A Commerce Department report showed a 0.1 percent increase in the value of inventories at United States wholesalers in June. The rise was less than analysts had forecast and suggested that companies were responding to slow demand by holding back inventory.
American indexes Tuesday were in line with the trend set by exchanges in Europe, where news that Chinese imports declined in July sent shares down. Economists said the Chinese economy was likely to slow but not sharply, with annual growth edging below 10 percent later this year or sometime next year.

HEADLINE: Obama's Youthful Voters More Likely to Skip Midterms

BYLINE: By MEGAN THEE-BRENAN

 BODY:
Will all of those young, enthusiastic Obama voters turn out in 2010? If history is any guide, probably not. Older voters are historically more likely to cast ballots in midterm elections than are voters under the age of 30. And this year, they are already more enthusiastic than younger voters about the coming campaign.
Those older voters are most likely to say the country is on the wrong track and to disapprove of the way both Congress and President Obama are doing their jobs, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted this summer. 
Eight in 10 Americans 45 and older disapprove of the job Congress is doing compared with 6 in 10 of those under age 45. While opinions about Congress differ depending on age, anti-incumbent sentiment cuts across generational lines, with about 8 in 10 Americans saying it is time to give new people a chance to serve.
A CNN poll conducted nationwide in mid-July found older voters were significantly more enthusiastic about voting this year than younger voters. Four in 10 of those aged 65 and older said they were extremely or very enthusiastic about voting in November while just one-quarter of those under 35 years of age said the same.
Still, while 45 percent of adults surveyed nationwide by the Pew Research Center in mid-June reported that they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting in this year's election, 36 percent said they were less enthusiastic. Both younger and older voters held similar views about voting this year.
This is not terribly surprising. A look at historical voting data shows that on the whole, the public is generally always less excited about voting in midterm elections. Voter turnout in midterm elections has consistently hovered around 50 percent for the past three decades, according to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey. In presidential election years, turnout is significantly higher, ranging from a low of 58 percent (in 1996) to a high of 68 percent (in 1992) among citizens 18 years of age and older. Turnout in 2008 was 64 percent.
Although presidential contests in the recent past have seen massive voter mobilization efforts, these programs are not as visible in off years. And this has had a noticeable effect at the voting booth.
Rock the Vote, aimed at getting out the youth vote, is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. The group acknowledges in promotional material that midterm turnout is historically lower, but it is nonetheless ramping up efforts and has set a goal to register at least 200,000 young voters this year (four times its 2006 registration).
In contrast, older voters do not need much prodding. Nancy LeaMond, AARP's executive vice president for social impact, said: ''We have not concentrated specifically on convincing our members that it's important to vote. We don't have to. That's a core value.''
History shows that a jump in turnout among young people would be unprecedented in an off-year election. Exit poll data shows that the electorate skews older, particularly in nonpresidential election years. In 2006, 63 percent of those who cast ballots were 45 or older, and in 2008, that same age group made up 53 percent of the electorate, according to exit poll data from the National Election Pool. This group made up about half of the adult population in those years.
''Habitual voters will show up for every election, and the sort of people that are habitual voters are what political scientists consider to be higher socioeconomic status -- they are more educated and they also tend to be older,'' said Michael McDonald, a professor of government at George Mason University and an expert in voter statistics.
In the summer of 1994, Congressional approval was almost as low as it is now, and President Bill Clinton's approval rating was in the mid-40s, much like President Obama's today. While the nation's economy was weak, it was not as fragile as it is today. On Election Day 1994, when Democrats lost control of Congress, only 13 percent of those who voted were under the age of 30.

HEADLINE: 3 Hit Movies Help Drive Disney Profit 40% Higher

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Profit soared nearly 40 percent at the Walt Disney Company in its most recent quarter, propelled by three blockbuster movies, strong merchandise sales and growth at ESPN.
But results for Disney's theme parks -- closely watched as a barometer of the broader economy -- were mixed as consumers reacted to price increases, adding to worries about a turnaround in consumer spending.
The overall results, which beat analyst forecasts by a wide margin, show the degree to which hit movies can bolster Disney, the world's largest media company. ''Toy Story 3,'' ''Alice in Wonderland'' and ''Iron Man 2'' -- the top three movies of the year with a combined $2.5 billion in global ticket sales -- are all owned by Disney and had parts of their runs in theaters during the quarter. 
Disney's movie unit swung to an operating profit of $123 million, in contrast to a loss of $12 million a year earlier, when duds like ''Confessions of a Shopaholic'' and smaller films like ''Hannah Montana: The Movie'' dragged down results.
Movies also powered other divisions. ''Toy Story 3'' in particular contributed substantial sales of related toys and apparel, driving operating income at Disney's consumer products division up 22 percent, to $117 million.
Still, it is too early to declare a recovery at Walt Disney Pictures, which has undergone a broad restructuring over the last year. While the division had enormous success in the third quarter, fourth-quarter releases like ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' and ''Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time'' have underperformed. (Disney took an unspecified write-down tied to ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' in the third quarter.)
Similarly in flux is Disney's theme park division. Operating income dipped 8 percent, to $477 million, during the quarter, a result of lower attendance and hotel occupancy as Disney cut back on the steep discounts it put in place during the peak of the downturn. Hotel room occupancy at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., for instance, dropped eight percentage points.
On the positive side, per capita guest spending was up by a small percentage and future bookings have not fallen off sharply.
Over all, Disney said net income for the period ended July 3 rose to $1.3 billion, or 67 cents a share. That compares with income of $954 million, or 51 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue climbed 16 percent, to $10 billion. Analysts had expected income of 58 cents a share.
Like other media conglomerates, Disney's television advertising rebounded during the quarter. ESPN, riding high ratings for World Cup matches and the N.B.A. finals, reported a 30 percent jump in advertising revenue. Ad sales at local stations and the ABC broadcast network were also stronger than a year ago.
But James A. Rasulo, Disney's chief financial officer, was cautious about painting an overly robust picture of the advertising landscape, telling analysts during a conference call that ''visibility remains somewhat limited.''
Media Networks, the Disney unit that includes ESPN and ABC, reported operating income of $1.9 billion. Aside from higher ad revenue, that result -- a 43 percent increase over the year-earlier period -- was driven by $255 million in affiliate fees that ESPN realized a quarter earlier than anticipated.

HEADLINE: Bank of Japan Leaves Low Rates Unchanged

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady at 0.1 percent on Tuesday and stopped short of taking new policy steps, despite a recent rise in the Japanese currency that threatened to undermine the country's nascent recovery. 
The central bank's decision came before the Federal Reserve announced Tuesday that it would seek to bolster the United States economy by using the proceeds from its huge mortgage-bond portfolio to buy long-term Treasury securities.
That could spur investment by helping to push down rates on mortgages and long-term corporate debt.
By buying government debt, the Fed is maintaining the large amount of money that it pumped into the economy, starting in 2007, to prop up the financial and housing markets.
Japanese interest rates have been at 0.1 percent since December 2008. The Bank of Japan has been under pressure from some in the government to loosen its already easy monetary policy in the hope of stimulating lending.
But there is debate about how much the central bank can or should do, after previous measures to ease monetary policy failed to do much to spur growth.
The central bank has experimented with steps like a fund-supply tool that offers cheap financing to banks, which was introduced in December and expanded in March.
Bank lending has not risen as expected, however, as the corporate appetite for borrowing has remained soft.
Pressure to act may increase on the Bank of Japan now that the Fed has indicated that it will further loosen monetary policy. That move could cause an even sharper rise in the yen.
The Japanese currency is already trading close to its highest level against the dollar in 15 years, as investors sell dollars for yen amid signs that the United States economic recovery is faltering.
Some investors may once again be viewing the yen as a haven because Japan still runs a surplus in its current account -- or the difference between total imports and exports -- making a run on the currency unlikely, the investment bank UBS wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.
A strong yen benefits some parts of the Japanese economy by increasing its purchasing power overseas. But its recent surge has battered Japanese exporters by making their products more expensive in foreign countries and eroding the value of their earnings.
At a news conference after its two-day policy meeting, which ended Tuesday, the Bank of Japan governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, preached caution.
''I acknowledge that yen rises pose a downside risk to business sentiment,'' he said. ''Foreign exchange moves are one factor affecting an economy, but they do not immediately lead to monetary policy. We need to examine the impact on the overall economy in a balanced way.''
Analysts said Mr. Shirakawa's comments demonstrated the central bank's continued reluctance to use more radical policy tools, including quantitative easing, in which the bank would increase the money supply by buying securities from the market.
Japan engaged in quantitative easing in the early 2000s, while the United States and Britain took similar steps during the recent global economic crisis.
''Barring a drastic deterioration in financial markets and elevated political pressure, it looks unlikely that the B.O.J. suddenly turns more aggressive,'' said Masamichi Adachi, an economist at J. P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo.

HEADLINE: Office Deals, 19 Months Apart, Show Market's Move

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
In real estate, as in life, timing is everything.
Two of New York's largest real estate brokerage firms, Cushman & Wakefield and CB Richard Ellis, have negotiated new leases for their Manhattan offices, and one seemed to get better terms than the other. The deals were struck 19 months apart, long enough to produce distinct changes in the market.
Cushman consolidated its three Midtown locations into a new building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas between 51st and 52nd Streets, and CBRE opted to remain where it was, in the MetLife Building, at 200 Park Avenue. Although both firms seem to have obtained favorable lease terms, CBRE, which signed its lease in December 2009, appears to have gotten a better deal than Cushman, which negotiated its lease in May 2008. 
Cushman's new 175,000-square-foot offices, home of its world headquarters, represent both a consolidation and downsizing from its three previous Midtown locations. Before the move, it occupied 175,000 square feet at 51 West 52nd Street, 40,000 square feet at 1350 Avenue of the Americas, and 13,000 square feet at 712 Fifth Avenue.
An industry executive familiar with the terms of Cushman's new 15-year lease with Vornado Realty Trust, owner of 1290 Avenue of the Americas, said it included an average rent of about $88 a square foot, some nine months of free rent and a tenant improvement allowance of approximately $55 a square foot. When Cushman moved into the building -- it occupies the entire seventh floor and parts of the eighth and ninth floors -- it also became the building's exclusive leasing agent.
Cushman's ability to serve as the agent of its new building could be significant.
''The types of tenants at 1290 could be meaningful; they are generally big-space users,'' said Lawrence J. Longua, clinical associate professor at the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University. ''When those leases roll, there's a lot of money to be made for the building agent,'' he said.
According to Cassidy Turley, a commercial real estate company, when Cushman signed its lease with Vornado in May 2008, the average asking rent for a Class A office building in the Rockefeller Center submarket was $108.14 a square foot, far more than Cushman paid. Last month this fell to a four-year low of $71.32.
A spokesman for Cushman declined to confirm terms of the lease, but said its ''net effective rent, including landlord contributions toward construction and free rent, was better than market for comparable space at the time we completed the lease. Rent was only one of the many considerations we had.''
CBRE's new 15-year lease in the MetLife Building, which is directly north of Grand Central Station and owned by Tishman Speyer Properties, will begin in June 2011. CBRE will occupy 125,771 square feet on the 19th, 20th, 21st and 22nd floors; it currently occupies approximately the same amount of space on floors 17 through 19.
Industry executives familiar with CBRE's new lease said it included an average rent of about $70 a square foot, approximately nine months of free rent and a tenant improvement allowance of about $55 a square foot. CBRE declined to comment on these terms.
In the Grand Central submarket, Cassidy Turley said the average asking rent for a Class A office building in December 2009, when CBRE signed its lease with Tishman Speyer, was $61.17 a square foot. This fell to $58.35 in April 2010, the lowest it had been since December 2005.
Joseph Harbert, chief operating officer of Cushman & Wakefield's New York metro region, said the company began considering its office space options in early 2007. Although Cushman had a clause in its lease at 51 West 52nd Street that would have allowed it to stay in the building for an additional five years at a fair market-value rent -- then about $100 a square foot -- he said the firm determined ''that to stay where we were at a very high rent would not let us achieve our objectives.''
''It was a tight market, and we narrowed our search down to three or four spaces that were reasonably close to what we wanted to achieve,'' he said.
Mr. Harbert said Cushman signed its lease ''when the market was vibrant,'' with ''high pricing and lack of availability. We signed in an up market. You sign when you have to sign.''
Mitchell E. Rudin, chief executive of the New York tristate region of CBRE, which occupies the company's MetLife offices, said CBRE began its search in the summer of 2008. Although its preference was to remain in the MetLife Building, ''the economy was such that we wouldn't have been able to stay here,'' he said. ''But as we embarked on the process, the market started to deteriorate and it appeared as a more likely alternative.''
Mr. Rudin said CBRE considered ''quite a number of buildings,'' looked at three, and began lease negotiations with Tishman Speyer in the summer of 2009. ''I believe we signed this at absolutely the optimum time,'' he said.
Cushman's new open offices, designed by Mancini Duffy, contain clusters of work stations, glass-walled offices along the perimeter of the floor, and only two corner offices, for its global and Americas chief executives. The offices contain 47,500 square feet of conference rooms and meeting space and two landscaped terraces. Building out the new offices cost about $185 a square foot.
Still being designed by the architectural design firm Gensler, CBRE's new offices also will be more open than before, but the company will retain corner offices for some senior executives. The centerpiece of the new space will be the new 21st floor, with the main reception area, meeting rooms, a dining room and terrace. Mr. Rudin declined to disclose the company's build-out cost.

HEADLINE: Trouble Abroad Adds to Worries For U.S. Recovery

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Keith Bradsher and Catherine Rampell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As economic recovery wavers in the United States, evidence is mounting that growth abroad is also slowing and may be unable to sustain the fragile rebound here.
Concerns about flagging global growth weighed heavily on stocks Thursday, as Japan's Nikkei index dropped more than 2 percent before recovering some of those losses, which came off steeper declines Wednesday in American equities.
Those market drops followed a spate of developments signaling a slowing economy both in the United States and abroad. On Tuesday, Federal Reserve officials warned that the pace of recovery in the United States had slowed. Then on Wednesday came news from China suggesting its fast-growing economy was cooling. And later that day, the Bank of England reduced its already diminished forecast for the British economy. 
Finally, new trade figures from Washington showed that American exports were faltering, a sign that hard-pressed domestic manufacturers could not rely on overseas markets to ease their pain at home.
Those reports sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling in a 265-point decline, moving it back into the red for the year. The broad market fell 2.8 percent. And those declines carried into Asia on Thursday morning.
The optimism that had pervaded Wall Street only weeks ago has faded quickly. In its place is a growing realization of what many Americans have been feeling in their bones: this is not the economic recovery the nation had hoped for. While the economy is growing again, it is growing too slowly to create many jobs or to increase household incomes.
Given the uneven rebound in the United States, and now signs that the world's other economic engines are slowing, economists say Americans may confront high unemployment and lackluster growth for some time to come.
''This is going to be a long slog,'' said David H. Resler, the chief United States economist at Nomura Securities International.
The trade report from the Commerce Department, which showed exports fell in June, prompted economists to sharply reduce their estimates of how fast the economy had been growing this year.
With the Chinese economy slowing, and European governments tightening their belts to bring down worrisome budget deficits, the fear is that the United States economy will get far less help from overseas than many people had expected.
Without that lift from abroad, and with domestic spending moribund, the American economy is gradually losing steam. Growth is slowing quarter by quarter. In the final three months of 2009, the economy grew at an annual rate of 5 percent. Growth then slowed to a 3.7 percent pace in the first quarter of 2010, then 2.4 percent in the second quarter.
But after downward revisions to other economic data like inventories and the export figures, even that 2.4 percent annual rate is now looking too rosy -- and may even be as low as 1 percent, some economists say.
The financial markets -- stocks as well as bonds -- have begun to adjust to the reality that growth is slowing not only in the United States but in many parts of the world. The reaction Wednesday was swift and painful, with stock markets around the world suffering their biggest setbacks since June.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 265.42 points, or 2.49 percent, to 10,378.83, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 31.59 points, or 2.82 percent, to 1,089.47. The Nasdaq fell 68.54 points, or 3 percent, to 2,208.63. Trading was relatively light, which exaggerated the decline.
With Wednesday's decline in U.S. equities markets, the Dow has once again wiped out all of its gains for the year. It is down nearly 0.5 percent so far in 2010, while the S.& P. 500 is off 2.3 percent. The Nasdaq is down about 2.7 percent.
As stocks declined, investors once again rushed for safety in government debt like United States Treasury securities, driving benchmark market interest rates to their lowest levels in more than a year. Bonds extended their gains from Tuesday when the Fed announced that it would use the proceeds of its huge mortgage-bond portfolio to buy long-term Treasury debt in an effort to keep rates low and encourage growth. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes -- a benchmark for many home mortgages and corporate loans -- fell to 2.68 percent, from 2.76 percent late Tuesday.
Investors now expect interest rates to remain low for months, if not years. Government bond yields fell even more sharply in overseas markets as signs emerged of a slowdown in growth there.
Caught in the crosswinds was the dollar. It had fallen over the last two months on investors' expectations that the rest of the world was growing more rapidly than the United States, but it reversed course on Wednesday, at least against the euro. After declining more than 10 percent against the yen in the last three months, the dollar dropped further to 84.72 yen on Wednesday, the lowest level since April 1995, before stabilizing Thursday.
Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said the June trade deficit, combined with other data, placed the economy ''on even shakier ground than it seemed, and underlining why the Fed has shifted towards an easing bias.''
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit widened to $49.9 billion in June, the largest gap since October 2008. Exports fell by 1.3 percent.
In China, several government indicators, including industrial output, retail sales and bank lending, slowed slightly in July, the government said. The data provided a fairly consistent snapshot of a country where economic growth remained the strongest in the world, but where the manic spending of the last few months had started to fade.
In Britain, the Bank of England cut its economic growth forecast, predicting annual growth to peak at 3 percent, less than the 3.6 percent it had predicted as recently as May. It blamed the uncertain pace of the recovery in the United States and the rest of Europe and reluctance by banks to increase lending.
Tom di Galoma, head of United States rates trading at Guggenheim Capital Markets, said the Fed's move on Tuesday underscored how concerned policy makers were about the state of the economy -- a concern ordinary Americans and, increasingly, Wall Street now share.
''There is certainly a lot of angst about when this recovery is going to take shape,'' Mr. di Galoma said.

HEADLINE: Rubin to Join Centerview, A Young Firm

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Robert E. Rubin is returning to Wall Street.
More than a year after he left Citigroup amid a firestorm of criticism over his role as a senior adviser to what was then the world's biggest bank, Mr. Rubin is planning to join a much smaller firm, the boutique investment bank Centerview Partners. Mr. Rubin had been seen at several meetings with Centerview clients in recent weeks, which had led to whispers about his next move. Centerview, founded in 2006, is planning to announce his appointment within the firm on Thursday.
Mr. Rubin, 71, a Treasury secretary under President Clinton and a longtime party elder among Democrats, is joining a firm with Democratic ties. Blair W. Effron, a co-founder of Centerview and a former banker at UBS, has become a strong force in Democratic political circles in Manhattan. One of the firm's other founders is Robert A. Pruzan, a protege of Bruce Wasserstein. 
Mr. Rubin is expected to bring a higher profile to the firm, acting as its eminence grise and helping advise clients.
''Having Bob as part of the fabric of the firm as we think through strategic issues is just a big benefit for us,'' Mr. Effron said.
Mr. Rubin started on the arbitrage desk at Goldman Sachs in 1966 and went on to become the firm's co-chairman. After running the Treasury, he returned to Wall Street, joining Citigroup. But as the financial crisis grew, Mr. Rubin came under fire for his role as chairman of the company's executive committee, where he led a board that blessed a strategy of taking on greater risks. The bank suffered billions of dollars in losses and received a $45 billion government rescue.
Mr. Rubin has since suggested he did not have nearly as much influence at Citigroup as the public might have thought. But that has not stopped some critics from blaming him. ''You were either pulling the levers or asleep at the switch,'' Philip N. Angelides, the chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, told Mr. Rubin during a hearing in April.
That might help explain why Mr. Rubin said he was not looking to work again on Wall Street after Citigroup.
''When I left Citi in January, I had a whole bunch of people come to talk to me about a couple of different things,'' he said in an interview. ''I was not planning to take on another major commitment.''
Mr. Rubin said he ''came over one day and sat in on a meeting'' at Centerview and ''it seemed like it would be very interesting to me.''
''I could help an extremely successful but younger firm grow, and I could work with clients.''
Despite the criticism of his tenure at Citigroup, some Wall Street denizens said Mr. Rubin was still seen as a powerful adviser who would attract Fortune 500 clients.
''He has some critics, but he still has a lot of credibility in the business world,'' said Richard I. Beattie, chairman of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. ''He's a got a unique combination of experiences.''
Before hiring Mr. Rubin, Centerview sought the views of some clients.
''I went to one of my big clients who has very different political views than Bob does and he said, 'Look, I think it would be fascinating to talk to him. I don't agree with what he says, but I certainly want to hear his point of view,' '' Mr. Pruzan said.
David M. Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell and a Centerview client, said he was interested in Mr. Rubin's counsel. ''Bob Rubin offers a sophisticated perspective on the macroeconomic issues affecting companies, industries and markets globally and has been at the nexus of the public and private sectors,'' he said.
Centerview has become a fast-rising star in advisory work on mergers and acquisitions and has worked on some of the most prominent deals in recent years. The firm advised Kraft on its $21.6 billion acquisition of Cadbury of Britain, Pepsi on its $21 billion acquisition of its two independent bottlers and the News Corporation on its $5.6 billion acquisition of Dow Jones.
The firm has added some other well-known talent to its executive ranks, including James M. Kilts, a former chief executive of Gillette and Nabisco and a former board member of The New York Times Company; Stephen S. Crawford, a former co-president of Morgan Stanley; and Adam D. Chinn, a former partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
Mr. Rubin continues to work as co-chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, the head of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution and as a board member of Harvard University. He will devote about a quarter of his time to Centerview and keep his main business office there.
''If you're going to be involved in policy issues, you have to be very current on what's going on the economy,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''Obviously, Centerview provides a terrific window. It's a symbiotic relationship and so it seemed to make sense.''

HEADLINE: Bad Debts Rise As Bust Erodes Home Equity

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD; John Collins Rudolf contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- During the great housing boom, homeowners nationwide borrowed a trillion dollars from banks, using the soaring value of their houses as security. Now the money has been spent and struggling borrowers are unable or unwilling to pay it back.
The delinquency rate on home equity loans is higher than all other types of consumer loans, including auto loans, boat loans, personal loans and even bank cards like Visa and MasterCard, according to the American Bankers Association.
Lenders say they are trying to recover some of that money but their success has been limited, in part because so many borrowers threaten bankruptcy and because the value of the homes, the collateral backing the loans, has often disappeared.
The result is one of the paradoxes of the recession: the more money you borrowed, the less likely you will have to pay up. 
''When houses were doubling in value, mom and pop making $80,000 a year were taking out $300,000 home equity loans for new cars and boats,'' said Christopher A. Combs, a real estate lawyer here, where the problem is especially pronounced. ''Their chances are pretty good of walking away and not having the bank collect.''
Lenders wrote off as uncollectible $11.1 billion in home equity loans and $19.9 billion in home equity lines of credit in 2009, more than they wrote off on primary mortgages, government data shows. So far this year, the trend is the same, with combined write-offs of $7.88 billion in the first quarter.
Even when a lender forces a borrower to settle through legal action, it can rarely extract more than 10 cents on the dollar. ''People got 90 cents for free,'' Mr. Combs said. ''It rewards immorality, to some extent.''
Utah Loan Servicing is a debt collector that buys home equity loans from lenders. Clark Terry, the chief executive, says he does not pay more than $500 for a loan, regardless of how big it is.
''Anything over $15,000 to $20,000 is not collectible,'' Mr. Terry said. ''Americans seem to believe that anything they can get away with is O.K.''
But the borrowers argue that they are simply rebuilding their ravaged lives. Many also say that the banks were predatory, or at least indiscriminate, in making loans, and nevertheless were bailed out by the federal government. Finally, they point to their trump card: they say will declare bankruptcy if a settlement is not on favorable terms.
''I am not going to be a slave to the bank,'' said Shawn Schlegel, a real estate agent who is in default on a $94,873 home equity loan. His lender obtained a court order garnishing his wages, but that was 18 months ago. Mr. Schlegel, 38, has not heard from the lender since. ''The case is sitting stagnant,'' he said. ''Maybe it will just go away.''
Mr. Schlegel's tale is similar to many others who got caught up in the boom: He came to Arizona in 2003 and quickly accumulated three houses and some land. Each deal financed the next. ''I was taught in real estate that you use your leverage to grow. I never dreamed the properties would go from $265,000 to $65,000.''
Apparently neither did one of his lenders, the Desert Schools Federal Credit Union, which gave him a home equity loan secured by, the contract states, the ''security interest in your dwelling or other real property.''
Desert Schools, the largest credit union in Arizona, increased its allowance for loan losses of all types by 926 percent in the last two years. It declined to comment.
The amount of bad home equity loan business during the boom is incalculable and in retrospect inexplicable, housing experts say. Most of the debt is still on the books of the lenders, which include Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.
''No one had ever seen a national real estate bubble,'' said Keith Leggett, a senior economist with the American Bankers Association. ''We would love to change history so more conservative underwriting practices were put in place.''
The delinquency rate on home equity loans was 4.12 percent in the first quarter, down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2009, when it was the highest in 26 years of such record keeping. Borrowers who default can expect damage to their creditworthiness and in some cases tax consequences.
Nevertheless, Mr. Leggett said, ''more than a sliver'' of the debt will never be repaid.
Eric Hairston plans to be among this group. During the boom, he bought as an investment a three-apartment property in Hoboken, N.J. At the peak, when the building was worth as much as $1.5 million, he took out a $190,000 home equity loan.
Mr. Hairston, who worked in the technology department of the investment bank Lehman Brothers, invested in a Northern California pizza catering company. When real estate cratered, Mr. Hairston went into default.
The building was sold this spring for $750,000. Only a small slice went to the home equity lender, which reserved the right to come after Mr. Hairston for the rest of what it was owed.
Mr. Hairston, who now works for the pizza company, has not heard again from his lender.
Since the lender made a bad loan, Mr. Hairston argues, a 10 percent settlement would be reasonable. ''It's not the homeowner's fault that the value of the collateral drops,'' he said.
Marc McCain, a Phoenix lawyer, has been retained by about 300 new clients in the last year, many of whom were planning to walk away from properties they could afford but wanted to be rid of -- strategic defaulters. On top of their unpaid mortgage obligations, they had home equity loans of $50,000 to $150,000.
Fewer than 5 percent of these clients said they would continue paying their home equity loan no matter what. Ten percent intend to negotiate a short sale on their house, where the holders of the primary mortgage and the home equity loan agree to accept less than what they are owed. In such deals primary mortgage holders get paid first.
The other 85 percent said they would default and worry about the debt only if and when they were forced to, Mr. McCain said.
''People want to have some green pastures in front of them,'' said Mr. McCain, who recently negotiated a couple's $75,000 home equity debt into a $3,500 settlement. ''It's come to the point where morality is no longer an issue.''
Darin Bolton, a software engineer, defaulted on the loans for his house in a Chicago suburb last year because ''we felt we were just tossing our money into a hole.'' This spring, he moved into a rental a few blocks away.
''I'm kind of banking on there being too many of us for the lenders to pursue,'' he said. ''There is strength in numbers.''

HEADLINE: President Kagame's Win in Rwanda

 BODY:
There were no surprises in Rwanda's election this week. Not the winner -- President Paul Kagame -- or the overwhelming nature of his victory, which official figures put at 93 percent. He made it impossible for the results to be anything different. 
Rwandans had good reasons for keeping Mr. Kagame in office for another seven-year term. Sixteen years after Hutu death squads killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in a genocidal rampage, Rwanda is in many ways a showcase. And Mr. Kagame, a former bush leader in control of the country since 1994, can claim a lot of the credit.
Although poor and tiny, Rwanda is one of the developing world's most orderly and crime-free societies. There are new roads, health clinics and schools; national health care; Internet service and millions of dollars in foreign investment. Transparency International, a corruption monitor in Germany, rates Rwanda as the least corrupt country in East Africa. Women may now inherit land. Rwanda has the highest share of women in government of any country in the world.
There is also a dark side. President Kagame made it almost impossible for anyone else to seriously challenge him, much less win. In the months before the election, news reports were filled with alarming developments: the deputy editor of Umuvugizi, an independent newspaper, was shot dead outside his house in Kigali; the deputy leader of the opposition Green Party was found with his head almost hacked off.
There was a failed assassination attempt on the former chief of Rwandan intelligence, a Kagame critic who now lives in South Africa.
Human Rights Watch documented what it described as a ''worrying pattern of intimidation, harassment and other abuses'' against opposition parties, journalists and members of civil society. Most independent journalists were silenced, the two main independent newspapers suspended and the government prevented the three parties that openly criticized Mr. Kagame from participating in the election.
Before the election, he sent his foreign minister to Washington and New York City to meet officials and journalists and rebut all criticism and charges of government involvement in the killings and repression. ''There is political space in Rwanda, but there is nobody to occupy the space'' except Mr. Kagame, Louise Mushikiwabo told The Times.
That kind of thinking is a recipe for dictatorship and even more repression -- not the democratic state President Kagame has promised. He is heavily dependent on aid from Britain, the European Union and the United States. They must press him to use his new term to foster broad political debate and participation and to strengthen independent news media and civil society. His refusal to do so will threaten the very stability and economic growth that he has nurtured.

HEADLINE: Odds Defied? He Knows The Territory

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ; Robert Davey and Elizabeth Maker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As a child, Dannel P. Malloy was not given much of a chance. ''I was diagnosed as mentally retarded as late as the fourth grade,'' he recalled. His mother, he added, would not accept that.
''My mother knew it wasn't true,'' Mr. Malloy said in an interview on Wednesday. ''My mother made the decision to concentrate on what I was good at, and slowly the issues resolved themselves.''
It turned out that Mr. Malloy was dyslexic. He made it to college and law school before serving as a prosecutor and then as the longest-tenured mayor of Stamford, Conn., the state's fourth-largest city. 
On Tuesday night, Mr. Malloy pulled off another unexpected feat, capturing the Democratic nomination for governor of Connecticut in an upset over Ned Lamont, a businessman who spent nearly $9 million of his own money on the race and led in the polls for the entire campaign.
Now Mr. Malloy heads into the general election confronting another wealthy businessman, Thomas C. Foley, who spent his own millions to win the Republican nomination for governor.
Though recent polls have shown Mr. Malloy with a comfortable lead, Mr. Foley, who has proved to be a durable and feisty campaigner, wasted little time on Wednesday jumping into what is sure to be a spirited fight.
At a brief campaign stop in Middletown, Mr. Foley tried to cast himself as an outsider taking on a career politician. ''I'm the candidate for change,'' he said. ''He's the candidate for staying the course.''
Mr. Malloy, in turn, made it clear that he was prepared to make Mr. Foley's wealth an issue at a time of economic hardship for many voters.
''Every time I hear somebody who's worth hundreds of millions of dollars talk about a person making $50,000 and their pension, is a good day for me,'' Mr. Malloy said during an appearance at his campaign headquarters in Hartford.
Mr. Malloy has faced more than his share of personal and professional trials as he approaches his goal of becoming governor; he would be the state's first Democrat in the office in nearly 20 years.
He attended Boston College, where he graduated magna cum laude despite his disability. ''I listened to books on tape,'' he said, ''and I did it until the first semester of my sophomore year.''
He went on to Boston College Law School and then to a job as a prosecutor. Eventually, he returned to Stamford, where he entered politics and, in 1995, became mayor. In that post, he oversaw Stamford's resurgence, as new office buildings and retail development attracted businesses and visitors to a city that had long been in decline.
But his tenure was not without problems. At one point, Mr. Malloy was accused of awarding contracts to companies that made renovations to his home. While a 2006 investigation found no evidence that Mr. Malloy gave preferential treatment to the contractors, the issue had continued to follow him, with Mr. Lamont criticizing him over the matter during the primary campaign.
Ever ambitious, Mr. Malloy decided to take a shot at higher office. In 2006, he began a campaign for governor, eventually winning the endorsement of the state Democratic leadership at the party's convention. But he lost the primary election a few months later to John DeStefano Jr., the mayor of New Haven.
The outcome apparently shook Mr. Malloy. ''On primary night in 2006,'' said Roy Occhiogrosso, a friend and political adviser, ''it was like he was thinking about how long it had taken to get to that point and how long it would take to get back to that point if he chose to run again. I'm sure he wondered that night if it might be over.''
Three years later, Mr. Malloy was back, creating an exploratory campaign for the 2010 governor's race. But he was soon confronted with a family crisis involving his son that played out publicly.
In March 2009, his son Ben, who was 21 at the time, was arrested on charges that he and two other people had tried to rob a man of marijuana. Mr. Malloy and his wife, Cathy, confronted the matter publicly, saying their son had suffered from a form of depression. And many people in politics, sympathizing with the Malloys' situation, left it at that, saying the episode was a private matter.
''I have a son who had difficulties,'' Mr. Malloy said Wednesday when asked about Ben, the middle of three sons. ''He's doing well. He's in treatment.''
Now, looking ahead to what is shaping up as a tough election contest in the fall, people who have known Mr. Malloy for years say he is ready.
''I have seen Dan Malloy tested in ways that would make most people leave the battlefield,'' said Andrew J. McDonald, a state senator from Stamford who is a close friend.

HEADLINE: When the Fed Speaks

 BODY:
It was a statement of the obvious heard around the world. The Federal Reserve policy committee said on Tuesday that the economy had slowed recently and was not expected to improve anytime soon. Together with evidence of slower growth in China and Europe, the ''news'' sparked a global sell-off in stocks on Wednesday. At the same time, prominent private forecasts for growth in the second quarter were revised downward from a preliminary reading of 2.4 percent in the United States to less than 2 percent. 
The market response sent an even louder message than the Fed statement -- that the economy needs more and better help than it is getting and more, unfortunately, than it is likely to get in the current soured political environment.
No one should have been surprised by the obstacles to growth cited by the Fed -- high unemployment, modest income gains, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Nor was it a surprise that the Fed pledged to keep interest rates low, given the faltering economy. As a practical matter, that means the short-term rate it controls will remain close to zero for the foreseeable future. And to keep downward pressure on long-term rates, like mortgages, it is planning to recycle the proceeds from its mortgage-backed securities, acquired during the financial crisis, into Treasury securities.
None of those measures add up to much of a boost, if any, because the Fed is not providing new stimulus. Rather, it is simply promising to not tighten the spigot prematurely. It also promised to do more if the economy were to deteriorate further, a reference to its ability -- and, presumably, its willingness -- to create new money to pump into the system to make credit even cheaper.
So why are the markets unnerved? Simply put, it is increasingly plain to see that the Fed has all but played its hand, and the economy is still in deep trouble. The economy's central problem is not lack of money to hire workers or make loans or rates that are too high. It is lack of hiring and lack of lending, despite cash cushions at many corporations and big banks and rates that are already very low.
As long as the economy is weak and getting weaker, employers will be reluctant to hire new workers and banks will be reluctant to lend to small businesses. As long as hiring and lending are constrained, consumers will be reluctant to spend, and the economy will be weak.
A way out of that bind is stimulative fiscal policy, but Congress is gridlocked. Recent delays and cutbacks have shown that lawmakers cannot even be counted on to consistently provide emergency aid, like unemployment benefits, or robust support for obvious problems, like ailing state budgets. They have yet to provide new incentives for small business lending, let alone to support or even seriously debate bold ideas to create jobs, like a federally supported agency to help finance the repair and rebuilding of the nation's infrastructure.
The Fed's statement on Tuesday avoided the words deflation and double dip recession. But the markets heard them, still, because the Fed's efforts alone are unlikely to steer the nation clear of those dangers.

HEADLINE: Unneeded Bureaucracy at Ground Zero

 BODY:
As the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan moves ahead with renewed energy, there is one dismal exception to the progress at the former World Trade Center site. That is the muddle at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, an extra layer of bureaucracy originally set up to get the rebuilding started. Nine years later, the corporation has become an impediment. It needs to finish its few remaining tasks and disband. 
The two main items still on the development corporation's books are to demolish the last eight stories of the Deutsche Bank tower and to finish giving out what was once more than $2 billion to help revive Lower Manhattan. This development corporation, originally led by John Whitehead, was created in the chaos after Sept. 11, 2001. The city and state needed one respected board to start untangling all the different demands for the site.
The development corporation's board also was an independent enough group to make certain that federal dollars went directly to those in need, not merely to those in favor in Albany or City Hall.
Since then, with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in control of construction and the disagreements with the developer Larry Silverstein finally settled, there is dramatic progress on the site. Contributions for the centerpiece of the Lower Manhattan site -- the memorial -- have now reached more than $360 million, enough to make much of the ground-level section ready for the 10th anniversary of the attacks next year.
In contrast, the demolition of the bank tower by the development corporation has been slow, dangerous and costly. The lagging distribution of federal money also is inexplicable. As made clear by Julie Menin, a community advocate who has complained loudly in recent months, there is at least $170 million in one fund and $70 million in another that is stagnating in the development corporation's accounts.
This is money that should be used immediately for community development or a bus garage or a cultural center or economic revitalization. The big utilities downtown want this money and have the muscle to get it, but they should not be allowed to bully the development corporation into giving them too large a share of the funds.
The bank building is scheduled to be demolished by December. The money should easily be divided soon afterward. That will leave the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation with one more task: declaring itself officially out of business.

HEADLINE: Say Goodbye to Fannie and Freddie

BYLINE: By WILLIAM POOLE. 
William Poole, a senior fellow with the Cato Institute and a distinguished scholar in residence at the University of Delaware, was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis from 1998 to 2008.

 BODY:
Elkton, Md.
THE Federal National Mortgage Association -- known as Fannie Mae -- and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation -- Freddie Mac -- were poorly structured from the time, 40 years ago, when they were set up as so-called government-sponsored enterprises. Both of these technically private companies, designed to foster the issuance of home mortgages, enjoyed implicit federal backing in the event they got into financial trouble but only weak regulation to prevent such trouble. Essentially, the federal government insured the companies' liabilities but never charged a premium.
Fannie and Freddie had a license to print money. They could borrow at an interest rate only a bit over the Treasury rate and then accumulate large portfolios of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities earning the market rate. What a deal -- borrow at the low rate, invest at a higher one, hold little capital and let the federal government bear the risk! Investors enjoyed high returns, and management enjoyed high salaries. Incidentally, politicians also got a steady flow of campaign contributions from the companies' executives. 
Fannie and Freddie's risky policies led to their near collapse; in September 2008, the federal government brought them under federal conservatorship. Fannie and Freddie have cost taxpayers about $150 billion so far.
On Tuesday, the Obama administration plans to hold a conference to address the question of what to do with the two companies. Clearly, it would be an inexcusable mistake to reconstitute them as private companies in anything close to their prior form. Some people have suggested recasting them as a single new ''Fan-Fred agency'' that would continue to securitize and guarantee home mortgages. It's true that Fannie and Freddie played an important role in developing the market for mortgage-backed securities. But they have completed that work, and they should not be preserved in any form. They should be thanked for their successes and gracefully retired.
Can the home mortgage market stand on its own, without support from federally sponsored mortgage companies? Experience tells us that the answer is an unambiguous yes. When Fannie and Freddie curtailed their operations after the disclosure of accounting irregularities in 2003, there was no effect on mortgage rates. We have seen how the jumbo mortgage market, for loans too large to be eligible for Fannie and Freddie purchases, has long operated efficiently, with rates only slightly above the rates on smaller mortgages. And many other asset markets, like the one for securitized auto loans, have functioned well without federal intermediaries.
If Fannie and Freddie were to continue to operate with the government absorbing all their risk, they would keep a large share of the market. But that system has been terribly expensive for taxpayers. The evidence shows that the private market can originate, securitize and distribute home mortgages efficiently on its own. While it's true that the private market brought on the financial crisis by creating so many subprime mortgages, Fannie and Freddie did not block that parade; they joined it -- indeed, in some respects led it.
In principle, it ought to be possible for government financial agencies to be self-supporting. But decades of observation have convinced me that there is no practical way to prevent the government from inserting hidden subsidies and special interest mandates into the agencies' operations. If there are to be more federal housing subsidies -- and I hope there are not -- they should be legislated transparently.
The danger in having any new mortgage agency is that its guarantees would subsidize mortgage risk, eventually leading to further taxpayer losses. The only sure way to prevent that outcome is to phase out Fannie and Freddie. If the home finance market were fully private, then it would bear the losses from its own mistakes in pricing and insurance. The proper government role is regulatory oversight and not direct operation of financial firms.
Fannie and Freddie could not be shuttered immediately; they are too large. A sensible transition plan would have them stop buying new mortgages, and their portfolios would decline as the mortgages they own are paid down. Within 10 years, the portfolios would shrink to insignificance.
Their securitization business, whereby they purchase mortgages and issue securities against them, should likewise be wound down. A practical approach would be to set a gradually rising schedule of fees, motivating private companies to enter the securitization business.
In 10 or 15 years, the companies would be gone, closing a chapter in American financial history that enjoyed considerable success but ended very badly and at great taxpayer cost.

HEADLINE: The 30-Year Prison

BYLINE: By KATHERINE V. W. STONE. 
Katherine V. W. Stone, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, is the author of ''From Widgets to Digits: Employment Regulation for the Changing Workplace.''

 BODY:
Los Angeles
THE roots of the mortgage crisis are well known -- overly aggressive lenders, overly optimistic borrowers and lax regulation of financial firms. But as policymakers search for a resolution, they need to recognize another critical aspect of the problem: today's mortgages are designed for yesterday's borrowers.
Until recently, most Americans paid for their homes through 30-year self-amortizing mortgages, in which interest and principal are paid at the same time. These work well as long as homeowners have stable, long-term jobs that enable them to regularly make their monthly payments. 
But these days such careers are increasingly scarce. Therefore, any effort to recover from the crisis must include more flexible mortgages that take today's employment landscape, with its frequent job-hopping and episodic unemployment, into account.
It's not as if the 30-year self-amortizing mortgage has been around forever. In fact, it is a fairly recent invention. Before the 1930s, homes were financed by three- to five-year balloon loans. Homeowners made interest-only payments for the duration of the loan, then typically rolled them over into new loans when they came due.
During the Great Depression, however, many borrowers were unemployed when their loans came due; banks were reluctant to offer new loans, and owners had not accumulated enough money to pay off their loans. The result was a wave of foreclosures.
In response, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, created as part of the New Deal, developed a new kind of loan: instead of a few years of small payments followed by a very large one, homeowners would make regular payments of interest and principal for 30 years. They would accumulate equity over time, and the loan would be fully paid off around the time they retired.
In the old economy, periods of joblessness were a clear sign of an unreliable borrower. Today, they are simply a function of the job market, which flexible mortgages would take into account.
There are several options for reforming mortgages. For starters, the Federal Housing Administration could require that any mortgage it insures allow borrowers who are involuntarily out of work to convert to an interest-only loan for up to two years. Once they got a new job, their loans would switch back. Because the administration insures almost a third of all markets, it has the influence to make this standard practice across the industry.
Such a provision would significantly alleviate the financial burden for the borrower. For example, a conventional mortgage of $100,000 at 6 percent interest requires a monthly payment of $600. But if the borrower lost his job in the first month and the loan became interest-only, the monthly payment would be reduced to $500. The longer the borrower held the loan, the smaller the interest portion of each payment, making the savings even greater for long-term homeowners.
A temporary conversion would lengthen the period of the loan but would not increase the principal. Banks would continue to receive the same amount of interest that they bargained for and would avoid more foreclosures.
Another option is for the federal government to create a ''career transition bank'' that unemployed borrowers could draw on to meet their payments. To take part, workers and employers would make pretax contributions to personal accounts, and withdrawals would be limited to the amount accumulated. If the money wasn't used by the time a worker retired, it would be paid out as a lump sum and taxed like pensions or Social Security.
Neither step should replace efforts to reform housing or financial industry regulation. But changing home loans to reflect the new, unstable employment landscape is crucial if we want to address the mortgage crisis over the long term.

HEADLINE: Quick Change In Strategy For a Bookseller

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
In the movie ''You've Got Mail,'' Tom Hanks played the aggressive big-box retailer Joe Fox driving the little bookshop owner played by Meg Ryan out of business.
Twelve years later, it may be Joe Fox's turn to worry. Readers have gone from skipping small bookstores to wondering if they need bookstores at all. More people are ordering books online or plucking them from the best-seller bin at Wal-Mart.
But the threat that has the industry and some readers the most rattled is the growth of e-books. In the first five months of 2009, e-books made up 2.9 percent of trade book sales. In the same period in 2010, sales of e-books, which generally cost less than hardcover books, grew to 8.5 percent, according to the Association of American Publishers, spurred by sales of the AmazonKindle and the new AppleiPad. For Barnes & Noble, long the largest and most powerful bookstore chain in the country, the new competition has led to declining profits and store traffic. After the company announced last week that it was putting itself up for sale, Leonard Riggio, Barnes & Noble's chairman and largest shareholder, who has declared his confidence in the company's future, hinted that he might make a play to buy the company himself and take it private. 
For readers, e-books have meant a transformation not just of the reading experience, but of the book-buying tradition of strolling aisles, perusing covers and being able to hold books in their hands. Many publishers have been astounded by the pace of the e-book popularity and the threat to print book sales that it represents. If the number of brick-and-mortar stores drops, publishers fear that sales will go along with it. Some worry that large bookstores will go the way of the record stores that shut down when the music business went digital.
''The shift from the physical to the digital book can pick up some of the economic slack, but it can't pick up the loss that is created when you don't have the customers browsing the displays,'' said Laurence J. Kirshbaum, a literary agent. ''We need people going into stores and seeing a book they didn't know existed and buying it.''
Carolyn Reidy, the chief executive of Simon & Schuster, said in an interview that e-books currently made up about 8 percent of the company's book revenue. She predicted that it could be as high as 40 percent within three to five years.
''E-books are moving faster and faster all of the time, which makes things look harder for bricks-and-mortar stores,'' said Mike Shatzkin, founder and chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, which advises book publishers on digital change.
Iris Reeves, a 53-year-old administrative assistant in East Texas, is one of the bookstore holdouts. Nearly every weekend, she and her husband drive 60 miles to the nearest Barnes & Noble for a long browsing session. She buys several paperbacks (thrillers, science fiction and paranormal romance) and he buys nonfiction (with a few auto magazines thrown in).
She has watched with alarm as dozens of bookstores, both independents and chains like Crown Books, have disappeared. Beyond Barnes & Noble and Borders, the only other retailers nearby that sell new books, she said, are religious bookstores.
''I don't want to lose the option of actually going into a bookstore and handling a book,'' Ms. Reeves said. ''I like going up and down the aisles, seeing what's there. If I had my druthers, it would be paper books all the way.''
Whoever ends up in control of Barnes & Noble's 720 retail stores will have to grapple with the fundamental changes in the industry -- and if the shift to e-books continues, prove that Barnes & Noble can be as successful on the digital side of bookselling as it has been for print.
William Lynch, the chief executive, said in an interview on Friday that the chain was retooling its stores to build up traffic, add products like educational toys and games, and emphasize its own e-reader, the Nook.
''We think we've got the right strategy,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''The growth in our e-books business is about nine months ahead of our plan.''
It is a rare moment of uncertainty for the company. In the 1990s heyday of the superstore, Barnes & Noble reigned supreme, expanding its reach rapidly and dazzling customers with an enormous array of books and steep discounts that smaller, independent stores could not match. Mr. Riggio, a tough and innovative figure, was hailed as the most powerful man in the book business.
''As Barnes & Noble grew, there was a lot that was very good for publishers and authors,'' said David Steinberger, the chief executive of the Perseus Books Group. ''They were energetic, they were aggressive, they were terrific on author events. They were terrific at broadening the selection available.''
But recently, Barnes & Noble has had to contend with Amazon.com, which has led on e-books and whose vast selection of print books is available online. The release of Apple's iPad in April only increased interest in e-books.
''This company is going to go through a really fundamental existential struggle,'' said Peter Osnos, the founder and editor at large of PublicAffairs, an independent publisher. ''What you have is this aggregation of factors -- the changes in the way book buying is taking place, the general sluggishness of the economy, the management issues at Barnes & Noble. All of those things together create a set of problems which are really quite striking.''
At the expansive Barnes & Noble store in Manhattan's Union Square, the changes sweeping the company and the industry are on full display. Shelves have been stripped bare to make room for toys and games, as a sign dangling from the ceiling cheerfully announces.
''I'm in favor of anything that brings traffic in the store,'' said Ms. Reidy of Simon & Schuster. ''If it's toys or games that brings a family into the bookstore, then I say fine.''
The company is also taking significant steps to capture the digital market. In September, it will begin building 1,000-square-foot boutiques to showcase the Nook in all of its outlets.
Samantha Robinson, a 24-year-old student, paused outside the Union Square store last week, a newly purchased Nook in her hand.
''I'm going to buy as many books as I can on the e-reader, because they're less expensive,'' Ms. Robinson said.
And if she stopped buying print books altogether? ''I wouldn't miss it,'' she said.
In a twist straight out of the movies, some publishers speculated that many of the independents that survived the big chains over the last 15 years might be in an unusually stable position. By the American Booksellers Association's count, there are more than 2,000 independent bookstores in the United States.
''Being small and privately held allows us to be more nimble,'' said Chris Morrow, owner of the Northshire Bookstore in Manchester Center, Vt. ''Our competitive advantage has been the curation aspect -- knowing our customers and picking the right books.
''We still have that competitive advantage,'' he added. ''Barnes & Noble doesn't have that.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans More Aid for Jobless Homeowners

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
In an acknowledgment that the foreclosure crisis is far from over, the Obama administration on Wednesday pumped $3 billion into programs intended to stop the unemployed from losing their homes.
The housing market, which usually helps lead the country out of a recession, is this time helping hold the recovery back. Interest rates are at record lows, but too few can afford to buy or refinance. Unemployed homeowners who live in communities where values have fallen sharply are often unable to sell. Their foreclosures weaken neighborhoods and create a vicious circle by further undermining the market.
To try to break this pattern, the Treasury Department said it was adding $2 billion to its Hardest Hit Fund, roughly doubling its size. The fund, first announced by President Obama in February and expanded in March, goes to housing finance agencies in various states to create local aid programs. 
Most of the state programs from the first two rounds are barely under way, but Treasury officials said it was clear that more funds were needed.
''In this very deep recession, people have tended to be out of work a little longer,'' Herbert M. Allison Jr., assistant secretary for financial stability, said. ''That's why we think this additional relief for people searching for a job is so important.''
The second program, announced by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, will draw on $1 billion authorized by the new financial overhaul law.
The agency said it would work with local aid groups to offer bridge loans of up to $50,000 to eligible borrowers to help them pay their mortgage principal, interest, insurance and taxes for up to 24 months. The loans will be interest-free.
Until now, the Hardest Hit Fund had been projected to help about 140,000 borrowers. Treasury officials said that number would grow with the new infusion of money, but offered no estimate. HUD also did not say how many homeowners would be eligible for its program.
If the new money is spent in the same way as the previous money, both programs would eventually aid about 400,000 borrowers -- a large number, but not when set against the 14.6 million unemployed or three million contemplating foreclosure.
Over the last two years, the government has deployed many programs to help housing. It pushed interest rates down, offered tax credits and set up an ambitious mortgage modification program. Yet housing remains feeble and seems poised after a brief respite this year to become weaker again.
''I think all these government programs are helpful, but I wouldn't look for them to cure the recession or even what ails housing,'' said the economist Karl E. Case. ''At best, they're preventing things from getting much worse.''
The Hardest Hit Fund will draw on the $45.6 billion set aside for housing in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the rescue measure begun at the height of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008. Initially, the fund gave $1.5 billion to five hard-hit states: Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan and Nevada. The second round in March of $600 million went to North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
The expanded list of states eligible for the latest funding includes Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi and New Jersey, as well as the District of Columbia. Each state's share of the money is based on its population.
Many of the programs involve direct assistance. Ohio, for instance, said it would use its $172 million to aid 15,356 homeowners by helping bring delinquent mortgages current for owners experiencing hardship because of a loss of income. The assistance will last up to 12 months.
The other housing money in the Troubled Asset Relief Program is earmarked for the modification programs ($30.6 billion) and a Federal Housing Administration refinancing program ($11 billion). The administration can shift money between the programs only until Oct. 3, the two-year anniversary of the program.
HUD said it was in the process of determining which communities would receive its money and how exactly the process would work. ''We're still in the design phase,'' said Bill Apgar, HUD senior adviser for mortgage finance.

HEADLINE: Sharing a National Identity, Emerging Artists Engaging in a Visual Language

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
Small though it is, Israel has been providing more than its share of artistic talent to the global art circuit, especially where video and performance art are concerned.
Over the past decade Guy Ben-Ner has become known for what might be called home videos, starting with a version of ''Moby-Dick'' shot in his kitchen, starring himself and his young daughter; Tamy Ben-Tor has startled the art world with scathing depictions of a cast of characters ranging from a pretentious art theorist to an aging Nazi; Mika Rottenberg has created a genre of disorienting video installations centering on women enacting strange tasks; Ohad Meromi, another sculpturally inclined video installationist, has revisited ''The Odyssey'' and Brecht.
And the redoubtable Omer Fast has alternated between rapid-fire sampling of existing material and elaborately staged works, making some of the most gripping, astutely political videos of the moment. 
''Greater New York,'' the current survey of emerging artists at MoMA P.S. 1 in Long Island City, Queens, has at least three memorable contributions by young Israelis, and the summer show at the Lesley Heller Workspace on the Lower East Side is using those very words as a title, supplemented by a portentous definite article. ''The Young Israelis,'' which closes on Saturday, presents 16 videos and several related photographs by 10 artists, including the three Greater New Yorkers.
Organized by the critic and independent curator Lilly Wei, ''The Young Israelis'' is not without weak points or generically familiar inclusions. Nonetheless, for the most part it suggests that a certain chemistry often exists between Israel -- its history, landscape, politics and cities -- and young artists wielding video cameras.
Several of the pieces are standard emergent video work, including Karen Russo's 2005 ''Economy of Excess,'' a micro-video-camera journey through the sewer system of Essex, England. Despite the sense of trippy abstraction resulting from manipulations of color and plunging space, it is overly indebted to a video excursion through the sewers of Zurich from the 1990s by Peter Fischli and David Weiss.
A similar derivativeness plagues Nira Pereg's ''And Melancholy,'' which visits the balconies of the different buildings in Tel Aviv where she has lived. At each site the view is surveyed, and the camera then plunges to the ground, creating the effect -- suggested by the title -- of a series of suicide jumps.
In ''Volcano Demo'' and ''Sunset Demo/Sonya,'' Tom Pnini simulates natural events using hand-built mock-ups -- a papier-mache volcano on top of his parents' apartment building in Tel Aviv, a large orange circle attached to an ocean pier -- but they don't add much more than an endearing footnote to the history of set-up video. A much better impression is made by Lior Shvil, whose comic ''RoughCut'' shows him in a symbiotic if sometimes violent relationship with a life-size cloth puppet of a dark-bearded male figure in a keffiyeh.
As for Gilad Ratman, I recommend seeing his recent video of disembodied faces and hands emerging from and sinking into an expanse of gray sludge in ''Greater New York,'' which runs through Oct. 18. His contributions at Heller are earlier and not as convincing, although they provide a baseline of his artistic growth.
Israel as a place of strange vistas and fraught history is intensely present in the work of Oded Hirsch, whose task-oriented videos are among the show's most haunting. Shot on or near the kibbutz where he grew up, and cast with people who live there, both works depict oddly pointless physical feats in spectacularly isolated landscapes. In his ''50 Blue'' (2009), he pushes a wheelchair holding his paralyzed father in a yellow slicker up muddy paths to a rocky palisade that evokes the battle of Masada. He then takes his father to the edge of the Sea of Galilee, where six more slicker-clad men hoist his father, wheelchair and all, to the top of an old watchtower.
In ''Tochka,'' from this year, a group of men in blue clothes and white caps wheel a large rusty spool across the landscape, ultimately using it to construct a rickety footbridge over a small ravine that could easily be crossed without it. A medieval yet timeless mood prevails; the fragile predicament of Israel is enacted in terms that Bosch or Bruegel would recognize.
Operating in a more contemporary mode, Rona Yefman's ''Pippi at Abu-Dis'' (2008) shows a latter-day Pippi Longstocking (played by the performance artist Tanja Schlander) futilely but energetically trying to dismantle the towering Abu-Dis wall that divides Israel from the Palestinian territories. In the similarly seemingly improvised ''2 Flags,'' a battle to the death between two fairly hapless gangs -- the Hoods and the Stripes -- on the streets, rooftops and beaches of Tel Aviv. A result is a loopy mixture of fact and slapstick that brings together ninjas, nerds and several elders, including two who recall evading the Nazis in Poland.
And Deville Cohen backs up his impressive contribution to ''Greater New York'' with ''The Wall,'' another video mixture of performance, installation and appropriation dominated by large grisaille photocopies, this time of buildings and brick walls. A group of actors -- whose faces are covered and whose genders are ambiguous -- change outfits, introduce brightly colored objects and interact with their flimsy setting. It is as if some avant-garde troupe of performance artists has been relegated to dressing store windows and is making the best of it.
These last three works, expanding on ideas generally at large in the art-world atmosphere, are by artists who just happen to be Israeli.
''The Young Israelis'' is on view though Saturday at the Lesley Heller Workspace, 54 Orchard Street, near Grand Street, Lower East Side; (212) 410-6120, lesleyheller.com.

HEADLINE: Dollar Hits Low Against Yen, Dealing Blow to Japan's Economy

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The dollar sank to a 15-year low against the yen on Wednesday, as the Federal Reserve's pessimistic view of the American economy prompted investors to sell the American currency for safer assets.
The strengthening yen comes as a further blow to a Japanese economy that is suffering the effects of deflation.
The dollar, which has declined more than 10 percent against the yen in the last three months, dropped to 84.72 yen on the Electronic Brokering Services trading platform late Wednesday -- the lowest level since April 1995, when the dollar hit a low of 79.75 yen in the aftermath of the 1985 Plaza Accords, the coordinated effort between major economies to depreciate the dollar. 
In Japan, the dollar's decline has ignited fears that too strong of a domestic currency could harm the country's recovery, led by exporters like Toyota.
The yen tends to strengthen against other currencies despite a weak economy at home because Japan still runs a current-account surplus, making a run on the currency unlikely.
The yen's strength has also fueled speculation that the Japanese government may intervene to weaken its currency. A strong yen hurts Japanese exporters by making their goods more expensive overseas and by eroding the value of their repatriated earnings. Japanese officials have held off suggesting that an currency intervention is in the works -- a maneuver Tokyo has avoided since March 2004.
On Wednesday, the Japanese finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said he was ''closely watching'' currency markets.
Indeed, many analysts do not expect Japan to intervene. To be effective, such intervention requires international coordination; moreover, Tokyo has supported Washington's efforts to pressure China to let its currency appreciate, as part of a commitment among the world's largest economies to let market forces determine currency levels.
With intervention unlikely, the onus has fallen on the Bank of Japan to shore up the country's faltering economy. The dollar-yen exchange rate is closely correlated with the spread, or difference, between interest rates in the United States and Japan, so by lowering interest rates in Japan, the central bank could help ease the upward pressure on the yen.
Pressure increased on the Bank of Japan to act after steps announced by Federal Reserve on Tuesday reinforced expectations that American interest rates would remain at record lows for some time. The Fed's plan to buy government debt drove down yields in the Treasury markets, narrowing the spread with Japan, which was a factor in the yen's spike on Wednesday.
But Japan's interest rates are already near zero, limiting the central bank's policy options. The bank also maintains that the economy is ''gradually recovering,'' making it difficult for policy makers to justify further monetary easing. At the end of a policy meeting on Tuesday, the bank announced it would leave monetary policy unchanged.
''The yen has appreciated to the level at which the B.O.J. has taken actions in the past,'' Yunosuke Ikeda, a strategist for Nomura, wrote Wednesday in a research note. ''However, we see no sign that the B.O.J. is very concerned about the economy's downside risks.''
''We believe it is unlikely that the B.O.J. would take additional easing steps any time soon,'' Mr. Ikeda said, but added that the central bank could get more serious about taking action if the Japanese currency were to hit levels closer to 82 yen to the dollar.

HEADLINE: China's Economy, While Still Surging, Begins Showing Signs of Moderation

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- In the latest signs that the Chinese economy is beginning to cool after setting a torrid pace in the first half of this year, several government indicators slowed slightly last month, Beijing announced on Wednesday.
The July indicators for industrial output, retail sales, fixed-asset investment and bank lending all provided a fairly consistent snapshot of a country where economic growth remains the strongest in the world, but where the nearly manic spending of the last few months is starting to fade.
A gradual slackening in retail sales and fixed-asset investment last month, together with a weakening of imports that was announced on Tuesday, pointed to more caution by consumers and investors alike in China. Exports continue to surge, creating the prospect that China may once again rely on foreign buyers to sustain rapid economic growth and limit unemployment. 
The moderation in China's economic growth is no accident. A series of government policies, as varied as limits on bank loans and restrictions on real estate investments, have been aimed at preventing the economy from overheating, which could fan inflation.
But an imbalance in China between strong exports and weakening domestic demand could rekindle trade tensions with industrialized and developing countries, economists said. Unemployment remains a problem in many other countries, not just the United States, that find themselves buying ever more from China.
Particularly unexpected in the data on Wednesday was the restraint that Chinese banks showed in issuing new loans, which in turn contributed to slower growth in the money supply. Banks issued 533 billion renminbi ($78.7 billion) in new loans last month, down from 603.4 billion renminbi ($89.1 billion) in June.
A broad measure of money supply, M2, rose 17.6 percent in July compared with a year earlier after being up 18.5 percent in June.
''We believe this level of broad money supply growth is clearly too restrictive, as it will put more downward pressure on domestic demand growth in the near future,'' two Goldman Sachs economists, Yu Song and Helen Qiao, wrote in a research note.
The gradual slowing in China is evident in the factories that have turned the country into the manufacturing center of the world. Industrial output rose 13.4 percent last month compared with the same month last year.
By comparison, industrial output had been up 13.7 percent in June from a year earlier, after rising 16.5 percent in May.
Much the same pattern was evident in fixed-asset investment, which was up 24.9 percent last month compared with a year earlier. It had been ahead by 25.5 percent in June.
Retail sales rose 17.9 percent in July compared with the same month last year, as Chinese consumers with rising wages continued to flock to stores. But sales had grown 18.3 percent in June compared with a year earlier, and had been up 18.7 percent in May.
Chinese policy makers have long feared that inflation could lead to social unrest, and have tailored many policies to prevent it. Consumer prices were up 3.3 percent in July from a year earlier, accelerating from an increase of 2.9 percent in June.
But there were signs that inflation could begin to moderate. Producer prices were 4.8 percent higher in July than a year ago, after being up 6.4 percent in June and 7.1 percent in May.
Many businesses are complaining about rising costs, which may hurt their willingness to invest. Alex Yu, a senior manager at the Dongguan Jet Power Metals and Plastics Factory in Dongguan, China, said that wages had climbed 20 to 30 percent in the last year while the cost of an indispensable kind of raw plastic had soared 23 percent.
''Everything is getting more and more expensive, we feel the impact of inflation in all areas of our business,'' he said.
On Tuesday, China's General Administration of Customs announced that the country's trade surplus reached $28.7 billion last month, the highest level since January 2009.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who has repeatedly called for a more confrontational trade strategy toward China, said in a statement late Tuesday that China's latest trade numbers ''show just how little motive China has to end its currency manipulation unless it is pushed to do so.''

HEADLINE: Blaming a Slow Recovery, the Bank of England Trims Its Economic Forecast

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER and HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
The Bank of England cut its economic growth forecast Wednesday, in part blaming the uncertain pace of the recovery in the United States and the rest of Europe.
Meanwhile, the dollar fell to a 15-year low against the yen, contributing to a sharp sell-off of stocks in Tokyo.
The central bank in Britain now forecasts annual growth to peak at 3 percent, less than the 3.6 percent it had predicted in May. It also said inflation would remain above the bank's 2 percent target until the end of next year, longer than previously predicted, before falling below the target in 2012. 
The Bank of England cited uncertainty about the United States recovery among its reasons for cutting its forecast for British economic growth. Banks are being slow to increase lending as they find it difficult to raise financing themselves. Planned austerity programs in Britain and the Continent, Britain's top trading partner, have further dimmed the economic outlook.
The Bank of England held its benchmark interest rate at the record low of 0.5 percent last week and kept a $:200 billion ($313 billion) stimulus package unchanged.
''There are clearly risks,'' Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, said Wednesday, hinting that the central bank might consider expanding its stimulus package to support the economy. ''Business and consumer sentiment have shown signs of softening, measures of financial fragility remain elevated and there is great uncertainty about the outlook for both the U.S. and our most important trading partner, the euro area.''
The recovery in the United States has run into trouble, economists say, because a lack of confidence keeps consumers and businesses from stepping in where government stimulus packages left off.
''At this point policy makers should have reinstated confidence,'' said Karen Ward, senior global economist at HSBC in London, ''but the private sector isn't taking up the baton in a way we'd hoped.''
While the United States trade deficit widened 18.8 percent in June, as exports fell during the month and imports grew, many analysts said the global economy could no longer count on American consumers to serve as the primary engine of growth. And it is not clear if China is prepared to step into the breach. The latest developments there indicate that the efforts of policy makers in Beijing to restrain lending are beginning to pay off. But some experts worry they might have gone too far.
The announcement from London came a day after the Federal Reserve said it would use the proceeds from its huge mortgage-bond portfolio to buy long-term Treasury securities in a bid to support the faltering economy. The action is intended to keep long-term interest rates down and to stimulate borrowing. But it caught some traders off guard.
''It actually shakes confidence and raises questions about the future,'' said Joe Battipaglia, a market strategist at Stifel Nicolaus in New York.
Stock markets retreated Wednesday in a wave that swept across the globe. The Nikkei index fell by 2.7 percent; the Eurostoxx 50 index of blue chips closed down 2.6 percent; and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 2.82 percent.
For now, it is unlikely that the Bank of England or the European Central Bank will take similar actions to the Fed's. But at least in Britain, the central bank is more likely to revert to asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, than raising interest rates, said Howard Archer, chief economist for Britain and Europe at IHS Global Insight in London.
The Fed's downgrade of its view of the American economy also prompted investors to sell the dollar on expectations that interest rates would remain low well into next year, making it less desirable for foreigners to hold American debt. After declining more than 10 percent against the yen in the last three months, the dollar dropped to 84.72 yen on Wednesday, the lowest level since April 1995.
In Japan, the dollar's decline has ignited fears that too strong of a domestic currency could harm the country's recovery, led by exporters like Toyota. It has also fed speculation that the Japanese government might intervene to weaken its currency. A strong yen hurts Japanese exporters by making their goods more expensive overseas and by eroding the value of their repatriated earnings.
On Wednesday, the Japanese finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said he was ''closely watching'' currency markets.

HEADLINE: At a Top New York School, Questions About Diversity

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Diversity Debate Convulses Elite High School'' (front page, Aug. 5), about the dwindling minority enrollment at Hunter College High School in Manhattan: The article's reference to the ''longstanding disagreement between much of the high school faculty and the administration of Hunter College'' implies a clear line between two unyielding sides. In fact, the high school faculty is not of one voice on the issue of the qualifying exam, which remains a subject of healthy debate. 
What is inarguable is the success of the test as an indicator of future academic and professional achievement. We are proud to offer an incomparable education, at no charge, to so many students who catapult that education into outstanding futures -- including Justin Hudson, the graduation speaker quoted in the article, who is off to the Ivy League.
Finally, as someone who has dedicated 24 years to Hunter College High School, I can say unequivocally that the school has received more personal, financial and motivational support under the administration of Jennifer Raab, the president of Hunter College, than at any other time in its history.
Sonya G. Mosco Deputy Director Hunter College Campus Schools New York, Aug. 5, 2010
To the Editor:
There is something seriously wrong when an elite high school is being taken to task for maintaining its high academic standards as opposed to the continual ''dumbing down'' of achievement levels so prevalent in the rest of the educational establishment.
Political correctness is trumping achievement. No wonder the United States is falling behind in math and science. We simply do not require excellence in the public sector. Mediocrity will always seek the lowest level, and that is where our educational system has been heading.
While it is surely true that economic circumstances play a role, perhaps substantial, in academic success, placing a high value on education is the key. When the pandering stops and children are challenged, they will rise to the occasion.
Hunter College High School deserves the highest praise. If minorities are now underrepresented, it becomes a challenge to them to raise their own standards, to put in the effort. Lowering the standards for others does nothing but compromise proven, and much needed, educational excellence.

HEADLINE: JetBlue's Response to a Fed-Up Employee's Exit

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE marketers and image-makers of Madison Avenue are asking each other, ''What would you do if you were JetBlue?''
The question is, of course, prompted by the incident on Monday at John F. Kennedy International Airport when, after a dispute with a passenger, Steven Slater, a longtime flight attendant on JetBlue Airways, used the emergency chute to leave a plane that had arrived from Pittsburgh.
Mr. Slater's swift slide to fame is being called an object lesson in the difficulties of flying today, a symbol of the dislocations in the workplace caused by the economy and even the arrival of a real-life version of the sassy character Johnny, played by Stephen Stucker, in the 1980 movie ''Airplane.'' 
''This is a symptom of a much larger problem,'' said Michael Watras, president and chief executive at Straightline International, a branding consultancy in New York.
''The airlines need to say, 'We hear you, we feel this, and we're here not just to get you from Point A to Point B but to treat you with respect,' '' he added.
The publicity generated by the incident has been enormous, offering JetBlue a chance to take advantage of the attention to communicate in unique ways with potential and current customers.
But for the first 48 hours, JetBlue said nothing about the matter, an unusual course of action -- or inaction -- for a company known for skillfully cultivating the public through social media like blogs, Facebook and Twitter.
''What not to do is to stay silent,'' said Michael Levine, the author of books like ''Guerrilla P.R.'' and ''Guerrilla P.R. 2.0.'' ''Don't do nothing.''
''This is a teachable moment'' for JetBlue, Mr. Levine said, ''to try to create context for what happened.''
For instance, he said that the airline could say something along these lines: ''We understand that travel today is not always a luxury experience. We at JetBlue are trying to do everything we can for your safety.''
Conor Brady, chief creative officer at Organic in New York, a digital agency owned by the Omnicom Group, said it was ''disappointing'' that JetBlue did not immediately reach out.
Because ''JetBlue is one of those brands that has a little bit of rebel in it,'' Mr. Brady said, executives could have addressed the matter soon after it happened rather than let ''corporate lawyers'' silence them.
On Wednesday afternoon, the JetBlue blog BlueTales offered the company's initial official comments. A post that carried the headline ''Sometimes the weird news is about us ...'' did not mention Mr. Slater by name; rather, it slyly asked, ''Perhaps you heard a little story about one of our flight attendants?''
''While we can't discuss the details of what is an ongoing investigation,'' the post continued, ''plenty of others have already formed opinions on the matter. Like, the entire Internet.''
The post concluded with a reference to the 1999 movie ''Office Space,'' which mocks work life in corporate America, and a salute to JetBlue's ''fantastic, awesome and professional in-flight crew members for delivering the JetBlue experience you've come to expect of us.''
That JetBlue finally weighed in may be why comments online about the company grew more positive on Wednesday, according to Zeta Interactive, a digital marketing agency in New York, after turning sharply negative on Tuesday.
The tone of comments about JetBlue, as elicited by the Zeta Buzz online media mining technology, was 70 percent positive and 30 percent negative on Wednesday, Zeta reported, compared with 59 percent positive and 41 percent negative on Tuesday.
From the beginning of the year through Monday, Zeta said, the comments about JetBlue were 79 percent positive and 21 percent negative.
Comments about Mr. Slater were far more complimentary than those about JetBlue, according to Zeta, at 93 percent positive and 7 percent negative.
The positive figure was higher than Zeta found for the New Orleans Saints after they won Super Bowl XLIV, at 90 percent, and even exceeded by a percentage point the positive rating for Chesley B. Sullenberger III, who successfully landed a US Airways flight on the Hudson River in January 2009.
Even so, it makes sense for JetBlue to ''stay away from'' Mr. Slater, said Steven Thibodeau, chief digital officer at Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners in New York, part of MDC Partners.
''Let popular culture put this guy on a throne or crucify him,'' Mr. Thibodeau said, adding that it was more important for JetBlue to ''take the high ground'' and focus on issues like its passenger safety record.
JetBlue ''could have come out sooner'' with its comments, Mr. Thibodeau said, because its executives responsible for corporate communications, public relations and customer service ought to have made contingency plans for an incident like Monday's.
''They're probably more prepared for a plane to land on the Hudson than for something like this,'' he added.
Steve Rubel, senior vice president and director for insights at the Edelman Digital unit of Edelman in New York, said he believed that JetBlue was ''doing the right thing'' in how it had been handling the matter.
''Despite the fact that the Slater story has clearly resonated with disgruntled workers everywhere,'' Mr. Rubel wrote in an e-mail, ''as best as I can tell it is starting to run its course.''
It was far less disruptive for JetBlue than ''the now-infamous 2007 Valentine's Day crisis,'' he said, referring to a snowstorm that stranded thousands of passengers, ''which was arguably one of the key events that encouraged the company to jump into engaging'' with consumers through the social media.
''JetBlue has built significant social trust equity'' since then, Mr. Rubel said. ''Therefore, in this particular case -- especially given how isolated the event was -- they don't need to do more than they need to at this stage. This might not be the case for others, however.''

HEADLINE: At FreshDirect, Reinvention After a Crisis

BYLINE: By JESSICA BRUDER

 BODY:
FreshDirect is an online grocer making more than 45,000 deliveries a week to customers throughout most of New York City and parts of Long Island, Westchester County, New Jersey and Connecticut.
THE CHALLENGE Surviving a major crisis -- an immigration audit that decimated the company's work force -- at a time when the company was hemorrhaging money and alienating customers because its basic business model was not working.
THE BACKGROUND When FreshDirect was founded in 1999 -- in those euphoric days before the Internet bubble burst -- the idea of an online grocer in New York City seemed promising. The company would not only sell just farm-fresh food, it would sell time and convenience, too.
FreshDirect started building its 300,000-square-foot headquarters and packing plant in 2000 in the Long Island City section of Queens and made its first deliveries two years later. But little went as planned. ''We broke too many eggs,'' said Richard S. Braddock, who would become the company's chairman in 2005 and its chief executive in 2008. ''We showed up with thawed ice cream. We bruised the produce. We delivered late. We missed boxes. We didn't remediate your service issues.'' 
During FreshDirect's formative years, the only thing that kept the company alive was its ability to churn through customers. A series of incentives for first-time buyers -- including a $50 discount on orders of $100 or more -- kept attracting newcomers, but most of them dropped the service after their discounts ran out.
Back then, according to Mr. Braddock, about 85 percent of the company's customers placed just one or two orders before giving up on the site. Revenue was on the rise, but profits did not follow. Inevitably, FreshDirect started running out of cash.
Against that bleak backdrop, a crisis struck at the end of 2007. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials announced plans to inspect the company's I-9 employment eligibility records.
On Dec. 9, the day before the audit was to begin, FreshDirect managers asked their employees to provide documents proving their eligibility to work in the United States. Many of the employees never returned. The few undocumented workers who did come back were fired. As a result, the company lost more than 200 employees, reducing its work force by 15 percent just before the winter holidays.
As FreshDirect limped into 2008, customers fumed about the many sold-out items and limited delivery options. The company sent a mass e-mail message that amounted to something of an understatement, ''This January, we're going to have a harder time meeting your food needs than we usually do.''
At that point, Mr. Braddock, who had been FreshDirect's chairman for more than two years, decided to take drastic action. A former chief executive of Priceline, he fired FreshDirect's chief executive and took the reins himself.
Both inside and outside the company, there was concern that if Mr. Braddock failed, FreshDirect would go the way of Webvan, an overly ambitious online grocer that also got its start in 1999.
Webvan had raised $1.2 billion from investors and expanded rapidly to cover 10 markets across the country -- but none of those markets ever turned a profit. Two years after it began, Webvan declared bankruptcy and ceased operations.
After that, it became conventional wisdom that online grocers simply could not succeed; among many industry observers, that sentiment persists.
THE OPTIONS After taking over, Mr. Braddock concluded that his only option was to hire employees to replenish his depleted work force and remake the company with a focus on customer service. ''It was either that or death,'' he said.
In a fundamental shift, Mr. Braddock decided to end the company's addiction to new customers. For two years, it simply stopped offering promotions to first-time buyers. And the new customers simply stopped coming. The danger, of course, was that the old customers would continue to exit, revenue would decline and the company would run out of money.
Internally, managers disagreed over whether the strategy, the business equivalent of a tourniquet, could work. But Mr. Braddock insisted that it did not make sense to bring in new customers until the company figured out how to serve them. ''The trick in this business isn't to acquire new customers,'' he explained, ''it's to make them loyal.''
To strengthen customer service, Mr. Braddock asserted, FreshDirect needed a system of continuous feedback, a real-time database that would follow every step -- and misstep -- of each business day, so that minor gaffes could be resolved before they turned into big problems.
The software would have to track plant operations, along with data corresponding to some 150,000 active customers and more than 8,500 products. It would take FreshDirect two years to build the database internally.
Today, if a truck goes out 15 minutes late or if a container of jalapeno hummus is left off an order, the problem can be traced to its source. Also, the real-time data reports allow FreshDirect to shift its resources to areas of customer demand, beefing up capacity based on the popularity of delivery zones and time slots, anticipating which products might sell out and stocking up on them in advance.
In another move that was internally contentious, FreshDirect introduced a rating system for its own produce and seafood. Every morning, managers and buyers in both departments rank their products from one star (''below average'') to five (''never better''). The system aims to simulate the in-store shopping experience, allowing the grocers to showcase their best stuff and customers to decide what looks good.
But the strategy came with a big risk: to gain customers' trust, FreshDirect would have to acknowledge that not every item it stocked was picture perfect every day. Once again, not everyone at the company was enthusiastic about the idea. ''Was it scary? Yeah!'' recalled Glenn Walsh, the produce manager. ''I thought it was insane in the beginning.''
Mr. Braddock also decided to upgrade FreshDirect's Web site, using the company's internal database to profile customers and serve a customized online experience.
For example, the site's software can now analyze order patterns, reminding customers of their favorite products and suggesting other items they might like, a marketing tool that has worked well for Netflix and Amazon. In addition, the database recognizes whether a visiting customer is a new, infrequent, lapsed or loyal customer -- and serves appropriate messages and ads.
WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY FreshDirect's strategy drew these comments from experts on retailing and marketing:
John A. Deighton, a professor at Harvard Business School who specializes in consumer behavior and digital marketing:
''Great execution seldom saves a flawed concept. There's no shortage of cases to learn from. Consider Webvan, HomeGrocer, NetGrocer, Streamline, Homeruns, WebHouse and Peapod. The pain point for each one of them has been getting groceries to customers' homes.''
Stew Leonard Jr., president and chief executive of Stew Leonard's, a family-owned chain of food stores and wine shops in Connecticut and New York:
''When you go to buy something on the FreshDirect Web site and it recommends another item? I think that's a brilliant idea. I wish I could do that in the store.''
Gabriel Shaoolian, chief executive and founder of Blue Fountain Media, a Web site design and online marketing company in New York:
''FreshDirect has a great chance to create what we call a stickiness factor, adding features that bring people to their site on a more frequent basis. They need to integrate social media marketing, give people the opportunity to tweet about certain items or post them to Facebook.''
THE RESULTS At nytimes.com/boss, you can offer your own thoughts on Mr. Braddock's strategy. Next week, on the blog and in this space, we will tell you how things have worked out for FreshDirect.

HEADLINE: Concern Over Centrists As G.O.P. Leans Right

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Republican field is nearly set in Congressional races, with primaries across the country producing a lineup of candidates that has steadily tilted to the right, a shift that is altering the dynamic -- but not necessarily the outcome -- of the midterm elections.
The slate of general election prospects includes fewer moderate Republicans than party leaders had imagined when they began recruiting candidates a year ago, and more backed by the Tea Party movement. 
The results leave Republicans facing a critical question heading into the general election: Can the added enthusiasm of their conservative base for the insurgent candidates offset a potential loss of appeal to independent and centrist voters?
Senate primaries in Colorado and Connecticut on Tuesday, where the preferred choices of the Republican establishment lost, have given fresh hope to Democrats that Republicans may not be able to fully capitalize on a favorable political environment.
Yet the primary outcomes have done little to change one dynamic: the climate for Democrats remains difficult, with the economy slowing and the unemployment rate showing little sign that it will improve significantly before Election Day. That sentiment eases any worry Republicans may otherwise have about some of their new candidates.
''I still believe that this will be largely a referendum on the administration's policies,'' said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ''Recent history has shown us that independent voters are flocking to Republicans. People see a need for checks and balances.''
The midterm election season, even more than previously assumed, is shaping up to be a contest that is dependent on the disaffected bases of both parties. If this was a presidential election year, Republicans concede they would be nervous about a shift to the right, but in a midterm election, where the turnout is traditionally lower, the enthusiasm in the conservative base could be more effective than efforts to appeal to the middle.
''We will find out in November,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said in an interview on Wednesday. ''The primaries were going to sort themselves out one way or the other. I think it is perfectly clear that you cannot control the outcome of all these primaries from somewhere else.''
While he and other Republicans anticipate substantial gains in November, Mr. McConnell said Republicans needed to keep their expectations in check. ''It would take an almost perfect day to get the Senate back,'' he said. ''I think we are going to have a good day, but I do worry about irrational exuberance.''
Several Republicans said they were more concerned about the quality of the campaigns than the candidates. Republican officials have moved to swiftly fortify the operations of the new candidates, hoping to compete with what they perceive as well-established Democratic organizations.
While a handful of Democrats have faced competitive Senate primaries, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who left the Republican Party a year ago, is the only high-profile incumbent who has been defeated. Other Democrats have arguably emerged from their tests in a stronger position. Among those is Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who on Tuesday defeated Andrew Romanoff, a former speaker of the Colorado House, with the help of the White House.
Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said the Colorado Senate race provided something of a test run for the White House to see whether voters who supported President Obama in 2008 would return to support his candidates in 2010. That is one critical way, he said, for Democrats to compete with a Republican enthusiasm advantage.
''There's energy in the Tea Party,'' Mr. Kaine said. ''That's one thing we have to pay attention to.''
The turnout in the Colorado primary provided the latest fact to justify this concern: more Republican voters went to the polls than Democrats -- by a count of 68,404.
But in Colorado and Connecticut, Florida and Kentucky, Nevada and Utah, the Republican Senate candidates preferred by party leaders in Washington did not survive challenges from within their parties. Several Republican nominees have made missteps and gaffes, adding to the unpredictability of the election year.
Sharron Angle of Nevada, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Linda McMahon of Connecticut have all struggled with their high-profile political roles. (Ms. McMahon still finds herself fielding questions about her career as a professional wrestling executive; a video has been circulating of her kicking an employee in the crotch.)
Ken Buck of Colorado, a district attorney and favorite of the Tea Party, on Tuesday became the year's sixth Republican Senate nominee who was not the top choice of party leaders. He has argued that the separation of church and state in the United States was too strict and he has called for eliminating the Education and Energy Departments.
Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said that Republicans had nominated a string of candidates ''who are more concerned with imposing a strict social doctrine than with growing the economy.''
Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, has supported his own slate of candidates aligned with the conservative agenda. He directed tens of thousands of dollars from his political action committee to the Buck campaign. And he has dismissed the controversial comments from candidates, including Mr. Buck, who urged voters to support him over his female opponent because ''I do not wear high heels.''
''Americans are rejecting the failed liberal agenda, so all Democrats can do is try to manufacture controversy over a few comments,'' Mr. DeMint said Wednesday. ''But voters aren't fooled.''

HEADLINE: Scaling Down, to $2 a Square Foot

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

 BODY:
BOZEMAN, Mont.
FOR years Eldon and Bruce Leep, father and son contractors, built condominiums at the very high end of the market in the cluster of affluent ski villages near here at the foot of Lone Mountain.
But there were clouds looming in Big Sky country. ''They were selling faster than we could build them,'' Bruce Leep said. ''Then we noticed one day that we were five units ahead, and then eight or nine.'' The slowdown worsened, and soon the jobs stopped. The change put 40 employees of the Leeps' company, Envirocontrol Systems, out of work.
High-end home contractors in southwest Montana, near Yellowstone Park, have been as battered by the recession as those elsewhere in the country. Accustomed to putting up lavish mansions of native stone and logs for wealthy clients, many have folded, moved or gone down-market, remodeling homes or building ones costing $200,000 to $300,000.
For a time, the Leeps did a little of everything. ''We were struggling to survive,'' Bruce Leep said. ''We traveled wherever we had to, concrete work for oil projects in North Dakota and even handyman projects.'' When a storm with baseball-size hail walloped the region in June, they and other contractors got some welcome jobs putting in new roofs and siding. 
All the while, however, the Leeps were hunting for a permanent line of business, something to sustain their 20-year-old family firm. Their choice was portable housing -- still housing, but as far from their old work as could be. Instead of building homes with a labyrinth of rooms that cost $1,500 to $1,800 a square foot, they decided to construct one-room houses priced at about $20 a square foot. Such homes are basically shells to which owners can add baths and kitchens if they wish; some may even have lofts and high ceilings. Typically, the houses can be assembled with little labor in a few hours.
The Leeps and their partners have great hopes for their new work. The potential market, they say, includes the third world, where housing is scarce; disaster areas, where people may be displaced; and the homeless population. The recession and major events like the Haiti earthquake have bumped up interest in economical portable houses, which, they add, can also be used as ice fishing shacks, hunters' shelters, temporary offices and the like.
''We were excited because it was something different,'' Bruce Leep said. ''We were burned out on construction, with its big ups and downs, and this would provide some stability, we hope.''
In 2008, while repairing his roof, the Leeps met Bob Sterling, an architect with an idea for a portable house. They also met Ronald Omyonga, a Kenyan engineer on a mission to house the slum dwellers around Nairobi, who live under tarps. That team soon developed a one-room structure that is 118 square feet and shaped like a single cell of a honeycomb. It is made of high-density polypropylene panels that attach to a lightweight, high-density aluminum frame.
''The shape seems simple,'' Bruce Leep said. ''But very precise dimensioning is required. It was difficult to figure out how all of these angles come together.''
But even with a sound design, the project soon languished. The recession was wearing on, and the Leeps simply ran out of money -- to the point where even the heat in their shop was turned off.
Then, six months ago, the Leeps met Michael Weas, another refugee from the high-end home market. Mr. Weas had sold a software company to become a developer in Bozeman, and had built two spec homes at the Yellowstone Club, an affluent ski village, one for $3.5 million and one for $4.5 million. ''Then one day I woke up, and the handwriting was on the wall,'' Mr. Weas said. ''Real estate was over.''
But Mr. Weas is excited now by portable housing. After a single meeting with the Leeps, he and several partners assembled the funds the Leeps needed. Earlier this year, the group founded a company called HabiHut, after the honeycomb home the team had designed.
The HabiHut weighs about 400 pounds, packs down to a 4-foot-by-8-foot crate, and costs $2,500, which includes shipping with bulk orders. It can be assembled in an hour or two with just a screwdriver, will last up to 15 years, and can be combined with other HabiHuts as a family expands or other needs arise.
For a small structure, the HabiHut contains some surprises. It has a roomy 14-foot ceiling, for one, and the white panels are translucent, giving the cozy home a light, airy feel.
For the Leeps and their partners, HabiHut is a strange new world. Money is the major difference -- ''We used to build houses that would buy a village for 20,000 people,'' Mr. Weas said with a laugh -- but the marketing is different, too.
''I'm not really selling myself to a customer, which I was doing when I was building their home,'' Bruce Leep said. ''The product pretty much sells itself.''
Moreover, HabiHut has two dimensions. ''It's a project about providing shelter, but hopefully we can make money and create jobs,'' said Mr. Weas, whose son Sean, a recent master's graduate in architecture, is also involved in the venture. ''The best of both worlds. There's a moral aspect to it that wasn't there at the Yellowstone Club.''
The first few dozen HabiHuts have been manufactured, with several in use in Kenya, two in Haiti and another 20 en route to Haiti for sale. HabiHuts are also being tested as water kiosks -- a place where villagers can fill water jugs with clean water -- by Umande, a Kenyan organization that helps the homeless, and one is functioning as a restroom at a trailhead in Montana.
The Leeps' venture is just one of several developments in the portable-housing industry.
There has been a surge of interest lately, prompted by the earthquake in Haiti and other events, in designing even cheaper and more portable structures. One new model, the elegant Abod house, is being built by BSB Design of West Des Moines for single mothers in the shanties of Soweto, South Africa. The homes employ the strong shape of the inverted catenary arch -- the shape of the St. Louis arch -- so two children can sleep in a loft while the mother sleeps below. The 120-square-foot homes are made of corrugated metal; the frame stands on concrete or recycled rubber mats.
''It can be erected by one family in one day,'' said Douglas Sharp, the designer. ''Four women put the first one up in four hours.'' The homes cost $4,900 apiece, or $3,500 each for orders of 50 or more.
On another front, California, facing growing homelessness, adopted a law in 2008 requiring cities and towns to make land available for emergency shelters. Since then World Shelters, a nonprofit group in Arcata, has seen demand grow for its U-Dome, a geodesic structure made of polypropylene panels. River Haven, a homeless camp in Ventura County, now has 19 U-Domes in use, including one with communal showers and a toilet.
The U-Dome 200 is 195 square feet, 10 feet tall and configured with a single bed, though two could fit. It costs $2,750 for individuals and $1,825 for humanitarian groups. World Shelters makes other shelters, including the new TranShel, a 192-square-foot rectangular modular home costing $500 that is aimed at the emergency market for displaced people.
Like the Leeps, World Shelters welcomes individual buyers; one is Caren Wise, a psychotherapist from Hoopa, Calif., who lived in a U-Dome 200 while she built her home in Northern California.
''I loved it,'' Ms. Wise said. ''It was a house in a box. It came and I put it up in four hours. I had a little kitchen, a bed, a wood stove and an old claw-foot bathtub.''
Ms. Wise lived there with her dog, Dexter, but she said, laughing, that two people could live in the U-Dome 200 ''if they got along.''
She now uses the dome as a studio and a guesthouse.
Meanwhile, the Leeps are now working on a grand vision -- a village of HabiHuts. The company wants to raise $200,000 to build a community for the people of the Vumilia tent camp in Gilgil, Kenya, who have been displaced by violence. The village will have 50 HabiHuts, two water kiosks, three sanitation kiosks, a cellphone charging station and a $15,000, three-kilowatt solar dish. In the United States, that dish would power just one 3,500-square-foot home.
The $200,000 cost even includes shipping. ''That's everything you need,'' Sean Weas said. ''The solar dish, the water, sanitation and shelter.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 19, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article and a headline last Thursday about portable housing misstated the price per square foot of one model, the HabiHut. It is $20, not $2. The article also referred imprecisely to the terms of a 2008 California housing law. While the law requires municipalities to set aside land for emergency shelters for the homeless, it does not extend to homeless encampments.

HEADLINE: Farmers and Activists Move Toward a Truce on Animals' Close Quarters

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
WEST MANSFIELD, Ohio -- Concessions by farmers in this state to sharply restrict the close confinement of hens, hogs and veal calves are the latest sign that so-called factory farming -- a staple of modern agriculture that is seen by critics as inhumane and a threat to the environment and health -- is on the verge of significant change.
A recent agreement between farmers and animal rights activists here is a rare compromise in the bitter and growing debate over large-scale, intensive methods of producing eggs and meat, and may well push farmers in other states to give ground, experts say. The rising consumer preference for more ''natural'' and local products and concerns about pollution and antibiotic use in giant livestock operations are also driving change.
The surprise truce in Ohio follows stronger limits imposed by California voters in 2008; there, extreme caging methods will be banned altogether by 2015. In another sign of the growing clout of the animal welfare movement, a law passed in California this year will also ban imports from other states of eggs produced in crowded cages. Similar limits were approved last year in Michigan and less sweeping restrictions have been adopted in Florida, Arizona and other states. 
Hoping to avoid a divisive November referendum that some farmers feared they would lose, Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio urged farm leaders to negotiate with opponents, led by the Humane Society of the United States. After secret negotiations, the sides agreed to bar new construction of egg farms that pack birds in cages, and to phase out the tight caging of pregnant sows within 15 years and of veal calves by 2017.
Farmers in Ohio have accepted the agreement with chagrin, saying they sense that they must bend with the political and cultural winds. Tim Weaver, whose grandparents started selling eggs in the early 20th century, is proud of his state-of-the art facilities, where four million birds produce more than three million eggs a day. In just one typical barn here at his Heartland Quality Egg Farm, 268,000 small white hens live in cages about the size of an open newspaper, six or seven to a cage.
Mr. Weaver said that after his initial shock at the agreement, he has accepted it as necessary. He will not be immediately affected since it allows existing egg farms to continue but bars new ones with similar cages. He defends his methods, saying, ''My own belief is that I'm doing the right thing.''
Egg production is at the center of the debate because more than 90 percent of the country's eggs are now produced in the stacked rows of cages that critics call inhumane.
Ohio is the country's second-largest egg producer, after Iowa. In the modern version of an egg barn, hordes of hens live with computer-controlled air circulation, lighting and feeding, their droppings whisked away by conveyor belt for recycling as fertilizer. As the hens jostle one other, their eggs roll onto a belt to be washed, graded and packed without ever being touched by human hands.
Mr. Weaver insists that his chickens are content and less prone to disease than those in barnyard flocks, saying, ''If our chickens aren't healthy and happy, they won't be as productive.''
Keeping chickens in cages is cruel and unnecessary, counter advocates like Wayne Pacelle, chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States, which has played a central role in the state-by-state battles. ''Animals that are built to move should be allowed to move,'' he said in an interview, and for chickens that means space for dust-bathing, perching and nesting.
The assertion that animals must be ''happy'' to be productive is not accurate, Mr. Pacelle added, pointing to abnormal behaviors like head waving or bar-biting and to a loss of bone density in confined animals.
In the mid-20th century, developments in animal nutrition and farm technologies as well as economic competition spurred the emergence of large-scale farms, often driving out small farmers who could not afford the large capital investments or survive the lower prices.
Now, the United Egg Producers, a national trade group, says that egg prices would rise by 25 percent if all eggs were produced by uncaged hens, putting stress on consumers and school lunch programs. Animal proponents say that better noncage methods could be developed and that price is not the ultimate issue anyway.
The American Veal Association, under pressure from consumers, agreed in 2007 to phase out the close confinement of calves by 2017. The requirement in the California law and the Ohio agreement to phase out the use of ''gestation crates'' on hog farms will have much wider effects.
The family of Irv Bell, 64, has been growing hogs in Zanesville, Ohio, since the 19th century. Where males and females were once put into a pen to mate, sows are now inseminated artificially and most are kept through their pregnancy in a 2-by-7-foot crate, in which they can lie down but not turn.
''I work with the hogs every day, and I don't think there is anything wrong with gestation crates,'' he said. ''But I have to be aware of things on the horizon, the bigger things at work.''
Formally, the new Ohio agreement only makes recommendations to a state livestock standards board, and getting opponents to recognize the authority of that board was an important achievement, said Keith Stimpert, a senior vice president of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation. ''We all know change is coming,'' Mr. Stimpert said, adding that farmers would also respond to demands by consumers and restaurants for free-range products.
''But is this how we're going to deal with these issues, on a state-by-state basis?'' he asked. That timetables and rules differ among states is going to cause economic harm, he said.
The Humane Society of the United States, for its part, is already picking new targets. The advocates have the most leverage, Mr. Pacelle said, in the states that permit referendums. He said that the issues were likely to be pressed in Washington and Oregon. Winning concessions may be harder, he acknowledged, in states without referendums, including Iowa and the South.
Meanwhile, a new dispute over chicken cages is already brewing in California. The breakthrough 2008 law said that animals could be confined only in ways that allowed them ''to lie down, stand up, fully extend their limbs and turn around freely.'' Egg producers and even some animal advocates say this may permit housing hens in larger ''enriched cages,'' with perches and nesting spots.
Mr. Pacelle asserts that no form of caging can meet a chicken's needs for ''running, flying and wing flapping'' and that denying these impulses can cause a rise in stress hormones.
''There's going to be a legal wrangle over this,'' Mr. Pacelle predicted.

HEADLINE: U.S. Exports Faltered in June; Trade Deficit Widened

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
American exports faltered in June even as imports hit a record high, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, pushing the United States trade deficit to its highest level in 20 months. 
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit jumped 18.8 percent in June compared with May, widening to $49.9 billion. The wider deficit came as a surprise to economists who had forecast a smaller trade gap because of lower global oil prices.
American exports slipped 1.3 percent, to $150.5 billion. Sales of American farm products, computers and telecommunications equipment all declined. Imports rose 3 percent, to $200.3 billion. Imports of consumer goods, in particular, surged to a record high as shipments of cellphones, household appliances, televisions and clothing all increased.
The drop in exports represents a setback for manufacturers and for President Obama, who has made the doubling of exports in the next five years a priority, saying that the increase would support two million jobs.
The deficit in goods and services, the difference between what America sells abroad and what the country imports, rose to the highest level since October 2008, when it stood at $59.4 billion.
Through the first six months of this year, the trade deficit is running at an annual rate of $494.9 billion. That is up 32 percent from the $374.9 billion deficit for all of 2009 -- a year when the deficit was cut nearly in half as a result of the recession. American manufacturers have enjoyed growing demand for their products in Asia. But they have faced weakness in Europe, where the economic rebound has been subdued by a debt crisis that erupted in the spring. Exports of electric generators, civilian aircraft and machine tools did buck the downward trend in June to post increases.
The wider deficit in June will most likely further depress overall American growth as measured by the gross domestic product in the April-to-June quarter. The Commerce Department initially estimated growth at 2.4 percent for the second quarter, but that figure will probably be revised lower now because of the wider trade deficit.
The prospects for exports have been hurt by a rise in value for the dollar against some foreign currencies. That includes the euro. And it is also affected by China's refusal to heed the Obama administration's demands that it allow its currency to rise in value against the dollar. A weaker dollar against China's renminbi would bolster the competitiveness of American products in China while making Chinese goods more expensive in America.
For June, the trade deficit with China rose 17.4 percent, to $26.2 billion. Through the first six months of this year, it is running 15.9 percent higher than a year ago. That is certain to increase pressure on Congress to pass legislation that would impose stiff economic sanctions on China unless it moves more quickly to allow its currency to rise in value.

HEADLINE: Profit Climbs at Cisco, but Sales Forecast Falls Below Expectations

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Cisco Systems, the computer networking equipment maker, reported stronger quarterly earnings on Wednesday as its customers continued to catch up on delayed purchases, but its chief executive said the company was seeing signs of the economic recovery slowing down. 
Shares in the company fell in after-hours trading Wednesday as revenue missed Wall Street expectations.
The Cisco chief executive, John T. Chambers, also offered a sales forecast for the new quarter that came in below expectations.
Cisco's sales are heavily dependent on capital spending at large corporations, phone companies and government agencies across the world, and an uncertain economy means those customers may spend less.
''We're seeing a large number of mixed signals,'' Mr. Chambers said. ''We think the words 'unusual uncertainty' are an accurate description of what's occurring.''
Cisco said both net income and revenue bounced back from last year's recessionary levels. Still, analysts were expecting even stronger results after a couple of quarters of Cisco exceeding its own expectations.
The company earned $1.9 billion, or 33 cents a share, in its fourth quarter, which ended July 31.
That was up 79 percent from $1.1 billion, or 19 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Revenue rose 27 percent, to $10.8 billion, just under analysts' forecasts of $10.9 billion. Cisco had projected revenue of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion. Revenue in the quarter a year earlier was $8.5 billion.
In extended trading after the release of the results, Cisco shares fell as much as $1.89, to $21.84. That came on top of regular-session losses of 58 cents to close at $23.73.
Excluding one-time charges and the cost of stock-based compensation, the company, based in San Jose, Calif., earned 43 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 42 cents, on average.
Mr. Chambers said he expected revenue in the current quarter to rise 18 to 20 percent from the same period a year earlier, which works out to $10.65 billion to $10.83 billion.
Analysts were expecting $10.95 billion, on average.

HEADLINE: The First Wave Of Weary Aides Heads for the Exits

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Linda Douglass slept nearly 12 hours the day after she left her job as a communications aide at the White House. And the day after that and the day after that. It took two weeks until she finally felt rested.
''I got to the point where I was almost traumatized by how hard I was working and how much stress I was feeling all the time,'' Ms. Douglass recalled. 
When she resigned, she said: ''I felt like a real burden was lifted from my shoulders. I was really surprised how exhausted I was when I left.''
Eighteen months into President Obama's term, some of the first-generation team that arrived with him at the White House are moving on. One by one, usually with little fanfare, they have turned in White House badges and BlackBerrys to rejoin the outside world, some eagerly seeking the exit, others unhappily shown the door.
Even in calmer times, the White House is a pressure cooker that can quickly burn out the most idealistic aides, but it may be even more so in an administration that inherited an economic collapse and two wars -- and then decided to overhaul the nation's health care system for good measure. Add to that the nonstop, partisan intensity of the e-mail-Internet-cable era, and it takes a toll.
In the last two weeks, Peter R. Orszag, the White House budget director, clocked his final day; Christina Romer, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, announced plans to return to California; and Camille Johnston, the first lady's communications director, accepted a high-level corporate job. They follow nearly a dozen others who have left since the inauguration.
''There should be more joy in government service, but it's really hard work,'' said Gregory B. Craig, who left as White House counsel after the first year. ''No matter what the job, each administration is different from the last administration, so everybody is learning the job from the beginning and there's enormous pressure to get it right.''
The departures are likely to accelerate after the midterm elections, a traditional time for turnover in any White House. Many in the West Wing wonder whether Rahm Emanuel, the high-octane chief of staff, will stay after the vote. He has said he wants to run for mayor of Chicago when Richard M. Daley steps down, and the two met privately in Chicago last week, but the mayor sounds as if he is running for re-election.
Colleagues also wonder about David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, who left his family in Chicago and regularly expresses distaste for Washington. But Mr. Axelrod just renewed his lease on a Washington apartment for another year, so he appears set until mid-2011, when he could leave to map out the re-election campaign.
''It's amazing and heartening given the marathon this team has sprinted over the last 18 months that turnover is as light as it is,'' said Stephanie Cutter, who left the White House to help her old boss, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, before his death, and then recently returned.
Some who left took other prestigious administration jobs. Don Gips, the presidential personnel director, became ambassador to South Africa. Norm Eisen, the White House ethics czar, has been nominated as ambassador to the Czech Republic.
Others left after friction with colleagues or a re-evaluation about whether the job was the best fit, like Mr. Craig; Mark Lippert, the National Security Council chief of staff; Ellen Moran, the communications director; Desiree Rogers, the social secretary; and Jackie Norris, the first lady's chief of staff.
Ms. Romer clashed early on with Lawrence H. Summers, the National Economic Council chief, and there was tension with others on the economics team. But she told Bloomberg TV that she was moving home because her 13-year-old son was starting high school, not because of differences with Mr. Summers.
''Larry has become one of my dear friends,'' she said. ''I know there have been lots of reports of some fireworks early on. But the truth is, we are great colleagues. I think we've been a good team and fought for many of exactly the same policies.''
Those who leave can find jobs with higher salary and fewer hours. Ms. Rogers was named Tuesday as chief executive of the Johnson Publishing Company, which produces Jet and Ebony magazines. Ms. Johnston will become vice president for corporate affairs at Siemens. ''There's no place more rewarding to work than the White House,'' she said, ''so for me this was not a job decision but a life decision and a great opportunity.''
Anita Dunn understood the life decision enough to decline a permanent position in the first place. When asked to serve as communications director, she insisted on staying only seven months. ''The White House is a difficult, challenging place for someone trying to raise children,'' Ms. Dunn said.
White House officials show up for work at 7 a.m., go home at, say, 8 p.m. and find themselves on e-mail until they fall asleep, often six or seven days a week. Mr. Orszag told friends that he felt liberated now having only one BlackBerry.
''I was never off my BlackBerry -- ever,'' said Ms. Douglass, who was spokeswoman for the health care drive. At dinner, even with her husband, she would sneak to the bathroom or keep it in her lap. ''It was just the three of us -- him, me and my BlackBerry. I felt like I was losing friendships.''
Ms. Douglass said working at the White House was a great honor, but one that ultimately required tradeoffs. ''I think everybody there,'' she said, ''is dedicated and loyal -- and torn.''

HEADLINE: For Fed, The Choices Get Harder

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Six months into his second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke is finding it tough to get ahead of the curve.
Under his direction, the central bank shifted course on Tuesday, setting aside its talk of eventually tightening credit and taking a mostly symbolic step to help the flagging recovery. But on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 2.5 percent as investors seemed to pay more attention to the Fed's gloomier outlook than to its willingness to take new action.
Having failed in 2007 to anticipate the subprime mortgage crisis and the economic havoc that resulted, Mr. Bernanke is eager not to seem slow or complacent as the recovery shows signs of stalling. But compared with three years ago, the Fed's options now are more limited, and the consequences of acting (or not) potentially more dangerous.
''The challenges the Fed faces aren't going to get any easier in the coming months,'' said Carl E. Walsh, a professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. ''The choices ahead are only getting worse as the economy seems to be slowing down.'' 
In agreeing to use proceeds from the Fed's vast mortgage-bond portfolio to buy long-term Treasury securities, the Federal Open Market Committee surprised some economists, who had expected the central bank's policy makers to wait until their next meeting, in September.
But in some ways, the decision on Tuesday was a fairly easy one for the Fed. It assuaged officials, like the presidents of the Fed district banks in Boston and New York, who are worried about the incipient threat of deflation. But it also was acceptable to inflation hawks, because it means that the Fed will own fewer mortgage bonds and more government debt, the traditional mainstay of its portfolio.
What happens next could be far less palatable. Using its power to create money, the central bank bought $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities, $175 billion in debts owed by government-controlled enterprises like Fannie Mae, and $300 billion in Treasury securities from January 2009 to March 2010.
By buying debt, the Fed pushed bond prices upward and pushed long-term interest rates downward, as bond yields move inversely to price.
That strategy of buying financial assets to increase the money supply and stimulate economic growth is what economists call quantitative easing because it tends to loosen credit.
It was a new tactic for the Fed, and in the coming months, Mr. Bernanke, who had hoped to be done with the asset purchases, will have to decide whether a new round is warranted. Even he has expressed uncertainty about whether the strategy will carry diminishing returns.
Professor Walsh noted that economists ''don't have a lot of good historical episodes in modern economies to know exactly what the effects of quantitative easing are.''
''What we have is an example of the detrimental effects of failing to engage in quantitative easing: the Great Depression,'' he said.
Mr. Bernanke, a student of the Depression, has long argued that the central bank has additional tools, even after lowering short-term interest rates to zero, to avoid deflation.
But to some, the Fed has been using those tools inappropriately.
''What is holding back the economy today has nothing to do with standard macroeconomic policy,'' said William Poole, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. ''It's a consequence of the enormous -- unprecedented since the 1930s -- uncertainty about the regulatory regime.''
Mr. Poole called the Fed's action this week ''essentially meaningless, quite frankly,'' adding that he did not believe it would help stimulate the economy.
''I would never have accumulated the big portfolio of mortgage-backed securities in the first place,'' said Mr. Poole, who retired in 2008, before the crisis hit. ''To me, the appropriate function of the central bank is to provide generalized liquidity, and not support for particular sectors, which is properly a fiscal policy decision.''
Mr. Poole's view is openly shared, so far, by only one member of the committee: Thomas M. Hoenig, the president of the Kansas City Fed, who was the lone dissenter when the committee voted this week.
But others might also look askance at another round of quantitative easing. At a speech in June, Kevin M. Warsh, a member of the Fed's board of governors, said the Fed's institutional credibility could be at risk if it expanded its balance sheet beyond its current $2.3 trillion.
Mr. Warsh also said that further asset purchases might foster ''perceptions of monetizing indebtedness,'' printing money to pay off the public debt.
Mr. Walsh, of the University of California, acknowledged that concern but said it did not pose a threat -- yet.
''On a very simple level, the Fed is printing money so the Treasury can spend more than it's collecting in tax revenues,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''Relative to the total size of the federal deficit, this is a small part, and these are highly unusual circumstances, so no one is too worried about it. But it is always a temptation to use the central bank to finance government expenditures.''
Mr. Walsh raised other concerns about further quantitative easing. He said the strategy might not appreciably influence long-term interest rates, which are already low. Or any impact might be transitory.
If banks were to withdraw the $1 trillion they hold at the Fed too quickly, it could generate inflation. Moreover, Mr. Walsh said, ''changes in expectations about future inflation can influence current inflation, even if the economy is below its potential.''
In the worst case, he said, the economy could return to the stagflation of the late 1970s, when prices rose as growth lagged.
Of course, where some observers fear excessive boldness in Mr. Bernanke, others see an unacceptable timidity. ''I think the Fed has been intellectually behind the curve,'' said Albert M. Wojnilower, an economist who worked for the New York Fed from 1951 to 1962. ''Except when the crisis was at its worst, the Fed has been worried about future inflation, when all along, that has been the wrong worry.''
He added: ''They have been expecting the world to assume the shape that their models predict, a world in which 'animal spirits' are overflowing. In the U.S., we have the opposite problem.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 23, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis article on Aug. 12 about policy choices confronting the Federal Reserve misstated the year that William Poole, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, retired. It was 2008, not 2007. A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Eat an Apple (Doctor's Orders)

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
The farm stand is becoming the new apothecary, dispensing apples -- not to mention artichokes, asparagus and arugula -- to fill a novel kind of prescription.
Doctors at three health centers in Massachusetts have begun advising patients to eat ''prescription produce'' from local farmers' markets, in an effort to fight obesity in children of low-income families. Now they will give coupons amounting to $1 a day for each member of a patient's family to promote healthy meals.
''A lot of these kids have a very limited range of fruits and vegetables that are acceptable and familiar to them. Potentially, they will try more,'' said Dr. Suki Tepperberg, a family physician at Codman Square Health Center in Dorchester, one of the program sites. ''The goal is to get them to increase their consumption of fruit and vegetables by one serving a day.''
The effort may also help farmers' markets compete with fast-food restaurants selling dollar value meals. Farmers' markets do more than $1 billion in annual sales in the United States, according to the Agriculture Department. 
Massachusetts was one of the first states to promote these markets as hubs of preventive health. In the 1980s, for example, the state began issuing coupons for farmers' markets to low-income women who were pregnant or breast-feeding or for young children at risk for malnourishment. Thirty-six states now have such farmers' market nutrition programs aimed at women and young children.
Thomas M. Menino, the mayor of Boston, said he believed the new children's program, in which doctors write vegetable ''prescriptions'' to be filled at farmers' markets, was the first of its kind. Doctors will track participants to determine how the program affects their eating patterns and to monitor health indicators like weight and body mass index, he said.
''When I go to work in the morning, I see kids standing at the bus stop eating chips and drinking a soda,'' Mr. Menino said in a phone interview earlier this week. ''I hope this will help them change their eating habits and lead to a healthier lifestyle.''
The mayor's attention to healthy eating dates to his days as a city councilman. Most recently he has appointed a well-known chef as a food policy director to promote local foods in public schools and to foster market gardens in the city.
Although obesity is a complex problem unlikely to be solved just by eating more vegetables, supporters of the veggie voucher program hope that physician intervention will spur young people to adopt the kind of behavioral changes that can help forestall lifelong obesity.
Childhood obesity in the United States costs $14.1 billion annually in direct health expenses like prescription drugs and visits to doctors and emergency rooms, according to a recent article on the economics of childhood obesity published in the journal Health Affairs. Treating obesity-related illness in adults costs an estimated $147 billion annually, the article said.
Although the vegetable prescription pilot project is small, its supporters see it as a model for encouraging obese children and their families to increase the volume and variety of fresh produce they eat.
''Can we help people in low-income areas, who shop in the center of supermarkets for low-cost empty-calorie food, to shop at farmers' markets by making fruit and vegetables more affordable?'' said Gus Schumacher, the chairman of Wholesome Wave, a nonprofit group in Bridgeport, Conn., that supports family farmers and community access to locally grown produce.
If the pilot project is successful, Mr. Schumacher said, ''farmers' markets would become like a fruit and vegetable pharmacy for at-risk families.''
The pilot project plans to enroll up to 50 families of four at three health centers in Massachusetts that already have specialized children's programs called healthy weight clinics.
A foundation called CAVU, for Ceiling and Visibility Unlimited, sponsors the clinics that are administering the veggie project. The Massachusetts Department of Agriculture and Wholesome Wave each contributed $10,000 in seed money. (Another arm of the program, at several health centers in Maine, is giving fresh produce vouchers to pregnant mothers.) The program is to run until the end of the farmers' market season in late fall.
One month after Leslie-Ann Ogiste, a certified nursing assistant in Boston, and her 9-year-old son, Makael Constance, received their first vegetable prescription vouchers at the Codman Center, they have lost a combined four pounds, she said. A staff member at the center told Ms. Ogiste about a farmers' market that is five minutes from her apartment, she said.
''It worked wonders,'' said Ms. Ogiste, who bought and prepared eggplant, cucumbers, tomatoes, summer squash, corn, bok choy, parsley, carrots and red onions. ''Just the variety, it did help.''
Ms. Ogiste said she had minced some vegetables and used them in soup, pasta sauce and rice dishes -- the better to disguise the new good-for-you foods that she served her son.
Makael said he did not mind. ''It's really good,'' he said.
Some nutrition researchers said that the Massachusetts project had a good chance of improving eating habits in the short term. But, they added, a vegetable prescription program in isolation may not have a long-term influence on reducing obesity. Families may revert to their former habits in the winter when the farmers' markets are closed, these researchers said, or they may not be able to afford fresh produce after the voucher program ends.
Dr. Shikha Anand, the medical director of CAVU's healthy weight initiative, said the group hoped to make the veggie prescription project a year-round program through partnerships with grocery stores.
But people tend to overeat junk food in higher proportion than they undereat vegetables, said Dr. Deborah A. Cohen, a senior natural scientist at the RAND Corporation. So, unless people curtail excessive consumption of salty and sugary snacks, she said, behavioral changes like eating more fruit and vegetables will have limited effect on obesity.
In a recent study led by Dr. Cohen, for example, people in southern Louisiana typically exceeded guidelines for eating salty and sugary foods by 120 percent in the course of a day while falling short of vegetable and fruit consumption by 20 percent.
The weight clinics in Massachusetts chosen for the vegetable prescription test project already encourage families to cut down on unhealthy snacks.
Even as Ms. Ogiste and her son started shopping at the farmers' market and eating more fresh produce, for example, they also cut back on junk food, she said.
''We have stopped the snacks. We are drinking more water and less soda and less juice too,'' Ms. Ogiste said. ''All of that helped.''

HEADLINE: Indian Forces Face Broader Revolt in Kashmir

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN; Hari Kumar contributed reporting.

 BODY:
SRINAGAR, Kashmir -- Late Sunday night, after six days on life support with a bullet in his brain, Fida Nabi, a 19-year-old high school student, was unhooked from his ventilator at a hospital here.
Mr. Nabi was the 50th person to die in Kashmir's bloody summer of rage. He had been shot in the head, his family and witnesses said, during a protest against India's military presence in this disputed province.
For decades, India maintained hundreds of thousands of security forces in Kashmir to fight an insurgency sponsored by Pakistan, which claims this border region, too. The insurgency has been largely vanquished. But those Indian forces are still here, and today they face a threat potentially more dangerous to the world's largest democracy: an intifada-like popular revolt against the Indian military presence that includes not just stone-throwing young men but their sisters, mothers, uncles and grandparents.
The protests, which have erupted for a third straight summer, have led India to one of its most serious internal crises in recent memory. Not just because of their ferocity and persistence, but because they signal the failure of decades of efforts to win the assent of Kashmiris using just about any tool available: money, elections and overwhelming force. 
''We need a complete revisit of what our policies in Kashmir have been,'' said Amitabh Mattoo, a professor of strategic affairs at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi and a Kashmiri Hindu. ''It is not about money -- you have spent huge amounts of money. It is not about fair elections. It is about reaching out to a generation of Kashmiris who think India is a huge monster represented by bunkers and security forces.''
Indeed, Kashmir's demand for self-determination is sharper today than it has been at perhaps any other time in the region's troubled history. It comes as -- and in part because -- diplomatic efforts remain frozen to resolve the dispute created more than 60 years ago with the partition of mostly Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan. Today each nation controls part of Kashmir, whose population is mostly Muslim.
Secret negotiations in 2007, which came close to creating an autonomous region shared by the two countries, foundered as Pervez Musharraf, then Pakistan's president, lost his grip on power. The terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India's financial capital, by Pakistani militants in 2008 derailed any hope for further talks.
Not least, India has consistently rebuffed any attempt at outside mediation or diplomatic entreaties, including efforts by the United States. The intransigence has left Kashmiris empty-handed and American officials with little to offer Pakistan on its central preoccupation -- India and Kashmir -- as they struggle to encourage Pakistan's help in cracking down on the Taliban and other militants in the country.
With no apparent avenue to progress, many Kashmiris are despairing that their struggle is taking place in a vacuum, and they are taking matters into their own hands.
''What we are seeing today is the complete rebound effect of 20 years of oppression,'' said Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, the chief cleric at Srinagar's main mosque and a moderate separatist leader. Kashmiris, he said, are ''angry, humiliated and willing to face death.''
This summer there have been nearly 900 clashes between protesters and security forces, which have left more than 50 civilians dead, most of them from gunshot wounds. While more than 1,200 soldiers have been wounded by rock-throwing crowds, not one has been killed in the unrest, leading to questions about why Indian security forces are using deadly force against unarmed civilians -- and why there is so little international outcry.
''The world is silent when Kashmiris die in the streets,'' said Altaf Ahmed, a 31-year-old schoolteacher.
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made an emotional appeal for peace.
''I can feel the pain and understand the frustration that is bringing young people out into the streets of Kashmir,'' the Indian prime minister said in a televised speech. ''Many of them have seen nothing but violence and conflict in their lives and have been scarred by suffering.''
Indeed, there is a palpable sense of opportunities squandered. Despite the protests of recent years, the Kashmir Valley had in the past few years been enjoying a season of peace.
The insurgency of the 1990s has mostly dried up, and elections in 2008 drew the highest percentage of voters in a generation. High expectations met the new chief minister, Omar Abdullah, a scion of Kashmir's leading political family, whose fresh face seemed well suited to bringing better government and prosperity to Kashmir.
But election promises, like repealing laws that largely shield security forces from scrutiny and demilitarizing the state, went unfulfilled. After two summers of protests on specific grievances, this summer's unrest has taken on a new character, one more difficult to define and mollify.
That anger has led to a cycle of violence that the Indian government seems powerless to stop. Events that unfolded last week in Pulwama, a small town 20 miles from Srinagar, illustrate how the violence feeds itself.
It began on Monday, Aug. 2, when a young man, Mohammad Yacoub Bhatt, from a village near Pulwama was shot dead during a march to protest the earlier killings of other young protesters.
Four days later, a procession set off to protest his death. Soon it swelled into the thousands. The police blocked the road and refused to let the marchers pass, worried that the crowd would burn down government buildings, as previous crowds had.
What happened next is disputed. Protesters claimed that when they tried to surge through a barricade, the police opened fire.
''We did not think they would open fire,'' said Malik Shahid, 17, who had joined the march. ''There was no violence. It was a peaceful protest.''
First the police fired in the air, witnesses said, then into the scattering crowd. A bullet felled Mr. Shahid's uncle, Shabir Ahmed Malik, a 24-year-old driver, and killed him on the spot.
Mr. Shahid, a 12th grader who hopes to become an engineer, said the latest violence was evidence to him that remaining part of India was impossible.
''If India took steps against those who kill us, maybe the people of Kashmir would be willing,'' he said. ''But when there is no justice how can we remain with India? They are not doing anything but killing. So we will just go for freedom.''
Commandant Prabhakar Tripathy, spokesman for the Central Reserve Police Force, the main paramilitary force trying to keep order in Kashmir, declined to comment on the episode but said that the protests were not as spontaneous as they appeared.
''Militants are just mingling with the crowd, firing bullets from the crowd,'' Mr. Tripathy said. ''Now they are trying to raise this confrontation between the public and the security forces.''
''We are charging them with tear gas, rubber pellets, firing in the air, nothing works here,'' he said. ''When a crowd of thousands attacks the camp, what can you do?''
Indian officials have tried to portray Kashmir's stone-throwing youths as illiterate pawns of jihadist forces across the Pakistan border and have suggested that economic development and jobs are the key to getting young people off the streets.
But many of the stone throwers are hardly illiterate. They organize on Facebook, creating groups with names like ''Im a Kashmiri Stone Pelter.'' One young man who regularly joins protests and goes by the nom de guerre Khalid Khan has an M.B.A. and a well-paying job.
''Stone pelting is a form of resistance to their acts of repression in the face of peaceful protest,'' he said in an interview. ''I would call it self-defense. Stones do not kill. Their bullets kill.''
Each death seems to feed the anger on the streets, creating new recruits for the revolt. Fida Nabi's brother, Aabid, 21, watched over him as he drifted toward death this week, his head swathed in white bandages, his chest rising and falling to the ghostly rhythm of the ventilator.
Aabid thought he had his life all mapped out -- making more than $200 a month as a news photographer. But since his brother was shot his priorities have changed. ''I used to cover the protests,'' he said. ''But now I will join them.''

HEADLINE: The State of the War

 BODY:
We believe that the United States has a powerful national interest in Afghanistan, in depriving Al Qaeda of a safe haven on either side of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. This country would also do enormous damage to its moral and strategic standing if it now simply abandoned the Afghan people to the Taliban's brutalities.
But, like many Americans, we are increasingly confused and anxious about the strategy in Afghanistan and wonder whether, at this late date, there is a chance of even minimal success.
The trove of military documents recently published in The Times showed, once again, why this is so hard: the weakness of the Afghan Army and the corruption of the Afghan government; the double game being played by Pakistan; the failure of the Bush administration, for seven years, to invest enough troops, money or attention in a war that it allowed to drag on until it has now become the longest in the nation's history. 
The WikiLeaks documents, however, end in late 2009 and don't show us how the war is going now or whether President Obama's decision in December to send 30,000 more troops (the last won't be in place until the end of this month) has a chance of altering those realities.
The answer to that question also depends on whether President Obama and his top advisers can finally secure the full commitment and cooperation of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, and Pakistan's military commander, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.
The first test of the new counterinsurgency strategy, in Marja, population 60,000, did not go well. American Marines drove the Taliban from Marja's center in late February, but the ''government in a box'' that was supposed to win over the population with security, services and honest governance didn't arrive. Competent Afghan officials didn't want the risk or the hardship of moving there.
Taliban fighters quickly began a campaign of intimidation and assassination. Many local residents have been too frightened to sign up for American-financed reconstruction projects. With too few Afghan security forces to hold the town, the Marines have not been able to move beyond Marja.
American officials say things are improving. Some schools and markets have reopened, and as of mid-July there were 21 Afghan officials working at the Interim Government Center, with another 7 to 10 positions unfilled. Marja remains isolated and dangerous.
We were told that Marja was a rehearsal for a major offensive this spring around Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's spiritual base. Breaking the insurgents' hold there was supposed to send a powerful message that the tide of the war is finally changing. After Marja, though, the Kandahar offensive was postponed, reinforcing the impression of drift.
Mr. Obama has promised to review his policy this December. We agree that the ''surge'' and his new commander, Gen. David Petraeus, need time. But reports from the ground have been so relentlessly grim -- July's death toll of 66 American troops was the highest since the war began -- that Mr. Obama needs to do a better job right now of explaining the strategy and how he is measuring progress. Here are some of the things Americans and American allies, who are even more anxious about the war, need to hear:
THE PLAN AFTER MARJA Do the president and his generals still believe that counterinsurgency -- securing crucial areas and building up local governments -- is the best chance for driving back the Taliban? Is it even possible? What lessons were learned in Marja? How has it changed their approach in Kandahar?
American officials now insist that it was wrong to think about Kandahar as a set piece offensive. The city is already under the formal control of the Afghan government, and they say Special Forces are already pounding the Taliban outside the city while efforts to improve services and security inside are under way. Claiming that the media somehow didn't get it right doesn't help. The White House and Pentagon need to explain clearly what is happening there.
One of the first bureaucratic fights General Petraeus won after assuming command was his insistence on spending more than $200 million for diesel generators and fuel to increase Kandahar's electricity supply. That sounds like a sensible way to win local support.
We are concerned about the administration's decision not to challenge the control of Ahmed Wali Karzai, the president's younger brother and chief of Kandahar's provincial council. American officials have long claimed that the younger Mr. Karzai is involved in the opium trade and other corrupt enterprises. (He also has been on the C.I.A.'s payroll.) Washington's new line is there are suspicions but ''nothing that will stand up in court.''
How can a more credible government be built in Kandahar with Ahmed Wali Karzai still in place? What is the plan for bringing in and protecting more honest officials? And for tamping down the resentment of other local leaders who complain that the younger Mr. Karzai has grabbed all of the lucrative security and supply contracts? President Karzai could give a major boost to the Kandahar campaign by urging his brother to take a year or two abroad. Failing that, what is Washington doing to ensure that the two Karzais help rather than hinder the effort?
A CREDIBLE PARTNER At a recent international conference in Kabul, President Karzai said all the right things about fighting corruption and Afghans assuming more responsibility for their own security. (For a change, there were no anti-American tantrums.) Does the administration finally have a plan to get him to deliver? Indeed, we are still not clear about the benchmarks that are being set for adequate governance. Has Mr. Karzai been given a detailed list? How can Americans judge if they are being met?
Most urgent, has the administration warned Mr. Karzai of the disastrous consequences -- in Afghanistan and in the United States -- if next month's parliamentary elections are as tainted as last year's presidential vote? Some American officials are so worried that they are hoping a way can be found to get the Afghans to postpone the vote at least until next spring.
Confronting Mr. Karzai head-on hasn't worked. The White House has now decided to play nice, at least in public. We hope American officials are a lot franker in private about the limits of the American public's patience. General Petraeus skillfully managed self-defeating politicians in Iraq. He will need to bring that skill to bear with Mr. Karzai while cultivating a wider array of leaders. He cannot do that alone.
The constant infighting among top American officials over how deeply to invest in the war has to end. It has undermined Americans' confidence and made it far too easy for Mr. Karzai to ignore Washington's advice and demands.
MILITARY AND POLICE TRAINING Like everything else about this war, the effort to train the Afghan Army and police was shortchanged for years under the Bush administration. President Obama has done better, but there is still a very long way to go. News of the way an ambitious Afghan military operation turned into a bloody rout by the Taliban is the latest reminder of that.
In November, the United States and NATO opened a new integrated training mission. Its leader, Lt. Gen. William Caldwell IV, has increased the number of trainers (the allies still need to ante up hundreds more), revamped the Afghan Army leadership program and standardized police instruction, including adding new literacy courses. American military officials said this week that this year's goal of 134,000 Afghan National Army troops and 109,000 police officers has already been met.
After days of discussion, General Petraeus persuaded President Karzai to support the creation of new, lightly armed village defense forces.
Still, we are concerned about a recent report from the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which found serious flaws in how the United States military has been measuring the readiness of Afghanistan's Army and police for the last five years. It also described widespread problems with drug use, corruption and high attrition rates. General Caldwell said the report was based on out-of-date information; the No. 2 American commander in Afghanistan said they were developing a more rigorous system. We are eager to learn about that system and hear the evaluation.
REINTEGRATION AND RECONCILIATION American officials say that any exit strategy will almost certainly include some deal with some Taliban. Americans need to hear more about the plans to woo back lower-level fighters with offers of aid, jobs and security.
We also need to hear more about the plans for reaching out to the insurgency's leaders. An Afghan peace conference in June called for creating a council to negotiate a deal with senior Taliban. Washington has laid down what it insists are clear red lines: Taliban leaders must forswear all ties to Al Qaeda and accept the Afghan Constitution, with its protection of women's rights. Mr. Karzai has embraced the same conditions.
There are also reports that the Afghan president has been secretly negotiating with the Taliban and that Pakistan is eager to broker a deal. American officials say any negotiations have to be Afghan-led, while admitting they are not fully certain who is talking to whom.
We don't know if there is a deal to be had with the Taliban. We are sure that Washington cannot sit on the sidelines. The administration also needs to be thinking hard about a diplomatic strategy to engage or at least neutralize all of the region's meddling players.
MANAGING PAKISTAN The most alarming parts of the WikiLeaks reports were the ones that described how Pakistan's military intelligence service was cynically colluding with the Afghan Taliban, which it sees as a proxy force to ensure its influence in Afghanistan and keep India's at bay.
The administration has said and done many of the right things to try to change Pakistan's behavior: committing to long-term economic aid and constantly reminding Pakistani leaders that they are playing with fire and that extremists, on both sides of the border, pose a genuine threat to their own survival. It is not clear whether they are getting through.
Pakistan has pushed back against the Pakistani Taliban and has allowed the Americans to fly drone strikes against Al Qaeda and other fighters along its border. It also continues to shelter and aid some of the most destructive and dangerous armed factions fighting United States and allied troops in Afghanistan. Americans need to understand what more the administration plans to do to end this support and draw Islamabad fully into the fight -- on the right side.
THE DEADLINE President Obama was intentionally vague last December when he said that American troops would begin to transfer out of Afghanistan by July 2011. At the time, we agreed that a deadline, so long as it was not set in stone, made sense. Americans need to know this war will not go on forever. Mr. Karzai needs to know that American protection is not open-ended. American generals and diplomats need to know that their work is being closely reviewed.
Since then, the administration has sent a host -- a cacophony -- of conflicting signals about the deadline, the strategy and its commitment to the war.
Americans need regular, straight talk from President Obama about what is happening in Afghanistan, for good and ill, and the plan going forward. More ambiguity will only add to the anxiety and confusion.

HEADLINE: Paralysis At The Fed

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Ten years ago, one of America's leading economists delivered a stinging critique of the Bank of Japan, Japan's equivalent of the Federal Reserve, titled ''Japanese Monetary Policy: A Case of Self-Induced Paralysis?'' With only a few changes in wording, the critique applies to the Fed today.
At the time, the Bank of Japan faced a situation broadly similar to that facing the Fed now. The economy was deeply depressed and showed few signs of improvement, and one might have expected the bank to take forceful action. But short-term interest rates -- the usual tool of monetary policy -- were near zero and could go no lower. And the Bank of Japan used that fact as an excuse to do no more. 
That was malfeasance, declared the eminent U.S. economist: ''Far from being powerless, the Bank of Japan could achieve a great deal if it were willing to abandon its excessive caution and its defensive response to criticism.'' He rebuked officials hiding ''behind minor institutional or technical difficulties in order to avoid taking action.''
Who was that tough-talking economist? Ben Bernanke, now the chairman of the Federal Reserve. So why is the Bernanke Fed being just as passive now as the Bank of Japan was a decade ago?
Now, America's current economic troubles aren't exactly identical to those of Japan in 1999-2000: Japan was experiencing outright deflation, while we aren't -- yet. But inflation is well below the Fed's target of around 2 percent, and it is continuing to slide. And Americans face a level of unemployment, and sheer human misery, far worse than anything Japan went through.
Yet the Fed is doing almost nothing to confront these troubles.
What could the Fed be doing? Back when, Mr. Bernanke suggested, among other things, that the Bank of Japan could get traction by buying large quantities of ''nonstandard'' assets -- that is, assets other than the short-term government debt central banks normally hold. The Fed actually put that idea into practice during the most acute phase of the financial crisis, acquiring, in particular, large amounts of mortgage-backed securities. However, it stopped those purchases in March.
Since then, the economic news has grown steadily worse. And earlier this week, the Fed changed course -- but barely. It now says that it will reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities in long-term government bonds. That's a trivial change, basically the least the Fed could get away with without facing a firestorm of criticism -- and far short of the major asset-purchase program the Fed should be undertaking.
Back in 2000, Mr. Bernanke also suggested that the Bank of Japan could move expectations by making announcements about its future policies. In particular, he argued that it could make private-sector borrowing more attractive by announcing that it would keep interest rates low until deflation had given way to 3 percent or 4 percent inflation -- an idea originally suggested by yours truly. Since we are, if anything, in worse shape now than Japan was in 2000, an inflation target of at least 3 percent would very much be in America's interest. But as chairman of the Fed, Mr. Bernanke has explicitly rejected any such move.
What's going on here? Has Mr. Bernanke been intellectually assimilated by the Fed Borg? I prefer to believe that he's being political, unwilling to engage in open confrontation with other Fed officials -- especially those regional Fed presidents who fear inflation, even with deflation the clear and present danger, and are evidently unmoved by the plight of the unemployed.
And in fairness to Mr. Bernanke, discord among senior officials also makes it difficult for policy to change expectations: it would be hard to credibly commit to higher inflation if this commitment were constantly being undercut by speeches out of the Richmond or Dallas Feds. In fact, I'd argue that loose talk by some Fed officials is already having a negative economic impact. But while Mr. Bernanke doesn't have the authority to stop that loose talk, he could make it clear that it doesn't represent overall Fed policy.
Last, but not least, policy is suffering from an act of neglect by President Obama, who waited until his 16th month in office before offering a full slate of nominees to fill vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board. If he had filled those slots quickly -- his nominees still aren't in place -- the Fed might be less passive.
But whatever the reasons, the fact is that the Fed -- which is required by statute to promote ''maximum employment'' -- isn't doing its job. Instead, like the rest of Washington, it's inventing reasons to dither in the face of mass unemployment. And while the Fed sits there in its self-inflicted paralysis, millions of Americans are losing their jobs, their homes and their hopes for the future.

HEADLINE: Why Imitation Is the Sincerest Form of Fashion

BYLINE: By KAL RAUSTIALA and CHRISTOPHER SPRIGMAN. 
Kal Raustiala and Christopher Sprigman are professors of law at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Virginia, respectively.

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY is one of the world's great centers of fashion. So it's not surprising that New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, would take an interest in fashion designers. Last week he introduced legislation that would rewrite copyright law to cover their designs. But his bill could hurt the fashion industry more than it would help, and raise consumer prices along the way.
It strikes many people as strange that fashion designs are not already protected against copying. Creative artists like musicians and filmmakers argue, quite persuasively, that their success requires copyright protection for their work. If others could steal it, they say, innovation would grind to a halt. 
But there is a good reason that fashion designs have never been protected by copyright. Some designers have lost sales to knockoffs, but the copying of designs has not been a serious threat to the survival of the industry. To the contrary, much of the growth and creativity in the industry depends on imitation.
Why is that? Because of something we all know instinctively about fashion. As Shakespeare put it, ''The fashion wears out more apparel than the man.'' That is, many people buy new clothes not because they need them, but only to keep up with the latest style.
Without copyright restrictions, designers are free to rework a design and jump on board what they hope will be a money-making style. The result is the industry's most sacred concept: the trend. Copying creates trends, and trends are what sell fashion. Every season we see designers ''take inspiration'' from others. Trends catch on, become overexposed and die. Then new designs take their place.
This cycle is familiar. But what is rarely recognized is that the cycle is accelerated by the freedom to copy.
Mr. Schumer's proposal isn't the first effort to copyright fashion. Unlike previous attempts, however, this bill, the Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Prevention Act, takes a very narrow, and therefore less onerous, approach. It would protect only ''unique'' designs -- those that are truly new and distinguishable. And only ''substantially identical'' copies would be illegal.
Some designers, believing that every clothing design is a reworking of something we've seen before, question whether the proposed law would matter. Indeed, if the legislation were applied exactly as it's written, with its stringent standard of uniqueness, it would matter very rarely.
But the greater risk is that once it's in the hands of lawyers and judges, such a law would expand in a way that harms many designers and consumers. Plaintiffs' lawyers would make creative arguments, and judges would tend to interpret the bill's language expansively. This has been the pattern in copyright for decades. Indeed, lawyers (and those designers who could afford them) would be among the biggest beneficiaries, as disputes would likely erupt into expensive, time-consuming lawsuits featuring designers squabbling over ownership of allegedly unique styles.
In any case, a legal mechanism already exists to protect a truly novel design: a patent. But instead of a specialized federal agency determining what is novel, Senator Schumer's bill would require that the novelty be assessed by a judge, whose sole experience with fashion might consist of a semi-annual trip to a department store.
To make matters worse, the bill would allow plaintiffs to pursue the wealthiest manufacturers and sellers of fashion. Retailers, for example, could be held liable for any copies they sold. Unlike earlier proposals, Mr. Schumer's bill contains no requirement that copyrighted designs be registered so that retailers and other designers are put on notice.
While many designers have suffered financial losses in the recession, the American fashion industry as a whole has enjoyed steady growth since World War II. Today, apparel businesses in the United States take in more than $300 billion a year and employ millions of people.
There's no doubt that some designers suffer losses from copying. But Mr. Schumer's bill is a cure that would be worse than the illness. With copyright protection fashion prices would rise, and the creative cycle would slow down.

HEADLINE: American Soccer Is Hitting the Right Notes

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Harrison, N.J.
Thierry Henry will not say American soccer fans sing better than English fans. But they do sing well.
And maybe that is the missing link, the natural order of soccer progression. First the fans learn to sing together in a cappella support of their lads, then a great homegrown striker emerges from the mists.
Henry, once a great star in the Premier League with Arsenal, says he has heard home fans in Houston, Chicago and now the New York metropolitan area keep their teams in the game with musical accompaniment for the entire 90 minutes. 
Without blaring vuvuzelas marring the sound, Henry made his home debut Wednesday evening, playing the first half and assisting on the goal as the Red Bulls defeated Toronto, 1-0.
But this musical talent breaking out all over Major League Soccer does not mean the sport is in for a golden age. In fact, this part of the continent might have had its golden age in the 1970s, when the late, lamented Cosmos were filling the late and perhaps soon-to-be-lamented Giants Stadium and other places.
Something is stirring in the United States in the wake of the recent World Cup in South Africa. Apparently a few stirring rallies as the Yanks were eliminated in the Round of 16 went over better with fans back home than they did with the hard-to-please American players, officials and even reporters who witnessed the sluggish starts and lapses up close.
''I never say we are turning the corner because it seems to me that if you turn the corner four times, you are back where you started,'' Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, said the other night, when 77,223 fans nearly filled New Meadowlands Stadium for a rather unimpressive 2-0 loss to Brazil by the national team.
Something is definitely happening, Gulati added, ''when you can't get into a pub to watch a World Cup match at 10 o'clock in the morning.''
Landon Donovan's stirring goal in the 91st minute against Algeria, to allow the Yanks to advance to the next round, seems to have been a magic moment back home -- so much so that Donovan was on David Letterman shortly after the Yanks were knocked out by Ghana.
All 25,000 seats in the lovely if modest-sized Red Bull Arena are sold out for Donovan's appearance with the Los Angeles Galaxy on Saturday night. Perhaps some of those tickets were sold before what's-his-name blew out his Achilles' tendon last spring, but Donovan, not any of the elderly stars from the top leagues in Europe, is now the glamour boy of M.L.S.
''You guys should be proud of Landon Donovan, he's a great player,'' Henry told reporters Wednesday after his first league home game enticed only 19,035 fans on a weekday night. Henry is working through a tight groin muscle and cannot guarantee he will be up for 90 minutes Saturday, but he made a few silky moves and alert passes, enough to give promise of more.
This franchise has been down this road. The MetroStars, now in witness-protection identity as the Red Bulls, have trotted out one Donadoni after another Djorkaeff, without much impact. They were cool guys, but they were essentially taking a pay cut to live in New York in their athletic old age.
So is Henry, for that matter, taking the PATH train out to the stadium on occasion. He came by car for Wednesday's match, he said, because his mother is visiting from France. C'est un bon fils.
This influx of so-called designated players is a departure for the league, which has tried to avoid lavishing huge sums of money on aged glamour. But maybe in the 15th season, it is time to spend.
''Our goals are different,'' said Erik Stover, the managing director of the Red Bulls, who are owned by the Austria-based highly caffeinated energy-drink maker, which advances its brand with soccer.
''We need to be the flagship club of the M.L.S.,'' Stover said. ''Our owners are not going to accept anything less.''
Stover does not think the World Cup has any ''magic bullet'' on the gate; otherwise there might have been a sellout Wednesday. But the crowd raised the season average for nine matches to 16,583, which would be the best season average for the club since 2004. In this economy, that's not bad.
Still, the crowds -- and the salaries -- are nothing like the giddy blitz of the '70s, when Pele and Beckenbauer walked the land.
''Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see them replicate the Cosmos, but I would say it's nearly impossible,'' said Shep Messing, the goalkeeper for part of the '70s and now a broadcaster with the Red Bulls, who said he was ''cautiously optimistic'' about the progress.
Investors recently bought the name Cosmos, which had been languishing under legal lock and key for a few decades, and are talking about building a New York rival to the Red Bulls. Stover is all for it, but says it will not be easy.
Anybody who saw the Yanks stumble around against Brazil the other night may worry if this country is ever going to have a golden age in the World Cup. But Thierry Henry says American fans sing well. Maybe there will be Welsh-style choral competitions in 2014 to go along with the World Cup in Brazil. Maybe M.L.S. fans can advance further than the Round of 16.

HEADLINE: Markets Fall a 3rd Day on Slowdown Signs

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
A decline in technology shares and weak jobs data sent Wall Street indexes down on Thursday, as traders were confronted with more signs that the global economy was slowing.
The stock market in the United States followed European and Asian exchanges lower, declining more than 100 points early in the day. But the market cut some of those losses in later trading.
By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average, which went into the red for the year on Wednesday, was down 58.88 points, or 0.57 percent, to 10,319.95. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 5.86 points, or 0.54 percent, to 1,083.61 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 18.36 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,190.27. 
The market decline followed additional signs of a slowdown this week -- a disappointing weekly job report and a below-expectations outlook by the technology bellwether Cisco Systems.
They were the latest of several disappointing developments that included an acknowledgment by Federal Reserve officials that the pace of recovery in the United States had slowed.
William J. Schultz, chief investment officer for McQueen, Ball & Associates, said that the jobs report and the pessimistic view from Cisco started the market lower, with few factors to inspire a turnaround later.
''You started off with unemployment claims and the sense that you are really not seeing an improvement on the employment side,'' Mr. Schultz said. ''It is not getting that much worse, but it is not getting better.''
''It does not lead you to want to commit capital here, because it has not paid off,'' he said. ''People are willing to take a much slower approach. We had a nice little bump when earnings started in July, but now things just faded.''
Investors have reacted to macroeconomic data in the last few weeks, and a majority of it has pointed to a sluggish economy. Most notable was data, including trade deficit figures, that indicated gross domestic product for the second quarter was likely to be revised downward.
Filings for jobless benefits rose by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 484,000, the government reported on Thursday, their highest level in almost six months. Analysts had expected a decline.
''Once again, we can say with near total certainty that there is no meaningful improvement on the labor front,'' Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Company, said.
Cisco added to the anxiety by reporting revenue late Wednesday that fell short of forecasts and offering an outlook that was also below expectations.
The Cisco chief executive, John T. Chambers, said it had received many mixed signals on the economy, adding that it was seeing a period of ''unusual uncertainty.''
Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research Institute, said, ''Conditions aren't getting any better and fiscal stimulus is starting to run out.''
''People are starting to think about the third quarter,'' he said.
Technology stocks were down 1.7 percent. Cisco shares were heavily traded, closing down $2.37, at $21.36. Intel was up 3 cents, at $19.45, and Microsoft was down 37 cents, at $24.49.
Financials and industrials also fell. Bank of America was down 13 cents, closing at $13.06, and General Electric was down 20 cents, at $15.49. Caterpillar closed $1.21 lower at $67.50. Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's 10-year note fell 5/32, to 98 30/32, and the yield rose to 2.75 percent from 2.73 percent late Wednesday
The market also gauged the prospects for a slowdown in Europe and China.
New figures from Eurostat showed industrial production in the euro zone dipped unexpectedly by 0.1 percent, in June, after climbing 1.1 percent in May. But gross domestic product figures for the region, due Friday, are expected to be positive.
In London, the FTSE 100 index settled 0.4 percent higher. The DAX in Frankfurt was down 0.31 percent and the CAC 40 in Paris was 0.2 percent lower.

HEADLINE: To Cut Demand for Electricity, Some Customers Agree to Unplug

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Electricity use is up sharply this summer, but in a windowless room near Albany that is the nerve center of New York State's grid, controllers have noticed that something else is not rising: peak load.
Peak load is the single hour of highest use in the course of the year, a condition for which the electric system is designed and which is the focus of utilities' operating strategies and, sometimes, prayers. Driven by each new air-conditioner, computer and flat-screen television, peak load grew inexorably from the 1980s until the recession.
But it has stopped its climb, and experts say more is at work here than the stalled economy. 
Electricity experts compare July 2010 to August 2006, when New York State set its all-time peak demand, 33,939 megawatts. Energy consumption last month was 7.8 percent higher than in August 2006. But the peak demand was 1.4 percent lower.
(Last summer was relatively cool and did not yield high numbers for energy consumption or peak demand.)
There are several small reasons that consumption grows while peak load does not. One is weather patterns, the ratio of very hot days, which drive consumption, to extremely hot days, which drive peak. But another is man-made: ''demand-side management,'' under which customers agree to unplug when controllers need them to.
When balancing electricity supply with demand, demand-side management is a huge weight on the scale on critically hot days.
From the fountain at Lincoln Center to the laundry room and swimming pool at the Gotham condominium building on East 87th Street to the elevators and loading dock lighting at 344 Hudson Street in Manhattan, things are being turned off when supply demands it.
The system controllers in Albany, at the New York Independent System Operator, now count about 37,400 megawatts of generators statewide that can be turned on, and about 2,200 megawatts of consuming devices that can be turned off.
This is not an emergency procedure or an appeal to civic duty -- although those can still be invoked on occasion. Rather, it is a commercial transaction with a protocol planned long in advance. On the afternoon before an anticipated surge in demand, e-mails, faxes and phone calls go out alerting those who had already agreed that it is time for them to unplug.
''You get called a day ahead, and all hell breaks loose when they call,'' said Leo Cutone of Cutone & Company Consultants, which recruits buildings and institutions to participate. Common steps are adjusting air-conditioning thermostats, turning off some elevators, switching off lobby lights or starting up emergency generators.
''If it's nice and sunny enough, then the lobby is bright enough without artificial lighting,'' said Lewis Kwit of Energy Investment Systems, a company that serves as a ''demand response service provider.''
Mr. Kwit has lined up about 10 apartment buildings where superintendents will close the laundry room and post signs asking tenants to delay using their dishwashers until the early morning. ''You can save 20 to 30 percent,'' he said.
Companies that recruit buildings or property owners to participate are paid by the New York Independent System Operator or by the local utility. The prices have been running $12 to $13 per kilowatt of reduction.
Alfonse Amore, the senior vice president at Trinity Real Estate, a property management company, said it enrolled 13 office buildings in the program this summer. Building personnel go from door to door asking tenants to turn off nonessential equipment.
''Tenants are fully aware of the problems with electrical distribution,'' he said. ''They want to continue in business without having a blackout or a brownout.'' And they understand immediately when walking through a slightly darkened lobby, he said.
Trinity's buildings have a collective load of 16 megawatts and can cut that by 2 megawatts, said Alec V. Salticov, the manager of engineering. Next summer, he will try for 3.5 megawatts, he said. The procedure was invoked by the grid operators three times in July, Mr. Salticov said.
Participants have meters with modems or other communications devices that report to a local utility four times an hour. For energy companies, demand-side management may help them avoid building power plants that would be needed only a few hours a year or transmission and distribution lines that would seldom be used to capacity. Trimming the peak load by a few percentage points means getting more use out of existing equipment.
In a place like New York, where getting permission to build a plant or power line is extremely difficult, energy experts say the strategy is especially valuable. And its effects are obvious at Consolidated Edison, said Joseph Oates, vice president of energy management.
Con Ed's peak load growth had been 1.5 percent a year but will probably be only about 0.35 percent for the next few years, despite the proliferation of cheap air-conditioners and big-screen televisions. ''We think it's a permanent change,'' he said.
Apart from the proceeds flowing to the demand response service providers and customers, the technique may also ultimately cut costs for nonparticipants. Electricity is priced in an auction system, and reducing demand reduces the price.

HEADLINE: A Regular-Guy Approach To Entice Men to Shop for Jeans

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
MIKE ROWE, the star of ''Dirty Jobs'' on the Discovery Channel, has tackled some arduous tasks, among them shark repellent tester and septic tank cleaner. But now he confronts perhaps the dirtiest job of all: persuading shoppers to buy a new product when the economy appears to be weakening again.
Mr. Rowe has been signed to a multiyear contract to be the spokesman for Lee Premium Select, a line of men's denim being introduced by the Lee Jeans unit of the VF Corporation. The pants will sell for about $42 a pair -- more expensive than the basic jeans that compose the Wrangler men's line sold by VF, but less costly than men's jeans bearing designer labels. 
Mr. Rowe will appear in all aspects of the campaign, which is scheduled to begin on Monday. There will be television commercials, print advertisements and efforts in social media like Facebook and Twitter.
Mr. Rowe will also be featured on a microsite, or special Web site, devoted to humorous efforts to make men feel better about buying clothes. The site, shopphobia.com, trades on traditional beliefs that men, as a Web page declares, ''prefer running from an angry bear to shopping a storewide sale.''
Several agencies are handling the ads, in keeping with the trend for marketers to use multiple resources for a single campaign. Among them are the New York office of Arnold Worldwide, part of Havas, for the creative work; MEC, part of the GroupM unit of WPP, for media; and Barkley in Kansas City, Mo., for the digital elements and public relations.
Lee plans to spend 30 percent more than it usually does on ads for men's jeans to promote the new line, said Liz Cahill, vice president for marketing at Lee Jeans in Merriam, Kan., and will increase the budget for digital ads by 120 percent.
VF spent $7.8 million last year to advertise Lee Jeans for men in major media, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, compared with $8.4 million in 2008.
VF is also making what Ms. Cahill described as a ''sizable, significant'' donation to the Mike Rowe Works Foundation; she declined to be more specific. The foundation supports workers in the skilled trades with efforts like education and career planning.
''I'm looking for partners who share the same world view about work,'' Mr. Rowe said in a phone interview, particularly in ''reinvigorating the trades.''
''It's something the country ought to be talking about,'' he added. ''We've got to fall back in love with making things.'' Lee Jeans joins a list of brands endorsed by Mr. Rowe that includes Caterpillar, Ford Motor, W. W. Grainger and Motorola.
Mr. Rowe and Ms. Cahill said they have talked about collaborating on a line of work clothes that would, ideally, be made in the United States.
Lee Jeans is among several apparel brands that are seeking to counter the skittishness among shoppers, male and female, as economic data begin to suggest the recovery from the recession may be sputtering. Others include the Dickies line of work wear, the 1969 jeans brand sold by the Gap division of Gap Inc. and Levi's jeans from Levi Strauss & Company.
''It is a little tough the past couple years,'' said John Staffen, chief creative officer at the Arnold New York office, citing not only economic conditions but also the competition in the jeans category, ''from $200 designer jeans all the way back to'' lower-price products.
''We've been playing around with the idea of using someone like Mike Rowe to ground what Lee stands for,'' Mr. Staffen said, ''not designer jeans, not cutting edge, a little more practical.''
''That straightforward honesty seems to sync up with the way people are spending money now,'' he added.
In one commercial, Mr. Rowe looks in a store window and says: ''A hundred bucks for a pair of jeans? Give me a break.''
Lee Premium Select, however, costs ''less than 50 bucks,'' he says, and makes ''my butt look good.''
In another commercial, Mr. Rowe, walking down a street, says: ''You know what I like about my Lee Premium Select jeans? Everything. They're soft, they're strong, they've got a great new fit and my girlfriend says they make my butt look good.''
A young woman he passes chimes in, ''Looking good, Mike.'' As he walks on, he thanks her, then confides sheepishly, ''That's not my girlfriend.''
The commercials end with an announcer declaring, ''Getting comfortable never looked so good.'' That line also doubles as the headline in the print ads.
On shopphobia.com, Mr. Rowe will be lauded, tongue in cheek, as the ''international shop phobic recovery ambassador'' who presents the new jeans as ''the cure for a regular guy's shop phobia.''
Mr. Rowe has an ''approachable persona,'' said Mark Logan, vice president and managing director for interactive at Barkley, enabling the campaign to avoid the cliches typically inherent in ads that portray shopping as a fate for men worse than death or less than manly.
Lee Premium Select jeans will be sold at stores like Kohl's, J. C. Penney and Sears and also on lee.com. Underlining the challenge Lee Jeans faces, the Kohl's Corporation said on Thursday that it expected slower sales growth as the year continues. And Penney has been losing market share to the Macy's unit of Macy's Inc.

HEADLINE: Vacation Apartment Rentals: Lucrative and Largely Illegal

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco. sjames@bayacitizen.org

 BODY:
Summer in San Francisco brings in gusts of chilly winds and bursts of tourists. Instead of staying in hotels, a growing number of visitors opt to live like the locals, renting apartments in the city's colorful neighborhoods.
And in hundreds, possibly thousands, of cases, it appears to be illegal for homes to be rented this way.
Obscure city ordinances dating back 30 years are supposed to prevent apartments from being used as short-term vacation rentals without pre-approval from the city. But since 2004, only one unit has received that permission, according to the Department of Building Inspection, which regulates the practice. 
It is a revelation that raises questions about the legality and consequences of what has become a popular and lucrative piece of the local hospitality business.
Critics say removing apartments from the housing market and turning them into vacation rentals has made it harder for people to find affordable homes. But instead of enforcing the law and stopping the practice, the city has made money by taxing vacation rentals without checking first to see if they are legal.
Ted Gullicksen, executive director of the San Francisco Tenants Union, said, ''The shorthand we have for it is hotelization.''
Mr. Gullicksen said that two-thirds of the city's 800,000 residents were renters -- there are 180,000 rent-controlled units in the city, the primary form of housing -- and that trying to preserve them is ''a constant struggle.'' He estimated that during some recent years as many as 1,000 rental units were lost, converted into private homes, like condominiums, or corporate leases and vacation rentals.
In 1981 -- when there was concern about single-room occupancy housing for the poor being leased to visitors -- the city adopted an ordinance to prohibit renting an apartment for fewer than 30 days unless it had been converted for tourist use, a lengthy process that costs about $41,000 per unit.
But while only one conversion has been officially approved in recent years, the vacation-rental business has boomed.
One popular Web site, Vacation Rentals By Owner, showed 521 listings in San Francisco recently, with some advertisements featuring multiple properties. Craigslist, Come2SF and other services also facilitate vacation rentals. There is no official tally of how many apartments are used for tourists, but over the course of years the number could be in the thousands.
A recent surge in popularity of vacation rentals has been fueled, in part, by the recession, said Christine Karpinski of Vacation Rentals By Owner. ''We've seen a significant increase in properties being added every day,'' Ms. Karpinski said, noting that the price per night tends to be less than half what a hotel room costs.
Ms. Karpinski, whose company requires users to sign an agreement pledging to obey local ordinances, said vacation rentals tended to provide higher revenues for property owners, an average of $33,000 per year, per unit, than residential rentals. Studios in San Francisco typically lease for $14,400 a year. The increase in revenues appeals to landlords, but the money has also enriched city coffers because vacation rentals, unlike permanent tenancies, are subject to a 14 percent hotel tax.
David Augustine, spokesman for the City Treasurer's Office, said the department had been collecting the tax on vacation rentals. There was no accounting available to show how much revenue came from the rentals, Mr. Augustine said, but the hotel tax is one of the most lucrative for the city: $150 million estimated for this fiscal year.
The Treasurer's Office deploys investigators to find vacation rentals and make the owner pay the tax. But the office does not share its list of vacation rentals with the Department of Building Inspection to see if the properties have permission to operate as rentals.
Mr. Augustine said there might be some confidentiality issues if tax information was shared with inspectors. Asked if future cooperation was possible, he said the office would be ''happy to have that conversation.''
But any new enforcement effort could be undermined by the way the ordinance on rentals was written. It is unclear if it applies to buildings of all sizes or whether owners can reside part-time and rent to tourists occasionally.
David Chiu, an outspoken critic of vacation rentals and president of the city's Board of Supervisors, said he would ''see if there are ways to strengthen the law.'' He added, ''We have an extreme scarcity of housing for our residents.''
An increase in available housing could not come fast enough for residents like Aarthi Ananthanarayanan. Visiting an available, minuscule $1,195 per month studio in the Mission district -- with its view of a wall and a toilet that flushed itself every two minutes -- Ms. Ananthanarayanan said she was on her second hunt in a year to find a decent home.
She wants her own space after paying $875 a month to share an apartment with no heat in Noe Valley, where she had had to prevail over dozens of other applicants to get the room.
''I don't think this place is quite right,'' she said, smiling good-naturedly, as the toilet flushed itself again.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Highest Since February

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of workers filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week to the highest level in close to six months, the latest evidence the economy's recovery was faltering. 
The increase in jobless claims added to worries in the stock market, which has failed to make any gains this year.
The number of new claims for state unemployment insurance rose by 2,000, to 484,000 in the week ended Aug. 7, the second consecutive increase, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists had expected claims to edge down to 469,000.
''This is not a good number,'' said John Brady, an analyst at MF Global in Chicago. ''Claims are going the wrong way. That has the market concerned.''
While prices for United States government debt eased as investors locked in recent gains, the dollar rose broadly Thursday as traders worried about the global outlook sought a safe haven.
The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that the economy's recovery was likely to be more modest than expected and that it would take additional steps to support growth.
Casting a further cloud over the global outlook, the euro zone's statistical agency said Thursday that industrial production in the 16-nation currency bloc declined in June, an indication that growth could have softened as a generally vigorous second quarter ended.
Economic data for the United States has been decidedly weak over the last couple of months, with private sector job growth lagging expectations and the unemployment rate stuck at 9.5 percent. That has fed concerns that the economy could be at risk of a renewed recession or could face a debilitating bout of deflation as the bleak job market pressures incomes and prices.
''Whatever recovery we have seen is an outgrowth of inventory restocking and government largess and neither one is sustainable,'' said Bob Andres, chief investment strategist at Merion Wealth Partners in Berwyn, Pa.
The Labor Department said in a separate release that a rise in oil prices pushed the cost of imported goods higher in July for the first time in three months, though at half the pace economists had expected.
Import prices rose 0.2 percent last month after falling 1.3 percent in June and a revised 0.8 percent in May. That left the three-month cumulative total down 2.0 percent, the largest decline since the three months ended February 2009.
Oil import prices rose 2 percent last month after falling for two months. In recent days, oil prices have been declining.
Prices excluding oil fell 0.2 percent in July, signaling a lack of underlying inflation pressure from imports.
In its report on jobless claims, the department said a four-week moving average of new filings, which economists prefer because it smoothes out weekly fluctuations, rose 14,250, to 473,500. Like the initial claims figure, that was the highest level since the week ended Feb. 20.

HEADLINE: When the Devil on Your Shoulder Wins

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
For 20 years as a flight attendant with one airline or another, Steven Slater lived with it.
For all of his public life, as Manhattan borough president and later as mayor, David N. Dinkins listened to it.
And for the most part, whether on the pitcher's mound or in the clubhouse, the high-priced reliever Francisco Rodriguez went along with it.
But something appears to silence the inner voice in all of them. The little voice that says something like ''Stop - don't do it,'' squelching the immediate, intemperate response to one too many argumentative passengers, one too many sign-carrying demonstrators, perhaps one too many clubhouse visitors. 
Apologies? No. Explanations? Weak.
''One of them called out to me by name,'' Mr. Dinkins said, referring to a demonstrator outside the Plaza Hotel as he was going to Representative Charles B. Rangel's birthday fund-raiser on Wednesday evening, ''and that's when I gave him the finger.''
And Mr. Rodriguez, the Mets' closer? ''It's non-baseball related,'' the team's manager, Jerry Manuel, told reporters Wednesday night, after Mr. Rodriguez was accused of punching the father of the woman with whom he has twins.
By then the police were already holding Mr. Rodriguez. Later the Mets put Mr. Rodriguez, who has been known to get angry when he was not used in save situations, on the restricted list for two days without pay.
That may or may not be similar to Mr. Slater's current status at JetBlue. The airline said he had been ''removed from duty'' but would not say whether he was still being paid.
''We're calling Steven Slater a folk hero in a sense because he's acting out a fantasy that all of us have, that we should return rudeness with rudeness,'' said Scott T. Allison, a professor of psychology at the University of Richmond in Virginia. ''We kind of reach a boiling point, but society doesn't allow us to return rudeness with rudeness. And we love to elevate people to the status of hero who defy the norm.''
Somehow, though, the three incidents this week were different from, say, blooper moments - nasty remarks picked up by microphones that were supposed to be turned off. Mr. Slater's and Mr. Dinkins's actions, each acknowledge, were deliberate. The courts may decide about Mr. Rodriguez's.
''There's a shift at the moment in our culture,'' said Richard Pfeiffer, the president of the National Anger Management Association, ''and that is, it's becoming more accepting that functioning out of the primitive part of the brain, doing punishing behaviors, is sometimes justifiable.''
For most people, bad behavior stops at road rage - if they even get that far. ''There are things you just don't do, and most of us don't do them,'' said Craig Fabrikant, a psychologist at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey. ''We're able to have that internal dialogue: 'That's illegal, it's going to get me in trouble, I don't want the consequences, do the crime, do the time.' But a lot of people, they get so angry, so engrossed in what's going on at the moment, that they kind of lose control.''
Dr. Fabrikant offered up an example of someone who decides to shoplift despite knowing better. ''There's a voice in there that tells you this is against the law, there's something wrong with this, but you choose to override it, you suppress it.''
Dr. Fabrikant did not refer to anyone in particular, but his example may apply to Caroline Giuliani, the daughter of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. She was arrested last week on charges of shoplifting five items from a Sephora store on the Upper East Side.
The episode on the JetBlue flight, with Mr. Slater cursing over the intercom, popping open an emergency exit and sliding away on an inflatable chute, resonated because he seemed to be responding to the pressures of the workplace, pressures that Dr. Allison and many others said had been made worse by the recession, by having to do the work of several people, the others having been fired when the company downsized. Or having to fend off e-mail from a boss in the Hamptons while the employee is slaving away in a cubicle.
Dr. Pfeiffer, of the anger management association, mentioned seven factors that can make someone ''function out of the primitive part of the brain,'' among them stress, anxiety and tiredness. And, he said, those factors apply to everyone in a situation.
In Mr. Dinkins's case, perhaps the former mayor - resplendent in a pink seersucker jacket -- was unnerved by that particular heckler, who later identified himself as an occasional guest on Howard Stern's radio show.
''Nobody's all wrong,'' Dr. Pfeiffer said, ''but the flip side is, there's nobody who's all right.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Anguish Over the Plight of the Jobless

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Horror Show'' (column, Aug. 10):
I am an unwilling participant in the horror show that Bob Herbert speaks about. I was laid off in September 2008 and will reach 99 weeks without work very soon and can attest to the sense of hopelessness and underlying feelings of rejection that come along with the long-term effects of unemployment.
It is incredibly frustrating to hear those in Washington continue to talk as if joblessness is their No. 1 priority while ''appropriating more and more money for warfare while schizophrenically babbling about balancing the budget.'' 
I agree that this is not a temporary or short-term problem because, ultimately, the playing field has changed dramatically. Companies that have laid off countless employees are realizing that they no longer need to hire (or they can hire at much lower wages) as they make record profits resulting from decreased payrolls while adding to the workload of those who remain.
What a brilliant concept: The lions are being fed without having to hunt. And there is no incentive for them to change.
Michele Yulo Tucker, Ga., Aug. 10, 2010
To the Editor:
I appreciated Bob Herbert's call to help those unemployed because of our current economic crisis. As a career counselor, I have met with many unemployed people who are financially and emotionally desperate.
I wonder how many members of Congress who have voted against extending benefits to ''the 99ers'' have actually met with these folks and heard their distress. Those with less impressive work histories, skills and networks are especially vulnerable.
Our government needs to do more to address the needs of the long-term unemployed. The Department of Labor statistics show the facts of unemployment and job loss; this is not a partisan issue. If we can spend billions to bail out Wall Street and finance two wars, why can't we scrape up some money or create programs for those eager to work?
Michele Rapp Arlington, Mass., Aug. 10, 2010
To the Editor:
While Bob Herbert is correct in pointing out the dire employment situation in the United States, expecting any meaningful response from the government is futile. It has long been clear that the structure of the United States government, fully controlled by lobbying industries, is not conducive to producing anything of value to the average citizen.
Cases in point are the recent health care bill, which could have been an incubator for innovative, job-creating strategies to redefine our health care delivery but which barely touched on that area, and the recently abandoned energy bill, which could have created not only new jobs but whole new industries in the renewable energy sphere, but fell victim to the paralysis of this useless federal government.
Nor does the government do anything to encourage banks to renew their past role as driving engines for growth. While refusing to lend to individuals and small businesses, our financial institutions spend their energies on money-shuffling Ponzi schemes that half the bankers themselves don't understand, and that produce nothing of value in terms of industry, infrastructure, innovation or new jobs.
The government, including President Obama, not only tolerates this self-absorption but also encourages it with billions of dollars in bailout money when the schemes go sour. Is it any wonder there is anger at the party ostensibly in charge in Washington?
Shel Khipple Wilmette, Ill., Aug. 10, 2010
To the Editor:
Like the fictional TV anchor in the film ''Network,'' people are ''mad as hell'' and no longer will tolerate it. Put simply, the country is losing patience and it's increasingly out of work, as Bob Herbert's Aug. 10 column noted.
People must press Republicans and Democrats to offer solutions rather than tired rhetoric. Nor can business leaders merely carp on the sidelines. Too many companies needlessly export work once done in the United States to take advantage of cheap labor overseas. It must end, and companies that help end it should get tax breaks.
The country that put men on the moon in the 1960s has lost its way and can-do spirit. President John F. Kennedy once said: ''The American, by nature, is optimistic. He is experimental, an inventor and a builder who builds best when called upon to build greatly.''
It's time to re-engage American ingenuity, innovation and imagination and rediscover ''made in America.'' The jobs will follow.

HEADLINE: After Layoffs, Yonkers Is Trimming Curriculum

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
YONKERS -- Students here will return this fall to bigger classes, limited Advanced Placement options and a dearth of electives in drama, music, cooking and industrial arts because there are fewer teachers to go around.
The Yonkers school district is scaling back its curriculum and programs in the wake of 187 layoffs -- 90 of them teachers -- and an additional 250 retirements, which have reduced the staff by more than 10 percent.
''It's challenging,'' said Edwin Quezada, a high school principal who has revised his class schedule at least 100 times since the budget-cutting began in March. ''It makes you feel really bad to say, 'We're not offering that anymore.' ''
While budget problems are nothing new for Yonkers, this is the first time since 2004 that the district has laid off a significant number of teachers. The 25,000-student district, the fourth-largest in the state, does not have independent taxing authority and must rely almost entirely on state and city financing even during tough economic times. 
This year, state and city aid to the Yonkers schools dropped by $3.5 million. At the same time, the district faces an additional $10.6 million in expenses this school year from utilities, supplies and growing enrollment -- as many as 800 more students are expected this fall. It also faces a $12 million increase in retirement and health care costs and a $16.5 million increase in employee raises.
All of which has put Bernard P. Pierorazio, the superintendent, in a tough spot.
''It's been so painful for me because I've been through the process,'' said Mr. Pierorazio, who was laid off as a young social studies teacher in Yonkers in 1976 and hired back a year later. ''I know how devastated I was when the principal came to me.''
Yonkers is not alone in making hard choices this year, as school districts across the region and the nation struggle to rein in spending and balance budgets. This month, the federal government approved $26 billion in aid to school districts and states to prevent layoffs of teachers and public employees.
But the measure comes after many districts have already cut their staff and programs. (Not New York City, though, which averted layoffs of thousands of teachers after withholding across-the-board pay increases for teachers and principals for the next two years.)
In New Jersey, where a majority of school budgets were rejected by voters in the spring, Woodbridge laid off 100 teachers, or nearly 10 percent of its teaching staff. As a result, elementary schools will lose their reading coaches, and art classes for gifted and talented students will disappear, said John Crowe, the superintendent.
In the New York suburbs, 9 out of 10 districts in Westchester and Putnam Counties have eliminated jobs through layoffs and attrition since late spring. That is a sharp turnaround for a region where school officials have been hiring for much of the past two decades to keep pace with growing enrollments.
''If you're going to have to cut costs, it's where you're going to get the dollars,'' said Lisa Davis, executive director of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association.
Still, teachers -- if not other employees -- were largely spared in some districts. In New Rochelle, which had its first layoffs in years, 7 of the 42 people let go were teachers. The rest were 30 teaching assistants, an administrator, two school nurses and two clerks.
Yonkers has lived with cuts, and the threat of cuts, for decades, even as the student population has grown with an influx of immigrants. While Yonkers has performed better on state tests than Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, it has lagged behind New York City and the rest of the state.
This year, 39.2 percent of Yonkers students in grades three through eight passed state English tests, compared with 42.4 percent in New York City and 53.2 percent statewide. In math, 41.5 percent of Yonkers students passed, compared with 54 percent in New York City and 61 percent statewide.
About 58 percent of Yonkers students graduate from high school in four years, compared with 71 percent statewide, according to state statistics.
Mr. Pierorazio said he had sought to avoid layoffs by calling on all 4,000 employees to agree to a one-year wage freeze, but union leaders did not agree. In July, the Yonkers City Council passed a $484.1 million school budget for 2010-11, down $2.9 million from the year before. (Mr. Pierorazio added that if Yonkers received additional federal aid, he might be able to rehire some teachers who were laid off.)
''I think he's doing the best with what he has,'' said Annmarie Smith, president of the Yonkers Council of PTAs. ''Yonkers is shortchanged.''
Ms. Smith said art and music programs had never fully recovered after the 2004 layoffs. She added that her two daughters, teachers in the Bronx and in Philadelphia, had not sought work in their hometown because they could not be assured that they would have jobs from one year to the next.
With a smaller staff, Yonkers has increased class sizes up to 34 students, from an average of 24 in elementary schools and 26 in high schools. There will be 100 fewer aides to help out in crowded classrooms, and far less art and music instruction. Instrumental music will disappear at elementary and middle schools.
At Mr. Quezada's school, Lincoln High, which is known for its business program, there will be 10 fewer accounting, finance and marketing classes after nine teachers, including two specializing in business, were let go. The school will also drop at least three Advanced Placement courses, in statistics, politics and Spanish literature.
''Here you are trying to send students to all these good colleges,'' Mr. Quezada said. ''But if you don't present them with a solid transcript, it's not going to happen.''
Students and parents echo Mr. Quezada's concerns. Louis Marquez, 17, recently protested the layoffs at City Hall. ''It's our school, it's our future,'' he said. ''Now that they're gone, kids are not going to know what to do. They're going through the college process without their help.''
Teachers have already gotten a taste of larger class sizes. To save money, the district hired seven fewer summer school teachers, and increased the size of some classes up to 36 students.
In algebra on a recent morning, Gina Garcia drew algorithms on a chalkboard, trying to interest 34 students, some of whom looked bored or sleepy. Ms. Garcia, a teacher at Yonkers High School since 2001, said she was preparing for larger classes this fall because two of her school's math teachers were laid off.
''When we have so many kids in one classroom,'' she said, ''the level of apathy is going to rise, because they're not going to think they're important. They're going to feel like they're just a number.''

HEADLINE: Warnings of More Floods Add to Pakistan's Misery

BYLINE: By SALMAN MASOOD and KEVIN DREW; Salman Masood reported from Islamabad, and Kevin Drew from Hong Kong. Waqar Gillani contributed reporting from Punjab Province.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Pakistan issued new flood warnings on Thursday that could last into the weekend as government and relief agencies strained to confront the toll from a growing humanitarian disaster.
The new warnings to several cities in Punjab and Sindh Provinces added to the desperation of many across the country facing a daily struggle for survival as Muslims around the world began to observe the holy month of Ramadan.
On Thursday, President Asif Ali Zardari, who came under stinging criticism for making a trip to Europe as the disaster unfolded, made his first tour of flood-damaged areas since his return to the country this week, beginning with Sukkur in Sindh Province, news reports said. 
The United States Embassy in Islamabad announced that two Marine helicopters had arrived in the country, the first of a contingent of 19 American military helicopters that has been ordered to assist the Pakistani government in relief efforts. The United States has pledged $71 million for flood relief, and American officials have called for more.
''Americans have been very focused on other, equally heart-wrenching issues, like Haiti,'' Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said Wednesday at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''I hope they will turn their attention as well to this extraordinary crisis that Pakistan is facing.''
The aid deliveries could help the United States improve its image here and blunt a growing anti-American sentiment. The Taliban have already urged Pakistanis to shun American aid and have used the crisis to expand their influence and outreach in the flood-affected areas of the northwest.
The United Nations has estimated that at least one-fifth of the country is flooded, but the scope of the damage seems far greater. About 14 million people have been affected by the floods, and 6 million of them are children, according to Unicef. Estimates of the dead have ranged from 1,200 to 1,600.
Beyond the daily rising toll of the dead, displaced and starving, experts assessing the crisis said much remained to be learned of the short-term relief needs and the longer-term economic challenges that Pakistan was facing from the floods.
Entire villages and towns remain underwater. Conventional travel around Pakistan has been disrupted because roads and bridges have been washed away.
''It's very difficult because we have not been able to access all areas,'' said Dr. Irshad Shaikh, an expert on such crises with the World Health Organization. ''To be frank, we do not yet have a countrywide picture'' of the need for aid.
On Thursday, flood alerts went out to several cities in Punjab and Sindh. Muzaffargarh, a city in southern Punjab Province, looked like a ghost town after more than 80 percent of its population left because of flooding fears. Hundreds of residents moved to makeshift encampments along a road to the city of Multan.
One resident, Muhammad Farooq, said he chose to remain in Muzaffargarh to protect his house from theft while his family went to Multan.
''We are helpless and praying to God that our city is saved, as the threat is still there from the River Chenab,'' Mr. Farooq said.
About 400,000 people were evacuated in Muzaffargarh and outlying areas, said Suhail Tipu, a government official coordinating the relief and rescue operation. Dozens of villages and towns in the area were flooded by waters from the Indus River, he said.
In Sindh Province, local officials braced for floodwaters threatening to inundate the city of Jacobabad on Thursday night, said Ghulam Ali Shah Pasha, chairman of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Sindh. About 300,000 people had to be evacuated from the Kashmor District in Sindh, he said.
''There are 450 relief camps across Sindh,'' Mr. Pasha said. ''We are providing cooked meals. The biggest problem is that most of the people don't want to go to relief camps. They have tribal enmities and cultural sensitivities.''
Across Pakistan, relief workers have made priorities of needs like food, water and shelter, while health workers focus on preventing diseases. The government and relief agencies are sending emergency tents, mosquito nets, food, water-purifying tablets and cholera prevention kits.
Dr. Shaikh of the World Health Organization said health risks included diarrhea and skin and respiratory infections, while immunization efforts had begun against measles and polio.
Although it is too early to determine how Pakistan's economy will be affected, early reports appear grim. Citing agricultural officials, the newspaper Dawn reported Thursday that the floods had destroyed about 500,000 tons of wheat and as many as two million bales of cotton.
At the request of Pakistan's government, the World Bank has joined with other agencies, including the Asian Development Bank, to assess the damage to the country's economy, said Shahzad Sharjeel of the World Bank office in Islamabad.
The assessment period may take another week or two, Mr. Sharjeel said. He noted the World Bank had already provided $1.3 million in emergency grants.
Flooding began on July 22 in the province of Baluchistan. The swollen waters then poured across the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province in the northwest, formerly the North-West Frontier Province, before flowing south into Punjab and Sindh. The United Nations appealed this week for $460 million in emergency aid. The appeal came after donors had already pledged an estimated $150 million.
''The magnitude of this crisis is unprecedented'' in Pakistan, Dr. Shaikh said. Many people who depend on the land and animals for survival had their livelihoods simply washed away, he said.
After the Kashmir earthquake in 2005, relief workers had access to some resources. ''Here, everything is gone -- crops, livestock, homes, communities,'' Dr. Shaikh said. ''There is nothing for people to fall back on.''

HEADLINE: Wendy's, Missing Forecast, Lowers Its Annual Outlook

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The fast-food operator Wendy's/Arby's Group lowered its 2010 earnings forecast and posted lower quarterly profit on Thursday.
In addition, its revenue missed Wall Street expectations as same-store sales at its Arby's roast beef sandwich restaurants tumbled. The company reported that sales at Arby's North America restaurants open at least 15 months fell 7.4 percent in the second quarter. 
While the result was among the weakest reported by a large fast-food chain, it improved from the first quarter's 11.5 percent drop.
Wendy's/Arby's reported second-quarter net income of $10.7 million, or 3 cents a share, down from net income of $14.9 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier.
Wendy's and Arby's were suffering from neglect before their $2 billion merger in September 2008. They are trying to catch up with rivals in restaurant appearance, operations, menu variety, value and international expansion.
Arby's has tightened operations and introduced a value menu to help it better compete with chains like Burger King and Jack in the Box, which also are grappling with high unemployment among the young people who make up their core customers.
Wendy's, which has fared better, reported a 1.7 percent fall in sales at established North America restaurants for the latest quarter, when it emphasized items like $2.99 value meals.
Roland C. Smith, Wendy's/Arby's president and chief executive, said he expected Wendy's sales at established restaurants to turn positive this quarter. Wendy's August and September results should get a bump from its new salads and value promotions like 99-cent spicy chicken nuggets, he said in a conference call.
Wendy's, which highlights its use of fresh ingredients, was a pioneer among fast-food chains when it introduced Garden Sensations salads in 2002. It added four new salads nationwide in July and plans to reintroduce a breakfast menu across the United States in late 2011.
Wendy's/Arby's forecast 2010 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to fall 3 percent to 5 percent from 2009. It previously forecast a low- to middle single-digit percentage rate increase in adjusted earnings.
While Arby's expects same-restaurant sales trends to improve from 2009 levels, executives repeated their call for a full-year decline. Wendy's same-restaurant sales were expected to be flat versus a year earlier.
Shares in Wendy's/Arby's fell one cent, or 0.2 percent, to close at $4.14 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Pessimism in Asia Despite a Strong Earnings Season

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG
PROFIT for Samsung Electronics surged 83 percent in the latest quarter. Toyota and Sony both swung to profits after wretched quarters a year earlier.
Asian companies have been on a tear, but this may be as good as it gets. Despite a stellar round of earnings for the last quarter, the outlook for many of the region's companies -- household names around the world -- is dimming.
The headwinds are manifold. The United States risks a double-dip recession, and possibly even an era of deflation, and Europe's debt crisis continues to nag.
Closer to home, the Japanese economy lives perpetually in the dumps, a situation made worse this week by a rise in the yen to a 15-year high against the dollar. And growth in China, a major force of the Asian and global economies, is beginning to slow. 
As Asian companies release their earnings, executives are signaling a markedly less optimistic note.
''With intensified competition throughout the digital media and mobile industries going forward,'' said Robert Yi, vice president and head of investor relations for Samsung, of South Korea, ''it may become a challenge to maintain current profitability levels.''
Toyota reversed a net loss of 194.8 billion yen ($2.2 billion) in the April-June quarter of last year, posting an almost equally large profit for the same quarter this year. Despite lingering fallout from the recall of millions of vehicles, the Japanese carmaker also raised its outlook for the full business year that ends next March, and said sales, in Asia in particular, were soaring.
Still, Toyota's managing director, Takahiko Ijichi, cautioned: ''We note a lack of visibility concerning currency movements and the possible backlash in demand after the end of the demand-stimulus programs in Japan, which requires our close monitoring.''
Alibaba.com, a leading Chinese e-commerce company, reported a 46 percent rise in profit on Tuesday, more than analysts had expected. But the company warned about future performance, despite remaining upbeat about the outlook for e-commerce and the company. ''We continue to take a cautious view on the global economy and small-business development,'' said David Wei, Alibaba's chief executive, ''and expect a slowdown in export growth for the following quarters.''
Many economists say that Asia has generally become more isolated from the ups and downs of economic cycles in the United States and Europe.
But that does not mean companies there are immune. ''Ultimately, we are still in a world where consumption is happening primarily in Europe and the United States,'' said Beat Lenherr, chief global strategist at LGT Capital Management Singapore. ''China is not in that league yet.''
In addition, analysts caution, developing Asian economies are still largely driven by manufacturing, which is volatile and highly vulnerable to any slowdown in orders from overseas.
''Most Asian companies depend on strong sales growth in order to maintain earnings,'' Mr. Lenherr said. ''If, or when, we get a slowdown in growth, you're likely to see earnings disappoint again very quickly.''
The region's greatest economic liabilities may well be the largest economies: Japan and China.
Japan stands out for its slow growth. While growth in developing nations like Indonesia and India surges, the Japanese economy is expected to grow only about 2.4 percent this year.
Deflation and an aging population make it hard for Japanese companies to grow at home and led companies like Sony and Toyota to introduce stringent cost-cutting measures as the economic crisis intensified.
Japanese export giants like Nintendo, Honda and Canon also face major problems from the strong yen, which has gained 10 percent in the last three months, making Japanese goods much more expensive for American consumers.
This has helped send the Nikkei 225-share average, the main Japanese stock market index, down 13 percent so far this year.
On Thursday, Japanese officials warned about excessive moves in the currency. ''We will monitor economic conditions carefully and respond appropriately,'' the finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said at a news conference in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg News.
''Excessive and disorderly movements in currencies can be harmful to the stability of the economy and financial markets,'' Mr. Noda was quoted as saying. ''I would like to monitor foreign-exchange rates with great interest and extremely carefully.''
In China, the economy has been booming and is expected to overtake Japan's as the world's second-largest, after that of the United States, sometime this year. With expansion projected at about 10 percent this year, a population of 1.3 billion and a government that is able to throw billions of dollars into economic stimulus measures, China is now a major engine of global growth.
But recent statistics have shown the pace of growth moderating over the last couple of months as the authorities' efforts to cool the economy have taken hold, and analysts widely expect that trend to continue in coming months.
The Shanghai composite market, which is largely closed to foreign investors, has sagged 21 percent since Jan. 1, making it one of the world's worst performers this year, along with Greece's.
Mainland investors, analysts say, have lost their appetite for stocks, unnerved by Beijing's efforts to slow the pace of the economy and tamp down price rises, which have been especially high in the real estate sector.
Most mainland Chinese companies have yet to report earnings for the most recent quarter, but in a sign that consumer demand for big-ticket items like cars is ebbing, the automaker BYD recently cut its annual sales target for this year by 25 percent. Another carmaker, Chongqing Changan Automobile, said that sales in July had fallen 7.4 percent from the level of a year earlier.
Economists in Asia stress that the softer economic data represent a slowdown rather than a collapse, and many, in fact, welcome them as a sign that the Chinese economy is edging away from the danger of overheating.
''Chinese household-sector demand for consumer durables is nowhere near saturated,'' said Eric Fishwick, head of economic research at the brokerage firm CLSA in Hong Kong.
But with a small government welfare net, Chinese consumers are also big savers, which makes it difficult to depend on them to pick up the slack when demand in Europe and the United States slumps.
There are reasons for optimism, however. Two economies in Asia have been performing unexpectedly well: those of India and Indonesia.
''India and Indonesia between them have 1.4 billion people, who will also have a tremendous appetite for cheap consumer durables,'' Mr. Fishwick said.
So far, the earnings news has been good throughout Asia. Cathay Pacific Airways and Singapore Airways, among the region's top airlines, reported earnings that topped expectations. In South Korea, Hyundai Motor's earnings for the April-June quarter rose more than 70 percent from the level of a year earlier. In mainland China, the Internet company Sina beat analysts' expectations with sharply higher earnings. The British banks Standard Chartered and HSBC both reported rapid growth in Asia, which accounts for much of their business.
The good news has not translated well on the stock market, however.
As long as global investors -- who account for much of the trading in Asian assets -- remain nervous about the pace of global recovery or about the prospect for further economy-cooling measures by China, stock markets in Asia will probably shrug off good economic and earnings news.
''Global markets are more strongly correlated than ever,'' said Stephen Davies, chief executive at Javelin Wealth Management in Singapore.
The Singapore economy is expected to be one of the world's fastest-growing this year. But the Straits Times index there has risen only 1 percent so far this year -- little more than the Dow Jones industrial average in the United States, which went into the red for the year on Wednesday.
The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 3.5 percent since Jan. 1, even though the city's economy has also rebounded.
The Sensex in India has risen a bit more than 3 percent, despite that country's buoyant economy.
''Asia's economies have decoupled from the rest of the world, but their financial markets have not,'' said Andrew Freris, an investment strategist at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong. ''There is a big disconnect between their economic performances and their stock markets.''

HEADLINE: Win Wars? Today's General Must Also Meet, Manage, Placate, Politick and Do P.R.

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After nine years of fighting in the deserts and mountains of the Middle East, the military has concluded that the traditional, hard-earned combat skills that allowed generations of ''muddy boots'' commanders to protect American interests around the world simply are not enough to assure victory in today's wars -- or career advancement through the top ranks of the armed forces.
Mastery of battlefield tactics and a knack for leadership are only prerequisites. Generals and other top officers are now expected to be city managers, cultural ambassadors, public relations whizzes and politicians as they deal with multiple missions and constituencies in the war zone, in allied capitals -- and at home.
The increased demands help to explain how the two most recent American commanders in Afghanistan, among the most respected four-star officers of their generation, lost their jobs. And they are prompting the military to revamp the way it trains and promotes its top officers. 
''They must be 'pentathlete' leaders,'' said Gen. David H. Petraeus, the senior commander in Afghanistan. As Iraq and Afghanistan have proved that a commander must stretch to master nuances of international alliance accord, local governance and tribal politicking, the military has revamped its training ranges and its curriculum.
Strong scores in mock battle in the deserts of California or in swampy Louisiana are no longer the lone measurement. Fake villages with irascible, faux tribal leaders and proxies representing the competing agendas of government agencies and nongovernment organizations are all in play to test a commander's expanding set of required skills.
But senior officers admit it is much harder to figure out how to prepare their most senior commanders for managing relationships with civilian masters in Washington, especially if popular support is waning for both the strategy, and the wars themselves.
In an acknowledgment that the top jobs have become ever more intellectually challenging, physically exhausting and politically bruising, senior officers confirm that the armed services are looking to exactly this broader set of skills as they fit their future four-stars with the mask of command worn by Washington and Grant, Marshall and Eisenhower.
Perhaps no general is in a better position to assess the new challenges of command than General Petraeus, who was sent to Afghanistan by President Obama to replace Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who was relieved as the allied commander there after Rolling Stone magazine reported remarks he and his aides made that were critical or even disparaging of civilian leaders in Washington. And General McChrystal was placed in the job when the Obama administration shifted strategy, and removed Gen. David D. McKiernan.
Just as in Iraq, General Petraeus has been ordered to salvage a war effort, this one having suffered from a shortage of resources after being relegated to a sideshow war for years.
In a telephone interview from his headquarters in Afghanistan, General Petraeus said the shifting demands of counterinsurgency and coalition warfare presented an array of intricate management challenges.
In a previous assignment, General Petraeus ran the Army's schoolhouses at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., central to the effort to transform the ground force from preparations for what he called ''The Clash of the Titans'' -- heavy armor-on-armor warfare -- to better succeed in today's counterinsurgency fight, which focuses as much on protecting the civilian population and enabling local governments as it does on troops killing enemy fighters.
To that end, he led efforts to write a counterinsurgency manual -- a blueprint for the wars today -- and also a new guide on Army leadership that ''tried to come to grips with all of these attributes needed in leaders in full-spectrum operations,'' General Petraeus said.
Those complicated tasks, he acknowledged, also must be conducted under ''the magnifying glass that is applied to them by a 24-hour news cycle.''
General Petraeus will be under that magnifying glass as analysts wonder whether historians who lament that Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires may have gotten it only partly right -- and whether, for the American military, Afghanistan may likewise become the symbolic graveyard for the careers of generals, too.
Which is not to say that past commanders of major theaters of war had it easy.
When Eisenhower was European commander in World War II, he had alliance politics to manage, as well as the enormous egos of his subordinates.
But, said Kori Schake, a Hoover Institution research fellow who has held senior policy positions at the National Security Council and at the Departments of State and Defense, Eisenhower's mission was far more straightforward.
''His orders were to invade Europe, conquer Germany,'' she said. ''He was asked to defeat another uniformed, organized national army. In comparison, part of the reason we are struggling with the wars today is that military force cannot so easily achieve the complicated, sophisticated set of second-order effects we are asking it to achieve.''
The speed of war has increased. Not only have the missions and goals in both Iraq and Afghanistan shifted over the years of combat, Ms. Schake said, but in advance of D-Day, the United States government summoned ''thousands of economists and captains of industry'' to plan the occupation. Today, though, ''Responsibilities for things that are not traditional areas of military expertise -- reconstruction and economic development -- have migrated into the military realm,'' Ms. Schake said.
To oversee that broad and expanding portfolio requires a theater commander to establish a wide range of relationships not demanded of previous officers, said David W. Barno, a retired lieutenant general who was ordered to establish a new, three-star headquarters in Kabul in 2003, a command he held for 19 months.
''I no longer could rely just on relationships inside the military,'' said General Barno, now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a nonpartisan policy institute. ''I had to tremendously expand my network to include other parts of government -- the embassy there and senior players at Usaid -- and start and then grow relationships with members of the host government to get anything done. And not to forget allies, Capitol Hill, the media.''
Adm. William J. Fallon held two of the military's most prestigious theater commands, in charge of American forces in the Pacific and then the Middle East, before he retired early after making public statements on Iran, Iraq and other issues that seemed to put him at odds with the Bush administration.
''A key difference from earlier times of command is the available amount of information and the demand on time that presents,'' Admiral Fallon said. ''With this 24/7, 365 demand cycle, you lose the opportunity to sit back and think, to take stock of what is important and what is distracting -- and that is an incredible burden on a senior leader.''

HEADLINE: Many Chicago Charter Schools Run Deficits, Data Shows

BYLINE: By SARAH KARP. 
Sarah Karp is deputy editor of Catalyst Chicago, an independent publication on urban education. For more information on charter schools visit catalyst-chicago.org.

 BODY:
Even as the Obama administration promotes charter schools as a way to help raise the academic performance of the nation's students, half of Chicago's charter schools have been running deficits in recent years, an analysis of financial and budget documents shows, calling into question their financial viability.
On Monday, Chicago Public Schools released a bare-bones budget that included a cut of about 6 percent in per-pupil financing for charter schools -- to $5,771 from $6,117 per pupil for elementary school students and to $7,213 from $7,647 per pupil for high school students. The cuts are a result of shrinking tax revenue and lagging support from the strapped state government. The city's 71 charter schools, which enrolled 33,000 students last year and expect to enroll another 10,000 in the 2010-11 school year, stand to lose $15 million under the cuts.
It is difficult to compare the cuts with those that are being made at traditional schools because those schools do not receive money on a per-pupil basis, but district officials said they tried to make the amount of cuts comparable to those being made at traditional schools. 
As a result, charters will become more dependent on private donors to provide the extras -- more counselors, smaller classes, longer school days and up-to-date technology -- that charter operators say set their schools apart from traditional public schools.
But even though Chicago's charter schools brought in $21 million in private money from foundations, corporations and wealthy individuals in 2007 -- the last year for which complete information is available -- half have run an average of $700,000 in deficits in recent years, with some of the shortfalls reaching $4 million, according to an analysis of Chicago Public Schools data by Catalyst Chicago, an independent magazine on urban education.
The data showed that two-thirds of the schools could not cover core expenses, like salaries, facilities and overhead, without private money. A third needed private money to fill more than 20 percent of their budgets. A recent study by Ball State University found that Chicago's charter schools depend far more on private financing than those in other big cities, including Boston, Miami and New York.
Robert Runcie, chief administrative officer for Chicago Public Schools, said the district needed to take a ''serious look'' at the fiscal health of charters and was developing a system for stricter oversight. Four Chicago charters have been shut down since the 1990s largely because of financial problems.
Charter schools, which receive public money but are run by private for-profit and nonprofit organizations, were established to foster innovative educational practices by freeing the school from state and local regulations, for example, the requirement that all teachers be state-certified.
Chicago Public Schools officials and national education experts say that charters, to be considered fiscally sound, should be able to cover all their general operating costs with public money. If charters raise private cash, it should be just for additional programs, said Greg Richmond, president of the National Association of Charter School Authorizers.
Advocates of charter schools say inequitable public financing is the root of the problem. Charters are forced to rely on private money because they receive less public money than traditional schools, said Larry Maloney of the Aspire Educational Consulting Company in Washington, D.C., one of the authors of the Ball State study.
''The question is, are we intentionally setting up charter schools to fail?'' he said.
Opponents of charters blame the financial problems of the schools on the expense of extra bureaucracies. In addition to principals and assistant principals, the schools often have executive directors and financial officers on staff, all of which cost extra money.
''I think the charter school system was always built on a house of cards, and once the economy took a dive, it would crumble,'' said Jackson Potter, staff coordinator for the Chicago Teachers Union and co-chairman of the Caucus of Rank and File Educators, which now leads the union.
Union leaders have vigorously fought charter schools, which they consider privatization of public schools and a way for school districts to abandon their responsibility to children. Charter schools also have mostly nonunion teachers, although teachers at two charters in Chicago have recently formed unions.
President Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan, a former Chicago schools chief, view charter schools as a way to spur innovation in public school systems that they say are too resistant to change. States that do not allow charters or restrict their replication jeopardize their chance to receive federal financing, Mr. Duncan said last year. ''We want real autonomy for charters,'' he said.
Mr. Duncan has also pressed charter operators to take over failing schools under the so-called ''turnaround'' strategy, which involves replacing the entire staff of existing schools.
Charter schools are a centerpiece of Chicago's Renaissance 2010 strategy, which was started in 2004 by Mayor Richard M. Daley and Mr. Duncan, who was then the chief executive of Chicago Public Schools. The program's goal is to close failing schools and replace them with new ones, including charters.
The initiative has been controversial from the start, and charter finances are not the only concern. New schools have been spread unevenly across the city, and half of the 25 neighborhoods considered most in need of better schools have yet to get them.
In addition, teacher turnover at charters is high: Catalyst Chicago's analysis of charter teacher lists found that half of teachers left from 2008 to 2010, a rate comparable to that in many of the most troubled district-run schools.
Charter school operators say teacher turnover can be good if it means that bad teachers are being fired. But education experts say that high turnover is often a result of poor working conditions, and charter teachers typically work longer hours for less pay than teachers in traditional schools. Experts also say high turnover causes an unstable learning environment.
Educators have said the real test of charters is whether they are driving improvement in public schools. The Catalyst Chicago analysis showed that most charter schools in the city outperform traditional schools in their neighborhoods, but only eight have reached the higher state average for student achievement.
A host of national studies have found that charter-school performance is mixed and, on the whole, no better than that of traditional public schools.
Charter operators say that there are other measures besides test scores. This year, a handful of the charter high schools called attention to the fact that almost all their students got into colleges.
Around the Calumet campus of Perspectives Charter School on Chicago's South Side are posters and murals with the motto ''College For Certain.'' To reach that goal, Perspectives has college counselors dedicated to taking students on college tours and helping them navigate the journey from poor South Side neighborhood to leafy college campus.
In May, the school celebrated its first graduation, with 96 percent of the class having been accepted to at least one college, the school reported.
But the 6 percent cut in Chicago Public Schools spending on charter schools is going to make it increasingly difficult to fulfill the promise of college, said Rhonda Hopps, chief executive of Perspectives, which operates five schools. The proposed cuts would mean $710,000 less, based on current enrollment, to hire the additional college counselors Perspectives had planned to add. Ms. Hopps said she would try to find volunteers to fill the gap.
''I am worried about the direction of the cuts,'' said Ms. Hopps, who joined Perspectives last spring as the school's first chief executive. Her major task, she said, is to raise money.
Beth Purvis, the executive director of Chicago International Charter Schools, the city's largest charter operator with 13 schools, said her board of directors believed that ''public education should occur with public money.''
Leaning on outside sources might work in the short term, while charters are still the toast of the philanthropic community, Mrs. Purvis said, but the strategy may not work in the long run.
''We don't want to just be in a community for 15 to 20 years,'' she said. ''We want to be in a community for 50 to 100 years.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about the financial viability of Chicago's charter schools gave an outdated statistic for the percentage of students at Perspectives Calumet High School who had been accepted to at least one college. It is now 96 percent, up from 70 percent in March.

HEADLINE: For the Everglades, a Dream Loses Much of Its Grandeur

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- In the end, Gov. Charlie Crist's effort to buy huge swaths of sugar company land for the Everglades restoration was just too much: too much money, too much land to handle, and too much of a fight with critics and the courts.
A vote on Thursday by the South Florida Water Management District -- to scale back the deal for a third time -- is expected to finally end negotiations, but it also amounted to an admission of overreaching. What began two years ago as a stunning $1.75 billion purchase of the United States Sugar Corporation and all its assets, including 187,000 acres of land, is now set to close in October at a fraction of its original size, with 26,790 acres being sold for $197 million. 
Eric Buermann, chairman of the advisory board at the water district, which will buy and manage the land, said the end result was simply a product of economics. ''This is what we can afford to bite off,'' he said.
But to some degree, the deal has also been defined by shortsightedness. Internal records and interviews show that the governor and the district repeatedly underestimated the purchase's financial and environmental complications, leading to the costly suspension of projects with more immediate benefits, and to the alienation of potential partners.
Ultimately, they left the Everglades with delays in exchange for majestic dreams, now unlikely to be realized.
It all got started with the desire for a single act that would save one of the world's most treasured wetlands, along with its endangered plant and animal species. When Mr. Crist, standing at the edge of a man-made wetland in June 2008, announced the proposed deal, he called it ''the holy grail'' of restoration. And indeed, there was a lot of potential. Scientists have long maintained that there is nothing the Everglades -- hurt by more than a century of dredging and development -- needs more than space to store and clean water.
Never before had so much land north of Everglades National Park been made available, and the ecosystem was desperate: an $8 billion plan to save the Everglades, approved by President Bill Clinton in 2000, had been faltering for years.
But over time, it became clear that other motivations were also in play. Putting United States Sugar out of business appealed to environmentalists who had been feuding with the company, as well as to the governor, a moderate, who was eager for publicity in his quest to become Senator John McCain's vice-presidential running mate.
In the fizzy moment of negotiations, little thought seemed to have been given to affordability, or to long-term plans. What would the state do with all the company's farm equipment that was among the assets? What about the thousands of rural Floridians who would eventually be put out of work when farming stopped on United States Sugar's 187,000 acres?
Mr. Crist was immediately inundated with complaints from the counties that would be affected. Farmers and local officials lined up at public meetings during the next year to demand an economic plan. ''Please don't let us down,'' said Mali Chamness, the mayor of Clewiston, the small town where United States Sugar has been based since 1931.
The next deal, unveiled on Nov. 11, 2008, was smaller: a $1.34 billion purchase of just over 180,000 acres. The assets were no longer included and Mr. Crist called the new deal ''miraculous.'' But to truly restore the north-to-south ''river of grass'' from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, land swaps with a competing company, Florida Crystals, would be necessary. The swaps fell through before negotiations were able to get off the ground, in part, interviews show, because United States Sugar did not want a competitor involved; the governor went along.
When dwindling tax revenues led to a third deal -- a proposed $536 million purchase of 72,800 acres announced in April 2009 -- Mr. Crist made it clear that he wanted the deal approved when he replaced two of the district's board members, including a vocal critic. Yet once again, he had misjudged the road ahead: the district's financial advisers said the purchase threatened vital water supply operations, and this year judges in two federal lawsuits demanded that state and federal officials do more to improve the Everglades' water quality.
The smaller deal, according to the district, is in part an effort to address those lawsuits. ''It's a very strong signal that we're heading in the right direction,'' said Shannon Estenoz, a board member.
Governor Crist, in a statement praising the vote, quoted the philosopher Lao Tzu: ''The longest journey begins with a single step.''
For many, the smaller acquisition -- with an option to buy more land later -- brings a sense of relief. With the larger deals, ''there was a concern that we were going to spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to make things work,'' said Eric Draper, executive director of Audubon of Florida. He called the deal approved Thursday a success because the district can afford it, and the land can be used for restoration relatively quickly.
Yet for critics (including some new arrivals from the Tea Party), it is still too much, too late. Dexter Lehtinen, a lawyer who has been involved in several lawsuits pushing for Everglades restoration since the 1980s, said the district was ''taking money that could be spent on projects and spending it on land acquisition.''
Rosa Durando, a longtime environmentalist who has been demanding specific solutions since the first deal was announced, said she was still not satisfied. ''I see a lot of pie in the sky,'' Ms. Durando said, ''but I don't see how it would work on the ground.''

HEADLINE: Deal Allowing Company to Put Video Slots at Aqueduct Paves Way for City Casino

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
After nearly a decade of false starts, squabbling and investigations, Gov. David A. Paterson and legislative leaders have approved a deal to bring casino gambling to New York City.
The agreement this week, among the governor and the leaders of the State Senate and State Assembly, gives Genting New York, a subsidiary of the largest gambling company in England and Southeast Asia, the right to install 4,525 video slot machines at Aqueduct racetrack in Queens. If the state attorney general and the state comptroller approve the deal in the coming days, work could start next month, and the slot machines could be running within a year.
A crucial factor in the deal was Genting's promise to pay a $380 million licensing fee upfront, giving the state money that it desperately needs. Genting says Aqueduct will generate more than $1.5 million a day in tax revenue for the state. 
The company says it will turn the aging grandstand at Aqueduct into a ''showcase,'' with a three-story atrium at the entrance, a luxurious gambling area, high-end restaurants, a climate controlled sky bridge to the nearby subway station and a shuttle to John F. Kennedy International Airport.
''We're trying to create a first-class, day-trip destination casino, not slots in a box,'' said Jay Walker, a senior consultant to Genting New York's Malaysian parent company, Genting Berhad.
Genting's renderings show a two-story gambling hall with a third floor set aside for large events, but which could also be used for table games like roulette, blackjack and poker, should the state allow them. State Lottery officials have said they would like to introduce electronic versions of those games, although many gamblers find them less desirable than the real thing.
Genting's deep pockets -- its new $4.4 billion Sentosa resort in Singapore generated a ''shockingly favorable'' $370 million in cash flow in its first quarter, according to Union Gaming Research, a gambling investment firm -- make it a considerable force as gambling has become highly competitive, with state after state legalizing it.
There are 25 casinos or slot parlors within 100 miles of Aqueduct, which sits on 192 acres in Ozone Park. But it would be the first video slot parlor in the city. More than 1.5 million people live within five miles of the racetrack, and more than 5.6 million are within 10 miles.
''There are very few opportunities like Aqueduct now or in the future,'' said Michael J. Pollack, managing director of Spectrum Gaming Group, a consulting company. ''It'll be the first casino in New York City. That's enormous.''
Gambling opponents who once wielded clout have been effectively sidelined, conceded State Senator Frank Padavan of Queens, a leading critic. Mr. Padavan, a Republican, considers gambling a tax on the poor and an industry whose social costs, including addiction, outweigh any growth in jobs or tax revenue.
''The state had a golden opportunity to develop meaningful assets such as shopping malls and affordable housing, things that would have permanent value,'' he said Thursday. ''But government is hell bent on expanding gambling in the state.''
The Center for an Urban Future recently issued a report suggesting that it made more sense economically to redevelop Aqueduct for office space and a cargo complex serving the airport.
''Aqueduct has been losing customers and revenue for years now,'' said Jonathan Bowles, the center's director. ''I'm skeptical that adding video slot machines will turn it around.''
New York authorized video slot machines at Aqueduct and eight other racetracks in 2001, after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center left the state's economy in tatters. Other tracks, including Yonkers Raceway, just north of the city, quickly set up the machines. But the first effort at Aqueduct failed when the original sponsor, the New York Racing Association, declared bankruptcy in 2006.
After plans for Aqueduct were derailed a couple more times -- one company failed to come up with its promised $370 million payment -- Governor Paterson, a Democrat, selected a consortium in January called the Aqueduct Entertainment Group from among six bidders. But the State Lottery ruled that the group did not qualify for the franchise, and the state's inspector general is now looking into whether the group, which included the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, a former Democratic congressman, should have been selected at all.
Lottery officials then opened the latest competition, asking potential bidders to comply with a stringent set of conditions and a minimum upfront payment of $300 million. Genting was the only company that met the conditions.
Tim Rooney Jr., general counsel for Empire City at Yonkers Raceway, which has 5,300 video slot machines, said he did not mind the competition but questioned Genting's willingness to spend on Aqueduct without regard for the bottom line. ''Either they're not concerned about making a profit and they're willing for Aqueduct to serve as a loss leader,'' he said, ''or they don't understand the market.''

HEADLINE: Taxes No Longer So Certain

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
Death may still be certain, but taxes have never been less so.
United States taxes may soar next year, or they may not. The estates of some very wealthy people who die this year may save hundreds of millions in taxes, but those of merely wealthy people may leave their heirs in much worse shape than if the person had died last year. Or Congress could try to retroactively change that.
Taxes on corporate dividends are in line to soar next year, while those on long-term capital gains will rise, but less abruptly. Virtually everyone will pay higher income taxes if the law is not changed.
The current situation is absurd, a monument to George W. Bush's determination to cut taxes by the maximum amount possible and to Congressional unwillingness to compromise either in 2001 or now. 
Virtually no one, save for Alan Greenspan, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, thinks it would be a good idea to let current law stand. Mr. Greenspan says he is worried about budget deficits, while other economists are worried about choking off growth.
It is possible that something will happen on Capitol Hill before the election, but it increasingly appears that if anything is to be done before tax rates rise -- as the ball falls in Times Square at midnight on New Year's Eve -- it will be done in a postelection lame-duck session.
Even then, there is a potential for deadlock as Democrats, who are sure to control the White House next year, and Republicans, who hope for large gains in Congress, insist on their own solutions and argue that any failure to act is the fault of the other party.
''We're in a big game of chicken now,'' said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center in Washington.
There is already talk that all this could devastate financial markets and the economy, which has seemed to be slowing after a good start to the recovery earlier this year.
If it appears that nothing will be done in Washington, companies are likely to take matters into their own hands. With the tax rate on corporate dividends, now 15 percent, set to rise as high as 39.6 percent in 2011, some companies no doubt will accelerate planned 2011 dividend payments and make them before the end of 2010.
With the maximum rate on long-term capital gains set to rise to 20 percent, from 15 percent, the pressure to take capital gains this year rather than next may not be as large, but it will be present. That could lead to selling of stocks, bonds and even real estate on which investors have profits to realize.
Since the government is always willing to allow people to incur a tax liability, there are no restrictions on immediate reinvestment in the same security, as there are when a capital loss is realized. So if you want to take profits on shares that you wisely bought early last year, you can do so and then immediately repurchase the shares.
If enough companies and investors do such things, government tax revenue will be unexpectedly high for 2010, and then suffer the following year.
It seems obvious to say that higher taxes discourage economic growth and hurt investments, and that lower taxes do the opposite, but it is not as simple as that, as James Grant noted in the current issue of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. He pointed out that taxes were raised in mid-1932 -- with the top marginal tax rate rising to 63 percent, from 25 percent -- on the theory that lower government deficits would increase confidence. By then the stock market, and the economy, were near their Depression lows. It was a great time to invest, if anyone had any money left.
Similarly, Republicans forecast disaster when the Democratic Congress and President Bill Clinton raised taxes in 1993, and forecast rising prosperity when taxes were cut in 2001. Both forecasts were wrong.
From the end of 1993 through the end of 2000, the American economy grew at a compound annual rate of 3.9 percent. Since then, the average rate has been 1.6 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose at a compound rate of 13.1 percent a year during the first period, assuming reinvestment of dividends. Since then investors have not even broken even. Of course, there is no way to know what would have happened had tax laws not changed in those years.
It was the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that produced the current absurd situation. But it is no credit to the Democrats that they did nothing to fix the system -- and reduce uncertainty -- in the last two years when they held the White House and had majorities in both the House and Senate.
In 2001, the law as passed called for income taxes to rise to their pre-2001 levels at the end of 2010. The estate tax would be phased out, and end entirely in 2010. After that, it would bounce back to 2000 rates and rules.
That was not done because anyone thought it would be good tax policy to raise rates in 2011. Instead, under an obscure Senate rule, it was possible to pass such a bill with fewer votes than would be required for a permanent cut. In addition, the 10-year math used in budget calculations looked better if it could be assumed that tax rates would rise in 2011.
Such arithmetic alchemy was not really needed then. Democrats were not determined to block any tax cut, and enough votes to meet the Senate rule could have been found with a permanent tax cut that was smaller, but not necessarily a lot smaller, than the one that was adopted.
But Republicans were in no mood to compromise that much if they did not have to, and Mr. Greenspan's statements at the time were typically Delphic but seemed to support the cuts.
Budget forecasts at the time were for surpluses, even with lower taxes. It turned out those predictions were based on bad assumptions about tax receipts, in part because of a lack of understanding about the extent to which the 1990s stock market boom had inflated tax revenue. Spending forecasts did not assume that two long wars were about to be fought.
Now forecasts are for huge deficits. Those forecasts could be similarly wrong if the economy is able to return to stronger growth. The chances of that happening do not, however, seem to be increased by raising everybody's taxes just now.
When the Bush tax laws were passed, there were jokes about the ''Dr. Kevorkian provision,'' named for a doctor then notorious for assisting patients in committing suicide. The idea was that as the final days of 2010 approached, the children and grandchildren of superwealthy people would be encouraging them to go quickly to save on taxes.
Those were jokes then. Even a year ago, few thought Congress would fail to act long before now.
In 2009, there was estate tax only on estates over $3.5 million. And that figure covered the value of estates after deducting bequests to spouses and charitable contributions. Next year, if current law holds, the exemption will fall to $1 million. Amounts over that, not including the charitable contributions and spousal bequests, will be taxed at rates up to 55 percent, compared to 45 percent in 2009.
Some still think Congress could retroactively change the estate tax law for 2010. If it did so, the action would certainly be challenged in court.
Repealing the estate tax was not good news for some estates of people who died in 2010. That is because the repeal also limited the step-up in tax basis for inherited property.
Until 2009, and next year as well if current law remains in effect, any property passed on to heirs gets a tax basis based on value at the time of death, not original cost. But this year, estates can step up value only on $1.3 million of assets that are left to someone other than a spouse.
The result is that heirs to estates with more than $1.3 million of taxable bequests, but not a lot more than $3.5 million, are likely to end up worse off this year than they would have if the person had died in 2009.
Getting the data on original cost will not be easy for some heirs. If your father died this year and left you 10,000 shares of I.B.M. stock, and those shares were not part of the $1.3 million in assets whose value was stepped up, then your tax basis is what he paid. Any sale by you will produce a large -- and taxable -- capital gain.
As to whether those shares are included in the $1.3 million, it is up to the estate executor to determine which assets are stepped-up in basis. That could lead to hard feelings, not to mention lawsuits, among heirs.
For the ordinary income tax, marginal tax rates now range from 10 to 35 percent. If nothing is done, they will revert to a range of 28 to 39.6 percent. The Tax Policy Center estimates that effective tax rates would rise for all income groups, with the largest increase on those with the highest incomes.
President Obama wants to return the estate tax to 2009 levels, and renew the tax cuts for all but the highest-income taxpayers. He wants to tax both dividends and long-term capital gains at 20 percent rates.
Most Congressional Republicans want to renew all the tax cuts, although some would be willing to reinstate estate taxes. There has been talk of extending income tax cuts for two or three years, setting up another potential battle then.
Congressional partisanship and hesitation to compromise across party lines seemed high in 2001. Now there is much less willingness to compromise. Logically, the parties should at least be able to pass the cuts -- from planned 2011 levels -- that virtually everyone agrees are wise.
But there is no guarantee that such logic will prevail.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 14, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The High & Low Finance column on Friday, about the uncertain status of tax law, misstated the maximum amount of assets whose value can be ''stepped up'' to current values for heirs of those who die in 2010. It is $1.3 million, not $1 million. The column also misstated the lowest marginal tax rate if ordinary income tax rates revert to 2000 levels on Jan. 1. It is 15 percent, not 28 percent.

HEADLINE: They'll Do It for Nothing

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Atlanta.

 BODY:
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- Politicians seeking to placate angry voters this election cycle might take a cue from Robert Bentley, a retired dermatologist and the Republican nominee for governor in Alabama.
Mr. Bentley has offered an accountability measure that would tie his pay as governor to his performance, saying he will not take the office's $113,000 salary until ''Alabama reaches full employment'' -- or a 5.2 percent jobless rate (it was 10.3 percent in June). His proposal has struck a chord with voters amid shrinking budgets, fears of lingering recession and the clamor of concern that government is both wasteful and unrestrained.
Many politicians work without a salary, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California. Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay who is running for governor in California, has promised not to take a salary as well. 
But such candidates are usually among the ultrarich, who presumably would barely notice the trickle of a public official's salary into their bank accounts. Not so Mr. Bentley. While certainly well off, he said he and his wife had mortgaged their home and dipped into their retirement savings to lend his campaign more than $1 million before he pulled off a surprise win last month in the Republican primary runoff.
Forgoing a salary ''would be a financial burden because, you know, I don't have any other job, other than my retirement,'' Mr. Bentley, 67, who is a state representative, said after speaking to the Rotary Club of Birmingham on Wednesday. But he wanted to show solidarity with people across the state who are looking for work. ''I've been poor, I grew up poor, I've been without money, without a job, and I identified with them,'' he said.
Other politicians, at all levels of government, have come up with similar proposals.
''I think it's an indication of many officials realizing how bad it is for their constituents, and it also buys officials a lot of really good P.R.,'' said Jessica Levinson, director of political reform at the Center for Governmental Studies, a nonpartisan research group in Los Angeles. ''That makes it a lot easier for officials who are going to have to deliver bad news to their constituents.''
In Columbia, S.C., the new mayor, Steve Benjamin, has allotted half of his $17,500 salary for bonuses to employees who come up with ways to save the city money.
Katrina Swett, a Democrat who is running for Congress in New Hampshire, says she will take the same salary representatives were paid in 2000, the last time the federal budget was balanced. The rest -- about $30,000 a year, she said -- would be returned to the Treasury. Ms. Swett said it would be a sacrifice for her because she and her husband have three children in college.
Voters respond ''incredibly positively'' to the promise because it shows commitment to their concerns, Ms. Swett said. ''The thing that infuriates so many people about Washington is how disconnected they are from normal people's lives.''
In Dumfries, Va., a newly elected city councilman, Jerry Foreman, was forced to clarify his promise not to take a salary during his four-year term, saying that he would decide each year if his conditions, like lower taxes and an end to employee furloughs, had been met.
Not all candidates have been aided by such pledges. Ned Lamont, who ran for governor in Connecticut this year, is a multimillionaire who said he would not accept a paycheck until the state's $3 billion deficit was eliminated. He lost the Democratic primary on Tuesday.
In Alabama, a spokesman for Mr. Bentley's Democratic opponent, Ron Sparks, the state agriculture commissioner, argued that Mr. Sparks's proposal to cut executive salaries by the same percentage that state revenues decline would save more money than Mr. Bentley's salary pledge.
But voters remembered the pledge, saying it helped take Mr. Bentley from virtual unknown to nominee.
''If he really will do what he says he's going to do and put the people of Alabama back to work, and not take a salary until he does, that says a lot,'' said Linda Walfield, a hospital worker in Birmingham.
But Janice Taylor, a nurse who said she would most likely vote for Mr. Bentley, said the salary issue still seemed like a gimmick.
''I don't think people look at the governor having a salary as anything wrong,'' Ms. Taylor said. ''We're worried about how he's going to manage the government.''

HEADLINE: Team Insights? Just Use Your Peripheral Vision

 BODY:
This interview with George S. Barrett, chairman and chief executive of Cardinal Health, a health care services company, was conducted and condensed byAdam Bryant.
Q.Talk about some important leadership lessons for you.
A. I had an injury going into my senior year of high school that required major surgery, and it caused me to miss my senior soccer season. Almost every college recruiter dropped off the map. Sports had been at the center of my life, and this was my first big setback. It was a real test of my resilience. I recovered and went on to play college soccer, but a reinjury during my junior season in college ended my athletic career.
I was sort of bitter for a while, which is not really in my nature. I think I blamed my coach for a lot of things, when in fact this was really about me and my injury. I had to deal with it, and I had to move on.
I came out of it with a different perspective, and I discovered that I had other talents that maybe I could dig more deeply into. I was able to explore my passion for music, which actually led me to pursue a professional music career for a while. So I found that there was another side of me. 
Q. What about leadership lessons in business?
A. I was running a company that was acquired by a bigger firm. I stayed with them after the acquisition, and then I got a call from the chairman and he said: ''We're having some issues with our flagship company. Would you be willing to come in and run it?'' I was 34 years old, and I said to myself: ''Well, it's already struggling. How badly could I mess it up?'' So I went there.
Everyone on the management team was in their 50s, so the first day I was introduced to them, I thought they were going to collapse. You could sort of see them thinking, ''That kid?''
I realized I was going to have to win these guys over pretty quickly. I also knew that there were some folks in that group who were probably not going to come along for the ride. It was a turnaround, so I knew that I was going to have to move quickly to fix some things.
Q.So how did you handle that transition?
A. I was very clear and direct about what I thought we were facing and what we needed to do about it, without blame. I had to create an environment in which people knew it was their job to tell me things that we needed to do because we were going to run out of time. I tend to be very direct. I expect people to be that way with me.
Q. How did you assess the existing management team?
A. I concluded fairly quickly that not many of them would be staying. I'll tell you one specific story. We were having some pretty significant compliance issues. So I spent some time looking through all this data and working with one executive who had responsibility for this key area.
About three months into it, I sat him down, and I said, ''Look, I think it's probably time for us to part ways.'' I said: ''You haven't disagreed with me once. You haven't challenged me, nor have you really been comfortable bringing me bad news, and that's what I need.''
There were some very capable people there, but I just think the employees had lost confidence in them. That's very hard to recover, because so much of leadership is about trust and belief. People have to believe in you. And when they stop believing in you, you can say all the things in the world, but it's very, very hard to mobilize an organization when they've lost that belief.
Q. How long did it take to size up whether someone was staying on the team?
A. It was about watching them, and watching the organization respond to them. I'll give you an example. We're sitting with a large group of folks, about 40 to 50 managers, and people are standing up to raise certain issues.
And I watched this one executive. People were watching and riveted to him, really listening and engaged. And then this other executive spoke, and I watched him address the group, and I watched everyone's eyes. And their eyes went back down to their tables. They couldn't even meet eyes with him. It was a clear signal that said, ''You've lost us.''
So sometimes you don't know what the messages are that you're going to get, but you have to look for them. They come from your peripheral vision. And that was one of those cases where I just knew it the second it happened.
Q.Any surprises in the top job?
A. I think later on in my career there were. As you take on leadership roles of larger organizations with higher profiles, there are things that come with that that you're not always ready for -- realizing that every word that you say means something. If you use the word ''may'' instead of ''might,'' people think, ''Well, were you telling us something?'' So there was this sudden awareness of the need to be clear and careful about every symbol.
When you're younger, and when you're leading a smaller group or organization, it's really more about the actions. You touch everything directly. You communicate with everybody directly. As you get into leading a bigger organization, you can't touch everything directly, and so what you do carries symbolic weight. Often that's the power of words, but sometimes it's other things.
Q.Like what?
A. Well, it's often the little stuff. My days are jammed, like any other person who does what I do. It takes a lot of time for me to actually go over to the building where our cafeteria is and eat there, but I try to go there often just to see people. I get a chance to talk to people who actually are doing the work every day and that I rarely get to see.
So little symbols like that matter. What do you spend your money on? When you first arrive into your position, do you spend a lot of money on new office furniture? These things seem trivial. Economically, they may not be important, but they are symbols.
Q.Talk about how you hire.
A. By the time a person sees me, they've been screened for technical competence. So I'm really looking for fit. I think every organization has its own unique footprint and brand. Cardinal Health's organization really values humility. They don't want people coming in and telling them how to do things and showing off. They want folks who they really enjoy being around, who demonstrate a competence in a more modest and humble way. So you have to know your organization.
Q.What questions do you ask?
A. I ask questions to try to get at a person's nature. What are they really all about? Not just, what were their experiences, but how do they think? How do they operate? How do they lead? How do they interact? How do they deal with adversity? I try to look at how those pieces will fit together, and then I try to find someone I want to be around.
You know, we work incredibly hard. It's nice to be with people you want to work with. That doesn't mean, by the way, you have to be going out to dinner every night or that they're going to be your best friend. But it has to be someone you have a fundamental connection to in some way, and you trust them.
I really encourage them to ask questions. What they're curious about tells you a lot about who they are, and that's sort of the most fun part of the interview for me. And it also tells you a little bit about what they're interested in. It probably tells you how well they understand your company. And it tells you a little bit about their comfort with you. Are they really willing to ask a hard question?
Q.What would you say to a new senior executive you've just hired who asks, ''What's it like to work for you?''
A. I'm going to trust you to do your work. I expect you to be unbelievably committed. That doesn't mean that if you've got a kid who's got a softball game at 3 p.m. you don't run to it, because that's really important. That's a part of life.
I also let them know that I'm very direct. You have to be comfortable with very direct feedback. I'm going to be very engaged. I'm going to probe and prod. It's like a Socratic method with me. I'm going to continue to push on you. It's part of the way I function. It's part of the way I get information and I get understanding, and it's also the way that you'll share your thoughts with me.
I count on you to set high goals, and I expect you to be incredibly direct with me. I'm not much of a micromanager, but if I am not confident we're going the right direction I'll be very engaged with you. I like to have fun in my work, and I expect it's O.K. for you to do the same. And we work really hard, and we have a really good time together.
Q. What about career advice?
A. Find the environment in which you thrive. You can put a great plant in the wrong soil and it's not going to grow, and it's true for all of us.
Q. What's your philosophy of leadership?
A. Articulating it in a single sound bite is hard for me, but I'd say this. I do think leadership is largely about trust, and trust has a couple of dimensions. It starts with competence. People have to believe that you really know what you're doing. They have to really trust in your judgment because the data is so complex out there that they have to believe you can see through all the silliness and have some sense of the right course.
People have to trust that you have a point of view about what this enterprise is going to look like. What do we seek to be? And they have to trust that you understand them, that you get them. Not necessarily that you know them personally, but you understand what it's all about to work here and that you have their interests at heart. I think that when you can do those things, it can be a powerful combination.
I think people sometimes equate leadership with charisma and decisiveness. I think those are powerful tools, and I hope I have both, but they're not to be confused with leadership. I know a lot of very charismatic people who lack judgment and competence, and they're not great leaders. They're just fun to be around. And I know some very decisive people who lack judgment, which is terrifying.
Also, I think a leader has to be comfortable with having the weight on their shoulders. And that's not for everybody. It can be hard, and it's a different experience if you haven't had to experience this. That's not for everybody, but I like it because I don't feel like I'm alone. I wind up bringing the group together, and we own the weight. I love that part of it.
I also believe that leadership is a two-way street. I tell my team, ''I expect to learn from you as well as you'll learn from me.''

HEADLINE: Cleaner, Healthier Air

 BODY:
Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed a stricter nationwide health standard for smog-causing pollutants that would bring substantial benefits to millions of Americans. With a final rule expected by the end of this month, crucial senators, mainly from industrial and oil-producing states, are pushing back. They say investments required to produce cleaner air are too expensive and not scientifically justified. 
Lisa Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, needs to stick to her guns. This is only the first of several political tests to come this fall, as she also seeks to tighten rules governing individual pollutants like mercury and global warming gases like carbon dioxide.
The health standard she is proposing covers ground-level ozone, commonly known as smog, which is formed when sunlight mixes with pollutants from factories, refineries, power plants and automobiles. Ozone is a major health threat, contributing to heart disease and various respiratory problems.
Ms. Jackson's proposal -- to reduce the permissible level of smog in the air from the current 75 parts per billion to between 60 parts per billion and 70 parts per billion -- is sensible, no matter what industry's defenders may claim. It had been recommended by the agency's independent scientific panel but rejected by the Bush administration, which proposed a weaker standard.
Industry will have to make investments in cleaner power plants, and new technologies may be required. As it is, about half the counties that monitor ozone levels are not yet in compliance with current standards, let alone the proposed standard.
Fears about burdening industry raised by critics like George Voinovich, a Republican of Ohio, and Mary Landrieu, a Democrat of Louisiana, cannot be dismissed out of hand, especially in the middle of a recession. But the health benefits, E.P.A. says, far outweigh the costs, and the time frame for compliance is generous.
States must submit plans showing how they will reach the new standards by 2013; the standards will then be phased in over the next 17 years. That is enough time for human ingenuity and technology to rise to the occasion and ensure that the air we breathe is a lot safer.

HEADLINE: Judge Revokes U.S.D.A. Approval of Modified Sugar Beets

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
A federal district court judge revoked the government's approval of genetically engineered sugar beets Friday, saying that the Agriculture Department had not adequately assessed the environmental consequences before approving them for commercial cultivation.
The decision, by Judge Jeffrey S. White of Federal District Court in San Francisco, appears to effectively ban the planting of the genetically modified sugar beets, which make up about 95 percent of the crop, until the Agriculture Department prepares an environmental impact statement and approves the crop again, a process that might take a couple of years.
The decision could cause major problems for sugar beet farmers and sugar processors. In the past the sugar industry has warned there might not be enough non-engineered seeds available. However, the judge ruled that crops currently in the ground can be harvested and made into sugar, so the effects will not be felt until next spring's planting season. 
Beets supply about half the nation's sugar, with the rest coming from sugar cane. Sugar beet growers sold the 2007-8 crop for about $1.335 billion, according to government data.
The decision came in a lawsuit organized by the Center for Food Safety, a Washington advocacy group that opposes biotech crops.
Judge White ruled last September that the Agriculture Department's approval of the beets violated the National Environmental Policy Act, but he did not specify a remedy. Earlier this year, he denied a request by the plaintiffs to prohibit the planting of the engineered seeds this year, saying that would be too disruptive. But he warned farmers to move toward using conventional seeds.
In his order Friday, the judge granted the plaintiffs' request to formally vacate the approval of the beets. That would bar farmers from growing them outside of a field trial.
But Judge White denied the plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction that would have also banned the growing of the crops. He said an injunction was not necessary if the crop was no longer approved for commercial planting. .
A decision by the United States Supreme Court earlier this year in a similar case involving genetically engineered alfalfa essentially precluded the granting of an injunction.
In the alfalfa case, the Supreme Court indicated that the government might grant partial approval of a genetically modified crop. It seems that such an option might be available in the sugar beet case as well, which could reduce any hardship for farmers. It is also possible the Agriculture Department will appeal.
Caleb Weaver, a spokesman for the Agriculture Department, said Friday night that the department was ''looking at the decision to figure out what's appropriate as the next step.'' Monsanto declined to comment, saying it would defer to sugar growers and processors.
Duane Grant, a sugar beet farmer in Rupert, Idaho and chairman of the Snake River Sugar Company, said he had not seen the decision and could not assess its impact.
But Mr. Grant, who had intervened in the case, added, ''I'm pleased that the crop that is currently planted would be allowed to be harvested and processed. That's clearly in the best interest of the public.''
Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of the Center for Food Safety, said the ruling was another sign the Agriculture Department was not doing its job. ''This is regulation by litigation,'' he said.
The ruling followed a hearing held earlier Friday in Judge White's courtroom.
The Agriculture Department and its allies had argued that the approval of the crop should not be revoked, saying the department's mistakes were not that serious and that the crop was going to be eventually approved anyway. At the least, they asked for a nine-month delay in revoking the approval to give the department time to put interim measures into place.
But Judge White disagreed, writing in his opinion that the Agriculture Department's errors ''are not minor or insignificant'' and that it had already had time since his initial ruling in September to put interim measures into place.
The judge said it was not clear legally if he could consider the economic consequences of revoking the approval, but that even if he could, the Agriculture Department had not adequately demonstrated there would be a severe impact.
In his previous ruling, Judge White said the department had not adequately assessed the consequences from the likely spread of the genetically engineered trait to other sugar beets or to the related crops of Swiss chard and red table beets.

HEADLINE: Energy and Auto Sales Lifted U.S. Retail Sales in July

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retail sales managed a modest increase in July after two consecutive monthly declines, but the strength was concentrated in higher sales of autos and gasoline. Most other retailers saw their sales fall.
The Commerce Department said Friday that sales rose 0.4 percent last month, while sales excluding autos were up 0.2 percent. Both figures were slightly below expectations.
The broad declines outside of auto and gas sales offer more evidence of a slowing recovery. The concern is that spending will slow further in the second half of this year as households struggle with high unemployment and lackluster job growth. 
The July increase in retail sales followed declines of 0.3 percent in June and 1 percent in May. Sales had surged 2.1 percent in March but since that time consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the economy, has weakened.
The major bright spot was a 1.6 percent rise in sales of motor vehicles and parts. It was the best showing since a 6.6 percent surge in March.
Summer promotions and easier credit lured shoppers back to car buying in July. The industry sold more than a million cars and light trucks. That was 5.1 percent higher than in July 2009. Last year auto sales fell to the lowest level in three decades.
Sales at gasoline stations rose 2.3 percent in July, the biggest jump since last November. But much of that strength reflected higher gas prices. Excluding auto sales and gas, retail sales would have fallen 0.1 percent in July. That compares with a 0.2 percent increase in June when excluding autos and gasoline.
The July figures reflected widespread sales declines. Sales were down 1 percent at department stores and also dropped at specialty clothing stores, furniture stores, hardware stores and appliance stores.
In a second report, the government said consumer prices rose in July by the most since last August as energy costs increased for the first time in five months.
The Labor Department says the Consumer Price Index, the government's most closely watched inflation measure, increased by 0.3 percent in July, after three months of declines. Wall Street economists expected a smaller increase.
In the last year, consumer prices rose 1.2 percent, the department said. That was up slightly from last month's 1.1 percent pace but still a mild increase. The weak economy is keeping prices in check.
One small benefit of the weak economy is that it is keeping prices in check. Consumers are spending cautiously and saving more, which makes it harder for companies to raise prices.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the so-called ''core'' index increased by 0.1 percent in July, as the cost of housing, clothes, and used cars and trucks all rose. Core prices over the previous 12 months moved up by 0.9 percent for the fourth consecutive month. That was below the Federal Reserve's inflation target and is the slowest pace in 44 years.
July's increase in consumer prices may assuage concerns, raised in recent weeks by some Federal Reserve officials, that the economy is moving toward deflation. Deflation is a widespread and prolonged drop in the price of goods, real estate and stocks. It also reduces wages and can make it harder to pay off debts.
The country's last serious case of deflation was during the Great Depression.
Most economists do not believe deflation will happen. But they are watching consumer prices closely for any signs of it.
Meanwhile, tame inflation allows the Federal Reserve to keep the key interest rate it controls at a record low of nearly zero percent in an effort to bolster economic growth. The Fed usually fights rising inflation by raising rates.
Also on Friday, the Commerce Department reported that inventories held by businesses rose for a sixth month in June but sales declined for a second month.
Inventories increased 0.3 percent in June, but sales fell 0.6 percent after an even larger 1.2 percent sales decline in May.
The weakness in sales raises concerns about whether companies will continue increasing inventories. Inventory rebuilding had been an important source of strength driving the economic rebound.
Businesses had been rebuilding their inventories after slashing them aggressively during the recession. But if consumer demand weakens further, businesses could start cutting back. That would mean fewer orders to factories and weaker output for manufacturers.
The consecutive declines in sales in May and June followed 13 straight increases in total business sales. The June decrease reflected less demand for manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. A separate report Friday showed that sales at the retail level rebounded in July but the strength was concentrated in higher demand for autos and gasoline.
The 0.3 percent rise in inventories during June followed an increase of 0.2 percent in May. It reflected a rise in retail inventories of 0.8 percent and an increase of 0.1 percent in wholesale inventories. Stockpiles held by manufacturers slipped 0.1 percent in June.
The inventory to sales ratio edged up to 1.26 in June from 1.25 in May. That means it would take 1.26 months to exhaust inventories at the June sales pace.

HEADLINE: Rising Profits Are Good, but There's a Catch

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
PROFITS of corporate America have been rising at an impressive clip. But sales have not risen nearly as rapidly.
As a result, profit margins for companies in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks are now higher than they were before the recession began. 
When second-quarter earnings results began to be reported in early July, the higher numbers seemed to reassure investors, and the stock market advanced after two months of declines amid worries that the economic recovery was stalling.
But that reassurance has faded in the last week, in part because of more evidence that the American economy is not growing as fast as it had been, and in part because of indications that China, previously the strongest major economy, may be faltering.
While higher profits are normally deemed good news, it matters why they are rising. ''The same thing that caused the profit gains is squeezing now,'' Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.& P., said. ''It is the lack of jobs.''
With most companies in the S.& P. 500 having already reported second-quarter earnings, Mr. Silverblatt estimates that the overall index will show profits rising 8.9 percent from the same quarter of 2009. Sales rose 5.8 percent, which is the best showing in two years but not nearly enough to allow overall sales to approach the levels before the downturn.
As a result, the profit margin -- earnings as a percentage of revenue -- for the companies in the index is estimated at 8.9 percent in the second quarter, by far the best it has been since the boom ended and higher than it was in the 1990s, as can be seen in the accompanying charts.
The charts are based on S.& P.'s calculation of per-share figures for the index, which assigns figures from each company using the same weight that it has in the overall index. For most companies, the second quarter ended on June 30, but some companies report quarterly figures for other periods, and the figures include quarters ending in May and July as well.
The charts show profit margins for each of the 10 economic sectors in the S.& P. 500, for the second quarters of the last several years. Profit margins in information technology companies, which traditionally are strong, have improved, and so have profit margins in companies that make consumer items that, unlike things like food and paper towels, are considered to be discretionary purchases.
A large part of the gains, however, comes from the extraordinary turnaround among financial services companies. Two years ago they were losing money; now their margins are approaching prerecession, and prefinancial crisis, levels.
The bailouts helped some banks to survive, but the current course of monetary policy is also greatly helping. The cost of funds for banks is very low, and they can make much more than that on loans.
Mr. Silverblatt argues that a stronger recovery could, at least temporarily, lead to a decline in profit margins as companies begin to hire more people and make more investments, thus raising expenses.
At the moment, however, expectations for recovery are falling. ''If sales don't pick up, companies will not need to hire more,'' Mr. Silverblatt said. Falling consumer confidence figures, as well as disappointing reports on exports, have only reduced expectations for gains in sales.

HEADLINE: Proposals to Remedy Our Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Three recent articles on the Op-Ed page discuss our economic problems and the sufferings of our unemployed workers (''Defining Prosperity Down,'' by Paul Krugman, column, Aug. 2; ''A Sin and a Shame,'' by Bob Herbert, column, July 31; ''Welcome to the Recovery,'' by Timothy Geithner, Op-Ed, Aug. 3). 
Unfortunately, they offer few specific remedies. American manufacturers will not hire American workers while demand for their products is weak; and demand is weak because of the large unemployment itself, which in turn is largely because of the outsourcing of much of our manufacturing.
Yet three feasible remedies are still available:
Larger and longer federal payments in unemployment compensation, leading to more consumer spending.
Another big economic stimulus from the federal government, focusing on money for infrastructure jobs, job training and labor-intensive state operations.
Restraining the outsourcing of production by high taxes on foreign-earned profits or value-added taxes on imports.
These steps would not only provide jobs but would also revive the whole economy and lessen the threat of deflation.

HEADLINE: Penney's Profit Rises, but Its Outlook Falls

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The J. C. Penney Company posted an increase in second-quarter profit, but cut its profit outlook for the rest of the year, an indication that Americans, still worried about jobs, were not going to spend more any time soon. Penney said it earned $14 million, or 6 cents a share, in the quarter, reversing a year-earlier loss of $1 million, or break-even per share. Revenue in the period, which ended July 31, was down 0.1 percent, at $3.94 billion. Myron E. Ullman III, Penney's chief executive, told analysts in a conference call that retailers recognized earlier in the year that they would not be able to rely on the consumer economy to increase business, but now he says it could be a ''drag'' given the slowdown. Shares of Penney fell 98 cents, or 5 percent, to $19.82.

HEADLINE: Surprise Senate Candidate Faces Charges of Obscenity

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Alvin M. Greene, the unemployed veteran who surprisingly won the Democratic Senate primary in South Carolina in June, was indicted Friday on two obscenity charges by a Richland County grand jury, according to the state solicitor's office. 
The charges stem from accusations last year by a student at the University of South Carolina that Mr. Greene showed her pornography and tried to accompany her to her dormitory room. The charges will almost certainly complicate Mr. Greene's campaign against Senator Jim DeMint, the heavily favored Republican.
Carol Fowler, the chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, called on Mr. Greene to drop out of the race. ''It's very difficult for him to run with an indictment hanging over his head,'' she said, noting that this ''adds to his problems.''
Mr. Greene, 32, did not enter a plea in the case and did not answer any questions in a brief phone call on Friday.
''My lawyer is dealing with that, O.K., that's all,'' he said before hanging up. His lawyer could not be reached for comment, but a campaign adviser, Felipe Farley, said that Mr. Greene would not resign. ''The campaign is going forward,'' he said.
The first charge, of disseminating, procuring or promoting obscenity, is a felony and carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a maximum fine of $10,000. The second charge, communicating an obscene message to another person without consent, is a misdemeanor and carries maximum penalties of three years and $10,000.
David Ross, deputy solicitor for Richland County, said that if Mr. Greene decided to seek a trial, it would probably not occur before the Nov. 2 election but there was no clear time frame.
Mr. Greene's victory in the June primary had been puzzling: he did not campaign and was unknown to Democratic officials. Some said they suspected he had been a plant by mischief-making Republicans. Despite having qualms, the state Democratic Party, fearing a populist backlash, did not try to bump him from the ballot.
In July, state investigators determined he had done nothing wrong in obtaining the necessary $10,400 to run in the primary. No evidence of fraud ever surfaced.
Mr. Greene remains an unconventional candidate, making few public appearances and declining to explain his involuntary discharge from the military. But he has drawn intense national media coverage, is being followed by a documentary film crew and has developed a bit of a following. He now has a handful of advisers, and on Thursday night, according to The Free Times of Columbia, he gave a speech, though it lasted only 23 seconds.
Ms. Fowler, who had called on Mr. Greene to drop out of the race shortly after he won the primary, said after Friday's indictment that lawyers advised the party that it could not remove him from the ballot unless he resigned.
Either way, Mr. DeMint appeared well positioned for re-election, which is why no Democrat considered a serious contender ran for the nomination in the first place.

HEADLINE: Rules Bar Banks That Violate Sanctions

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department released new regulations on Friday that could bar foreign banks or companies from accessing the financial system in the United States if they did business with entities or people subject to United Nations and United States sanctions. 
The regulations, which grew out of legislation Congress passed in June, effectively bar foreign banks from doing business in dollars if they engage in transactions with anyone suspected of involvement in Iran's nuclear or missile programs. The entities include Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
The regulations were released just months after the passage of new sanctions on Iran by the United Nations Security Council and the European Union. The European Union sanctions include additional measures aimed at Iranian banks and insurance companies and the Iranian transport sector. Administration officials have said they believe that the sanctions have already started to have an effect.
The Treasury regulations prohibit or impose strict conditions on the use of American bank accounts by any institution that engages in activities associated with Iran's nuclear and missile programs.
Those activities include aiding the Iranian government's efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction or to support terrorism, aiding the activities of people already subject to United Nations sanctions and providing any financial assistance to Iran's Revolutionary Guards or their affiliates. A final provision is aimed at banks or companies that engage in money laundering or assist any Iranian financial institution -- including the Central Bank of Iran -- in the activities cited.
Earlier sanctions focused on some of those activities, but violators were subject mostly to fines. The threat of being cut off from the United States economy adds a significant dimension, said Stuart A. Levey, the under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, in a briefing for reporters on the regulations.
Mr. Levey planned to leave Friday on a trip to the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and other Middle Eastern countries to explain the regulations to officials of government and financial institutions.
''It would not be in our interest to act without warning,'' he said. ''We're more interested in changing behavior than in 'getting' somebody.''

HEADLINE: Few Guarantees for Revis, And That's the Problem

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

 BODY:
The constant chatter surrounding the Darrelle Revis contract negotiations quieted down Friday. There were no radio interviews, no television segments. Even Jets Coach Rex Ryan declined to comment.
Silence, if only for one day, marked progress.
That said something about the acrimony that had increased this week. There was Woody Johnson, the Jets' owner, on ESPN television and radio, lecturing awkwardly on N.F.L. economics. There was General Manager Mike Tannenbaum on HBO's ''Hard Knocks,'' looking forlorn, saying, ''I feel like a failure.''
There was even one bizarre exchange. Johnson asserted he had been rebuffed in his efforts to meet with Revis, whose representatives countered that they would meet with the owner any time. Revis's agents called the Jets' stance a blatant lie. Ryan called the supposed blatant lie a blatant joke, then suggested that Revis, a cornerback who has three years remaining on his contract, and company head to training camp for a town-hall-style negotiation in front of the whole team. 
So it went.
This theater of the absurd had nothing to do with negotiations, of course. In fact, it only seemed to deepen the disdain between the agents and the team, who have a long, contentious history at the bargaining table (see: Pete Kendall and Chris Baker).
Mostly, it overshadowed the main point of disagreement: what constituted fully guaranteed money. Portions of contracts can be guaranteed against deteriorating skill (a player is paid even if his performance declines), injury (a player is paid even if he sustains a career-ending injury), or both. The Jets have guaranteed portions of their offers against injury. Revis's agents want those portions guaranteed against both injury and declining performance.
The Jets believe their last two offers covered all ground.
Offer 1: long term, 10 years, $120 million, with roughly $40 million guaranteed against injury, as first reported by The Daily News.
Offer 2: short term, a roughly $4 million raise from Revis's $1 million salary this season, after which negotiations would presumably resume. Before the sides agreed Thursday to keep negotiations private, Revis's agents, Neil Schwartz and Jonathan Feinsod, insisted that none of the Jets' offers contained a penny of fully guaranteed money or signing bonus. To be clear, they did not consider money guaranteed against skill or injury, as opposed to both, to be fully guaranteed.
The Jets predictably disagreed. Tannenbaum said earlier in training camp that the team would be flexible with how the deal was structured.
Labor uncertainty only adds to the complicated issue. Under what is called the reallocation rule of the collective bargaining agreement, any contract extension given during an uncapped season must fit under the 2009 salary cap, as ESPN New York reported. The Jets privately say they have little cap space left and cannot give Revis a lavish, guarantee-laden deal. But that argument ignores two important points. First, the Jets certainly knew the rule would apply when they approached Revis, not the other way around, to discuss an extension. Second, even with that rule in place, even with all the labor uncertainty, a signing bonus does not apply to the reallocation rule.
So, the Jets could just give Revis a sizable signing bonus, in the $25 million to $30 million range. The team would not even need to pay Revis with a giant Publishers Clearinghouse-type check for the full amount. They could defer payments, spread over four, five, six years or beyond.
The Jets would argue against that type of bonus for a player with three years remaining on his contract, particularly with the potential of a lockout next season, or potential new rules in the new deal with the players union.
But for all of Ryan's insistence that the Jets can win without Revis -- they are certainly packed with talent -- their very public Super Bowl expectations are much more realistic with Revis on the field. Many N.F.L. teams mostly use their top cornerback on an opponent's No. 2 receiver, then roll double coverage toward the No. 1.
Revis mostly marks the No. 1 receiver himself, leaving the defender who would have spent large portions of the game in double coverage free to blitz, or to cover someone else. That is what Ryan means when he says Revis is like adding a 12th defender.
Look at the Jets' first three opponents -- Baltimore, New England and Miami. Revis would cover Anquan Boldin, Randy Moss and Wes Welker (depending on situation), and Brandon Marshall. That is Revis's leverage.
Of course, this whole idea of ''outperforming'' contracts surely strikes some as greedy and misinformed. Actors whose movies do well at the box office and authors whose books sell beyond expectations do not rip up their contracts and start again. Vernon Gholston, the Jets' vastly disappointing former No. 1 pick, does not pay back part of his contract for underperforming, either.
But that argument fails to account for Revis's short earning period, or the fact that N.F.L. teams routinely discard players who do not perform, and those players lose all the money that was not guaranteed. It also overlooks why Revis holds such leverage -- his potential as a once-in-a-generation talent.
The guess here is that Revis and the Jets will work out a short-term solution before the season. There is too much at stake. For both sides.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall Again as the Recovery Looks Listless

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stocks fell for a fourth straight day Friday after new economic statistics reinforced a picture of a sluggish recovery in the United States.
The economic reports, on business inventories, retail sales and the Consumer Price Index, were in much the same vein as those that Wall Street had been seeing throughout the week, including trade deficit figures that raised the likelihood that the estimate for second-quarter growth of 2.4 percent would be revised sharply lower.
As earnings season winds down, traders are increasingly relying on the indicators for some hint of how the American economy is performing. ''But if you take the totality of the last couple of weeks, it is providing more concern over the strength of the recovery,'' said Paul Ballew, a former Federal Reserve economist and a senior vice president for Nationwide Insurance. 
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average, which went into the red for the year on Wednesday, was down 16.80 points, or 0.16 percent, at 10,303.15. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 4.36 points, or 0.4 percent lower, at 1,079.25 and the Nasdaq composite index was down 16.79 points, or 0.77 percent at 2,173.48.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 21/32, to 99 19/32, and the yield fell to 2.67 percent, from 2.75 percent late Thursday.
The Dow and the S.& P. were down more than 3 percent for the week, while the Nasdaq was down 5 percent.
Health care, technology and consumer discretionary stocks were 1 percent lower. Home Depot was down 30 cents, at $27.31, and Microsoft fell 9 cents, to $24.40. J. C. Penney was down 98 cents, to $19.82. Kohl's was down $1.51, to $44.99, and Nordstrom's fell $2.39, to $31.05.
''Frankly we are in a consumer-driven slowdown right now and there is not much we can do in the short term to change that,'' said Eric Beder, associate director of equity research for Brean Murray, Carret & Company. ''With consumers worried about keeping their jobs, and looking at potential tax increases next year, there is no real impetus to buy right now.''
''Right now there is tremendous uncertainty in the market,'' he added.
On Friday, retail inventories, which rose 0.8 percent in June, compared with 0.5 percent in May, were the latest indicator to point to weakening growth in the gross domestic product. Although an increase, analysts said that it was not enough to offset weaknesses in other sectors. Business inventories increased 0.3 percent in June over all, but sales fell 0.6 percent.
''This is further confirmation that the estimate of G.D.P. growth will be revised down,'' the chief United States economist at HSBC, Kevin Logan, said of the inventory numbers. He estimated that total inventories for the quarter would be $25 billion less than initial government assumptions.
In another closely watched report, retail sales rose 0.4 percent in July, slightly less than expectations of a 0.5 percent increase. It came after a 0.3 percent decline in June. But when subtracting volatile gasoline and automobile sales, retail sales fell 0.1 percent in July.
Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR, said that the retail data showed a deceleration in the economy.
''Our own view is that the labor market recovery will be a grudging one, that consumers will enjoy only small gains in wages and salaries for some time, and that consumer spending growth will therefore be modest at best,'' he said in a research note.
A statement Friday from the Commerce secretary, Gary Locke, underscored the administration's concerns about the economy. Mr. Locke said that the retail sales figures showed the economy was growing at a more modest pace than the administration would like.
''The administration understands that too many Americans continue to struggle,'' Mr. Locke said. ''President Obama and this department are committed to continuing to promote policies that foster job creation and a strong and sustainable economy.''
In a third report, the Labor Department said that the Consumer Price Index, which is considered a benchmark measure of inflation, rose 0.3 percent in Julyon a seasonally adjusted basis, and 1.2 percent in the last 12 months.
If the volatile energy and food prices are subtracted, the core index, which is used to gauge inflation, rose 0.1 percent in July, after rising 0.2 percent in the previous month. The 12-month change in the core index remained at 0.9 percent for a fourth month. The numbers were in line with market expectations.
''It is evidence of a slow recovery with quite a bit of slack in terms of capacity,'' Mr. Ballew said.
Consumer sentiment in August rose slightly above market expectations, to 69.6 in August, according to the Reuters and University of Michigan consumer sentiment index. It was 67.8 in July.

HEADLINE: German Growth Bolsters Its Stance on Recession

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Germany has sparred with its European partners over how to respond to the financial crisis, argued with the United States over the benefits of stimulus versus austerity, and defiantly pursued its own vision of how to keep its economy strong.
Statistics released Friday buttress Germany's view that it had the formula right all along. The government on Friday announced quarter-on-quarter economic growth of 2.2 percent, Germany's best performance since reunification 20 years ago -- and equivalent to a nearly 9 percent annual rate if growth were that robust all year.
The strong growth figures will also bolster the conviction here that German workers and companies in recent years made the short-term sacrifices necessary for long-term success that Germany's European partners did not. And it will reinforce the widespread conviction among policy makers that they handled the financial crisis and the painful recession that followed it far better than the United States, which, they never hesitate to remind, brought the world into this crisis. 
A vast expansion of a program paying to keep workers employed, rather than dealing with them once they lost their jobs, was the most direct step taken in the heat of the crisis. But the roots of Germany's export-driven success reach back to the painful restructuring under the previous government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder.
By paring unemployment benefits, easing rules for hiring and firing, and management and labor's working together to keep a lid on wages, Germany ensured that it could again export its way to growth with competitive, nimble companies producing the cars and machine tools the world's economies -- emerging and developed alike -- demanded.
Germans steered clear of the debt-fueled consumption boom that many believe contributed to the financial crisis. During the recession, Chancellor Angela Merkel resisted the palliative of government spending that the United States and some European partners felt was crucial to restoring growth.
The battle over how to navigate the financial crisis helps display Germany's emerging post-cold-war identity as a country less tolerant of foreign demands and lecturing, one with a tenser relationship with European partners. Though Germany has plenty of problems to grapple with at home, it has also become less obsessed with its historical crimes and more enthusiastic about its economic model, its culture and its improved standing in the world.
Jenny Wiblishauser, 33, a single mother in the southern town of Memmingen, said Germany's financial prudence -- and its willingness to ignore foreign criticism -- made her proud. ''Before, the Greeks would call us Nazis, and we would act vulnerable,'' she said. ''Now one says, 'Well, I'm not driving there for vacation.' ''
Some critics in Europe say that confidence veered toward hubris in the contentious debate this year over shoring up the Greek government and restoring confidence in the troubled euro. In particular, the venomous contempt in the German news media directed at Greece raised significant concerns among allies that a more assertive Germany had emerged, said Thomas Klau, an expert on European integration at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
''That was like a wake-up call to the rest of Europe that something had changed in Germany,'' Mr. Klau said.
In the process, the relationship between France and Germany has become fraught and mistrustful, calling into question the future of the project of European integration.
As the latest numbers show, Germany is outproducing its neighbors by wider and wider margins, raising fears of a two-speed Europe that could render the common regional currency unstable.
France's economy grew at just a small fraction of Germany's, 0.6 percent in the second quarter. Spain's economy grew an anemic 0.2 percent, while Greece's shrank 1.5 percent.
If policy makers in Berlin are right and the turning point has been reached, they will look wise. If the fragile recovery cracks, as worrisome signs of a slowdown in the United States and a cooling down of Chinese growth may augur, they could still bear the brunt of the blame for doing too little to foster regional and global growth.
Government officials here are confident they found the right approach, including a better solution to unemployment. They extended the ''Kurzarbeit'' or ''short work'' program to encourage companies to furlough workers or give them fewer hours instead of firing them, making up lost wages out of a fund filled in good times through payroll deductions and company contributions.
At its peak in May 2009, roughly 1.5 million workers were enrolled in the program. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recently estimated that by the third quarter of 2009, more than 200,000 jobs may have been saved as a result.
The German economy's comeback is visible in smaller towns like Memmingen, in the historic region known as Swabia. The brightly painted market square in this prosperous town is straight out of a German fairy tale, but it is beyond the medieval fortifications of the old town that Memmingen's part in the nationwide rebound of employment, which Chancellor Merkel has likened to a ''small miracle,'' took place.
After a record year in 2008, the family-owned firm Magnet-Schultz watched orders for its electromagnetic products plunge. Nearly one-third of the company's more than 1,500 workers in Germany were put on the short-work program. Only 57 were laid off.
The firm's chairman, Wolfgang E. Schultz, whose grandfather founded the firm nearly 100 years ago and whose son Albert joined as a vice president in January, said that his goal was to maintain the company in the long term by losing as few skilled workers as possible. He promised to try to rehire those who were let go when times improved. Forty of those workers have been rehired already.
German exports rose in June by 28.5 percent compared with the year before, the highest level since the financial crisis began to pinch in October 2008. The renewed boom for industrial companies like Magnet-Schultz has helped push the unemployment rate down to 3.4 percent in Memmingen, less than half the national average of 7.6 percent.
''The government took the right steps in extending the short-work program because it bridged a difficult situation,'' Mr. Schultz said in an interview.
From the start of the financial crisis, Mrs. Merkel has been the leading advocate of fiscal austerity, a view that won out at the Group of 20 meeting in Toronto in June when the leaders of the world's biggest economies promised to reduce their budget deficits.
Despite Mrs. Merkel's triumphs on the world stage, her government is struggling to reverse its plummeting approval ratings. Her stance reflects the will of a public that, despite the good economic news, remains stubbornly worried about the future.
The very sacrifices that have made German products more competitive and helped the country outpace its weaker, less disciplined European partners -- strict wage control, a retirement age rising to 67 from 65, lower welfare payments and eased hiring and firing -- have resulted in a deep feeling of insecurity.
Ms. Wiblishauser, the single mother in Memmingen, spent one month in 2006 on the scaled-back welfare program known as Hartz IV. Although working as an assistant tax consultant now, she said slipping back onto the rolls was her greatest source of dread. ''It gives you an existential fear,'' she said.
Germany's partners have cajoled, begged and demanded that the government in Berlin encourage more robust consumer spending, to combat imbalances among the countries that use the euro currency. But Ms. Wiblishauser said she found the prospect of spending to aid other European countries distasteful.
Like many Germans, Ms. Wiblishauser said she was having a hard time seeing the benefits the country received from being a member of the European Union. ''I would really like it if we were self-sufficient, like the Swiss,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Justin Bieber for President

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
Maybe we should just let the children run the country, at least until the recession is over. They appear to be the only people not bubbling over with anger, anxiety and frustration.
According to a Gallup poll released on Thursday, 70 percent of U.S. students in grades 5 through 12 say they are thriving, 63 percent say they feel engaged and 53 percent say they feel hopeful.
Adults are a bit more bitter. 
A CNN poll also released on Thursday found that 70 percent of adults describe themselves as angry and 69 percent think things are going badly in the country. In a NBC News/Wall Street Journal Survey also released on Thursday, 58 percent of Americans said they think that things in this country are ''off on the wrong track.''
Yes, I know, we parents have to pay for our children's unlimited cellphone packages so they can text until their thumbs are bigger than their forearms. And we have to pay the mortgage so they can continue to hang out in that filthy room with the pizza box under the bed. Meeting those obligations has us racked with worry now that the recession has sucked out our happiness like one of Harry Potter's Dementors.
But that's the problem. The recession has made us all so crazy and consumed by insecurities that we can't think straight. We're misbehaving like we're the children, and in many cases having to apologize for it.
Republicans are being sucked into the anchor-baby, anti-mosque vortex, scoring some short-term political points but dooming the party to long-term electoral annihilation. And it seems to me that the height of hypocrisy is that the same people who claim to be the last line of defense between the Constitution and our ''Kenyan'' president, wouldn't think twice about gutting that same Constitution like a fish to control and restrict those whom they see as ''other.''
Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary and mouthpiece of the concessional left, struck out at what he called the ''professional left'' for not singing Obama's every praise and swooning at his every action. Instead of offering an apology, he giggled and smirked about not having installed an inflatable chute in his office.
That was a reference to Steven Slater, the JetBlue flight attendant who blew a gasket and grabbed a couple brews, released the emergency chute on a plane and slid down into cult stardom.
Gibbs should have taken a lesson in apologizing from the radio talk-show host and raging homophobe Laura Schlessinger, who this week used enough N-words on her show to make Bull Connor blush. When the caller she was addressing objected to the usage, Schlessinger responded, ''don't N.A.A.C.P. me.'' The next day, she opened her show with an apology that began, ''Yesterday, I did the wrong thing.'' You think?
Representative Charles Rangel of New York took to the House floor this week and delivered such a melodramatic diatribe that I thought any moment he would start belting ''And I Am Telling You I Am Not Going'' from ''Dreamgirls.''
Then there's the Democratic state representative, Timothy Horrigan, from New Hampshire. After Ted Stevens, the former Alaska senator, was killed in a plane crash this week, Keith David Halloran, a New Hampshire Democrat, posted this message on his Facebook page: ''Just wish Sarah and Levy were on board,'' clearly referring to Sarah Palin and Levi Johnston.
To that, Horrigan responded: ''Well a dead Palin wd be even more dangerous than a live one ... she is all about her myth & if she was dead she cldn't commit any more gaffes.''
Seriously guys? I'm the first to say that I want to keep Palin as close to Russia and as far away from Washington as humanly possible, but debating the merits of her demise in a plane crash is heinous. Horrigan has since resigned.
One of the few lawmakers who seems to be having fun by acting like a child is Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey. He is scheduled to have a fund-raiser at Lady Gaga's ''Monster Ball'' tour stop in Washington on Sept. 7. Lautenberg is 86 years old, but there is no resisting a woman who once wore a see-through plastic dress with a giant silver lobster as a headpiece. Everybody loves lobster.
Another is John McCain, who seems to be flirting with the uber-tan ''Jersey Shore'' star Nicole ''Snooki'' Polizzi (after having bonded with each other over tanning salon taxes in June). Snooki was arrested for disorderly conduct last month. This week, McCain told a Phoenix radio station that ''I kind of think she might be too good-looking to go to jail.'' A wink, wink from the dashing 73-year-old with the wispy locks. One bit of advice to Snooki: Don't go to McCain's home base in Arizona. The state is hostile to people of your current complexion.
So, yes, I cast my lot with the actual children, and not because I think that they're Obama-conformists, either. They're not. In fact, they're even more harsh on the president than adults. An April poll of high school students published by Hamilton College found that ''70 percent of African-Americans in the survey give Obama a favorable rating, but the analogous number is only 21 [percent] for whites.'' That's far lower than their adult counterparts. A Quinnipiac University poll of adults also released in April found that 92 percent of blacks approved of the president's handling of his job compared with just 35 percent of whites. (If I were Obama, this would keep me up at night. The next wave of his campaign army may not be so eager to enlist in 2012.)
I say Justin Bieber for president. I know he was born in Canada, but since Republicans want to tinker with the Constitution anyway, why not? Besides, I'm not sure many would notice the difference. Beiber knows how to draw a crowd, get them all excited and then break their hearts. For vice president, maybe they could find a booster seat for Zahara Jolie-Pitt. She probably has about as much message discipline as Joe Biden.
Besides, we need some African-birth-certificate drama for continuity.

HEADLINE: Miffed at Russia, Belarus President Seeks Better Ties With West

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
MINSK, Belarus (Reuters) -- The outspoken president of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, who has long been at odds with the West but lately has been quarreling with Moscow, said Friday that he wanted better ties with the United States and he berated his estranged ally Russia. 
Mr. Lukashenko, criticized in the West over human rights abuses, had once pledged to build a ''union state'' that would combine Belarus with Russia. But his relations with Moscow are now at a new low after Russia cut economic subsidies to Belarus.
''We can, and we would like to, normalize relations with America, and we do not hide this,'' the state media quoted Mr. Lukashenko as saying during a visit to Belarus's central Minsk region.
''We have many themes for negotiations, we have proposals from our side as well as proposals from the American side,'' he said, according to the state media. ''I believe these issues can be resolved.''
The United States and the European Union have criticized Belarus for failing to hold free or fair elections since Mr. Lukashenko came to power in 1994. He was last re-elected in 2006, and he plans to seek another term in the next six months.
Mr. Lukashenko has released prisoners considered by the West to have been political prisoners, and he has taken other steps to appease the European Union and the United States. He accused Russia of putting pressure on him before the next presidential election in Belarus.
''America stays on its position, but Russia has sharply changed its stance, trying to bring the president of Belarus to heel before the well-known political events,'' he said. ''But you have known me for ages -- it is impossible to bend me, and trying to do so is useless.''
Mr. Lukashenko has so far declined to recognize the independence of two pro-Russian breakaway regions in Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which Moscow recognized after a five-day war with Georgia in August 2008.
On Friday, he blamed Moscow for failing to provide incentives to Belarus that would offset any negative consequences for Belarus of recognizing the two separatist regions.
Relations between Russia and Belarus soured further in April when Belarus gave refuge to the former Kyrgyz president, Kurmanbek S. Bakiyev, who was criticized by Moscow. Mr. Bakiyev was ousted after bloody antigovernment riots. Mr. Lukashenko's decision appeared, in particular, to be a swipe at Russia, which had appeared to play at least a partial role in paving the way for Mr. Bakiyev's ouster.
In June, Belarus threatened to cut Russian gas transit to Europe in a pricing dispute.
Mr. Lukashenko also said that Russia could lose a lucrative contract to build the first nuclear power plant in Belarus. ''We are not writing off other investors,'' he said. ''In the near time we will decide who will build our nuclear plant.''
Building a nuclear power plant has been on Belarus's agenda since 2007 after sharp price increases for Russian energy. A third of Belarus was contaminated with radiation when a reactor at Chernobyl in neighboring Ukraine blew up in 1986.

HEADLINE: Fire And Imagination

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The Obama administration seems to be feeling sorry for itself. Robert Gibbs, the president's press secretary, is perturbed that Mr. Obama is not getting more hosannas from liberals.
Spare me. The country is a mess. The economy is horrendous, and millions of American families are running out of ammunition in their fight against destitution. Steadily increasing numbers of middle-class families, who never thought they'd be seeking charity, have been showing up at food pantries.
The war in Afghanistan, with its dreadful human toll and debilitating drain on the nation's financial resources, is proceeding as poorly as ever. As The Times reported on Friday, an ambitious operation that was supposed to showcase the progress of the Afghan Army turned into a tragic, humiliating debacle. 
And while schools are hemorrhaging resources because of budget meltdowns, and teachers are losing jobs, and libraries are finding it more and more difficult to remain open, American youngsters are falling further behind their peers in other developed countries in their graduation rates from colleges and universities.
This would be a good time for the Obama crowd to put aside its concern about the absence of giddiness among liberals and re-examine what it might do to improve what is fast becoming a depressing state of affairs.
It's not just liberals who are gloomy. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll this week found that nearly 6 in 10 Americans believe the country is on the wrong track and a majority disapproves of President Obama's handling of the economy. Nearly two-thirds expect the economy to get worse still.
Mr. Obama's problem -- and the nation's -- is that in the midst of the terrible economic turmoil that the country was in when he took office, he did not make full employment, meaning job creation in both the short and the long term, the nation's absolute highest priority.
Besides responding to the nation's greatest need, job creation would have been the one issue most likely to bolster Mr. Obama's efforts to bring people of different political persuasions together. In the early months of 2009, with job losses soaring past a half-million a month and the country desperate for bold, creative leadership, the president had an opportunity to rally the nation behind an enormous ''rebuild America'' effort.
Such an effort, properly conceived, would have put millions to work overhauling the nation's infrastructure, rebuilding our ports and transportation facilities to 21st-century standards, establishing a Manhattan Project-like quest for a brave new world of clean energy, and so on.
We were going to spend staggering amounts of money in any event. There was every reason to use those enormous amounts of public dollars to leverage private capital, as well, for investment in projects and research that the country desperately needs and that would provide enormous benefits for many decades. Think of the returns the nation reaped from its investments in the interstate highway system, the Land Grant colleges, rural electrification, the Erie and Panama canals, the transcontinental railroad, the technology that led to the Internet, the Apollo program, the G.I. bill.
The problem with the U.S. economy today, as it was during the Great Depression, is the absence of sufficient demand for goods and services. Consumers, struggling with sky-high unemployment and staggering debt loads, are tapped out. The economy cannot be made healthy again, and there is no chance of doing anything substantial about budget deficits, as long as so many millions of people are left with essentially no purchasing power. Jobs are the only real answer.
President Obama missed his opportunity early last year to rally the public behind a call for shared sacrifice and a great national mission to rebuild the United States in a way that would create employment for millions and establish a gleaming new industrial platform for the great advances of the 21st century.
It would have taken fire and imagination, but the public was poised to respond to bold leadership. If the Republicans had balked, and they would have, the president had the option of taking his case to the people, as Truman did in his great underdog campaign of 1948.
During the Depression, Franklin Roosevelt explained to the public the difference between wasteful spending and sound government investments. ''You cannot borrow your way out of debt,'' he said, ''but you can invest your way into a sounder future.''
Now, with so much money already spent and Republicans expected to gain seats in the Congressional elections, the president finds himself with a much weaker hand, even if he were inclined to play it boldly.
What that will mean in the real world of ordinary Americans is that even if there is a fretful recovery from the Great Recession, millions will be left out of it. Hope has morphed into widespread gloom as widespread economic suffering becomes the new normal in America.

HEADLINE: Lawmaker in Ethics Case Lashes Out at Her Accusers

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Representative Maxine Waters went on the offensive Friday, holding an unusual Capitol Hill news conference for nearly 90 minutes to contest ethics charges against her, repeating that any appeals she made to Treasury officials in late 2008 were to get minority banks access to decision makers, not to protect a family investment.
''Neither my staff nor I engaged in any improper behavior,'' said Ms. Waters, a California Democrat, in a sometimes testy exchange with reporters. ''And we did not influence anyone and we did not gain any benefit.'' 
She also presented a PowerPoint review of documents -- essentially a preview of the defense she will offer at her ethics trial. The documents, Ms. Waters argued, proved that any federal assistance provided to OneUnited, the Massachusetts bank her husband still owns stock in, was based on the merits, not any intervention by her office.
''If someone is accused and simply goes into the back room and agrees to some violation even if they are not guilty of it, it would avoid all of the public press, it would be easy on the committee itself,'' she said, referring to the House ethics committee. ''That is how it normally works. But we feel very strongly we cannot do that.''
The committee has filed three charges against Ms. Waters, accusing her office of intervening on behalf of OneUnited at the height of the recession, after it had lost $50 million on an investment it held in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federal housing finance agencies. No date has been set for a trial, and that angers Ms. Waters, who has requested that her case be resolved before the November election.
Ms. Waters acknowledged Friday that she called Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. in early September 2008, just after Fannie and Freddie were taken over by the federal government, creating the $50 million losses for OneUnited, and asked him to arrange a meeting with minority bankers to discuss the crisis.
But she said the request was on behalf of all minority banks -- not just OneUnited, even if most of the bankers that showed up for the meeting were from OneUnited. That frustrated Mr. Paulson, who later called Ms. Waters back to complain. At that meeting, OneUnited executives made an unusual request for a special $50 million bailout, ethics investigators have charged.
Ms. Waters said regardless of how the meeting turned out, her intent was to help minority banks nationwide.
''For the past 34 years I have served in elected office both at the state and national level, and I have made one of my top priorities opening doors and providing access for small, minority and women businesses,'' she said.
Ms. Waters also presented her case that a conversation she had with Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, about OneUnited took place in late September 2008, after her call to Mr. Paulson, rather than in early September, as ethics investigators have suggested. The ethics investigators have reported that Mr. Frank told Ms. Waters during that conversation to stay away from the matter.
Ms. Waters said that she realized she had a conflict and approached Mr. Frank only when OneUnited officials appealed to her for help in getting funds from the bank bailout program, which was first proposed by Mr. Paulson on Sept. 19.
''I realized that if they were asking for money that perhaps I should take a distance from that,'' Ms. Waters told ethics investigators in a transcript of her interview that her office released Friday. ''I told Barney, I can't deal with that.''

HEADLINE: An Unwritten Rule of Political Vacations: Think Domestic

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Forget the lush beaches of Bora Bora or the Campari-soaked cafes along the Cote d'Azur. And don't even think about Rome or Paris. Astute Washington politicians have long known that when it comes to politically palatable summer vacations, it is best not to cross any oceans. Or even seas.
Michelle Obama violated one of this city's most sacrosanct unwritten rules when she went to Spain -- during a recession, no less -- with her daughter and a few friends. Even during good economic times, top government officials tend to stick to the red, white and blue. 
Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to President Obama, is headed to Martha's Vineyard, while another senior adviser, David Axelrod, is going to his family home in the Michigan woods. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates headed Friday to Puget Sound, where he has a house.
And Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton? ''She's here,'' a spokesman in Washington said. ''She was here this week, she'll be here next week. If she does anything she just might hang out in Chappaqua.'' Of course, Mrs. Clinton did just come off the planning and execution of a rather large and expensive event: the wedding of her daughter, Chelsea.
''If top staff leaves the country for vacation, it just opens them up to criticism,'' said Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's press secretary. ''Nantucket is delightful, Minnesota is great, even Florida in August isn't so bad. Just don't cross any international borders.''
A number of top administration officials are heeding that unwritten rule. Besides Ms. Jarrett, another adviser, Pete Rouse, and Denis McDonough, the National Security Council chief of staff, are vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, where the first family will go after a one-night trip to Panama City, Fla., on Saturday that is intended to encourage Americans to visit the oil-struck Gulf States. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner will be close by, one aide said, vacationing on the New England seaside.
As with many other officials, aides balked at giving exact GPS data for Mr. Geithner's holiday locale. Ditto the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, who owns a second home on the Chesapeake Bay. ''That's very closely held,'' one security council staff member said Friday.
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and his wife, Jill, just spent a week in the Hamptons, staying at a friend's house, his aides said, so he kept to the stay-stateside rule. Of course, Mr. Biden may have gotten his international travel itch scratched when he went to the World Cup in South Africa in June, but that does not count as a vacation because, really, he was cheering on Team USA in the match that it tied with England, and that counts as official business.
Likewise, when the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, traveled to Israel with his son in May, he also conducted some business for his boss, using the occasion to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and invite him back to Washington. This month, Mr. Emanuel is expected to go fishing in Montana.
By and large though, everyone is staying close to home. House members are campaigning because they are all up for re-election in November, so do not look for Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, in any international locales. The Senate's Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, will be out campaigning in a bus with fellow Republicans, including Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio.
The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, is headed to the North Carolina coast, detailing his deputy, Bill Burton, to accompany the Obamas to Martha's Vineyard.
Mr. Fleischer, recalling the perils of overseas travel, said he did ''sneak'' out of the country for his honeymoon back in 2002 but kept it quiet. When he left office, he gave himself a dolce vita vacation in Italy, flying to Rome and then driving around Puglia and the heel of the boot. It felt, he said, almost like ''busting out,'' not because he was out of the country, but because he was finally free of the daily stresses of a high-octane White House job.
Fatigue and constant travel is one big reason why so many top officials go low-key for vacation. When you've spent a year putting in 18-hour days and hurtling from one hot spot to the other, ''Do you really want to go to Rome?'' asks Martha Joynt Kumar, a professor at Towson University who studies the presidency. ''I'd just want to go to the beach, put on sunglasses, lie down and sleep.''
But what is it about Americans that we turn up our noses at exotic vacation lifestyles of the governmental rich and famous? Andrea Tantaros, the Daily News columnist who likened Mrs. Obama to Marie Antoinette for going to Spain, said public servants should stay close to home or risk being seen as ''tone deaf'' in these economic times.
The administration's sharp critiques of Wall Street excesses, Ms. Tantaros said, sound hollow ''when the first lady vacations at a five-star resort in Spain.''
But what about members of the Washington media elite, no stranger to nice vacationing? Ms. Tantaros said she draws the line between public servants and private citizens. While she usually goes on vacation in Greece -- her family is Greek -- she will be holidaying this year in an inner tube down the Delaware River, she said.
Of course, even domestic vacationing can sometimes get administration officials into trouble. Remember the ''ski bum?'' That is what newspaper headlines called the counterterrorism chief, Michael E. Leiter, after he spent the days after the failed Christmas Day terrorist attack on the ski slopes with his son. The White House defended Mr. Leiter's six-day trip, but some intelligence officials are still smarting over the drubbing that followed.
This summer, Mr. Leiter ''spent a week -- six days to be precise -- in California and Washington State with his young son visiting a couple of major league ball parks and spending time with his family,'' his spokesman, Carl Kropf, said in an e-mail.

HEADLINE: Blackstone To Pay $4.7 Billion For Dynegy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
The Blackstone Group, the private equity giant, agreed on Friday to buy Dynegy, the Houston power company that once sought to buy Enron, for $4.7 billion including debt, in the largest leveraged buyout so far this year. 
The deal represents a reprieve for stockholders of Dynegy, whose shares have been sliding for several years as the company has struggled with sluggish demand. The shares, which had fallen 74 percent in the last 12 months, soared 63 percent on Friday to close at $4.53.
The weak economy and low natural gas prices have put independent power companies like Dynegy under pressure. In an effort to regain scale and reduce costs, several major deals have been struck in the power industry this year, including the $3.1 billion merger of Mirant and RRI Energy announced in April.
Excluding debt, Blackstone is offering $543 million in cash, or $4.50 for every Dynegy share, a 62 percent premium over the closing price on Thursday.
Blackstone also plans to sell four Dynegy natural gas plants to NRG Energy for $1.36 billion, a sale contingent on the completion of the leveraged buyout.
In acquiring Dynegy, Blackstone is counting on power prices rising from their cyclical lows, positioning the sector for a rebound, according to a person briefed on the matter. Dynegy operates plants that produce more than 12,000 megawatts of power in markets in the Midwest, the Northeast and the West Coast.
The acquisition is the largest leveraged buyout in the world this year, according to Thomson Reuters, topping a $4.6 billion deal in July involving Tomkins, a British engineering company. In the United States, the transaction brings the total volume of buyouts to $42.2 billion, the most since 2007 and up from just $2.7 billion in the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters.
The deal is Blackstone's biggest since the $27 billion takeover of Hilton Hotels in 2007.
Buyout firms have been seeking to put their billions of dollars in untapped investor capital to use. With banks openly seeking out deals to back once again, private equity firms have sought to step up their core business of acquiring and selling companies.
The energy and power industry have been a focus of the private equity industry over the years, most notably in the $44 billion takeover of TXU by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, TPG and Goldman Sachs in 2007. Blackstone was one of four buyout firms to acquire Texas Genco for $1.9 billion 2004, eventually selling the company to NRG for nearly $6 billion a year later.
A decade ago, Dynegy competed with Enron to form a new kind of power player, expanding beyond the traditional business of generating energy into trading and broadband communications. But the company has since stumbled and, stumbling under debt, has been forced to scale back its operations.
''Dynegy's board of directors believes the proposed transaction with Blackstone provides our stockholders with a significant premium over the current stock price and removes the risks to the existing stockholders associated with volatile commodity prices, challenging capital markets and environmental and regulatory uncertainties,'' Bruce A. Williamson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
Under the terms of the deal, Dynegy has a 40-day ''go shop'' period in which it can solicit potentially higher or better bids, though the company cautioned it might not be able to find any.
The deal with Blackstone is expected to close by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Official Sees Chance of a New Boom-and-Bust Cycle

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A lone dissenter on the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee warned Friday that the central bank's monetary strategy could backfire and touch off a new boom-and-bust cycle.
Thomas M. Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, dissented on Tuesday when the Federal Open Market Committee voted 9 to 1 to invest proceeds from the Fed's mortgage-bond portfolio in longer-term Treasury debt. The decision was the Fed's clearest signal yet that its confidence in the pace of the recovery was waning.
''Monetary policy is a useful tool, but it cannot solve every problem faced by the United States,'' Mr. Hoenig told local Chamber of Commerce members in a speech at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. ''In trying to use policy as a cure-all, we will repeat the cycle of severe recession and unemployment in a few short years by keeping rates too low for too long.'' 
Mr. Hoenig added: ''I wish free money was really free and that there was a painless way to move from severe recession and high leverage to robust and sustainable economic growth, but there is no shortcut.''
While Mr. Hoenig's view is far from the mainstream, the timing of his comments -- coming three days after the committee's vote -- signals the difficulties the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will probably face in forging a consensus on monetary policy especially in a climate that Mr. Bernanke has called ''unusually uncertain.''
As president of the Kansas City Fed since 1991, Mr. Hoenig is the longest-serving of the 12 district bank presidents. He is known as an ''inflation hawk,'' meaning that his foremost concern tends to be preventing inflation, the Fed's traditional enemy. Among his allies in that position are several other presidents -- Charles I. Plosser of Philadelphia, Richard W. Fisher of Dallas and Jeffrey M. Lacker of Richmond. None of the three currently vote on the Federal Open Market Committee, where 11 of the 12 Fed presidents share four voting seats through an annual rotation. (The New York Fed president is a permanent member.)
Right now, inflation has been running well below the implicit Fed target of around 2 percent -- so low that a few committee members fear that the economy could instead be at risk of tumbling into deflation. Deflation is a spiral of declining wages and prices, akin to what Japan has experienced since the 1990s.
''In judging how we approach this recovery, it seems to me that we need to be careful not to repeat those policy patterns that followed the recessions of 1990-91 and 2001,'' Mr. Hoenig said. ''If we again leave rates too low, too long, out of our uneasiness over the strength of the recovery and our intense desire to avoid recession at all costs, we are risking a repeat of past errors and the consequences they bring.''
The Fed has kept its benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal funds rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight -- near zero since December 2008. Starting in March 2009, the Fed has stated that the rate is likely to remain ''exceptionally low'' for ''an extended period.''
Voting on the committee, Mr. Hoenig has dissented since January, arguing that the ''extended period'' language had the effect of setting unsafe expectations in the markets.
''To be clear, I am not advocating a tight monetary policy,'' Mr. Hoenig said in his speech on Friday. ''I am advocating a policy that remains accommodative but slowly firms as the economy itself expands and moves toward more balance. I advocate dropping the 'extended period' language from the F.O.M.C.'s statement and removing its guarantee of low rates. This tells the market that it must again accept risks and lend if it wishes to earn a return.''
Peter N. Ireland, a professor at Boston College and a former economist at the Richmond Fed, said he was unconvinced. ''While there are risks, certainly, of higher inflation down the road, I agree with the consensus that deflation is much more of a concern,'' he said. ''The policy he is calling for is quite off the mark.''
Professor Ireland said he feared that Mr. Hoenig's comments might inadvertently complicate efforts by Mr. Bernanke and other officials to present a unified message. ''There's a tremendous amount of confusion right now, amongst the public and in the financial markets, as to what the Fed is seeing vis-a-vis the economy right now,'' he said. ''This is not to say that dissent is not allowed, but just to say that the way the dissent is being presented to the public seems highly counterproductive right now.''

HEADLINE: Buyer, Be Aware

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is an economics columnist for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
During the great housing bubble and bust, journalists spent a fair amount of time searching for the perfect mortgage victim. This victim would be someone who played by the rules, took a conservative approach to his finances and simply wanted a decent place to live. He made his monthly payments on time, right up to the day that the bank informed him that his payments would balloon because of a fine-print technicality that no borrower could have understood. Just like that, the homeowner was facing foreclosure.
By and large, these searches failed. The stories of the housing bust tended to be more complicated. Many borrowers stretched to buy homes, figuring that they would be making more money soon enough or that housing prices would keep going up. In Southern California, one homeowner told me he was well aware that his monthly payments would eventually balloon. He thought everything would work out, though, because he assumed that ever-rising home values would allow him to refinance. Much of the country shared this belief. 
Banks, mortgage brokers and real-estate agents were only too happy to encourage these fantasies, of course. In many cases, their encouragement crossed the line into malfeasance. But the bubble grew as large as it did because this malfeasance fed on human frailty, naivete and even irresponsibility.
This summer, with the bubble long gone, Congress and the Obama administration enacted a sweeping new law meant to change the business of lending and borrowing money. The part of the law that will directly affect the most people will be the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has already been the subject of heated debate. And the central question facing the bureau will be how to distinguish between corporate malfeasance and consumer frailty.
It is not an easy task. For as long as there has been money, people have been doing stupid things with it. We borrow more than we can afford. We pay higher interest rates than we need to. We play the lottery. The new consumer bureau can prohibit some of the banks' worst practices. But figuring out precisely where to draw the line will be much more nuanced than the past year's black-and-white, left-and-right debate over whether an agency should exist at all.
Elizabeth Warren -- the Harvard law professor who first proposed such an agency, in a 2007 article in the journal Democracy -- has pointed out that the history of consumer financial protection is a history of ''thou shalt not.'' The government bans lenders from doing something, and the banks stop. Quickly, however, they come up with new ways to separate people from their money. Last year's credit-card legislation, for example, cracked down on overdraft fees (the frequently steep charges for people who tried to withdraw more money on a debit card than they had in their account). Banks have responded by raising other fees.
This is why the thou-shalt-not approach, Warren says, ''means you'll always be behind.'' Or, as Richard Thaler, the University of Chicago behavioral economist, puts it, ''Regulating what financial companies can and cannot charge for is a losing game, because they'll always think of something else.''
Their agreement on this point is notable, because Warren has come to represent the muscularly progressive vision of the new bureau, while behavioral economists like Thaler (who is close to several Obama advisers) are seen as more technocratic. And there is no doubt that the bureau will need to make judgment calls that some regulators would make differently than others. But the basic vision for the bureau is not in dispute, at least not among the people who are likely to run it under Obama.
The overriding goal of the bureau will be to help people understand their financial choices. More often than not, it will allow banks to continue a given practice -- but force them to explain, in clear terms, what it means for consumers. Earlier this summer, I refinanced my mortgage and was reminded yet again of how much modern finance depends on obfuscation. Nowhere in the pile of documents was there a simple explanation of the only information that mattered to me: how much the bank was charging in fees, how much the lawyer was charging, how much the government was charging and how much my monthly payment would fall. Instead, I was confronted with a blizzard of terms that I did not fully understand: origination, title services, release tracking and the like.
Done right, the new bureau can begin to change this. It can require banks to speak in the language of customers, not internal bureaucracy. Another part of last year's credit-card legislation offered a preview. As of February, banks have had to give people the often-bracing calculation of how much it will cost them to pay off their balance if they make only the minimum monthly payment, as well as how many years it will take. To see if such steps are working -- and to keep pace with Wall Street ingenuity -- the new bureau will have a research budget allowing it to test whether consumers truly know what they're signing up for.
The ultimate goal is pushing banks to compete in ways that benefit consumers, rather than having them compete over which methods can most cleverly fool consumers. If people know the true costs of their mortgages, credit cards, debit cards and mutual funds, they are more likely to gravitate to those offering low costs and good benefits. This will have the added feature of reducing the enormous, historically abnormal profits that Wall Street has enjoyed in recent years. It is also the way a market is supposed to work.
Still, no matter how well we grasp the implications of fees and interest on our credit cards, we may still decide to use a card to buy a new television or kitchen we can't really afford. The new consumer bureau will not try to stop us. And it almost certainly will not be enough to prevent another bubble, in some other realm, sometime in the future.
But that is probably not a realistic goal anyway. Prohibition, after all, has a decidedly mixed record. A better goal may simply be making sure we understand what we are doing and hoping that is enough to make us a little less frail.

HEADLINE: A City That Knows Long Odds

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
ATLANTIC CITY
A DECADE into the century, New Jersey got a new governor who vowed to cure what ailed this place. The story has a familiar ring today, but that governor was Woodrow Wilson, and the year was 1910.
A long line of public figures have tried to ''fix'' Atlantic City, including reformers who have attacked the corruption that was baked deeply into local politics, but most of them, including Wilson, had little lasting impact. Their experience is a cautionary tale for the latest in that line, Gov. Chris Christie, who announced plans last month to revive this city's flagging economy by having the state essentially take over municipal operations in the casino district.
For generations, politicians tried to combat vice; for the last four decades, they have promoted it. Either way, Atlantic City's fortunes have risen and fallen mostly on two factors: how easy it made access to gambling, liquor and sex -- or some combination of the three -- and how hard they were to get elsewhere.
The city's heyday came during Prohibition, when alcohol, gambling parlors and brothels flourished openly, protected by a powerful political boss, Nucky Johnson. 
''There was a social compact between people who understood the law had to be violated or ignored for the city to succeed,'' said Nelson C. Johnson, the author of a history, ''Boardwalk Empire,'' that inspired a coming HBO miniseries of the same name. ''The government, the resort industry and the rackets were closely tied, and they had a joint vision for the town.''
Atlantic City's population peaked at more than 66,000 in 1930, slipped below 60,000 in 1960, and by 1980 plunged to about 40,000, where it remains. The introduction of casino gambling in 1978 sparked a revival of the economy, but the city has been pummeled since 2006 by the explosion of legalized gambling nearby, in Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York and Maryland.
Now, residents, politicians, business owners and financial analysts are asking whether Atlantic City is at another turning point -- or at death's door. Can it hold on to the resort market share it has, or even regain some of what it has lost? Can it recover by adopting a new identity and a new appeal? Or is it fated to endure another long, steady slide?
Gambling profits at the city's 11 casinos are down almost 30 percent since 2006 (nearly double the rate of decline in Las Vegas); the casinos have shed 12,000 jobs in recent years.
The signs of trouble were obvious on a midsummer visit, during what should be the peak season. The famed Boardwalk was not crowded, there was no wait for tables at popular restaurants, tickets were still available days before a Black Eyed Peas concert, and rows of slot machines sat unused, blinking away at no one. Prime real estate parcels lie vacant on the Boardwalk, where projects like the Pinnacle casino never came to pass and construction stopped recently on the Revel, which was supposed to become the city's largest casino hotel but is now looking for a new owner.
It is a far cry from the city that first blossomed in the 19th century as a cheap beach getaway with easy railroad access from Philadelphia.
Atlantic City became a place for visitors to cut loose in a gaudy, carnival atmosphere where prostitution and illegal gambling flourished. Serving alcohol on Sunday, in open violation of state law, was a pillar of the economy. In 1908, Gov. John Franklin Fort called the city a ''Saturnalia of vice.''
A few years later, Wilson's administration managed to send Louis Kuehnle, the boss of Atlantic City, to prison, but that barely made a dent. Instead, it cleared the way for Enoch L. Johnson to take over and become the most powerful ruler the city has had. Johnson, known as Nucky, became close to the mobster Lucky Luciano, and in 1929 he welcomed to Atlantic City the first national meeting of organized crime leaders, including Al Capone.
The political machine, nominally Republican, ran the town with corruption so thorough as to make other cities' political bosses blush. Every bid was rigged, every contractor paid kickbacks, every public employee had to pay the machine, and the police, prosecutors and judges were in on it.
Routine vote fraud produced turnouts big enough to make little Atlantic City a force in statewide politics. Reform movements out of Trenton stopped at the bridge to Absecon Island.
''It was corrupt, but people didn't care, because it worked,'' said Mr. Johnson, the historian, who is also an Atlantic County judge and no relation to Nucky. ''The system took care of people's needs, and the money came from out-of-towners.''
But even at the city's peak, poverty was pervasive, particularly on Atlantic City's mostly black north side. An economy dependent on summer crowds offered mostly seasonal jobs, leaving workers struggling the rest of the year.
After years spent digging into Atlantic City, the Federal Bureau of Investigation shut down brothels in the late 1930s and finally nailed Nucky Johnson, who went to prison in 1941 for tax evasion.
By then, the city was already in decline -- the end of Prohibition had taken away its advantage, and the Depression had left fewer people with money to burn. During World War II, the military insisted that the illegal gambling rooms be shut down so that servicemen stationed in the city would not be fleeced. The proliferation of cars after the war gave people access to many more resort locales.
But if the crowds faded, corruption did not. The political machine that exercised lock-step control of the city remained long after Nucky Johnson, even as there were fewer spoils to divide.
City leaders attracted the Democratic National Convention in 1964 -- a precursor to the current calls to reinvent the casino district as a convention magnet -- but that backfired. Reporters from around the country portrayed a city in decay, and delegates complained about an infrastructure so frayed that it could not meet basic demands like phone service and air-conditioning.
A 1972 shootout in an Atlantic City nightclub between rival Philadelphia drug gangs killed four people, wounded many more and cemented the city's image as a dangerous place. The perception of crime, as much as the reality of it, remains a major problem.
But the 1970s also brought the one movement to cure Atlantic City that had a notable effect: the campaign to legalize casinos, approved by New Jersey voters in 1976. The first casino, Resorts International, opened two years later, to success beyond any predictions. The casinos gave the city a year-round economy for the first time, a building boom brought construction jobs, and gambling taxes became a reliable revenue source for the city, the county and the state.
''Everyone understood that it was the one thing that could bring the city back,'' said Mayor Lorenzo T. Langford, who has worked as a dealer and pit boss in casinos.
But the expected population rebound never materialized, and the vast majority of casino workers live outside the city. Twenty-six percent of Atlantic City residents lived in poverty in 2008, double the national rate. The city's north side is riddled with empty lots where dilapidated houses have been torn down; there are ample vacancies in pricier parts of town, too, where developers and real estate speculators mistimed the market.
One critical decision that has been second-guessed was allowing casinos -- including the newest and most profitable, the Borgata -- in the marina district, which drew patrons and revenue away from the historic tourist core along the Boardwalk.
The old political machine was replaced by a kind of freelance corruption, with constant jockeying for advantage among rival factions, frequent turnover, and no one really in charge. In the last 40 years, there have been criminal convictions of five mayors and countless other officials.
(Mayor Langford has his own peculiar situation. His allies helped arrange for an $850,000 settlement in 2002 to a lawsuit he and a City Council colleague had filed against the city before he became mayor. The courts ruled that the settlement was poisoned by conflicts of interest and ordered the money returned, leaving Mr. Langford among the debtors to his own impoverished city, making piecemeal payments.)
Meanwhile, as gambling continues to expand in neighboring states -- Pennsylvania and Delaware both recently added table games to their slot-machine parlors -- Atlantic City casino operators and local and state officials have not reached a consensus on how to change the city's appeal.
''What's fascinating to me is this town's always been able to sell itself, to sell something beyond its true worth,'' Nelson Johnson said. ''I've seen it all my life, and maybe we'll see it again.''

TELL US WE'RE HOME
By Marina Budhos
297 pp. Atheneum Books for Young Readers. $16.99. (Ages 12 and up)
From ''Jane Eyre'' to ''The Nanny Diaries,'' literature is rich with stories about the domestic lives of the privileged, as observed by their domestics. Marina Budhos offers a further twist in her novel ''Tell Us We're Home'': Now the children of the privileged are observed by the sharp-eyed daughters of their nannies and housekeepers, as they mingle in the school hallways of an affluent New Jersey suburb. 
Budhos's eighth-grade heroines are Jaya from Trinidad, shy and artistic, who lives with her widowed mother, a housecleaner and baby sitter; timid Maria, recently arrived from Mexico, who translates for her mother during interviews for office-cleaning jobs; and Lola from Slovakia, bright and contentious, whose mother is a housekeeper for the family of a boy in her grade.
Outsiders and best friends, the three girls gaze over an invisible fence defined by their poverty and foreignness. ''It was just weird,'' Budhos writes, gracefully inhabiting the girls' point of view. ''You knew your mother put extra bleach in the underwear of some girl who was walking up the aisle at assembly. . . . Or those shoes you wore were hand-me-downs from the kid in the grade above you.'' The girls dread Monday mornings, when their classmates come to school wearing the trophy sweatshirts from the weekend bar and bat mitzvahs, to which these three are never invited.
''Tell Us We're Home'' sometimes wobbles under the weight of Budhos's ambitions. In striving to capture adolescent longing, the disorientation of immigrants and class tensions, she gives her characters a journey of self-discovery overstuffed with drama. Jaya's mother is accused of stealing from an elderly employer. Maria develops a crush on a wealthy high school boy, her hopes inflated by his support of a maligned Latino soccer team. Lola, who simmers with resentment -- at her father, paralyzed by depression and unemployment, and at her alpha girl archnemesis -- nearly burns her own friendships and her future, too.
Yet for all the emotional and physical violence that shadows the girls, Budhos tells their story with a warmth that is ultimately sweet and rewarding. They study fashion trends and then rummage through discount stores in Union City and Newark for knockoff accessories. They exchange the cover stories they use to explain away their mothers' menial jobs. In a memorable scene, they try on dresses at Bergdorf's, just the way their classmates would, minus the platinum credit cards.
Offering a fresh perspective on suburban American life, ''Tell Us We're Home'' seems ready-made for an appendix with a readers' discussion guide. Although the novel has its touch-all-bases predictable qualities, it is elevated by writing that is intelligent and earnestly passionate.

CYBER WAR The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It. By Richard A. Clarke and Robert K. Knake. Ecco/HarperCollins, $25.99. Clarke, who caused a sensation by blasting the Bush administration for failing to heed his warnings when he was counterterrorism czar before 9/11, identifies with the prophet Cassandra. But his own doomsaying takes a bureaucratic form: demands for budgetary and political resources. 
In his 2004 best seller, ''Against All Enemies,'' he demonstrated a gift for dramatic narrative. Now a consultant and academic, he has turned his attention to a new worry, and in ''Cyber War,'' written with Robert K. Knake of the Council on Foreign Relations, he succeeds in rousing fear. Computer sabotage has already begun to figure prominently in military encounters, the authors say. During the 2008 war between Georgia and Russia, Georgia's Internet connections were jammed; Clarke and Knake also believe that Israel disabled Syria's air defenses during its 2007 bombing of a suspected nuclear site. These attacks only hint at the potential of cyberwar, which ''could devastate a modern nation,'' the authors write. In a cyberwar with a restrictive society like China, they say, America would be disadvantaged by the very asset that has empowered its digital economy: an advanced information-technology infrastructure. The authors' priority is to ensure the security of three essential networks: the backbone of the Internet; the electric grid; and the Pentagon's systems. But since two powerful interest groups -- defenders of the Internet's open architecture and opponents of government regulation -- stand in the way of their agenda, this latest prophecy, despite its merits, may well be disregarded too.
THE IRONY OF MANIFEST DESTINY The Tragedy of America's Foreign Policy. By William Pfaff. Walker, $25. Modern history's most destructive upheavals, from the French Revolution to Stalinism, Pfaff says, were incited by a ''secular utopianism'' that the Enlightenment substituted for religious beliefs. He argues that a variant of this malignant fantasy has now overtaken the American foreign policy establishment. Pfaff, a former columnist for The International Herald Tribune, writes that America has increasingly committed itself to a hyper-Wilsonian view, embodied in its assertions, without evidence, that a steady development of international ''cooperative institutions'' under American leadership is improving ''the moral (and political) nature of humans.'' To Pfaff, only this national myth can fully explain the war on terror, which he calls a ''parody of the cold war,'' fought against ''a few thousand Muslim mujahedeen.'' A threat that ''good police work'' could have contained, he suggests, was instead built up to justify a militarized intensification of the ''universal democracy'' project. Pfaff's call for a ''noninterventionist alternative'' should not be dismissed lightly. But by treating his opponents' views as fundamentally deluded, he fails to do them justice. There are reasons other than imperial hubris to question Pfaff's suggestion of an equivalence between aggressive democracy promotion and Nazi and Soviet aggrandizement.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES His Own Words, Selected and Arranged by Daniel Ruddy. Smithsonian/HarperCollins, $27.99. ''I claim to be a historian,'' Theodore Roosevelt said, and it was not the idle boast of a politician moonlighting on a vanity project. Confidently in command of his subject matter, Roosevelt is a lucid and bracingly opinionated writer -- he calls Jefferson ''perhaps the most incapable executive that ever filled the presidential chair.'' Edmund Morris, who provides a foreword to this book, wrote in his biography that Roosevelt's ''Naval War of 1812'' and ''Winning of the West'' ''are considered definitive by serious historians.'' The concept behind this book, edited by Ruddy, a marketing consultant and Roosevelt aficionado, sounds promising. Ruddy has arranged quotations from Roosevelt's books, letters and speeches chronologically by theme (George Washington, the Civil War, and so forth) to create ''Theodore Roosevelt's History of the United States.'' The resulting text is repetitive and lacks narrative or analytical momentum; it feels like a series of disjointed quotations (source notes at the back of the book indicate how the selections were stitched together). Nonetheless, the format is useful for showing how Roosevelt consciously grounded his assertive nationalism in a political tradition stretching from Hamilton through Lincoln. Roosevelt's bedrock principle was that democratic liberty is best served, counterintuitively, by a strong government. States' rights ''doctrinaires'' like Jefferson, ''who are fiercest in declaiming in favor of freedom, are in reality its worst foes,'' he writes, since ''license'' eventually degenerates into ''one-man power.''
NOT FOR PROFIT Why Democracy Needs the Humanities. By Martha C. Nussbaum. Princeton University, $22.95. The trend in education at all levels and around the world, Nussbaum fears, is toward rote instruction in ''applied skills suited to profit-making'' and away from cultivation of ''the ability to think critically'' and ''to imagine sympathetically the predicament of another person.'' Nussbaum, a professor at the University of Chicago, brings to this perennial debate an impassioned urgency (''The future of the world's democracies hangs in the balance'') and broad erudition. She draws on developmental psychology to present a model for teaching children how ''narcissism, helplessness, shame'' and ''disgust'' interfere with compassion. Surveying Socrates, Rousseau, Dewey, Rabindranath Tagore and others, she investigates the key insight of progressive pedagogy through the ages, that ''student passivity'' is not ''good for citizenship or for life.'' Nussbaum's defense of this worthy cause is deeply learned, but she only glancingly engages with the arguments for standardized testing of basic skills, a considerable lapse in a work dedicated to promoting understanding of the Other. She sets up straw-man antagonists, unidentified diabolical educators who would foster ''moral obtuseness'' to make students into better capitalist automatons. And Nussbaum never wrestles with the conflict between her goals of nurturing open debate and instilling a ''normative'' value system, nor with the complications of teaching values in a polarized political environment. Conservatives would undoubtedly fight Nussbaum over which norms to instill.

HEADLINE: Free Parking Comes at a Price

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
IN our society, cars receive considerable attention and study -- whether the subject is buying and selling them, the traffic congestion they cause or the dangerous things we do in them, like texting and talking on cellphones while driving. But we haven't devoted nearly enough thought to how cars are usually deployed -- namely, by sitting in parking spaces.
Is this a serious economic issue? In fact, it's a classic tale of how subsidies, use restrictions, and price controls can steer an economy in wrong directions. Car owners may not want to hear this, but we have way too much free parking. 
Higher charges for parking spaces would limit our trips by car. That would cut emissions, alleviate congestion and, as a side effect, improve land use. Donald C. Shoup, professor of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles, has made this idea a cause, as presented in his 733-page book, ''The High Cost of Free Parking.''
Many suburbanites take free parking for granted, whether it's in the lot of a big-box store or at home in the driveway. Yet the presence of so many parking spaces is an artifact of regulation and serves as a powerful subsidy to cars and car trips. Legally mandated parking lowers the market price of parking spaces, often to zero. Zoning and development restrictions often require a large number of parking spaces attached to a store or a smaller number of spaces attached to a house or apartment block.
If developers were allowed to face directly the high land costs of providing so much parking, the number of spaces would be a result of a careful economic calculation rather than a matter of satisfying a legal requirement. Parking would be scarcer, and more likely to have a price -- or a higher one than it does now -- and people would be more careful about when and where they drove.
The subsidies are largely invisible to drivers who park their cars -- and thus free or cheap parking spaces feel like natural outcomes of the market, or perhaps even an entitlement. Yet the law is allocating this land rather than letting market prices adjudicate whether we need more parking, and whether that parking should be free. We end up overusing land for cars -- and overusing cars too. You don't have to hate sprawl, or automobiles, to want to stop subsidizing that way of life.
As Professor Shoup wrote, ''Minimum parking requirements act like a fertility drug for cars.''
Under a more sensible policy, a parking space that is currently free could cost at least $100 a month -- and maybe much more -- in many American cities and suburbs. At the bottom end of that estimate, if a commuter drives to work 20 days a month, current parking policy offers a subsidy of $5 a day -- which is more than the gas and wear-and-tear costs of many round-trip commutes. In essence, the parking subsidy outweighs many of the other costs of driving, including the gasoline tax.
In densely populated cities like New York, people are accustomed to paying high prices for parking, which has helped to encourage a relatively efficient, high-density use of space. Yet even New York is reluctant to enact the full social cost of the automobile into policy. Proposals to impose congestion fees have failed politically, and on-street parking is priced artificially low.
Manhattan streets are full of cars cruising around, looking for cheaper on-street parking, rather than pulling into a lot. The waste includes drivers' lost time and the costs of running those engines. By contrast, San Francisco has just instituted a pioneering program to connect parking meter prices to supply and demand, with prices being adjusted, over time, within a general range of 25 cents to $6 an hour.
Another common practice in many cities is to restrict on-street parking to residents or to short-term parkers by imposing a limit of, say, two hours for transients. That makes parking artificially easy for residents and for people who are running quick errands. Higher fees and permit prices would help shore up the ailing budgets of local governments.
Many parking spaces are extremely valuable, even if that's not reflected in current market prices. In fact, Professor Shoup estimates that many American parking spaces have a higher economic value than the cars sitting in them. For instance, after including construction and land costs, he measures the value of a Los Angeles parking space at over $31,000 -- much more than the worth of many cars, especially when considering their rapid depreciation. If we don't give away cars, why give away parking spaces?
Yet 99 percent of all automobile trips in the United States end in a free parking space, rather than a parking space with a market price. In his book, Professor Shoup estimated that the value of the free-parking subsidy to cars was at least $127 billion in 2002, and possibly much more.
PERHAPS most important, if we're going to wean ourselves away from excess use of fossil fuels, we need to remove current subsidies to energy-unfriendly ways of life. Imposing a cap-and-trade system or a direct carbon tax doesn't seem politically acceptable right now. But we can start on alternative paths that may take us far.
Imposing higher fees for parking may make further changes more palatable by helping to promote higher residential density and support for mass transit.
As Professor Shoup puts it: ''Who pays for free parking? Everyone but the motorist.''

HEADLINE: Smaller, Quieter and Gaining New Respect

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
AS automotive earth saviors go, electric cars and hybrids are widely presumed to be the chosen ones.
But as carmakers and consumers seek real, affordable gains in miles per gallon, it will be the once-humble 4-cylinder combustion engine that takes them there -- far more than electrics or hybrids, which are years away from selling in numbers that would rein in the nation's greenhouse emissions and appetite for oil.
The new allure of 4-cylinder engines certainly defies the odds. From the '70s through the '90s, as Japan rode small cars to world-changing success, Detroit's compacts were poor ambassadors for the 4-cylinder. American economy cars like the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Escort limped along with base-level 4s that were often rackety, unreliable and weak-kneed. When trucks, particularly brutish S.U.V.'s, became King of the Hill in the new millennium, buyers reflexively chose a V-6 or a thirsty V-8. 
Today, though, American buyers shifting to smaller cars and lighter crossovers are discovering downsized engines strong enough to meet their needs. So far this year, 47 percent of new vehicles have 4 cylinders under the hood, according to J. D. Power & Associates, a remarkable jump from 30 percent in 2005. Over that time, the market share of burly V-8s has fallen to 16 percent, from 26 percent.
Family sedans, long a litmus test for the American family, show more consumers skipping an optional 6-cylinder for a fuel-efficient 4. Through July, 93 percent of Nissan Altima buyers chose the 4-cylinder version, up from 85 percent in 2007, just before fuel prices soared and the car market tanked. The 4-cylinder version of the Ford Fusion, which attracted 55 percent of buyers in 2007, now accounts for over 70 percent of sales.
Those buyers are finding engines much more refined than the 4s of their parents' generation -- still stingy on gas, but surprisingly smooth and powerful. So much so that the modern engines, girded with power-aiding technologies like turbochargers and direct injection, can beat many V-6s in both horsepower and fuel economy. And the likelihood that Formula One cars, the epitome of racing technology, will soon switch to 4-cylinder engines might convince even a jaded small-engine skeptic.
Civilizing the 4-cylinder engine, a popular power source for vehicles in the United States dating back to the Model T, once posed a huge challenge. While in-line 4s can be elegantly simple, the up-and-down motion of their pistons produces an annoying -- and unavoidable -- imbalance that grows with engine size.
Modern 4-cylinders provide relief from the buzzing through the use of technologies that can quell the inherent noise and harshness, including counterbalance shafts, sophisticated combustion controls and improved sound deadening and engine mounts.
An alternate plan, used by Subaru today (and Volkswagen in earlier times), is to design engines that don't generate the jitters in the first place. Boxer engines, whose four cylinders are laid flat in 180-degree opposition, naturally cancel out most vibration, without a need for balance shafts.
But while boxer 4s (or even the V-4 engines used in many motorcycles) offer advantages in smoothness, automakers say that their modern in-line 4s are smooth enough to satisfy even the fussiest customers.
Still, for consumers like Jennifer and Jarid Lukin of Ardsley, N.Y., saving fuel and money remains the biggest lure. The recently traded their 6-cylinder Acura TL for a new Honda Accord EX-L and its 190-horsepower 4. The Accord is rated at 25 m.p.g. in combined city and highway driving by the E.P.A., compared with 21 for the Acura.
''With our lifestyle, we didn't need a 6-cylinder,'' Ms. Lukin said. ''The 4-cylinder isn't a racecar, but I'm not racing to day care.''
Hybrids, Ms. Lukin said, might post even better mileage, but also cost thousands of dollars extra upfront. ''We're saving money right now, and in the long term,'' she said.
Those kind of consumer calculations spurred Hyundai to draw up what seemed a bold strategy only a year ago: to build its 2011 Sonata family sedan with only 4-cylinder engines, no optional V-6. Now that choice seems prescient.
The midsize Sonata is selling well with a 2.4-liter, direct-injection 4 that is the strongest and most frugal in its class: 200 horsepower with 35 highway m.p.g. Compare that with 1990, when the Sonata's 4 produced a puny 116 horsepower and just 25 highway m.p.g.
''These are good times,'' said John Krafcik, chief executive of Hyundai Motor America. ''Americans aren't counting cylinders any more.''
This fall, the Sonata will offer a turbocharged 4 that combines 274 horsepower with a highway rating of 34 m.p.g. A Sonata Hybrid will harness an electric motor, lithium-polymer batteries and, yes, a gas 4-cylinder, to return roughly 38 m.p.g.
General Motors' Buick division has matched Hyundai's strategy with its 2011 Regal sedan. A version of the stylish Opel Insignia sold in Europe -- where even big autobahn sedans rely on smaller gasoline or diesel engines -- the midsize Regal offers a choice of a 182-horsepower 4-cylinder or a 220-horsepower turbo version.
Smaller engines also trim vehicle weight and development costs, and not simply because they are lighter or have fewer parts. Engineers, Mr. Krafcik said, did not have to spend time designing a stronger chassis for the Sonata to support a V-6 version.
''If you have a V-6 in the lineup, it makes the 4-cylinder version heavier than it needs to be,'' Mr. Krafcik said.
Let's not overlook the green elephant in the room; this trend is not driven entirely by consumer demand or environmental consciousness on the part of automakers. Around the world, downsized engines are the linchpin of strategies to meet stricter fuel-economy and pollution rules, including limits on carbon-dioxide emissions.
In the United States, the regulatory bar calls for new cars and trucks to average at least 34.1 m.p.g. by 2016, a level that would result in emissions of 250 grams of carbon dioxide per mile driven. That carbon cutoff is itself momentous: cars will need to improve mileage to about 37.8 m.p.g., up from the current 27.5 m.p.g., with trucks rising to 28.8 m.p.g. from 23.5 today.
Even at companies like Ford, which has ambitious plans for electric vehicles, leaders say that downsizing engines in mainstream products will save vastly more fuel than will hybrids, diesels or electrics -- and at much lower cost to consumers.
Ford has pledged to put 1.3 million of its EcoBoost engines on the road by 2013 -- two-thirds of them 4-cylinder versions -- and to offer them in 80 percent of its model lineup. Brett Hinds, Ford's manager of advanced engine design, called EcoBoost ''the cornerstone of our sustainability efforts.''
''A hybrid can have a big impact per vehicle, but the numbers sold are relatively small,'' Mr. Hinds said. ''EcoBoost engines can have a large-scale impact on global carbon dioxide, fuel consumption and oil imports.''
Of course, if gasoline stays relatively affordable, Americans may resist the small-engine gospel and backslide into big V-8s. But Mike Omotoso, powertrain forecaster for J. D. Power, said more consumers were resigning themselves to a world of higher-price gas and choosing their cars accordingly.
Ford is placing a big industry bet with the redesigned Explorer, looking to restore sales and shine to what was once America's top-selling S.U.V. The 2011 model will offer an optional turbocharged 2-liter EcoBoost with 4 cylinders, a count that might have seemed laughable in the Explorer's heyday.
Yet that pint-size engine produces a surprising 237 horsepower and 250 pound-feet of torque -- just 5 pound-feet less than the 3.5-liter V-6 alternative, with the tradeoff that it makes 53 fewer horses. It's also expected to deliver about 19/27 m.p.g. in city and highway driving, according to Ford, a 30 percent improvement from the previous Explorer's V-8.
Relying on the architecture of the Ford Taurus, the new Explorer -- now a car-based crossover -- shaves several hundred pounds from the old pickup-based version, making a small engine more suitable. That engine alone trims nearly 100 pounds, and as with the Sonata, weight savings snowballed through the design. While the pricing isn't official, Ford has said it will charge more for the EcoBoost model than for the V-6 version. Some customers, Mr. Hinds acknowledges, may resist paying extra for an engine with fewer cylinders. Yet test-driving the EcoBoost Explorer, he said, would bring skeptics into the growing 4-cylinder fold -- and have them convincing friends that bigger isn't always better:
''I drove the 2-liter Explorer, and it was great,'' is what Mr. Hinds hopes they will be saying.

HEADLINE: Academic Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By MARK C. TAYLOR. 
Mark C. Taylor, the chairman of the religion department at Columbia University, is the author of the forthcoming ''Crisis on Campus: A Bold Plan for Reforming Our Colleges and Universities.''

 BODY:
WITH the academic year about to begin, colleges and universities, as well as students and their parents, are facing an unprecedented financial crisis. What we've seen with California's distinguished state university system -- huge cutbacks in spending and a 32 percent rise in tuition -- is likely to become the norm at public and private colleges. Government support is being slashed, endowments and charitable giving are down, debts are piling up, expenses are rising and some schools are selling their product for two-thirds of what it costs to produce it. You don't need an M.B.A. to know this situation is unsustainable.
With unemployment soaring, higher education has never been more important to society or more widely desired. But the collapse of our public education system and the skyrocketing cost of private education threaten to make college unaffordable for millions of young people. If recent trends continue, four years at a top-tier school will cost $330,000 in 2020, $525,000 in 2028 and $785,000 in 2035. 
Yet most faculty and administrators refuse to acknowledge this crisis. Consider what is taking place here in New York City. Rather than learning to live within their means, Columbia University, where I teach, and New York University are engaged in a fierce competition to expand as widely and quickly as possible. Last spring, N.Y.U. announced plans to increase its physical plant by 40 percent over the next 20 years; this summer Columbia secured approval for its $6.3 billion expansion in Upper Manhattan. N.Y.U. is also opening a new campus in Abu Dhabi this fall.
The financial arrangements for these projects remain obscure, but it is clear that they will not be completed without increasing the universities' already significant and perhaps unsustainable levels of debt. Last year Columbia reported $1.4 billion in outstanding debt against a $5.89 billion endowment. N.Y.U. had a staggering $2.22 billion debt with a relatively modest $2.2 billion endowment -- one that had shrunk by more than 11 percent over the previous fiscal year. For universities, as for banks, the question is not only the value of current and projected assets but also the availability of liquidity so they can pay off interim debt obligations during a time of financial instability.
There is a similarity between the debt crisis on Wall Street and what threatens higher education. Just as investors borrowed more and increased their leverage in volatile markets, many colleges and universities are borrowing more and betting on an expanding market in higher education at the precise moment their product is becoming affordable for fewer people.
Financial aid is drying up and government support is not keeping pace with the rising cost of college, so students and parents are being forced to borrow more heavily. For decades, admissions offices have marketed themselves by promising a significant return on the investment in the form of higher lifetime income. But with the cost of an undergraduate degree well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, this argument is no longer persuasive. Students and their parents are carrying unsustainable levels of debt, which is likely to lead to a crisis that will mirror the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. To make matters worse, student debt is even more toxic than a soured mortgage, because it is nearly impossible for a person to legally walk away from student loans the way a homeowner can walk away from a mortgage.
The competition between Columbia and N.Y.U. is an example of what educational institutions should not be doing. Universities should be looking for new ways to provide high-quality education to more students at a lower price. In today's world, it no longer makes sense for every school to cover every subject.
For example, it is absurd for Columbia and N.Y.U. to be have competing philosophy departments at a time when there are few jobs for philosophy academics. Instead, they could cooperate by forming a joint graduate and undergraduate program, which would reduce costs by requiring fewer faculty members and a more modest physical presence, while at the same time increasing course choices for students. And in our wired world, universities on opposite sides of the globe could find similar ways to collaborate.
American higher education has long been the envy of the world, but today our institutions are eroding from within and are facing growing competition from countries like China and India, which are developing ambitious plans to enter the global higher education market. Capital can be intellectual and cultural as well as financial; it is vital that American higher education remains the reserve currency of the global educational system. No less than Wall Street, our colleges and universities are in dire need of reform.

HEADLINE: Angels in America

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
TO appreciate how much and how unexpectedly our country can change, look no further than the life and times of Judith Dunnington Peabody, who died on July 25 at 80 in her apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York.
The proper names in her biographical sketch suggest a stereotype from a bygone New Yorker cartoon: Miss Hewitt's Classes, the Ethel Walker School, Bryn Mawr, the Junior League. She ''was introduced to society,'' as they said of debutantes back then, at the Piping Rock Club, Locust Valley, N.Y., in 1947. As the fashionable wife of Samuel P. Peabody in the decades to follow, she shared the society pages with Pat Buckley, Babe Paley and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But to quote Tracy Lord, the socialite played by Katharine Hepburn in the classic high-society movie comedy ''The Philadelphia Story,'' ''The time to make up your mind about people is never.'' In 1985, Judith Peabody, a frequent contributor to the traditional good causes favored by those of her class, did the unthinkable by volunteering to work as a hands-on caregiver to AIDS patients and their loved ones. 
Those patients were then mostly gay men, and, as Guy Trebay recently wrote in The Times, they were ''treated not with compassion but as bearers of plague.'' There was no drug regimen to combat AIDS, and there were many panicky rumors about how its death sentence could be spread through casual contact. People of all types and political persuasions shunned dying gay men even as they treated healthy gay men and lesbians as, at best, second-class citizens. The Times did not put the mysterious disease on Page 1 until after the casualty rate exceeded 500 and didn't start covering it in earnest until Rock Hudson died of AIDS three years after that. In 1985, the term ''gay'' itself was an untouchable for writers in this newspaper.
Thanks to Peabody's prominence, her example had a discernible effect in beating back ignorance and fear in New York. But 25 years ago, few could have imagined a larger narrative that might lead to full civil rights for gay Americans. That was change almost no one believed in. Nor could many have imagined that a day would come, as it did 10 days after Peabody's death, when a federal judge in San Francisco would rule it unconstitutional for same-sex couples to be denied the right to be lawfully wedded in sickness and in health. Yet here America is, in 2010, on the brink of seeing that issue reach the Supreme Court.
I didn't know Peabody, but I can only imagine that her determination to make a difference was in some part influenced by her mother-in-law, Mary Peabody. The wife of an Episcopal bishop and the mother of a governor of Massachusetts, Mary Peabody spent two nights in jail, at the age of 72, after participating in sit-ins to protest racial segregation in St. Augustine, Fla., in 1964. Many were baffled why a patrician grandmother of seven would travel thousands of miles to volunteer for a racial confrontation with police officers who were armed with tear gas, dogs and electric cattle prods. ''I shall go wherever I am asked to participate for freedom,'' she said.
The Peabody women were among the countless players in these larger civil rights dramas. They are testimony to the courage, big-heartedness and sense of fundamental fairness that can flower in our country in the most unexpected quarters even as the angrier and more malign voices dominate the debate. And sometimes over the long term -- an obscenely long term in the case of black civil rights -- the good guys and women can win real victories. Make no mistake about it: The Proposition 8 trial, Judge Vaughn Walker's decision and the subsequent reaction to it (as much a non-reaction as anything else) constitute a high point in America's history-long struggle to live up to its democratic ideals.
Much has been said about the triumph of the odd-couple legal team, the former Bush v. Gore adversaries Ted Olson and David Boies, who opposed Prop 8 in court. But of equal significance is the high-powered lawyer on the other side, Charles Cooper. He was named one of the 10 best civil litigators in Washington in the same National Law Journal list that included Olson and, in his pre-Supreme Court incarnation, John Roberts. Yet, as Judge Walker made clear in his 136-page judgment, Cooper, for all his talent and efforts, couldn't find facts to support his argument that full civil marital rights for same-sex couples would harm the institution of marriage, children or anyone else. Cooper only managed to summon two ''expert'' witnesses. In the judge's determination, one undermined his credibility by giving testimony contradicting his own opinions while the other provided ''evidence'' rendered worthless by its lack of scientific methodology or even fundamental peer-review vetting.
Boies and Olson produced nine expert witnesses with the relevant professional and academic expertise lacking in Cooper's duo and compiled an encyclopedic record of empirical findings that demolished the arguments for denying gay families equal rights under the law. In the understatement of The Economist, that record ''now seems a high hurdle'' for the Supreme Court to overturn. That could still happen, of course, and already there are signs of a campaign from the right to besmirch the likely swing justice, Anthony Kennedy. Though Kennedy was a Ronald Reagan appointee who wrote much of the unsigned decision in Bush v. Gore, that did not prevent him from being called ''the most dangerous man in America'' by the family-values czar James Dobson after Kennedy wrote a majority opinion decriminalizing gay sex in 2003.
There has already been an attempt to discredit Walker, who has never publicly discussed his sexual orientation but has been widely reported to be gay. The notion that a judge's sexuality, gay or not, might disqualify him from ruling on marriage is as absurd as saying Clarence Thomas can't rule on cases involving African-Americans. By this standard, the only qualified judge to rule on marital rights would be a eunuch. No less ridiculous has been the attempt to dismiss Walker as a liberal ''activist judge.'' Walker was another Reagan nominee to the federal bench, recommended by his attorney general, Edwin Meese (an opponent of same-sex marriage and, now, of Walker), in a December 1987 memo residing at the Reagan library. It took nearly two years and a renomination by the first President George Bush for Walker to gain Senate approval over opposition from Teddy Kennedy, the N.A.A.C.P., La Raza, the National Organization for Women and the many gay groups who deemed his record in private practice too conservative.
The attacks on Walker have fizzled fast. With rare exceptions from the hysterical fringe -- Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich -- most political leaders have either remained silent about the Prop 8 decision (the Republican National Committee) or punted (the Obama White House). Over at Fox News, Ted Olson silenced the states'-rights argument in favor of Prop 8 last weekend by asking Chris Wallace: ''Would you like Fox's right to a free press put up to a vote and say, well, if five states have approved it, let's wait till the other 45 states do?'' (No answer was forthcoming.)
Most of those who do argue for denying marriage equality to gay couples are now careful to say that they really, really like gay people. This, like the states'-rights argument, is a replay of the battle over black civil rights. Eric Foner, the pre-eminent historian of Reconstruction, recalled last week via e-mail how Strom Thurmond would argue in the early 1960s ''that segregation benefited blacks and whites and had nothing to do with racism'' -- as if inequality were O.K. as long as segregationists pushing separate-but-equal ''compromises'' claimed their motives were pure.
Still another recurrent argument from the Thurmond era has it that no judge should overrule the voters, who voted 52 to 48 percent in California for Prop 8 in 2008. But as Olson also told Chris Wallace, ''We do not put the Bill of Rights to a vote.'' It's far from certain in any event that a majority of California voters approve of Prop 8 now. A Field poll released two weeks before Walker's ruling found that Californians approved of same-sex marital rights by 51 to 42 percent. Last week a CNN survey for the first time found that a majority of Americans (52 percent) believed ''gays and lesbians should have a constitutional right to get married.''
None of this means that full equality for gay Americans is a done deal. Even if it were, that would be scant consolation to the latest minority groups to enter the pantheon of American scapegoats, Hispanic immigrants and Muslims. We are still a young, imperfect, unfinished country. As a young black man working as a nurse in a 1980s AIDS clinic memorably says in Tony Kushner's epic drama ''Angels in America'': ''The white cracker who wrote the national anthem knew what he was doing. He set the word 'free' to a note so high nobody can reach it.''
But sometimes we do hit that note, however tentatively. How one wishes that the many gay Americans who were left to die in the shadows during that horrific time -- and, in most cases, without a Judith Peabody, let alone a legal spouse, by their side -- could hear Judge Walker's clarion call.

HEADLINE: In Some Classes, Buyers Are Not Ready to Give Up Their V-8s

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
CARS around the world are making do with fewer cylinders to save fuel; the engine of the Tata Nano, to cite one extreme case, has just two.
Yet this is America, land of cheap gasoline and home of the brave V-8, a country where 4-cylinder engines have mainly populated rental fleets and econocars. So the question nags: how low are we willing to go in the cylinder count, especially for models that stake their images on power and prestige?
Ford has already made waves with the announcement that its EcoBoost 4-cylinder will be available in the redesigned Explorer. But cowboys, urban and otherwise, might swallow their Skoal if they see 4-cylinder engines in a new, smaller pickup that carries an F-Series badge, an idea that Ford has said it is considering. 
Chevrolet has tested a turbo 4 in its muscle-car Camaro. Efficient power aside, that might spark bad flashbacks to the Iron Duke, the notorious 90-horsepower 4-cylinder that came in the Camaro beginning in 1982.
Jesse Toprak, vice president for industry trends at TrueCar.com, a shopping site, said that automakers will largely test America's small-engine appetite in safer categories.
''If you're looking at a starter Camaro, there might be merit in offering a powerful 4-cylinder,'' he said.
But in cars above roughly $40,000, some buyers are still likely to resist. Among luxury brands here, Audi has enjoyed the most 4-cylinder success, thanks to notably silky turbo versions in models like the A4 sedan.
In Europe, where large-displacement engines are often exorbitantly taxed and many luxury buyers shy away from in-your-face consumption, brands offer buyers the option of removing exterior clues of what is under the hood.
In fact, top Audi executives including Peter Schwarzenbauer, an Audi A.G. board member with responsibility for marketing and sales, said that Audi plans to eliminate engine-identifying badges entirely on cars sold in Europe. While every luxury automaker is scaling down power plants to meet mileage and emissions regulations, Audi executives say Americans will favor larger cars with muscular engines as long as they enjoy vastly cheaper gas than most of the rest of the world.
''In some models,'' Mr. Schwarzenbauer says, ''it has to be a V-8. Nothing else counts.''
That notion may be supported by BMW's recent experience with the introduction of a 6-cylinder version of its flagship 7 Series sedan, the 2011 740i. Jim O'Donnell, president of BMW of North America, said Americans had been slow to embrace the car, a 315-horsepower version of a sedan typically powered by a twin turbo V-8 -- though he explained that part of the reason was the lack of an all-wheel-drive option on the 6-cylinder model .
Even so, on paper the 740i, the first 6-cylinder 7 Series sold here since 1992, seems to be a smart choice. It costs at least $7,000 less than the comparably equipped V-8 model; at 25 highway m.p.g., it offers a 3 m.p.g. advantage; and it accelerates nearly as quickly.
Yet Mr. Toprak says the slow sales aren't surprising.
''People who buy a 7 Series or S-Class buy the image,'' he said. ''They're not comparing numbers, and they're certainly not spending $80,000 to own a 6-cylinder.''

HEADLINE: The Folk Hero Playbook

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY

 BODY:
The man does not have his own talk show. Not yet, anyway.
But if there were a formula for becoming a folk hero -- a secret recipe handed down from Robin Hood's cap designer, and adapted for the social networking era -- then Steven Slater, formerly an active employee of JetBlue Airlines, may as well have discovered it.
Ever since Mr. Slater, a flight attendant, stormed off the job early last week after apparently telling off a rude passenger, he has become paparazzi chum, a working person's James Dean. Fans have set up a Steven Slater Facebook page, shout-outs are pouring in from every corner of the Internet, and at least three Slater ballads are making the rounds on YouTube. 
All that love may yet go sour, as recent reports have challenged Mr. Slater's account. But by late Friday, he was still the talk of the town.
''He's a seemingly ordinary person who acted out this collective longing, a longing that wasn't necessarily noticeable -- that many people didn't know they had, until they saw it,'' said Todd Gitlin, a professor of journalism and sociology at Columbia University. ''It's kind of perfect, for these days when everyone hates being on an airplane, and wants nothing more than to break out, and with pizazz, if possible.''
Cultural historians generally divide folk heroes loosely into several categories. One is reserved for acts of spectacular courage and skill, and includes Capt. Chesley B. Sullenberger III, who landed a US Airways jet on the Hudson River in 2009 and took charge of the safe evacuation of all 155 people aboard. Another is populated by political figures, like the abolitionist John Brown, or Michael Collins, the Irish revolutionary.
The third is a rogue's gallery of daring but flawed solo actors who become heroes precisely because of their sympathetic failings, and their willingness to risk their life or livelihood in the name of defying the Man (or the Woman, in Mr. Slater's account). And, it must be said, to do so with some flair. Mr. Slater snagged two beers and popped the emergency exit chute, sliding out of the parked airliner like James Bond on a tight budget.
In all the above respects, the flight attendant has less in common with the ideologue or selfless hero than with D. B. Cooper, the skyjacker who in 1971 parachuted out of an airplane with a bag of ransom money, into a densely wooded patch of Washington State. Both men jumped from a plane to an uncertain fate; both made their statements in dramatic fashion, in front of an audience; both were, in some sense, instantly sympathetic outlaws.
The same might even be said of Colton Harris-Moore, better known as the Barefoot Bandit, a teenage thief who zigzagged across the continent, often in stolen speedboats and planes, outfoxing the authorities until he was captured in July.
Mr. Slater is hardly a criminal, in the way those two were. But he does qualify as a ''bandit hero,'' in terms of the symbolism of his dramatic defiance, and its effect on the public imagination, said Alexander Fink, an economist at George Mason University and co-author of the paper ''Bandit Heroes: Mythical, Social, or Rational?'' due to appear in The American Journal of Economics and Sociology.
Mr. Fink and Nicholas A. Curott, another economist at George Mason, argue that so-called bandit heroes are so admired because they openly jab a finger in the eye of oppressive authority, whether intrusive government or, in Mr. Slater's case, an overbearing workplace. The act imposes costs on that authority and demonstrates to those who chafe under it that they, too, have the power and opportunity to resist.
''In economic terms, the cost of the flight attendant's actions was concentrated on the airline, and the benefits were dispersed widely throughout the population, to other flight attendants, to waitresses, to people who work in restaurants, in hotels, to any person who perceives himself or herself in a position of being coerced into work they don't want to do,'' Mr. Fink said. ''They derive utility from having witnessed this act,'' its very symbolism providing psychological lift.
By breaking oppressive constraints, the bandits are, wittingly or not, demanding a fairer system. ''At times bandits benefit ordinary members of society by providing a system of rules and accompanying enforcement where the government fails to do so,'' the economists conclude in their paper. In recent posts to airline employees' Web sites, a man identifying himself as Steven Slater expressed exasperation at a system that pitted passengers against the very people who serve them.
In his interviews, Mr. Slater has expressed little interest in being anyone's folk hero. But that only makes him harder to resist. Perhaps best of all, the millions of service workers and frustrated airline passengers out there don't have to romanticize a crook.
If his story holds up, Mr. Slater was trying to strike a blow for civility. He's a bandit in a white hat.

HEADLINE: SWEAT; 1! (Stroke) 2! (Stroke) Sit Up! Stop Chatting!

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
The races were a week away and the Dragonflies were anxious.
Their strokes were not in sync; the first five looked a little choppy and confused. They were digging deeper into the water than they should have at the start. They had entered GPS data into Google Earth and found their speed was 10 kilometers an hour; the ideal was 12.5.
''You look a little tense,'' Victor Li, a captain, said to the team. ''You've been practicing for eight weeks already. So all you have to do is focus and relax.'' 
The drummer, sitting above the elaborately painted dragon head in the bow of the 38-foot boat, raised her baton. ''Sit up!'' she shouted. ''Attention! Paddles ready!'' Sixteen backs were bent; 16 oars thrust into the water. The baton came down and the drummer counted as she banged her drum. ''One!'' (stroke) ''Two!'' (stroke) ''Three!'' (stroke) ''Four!'' The boat surged forward: paddles reaching, shoulders straining, sweat breaking out, coffee-colored water trailing in its wake.
The team was preparing for the 20th annual Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival in New York, where 173 teams would join a maritime tradition that stretches back to 278 B.C., when Chinese fishermen tried to rescue an exiled poet who had thrown himself into the Ni Lo River. But as with many of New York's cultural imports, a flavor of the living city has seasoned its immigrant roots.At last week's races, Goldman Sachs had a team; Con Edison did, too. (The New York Times was among the sponsors.) The racers were mainly of Asian descent, but there were also unemployed Brazilians and Canadian college professors, Italians wearing unitards and straight-up American dudes with shaved heads and fashionable goatees.
''At one point, I wanted to make a family tree of our team because the connections are just so strange,'' said Katrina Barnes, a 31-year-old administrator at the Columbia Business School, who has been racing with the Dragonflies for years. ''It's mostly friends of friends. Or, friends of friends of friends.''
Or, in one case, the friend of the sister of a man who went to high school with a Dragonfly.
The team was founded 10 years ago by Eric Alberts, an instructor at the Art Students League in Manhattan who died last month, at 70. According to the Dragonflies' Facebook page, under his leadership the team believed in ''loud bossy drummers, good managers, great steerers, bad karaoke and lots of goofy fun.''
The first of these was in evidence at the practice two weeks ago, when the drummer was Skye Stein, a mother of two who lives in Chinatown and has been racing since sixth grade. She barked at her teammates like the strictest of kindergarten teachers: ''Eyes on me! Stop chatting! Show me discipline!''
Dragon boating is ''about 18 people trying to work as one,'' explained Jason Luo, 31, the steerer. ''It's about teamwork.''
Between the drummer and the steerer sit eight rows of paddlers, typically split evenly by gender.
The first row of two are known as pacers - they set the vessel's stroke rate. The next five rows form the ''engine room'' - they provide the power. Four more paddlers sit beneath the steerer and help out as they can. ''It's basically the goof-off area,'' said Katrina Barnes, 31, a longtime Dragonfly. ''The drummer can't see you back there.''
Among the teams competing last weekend in the mud-brown lake in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park were the Fierce Dragons, the Azumi Dragons, the New York Wall Street Dragons, the Electric Dragons, the Ionizing Dragons and the Red Lotus Dragons.
The Dragonflies arrived at 6:30 a.m. Under a pavilion tent: lox and bagels. There was no bad karaoke, but there was ample goofy fun. Racers dozed on yoga mats. Racers watched other races. Some ate lychee nuts and hummus. Others strolled around the festival, taking in Chinese ginger sodas, carnival games and traditional Asian folk bands.
''A lot of today is about sitting around and eating,'' Ms. Barnes said. ''Or eating and sitting around.''
A half-hour before their 11:24 a.m. start, the Dragonflies got serious. There were jumping jacks and stretches in the parking lot, and speeches by the captains, Mr. Li, 33, an import-export agent, and Stanley Mok, 36, who works in information technology. It was decided that their two opponents - the Syngent Seadogs and the Metro-Athletic Dragons - were formidable. In this, a 250-meter heat, a vigorous start was critical. ''The race is won in the first five strokes,'' Mr. Mok said. ''So: deep, powerful strokes.''
Henry Wan, the festival's chairman, had explained, earlier, the emotion of his sport. ''For the first few weeks of practice, everybody's calm, the weather's nice,'' he said. ''Then overnight people get serious. We see it every year. On the day of the race, you shake somebody's hand and you say to yourself, 'Oh, he's serious.' ''
By 11:15, the Dragonflies had their racing faces on; also, blue life jackets. Each Seadog looked bigger than the next. The Metro-Athletic Dragons wore skin-tight jerseys of muscle-gripping black.
Viewed from shore, the race unfolded slowly: three boats punching forward, pausing, then jolting up again. The Metro-Athletic team won, in 1:09:62. Less than one second separated the Seadogs (1:12:88) and the Dragonflies (1:13:41).
There was, though, a consolation prize: a race among the teams not advancing to the finals. This, the Dragonflies decided, they would win.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Deadly Heat Wave And a Roosevelt's Rise

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
HOT enough for you? In 1896, a blazing 10-day heat wave killed nearly 1,500 New Yorkers and, arguably, burnished the progressive and populist credentials of a young police commissioner named Theodore Roosevelt. 
Edward P. Kohn, a historian, brings that forgotten natural disaster to light in ''Hot Time in the Old Town: The Great Heat Wave of 1896 and the Making of Theodore Roosevelt'' (Basic Books, $27.95). While Roosevelt was elevated by having the streets hosed and delivering ice to the poor, Professor Kohn argues, the presidential ambitions of William Jennings Bryan, who came to town to accept the Democratic nomination, evaporated. Nearly 10,000 fans braved the heat to hear him in Madison Square Garden; by the time he finished, fewer than half remained.
''The average victim of the heat wave was a workingman, probably Irish, living in the most impoverished and squalid of conditions,'' Professor Kohn writes. ''As he and his brethren died, the philanthropists of the Progressive Era called for reform on all levels: of working conditions and work hours, of housing conditions, of sanitary conditions, of government conditions that allowed corruption and of economic conditions that had made New Yorkers of August 1896 so susceptible to death and disease in the first place.''
''Such changes would take decades,'' he concludes, ''but a natural disaster occurring during such an age of reform created a potent catalyst for change.''
''As American society continues to become more virtual, less hands-on,'' Jessica DuLong writes, ''I'm a salmon swimming upstream.'' Ms. DuLong did her figurative swimming as a licensed engineer on a decommissioned 130-foot-long fireboat on the Hudson and as part of the crew that served at ground zero.
She delivers an engaging narrative of maritime history and her own hands-on perceptions in ''My River Chronicles:Rediscovering the Work That Built America: A Personal and Historical Journey'' (Trade paperback, $16).
''Unequal Fortunes: Snapshots From the South Bronx'' (Teachers College Press, $24.95) lives up to its title. Arthur Levine and his contemporaries living near Creston Avenue in the 1960s did not share the same opportunities, but the level of inequality among them pales compared with the gap between youngsters 40 years ago and those who live in the same neighborhood today.
In this part-memoir, part-meditation -- embellished by reporting -- Mr. Levine, a former president of Teachers College at Columbia, and Laura Scheiber, a doctoral student at the college, revisit his old neighborhood to explore why some students never even visualize the American dream, much less achieve it, while others overcome the odds.
These snapshots of a young man who is shot dead in front of the building where Mr. Levine was raised and of two others who graduate from college provide a moving picture of corrosive urban inequities.
The authors pair their glimmer of hope with sound prescriptions, citing the programs I Have a Dream, Harlem Children's Zone and Say Yes to Education.

HEADLINE: Lehman, The Longer View

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
AS the global economy struggles to recover from its crisis, here comes yet another dissection of a Wall Street firm -- this one of Lehman Brothers, whose collapse helped set off the mess. But this very readable book, ''The Last of the Imperious Rich: Lehman Brothers, 1844-2008'' (Portfolio, $27.95), by Peter Chapman, takes a unusually long view of the situation. It looks at the bank in the context of one and a half centuries of financial evolution.
Mr. Chapman's long-term perspective no doubt derives from his academic background and his perch on the far side of the Atlantic Ocean, distanced from Wall Street's myopic obsession with meeting quarterly profit goals. Based in London, he is a former BBC foreign correspondent who has worked at The Financial Times since 1995. He also holds a master's degree from the London School of Economics. 
The arc of Lehman Brothers can be divided into two very different periods, one very long and the other quite short. Mr. Chapman devotes the bulk of his book to the first, which spans the 140 years between the patriarch's arrival in America in 1844 and the sale of the firm to American Express in 1984.
That patriarch, Henry Lehman, and his siblings were part of a vast wave of nearly a million German immigrants during the mid-19th century, and they started as itinerant peddlers. The Lehmans made the leap into barter finance after the collapse of a state bank in Alabama.
Presenting himself as ''the farmer's friend,'' Henry allowed his customers to pay for goods in cotton rather than cash. Contrasting those early days with ominous times to come, Mr. Chapman notes that ''the origin of the business that eventually became Lehman Brothers was solid practical goods that you could see and touch.''
During the Civil War, Emanuel and Mayer Lehman, brothers of Henry, became blockade runners for the Confederate cause, ferrying cargos of cotton past Union gun ships. Upon moving to New York after the war, the Lehmans joined the Goldman and Sachs families as part of the financial establishment. They later financed the development of brands like Sears Roebuck, Woolworth, Pan American Airways, Hertz, Helena Rubinstein cosmetics and the RKO film studio, and advised the likes of RCA and the United Fruit Company.
Through the late 1960s, Lehman Brothers continued to be owned and operated mainly by family members, the most celebrated of whom was Bobbie Lehman. An art-collecting, polo-playing friend of elite families like the Hitchcocks and the Harrimans, Bobbie was known as the ''aristocrat of the autocrats.'' But he also had ''the common touch'' and an instinctual ability to size up people.
In 1973, Pete Peterson, a former chief of the Bell & Howell camera company and a secretary of commerce under President Richard M. Nixon, became Lehman Brothers' new lead partner. During the four years since Bobbie Lehman's death, the firm had languished.
Using both diplomatic and financial skills, Mr. Peterson made at least a temporary peace between warring factions of investment bankers and traders, and increased the firm's capital tenfold. But in 1983, Mr. Peterson agreed to leave under pressure from his co-head, Lewis Glucksman. The next year, the remaining partners sold to American Express, which already owned the Shearson brokerage firm, for $380 million.
Thus began the second, far more star-crossed part of the Lehman Brothers saga. After seven years as a vassal of American Express, the firm regained its independence under the leadership of the former head trader Richard S. Fuld Jr..
According to Mr. Chapman, Mr. Fuld was known for having ''a digital mind,'' but was nicknamed ''the Gorilla'' because of an often-monosyllabic communication style.
As Mr. Fuld endeavored to unite the still-warring factions of traders and bankers under the motto ''One Firm,'' he steered Lehman Brothers out of conventional commodity trading and ever deeper into subprime mortgage bonds and financial derivatives like collateralized debt obligations, Mr. Chapman writes.
Lehman Brothers continued to report glowing financial results, announcing earnings of $4 billion for the year ended in November 2007. Two years later, an inquiry by an outside financial examiner asserted that results had been affected by the practice of moving as much as $50 billion in debts off of the books and into what was known as a Repo 105 transaction.
Lehman Brothers' demise comes about as swiftly as Mr. Chapman's account, which covers the nine months leading to the firm's bankruptcy in less than 11 pages.
AMONG the more poignant moments that Mr. Chapman describes occurred on the fateful weekend of Sept. 13-14, 2008, when Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, let it be known that Mr. Fuld was not welcome at the deliberations over Lehman's fate at the office of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. Mr. Fuld did pepper the meeting with phone calls from Lehman headquarters, but his ideas were ignored, the book says.
''The Last of the Imperious Rich'' offers virtually nothing new in the way of reporting about the internal dramas related to Lehman Brothers' collapse. And Mr. Chapman tends to go off on tangents about subjects ranging from McCarthyism to Communism to the economic policies of President Bill Clinton. But the historical parallels that the author provides are often thought-provoking and illuminating.
Not the least of these is his closing observation that a firm that began peddling dry goods in Alabama lost its way when it became enamored of financial derivatives and got ''caught peddling junk to the world.''

HEADLINE: The Second Coming

BYLINE: By JONATHAN MAHLER. 
Jonathan Mahler, a contributing writer, is the author of ''The Challenge: How a Maverick Navy Officer and a Young Law Professor Risked Their Careers to Defend the Constitution -- and Won,'' which is out in paperback.

 BODY:
LAST MONTH, ANDREW Cuomo took some time off from his job as New York's attorney general, rented a recreational vehicle and drove upstate with his three daughters on an 11-day campaign swing with a little family vacation mixed in: ''Camp Campaign'' is how Cuomo joked about it with me. The trip infelicitously coincided with what turned out to be a historic heat wave across New York, and he couldn't get the R.V.'s air-conditioning to work. At his first stop, a community college in Rockland County, Cuomo emerged from the Gulf Stream, his blazer slung uncharacteristically over his shoulder and a bead or two of sweat on his forehead, calling his new vehicle ''a toaster oven on wheels.'' 
A few days later, I met up with Cuomo about 90 minutes northwest of the city, in Middletown, to ride with him in the R.V. He was sporting his usual campaign outfit -- white shirt, blue tie, navy jacket, pleated chinos and high-gloss black dress shoes. (This is Cuomo's idea of casual.) Cuomo spoke to a crowd of about 50 in the local library for 15 minutes, then climbed back behind the wheel of the R.V., and we set off for the next stop. ''Watch this,'' he said as he steered the ungainly vehicle around a sharp corner in the city's small downtown, crossing well over into the oncoming lane.
It was an unusual campaign trip, and not just because the candidate was doing the driving and taking afternoons off to hang out with his daughters. Cuomo wasn't so much trawling for votes -- he doesn't seem to have a lot to worry about there -- as he was trying to build support for his ''citizens' campaign'' to take back Albany. At each event, campaign volunteers with clipboards collected signatures for Cuomo's five-point pledge to reform New York State's government. ''This campaign is as much about January as it is about November,'' Cuomo told me. ''I want the whole state singing in the same voice, and the name of the song is 'Change Albany Now!' ''
The song may sound familiar. Three and a half years ago, another crusading attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, rode his soaring popularity into the state's grand Capitol building, pledging to cleanse Albany. He soon found himself mired in the muck instead, groping his way from one mess to another. Cuomo bristles at comparisons to Spitzer. He goes to great lengths to avoid being quoted about him -- that would be too Spitzer-esque -- but lets it be known why: he's more diplomatic, he knows Albany inside out, he has a passion for governing.
Even if you doubt Cuomo's characterization of himself, and plenty do, there is reason to believe that New York State has finally arrived at a moment when such bold promises of reform might amount to more than just tilting at windmills. Populist outrage is building over the state's historically untouchable public-employee unions, with their ever-expanding pensions and outdated culture of unfireable workers and overpaid bureaucrats. Joe Bruno, the former boxer and longtime State Senate Republican majority leader who gave Spitzer fits, is finally gone, having retired in the midst of an F.B.I. investigation that eventually revealed (what else?) influence-peddling. The legislative scandals have reached almost farcical proportions: a senator from the Bronx, Pedro Espada Jr., stands accused -- perhaps not coincidentally by Attorney General Cuomo -- of spending $20,000 in state and federal grant money on takeout sushi that was delivered to his house in Westchester County. Whether or not Cuomo is the right man, this would certainly seem to be the right moment. ''People have had it,'' Cuomo told me, as the R.V. labored north. ''They are attuned, they are on the edge of their seats and they are angry.'' With his citizens' campaign, Cuomo is now trying to transform that inchoate sense of anger and despair into a list of demands that voters can nail to the door of the Capitol.
When you spend time with Andrew Cuomo, it can be easy to forget that a little more than two election cycles ago his personal life was in shambles and his political career appeared to be over. In 2002, Cuomo insisted on taking on New York's comptroller, Carl McCall, for the Democratic nomination for governor, despite the urgings of the state's most prominent Democrats (including its newest residents, the Clintons). Cuomo fell behind in the polls and then uttered the phrase that marked the end of his first gubernatorial candidacy. Bantering with reporters on a campaign bus en route to Buffalo, he tried to make political hay of 9/11, saying that Gov. George Pataki, who defeated Cuomo's father in 1994, had taken a back seat to Rudy Giuliani after the attacks -- that he had, in Cuomo's words, ''held the leader's coat.'' Cuomo pulled out of the primary, humiliated, and was soon engaged in a nasty public divorce and child-custody battle with his wife of 13 years, Kerry Kennedy.
After disappearing from public life for a couple of years -- ''that was a personal growth period,'' Cuomo says wryly -- he lowered his sights and ran for attorney general in 2006. He campaigned relentlessly and easily defeated the Republican candidate (and fellow Albany Law School alumnus), Jeanine Pirro. Now Cuomo appears poised to complete his political comeback by winning the job that his father held for three terms and that he has coveted for the better part of a decade.
That Cuomo has become New York's dominant Democrat figure is something of a political miracle. It can be attributed both to his popularity as attorney general and to the spectacular collapses of his would-be competitors. Spitzer, who most people assumed would be governor for at least two terms, resigned in March 2008 after being forced to acknowledge that he was a regular customer at an escort service. His successor, David Paterson, called a press conference the day after he was sworn into office to admit that he, too, had engaged in extramarital sex and was soon under investigation for a variety of other misdeeds, including interfering in a domestic-abuse complaint involving one of his senior aides.
The governor's office of the State of New York has fallen quite a way since the days of Grover Cleveland, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Nelson Rockefeller. Once a gateway to national office, Albany is now where political careers go to die. Given the situation that New York's next chief executive stands to inherit, it's hard to believe that he is going to be the one to reverse this trend. Even setting aside New York's general ungovernability, the state faces a fiscal crisis that many economists say is more dire than the one New York City experienced when it nearly went broke in the 1970s.
In the midst of such forbidding conditions -- not to mention the still, uncomfortably warm air inside the R.V. -- Cuomo seemed to be in high spirits as we made our way toward a community center in Monticello. He prodded his daughters to sing ''Chantilly Lace'' along with him. ''I ain't got noooo money, honey,'' he sang. ''That's like New York's budget,'' he said. ''We ain't go noooo money, honey.''
Driving into the downtown area, we were suddenly surrounded by shuttered storefronts. ''Guys, you looking around?'' Cuomo said to his daughters. ''What kind of shape is this area in, you think?'' The scene was a powerful reminder of yet another challenge that Cuomo will face if he is elected: resuscitating upstate New York's long-depressed economy.
I joked to Cuomo's daughters that he was going to fix the blight around us. ''See all of this?'' Cuomo said. ''I'm in charge!''
ON A SUNNY SATURDAY afternoon in May, after months of evasiveness -- deja vu: another Cuomo was refusing to declare his political intentions -- Andrew Cuomo finally made his candidacy official. The announcement took place on a small stage that had been erected in City Hall Park in Downtown Manhattan, directly behind the old Tweed Courthouse, which now houses the city's Department of Education but remains, in the public imagination anyway, a monument to that enduring icon of government corruption, Boss Tweed, who embezzled a fortune from the city under the cover of the building's construction. For the few who hadn't already picked up on the less-than-subtle symbolism, Cuomo spelled it out. ''Albany's antics today would make Boss Tweed blush,'' he told the crowd, gesturing toward the courthouse.
Cuomo's father, Mario, who presided over New York State from 1983 through 1994, once famously said that politicians campaign in poetry and govern in prose. The son's campaign rhetoric is pretty much poetry-free. Andrew Cuomo favors short, declarative sentences and unvarnished imagery. In contrast with his father, he doesn't articulate values, summon ideals or transmit visions. Like a mechanic poking his head out from under the hood of your broken-down car, he tells you what's wrong with your engine and how he's going to fix it. This is not to say that Cuomo is an ineffective speaker. His speeches may not soar, but they do have a plain-spoken force. ''Our message today is simple: enough is enough,'' Cuomo said outside the Tweed Courthouse. ''It's time for the people of the Empire State to strike back.''
The difference between Mario's and Andrew's speaking styles reflects their starkly different manners. Mario, a voracious reader who writes almost daily in his diary, comes across as deep-thinking and empathic. He is complicated -- a searching intellectual as well as a man of the people -- and he has the air of someone who never expected to be in a position of power, which is precisely why you trusted him with that power. Andrew, who spends his free time riding a Harley-Davidson and tinkering with cars, comes across as straightforward and self-confident, not a wise man but a smart guy. He is not introspective or philosophical; his intelligence is intuitive and blunt. He strikes you as someone who follows his instincts and is comfortable, maybe too comfortable, being in charge.
Cuomo's precipitous fall has now become part of his political narrative; it provides an organic explanation for what is being cast as his newfound humility. ''Before that, Andrew knew only success,'' his father told me. And Cuomo's improbable comeback story makes for a handy metaphor when he talks about what he's hoping to do with New York. ''With the help of true friends and my family, I built back,'' he says in his campaign video. Unlike Spitzer, Cuomo would arrive in Albany having already survived the abasement that seems to afflict so many New York politicians.
Now that he has repurposed that dark period in his life, essentially reducing it to campaign rhetoric, Cuomo has no interest in revisiting it. When I asked him how he spent those years, he deflected my question with a joke: ''I was walking on hot coals.'' (For the record, Cuomo spent at least part of that time making seven figures working for a real estate developer.)
Some of the work that Cuomo has done as attorney general could help stir up the populist outrage that he's counting on to break the stagnant culture of Albany. Among other things, Cuomo has aggressively pursued pension-padding in the public sector as well as a handful of high-profile government-corruption cases, most notably the lawsuit he filed against Espada for ''looting'' $14 million in state and federal money from the network of health clinics that Espada founded.
As attorney general, Cuomo embraced Spitzer's expansive view of the office's power and reach. At the same time, though, he steered the office in a different direction from his predecessor, who built his reputation -- not to mention his candidacy for governor -- on the back of a ceaseless barrage of high-profile Wall Street prosecutions. Cuomo is not a natural prosecutor; he is a natural politician. He was determined to focus on cases that would resonate more forcefully with New York's working class and then to build those cases into something bigger than just straightforward prosecutions or fat settlements. Upon taking office, he put out the word among his deputies that he was less interested in pursuing individual companies for wrongdoing than in finding examples of systemic abuse. He didn't want to hold up scalps of C.E.O.'s at his press conferences; he wanted his victims intact and contrite, pledging to do business differently in the future.
The strategy is perhaps best embodied by what it is now seen as Cuomo's signature case. Early in Cuomo's tenure, a staff lawyer briefed a couple of Cuomo's deputies about a student-loan company that was essentially paying kickbacks to several colleges to be recommended by the schools' financial-aid officers to their students. Cuomo's senior staff soon learned that the practice was widespread. Because most student-loan companies and colleges in the country do at least some business with New York consumers, Cuomo had all of the grounds he needed to begin a nationwide investigation. The settlements he extracted were small: one offender, Sallie Mae, a nearly $6 billion company, paid just $2 million. Instead, Cuomo used his leverage to press companies and colleges to adopt a new code of conduct obliging them to sever their financial ties with one another and then drafted a bill to enshrine the code in New York State law.
Cuomo has been widely praised for his work as attorney general. But he's the first to admit that it's hard to fail when you possess the threat of subpoena. ''This office has absolute power,'' he told me in his office one day, rapping his knuckles on the coffee table in front of him for effect. ''Here I can sit you down and say, 'You settle, or here's the indictment.' '' The governor is comparatively unarmed. He has little more than a bully pulpit with which to persuade or cajole a firmly entrenched Legislature that is perfectly happy with the status quo and altogether adept at preserving it.
ANDREW CUOMO, WHO will turn 53 in December, ran his first political campaign -- his father's original gubernatorial bid against Ed Koch -- almost 30 years ago and has been a fixture of the national media almost ever since.
For a long time, Cuomo was comfortable with the attention. When he was in his late 20s, he piled reporters into his Ford Bronco to take them on tours of the low-income housing that HELP U.S.A., the nonprofit organization he founded for the homeless, built in Brooklyn and the South Bronx. (Cuomo didn't just woo reporters this way: on his first date with Kerry Kennedy, he took her to one of his housing complexes in Bedford-Stuyvesant.) As the head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the late '90s, he was known among the Washington press corps as Bill Clinton's most accessible and quotable cabinet secretary.
That Andrew Cuomo is a distant memory. During his tenure as attorney general, Cuomo's unwillingness to speak to the media became a story of its own: the cable news channel NY1 created a ''Cuomo Clock'' to track the number of days that he had rejected the network's requests to come on its politics program.
The new strategy -- the managing of the once-unmanageable Andrew Cuomo -- has been part of a broader rehabilitation and reinvention of his image. His ill-considered comment about Pataki spoke to a larger problem: a perception that Cuomo was too brash, too arrogant, too self-aggrandizing. If Mario Cuomo's Achilles' heel had always been his ambivalent relationship with his ambition, Andrew Cuomo's was his unambivalent relationship with his. At HUD, he cranked out press releases at a furious pace and traveled so frequently that one Republican senator, Kit Bond, kept track of his itinerary. Shortly before leaving office in 2000, Cuomo ordered the printing of 30,000 copies of a 150-page, glossy brochure reviewing his accomplishments at HUD; it cost $688,000 and was titled ''Vision for Change.'' Add to this the lingering impression that Cuomo was either directly or indirectly behind much of the unflattering tabloid coverage of his soon-to-be-ex-wife's affair with a polo-playing restaurateur, and it seemed as if the most-sensible approach would be for him to just put his head down and do his job.
In May, when I was still trying to get my first interview with Cuomo, I ran into one of his senior staff members at the Democratic State Convention in Westchester County.
''Are you getting what you need?'' he asked.
''Actually, no,'' I said.
''Perfect,'' he replied, only half-joking.
A few weeks later, though, I got a call from another member of the attorney general's staff, inviting me to come see Cuomo. His office is in the old Equitable Building in Lower Manhattan, not far from the construction site at ground zero. Cuomo, a physically imposing man with strong shoulders and big, beefy hands, met me near the elevators on the 25th floor. Entering his neatly ordered office, I was reminded of a story I heard a few days earlier from someone who worked with him on Walter Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign. When Cuomo was brought in for some extra firepower in the weeks before the New York primary, his first act was to roam campaign headquarters with a bottle of Fantastik and spray down all the desks.
Cuomo likes to describe himself as a middle-class kid from Queens (another point of distinction with regard to Spitzer, born into a wealthy Manhattan family). Coming from someone who was married to a Kennedy, it's a discordant note to strike. Still, Cuomo is fighting the image that he is political royalty, and it is true that during his formative years, his father had not yet entered politics. (The second oldest of five siblings, Cuomo used to call his younger brother, Christopher, who grew up in Albany, ''mansion boy.'') What's more, for all the talk of the creation of a new Democratic dynasty, the Cuomo-Kennedy merger was always an awkward fit. The Kennedys are an open, sprawling family that is un-self-conscious about its flaws. The Cuomos are tight-knit and tightly wound, fiercely protective of any chink that might be perceived as a sign of weakness or vulnerability.
Cuomo got his first exposure to Albany following the 1982 campaign, staying on as a special assistant to the governor after his father won the election. Within a couple of years, however, he was out on his own. He did a stint in the Manhattan district attorney's office, then joined a Park Avenue law firm -- briefly driving a Jaguar with ''AMC ESQ'' vanity plates -- before creating HELP. He parlayed his work on homelessness into a job as assistant secretary at HUD, and in 1997, when he was not quite 40, was appointed secretary.
Cuomo has a reputation for being irresistibly charming -- in addition to ruthless -- and he didn't disappoint. He told me, wistfully, that his youngest daughter, Michaela, who is 12, was just getting to the age where she is embarrassed by him, especially when he drops her off at school in his office-supplied vehicle, a black Chevrolet Suburban, or even worse, his muscle car. With that, Cuomo recreated the throb (''Boom! Boom! Boom!'') of his metallic blue G.T.O. pulling up at her junior high school in Mount Kisco, N.Y., where Cuomo lives with his girlfriend, the Food Network celebrity Sandra Lee.
Cuomo is still the same colorful talker he always was; the only difference is that he now goes off the record before saying anything that he worries might get him into trouble. Once engaged, he became keenly interested in how my story might advance his quest. (''You have to remind people that Albany wasn't always like this.'') In between our interviews, he called me unsolicited a few times -- ''Hi. It's Andrew Cuomo. Is this an O.K. time?'' -- to clarify or elaborate on a point. No doubt sensitive to the perception that he has an unseemly appetite for power, Cuomo played down his hunger for the governor's job, reminding me, as he used to tease his father, that it's a step down from being a cabinet secretary.
Most of the historical artifacts inside Cuomo's office are Clinton-related (handwritten notes; a New York Times crossword puzzle including the answer ''Cuomo,'' filled out and sent to him by Clinton; an empty humidor). There are surprisingly few reminders of Cuomo's father, and even fewer of their time in Albany, though there is a photo of the two of them playing basketball behind the governor's mansion around 1985. Andrew, who has a thick mane of black hair and is wearing a snug-fitting T-shirt and sweat pants, looks a little bit like John Travolta, circa ''Welcome Back, Kotter.'' Mario is guarding him, with a hand placed firmly on his son's back. ''He calls that a touch,'' Cuomo told me, crouching down in imitation of his father's posture on defense and laughing. ''I call it a push!''
At the same time that Cuomo officially became a gubernatorial candidate, he released a book-length manifesto, ''The New NY Agenda: A Plan for Action.'' The contrast it provided with the self-promotional brochure describing his work at Housing and Urban Development was stark and no doubt deliberate: the glossy color photos of Cuomo the HUD secretary posing with celebrities like Sarah Jessica Parker had been replaced by statistics, tables and footnotes.
''The New NY Agenda'' took shape over the course of the spring, with Cuomo and a group of his senior staff members from the attorney general's office meeting every Saturday to brainstorm and debate various points of policy. The book offers both a diagnosis of the state's myriad problems -- from the endemic corruption in the Legislature to the soaring cost of funding the pensions of state employees -- and a list of proposed solutions (some specific, others notably less so).
There are many different ways to measure the epic failure of New York State's government. Here are just a few: New York's public schools spend more per student than any other state -- a full two-thirds more than the national average -- and yet the state ranks 40th in the percentage of high-school students it graduates. New York also spends more than twice the national average per person on Medicaid, but it is in the middle of the pack in terms of performance and scrapes bottom when it comes to avoidable hospital costs. New York's unemployment rate recently hit an 18-year high of 8.9 percent.
In the face of these -- and plenty of other -- grim statistics, the state's lawmakers enjoy a rate of re-election that exceeds 95 percent. Statistically speaking, if you are a New York State assemblyman or senator, you are more likely to be chased out of office by political or personal scandal than to lose an election.
Taken broadly, Andrew Cuomo's agenda is to restore Albany to working order and get the state's spending under control. More specifically he is vowing to shake up the Legislature and end the corrosive influence of special-interest groups inside the statehouse. He is pledging to rewrite New York's lax campaign finance laws, to stop the practice of allowing lawmakers to draw their own electoral districts and to force legislators to disclose all outside sources of income. He also says he will freeze the wages and pensions of state employees and overhaul New York's Medicaid and education systems, which consume more than half of the state's annual budget. And he is promising to cap state property and corporate income taxes.
This has all been distilled into Cuomo's five-point, single-page pledge: clean up Albany; get the state's ''fiscal house in order''; ''rightsize'' its government; and restart its stalled-out economy. (The fifth point is a catch-all commitment to progressive issues like marriage equality.) Cuomo's campaign workers are taking the pledge door to door across the state, asking voters to commit to urging their legislators to support his agenda. Cuomo is also running a series of TV commercials intended to sell his specific proposals: an ad for a property-tax cap shows a series of glum-looking New Yorkers standing in front of their homes holding signs with large numbers across them (presumably their annual taxes). The idea is to prod voters to start jabbing away at Albany, to make its invulnerable legislators a little less so.
''Why is Albany Albany?'' Cuomo asked me once. ''Because it's been in the shadows. People didn't know what was going on up there. There was no populist voice. You have to bring the light. You have to bring the heat. You have to bring the scrutiny.'' As Cuomo sees it, succeeding where Spitzer failed depends in part on voters making angry phone calls and holding their representatives accountable. ''I didn't know you were paid by someone else,'' Cuomo says, imitating the voice of a concerned voter making the kind of call he's hoping to provoke. ''Who else pays you?''
Cuomo and his supporters like to call attention to the length of his campaign book: ''It's 250 pages, with footnotes!'' is a line heard often at Cuomo events. It's actually 224 pages, with extremely wide margins and generous spacing. Most of Cuomo's proposals are not novel -- on paper, his agenda looks a lot like Spitzer's -- and it would be a stretch to call ''The New NY Agenda'' a policy book. But it's still a serious piece of campaign literature to drop in one fell swoop, all the more so at the opening of a race, when candidates usually incline toward platitudes, to the ''poetry of politics.'' Cuomo has no Democratic competition, and according to the latest Quinnipiac poll, he is leading his Republican opponent, Rick Lazio, 56 percent to 26 percent. This gives him the luxury of sketching out his plans with at least some detail, even if not everyone is going to like what he has to say. And not everyone does. One prominent New York liberal told me that many progressives were ''horrified'' by Cuomo's apparent fiscal conservatism. ''Andrew is doing his best Chris Christie imitation,'' he told me, comparing Cuomo to New Jersey's Republican governor, who is furiously crusading to slash his state's budget.
Cuomo, a disciple of the Clinton-Gore movement to reinvent government, says he's envisioning a more considered approach to reducing the state's expenses: in short, he's going to do to Albany what he did to HUD. When Cuomo took over, the agency was known as something of a slush fund for shady slumlords and real estate developers. It had an ignoble history of corruption and neglect -- Reagan's housing secretary, Samuel Pierce, famously watched soap operas in his office -- and was a constant on the General Accounting Office's biannual watch list of government programs whose poor management made them prone to fraud. Cuomo's loyalists credit him with transforming HUD into an efficient, accountable model of good government. There is debate about this -- HUD, like many bureaucracies, is always being reinvented -- but over the course of his tenure, Cuomo did manage to get two of HUD's four main departments removed from the G.A.O. list, while cutting 15 percent of HUD's staff and streamlining its operations.
In his stump speeches, Cuomo often rails against the countless layers of bureaucracy that are draining the state's dwindling resources. ''There are 10,000 local governments in the state of New York,'' he said at the state convention. ''Ten thousand! Town, village, lighting district, water district, sewer district, a special district to count the other districts in case you missed a district.''
Cuomo talks a lot about how he's going to save the state money by ''consolidating'' state agencies and commissions and creating ''operating efficiencies.'' He says much less about the significant cuts he's going to have to make to the state's budget -- what hospitals he will close, what educational programs he will suspend -- if he intends to keep his campaign pledge to not raise taxes and, more to the point, to prevent New York from sliding any further into a financial abyss.
As strange as it sounds, the prospect of bankruptcy in the 1970s offered New York City a kind of salvation. It gave New York's leaders some much-needed leverage with their negotiating partners: were the city to file for bankruptcy, it would default on its obligations, and everyone would lose. The state's ongoing fiscal crisis is every bit as severe as the city's was; but without the looming threat of bankruptcy to throw the state's untenable financial situation into sharp relief -- states can't file for bankruptcy protection -- there has been no come-to-Jesus moment. The state Constitution mandates that the government make its bond payments and pension contributions. The only way for it do so in the face of declining revenues is to cut services and programs or raise taxes, which are already 79 percent above the national average.
In the coming years, New York's expenses are only going to rise, and in some cases significantly. To take one example, the cost of pensions and health benefits for active and retired state employees will increase to $6.2 billion in 2013-14 from $1.3 billion in 1998-99. Tax revenues from Wall Street, meanwhile, are shrinking, and the state's federal stimulus money, which has added up to about $6 billion annually since 2008, will be cut off in another year, two at most. One special income-tax increase that brought the state $4 billion a year is set to expire at the end of 2011. Some economists have estimated that next year's budget deficit could exceed $10 billion, and with the state's expenses increasing almost twice as fast as its revenues, the deficit is likely to grow radically from there. Chris Christie or not, New York's next governor is going to have to make some tough choices.
It's been noted that Cuomo has close financial and personal ties to the very special-interest groups that are contributing to the state's budget woes. A number of Albany power players have been generous donors to his well-financed campaign. Jennifer Cunningham, a lobbyist for the state's gargantuan health-workers' union, which can be expected to provide the most powerful opposition to reforming New York's bloated Medicaid system, helped run Cuomo's 2006 race for attorney general and continues to serve as an informal adviser to him.
In an interview last April with The New York Times, Spitzer raised doubts about whether Cuomo would be willing to confront the entrenched interests in Albany that have grown accustomed to the state's largess. ''I think the issue is, will he have the stomach to pick political fights or to pick fights that will have negative consequences?'' Spitzer said.
Spitzer and Cuomo have a history of mutual enmity dating to 2000, when Spitzer was attorney general and Cuomo was HUD secretary. Spitzer was working on an agreement to compel gun manufacturers to change the marketing and design of their products. Cuomo, with the backing of the White House, intervened, threatening to bring a lawsuit against the gunmakers on behalf of the nation's public-housing authorities and, in Spitzer's view, undercutting his own negotiations. In 2007, Cuomo and Spitzer were the opposing forces at the center of the affair known as Troopergate. (To abbreviate a long, complicated saga: Governor Spitzer asked Attorney General Cuomo to investigate the possible abuse of government travel privileges by Joe Bruno, the Republican leader of the state. Instead, Cuomo investigated Spitzer for having state troopers follow Bruno.)
Given Spitzer's well-known animosity toward Cuomo, his comments in The Times were rather restrained, but they nevertheless attracted a lot of attention in New York political circles. Cuomo has his detractors inside the Democratic Party -- one prominent Democrat who has tangled repeatedly with Cuomo described him to me as ''soulless, valueless and ambition incarnate'' -- but they are far too scared of him to criticize him on the record. The old Andrew Cuomo probably would have retaliated against Spitzer. The new one held his tongue, at least publicly. Whenever Spitzer's name came up during our conversations, Cuomo prefaced his remarks with, ''Let me say this off the record.''
IN ADDITION TO Spitzer's, there is, of course, another shadow looming over Cuomo's candidacy, and it's the same shadow that has loomed over him for most of his career. He rarely fails to mention Mario Cuomo during his campaign speeches, invariably to vigorous applause. For the most part, though, the former governor has been noticeably absent from the campaign. When Cuomo declared his candidacy behind the Tweed Courthouse, his father didn't mount the stage until the event was over and it was time to clap along to his campaign theme song, Bon Jovi's ''Work for the Working Man.'' Before the state convention, a member of Cuomo's camp suggested that his father serve as one of his nominators; Cuomo dismissed the idea. In fact, the father hasn't spoken at a single one of the son's campaign events.
You can't blame Cuomo for not wanting to follow one of the finest orators in modern political history or, for that matter, wanting to discourage the perception that his seemingly imminent election is really more of a coronation. (Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels who now hosts a talk-radio show in New York, has turned this notion into a form of performance art, crashing political events in a red king's hat and gown and a name tag identifying himself as King Cuomo II.) But neither would Cuomo want to be confused with his father, the unreconstructed, tax-and-spend liberal and eloquent spokesman for America's disenfranchised.
Mario Cuomo has always professed a degree of high-minded irritation with the feints and dodges of political campaigns. His attitude toward his son's appears to be no exception. Mario deliberately bypassed Andrew's campaign consultant, Phil Singer, when he phoned me directly to set up our interview. ''You'll probably need to call what's-his-name,'' he said, referring to Singer after we settled on a time and place. When I said I didn't think Singer needed to be there, the former governor laughed and said, ''You don't know these guys.'' At the end of our interview a couple of days later, the governor turned to Singer and playfully asked if there was anything he needed to deny or disavow.
The relationship between the two Cuomos is a source of endless fascination. Because father and son aren't often seen together, every interaction is scrutinized. After Andrew's speech at the state convention, New York Democrats were preoccupied with their brief, emotionally charged moment onstage together. ''Did you see Mario's reaction?'' one political operative who has known the Cuomo family for years asked me a few days later. ''Andrew kissed him, and Mario didn't kiss him back.''
It's no secret that Mario took a tough-love approach to fatherhood. ''My judgment about the Cuomos is that they are not a trusting family, but Mario did trust his son,'' says Norman Adler, who worked on Mario's 1982 gubernatorial campaign. ''He was also very hard on his son, sometimes extremely hard on him. Andrew was required to live up to a standard that I don't believe anybody else in the campaign had to live up to. I remember walking into his office and saying, 'I think you ought to lay off your son a little bit.' Mario would look up at me and say, 'What do you mean?' He didn't see it, but the rest of us did.''
Nearly 30 years later, the dynamic seems largely unchanged. After the convention, Mario criticized Andrew sharply for a line in his speech (a reference to Cuomo's claim that unspecified ''activist groups'' were plotting to turn the people of the state against one another), which the elder Cuomo felt was unnecessarily divisive.
Mario Cuomo still practices law at the Manhattan-based Willkie Farr & Gallagher. When I met him in his office, he was hunched over a computer -- an incongruous sight -- beneath a large photograph of the empty governor's office and a portrait of the Supreme Court justice Harry Blackmun. Cuomo told me that he just had a disturbing dream that his son won the election but quit before being sworn in because he couldn't face having to deal with the Legislature.
When the subject of his relationship with his son came up, Cuomo went into a philosophical disquisition on the strength of the family bond, its ability to withstand ''tsoris.'' For the most part, the former governor stayed on message during our conversation. As any protective parent would, he subtly outlined a counternarrative to the story of entitlement and opportunism told by Cuomo's critics. Mario dwelled on the role played by his own immigrant parents in his son's political education. Every now and then, though, a hint of mischief crept in, as when he offhandedly referred to his son's ''New NY Agenda'' book -- the source of much pride inside the campaign -- as a ''little pamphlet.'' Given how carefully Mario Cuomo chooses his words, it's hard to believe the slight wasn't intended.
As with many multigenerational political families, it's impossible to disentangle the Cuomos' personal relationship from their professional one. Andrew owes no small amount of his political success to his father. Mario lobbied Bill Clinton to get Andrew his first job at HUD and lined up a handful of key endorsements for him in the attorney general's race in 2006.
At the same time, Mario's towering presence has not made it easy for his son to establish his own political identity. Even now, Andrew is fighting a perception that took hold when he was working offstage for Mario that he's more enforcer than leader. Talk to Cuomo loyalists, and they will tell you that his ''real political DNA'' -- and this is a phrase that I heard more than once -- is to be found in his post-Mario years, when he created HELP and ran HUD. Implicit in this observation is that the story of Mario and Andrew Cuomo is as much a generational tale as a psychological one. Mario was an F.D.R. liberal (and child of immigrants) with an unyielding faith in the government's power to improve people's lives; Andrew is a product of the Nixon era, when that faith was tested and the government again had to prove its competence.
For those inclined to see politics through opera glasses, Cuomo's insistence on running against Pataki in 2002 was as much about his wanting to succeed where his father had failed as it was about his wanting to avenge his father's 1994 loss to Pataki. Similarly, you can see his campaign agenda as a different sort of Oedipal act: he is pledging to wreak some serious havoc on his father's legacy of big-government generosity.
For his part, Andrew Cuomo hates this sort of talk. He refers to the ceaseless parsing of his dynamic with his father as ''forced psychobabble'' and says that their relationship has always been ''much simpler and nicer than people made it out to be.''
New York's last two governors provide diametrically different case studies in the state government's famous resistance to reform. Spitzer, the self-described steamroller, took the bad-cop approach, effectively trying to bully the Legislature into submission. Paterson, a former state senator himself, tried reasoning with his former colleagues, to no better effect. Earlier this year, in the face of the state's mounting fiscal crisis, Paterson was unable to persuade a majority of legislators to significantly cut spending or pass seemingly innocuous revenue-generating bills, like a penny-an-ounce tax on soda. ''I felt like Chicken Little,'' Paterson told me recently, reflecting on his dynamics with the Legislature. ''Only at least people eventually listened to Chicken Little.''
With Bruno gone, Cuomo's primary nemesis -- the immovable object to his irresistible force -- is surely going to be the speaker of the State Assembly, Sheldon Silver, a shrewd political tactician who wields enormous power inside the statehouse. Assembly members cross Silver at their peril: he controls how much money flows to them, both for projects for their districts and, in many cases, for their re-election campaigns. He also doles out Assembly leadership positions, which come with cash bonuses known as ''lulus,'' and his handpicked allies become the chairmen of the key committees that determine which bills come to the floor. Silver, in other words, can pretty much single-handedly bring the workings of the New York State government to a standstill.
Cuomo's agenda is packed with items that the speaker is very likely to oppose, from his plan to have an independent commission draw the state's new electoral lines to his desire to strip the Legislature of its authority over the state agencies that Cuomo wants to consolidate. ''It's going to be a titanic struggle,'' one member of the Assembly told me.
The speaker is said to not like Cuomo: a prominent Democrat told me that he once heard Silver say that he has all of the faults of his father and none of his talents. (Silver denies ever having said this.) Silver is too canny to be drawn into battle with a popular political candidate. When I met with him recently one afternoon in Albany, he assured me, many times over, that if Cuomo is elected, they will ''find common ground.'' Few in Albany believe this. ''Shelly is a master of what we call the rope-a-dope strategy,'' someone who has worked closely with both Silver and Cuomo told me. ''His philosophy is that it's smarter to wait for an opponent to make a mistake than to force a fight. . . . That's what he did with Spitzer; he just sat back and let him punch himself silly, and I'm sure that's what he's going to do with Andrew. He's going to be very supportive publicly, defer to his agenda for the time being and then wait for his moment to strike.''
In Spitzer's case, that moment didn't take long. During his early weeks in Albany, he tried to push the Assembly to name a candidate he approved of to replace the resigning state comptroller, Alan Hevesi. Knowing that the state Constitution empowered the Legislature to fill the slot, Silver strung Spitzer along but eventually chose one of his own assemblymen, Tom DiNapoli, and marshalled the support for his appointment. Furious, Spitzer visited the districts of a number of assemblymen who supported DiNapoli and tried to publicly humiliate them, which only strengthened Silver's hand.
The question now is whether Cuomo is going to be another Spitzer or if he's going to take a different and perhaps more effective approach to dealing with Silver and the Legislature. Cuomo knows how Albany works, and no one doubts he's a shrewd political tactician himself. He is already maneuvering behind the scenes to weaken competing power centers in the government. He is investigating DiNapoli's office for selling access to the state's pension fund, quietly backing his own candidate to succeed him as attorney general and trying to bend lawmakers to his will by asking them, too, to sign his five-point pledge.
There are certainly reform-minded legislators who are sympathetic to Cuomo's agenda, but Albany is a complex, temperamental political organism. Changing it may require patience, flexibility and the willingness to accommodate. These are qualities that have not historically been associated with Andrew Cuomo. On the contrary, like Spitzer, Cuomo has a reputation for being something of a bully. At HUD, he struck an appreciably more adversarial posture toward the housing community than his predecessor, Henry Cisneros. ''Andrew wanted to make it clear that HUD was the big dog in housing in Washington and everybody else better respect that,'' says one veteran Washington housing expert.
When HUD's inspector general, Susan Gaffney, criticized some of Cuomo's management decisions, his office, according to a departmental-harassment claim she filed, started a smear campaign to destroy her credibility. ''The question isn't just has Andrew Cuomo learned the lessons of Eliot Spitzer?'' as one state assemblyman put it to me. ''It's also has he tamed his inner beast?''
Cuomo's rhetorical broadsides against Albany and his pointed efforts to rebrand the Democratic Party -- ''The New Democratic Party,'' read the signs at the state convention -- have already irked some lawmakers. By and large, they have scoffed at Cuomo's invitation to sign his pledge. Talking to members of the Legislature, you get the sense they're spoiling for a fight.
Earlier in the summer, I paid a visit to State Senator Ruben Diaz Sr., who represents the Bronx and happens to be close with Pedro Espada. At the time, the Legislature was warring with Governor Paterson over the budget, which was already a couple of months overdue. Diaz was threatening to vote against Paterson's temporary emergency budget, a move that could have shut down the government. ''I wish him luck,'' Diaz deadpanned when I mentioned some of Cuomo's reform proposals to him. ''We have been getting too many macho men in the government -- too many macho men,'' he continued, tilting back in his chair and working a wrist exerciser as he spoke.
It would be a mistake to assume that the unpopularity of the Legislature has softened its members' resolve. Individual lawmakers keep being re-elected, which so far has made them largely immune to criticism. They are preparing for a crusade of their own to beat back a hard-charging executive. ''We are expecting a thug,'' a senior Democrat told me when I asked about Cuomo. ''Have you seen the group of young men surrounding him -- men with dark suits, arms folded? That's what Albany thinks it's going to get: a bunch of tough guys trying to strong-arm people.''
As Cuomo sees it, he is trying to change the match-up: where Spitzer played one-on-one against the Legislature, he wants to bring voters into the game. With his victory seemingly assured, it's hard to gauge how much traction he's getting. He has the votes, but he needs more than that; he needs their fury, in weapons-grade form, pointed at Albany.
There is plenty of backroom discussion going on inside the Capitol about whether Cuomo might ultimately have to try to take control of the Legislature by starting a coup to depose Silver. For now anyway, he seems to be on a different tack, essentially bypassing Silver and trying to build pressure from the bottom up. ''Politicians are good listeners,'' he says. ''Because if they're not, they aren't politicians for very long.''
Cuomo told me that he's doing things the Washington way. President Clinton taught him that the best way to wrangle a bigger HUD budget from Congress was not to go up to Capitol Hill but to visit Congressional districts and persuade people to pressure their representatives.
Spitzer, ever the prosecutor, relished the role of combative crusader. Cuomo is casting himself as a very different sort of character. During our conversations about the Legislature, he repeatedly quoted a homespun homily -- ''You get more flies with honey than with vinegar'' -- from his grandfather Andrea, a grocer who came to America by boat from Southern Italy. ''Everybody is bracing for a confrontation,'' Cuomo told me. ''I don't believe there's going to be a confrontation. The Legislature doesn't want trouble. They want good news from a P.R. point of view. They need redemption. They need a friend. Eliot could have been their best friend. I think I can be their best friend.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Gates Makes a Start

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert Gates has pledged to restrain military spending. Predictably, members of Congress, industry lobbyists and military commanders are all pushing back. This is a battle well worth fighting. If anything, he needs to be even more ambitious.
The Pentagon's budget has doubled in the last decade to nearly $550 billion, not including the extra $159 billion this year to pay for two wars. There is no way to address the nation's deep fiscal crisis or its security threats without a more rational approach to defense procurement and tough choices on personnel policies.
Mr. Gates has already taken some sound preliminary steps. He has canceled or cut back several dozen unneeded weapons programs, a projected long-term savings of $330 billion, and ordered the military services and Pentagon agencies to find $100 billion in administrative cuts and efficiencies over the next five years. 
His latest proposed savings, outlined last week, are modest -- despite the political fire they are drawing. He is calling for closing the Joint Forces Command in Norfolk, Va. (it allocates forces around the world and encourages the services to work together on the battlefield). That could mean the loss of 2,800 jobs for military and civilian workers supported by 3,000 private contractors at an annual savings of $240 million. Mr. Gates also proposed a 30 percent cut over three years on contractors who provide support services to the military, placed a freeze on the number of workers in his office, and said he planned to eliminate at least 50 posts for generals and admirals and 150 for senior civilians, and shut down two Pentagon agencies that employ 550 more people.
Far more important, and politically difficult, is Mr. Gates's vow to rein in military health care spending: the annual bill rose from $19 billion to $50 billion over the last decade. Active-duty members of the military rightly do not pay for care. Annual premiums for retirees, $460 per family, have not risen in 15 years and must be increased.
A task force commissioned by Rep. Barney Frank and a bipartisan group of colleagues estimates that raising retiree premiums (it referenced an earlier study that talked about gradually increasing them to about $1,100 a family, still far below commercial rates), plus charging an enrollment fee for a program that provides a wraparound policy for Medicare-eligible retirees, could save $6 billion annually.
Mr. Gates, a savvy Washington insider, is trying to pre-empt even deeper cuts. He still wants to ensure an annual spending increase 1 percent over inflation for the foreseeable future. That is still too much.
He needs to jettison more poorly performing, redundant or anachronistic weapons systems, including nuclear weapons. Once the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down, the administration must look at trimming troop strength, beginning with the Navy and the Air Force.
Since the 9/11 attacks, Congress has given the Pentagon pretty much everything it has requested, with few questions asked. So it is good news that some members are now looking more critically at the Pentagon budget. In its recent report, Mr. Frank's task force -- the Sustainable Defense Task Force -- concluded that the Pentagon could cut $960 billion between 2011 and 2020 without harming essential security. The president's deficit commission must do the same. The military budget is 20 percent of federal spending and 50 percent of discretionary spending. There is no way to address the deficit without deeper cuts in defense spending.

HEADLINE: Nothing Boutique About It

BYLINE: By DWIGHT GARNER. 
DWIGHT GARNER is a book critic for The New York Times.

 BODY:
ON a humid summer afternoon, the Greenbrier looms out of the Allegheny Mountains, high above tiny White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., like an apparition -- a jumbo-size White House, a place that surely must be crawling with ghosts.
Once you're inside, that ghostly aura doesn't vanish. The Greenbrier is a time-machine throwback to earlier notions of luxury and leisure in America, from those of the antebellum South (Robert E. Lee was a regular guest) through the cold war jet-set era. Tea is still punctually served at 4:15 p.m. Jackets and ties are expected at dinner. There is a room devoted unironically -- the Greenbrier doesn't do irony -- to the composition, on stationery, of actual letters.
The place is so sprawling -- 682 rooms, 6,750 well-groomed acres -- that you can't help but think that this is where Stanley Kubrick, while making ''The Shining,'' should have filmed that eerie footage of Danny pedaling his tricycle down hallways filled with plush carpets and polished floors. The Greenbrier is made for long tracking shots. 
One of the best reasons to visit this grande dame of American resorts, founded in 1778, has always been to mingle with its plummy ghosts. Earliest guests included Andrew Jackson, Dolley Madison and Davy Crockett. Twenty-six American presidents, from James Monroe through George W. Bush, have spent time here. Joseph Kennedy honeymooned at the Greenbrier; so did Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. This is where the resort's longtime golf pro, Sam Snead, advised Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 to stick his backside out to improve his swing.
The Greenbrier has weirder, more complicated ghosts, too. During World War II it was an internment center, albeit an elegant one, for high-level Nazi and Japanese diplomats and their families. From the early 1960s through the early 1990s, when its existence was exposed, it was the site of a top-secret underground bunker, large enough to house every member of Congress in the event of nuclear war. The resort, about four hours from Washington, picked up a new nickname: Hotel Armageddon.
The hotel has seen four American centuries and survived plenty, but its hardest times may have arrived only recently. In 2000, the critics behind the Mobil Travel Guide snatched away the Greenbrier's longstanding five-star rating. A year later, 9/11 and its concomitant travel woes dealt another blow. In 2008, the resort announced a $38 million loss. In 2009, it declared bankruptcy.
Into this funk has stepped a local boy, and a potential white knight, named Jim Justice. Mr. Justice is a big (6 foot 7), loud, likeable man, the kind who punctuates his sentences with ''goshdarnit'' and is as well known for coaching the girl's basketball team at Greenbrier East High as he is for his diverse private company, which is worth an estimated $800 million. The son of a coal-mining entrepreneur, Mr. Justice, 59, bought the Greenbrier last year for $20 million from its longtime owner, the railroad company CSX, and he is laboring mightily to yank it into the 21st century.
He's got his work cut out for him. Younger travelers, used to boutique this and midcentury that, to monochrome interiors and clean lines, have been peeling off. That's something that's happening at a lot of historic hotels, said Bjorn Hanson, dean of the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, explaining that many people think that these old hotels lack certain modern amenities like Wi-Fi or coffee makers in rooms. ''These perceptions are usually wrong,'' he said, adding that a hotel like the Greenbrier also has an enormous cost structure to support, with massive payroll and grounds costs. That adds to the challenge.
Mr. Justice has obviously jumped in with both feet; his marks are everywhere. The Greenbrier has added a sleek, leather-filled steakhouse called Prime 44 West, after the jersey number of the former N.B.A. great Jerry West, born in small-town Cheylan, W.Va. (Justice and West are old friends.) Suddenly there's an Asian fusion restaurant. Guests can play paintball, added a few years ago, in addition to visiting the resort's storied gun club.
This summer the Greenbrier got a PGA Tour stop, as well, the Greenbrier Classic, during which the resort hosted concerts at the country fairgrounds by country music acts like Brad Paisley, Carrie Underwood and Rascal Flatts. Mr. Justice likes wild cards. During the Greenbrier Classic, he offered $1 million to any player who hit a hole-in-one on the par-3 18th hole. (No one did.) Spectators who witnessed the hole-in-one would each get $100.
His biggest wild card is the addition, earlier this summer, of a 40,000-square-foot casino. The place is picking up a hum. It's also picking up some cognitive dissonance. A casino at the Greenbrier? That's like learning Barbara Bush has decided to get a tattoo on her lower back. Mr. Justice had no choice, he said, but to shake things up. He admitted, in one interview, that the Greenbrier had ''dissolved into a really elegant retirement home.''
LAST month, to get a sense of how the Greenbrier is balancing its dignity and old-world mien with roulette tables and fusion cuisine, I spent four days there with my family -- my wife, Cree, and our children, Penn, 12, and Harriet, 11 -- and a friend. For me, it was a homecoming of sorts. I was born in Fairmont, W.Va., about three hours north of White Sulphur Springs, and the Greenbrier loomed large in my childhood imagination.
The resort is this struggling state's mansion on the hill, a beacon of native pride. Actress Jennifer Garner -- she is, alas, no relation -- spoke for many in the state when she intoned about the Greenbrier at the casino's opening: ''I'm just going to burst with pride that my home state has something this beautiful to offer.'' Ms. Garner was raised in West Virginia.
That pride, for many West Virginians, is mixed with a dash of resentment. In a state where the median income is $38,000 a year, the Greenbrier is a place most residents will never spend a night. (Rooms begin at $249 a night, and go much higher.)
The good news about the Greenbrier, under Mr. Justice's direction, is that it has an alert, friendly, purposeful air. Our kids, marveling at the exploring it is possible to do in this cavernous and sprawling place, essentially vanished for three days. They took falconry lessons, and tutorials at the resort's 55-foot climbing tower.
They spent hours at the Greenbrier's eight-lane bowling alley, in its indoor and outdoor pools, and visiting its 300-seat movie theater, the size of an airplane hanger, that shows recently released films free every night. When we picked them up after a showing of ''Avatar'' one evening, I scanned the crowd, and it occurred to me that the words of a Wall Street Journal reporter, written in the 1930s, amazingly, still hold true: ''The percentage of people who attend movies in evening dress is greater at White Sulphur than any place in this or any other country.''
While the children were off, drunk on their good fortune, we were nearly as busy. It's possible to gawk for hours at the Greenbrier's color-splashed interiors, the work of the society designer Dorothy Draper in the mid-1940s. Nothing seems to match, and that's the point. The result is something Lily Pulitzer and Laura Ashley might have dreamed up together after following Alice down the rabbit hole. Hiking the Greenbrier's rolling, manicured grounds is nearly as consuming. The casual celebrity-watching is a bonus. (Is that really Itzhak Perlman in shorts, eating lunch by the pool? It is!)
While Cree had a pedicure at the Greenbrier's 40,000-square-foot spa and dawdled by the pool with a pile of books and magazines, my friend and I spent an afternoon shooting sporting clays at the resort's gun club. We spent another afternoon taking a tour of the Strangelovian underground bunker. Our guide made it clear that there's still some resentment here, nearly 20 later, toward Ted Gup, the reporter who first disclosed the bunker's existence in a 1992 Washington Post Magazine article.
None of us care about golf, and we didn't stride the Greenbrier's four championship courses. (In 2009, Golf Digest called the Greenbrier the No. 8 best golf resort in North America.) Nor did we enlist in the off-road driving school or go horseback riding. But we did take a galvanizing daylong whitewater rafting trip in the remote Lower New River Gorge, about an hour and a half away, operated by a superb outfit called Class VI. (We saved a few hundred dollars by booking the trip directly with Class VI and driving there ourselves instead of using the Greenbrier's transportation.)
And my son and I played an adrenalized few hours of paintball with other resort guests in a cleared section of some nearby woods, a place much more appealing than the prefabricated paintball courses one sees elsewhere. Neither of us had played before, and we quickly learned a lesson: getting hit by a paintball pellet hurts. The first time I got it, in the knuckles, I began to curse and jump around, only to expose myself to further withering enemy fire.
Then there was the casino, a place Mr. Justice has pretty accurately described as ''Monte Carlo meets 'Gone With the Wind.' '' It's tucked away on a lower floor, where it doesn't clash with the hotel's antiquated feel. This isn't Atlantic City. Every night at 10, play stops as dancers whirl down a marble staircase to a song called ''The Greenbrier Waltz.'' Then there is a Champagne toast to the guests' health.
The Greenbrier's casino is open only to overnight guests and other Greenbrier members, however, and it was largely empty on the two midweek nights we were there. The slot machines were a blinking ghost town, and most of the guests flocked to the less expensive blackjack tables ($10 and $15 minimum bets) while the big-shot tables were wide open. It's hard to imagine this place, as currently configured, helping to keep the Greenbrier afloat.
Mr. Justice says he isn't worried. ''The casino isn't supposed to be the economic engine of the Greenbrier,'' he said. ''That wasn't the idea. It's just a great amenity, a way to bring in some new energy.'' But he does want the Greenbrier to turn a profit, and soon. ''I'm not the kind of guy who has an ambition to pile up gold and sit around and stir the pot,'' he said. ''But profitability is important to me. It's one of the definitions of success, and it sustains longevity and passion and enthusiasm. Without it, you can get worn down.''
The bad news about the Greenbrier is that Mr. Justice still has work to do. With its grand chandeliers and flowing staircases, in addition to Dorothy Draper's decor, this place will never be hip. But it doesn't have to feel quite as dated as it does.
You arrive at the Greenbrier expecting the grand resort cliches: the generic food, the hidden fees, the Muzak. They're all here. And you anticipate that moment -- it always comes at resorts, as it does on cruise ships and other shrink-wrapped environments -- when you scream: Get me out of here! That moment arrives.
But my sense of awe at this hotel never went away.
The Greenbrier is famous for its service, and funny stories about it abound. In the 1960s, Hubert Humphrey, then vice president, spent a day turkey shooting there without hitting his mark. A quick-thinking staff member found an especially slow-moving turkey at a nearby farm and placed it directly in Humphrey's path. It took Humphrey three shots, but he finally nailed it.
The Greenbrier remains the kind of place that will go far out of its way to make you happy. Its bustling concierge station could probably turn up Osama bin Laden for you, if you asked nicely.
These days, however, that service is often world-class but sometimes distracted. You may be given three big, warm hellos when you walk into one of the Greenbrier's restaurants, and then be left to wait 10 minutes before a waiter arrives to take your drink order, even if the place is empty.
The food is another puzzlement. It's closer to the continental cuisine of the '70s and '80s than anything happening in serious restaurants today. It's making many of the right moves, growing much of its produce at its own 40-acre organic farm. But those fresh flavors don't always make their way to tables.
The best option these days is Prime 44 West, where the aged steaks are expensive beauties, and grilled to perfection. But what kind of steakhouse doesn't serve creamed spinach?
A good chunk of the Greenbrier's business has long come from corporate junkets, which makes a kind of sense. For most of humanity, this is the kind of place that is best enjoyed when someone else is paying. Without trying very hard, we managed to drop more than $4,000 in four days.
When I lost my bathing suit, the cheapest one I could find in the shops that line the hallways of the Greenbrier's lower floor was $75. (I elected to swim in my baggy shorts.) Oh, and that cute little bowling alley? My children, playing an hour or two a day, ran up a bill of more than $230.
Places like the Greenbrier -- and there is only a handful these rambling places, most of them built later, at the turn of the last century -- simply may never be affordable for everyone, at least for extended stays. But they're worth the effort.
As Greg Coble, senior vice president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, told me: ''The Greenbrier is the kind of place you simply can't find elsewhere. If it were gone, it couldn't be reproduced. It's not cookie cutter, it's filled with eccentricities. It occupies a special place in this country's history.''
My wife tired of the Greenbrier before I did. For her, one night would have been ideal. After three days, she began to refer to our stay, quoting the title of a David Foster Wallace essay about being trapped on a cruise ship, as ''A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again.''
The kids and I had a ball, however, and we're already making plans to sneak back, if only to find out how Jim Justice's excellent adventure is coming along.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, the cover article on Aug. 15 about the Greenbrier in West Virginia misstated the telephone number for the resort. It is (800) 453-4858. The article also misidentified the birthplace of the actress Jennifer Garner. While Ms. Garner was raised in West Virginia, she was born in Houston. (She was referring to West Virginia when she commented on the Greenbrier, noting how proud she was that ''my home state has something this beautiful to offer.'')

HEADLINE: The Tax Cut We Can Afford

BYLINE: By MARK ZANDI. 
Mark Zandi is the chief economist of Moody's Analytics.

 BODY:
UNLESS Congress and President Obama act soon, Americans' taxes will increase in 2011, when the cuts enacted under President George W. Bush are due to expire. Almost everyone agrees that this makes little sense given the economy's fragility. But consensus ends there. The president supports permanently extending the current tax rates for all except the highest-income households, while Congressional Republicans want the entire basket of cuts to be made permanent. The prudent middle ground would be to forestall any tax increases in 2011 and to phase in higher rates on upper-income households in 2012, when the economy will be on firmer ground.
The president's plan would be taking an unnecessary gamble with the struggling recovery. Businesses have only recently begun to add jobs, and they appear to be a long way from hiring fast enough to reduce unemployment. Even under the best of circumstances, the unemployment rate will remain near 10 percent well into next year. The high rate of joblessness has cast a shadow on the collective psyche that will only worsen with higher taxes, raising the already uncomfortably high odds that the economy will suffer a double-dip recession. 
In most times, raising taxes on the wealthy by such a modest amount has had little impact on the economy. But these aren't most times. The well-to-do appear unusually sensitive to changes in their finances, probably because their nest eggs are significantly smaller with the drop in stock and housing prices. Only the top 3 percent of households would have to pay higher taxes if the president got his way, but this rarefied group currently accounts for a fourth of consumer spending. If they pull back, even a bit, the recovery could be derailed.
Successful small-business owners, who power the nation's job-creation machinery, make up one-third of these high-income taxpayers. They have set up their businesses so that their profits are taxed at personal rates. Raising marginal tax rates, even a little, on those who have suffered during the past several years would be a mistake.
Some people make a more nuanced argument that higher taxes on the wealthy could pay for additional economic stimulus -- like a bigger job tax credit or resurrected 1930s-style work programs. This view has theoretical merit -- some of my own analysis has been used to support it -- but it is asking too much of our political system now to get it just right. I'm skeptical that a politicized Congress would be able to pull it off, and failure to do so would leave us next year with higher taxes and a hobbled recovery.
On the other hand, the Republican proposal to keep the current tax rates permanently in place even for the wealthy takes an unnecessary gamble with our long-term fiscal outlook. Tax cuts do not pay for themselves. Even when President Ronald Reagan slashed much higher tax rates in half, this argument failed; in the current tax debate, it is unsupportable. By definition, high-income households are where the money is; higher rates would raise substantial revenue for long-term deficit reduction.
Once the recovery is off and running, and stock and housing prices are consistently rising, allowing the Bush tax cuts for high-income households to expire -- over, say, a three-year period -- would not harm the economy. The overwhelming fear among high earners that their lifestyles will be forever diminished should have faded, and the tax increases would be small enough not to materially alter wealthy people's decisions about spending, working or investing.
Keep in mind that the economy performed admirably in the 1990s when high-income households paid the same higher tax rates. And the wealthy would benefit as much as anyone from reducing the federal deficit, because that would keep interest rates low, spurring investment and job creation.
Whatever policymakers decide regarding the tax code, they should take action, or agree not to, quickly. Not knowing what tax rates will be just a few months from now is adding to the collective nervousness, already high after the epic policy debates on health care, financial regulation, energy and immigration. All this anxiety is most likely affecting whether businesses hire.
None of this means the tax code should be off the table when President Obama's fiscal commission addresses how to fix our long-term problems. Past experience with fiscal austerity at home and overseas strongly suggests that it is best for the economy's long-run performance to restrain government spending rather than raise taxes, but taxes must also be part of our national debate.
In this recession, the government has necessarily made a string of momentous economic policy decisions. Some have worked well; others have been a disaster. We can't afford any more mistakes.

HEADLINE: My Kind of Technocracy

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
James Warren, a former managing editor of the Chicago Tribune, is a columnist and editor for the Chicago News Cooperative.

 BODY:
Chicago
DAN ROSTENKOWSKI, a gin and porterhouse kind of guy, surely would have felt out of place at the Chicago restaurant where President Obama celebrated his 49th birthday the other day.
Mr. Obama went to the celebrity chef Graham Elliot Bowles's eponymous new joint, which has featured risotto with green apple, Wisconsin cheddar and Nueske bacon, and foie gras dusted with Pop Rocks. It's one of many dining spots that make this city a destination for foodies, with the now-defunct Gourmet magazine tagging one, Alinea, as America's best.
Who knew? 
The disjunction between the city's national image and reality was underscored by homages to Mr. Rostenkowski, the longtime Congressional titan who died last week at age 82. He was recalled as a tough, master dealmaker without a college education who brought home the pork and used his link to the city's Democratic machine to create an imposing don't-mess-with-me aura.
It played to an overriding caricature of Chicago: bad winters, Al Capone, slimy politics, the lovable loser Cubs. It can be found in the lame narrative advanced by critics of Mr. Obama and his top aides, which portrays them as products of a nefarious, indigenous ''Chicago way'' of politics in which backstabbing is a fine art.
Lost in the Rostenkowski coverage was this: He came from a very different Chicago than that of Mr. Obama, whose Harvard pedigree, sophistication, itinerant past and cerebral cool are far more in sync with the reality of this new, little-understood city.
The Chicago of Mr. Rostenkowski, whose funeral will be in the same Polish Catholic church his grandmother attended, served its residents well. But it is Mr. Obama's Chicago that carries aspirations for a bright postindustrial future and is a far cry from any gray, somber metropolis with howling winds and barroom loudmouths arguing about ''Da Bears.''
The old Chicago was largely the handiwork of Mr. Rostenkowski's political patron, the iconic Mayor Richard J. Daley. Daley's legacy is largely concrete-filled, including the grimly austere University of Illinois at Chicago, the big expressways, O'Hare International Airport, scores of well-intentioned but now-discarded public housing projects and the Loop's inspiring skyscrapers.
From his perch on the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rostenkowski fed the steel and concrete beast with federal largess. Long past his patron's death in 1976, he kept the booty coming, via dollars and tax breaks. You can point to the stadium where the White Sox play, a second airport, the mile-long Navy Pier, subways, trains and far more -- and find the hand of a truly effective power broker.
Coincidentally, much of the transformation of the city followed Mr. Rostenkowski's departure from public office after a 1994 criminal indictment and an election defeat. Under his patron's son, Mayor Richard M. Daley, the city began replacing a dying industrial economy with one built on information. Its exchanges now trade in foreign currencies, insurance risks and other complex uncertainties, not just soybeans, wheat and corn. Not even most Chicagoans understand the vivid symbolism of how the Sears Tower is now the Willis Tower, while the Standard Oil Building, the city's fourth tallest, is Aon Center. Aon and Willis are the world's largest and third-largest reinsurers.
THERE remains too much grinding poverty, too much violence and too many pols like Rod R. Blagojevich, the impeached former governor of Illinois. Still, the state has less public corruption than Florida, at least according to the Justice Department. And Saskia Sassen of Columbia University, an expert in the rise of so-called global cities, ranks Chicago as the fifth most important one economically, after New York, London, Tokyo and Singapore.
As someone who has lived here since the late 1970s, I find it pretty easy to see the change. All you have to do is walk through Millennium Park, a 24.5-acre downtown space mixing sculpture, architecture (Renzo Piano, Frank Gehry) and a video-adorned fountain. It's by far the most democratic space in what remains the most segregated Northern city.
Or take in the remade lakefront, the Lazarus-like downtown (with more high-rises built since 1998 than exist in total in Detroit, St. Louis or Milwaukee), the revival of community through a vast expansion of public libraries. There's also, of course, the elevation to the White House of a Chicagoan and some shrewd and sophisticated former Richard M. Daley associates, notably David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett, senior advisers, and Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff.
For sure, one cannot separate Mr. Rostenkowski from his Capitol Hill legacy. ''There won't be one like him again. He was a master of a system that's been blown apart,'' said Jim McDermott, an 11-term Democratic representative from Seattle and a Chicago native who served with Mr. Rostenkowski on Ways and Means.
Mr. McDermott joked about some loud sweaters -- ''they're not chichi San Francisco colors'' -- he retains as mementos from the weekend retreats Mr. Rostenkowski held for the entire Ways and Means Committee, Democrats and Republicans, whom he sought to fashion into a self-perceived elite. They listened to academics and other experts, talked shop and did heavy socializing. Broaching such a gathering these days is a nonstarter.
The concept of working together is by and large gone, Mr. McDermott argued, first blaming Republicans under Newt Gingrich for their mid-1990s-inspired partisanship, then conceding that Democrats ''acted just like the Republicans'' when they took over.
But there's another Rostenkowski legacy, perhaps now echoed by Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Rostenkowski acolyte who stepped down as Ways and Means chairman to fight accusations of ethical violations. Too much power infused both men with a sense of entitlement. Each looked like a deer in the headlights when charges of misdeeds were leveled.
Change can be swift, even if not fully appreciated. It happens with individual politicians, and great cities, too.

HEADLINE: Finding a Bridge Over the Void

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI. 
E-mail: thesearch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THEY'RE known as the 99ers -- laid-off people who have gone 99 weeks without finding work, at which point their jobless benefits expire. More than 1.4 million Americans have been unemployed for at least that long -- victims of an economy that has not been creating many jobs.
Lawmakers are debating whether to extend unemployment benefits, subsidize more job training or approve huge public works projects like the ones of the Great Depression. But as the political issues are debated, many people have seen their already-minimal benefits disappear, and others will hit the 99-week barrier soon. What can they do? 
The economic and psychological effects of long-term joblessness can be devastating -- making it that much harder to find a job. About.com, which is owned by The New York Times Company, has collected more than 2,000 firsthand stories from people who have been unable to find work.
They speak of feeling depressed and humiliated, of feeling that they are considered ''lazy'' by those who have jobs. Some describe losing their homes and being forced to move in with family members. They write of their savings running out, using up retirement money, selling their belongings and waiting for their cellphone service to be cut off or their cars to be repossessed.
There comes a time when sheer survival trumps career aspirations, and facing that can be hard. Sometimes you can pay your bills while adding a few lines to your resume, but at other times that simply isn't possible.
The trick to facing long-term unemployment is to ''find the intersection between your highest-paying skill and market demand,'' said Nancy Collamer, founder of the Layoff Survival Guide, a Web site.
One way to do this is to offer your services on a temporary basis, Ms. Collamer said. If you are an out-of-work lawyer, for example, offer to perform research or title searches.
Check with temp agencies or talk to friends who own businesses and ask if they have project-oriented work available, Ms. Collamer said. Send out an e-mail blast on a social networking site, saying you are available to help with specific services, she advised.
Don't appear desperate or mention your personal financial situation when seeking temporary work, she said: ''It's all about selling a value proposition.''
Sometimes, she said, ''your best bet may be to turn to something outside your professional expertise.''
Take a look at the needs of your community. Those could include services like dog walking, child care, house sitting or driving people to their appointments.
Some unemployed people are thinking too narrowly, said Ford R. Myers, a career coach, author and president of Career Potential in Philadelphia.
''They're looking at jobs that only match up with the job they had before,'' Mr. Myers observed. But even in the best of times, he said, this is not how the work world operates.
He recommends a ''bridge job strategy -- it's a way to tide yourself over until you can land back on your feet at an appropriate level.''
Like Ms. Collamer, he suggests exploring temporary jobs, along with home-based and part-time jobs. Consider administrative support work, or some kind of manual labor, he said. ''It's not great money,'' he said, ''but it keeps you busy and it pays some bills and it carries you over.''
If you were previously a bank executive and happen to own a van, you don't tend to think, ''Maybe I'll do some moving and hauling,'' but that could be a temporary solution, he said.
It's important to set up ''a mental separation between the real job and the bridge job,'' Mr. Myers said. ''We have to get rid of this sense of false pride,'' he observed, adding that it's no time to say, ''I'm not going to take a job like that -- I'm an executive.''
During a long-term job search, Ms. Collamer said, make sure that you receive emotional support and maintain social connections. She recommends joining a job support group, but ''you don't want to be joining a pity party; it's got to be a proactive group.'' Volunteering can also keep you outside your own head -- and can lead to job opportunities.
GUARD against self-defeating thoughts, said Alison Doyle, a job search specialist for About.com. Remember that because of the economy, many capable and qualified people are unable to get jobs right now, even though they are doing all the right things, she said.
And don't be afraid to ask for help. If your jobless benefits have run out, other government or community programs may be able to offer assistance, especially if you have children, she said.
''You may feel too proud to take assistance,'' Ms. Doyle said, ''but if there is assistance out there you should take it'' -- whether from government or community programs, family or friends.

HEADLINE: It's Still the Year of the Outsider

BYLINE: By WHIT AYRES. 
Whit Ayres is a Republican pollster.

 BODY:
Alexandria, Va.
CONVENTIONAL wisdom holds that Tuesday's primary election results offered a ray of hope to reeling Democrats. The prevailing narrative is that by nominating several candidates who are ''out of the mainstream,'' Republicans have undercut their ability to win contested races in the fall.
But the forces that produced those outsider candidates are precisely the forces that have placed Democrats in peril this election cycle. Disgust with Washington and its overspending, deficits and debt is so great that even nontraditional Republican candidates have real chances to win. 
In Colorado's Senate race, the establishment Democratic candidate, Michael Bennet, got his party's nomination, while the establishment Republican candidate, the former Lt. Gov. Jane Norton, lost to Ken Buck, a little-known county prosecutor. In an anti-establishment, anti-incumbent, anti-Washington year, pitting an incumbent senator who voted for the auto bailout, the stimulus bill and President Obama's health care reform against an insurgent Republican with little connection to Washington is not exactly a dream matchup for the Democrats.
Indeed, it will be extremely difficult for Democrats to use their ''failed policies of the George W. Bush administration'' strategy against Republican Senate candidates who were nowhere near Washington during the Bush years. These include Mr. Buck, Sharron Angle in Nevada, Carly Fiorina in California, Linda E. McMahon in Connecticut and Rand Paul in Kentucky.
The 2010 election will almost certainly be a referendum on Democratic governance, and people are not happy with it. Almost twice as many voters think the country is on ''the wrong track'' as think it is going in the ''right direction,'' according to Pollster.com's average of recent polls. According to Pollster, Americans disapprove of the job the Democratic-controlled Congress is doing, by 70 percent to 18 percent, and a majority disapprove of the president's overall performance. (True, the Republican Party isn't popular either, but that disaffection is likely to have less drag on outsider candidates.)
Moreover, there is little the Democrats can do to change their standing in the eyes of the most important voters, those who don't identify with either party. Last month, my firm, Ayres, McHenry & Associates, asked 1,000 likely voters to choose between two statements on a survey for the Republican National Committee:
Having a president and Congress controlled by the Democrats allows the country to keep moving forward. This election is a choice between continued progress and going back to the failed policies of the Bush administration.
Having a president and Congress controlled by the Democrats has not worked well for the country. From the economy to the deficit and the debt, the Democrats have not gotten the job done.
It was no surprise that Democratic voters preferred the first statement and Republican voters the second. But self-identified independents preferred the second statement by 53 percent to 38 percent, and there is no doubt that independents will determine the balance of power in November's election.
We also found that independents in particular are suspicious of one-party control of government. Another question from our survey offered these two choices:
We need Democrats to keep control of Congress so our government can overcome Republican obstruction and continue making progress on jobs, health care and holding Wall Street accountable.
We need more Republicans in Congress to act as a check and balance on runaway Washington government that is bankrupting the country and mortgaging our children's future.
By 57 to 36 percent, independents said they wanted more Republicans to act as a check and balance on Democratic governance.
The country is simply fed up with Democratic spending. In mid-July, I directed a survey for Resurgent Republic, a nonprofit advocacy group I founded with Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. For 1,000 likely voters in the dozen states with tossup Senate races, we offered this choice:
We need more tax revenue as well as spending cuts to reduce the federal deficit. We will never get the deficit under control unless we make the difficult but necessary decision to raise taxes.
Our federal deficit is a result of too much spending in Washington, not too little tax revenue. Instead of raising taxes on anyone, Congress should make the difficult but necessary decisions to get spending under control.
By 73 to 24 percent, likely voters in these tossup states said the federal deficit was a spending rather than a revenue problem. Independents agreed with the overall electorate by 75 to 21 percent. Even Democrats agreed that the deficit is driven by spending, by 55 to 41 percent.
In off-year elections like 2010's, voter engagement is particularly important, and all indicators point to Republican enthusiasm and Democratic disenchantment. In our polling for the Republican National Committee, we asked voters to indicate their interest in the Congressional election on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being ''extremely interested.'' Fifty-three percent of Republican voters and 43 percent of independents said their interest was a 10, compared with only 35 percent of Democrats.
Nor is support from the Tea Party movement the negative influence that Democrats keep insisting it is. Although Republicans view the movement favorably and Democrats view it unfavorably, in our polling a majority of independents give the Tea Party movement a favorable rating, 51 to 34 percent.
There is always the chance that the neophyte Republican candidates will make major mistakes or run incompetent campaigns. But absent that, the larger forces driving this election are certain to bolster Republican fortunes in November.

HEADLINE: Team Insights? Just Use Your Peripheral Vision

 BODY:
This interview with George S. Barrett, chairman and chief executive of Cardinal Health, a health care services company, was conducted and condensed byAdam Bryant.
Q.Talk about some important leadership lessons for you.
A. I had an injury going into my senior year of high school that required major surgery, and it caused me to miss my senior soccer season. Almost every college recruiter dropped off the map. Sports had been at the center of my life, and this was my first big setback. It was a real test of my resilience. I recovered and went on to play college soccer, but a reinjury during my junior season in college ended my athletic career.
I was sort of bitter for a while, which is not really in my nature. I think I blamed my coach for a lot of things, when in fact this was really about me and my injury. I had to deal with it, and I had to move on.
I came out of it with a different perspective, and I discovered that I had other talents that maybe I could dig more deeply into. I was able to explore my passion for music, which actually led me to pursue a professional music career for a while. So I found that there was another side of me. 
Q. What about leadership lessons in business?
A. I was running a company that was acquired by a bigger firm. I stayed with them after the acquisition, and then I got a call from the chairman and he said: ''We're having some issues with our flagship company. Would you be willing to come in and run it?'' I was 34 years old, and I said to myself: ''Well, it's already struggling. How badly could I mess it up?'' So I went there.
Everyone on the management team was in their 50s, so the first day I was introduced to them, I thought they were going to collapse. You could sort of see them thinking, ''That kid?''
I realized I was going to have to win these guys over pretty quickly. I also knew that there were some folks in that group who were probably not going to come along for the ride. It was a turnaround, so I knew that I was going to have to move quickly to fix some things.
Q.So how did you handle that transition?
A. I was very clear and direct about what I thought we were facing and what we needed to do about it, without blame. I had to create an environment in which people knew it was their job to tell me things that we needed to do because we were going to run out of time. I tend to be very direct. I expect people to be that way with me.
Q. How did you assess the existing management team?
A. I concluded fairly quickly that not many of them would be staying. I'll tell you one specific story. We were having some pretty significant compliance issues. So I spent some time looking through all this data and working with one executive who had responsibility for this key area.
About three months into it, I sat him down, and I said, ''Look, I think it's probably time for us to part ways.'' I said: ''You haven't disagreed with me once. You haven't challenged me, nor have you really been comfortable bringing me bad news, and that's what I need.''
There were some very capable people there, but I just think the employees had lost confidence in them. That's very hard to recover, because so much of leadership is about trust and belief. People have to believe in you. And when they stop believing in you, you can say all the things in the world, but it's very, very hard to mobilize an organization when they've lost that belief.
Q. How long did it take to size up whether someone was staying on the team?
A. It was about watching them, and watching the organization respond to them. I'll give you an example. We're sitting with a large group of folks, about 40 to 50 managers, and people are standing up to raise certain issues.
And I watched this one executive. People were watching and riveted to him, really listening and engaged. And then this other executive spoke, and I watched him address the group, and I watched everyone's eyes. And their eyes went back down to their tables. They couldn't even meet eyes with him. It was a clear signal that said, ''You've lost us.''
So sometimes you don't know what the messages are that you're going to get, but you have to look for them. They come from your peripheral vision. And that was one of those cases where I just knew it the second it happened.
Q.Any surprises in the top job?
A. I think later on in my career there were. As you take on leadership roles of larger organizations with higher profiles, there are things that come with that that you're not always ready for -- realizing that every word that you say means something. If you use the word ''may'' instead of ''might,'' people think, ''Well, were you telling us something?'' So there was this sudden awareness of the need to be clear and careful about every symbol.
When you're younger, and when you're leading a smaller group or organization, it's really more about the actions. You touch everything directly. You communicate with everybody directly. As you get into leading a bigger organization, you can't touch everything directly, and so what you do carries symbolic weight. Often that's the power of words, but sometimes it's other things.
Q.Like what?
A. Well, it's often the little stuff. My days are jammed, like any other person who does what I do. It takes a lot of time for me to actually go over to the building where our cafeteria is and eat there, but I try to go there often just to see people. I get a chance to talk to people who actually are doing the work every day and that I rarely get to see.
So little symbols like that matter. What do you spend your money on? When you first arrive into your position, do you spend a lot of money on new office furniture? These things seem trivial. Economically, they may not be important, but they are symbols.
Q.Talk about how you hire.
A. By the time a person sees me, they've been screened for technical competence. So I'm really looking for fit. I think every organization has its own unique footprint and brand. Cardinal Health's organization really values humility. They don't want people coming in and telling them how to do things and showing off. They want folks who they really enjoy being around, who demonstrate a competence in a more modest and humble way. So you have to know your organization.
Q.What questions do you ask?
A. I ask questions to try to get at a person's nature. What are they really all about? Not just, what were their experiences, but how do they think? How do they operate? How do they lead? How do they interact? How do they deal with adversity? I try to look at how those pieces will fit together, and then I try to find someone I want to be around.
You know, we work incredibly hard. It's nice to be with people you want to work with. That doesn't mean, by the way, you have to be going out to dinner every night or that they're going to be your best friend. But it has to be someone you have a fundamental connection to in some way, and you trust them.
I really encourage them to ask questions. What they're curious about tells you a lot about who they are, and that's sort of the most fun part of the interview for me. And it also tells you a little bit about what they're interested in. It probably tells you how well they understand your company. And it tells you a little bit about their comfort with you. Are they really willing to ask a hard question?
Q.What would you say to a new senior executive you've just hired who asks, ''What's it like to work for you?''
A. I'm going to trust you to do your work. I expect you to be unbelievably committed. That doesn't mean that if you've got a kid who's got a softball game at 3 p.m. you don't run to it, because that's really important. That's a part of life.
I also let them know that I'm very direct. You have to be comfortable with very direct feedback. I'm going to be very engaged. I'm going to probe and prod. It's like a Socratic method with me. I'm going to continue to push on you. It's part of the way I function. It's part of the way I get information and I get understanding, and it's also the way that you'll share your thoughts with me.
I count on you to set high goals, and I expect you to be incredibly direct with me. I'm not much of a micromanager, but if I am not confident we're going the right direction I'll be very engaged with you. I like to have fun in my work, and I expect it's O.K. for you to do the same. And we work really hard, and we have a really good time together.
Q. What about career advice?
A. Find the environment in which you thrive. You can put a great plant in the wrong soil and it's not going to grow, and it's true for all of us.
Q. What's your philosophy of leadership?
A. Articulating it in a single sound bite is hard for me, but I'd say this. I do think leadership is largely about trust, and trust has a couple of dimensions. It starts with competence. People have to believe that you really know what you're doing. They have to really trust in your judgment because the data is so complex out there that they have to believe you can see through all the silliness and have some sense of the right course.
People have to trust that you have a point of view about what this enterprise is going to look like. What do we seek to be? And they have to trust that you understand them, that you get them. Not necessarily that you know them personally, but you understand what it's all about to work here and that you have their interests at heart. I think that when you can do those things, it can be a powerful combination.
I think people sometimes equate leadership with charisma and decisiveness. I think those are powerful tools, and I hope I have both, but they're not to be confused with leadership. I know a lot of very charismatic people who lack judgment and competence, and they're not great leaders. They're just fun to be around. And I know some very decisive people who lack judgment, which is terrifying.
Also, I think a leader has to be comfortable with having the weight on their shoulders. And that's not for everybody. It can be hard, and it's a different experience if you haven't had to experience this. That's not for everybody, but I like it because I don't feel like I'm alone. I wind up bringing the group together, and we own the weight. I love that part of it.
I also believe that leadership is a two-way street. I tell my team, ''I expect to learn from you as well as you'll learn from me.''

HEADLINE: Sweet Sounds Of Truce In Aspen

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
Aspen, Colo.
THE student singers at the Aspen Music Festival and School this summer rendered the finale of Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro'' touchingly: ''Pace, pace,'' Figaro and Susanna sang: ''Peace, peace.'' The repentant Count pleaded, ''Forgive me.'' The Countess responded, ''My answer is yes.''
It is one of the greatest, most moving reconciliation scenes in opera, conveying a lesson lost on the real-life characters of the festival high in the Rocky Mountains.
For more than a year bitter disputes involving the musicians, board members and management have festered, leading to a dizzying series of events at one of the nation's premier classical music festivals and training grounds. 
Aspen's president, Alan Fletcher, was ousted, reinstated and given a symbolic vote of no confidence. David Zinman, the festival's music director and a founder of its respected conducting institute, quit in anger. The board chairman was voted out.
Small groups of musicians and board members campaigned against Mr. Fletcher. Defenders arose, and others coalesced around one side or the other, bitterly dividing the faculty and trustees. Parties lawyered up and spent thousands of dollars in legal fees, adding $100,000 to a projected $250,000 deficit.
''It was literally uncomfortable to walk on the campus,'' said Yoheved Kaplinsky, a piano teacher at Aspen and the chairwoman of the piano department at the Juilliard School, who is an energetic Fletcher supporter. ''People were screaming at each other.''
The maneuverings over the last 18 months, set in motion by the dismissal of a group of faculty members, reveal several themes: how basic personality clashes can undermine institutions; and how downsizing can cause enormous strains, whether in an office, a factory or a cultural body, but especially in a close-knit musical oasis set in an Alpine playground of the rich, where egos can be fragile.
The hostilities also highlight the delicate relationship between money and the performing arts, between the payers and the players in classical music in America. Sometimes the people who provide the money -- trustees and patrons -- want more of a say in running things. Sometimes musicians resent the interference and, rightly or wrongly, think they know better.
The turmoil bubbled over into the opening of this season at a board meeting characterized by bickering and denunciations. Finally a frustrated board member and percussion teacher, Jonathan Haas, asked the trustees to stop and listen to the music coming through the windows.
''That is why we are here,'' he pleaded, according to the minutes.
Now, more than halfway through the festival's 62nd season, music seems to have regained the upper hand. While passions remain high, the fighting has stopped. In interviews during a recent three-day visit, people on all sides said they wanted to move on. A search committee is working to find a replacement for Mr. Zinman. And while some donors said they were withholding their dollars, festival management reports that overall giving has not suffered. ''All the measures of our health are good,'' Mr. Fletcher said.
A visitor ignorant of the recent history would have seen the festival in all its glory during the three days: the homey production of ''Figaro''; an offbeat orchestra program conducted by Robert Spano, featuring an appealing young soloist, the cellist Sol Gabetta; a chamber music concert with moving, dynamic performances of Brahms's Piano Trio No. 1 and Peter Maxwell Davies's anarchic ''Eight Songs for a Mad King''; a morning of opera scenes in the historic Wheeler Opera House that brought together young singers (including a standout 27-year-old South African soprano, Golda Schultz), conducting students, an orchestra and a completely involved audience.
While many nonprofit institutions suffer similar roilings, the events at Aspen draw particular scrutiny. The festival has been a rite of passage for generations of musicians, like the stars Renee Fleming, James Levine, Gil Shaham, Joshua Bell and Peter Schickele (of P. D. Q. Bach fame), and also countless orchestra players.
The students, mostly college age, gather for two months of performances, master classes and lessons. They play in orchestras, often sitting next to their teachers. Numerous alumni become faculty members, and many return year after year. One look at Aspen's gorgeous setting provides an easy explanation.
A root of the conflict lies in Aspen's distinctive governing structure. The 11 members of the elected musicians' committee automatically sit on the board, which can have up to 50 members. In addition, a larger corporation dominated by the entire music faculty also has a say in festival affairs. So the musicians enjoy more power at Aspen than at most classical music organizations. Twice in recent decades they flexed their muscles, vetoing a new president just before he was to be announced and helping to force out Mr. Fletcher's immediate predecessor, Don Roth.
After Mr. Fletcher joined the organization, in March 2006, the board gave him a major task: helping to rewrite the bylaws in a way that would effectively reduce the corporation's (that is, the musicians') power, a move that his supporters point out was approved by the corporation. Yet resentment among the musicians lingers.
After the change Aspen received its largest pledge ever, $25 million over the long term from Matthew and Kay Bucksbaum for a campus renovation.
For years, contention among the administration, board and faculty was kept at bay under the leadership of Robert Harth, a beloved figure who left in 2001 to become president of Carnegie Hall. Some say Aspen never got over his departure.
Mr. Fletcher, 53, a son of a missionary and academic father and a church musician mother, is a composer and longtime administrator, first at the New England Conservatory, where he rose to become provost, then as head of the Carnegie Mellon School of Music.
All agree on Mr. Fletcher's deep musical knowledge and intelligence. With a reserved, intellectual manner, he is cool yet engaging in conversation. Mr. Fletcher's demeanor has repeatedly been cited as a problem by his critics.
He started out well. A performance evaluation called his first year remarkable, adding the caveat that he should mix more with members of the staff and faculty. Early on, hard-nosed practices pushed by businessmen on the board confronted Mr. Fletcher. He was asked to sign off on a management-by-objective process that set measurable goals, and he did so.
With the reduced power of the faculty as backdrop, Mr. Fletcher moved to put into place a board-backed strategic plan to shrink the festival, cutting it to eight weeks from nine, reducing the student body to 625 from 750 and dismissing 16 faculty members. The initial goal was to improve the experience of the students, who numbered as many as 1,000 a decade ago. The collapsing economy provided a new imperative: saving money. Staff members, including Mr. Fletcher, took pay cuts.
In the end 11 faculty members had their contracts terminated. Some had been at Aspen for decades. It was like letting family members go. The dismissals galvanized several faculty members who held powerful positions on the board, including Paul Kantor and Lori Schiff. They accused Mr. Fletcher of being insensitive in the way he fired their colleagues, letting them know before the summer session of 2009 in what they called brusque phone conversations.
''The fact it happened at all had a tremendous sting,'' said Mr. Kantor, a violinist who started studying at Aspen when he was 14 and has been teaching there since 1978. ''The way it was done made it worse.''
Mr. Fletcher said the dismissed faculty members were chosen purely on the basis of who brought in the fewest students. He said he thought it best to inform the dismissed musicians before the summer of 2009, so they would have more time to look for something else. The conversations had to be by phone, he added, because the individuals lived around the country.
''It's fair to say I made the wrong choice here,'' he said. Mr. Fletcher added that he underestimated the ''genuine emotion'' of the faculty. He acknowledged a deeper error: thinking of the faculty members as colleagues. ''I shouldn't have, because when things got tough, I was in fact administration,'' he said, adding that the depth of anger stunned him. ''I've had many disagreements with people,'' he said, ''but nothing like this.''
The dismissals also brought to a head friction between Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Zinman, a major American conductor. Mr. Zinman, who was appointed in 1997 and helped to found Aspen's conducting institute, said he objected to the dismissals, although there is disagreement over whether he spoke up or not. There is also a clash over who had ultimate authority to let the musicians go: Mr. Zinman, as music director, or Mr. Fletcher, as chief executive.
''Alan and I did not see eye to eye,'' Mr. Zinman said in a recent interview. ''I said it was either him or me, and they chose him.'' The main problem, he said, was Mr. Fletcher's desire to make the school ''more an elite place, smaller, only for the very best talented people. My opinion was in the other direction.''
Mr. Zinman quit in April, less than three months before the festival was to start, prompting a scramble for replacements to conduct his concerts and handle teaching.
But well before that, conflict with key board members had been mounting. They included the chairman, Rob LeBuhn, and the treasurer, Arnold Porath. In interviews both men -- Mr. LeBuhn is an investor, Mr. Porath a developer -- called Mr. Fletcher a poor manager. But Mr. LeBuhn added: ''All of these things come down to personalities. And then there are philosophical differences.''
In memorandums and e-mails to board members and to the corporation, Mr. Porath campaigned relentlessly against Mr. Fletcher's stewardship. The two wrangled over a proposed job contract renewal in September 2008. Another issue fanned the flames: Aspen's redevelopment. The festival was negotiating with the Aspen Country Day School, which shares its grounds, to expand and improve the campus. Mr. Porath was leading the effort for the festival. In an interview Mr. Fletcher said he felt Mr. Porath was too confrontational, with a ''take-no-prisoners style.''
In September Mr. Fletcher laid out his objections privately in a blistering letter to Mr. LeBuhn, calling Mr. Porath erratic and accusing him of going behind his back to musicians and meddling in management. Mr. LeBuhn immediately forwarded the letter to Mr. Porath, his ally, who was enraged.
''The chief executive officer doesn't attack a board member in writing and not pay the consequences when there are untruths in the letter,'' Mr. LeBuhn said.
Mr. Fletcher followed with a flat-out apology, but Mr. Porath insisted on a more detailed acknowledgment. The well was now truly poisoned. Mr. Fletcher said it was a ''fundamental mistake'' to put his objections in writing, but he faulted Mr. LeBuhn for leaking the e-mail to Mr. Porath.
Mr. Fletcher's musical and boardroom opponents came together in October 2009. At a special meeting of the executive committee, he was fired. The vote was 6 to 3. One of the three, the board member Michael Murray, hired a lawyer and engineered a full board meeting in November. Mr. Fletcher was rehired. But more legal wrangling delayed the announcement. On his lawyer's advice, Mr. Fletcher said, he refused to promise not to sue his board opponents.
''The executive committee action included possible libel,'' he said. He relented when Mr. LeBuhn declined to sign the contract without a general release. ''In reality was I going to sue these people? No.''
On April 29, shortly after Mr. Zinman quit, the 147-member corporation, mainly musicians, delivered a symbolic vote of no confidence in Mr. Fletcher, leading to another point of controversy. Many of the anti-Fletcher votes came by proxy. Mr. Fletcher's supporters, including Ms. Kaplinsky, fulminated that Mr. Fletcher's opponents relied on proxies. Ms. Schiff called that stance an insult to the musicians' intelligence. ''That's the system, and it's in our bylaws,'' she said. ''It's not a bunch of idiots here.''
Mr. Murray and his allies gathered forces and, on June 7, called a special meeting of the board. The board voted Mr. LeBuhn out and gave Mr. Fletcher a two-year contract. Mr. Murray took control as interim chairman until Ms. Bucksbaum agreed to take the reins as long as the parties stayed calm.
A last gasp of bitterness came on June 29, when the musicians, at a meeting of the full corporation, exercised their remaining powers by voting down the nomination of proposed trustees perceived as supporters of Mr. Fletcher. At a board meeting later in the day, when Mr. Haas appealed for people ''to listen to the music,'' Mr. Kantor made a last-ditch effort to unseat Mr. Fletcher but failed. At the meeting, several trustees told the musicians to stick to music making and teaching. Mr. Fletcher, who had earlier promised that there would be ''no retribution'' against his opponents, called on people to ''lay down their weapons,'' the minutes said.
''May it be over now,'' he added.
The assembled trustees burst into applause.

The Roots of Happiness
To the Editor:
Re ''But Will It Make You Happy?'' (Aug. 8), which described a new frugality among consumers: 
The article said research has found that people are happier when they spend their money on experiences -- like travel or concert tickets -- than on material things. But we shouldn't assume that spending of any kind will bring lasting and deep happiness.
Many people make the mistake of assuming that the achievement of something specific -- whether winning a lottery, getting a job promotion or visiting a specific country -- will bring such long-term contentment.
Instead, the best recipe for happiness is to have had loving, caring parents. If parents participate with joy in their child's activities, the child senses it. And when that child is an adult, he or she will often have a happy disposition. Jorge H. Tolaba
Putnam Valley N.Y., Aug. 8
To the Editor:
People quoted in the article have made an inspiring choice: a voluntary downsizing. I'd like to see more American families choose this path rather than be forced into it.
I hate to inject a bitter slice of reality here, but unless downsizers' employers cover their health insurance, they will be spending a big chunk of their newly lowered incomes on that coverage. And if they choose not to have insurance, one bad fracture or a complicated appendectomy may take all of that income.
Carol Wiley Cassella, M.D.
Bainbridge Island, Wash., Aug. 10
To the Editor:
Long before researchers found that experiences, not purchases, are what make us truly happy, home economists had it figured out. They taught their students that people who ''live richly'' budget more ''for books and travel, leisure and hobbies, home improvements, entertaining, and giving'' than for material possessions. So wrote Grace Margaret Morton of the University of Nebraska in 1943; she specialized in dress design but knew that mere stuff had its limitations.
It amazes me how often we rediscover the truths set forth by earlier women scholars. And don't get me started on how useful their lessons on thrift and the dangers of credit would be today. Linda Przybyszewski, Ph.D.
Notre Dame, Ind., Aug. 9

HEADLINE: The 'Cash-In' Refinancing

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
CASH-OUT refinancing, in which borrowers pull out equity from their homes to finance everything from vacations to sports cars, were all the rage during the housing boom.
Now, as the nation continues to endure the slow, painful correction of that boom, another trend may be emerging: cash-in refinancing. In this case, borrowers put extra money into a transaction to obtain cheaper loans and pay down debts.
According to Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entity that, along with Fannie Mae, helps set lending standards, 22 percent of homeowners who refinanced their mortgages in the second quarter of this year paid additional money at the closing to lower their principal balance. That ties the record for the third-highest ''cash-in'' refinancing -- set in the fourth quarter of 2002 -- since Freddie Mac began recording such transactions in 1985. The highest level was in the fourth quarter of 2009, with 36 percent of refinancing homeowners cashing in. 
Freddie Mac's chief economist, Frank Nothaft, linked the change to low interest rates on cash-equivalent investments like certificates of deposit. Consumers are finding that they can save more money on monthly interest payments by paying down their mortgages than by leaving their cash in banks, which are offering meager interest rates.
Indeed, mortgage industry executives said they had heard borrowers express such motives when choosing a cash-in refinancing strategy. But they said borrowers were also looking to qualify for a cheaper loan. Often, the more equity they have in their homes, the easier it is for them to qualify for certain loans and for lower interest rates.
Michael Moskowitz, the chief executive of Equity Now, a lender based in Manhattan, said that over the past year he had seen more borrowers add money to their mortgage refinancings with the aim of lifting equity levels high enough to qualify for a lower monthly payment.
For instance, if someone has 19 percent equity in a home -- just below the prevailing minimum down payment of 20 percent -- he or she must pay private mortgage insurance, which in turn raises the monthly payments.
Likewise, if the borrower has 29 percent equity in the home, he or she may sometimes face interest rates one-eighth of a percentage point higher than those who have 30 percent equity.
Mr. Moskowitz said it was also common for borrowers to put extra money into the refinancing transaction so they could avoid taking out a ''jumbo'' mortgage. In areas with the highest-cost housing, like New York City, loans of more than $729,750 are in that category. Elsewhere in the country, loans of more than $417,000 are considered jumbo.
Jonathan Satovsky, the chief executive of Satovsky Asset Management in Manhattan, said that one of his clients recently paid a lender about $90,000 in order to reduce the principal amount on his mortgage below $729,750, and thereby qualify for a 15-year loan at about 4.25 percent interest. In early August, Mr. Satovsky said, the 15-year fixed jumbo rate was about 4.75 percent.
BECAUSE the $90,000 payment reduced the borrower's financial flexibility, Mr. Satovsky said, he advised his client to raise that money through a home equity line of credit, or Heloc, as it is commonly known. Helocs are variable-rate loans, ''so you want to more aggressively prepay that in case rates rise,'' Mr. Satovsky said. ''But that gives you more flexibility to have that line available.''
The combination of a first mortgage and a Heloc is known as a piggyback loan, and such arrangements were popular during the mortgage boom, though they largely disappeared as home equity lenders considered them too risky.
''You definitely have to maneuver to do it now,'' Mr. Satovsky said. ''But if you're looking to manage your balance sheet creatively, it's doable.''

HEADLINE: Edward R. Casas

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Dr. Casas, 50, who started out as a surgeon, is a senior managing director and head of Navigant Capital Advisors, overseeing its distressed real estate practices, among other things. Dr. Casas, who has offices in Chicago and New York, is active in restructurings, including one involving 610 Lexington Avenue, the former Shangri-La Hotel site.
Q You're mainly based in Chicago. How often do you make it to New York? 
A A lot of my clients are out here. So from fall to spring, pretty much a couple of days a week.
Q Describe what you do at Navigant.
A I oversee distress activity. We work with a lot of institutions that have real estate asset holdings -- hedge funds and private equity funds, for example, and then also we have development clients.
We run the spectrum from the crisis-management side of restructuring -- forensic investigation; the litigation support; and the fiduciary, if you will, by taking on the ''chief restructuring officer'' role and focusing on how to recover the maximum amount of money on behalf of the creditors of those assets. It can be at a portfolio level or a single-asset level.
Q I would imagine that you're quite busy these days.
A We haven't taken our foot off the gas pedal. On the real estate side over the last 24 to 36 months, we've been involved in restructurings with over $50 billion in assets, to give you a sense of size.
Q Who are some of your clients?
A It's a sensitive situation. I can only name the ones that are already out there in public record. Our clients over the last four or five years would include guys like Cerberus and GMAC and D. E. Shaw, the hedge fund. It would include financial institutions like ING.
Q You're representing ING now.
A We represent ING as a financial institution in dealing with a workout situation on 610 Lexington. There's active discussions going on with the current developer, Aby Rosen. ING Real Estate Finance is in judicial proceedings in terms of foreclosure. We're trying to find the best way to optimize recovery for our asset: we lent much of the money for the project.
Q Where does New York stand in the recovery process?
A New York has better prospects, on average, because it has a demand function that's not just domestic, and because of that it tends to rebound faster.
I think the high, high end is insulated relatively. But not so for repositioned properties that were bought at values that looked like value in the '06-'07 vintage and now have value declines. There seem to be pockets on the residential side -- if you're in that $400,000-to-$700,000 range, it's attractive and within reach for more people. At the peak, they might have been $600,000 to $1.2 million.
Q Do you see investment opportunities in distressed property?
A The supply isn't quite there yet. The assets are being restricted on the balance sheets of the financial institutions.
Q Why aren't the banks making more deals?
A You know the expression: a rolling loan gathers no loss. Every time you recognize a loss, that affects your capital ratios. And so there's a time game that goes on. You want to shore up your reserves over time and defer your recognition of losses wherever you can.
There is a fair amount of capital that has amassed -- in REITs and funds that are focused in distressed investing. They're all waiting for something to break. But I think there has to be a confidence level in the macro economy.
Q Won't this delay inhibit the market's recovery?
A I think that stagnation is concerning people. It's like a ball and chain dragging down an institution. And that's pretty prevalent.
Q When will things loosen up?
A I think it's more in the 2011-2012 period.
Q Do you miss practicing medicine?
A The reality is, a lot of the skill sets you learn in emergency medicine are not totally different from dealing with distressed businesses: you're bleeding cash instead of blood, and you try to stop that bleeding and restore it to health.
Q What do you do for fun?
A We're avid sports fishermen. I mostly go after big tuna -- yellow fin tuna. My ''couch time'' is on the water -- it's therapeutic, and I don't think about business.
Q So what was your biggest catch?
A About 325 pounds down in Mexico, where we have a place. It took a little over two hours to bring it in.

HEADLINE: Sidewalk Entrepreneurs Grow Up

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS QUENQUA

 BODY:
IT'S an indelible image of summer: lemonade and cookies on a folding table on the sidewalk, a jar crammed with dollars, passers-by smiling politely.
A 40-year-old man selling lemonade.
Whether a sign of recession, regression or both, a handful of adults in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn have gotten into the lemonade-stand business this summer. Add it to the list of childhood pursuits that grown-ups now take seriously, along with cupcakes, T-shirts and the Transformers.
Michael Orobona, a restaurant consultant who celebrated his 40th birthday this month, has been setting up a table outside his apartment on Union Street near Fifth Avenue every weekend this summer. He said he originally intended to strike a partnership with some neighborhood children in a mutually beneficial joint venture, but refused to let their lack of interest dissuade him. 
''I'm getting to know my neighbors and my community,'' he said on a sweltering Saturday afternoon, selling what he said was organic lemonade to a woman in a floral dress ($4 for a 24-ounce cup). ''I don't just sell them lemonade, I tell them about my life.''
Mr. Orobona, a stocky, gregarious man with black leather sandals, sells three kinds of lemonade, plus iced coffee, iced tea, Rice Krispies Treats and freshly baked chocolate chip cookies (two for $1). There is a tip jar for customers looking to further reward his pluck.
A few blocks to the east, in the shadow of the food trucks parked along Grand Army Plaza, sat Jim McMahon, a sophomore at the University of Rhode Island. His colorful homemade sign read, ''College Tuition Smoothies, $4.''
Mr. McMahon, a lanky Park Slope native, has set up shop on the stoop of his family's brownstone every weekend afternoon since early July with a blender, some fruit and a sunny disposition.
''I love smoothies, my parents love smoothies,'' Mr. McMahon said in a phone interview. ''Everyone loves smoothies.''
The blurring of childhood and maturity has long been a theme in Park Slope. It was here in 2008 that parents raged against a local bar that tried to ban strollers during happy hour. And good luck telling the difference among members of the X, Y and Z generations based solely on their taste in sneakers or skateboards.
Pop-up refreshment stands have some history here, as well. When the New York City Marathon runs along Fourth Avenue every year, residents on adjacent streets frequently set up tables with hot chocolate and bagels to profit from the gathering crowds.
But enough to quit your day job? ''I realized that if I sell three an hour, I'll be making more than I was at Staples,'' said Mr. McMahon, referring to the summer job he quit last week. Now, he focuses on the smoothie trade full time.
Mr. Orobona is branching out, too. His first ''franchisee'' -- a 16-year-old boy who prefers to remain anonymous -- opened for business on Smith Street in Carroll Gardens this month. And Mr. Orobona plans to install a table on the corner of Ninth Street and Eighth Avenue soon.
''If I tell you how much I make, people won't want to buy from me anymore,'' Mr. Orobona said.
But even in Park Slope, the sight of a grown man seriously engaged in child's play will draw attention. As the customer in the floral dress walked away, a young woman on a bicycle wearing a bikini top and a skirt registered her impression. ''Elaborate lemonade stand,'' she said to Mr. Orobona.
''Thank you,'' he shouted back. Then, quietly to himself, ''Everyone has a comment.''

HEADLINE: GRAVEYARD GRIDLOCK

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
THOSE of us among the living all know New York City can be maddeningly expensive, whether one is shopping for a $40 million mansion on Fifth Avenue or a $2,500 studio walk-up in a former tenement on the Lower East Side.
For the dead, however, virtually no amount of money will secure a final resting place in the heart of a city that is fast running out of graveyard space.
And in the parts of town where a burial plot is still available, the cost has in some cases more than tripled in less than a decade; aboveground mausoleums can fetch upward of $3 million. Cemeteries are scrambling to create more space, and as plot prices have soared, the number of cremations has also risen, with a quarter of New Yorkers choosing the less expensive alternative.
Trinity Church Cemetery in Washington Heights, the last operating graveyard in Manhattan, has stopped selling plots, offering burial only in the most ''extraordinary circumstances,'' or to people with long-held reservations. 
The largest Jewish graveyard in Brooklyn, Washington Cemetery, ran out of land in the winter after tearing up roads and pathways to utilize every cubic inch of ground. Evergreens and Cypress Hills, also in Brooklyn, may sprawl, but not enough, and dozens of smaller cemeteries spread across the five boroughs are squeezed, too. The city's largest Catholic cemetery, Calvary in Queens, is close to capacity. And even the most famous of them all, Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, has only about five more years before it will be forced to stop selling plots.
More than 50 years have passed since a major cemetery was established within the city, and no new burial grounds are planned. But New Yorkers continue to die, some 60,000 a year.
Accordingly, per square foot, burial plots in centrally located cemeteries rival the most expensive real estate in the city. A private mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx can easily cost more than $1,000 per square foot.
''We have people who would like to disinter Mom and Dad and sell the graves back to make some money,'' said Richard Fishman, the director of the New York State Division of Cemeteries.
There are state laws limiting the profits on resold graves, but the fact that people would be willing to go to such lengths, Mr. Fishman said, illustrates just how valuable burial plots have become.
''There is a serious shrinkage in the available grave space,'' Mr. Fishman said. ''How many years out for each individual cemetery depends on a number of factors, but space is definitely tight.''
Other major urban areas have taken measures to alleviate similar space crunches. London allows people to be buried upright, while cemeteries in Singapore and Sydney, among others, offer ''limited tenure,'' cemetery-speak for digging up bodies after a certain amount of time so that the plot can be reused.
New York City is not now contemplating graveyard evictions, although the state did pass a law several years ago that allows cemeteries to take over empty plots bought more than 75 years ago if the owner cannot be reached. Maple Grove in Queens has already reclaimed more than 150 graves, and many other cemeteries are taking similar action, state officials said.
In fact, cemetery operators have begun to resort to the kind of creative use of space that many a Manhattan landlord might envy -- squeezing coffins into every barren inch, narrowing paths, stacking coffins nine-deep.
''We are apparently one of the first that ran out of burial space,'' said Dominick Tarantino, who runs Washington Cemetery in Brooklyn, ''but the other ones, I don't think they are too far behind me.''
From his office, the rumble of the F train can be heard as it slices through the graveyard. Look in any direction from the elevated platform at the Bay Parkway stop, and the crowding is evident, with graves pushing up against auto-body shops, apartment buildings and busy intersections. The paths are just wide enough for a golf cart; the old roads were sacrificed to tombstones. Coffins have to be unloaded from hearses outside the gate.
''We have had bribes offered, sure,'' Mr. Tarantino said. ''But we have nothing to be bribed for. We have no room.''
Just as the architecture on a city street reveals the history of the time, so do the headstones in the graveyard, which was established in 1841. There are the extravagant monuments favored in the 1920s, reminders of the boom before the Depression. Tiny white sandstone markers -- the ''baby graves,'' as the head groundskeeper, Charlie Anderson, calls them -- pop up in clusters, their fading dates coinciding with various epidemics.
On newer headstones, almost uniformly made of black marble, etched portraits of the deceased stare out at visitors. This is the style favored by the Russian Jews from neighboring Brighton Beach, who have been pleading for more room to bury their dead.
The cemetery has made a bid on an adjacent house. Even though the owner is asking a hefty sum -- $1.4 million, down from $1.8 million -- for a small house that sits on less than an acre of land, it makes economic sense for the cemetery to buy it.
But before Washington acquires more turf, Mr. Tarantino has quite a few bureaucratic hurdles to clear, including securing the approval of the City Council.
''The city does not make it too easy for us to buy land for cemetery use,'' he said one recent afternoon before heading off to meet with political leaders. If the cemetery does get the property, there is little doubt the plots will go quickly.
''Even if he could only make 400 new plots, they would sell in a week,'' said Mr. Fishman of the Division of Cemeteries.
The price for a plot before the cemetery ran out of them was $12,000. New plots would very likely be even more expensive.
''Any little piece of land, we are really getting a premium for,'' Mr. Tarantino said. And when he says little piece of land, he means that literally.
Despite the bulging waistlines that have necessitated bigger casket sizes across the country, Washington Cemetery is strict: no caskets more than 26 inches wide.
''They got to squeeze them into the box,'' Mr. Anderson said.
The plots themselves are 30 inches wide, 7 feet long and 6 feet deep. They are so close to one another that as workers prepared a site for a burial earlier this month, they had to make sure that the coffins buried in neighboring plots did not tumble into the new grave.
It might seem that an enterprising developer could find a way to make a lucrative business out of providing burial space.
But that has not happened.
First, by law, cemeteries in New York State must be nonprofit institutions. There are 35 privately owned cemeteries in the city and several dozen with religious affiliations. The closer to Manhattan and major transportation, the more crowded and expensive a burial ground will be. Farther away, particularly in Staten Island and parts of the Bronx, space is available. The indigent of New York City are buried on Hart Island in Long Island Sound.
Woodlawn, which was part of Westchester County when it was founded in 1863 but was later incorporated into the Bronx, still has burial room. It hopes to be able to offer graves for another 40 to 50 years, but that relative abundance hasn't kept its prices down.
''We want to have enough saved so that the income from the trust, once we are closed and have nothing left to sell, is enough to maintain the cemetery,'' said John P. Toale Jr., the president of Woodlawn.
While there is a space crunch in the city, there is more space in the suburbs, and cemeteries in upstate New York can barely give away plots, state officials said. Many New Yorkers who struggled and saved to live in the city end up buried elsewhere.
Even as the broader real estate market languished in the recession, prices for graves in the city continued skyward. The state regulates the fees a cemetery can charge for services like excavation, but graves sell at market price. So burial plots are a cemetery's revenue-generator.
However, the trust funds set up by cemeteries to provide income for operating costs have taken a hit, just as other institutional investments have. The number of people buying graves as part of estate planning has also dropped significantly, cemetery officials said. One reason for the decline is that 25 percent of all those who die in the city are opting to be cremated, up from 10 percent a little over a decade ago.
Prices vary from cemetery to cemetery. At land-rich Woodlawn, a single-depth grave for one starts at $6,995. A double-depth plot begins at $7,995, and a family plot ranges from $64,995 to $1.575 million.
At Green-Wood, the sprawling cemetery in Brooklyn, space is harder to come by, and entry-level prices for in-ground burial reflect this, starting at $11,000.
At Trinity's graveyard in Washington Heights, in-ground plots are sold only in extraordinary circumstances, as when former Mayor Edward I. Koch asked that a special Jewish enclave be created in the Episcopal cemetery so that he could be laid to rest in the heart of the city he once ran. He paid $20,000 for the privilege.
Like other cemeteries short on space, Trinity has resorted to aboveground crypts, which start at $9,000.
Now that an end to plot sales is in sight, Green-Wood is seeking to transform its image, according to Richard J. Moylan, its president. The graveyard charges admission for guided tours, giving people a chance to saunter through time among the tombstones of the notable and the notorious. The hope is that it will become much like Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris, a magnet for tourists.
For now, though, most city cemeteries are not so much concerned with drawing the living as finding room for the dead.
And as is true in all real estate, it's about location. Just as the apartment-hunter pays more to be near a park or to secure a sweeping view, the address within the cemetery often affects the price tag.
Being buried under a tree is more desirable than being out in the open. A plot that is easy to get to can be more valuable than one in the back 40. A neighborhood of ornate Victorian marble can cost more than an avenue of flat, mowable markers. And then there are the specific needs and wants of different cultural groups.
For instance, many Asians prefer to be buried on hilltops.
''The Chinese especially, they will literally buy the whole mountaintop,'' Mr. Fishman said. ''They would pay a fortune for that.''
Even a fortune, however, cannot buy a hilltop once there are no more hilltops to be bought.

HEADLINE: Director Striving to Open Vast Collection of Artifacts

BYLINE: By PATRICK DILLON. 
patrick@stamen.com

 BODY:
Phoebe Hearst, the mining heiress and matriarch of the University of California, Berkeley, was not a woman of modest ambition, as her personal quest to create a world-class anthropology collection demonstrated.
Beginning in the 1890s, Ms. Hearst, the mother of William Randolph Hearst, commissioned large expeditions around the globe. She sent Max Uhle, the renowned German archaeologist, to Peru; Alfred Emerson, the classics scholar, was dispatched to Greece and Italy in search of marble sculpture; and she sent Alfred Kroeber, one of the United States' foremost anthropologists (for whom the department of anthropology building at Berkeley would eventually be named) to American Indian camps throughout California and the Southwest.
Objects were bought or excavated and transported on barges, horse-drawn wagons or even by foot back to Berkeley. Collections were arranged according to a coherent plan Ms. Hearst had insisted on and sorted by tribe, site or time frame. They were documented with field notes, photographs, maps and even wax sound recordings to provide the basis for scholarship. These became the core of the collection, numbering some 60,000 items at the time of her death in 1919.
Her goal was a museum to rival those at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, and by at least one standard she succeeded: the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology at Berkeley now has some four million items. 
What Ms. Hearst failed to anticipate, though, was that nearly all those objects would for more than half a century be largely inaccessible to all but a handful of scholars due to less-than-optimal facilities and the faculty's tradition of viewing the collection primarily as a research tool.
That dual legacy -- a brilliant collection but with a low public profile -- is what Mari Lyn Salvador inherited when she took over as the museum's director in December.
Ms. Salvador has embarked on an ambitious effort to centralize the museum and bring it to the public. If she succeeds, the Bay Area could eventually be host to a world-class anthropology museum that boasts the open access that its founder envisioned.
''Phoebe Hearst believed in public education, research and learning, not just in acquiring objects,'' Ms. Salvador said. ''The museum should become an open source.''
The collection is housed in more than 100,000 square feet in scattered facilities on or near the campus, but Ms. Salvador said she dreamed of a new facility that could accommodate research and that included a hands-on open study section and a public museum. She envisions interactive online access to the collection, as well as video-streaming courses from faculty members and other scholars.
That vision, Ms. Salvador concedes, would carry a hefty price tag. She demurs at identifying a hard number, mindful of the economy and the state's budget shortfall, saying instead that fund-raising will occur in stages over the next seven or more years. The current operating budget is $3 million, of which $1.275 million was paid by the state in the 2008-9 fiscal year, down about $50,000 from the previous year, Ms. Salvador said.
In the meantime, work has begun on creating a contemporary catalog of the collection. Michael Black, a boyish scholar with a doctorate in human evolution who manages the museum's research and information systems, is busy digitizing old, barely discernible, sometimes handwritten catalog cards.
''For a century, this information was tightly controlled,'' Mr. Black said. ''We got resistance from the old academics who didn't want us giving away information they felt entitled to keep to themselves in order to lure their graduate students.''
''We're mere custodians,'' Mr. Black added. ''My job is to get the collection documented and deliverable to the most people.''
Robert Price, associate vice chancellor for research at Berkeley, said in an e-mail: ''Unfortunately, the museum has not had a facility with which it could adequately display its world-class collections. Going forward, and under the leadership of the museum's new director, we intend to raise the funds to construct such a building so that the public can enjoy the Hearst's priceless treasures.''
Ms. Salvador has begun inviting people in. At the end of April, artifacts from the Egyptian collection were put on display -- first for a group of third graders who had spent a year studying Egyptology, and then for the general public.
A visit to the labyrinthine catacombs beneath the museum reveals a broad range of treasures -- 1,500-year-old Peruvian tapestries, Egyptian pottery from early 20th-century expeditions joined by Ms. Hearst herself, Turkish dervish skirts, American Indian baskets adorned with quail topknot feathers.
Using a heavy metal wheel, Natasha Johnson, a museum collection manager, swings open a high, sturdy metal vault. With a look of reverence and childish excitement, she slides out one of the shelves -- marked 1-19477 -- to reveal a single, luminous, finely tapered, nearly three-inch-long triangle, which turns out to be an early 20th-century arrowhead.
The story behind the object is as compelling as its beauty. It was fashioned from brown glass by Ishi, the last surviving member of the Yana, the last of California's indigenous tribes, who lived as if in the Stone Age in the Sierra foothills until discovered in 1911.
Ishi actually lived for a period in the Hearst Museum; he became an ex officio member of the faculty, offering firsthand insights into a departed culture.
Ms. Salvador made a name for herself as a scholar of ancient Panamanian textiles, as well as serving on the faculty at the University of New Mexico and as the director of the Museum of Man in San Diego. She earned her bachelor's degree, master's degree and Ph.D. in cultural anthropology from Berkeley, but said she hesitated at first to take a job at her alma mater given the challenges with the museum and its known emphasis on research.
But she said she was attracted to the challenge of creating a public museum while preserving the research tradition.
''All the scholarship is not going away,'' Ms. Salvador said. ''But should scholarship be confined to recognized scholars? To learn or understand deeply one's own culture is to learn and respect other cultures. Students should curate their own shows. Members of communities represented here can not only rediscover their heritage but teach us, as well.''
Those are sweet words to Ira Jacknis, a research anthropologist who has been at the museum for 20 ''sometimes trying'' years.
''As it stands,'' Mr. Jacknis said, ''we are a big museum in terms of collection, but in terms of square footage and display space in ratio to our objects, we are tiny. Similar museums at the Universities of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, New Mexico and Arizona all have more space and more modern facilities housing far fewer items.''
Mr. Jacknis, the museum's resident anthropologist and a Hearst scholar, also sings the collection's praises. ''I still step down into the collections in our basement and know I am in a fantastic space,'' he said. ''I come to work every day and learn something new.''
The American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in Washington are also not open viewing centers. Only 2 percent of the 30 million specimens and artifacts held by the New York museum are within public view at any one time. The rest, a spokesman said, ''remain invaluable resources for museum scientists and their colleagues worldwide.''
Ms. Salvador said she had no illusions about the Hearst Museum's becoming a million-square-foot Smithsonian of the West. Her dream, she contends, is to continue Phoebe Hearst's dream for the collection, as articulated in a letter Ms. Hearst wrote on July 24, 1900, to a colleague at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, to facilitate ''the dissemination of knowledge among the many, not the pride of possession by the few.''

HEADLINE: Scissors, Glue, Pencils? Check. Cleaning Spray?

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
When Emily Cooper headed off to first grade in Moody, Ala., last week, she was prepared with all the stuff on her elementary school's must-bring list: two double rolls of paper towels, three packages of Clorox wipes, three boxes of baby wipes, two boxes of garbage bags, liquid soap, Kleenex and Ziplocs.
''The first time I saw it, my mouth hit the floor,'' Emily's mother, Kristin Cooper, said of the list, which also included perennials like glue sticks, scissors and crayons. 
Schools across the country are beginning the new school year with shrinking budgets and outsize demands for basic supplies. And while many parents are wincing at picking up the bill, retailers are rushing to cash in by expanding the back-to-school category like never before.
Now some back-to-school aisles are almost becoming janitorial-supply destinations as multipacks of paper towels, cleaning spray and hand sanitizer are crammed alongside pens, notepads and backpacks.
OfficeMax is featuring items like Clorox wipes in its school displays and is running two-for-one specials on cleaners like gum remover and disinfectant spray. Office Depot has added paper towels and hand sanitizer to its back-to-school aisles. Staples' school fliers show reams of copy paper on sale, while Walgreens' fliers are running back-to-school discounts on Kleenex.
State and local school financing, which make up almost all of public schools' money, is falling because of budget-balancing efforts and lower property- and sales-tax revenue.
''Some of the things that have been historically provided by schools, we're not able to provide at this point,'' said Barbara A. Chester, president of the National Association of Elementary School Principals.
On the list for pre-kindergartners at McClendon Elementary in Nevada, Tex.: a package of cotton balls, two containers of facial tissue, rolls of paper towels, sheaves of manila and construction paper, and a package of paper sandwich bags.
Pre-kindergartners in the Joshua school district in Texas have to track down Dixie cups and paper plates, while students at New Central Elementary in Havana, Ill., and Mesa Middle School in Castle Rock, Colo., must come to class with a pack of printer paper. Wet Swiffer refills and plastic cutlery are among the requests from St. Joseph School in Seattle. And at Pauoa Elementary School in Honolulu, every student must show up with a four-pack of toilet paper.
For the retailers, back-to-school season is second only to the holidays, and parents' longer school-supply lists are a bonus -- especially at a time when shoppers are reluctant to spend. While the impact is not enormous, retailers are looking for anything to lift sales.
''It's newfound business that the retailers didn't have a year or two ago,'' said Steve Mahurin, executive vice president of merchandising for Office Depot.
The shift is notable even at stores that sell much more than office supplies.
''When I walk through the back rooms of our stores where the layaway orders are stored, not only are you seeing things you expect to see -- computers, apparel,'' said Mark Snyder, chief marketing officer of Kmart, ''you're seeing these sort of household supplies that teachers are asking, school systems are asking, kids to now bring.''
For several years, the lists have been getting lengthier, but in many parts of the country, educators and retailers say, the economic downturn has also pushed them into uncharted territory. ''It's definitely spiked this year,'' said Bob Thacker, senior vice president of marketing and advertising at OfficeMax.
Many stores have tailored their offerings to reflect the demands of local schools, collecting the back-to-school supply lists and stocking inventory accordingly.
Mr. Thacker said the change had meant bigger orders this summer of things like cleaning supplies and paper towels. ''It's just changed the way our merchants buy things for their different areas,'' he said.
In some places, though, parents being asked to make up depleted school budgets are under budget pressure, too, which has left schools without a clear solution.
Malcolm Thomas, the superintendent of the Escambia County school district on Florida's Gulf Coast, has put supplies like plastic bags, Kleenex and soap under an ''optional'' category because ''we know that people in our community are hurting,'' he said. He also seeks donations from local businesses.
If those efforts don't bring in enough supplies, it means either his teachers -- who start at a salary of $32,500 -- usually pay for the supplies themselves, or the district ''would probably have to get into cutting personnel if we had to supply absolutely everything,'' he said.
In Noblesville, Ind., Kristi Smith, 41, a teacher's aide, said she was sympathetic to the cost pressures at her daughters' elementary school, but she also thought the supply list was a little extreme.
''Sometimes I think it's too much,'' she said. ''Is my fourth grader really going to use 50 pencils herself?''
Ms. Cooper, the Alabama mother, spent her summer making the most of the school-supply stores' new interest in classroom supplies. ''Each week I go to the stores' Web sites -- Staples, OfficeMax, Office Depot,'' she said, and posts the deals on a blog for fellow bargain hunters. ''All three of these major stores are offering jaw-dropping deals every week,'' she said.
And as overwhelming as it might seem to some parents, she would rather buy the goods than expect Emily's teacher to do so, she said.
''We don't expect Wal-Mart cashiers to buy the plastic bags for our groceries, or the mailman to pay for the gas to deliver our mail,'' Ms. Cooper said.

HEADLINE: Gods, Goddesses and Elephants for Luck

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE ROSENBLUM. 
E-mail: habitats@nytimes.com

 BODY:
BHARATI SUKUL KEMRAJ, a 27-year-old reporter and producer for the public access television channel Bronxnet, lives with her parents and three of her five siblings in a brick and stucco house near Sound View Park in the Bronx. Her two older sisters, who have their own families, live nearby. Especially with five grandchildren coming and going, the premises bustle with lively family meals and youngsters underfoot.
But even when Ms. Kemraj is here by herself, she is hardly alone.
Particularly in the living room, the heart of the house, she is surrounded by dozens of Hindu gods and goddesses who constitute a virtual second family. These tabletop deities, executed in plastic, porcelain, copper and even marble, are outfitted to the nines in jewel-tone silk and organdy and draped with strands of beads and garlands of flowers. 
Shiva, Krishna, Ganesh and the rest are here partly because faith plays so critical a role in the family's life. Ms. Kemraj's father, Pandit Vishnu Sukul Kemraj, is a Hindu priest; her oldest brother, Vyaas, 22, is following in his father's footsteps. But it is largely thanks to Ms. Kemraj's mother, Chandra Sukul Kemraj, that this room feels like a lavishly appointed place of worship.
Or, as Ms. Kemraj sums up the situation with both affection and understatement: ''My mother lives in her own dreamy little world. And what you see in this house is the result.''
The parents immigrated from Guyana in 1986, and Ms. Kemraj, the third child, arrived in New York a few years later, when she was 7. In 1994 the family bought a house near Pelham Parkway, and two years later Pandit Sukul Kemraj became the priest of Vishnu Mandir, a Hindu temple created from a single-family house that he bought onNoble Avenue near Westchester Avenue.
But his days were spent driving a school bus, and the additional time he spent commuting between house and temple for twice-daily services proved onerous. So he built a house for his family on the empty lot that he owned next to the temple.
The two-story structure carried a price tag of $350,000 -- a figure made more manageable by a generous mortgage -- and was completed in the fall of 2007. The family moved in just in time for Christmas, which they celebrate even though they are Hindus. As if underscoring how pleased everyone is to be here, half a dozen welcome mats march up to the front door.
The temple, which is attached to the house, is lushly decorated. Exquisitely dressed statues of gods and goddesses line its walls, and during services, music from drums, tambourines, harmonium and brass bells fills the air. Many of these vivid images are captured in weekly television programs devoted to the Hindu community that Ms. Kemraj produces for Bronxnet.
But the family's house seems an equally holy place, and nowhere more than the altarlike assemblage of religious figures in the front window.
''Here's Ganesh, the god of knowledge, who has the head of an elephant and a trunk,'' Ms. Kemraj said. ''Here's Shiva the destroyer,with the green snakes around his neck. Here's Rama, the demon slayer, with a bow and a quiver of arrows. Here's Ganga, the goddess of the Ganges, the holy river, sitting on the body of an alligator.''
The list goes on.
''Here's Krishna, with his flute, and here's Kali, with all the arms and the necklace of skulls around her neck to destroy evil.''
The female deities wear vibrantly colored saris shot with gold thread and flecked with pearls, turquoise sequins and winking rhinestones. Sometimes the figures are draped with fresh flowers and scented with incense. The family prays to them every morning.
If gods and goddesses keep watch over this household, elephants bring good fortune.
''When we first moved to our new house,'' Ms. Kemraj recalled, ''I remember giving my mom $100, and she used that, along with some of her own money, to buy a porcelain baby elephant.''
That elephant, which was made in India, stands on plump white feet and is adorned with painted flowers and gold tusks. ''You can see that its trunk is up, which means good luck,'' Ms. Kemraj said, stroking the animal's glossy back.
Since its arrival, the baby elephant has been joined by others, each more adorable than the last. Some are hand-painted, splashed with gold, sprayed with glitter and topped by rose-covered vases. Others have been further adorned by Ms. Kemraj's mother.
Mrs. Sukul Kemraj has also worked her decorative magic on more unlikely subjects, among them porcelain dolls that have the look of Victorian milkmaids, complete with blond ringlets, fans and lace party dresses. One doll has a bindi, the red dot traditionally applied to the forehead of Southeast Asian women. Other dolls have been touched up with crimson lipstick, matching nail polish and spider webs of henna on the backs of their hands. Some resemble Barbies retrofitted for life halfway across the world.
''My mother decorates the dolls and the deities because she wants their beauty and their real-life feelings to show,'' Ms. Kemraj said. ''Whatever she collects, she adds her own little touch of creativeness.''
The mother has also addressed the issue of pets in her own distinctive way. With so many grandchildren underfoot, having a dog seemed one chore too many. So Mrs. Sukul Kemraj has installed a kennel's worth of china puppies near the front door, by the plastic-covered brown brocade sofas and the coffee table topped with a sequined pink and brown tablecloth.
The decor has an ecumenical quality. Above the doorway to the kitchen hangs a red velvet Mexican sombrero flecked with gold sequins. The family celebrates Christmas with a tree, and Easter with pastel decorations.
With four children still living under the parental roof, space in the three upstairs bedrooms is tight. In the boys' room, a harmonium vies with a PlayStation. In the room occupied by Ms. Kemraj, whose duties at Bronxnet include working as a health correspondent and a fill-in host, tools of her trade like cameras reflect her interests as faithfully as her collection of silvery Indian bangles.
The parents' room includes a set of bunk beds where the grandchildren sleep when they're visiting, and Ms. Kemraj occasionally sleeps there, too. She realizes that 27 is a little old for this sort of thing. But she feels fortunate to be still safely ensconced in the parental nest. ''With the economy in the shape it's in,'' she said, ''I feel lucky that I can live here with my family.''
Something else keeps her rooted here in this house, at least for now. ''Back in Guyana,'' Ms. Kemraj said, ''people always think about coming to America and making a better life for themselves. Here in New York, we don't make so much money. We can't spend and spend. But having stuff around that you like means a lot.''

HEADLINE: Double Dip? A Tipping Point May Be Near

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
LIKE a car spinning its wheels, the American economy hasn't been getting much traction. Many financial indicators are issuing worrisome signals, millions of people are still out of work, and growth is slowing.
Will the economy pick up momentum or slip back into recession? Unfortunately, the answer is very much in doubt.
''We are at a very critical moment in the business cycle,'' said Lakshman Achuthan, the managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a private forecasting group with an excellent track record. After the economy began to recover last summer, in his estimation, ''growth has definitely slowed.'' But he said he wouldn't have enough data until at least the fall to know ''whether we're dipping back into recession.'' 
Even the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, calls the current economic outlook ''unusually uncertain.'' And the financial markets have certainly noticed.
''The market is favoring investments thought to have no risk, like Treasuries, as opposed to assets with risk, like stocks -- and that's been becoming more and more pronounced,'' said William H. Gross, co-chief investment officer of the Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco, the big bond manager.
In the bond market last week, safety-seeking investors bid up the prices of Treasury securities, driving down yields to extraordinarily low levels along a broad range of maturities -- and extending the astonishing rally of long-term Treasury bonds, which continue to outperform the stock market and nearly every other asset class.
For the year, for example, long-term Treasuries have returned more than 15 percent, as gauged by the Barclays Capital U.S. 20+ Year Treasury Bond index. By comparison, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has lost more than 2 percent, including dividends. And over the decade through July, long-term Treasuries outperformed the S.& P. 500 by more than 8.6 percentage points, annualized, according to Morningstar data.
The stock market was particularly shaky last week. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 265.42 points, or 2.5 percent, its biggest decline since June. For the week, the Dow lost more than 350 points, or 3.3 percent, closing at 10,303.15, while the S.& P. fell more than 42 points, or 3.8 percent, to 1,079.25.
This preference for bonds over stocks, which has emerged periodically since the financial crisis began in 2008, came into high relief after the Fed's announcement on Tuesday that it would recycle the proceeds of its mortgage bond portfolio into Treasuries.
Considering the Fed balance sheet -- now approximately $2.3 trillion, up from $900 billion before the financial crisis -- the central bank's latest move was modest. It will translate into $200 million to $400 million in purchases of Treasuries over 12 months, according to an estimate by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. But it was the direction the Fed was taking -- its decision to maintain an expansive monetary policy through ''quantitative easing,'' rather than to begin monetary tightening -- that was most striking.
''Ben Bernanke's motto seems to be that he will do whatever it takes to avoid a depression and avert deflation,'' said Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. ''He has been very successful so far,'' lowering interest rates along the yield curve and thereby stimulating the economy.
The Fed may need to go it alone over the next several months, several analysts said, because with midterm elections approaching, additional fiscal stimulus legislation may be too controversial.
Mr. Achuthan of the Economic Cycle institute said a weakening in the economy's growth rate began to appear in the institute's leading indicators early in the winter. ''Now, that slowdown is baked in the cake, it's already happening,'' he said.
The Fed acknowledged as much last week. In a statement on Tuesday, its Open Market Committee said that the recovery pace had ''slowed'' and that growth ''is likely to be more modest in the near term than had been anticipated.''
It's too early to know whether the economy will tip into an actual decline, Mr. Achuthan said. The institute's Weekly Leading Index ticked up again on Friday, after a steep plunge through late June. It's possible that the Fed ''will be able to use its influence'' to engineer a soft landing and avert another, immediate recession, he said. In September or October, he said, there may be more clarity.
MR. GROSS of Pimco said the growing American trade deficit -- it jumped to $49.9 billion in June, its highest level since October 2008, according to a report on Wednesday -- is cutting into the G.D.P., ''implying that second-quarter G.D.P. is going to be in the 1 to 2 percent range.'' In turn, he said, ''that implies that the momentum of the economy from the first to the second quarter was downhill, and therefore we think ''it's quite possible that we might actually be somewhere between zero and 1 percent -- in other words, very close to a double-dip recession.''
He put the probability of a recession -- and of an accompanying bout of deflation -- at 25 to 35 percent.
Still, the economic signs are ambiguous. After falling in the spring, industrial commodity prices have risen, suggesting that there is still surging demand from manufacturers. Shipping indexes, which had declined, have ticked upward again over the last month. Mortgage rates are dropping. And thanks in large part to fierce cost-cutting, very low interest rates, and strong demand in developing countries, corporate profits have been strong.
What's been lacking is broad consumer demand, a revival of the housing market and sufficient business confidence in large-scale hiring. And, of course, there are deep structural economic problems -- the highest ratio of public debt to gross domestic product since World War II, for example -- that will need to be dealt with over many years.
Nonetheless, if there is good news in the fall -- if it becomes clear that the pace of recovery has begun to accelerate -- there could easily be another burst of stock market exuberance, Mr. Achuthan said. ''Interest rates are very low,'' he said, ''and if you were to combine that with economic growth, you've got a wonderful recipe for profits.''
In the meantime, Mr. Gross said, with the Fed funneling money into Treasuries, the improbable rally in the bond market may still have a way to go.

HEADLINE: In Weather Chaos, a Case for Global Warming

BYLINE: By JUSTIN GILLIS; John Collins Rudolf contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The floods battered New England, then Nashville, then Arkansas, then Oklahoma -- and were followed by a deluge in Pakistan that has upended the lives of 20 million people.
The summer's heat waves baked the eastern United States, parts of Africa and eastern Asia, and above all Russia, which lost millions of acres of wheat and thousands of lives in a drought worse than any other in the historical record.
Seemingly disconnected, these far-flung disasters are reviving the question of whether global warming is causing more weather extremes.
The collective answer of the scientific community can be boiled down to a single word: probably. 
''The climate is changing,'' said Jay Lawrimore, chief of climate analysis at the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. ''Extreme events are occurring with greater frequency, and in many cases with greater intensity.''
He described excessive heat, in particular, as ''consistent with our understanding of how the climate responds to increasing greenhouse gases.''
Theory suggests that a world warming up because of those gases will feature heavier rainstorms in summer, bigger snowstorms in winter, more intense droughts in at least some places and more record-breaking heat waves. Scientists and government reports say the statistical evidence shows that much of this is starting to happen.
But the averages do not necessarily make it easier to link specific weather events, like a given flood or hurricane or heat wave, to climate change. Most climate scientists are reluctant to go that far, noting that weather was characterized by remarkable variability long before humans began burning fossil fuels and releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
''If you ask me as a person, do I think the Russian heat wave has to do with climate change, the answer is yes,'' said Gavin Schmidt, a climate researcher with NASA in New York. ''If you ask me as a scientist whether I have proved it, the answer is no -- at least not yet.''
In Russia, that kind of scientific caution might once have been embraced. Russia has long played a reluctant, and sometimes obstructionist, role in global negotiations over limiting climate change, perhaps in part because it expected economic benefits from the warming of its vast Siberian hinterland.
But the extreme heat wave, and accompanying drought and wildfires, in normally cool central Russia seems to be prompting a shift in thinking.
''Everyone is talking about climate change now,'' President Dmitri A. Medvedev told the Russian Security Council this month. ''Unfortunately, what is happening now in our central regions is evidence of this global climate change, because we have never in our history faced such weather conditions in the past.''
Thermometer measurements show that the earth has warmed by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since the Industrial Revolution, when humans began pumping enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. For this January through July, average temperatures were the warmest on record, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Friday.
The warming has moved in fits and starts, and the cumulative increase may sound modest. But it is an average over the entire planet, representing an immense amount of added heat, and is only the beginning of a trend that most experts believe will worsen substantially.
If the earth were not warming, random variations in the weather should cause about the same number of record-breaking high temperatures and record-breaking low temperatures over a given period. But climatologists have long theorized that in a warming world, the added heat would cause more record highs and fewer record lows.
The statistics suggest that is exactly what is happening. In the United States these days, about two record highs are being set for every record low, telltale evidence that amid all the random variation of weather, the trend is toward a warmer climate.
Climate-change skeptics dispute such statistical arguments, contending that climatologists do not know enough about long-range patterns to draw definitive links between global warming and weather extremes. They cite events like the heat and drought of the 1930s as evidence that extreme weather is nothing new. Those were indeed dire heat waves, contributing to the Dust Bowl, which dislocated millions of Americans and changed the population structure of the United States.
But most researchers trained in climate analysis, while acknowledging that weather data in parts of the world are not as good as they would like, offer evidence to show that weather extremes are getting worse.
A United States government report published in 2008 noted that ''in recent decades, most of North America has been experiencing more unusually hot days and nights, fewer unusually cold days and nights, and fewer frost days. Heavy downpours have become more frequent and intense.''
The statistics suggest that the Eastern United States may be getting wetter as the arid West dries out further. Places that depend on the runoff from spring snow melt appear particularly vulnerable to climate change, because higher temperatures are making the snow melt earlier, leaving the ground parched by midsummer. That can worsen any drought that develops.
''Global warming, ironically, can actually increase the amount of snow you get,'' said Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. ''But it also means the snow season is shorter.''
In general, the research suggests that global warming will worsen climate extremes across much of the planet. As in the United States, wet areas will get wetter, the scientists say, while dry areas get drier.
But the patterns are not uniform; changes in wind and ocean circulation could cause unexpected effects, with some areas even cooling down in a warmer world. And long-established weather patterns, like the periodic variations in the Pacific Ocean known as El Nino, will still contribute to unusual events, like heavy rains and cool temperatures in normally arid parts of California.
Scientists say they expect stronger storms, in winter and summer, largely because of the physical principle that warmer air can hold more water vapor.
Typically, a storm of the sort that inundated parts of Tennessee in May, dumping as much as 19 inches of rain over two days, draws moisture from an area much larger than the storm itself. With temperatures rising and more water vapor in the air, such storms can pull in more moisture and thus rain or snow more heavily than storms of old.
It will be a year or two before climate scientists publish definitive analyses of the Russian heat wave and the Pakistani floods, which might shed light on the role of climate change, if any. Some scientists suspect that they were caused or worsened by an unusual kink in the jet stream, the high-altitude flow of air that helps determine weather patterns, though that itself might be linked to climate change. Certain recent weather events were so extreme that a few scientists are shedding their traditional reluctance to ascribe specific disasters to global warming.
After a heat wave in Europe in 2003 that killed an estimated 50,000 people, the worst such catastrophe for that region in the historical record, scientists published detailed analyses suggesting that it would not have been as severe in a climate uninfluenced by greenhouse gases.
And Dr. Trenberth has published work suggesting that Hurricane Katrina dumped at least somewhat more rain on the Gulf Coast because the storm was intensified by global warming.
''It's not the right question to ask if this storm or that storm is due to global warming, or is it natural variability,'' Dr. Trenberth said. ''Nowadays, there's always an element of both.''

HEADLINE: Questions For Barney Frank

 BODY:
Deborah Solomon's interview was enlightening. That a Democrat, Barney Frank of Massachusetts, is working with a Republican colleague, Ron Paul of Texas, to introduce legislation shrinking the size of government, legalizing marijuana and bringing home troops from nations with no current military threats makes sense.
In our era of highly partisan politics, it gives me hope that Congress members from different parties and ideological commitments can come together on behalf of all Americans. Both appear to understand that our basic civil and economic liberties prosper best when government stays out of the bedroom and the marketplace. Perhaps Frank and Paul are role models others should be emulating.

HEADLINE: Fighting Tooth and Nail, Unions Overstep

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEBER. 
Jonathan Weber is the editor in chief of The Bay Citizen. jweber@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Michael Moritz, one of Silicon Valley's most successful venture capitalists, keeps a low profile. An early backer of Yahoo and Google, Mr. Moritz avoids the press, though he was himself once a journalist. You never see him at industry conferences. While he has given money to President Obama and a few other politicians of both parties, he has no discernible political ambitions.
But he does apparently feel strongly about the need to change the public employee pension system in San Francisco -- and his recent decision to contribute $245,000 to that cause has provoked a furious counterattack by public employee unions. Deriding Mr. Moritz as a ''billionaire speculator,'' a group of unions organized a noisy protest last week in front of his San Francisco home. 
The demonstration followed the unions' vituperative denunciation of an accountant named Craig Weber, who made the mistake of endorsing a pension overhaul while serving on a civil grand jury investigating the issue. Though Mr. Weber (no relation) had cleared his action with the grand jury's presiding judge and the city attorney, union leaders have demanded a criminal investigation.
On one level, all of this simply underscores a political reality here: you cross the unions at your peril. (Mr. Moritz evidently missed the memo; after last week's hoo-ha, he's refusing to discuss the issue.)
But there is another political reality at play: public resentment of government employees' job security and fat benefits at a time when many workers are suffering.
And that raises another question: Are union leaders shooting themselves in the foot?
Playing the class-war card against someone like Mr. Moritz is a questionable tactic. Sure, he's very rich, but he got that way doing exactly what makes the local economy tick -- investing in innovative companies that grow to create good jobs and wealth. In any case, none of the city workers I interviewed at last week's protest had any idea who Mr. Moritz was.
The assault on Mr. Weber also seems over the top, given that there is no evidence he is anything other than a concerned citizen volunteering his time to wrestle with a difficult policy issue.
The unions contend that the voter initiative, known as Proposition B and spearheaded by the San Francisco public defender, Jeff Adachi, is really about slashing health benefits. City workers have already agreed to give-backs, union leaders note. Yet Proposition B, besides forcing bigger employee contributions to the pension plan, mandates large increases in their contributions for dependent health care premiums.
Bob Muscat, a local union leader who is heading the anti-Proposition B campaign, is unapologetic about the tactics. ''There is nothing sincere in what they are saying or doing,'' Mr. Muscat said, ''so it does get very personal.'' His anger at Mr. Adachi, who he believes is merely trying to advance his political career, is unconcealed.
While Proposition B will clearly save the city a lot of money, its specific long-term impacts depend on the investment performance of the pension funds, actuarial calculations and the cost of health care. Mr. Adachi says benefits, if not reined in, will lead to even more cuts in services and ultimately bankrupt the city. The unions disagree, and cite health care premium increases of as much as $350 a month.
Yet the fact remains that San Francisco city workers are among the best paid anywhere. The average salary is $93,000. Workers can retire at 55 in some cases, 62 in others, with pensions of up to 75 percent to 90 percent of their salaries.
This is not lost on voters, so it seems an inopportune time for the unions to go to war. Transit workers have already set themselves up for defeat this fall, when voters will most likely revoke a charter provision guaranteeing their high pay.
If the city unions were to make a more measured case against Proposition B, they might win more support. The health care rollbacks could garner sympathy. The unions could also show more clearly how they are sharing the pain.
But the scorched-earth approach of trying to intimidate the opposition into silence looks politically risky, and perhaps even desperate. ''When you're in court and you don't have a good case, you attack your opponent,'' Mr. Adachi said.
Surely San Francisco voters would be better served by an honest and civilized debate.

HEADLINE: Obama Warns of Privatizing Social Security

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama has taken the lead in a Democratic offensive on Social Security, warning that Republicans will revive efforts to privatize what is perhaps the government's most popular program if they seize control of Congress in the November elections. 
''I'll fight with everything I've got to stop those who would gamble your Social Security on Wall Street,'' Mr. Obama said on Saturday in his weekly national address. ''Because you shouldn't be worried that a sudden downturn in the stock market will put all you've worked so hard for -- all you've earned -- at risk.''
The president's comments amplified a campaign kicked off in recent days by Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and Congressional leaders that is tied to the 75th anniversary on Saturday of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's signing of the Social Security Act.
While the issue of support for Social Security is often a staple of Democratic campaigns, a number of Republican candidates -- in particular, Senate hopefuls in Colorado, Kentucky and Nevada -- have provided new ammunition with their comments against the program.
Also, by allowing Democrats to recall President George W. Bush's unsuccessful effort to overhaul Social Security so that workers could divert their payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts, the issue fits into what has become the Democrats' overarching theme for the midterm elections -- that the Republicans' return to power would mean a return to Bush-era policies.
And it gives Mr. Obama and Democratic candidates a way to try to improve their own weak standing among retirement-age voters, who make up roughly 40 percent of those who cast ballots in midterm election years.
''A few years ago, we had a debate about privatizing Social Security,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And I'd have thought that debate would've been put to rest once and for all by the financial crisis we've just experienced.''
Katie Wright, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, responded: ''Rather than working with Republicans to solve this issue, Democrats have resorted to fear-mongering in an attempt to divert voters' attention away from their failed economic record.''
The political debate comes amid new evidence of the program's troubled finances, which is stoking the talk of what legislative action might be ahead.
The annual report of the trustees of Social Security, released this month, showed that for the first time since 1983, because of high unemployment, the program this year will pay out more in benefits than it collects in payroll revenues. Such annual deficits will become routine in several years as more baby boomers retire, the trustees said, and the program's reserves will be exhausted in 2037. After that, revenues from workers' payroll taxes will cover three-quarters of benefits to retirees.
Mr. Obama said ''we've been talking for a long time'' about how to address Social Security's increasing costs and declining revenues. ''And I'm committed to working with anyone, Democrat or Republican, who wants to strengthen Social Security.''
He emphasized, ''One thing we can't afford to do, though, is privatize Social Security.''

HEADLINE: Despite Flurry of Achievement, No Reveling for Democrats

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who played a pivotal role as the 111th Congress passed several major pieces of legislation, said his party had a fundamental problem.
''Democrats don't know how to celebrate,'' said Mr. Dodd, suggesting that his colleagues should be reveling in the achievements of what Democrats and Republicans agree is one of the most consequential Congressional sessions in decades. ''In the face of unyielding opposition, this president and this Congress stepped up to pass historic legislation for the good of the country.''
As they finally wrapped up their business for the summer with Thursday's approval of additional border security money, Congressional Democrats remained on the political defensive, bracing for potentially steep House and Senate losses in the coming midterm elections. 
It is a point of frustration to Democrats that much of the public seems unimpressed by the litany of legislation signed into law in the first two years of President Obama's term: the $787 billion stimulus package, an anti-age-discrimination law, long-sought tobacco regulation, expanded community service, credit card consumer protection, the landmark health care law, Pentagon contracting changes, Wall Street regulation, tax cuts, credits and more.
Except for a climate change bill, the Obama administration and Congressional Democrats have followed through on the agenda laid out at the beginning of the 111th Congress in January 2009 despite concerted Republican opposition. The victories were wrenching, partisan and procedurally ugly, but they were victories.
''He said what he was going to do, and he did it,'' the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, said about the president.
While Republicans consider much of the legislation flawed and even harmful, they grudgingly concede that Democrats compiled a record perhaps unrivaled since the Great Society programs of President Lyndon B. Johnson were passed during the 89th Congress or the New Deal programs were pushed through the 73rd Congress by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. And though they had large majorities, Democrats did not have substantial opposition help or the cushion that Roosevelt had with 313 Democrats in the House from 1933 to 1935, or the 68 Senate seats that Democrats controlled during Johnson's tenure in 1965.
Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, said Democrats pushed through legislation that was breathtaking in size and scope, even though approval typically came on very thin margins and party-line votes in the Senate.
''This is big stuff,'' Mr. Sessions said. ''They would probably say it was great for America. I would say it was bad for America.''
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, is often assailed by Democrats for blocking the Democratic agenda. He said the results absolved him of that charge.
''I am amused with their comments about obstructionism,'' Mr. McConnell said in an interview. ''I wish we had been able to obstruct more. They were able to get the health care bill through. They were able to get the stimulus through. They were able to get the financial reform through. These were all major pieces of legislation, and if I would have had enough votes to stop them, I would have.''
Mr. McConnell said, though, that the Democratic victories would come at a price, predicting that the party's decision to push sweeping measures in the face of public opposition smacked of arrogance and ''is sowing the seeds of their potential downfall.''
It is true that Democrats are struggling to translate their accomplishments into popular support, and the difficulty of doing so is perplexing them.
During a luncheon in early August with select Democratic senators in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, President Obama gave voice to that sentiment. He told his guests, according to lawmakers, that Democrats were winning and that critics within the party were wrongly focused on ''what didn't happen rather than what we have accomplished.''
Democrats offer several rationales for why they are not breaking through with their legislative successes. They note that some of the chief benefits of the health care law and the overhaul of the financial industry, for instance, will not be felt for years. And they say that a news media environment that thrives on conflict makes it harder to get out their message about constructive achievements. Most important, they say, difficult economic times produce a disgruntled public.
''People are sour now,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate. ''Times are bad, and people are worried about the future. So they say, all these things are good, but are they making my life better?''
Democrats say they are not done for the year, though they have limited time to continue legislating in September before breaking in October for the final rush to the elections. They still intend to push a package of small-business tax incentives and other efforts to create jobs, and could consider a major food safety bill. Efforts at stimulating employment will no doubt continue to dominate in the 112th Congress, which begins in 2011, no matter what happens in the elections.
Eventually, Democrats hope, Americans will come to appreciate what took place during the 111th Congress.
''History will judge accordingly,'' said Mr. Dodd, who is retiring after 36 years in Congress at the end of this session. ''And I think it will serve us well.''

 BODY:
THE NEWS Worries that the fragile recovery was faltering sent stock markets around the world sharply lower and prompted the Federal Reserve to buy government securities to keep interest rates low. 
BEHIND THE NEWS The Fed, led by Ben S. Bernanke, has revised its earlier, more optimistic outlook. Britain and China cut their forecasts for growth, and the Dow Jones industrial average slid about 3 percent for the week as nervous investors looked for safe bets. One bright spot was austerity-minded Germany, posting its best quarterly performance since reunification.
THE NEWS Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a Democrat appointed to his seat last year, survived a primary challenge in a race seen as a gauge of the strength of the national Democratic establishment ahead of midterm elections.
BEHIND THE NEWS Some pundits called the Colorado primary a potential harbinger of the national mood, but there was no broad embrace of incumbency. Tea Party-backed candidates for governor and the Senate beat more established Republicans in Colorado. Even Mr. Bennet vowed to reach out to voters ''fed up with Washington,'' where he spends most workdays.
THE NEWS An ambitious military offensive aimed at showcasing Afghanistan's military capability instead became a debacle as Taliban fighters battered a battalion of Afghan troops in a remote eastern part of the country.
BEHIND THE NEWS The fighting was so fierce that NATO sent rescue teams, and the Red Cross was unable for days to reach the battlefield in Laghman Province. It was part of worsening insurgent violence in many parts of the country, throwing into doubt Afghanistan's ability to hold fair parliamentary elections in little more than a month to shore up the government's legitimacy.
THE NEWS The world's two largest automakers basked in welcome developments: General Motors announced that it had turned a $1.3 billion profit and federal regulators declared that they had found no evidence of faulty electronics in dozens of Toyota crashes that prompted massive recalls.
BEHIND THE NEWS After requiring a huge government bailout to survive, G.M. can now portray itself as standing on firmer financial footing in a public stock offering to help it repay taxpayers. The findings on Toyota suggested that many incidents of sudden acceleration could have been driver error.
THE NEWS In Major League Baseball, a racial disparity between the proportion of minority coaches at first base and those in the more prestigious third-base spot has been growing, according to an analysis by The New York Times.
BEHIND THE NEWS The gap is meaningful because third-base coaches earn more and often use the job as a springboard to a managerial position. Despite baseball's commitments to diversity, only 23 percent of third-base coaches are members of minorities, compared with 67 percent of first-base coaches. As a whole, 40 percent of major-leaguers are black, Hispanic or Asian.

HEADLINE: U.S. Extends a Hand To Rescue Pakistanis And Reclaim Its Image

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT; Reporting was contributed by Salmon Masood from Islamabad, Pakistan, Neil MacFarquhar from the United Nations, and Thom Shanker from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As the Obama administration continues to add to the aid package for flood-stricken Pakistan -- already the largest humanitarian response from any single country -- officials acknowledge that they are seeking to use the efforts to burnish the United States' dismal image there.
Administration officials say their top priority is providing much-needed help to a pivotal regional ally in the fight against Al Qaeda. But when senior officials from the White House, State Department, Pentagon and Agency for International Development hold their daily conference calls to coordinate American assistance, they are also strategizing about how that aid could help improve long-term relations with Pakistan.
According to a survey conducted last month by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, 68 percent of Pakistanis have an unfavorable view of the United States. American officials hope that images of Navy and Marine Corps helicopters ferrying supplies and plucking people from rain-swollen rivers will at least begin to counteract the bad will generated by American drone strikes against militants in Pakistan. Many Pakistanis blame the strikes for a devastating series of insurgent attacks in Pakistan. 
''If we do the right thing, it will be good not only for the people whose lives we save but for the U.S. image in Pakistan,'' Richard C. Holbrooke, the administration's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said Thursday on the PBS program ''The Charlie Rose Show.''
''The people of Pakistan will see that when the crisis hits,'' Mr. Holbrooke continued, ''it's not the Chinese. It's not the Iranians. It's not other countries. It's not the E.U. It's the U.S. that always leads.''
American officials say they also hope to build greater trust with the Pakistani military, which has become increasingly wary that President Obama plans to withdraw American troops quickly from neighboring Afghanistan, leaving the Pakistanis to deal with the consequences.
The flooding, which has swamped a fifth of the country and killed at least 1,384 people, according to Pakistani government figures, has led to a sizable and high-level American response, including $76 million in donations.
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates sent 19 more helicopters last week to replace six aircraft on loan from the military campaign in Afghanistan, and he invoked Mr. Obama's personal directive to ''lean forward'' in providing assistance. American aircraft have rescued more than 4,000 people since Aug. 5.
The Pentagon announced Friday that ships carrying more relief supplies and helicopters had left the East Coast and would arrive in the waters off Pakistan in late September.
How much credit the United States will receive in the eyes of the Pakistanis is not clear. Some of the aid has been channeled through Pakistani and international groups because the government did not want to be associated with the unpopular Americans.
But the magnitude of the disaster, which the government says has now driven 20 million people from their homes, may be changing those calculations and, the Americans hope, breaking down that taboo.
The American response is putting to a practical test Mr. Obama's strategy to engage Pakistan as a strategic partner on multiple levels, including economic development, counterinsurgency, law enforcement and judicial reforms, and intelligence sharing.
It comes as the American ally in that effort, President Asif Ali Zardari, is facing withering criticism at home for paying a state visit to France and Britain during the flooding, the worst in Pakistan's history.
''This is a country where we have an enormous interest in their going after the Taliban and other extremist jihadi groups,'' said Mark L. Schneider, a senior vice president at the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization that focuses on conflict resolution. ''If this kind of activity supports the Pakistani government and people supporting the Pakistani government, it's all to the good.''
Some experts on the region had recently warned that public resentment of the government generated by the floods could wear away public support for the military campaign against militants, integral to American goals in the region. Those worries only deepened as hard-line Islamist charities rushed to fill the void in humanitarian aid left by the government's slow and chaotic response.
Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who leads the Foreign Relations Committee, said Friday that he would visit Pakistan this week to assess the damage and whether the United States needed to rethink how $7.5 billion in long-term, nonmilitary aid to Pakistan would be spent as a result of the flooding.
American officials say they are trying to rekindle the same good will generated five years ago when the United States military played a major role in responding to an earthquake in Kashmir in 2005 that killed 75,000 people.
Many of the same American and Pakistani leaders who worked together during that crisis have reunited in this calamity, including Nadeem Ahmad, a retired Pakistani lieutenant general, and Vice Adm. Michael A. LeFever, the senior American officer in Pakistan. But American officials warn that the glow from the earthquake assistance faded quickly without more enduring development programs.
''LeFever clearly understands the P.R. value of flood assistance, but he also knows that absent other high-profile public diplomacy efforts, the half-life of any improvement to Pakistani impressions of the U.S. will be short,'' said John K. Wood, a retired Army colonel who was senior director for Afghanistan on the National Security Council in the Bush and Obama administrations.
The American aid drawn from giant warehouses in Dubai and in Pisa, Italy, includes 500,000 halal meals, 12 prefabricated bridges to help replace the hundreds that have washed away, 14 rescue boats, and six large-scale water-filtration systems. Last week Pakistan submitted a several-page request for additional supplies, including more boats and bridges, a senior Defense Department official said.
''The U.S. has been forthcoming on providing what we need,'' said Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States.
Still, the United States is aware that the relief effort could backfire, or at least include some negatives. Mr. Gates said relief would be paced according to Pakistan's request, in part to avoid any perception that the United States is running the relief effort.
The United States will also have to be mindful of how the Pakistani public perceives what will be a growing American military presence in country, though largely restricted to an isolated military base. By the end of this week, when the last of the 19 helicopters begin rescue and aid missions in the Swat Valley, about 250 American troops will be operating with Pakistani troops.
It remains difficult to calculate the long-term effects of the floods on America's goals in the country, which include focusing the Pakistani government on fighting the militants that threaten it and use Pakistan as a base to attack NATO forces in Afghanistan.
It has been difficult to assess, for instance, how far the flooding has set back reconstruction efforts in the Swat Valley. The rebuilding is considered crucial to keeping the area from falling back under the influence of militants the government drove out in an offensive last year.
The scale of the flooding is also demanding a greater role from the Pakistani military, which in turn leaves some American military officials concerned that the army's counterinsurgency campaign could falter in the northwest border regions.
Mr. Gates told reporters last week that the Pakistani military had not been expected to launch any new offensives against militants in the short term, and he said it remained to be seen whether the flood would have a significant impact on the Pakistani government's campaign against extremists.
''Clearly, they're going to have to divert some troops, and already have, in trying to deal with the flooding,'' Mr. Gates said.

HEADLINE: With Keepers Obsolete, Lighthouse Duties Fall To New Set of Stewards

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
ST. HELENA ISLAND, Mich. -- MaryAnn Moore and Pan Godchaux had eager smiles and the to-do list ready when their guests arrived for a four-day stay. ''Sweep sidewalks and dock,'' it said. ''Wash tower windows. Pump water.''
And for anyone feeling really generous, two big requests were scrawled on a kitchen whiteboard: a boat ''that doesn't leak'' and ''$1,000,000.''
The women are keepers of a lighthouse, nine miles from the nearest town, on an uninhabited island at the treacherous convergence of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. For more than 10 years, volunteer keepers have worked to restore the 137-year-old station, and in the summer they count on vacationing friends and preservation-minded Michiganders to pitch in. 
''We want to build ownership and for people to feel like, 'This is our lighthouse,' '' said Ms. Moore, 63, a former teacher and full-time volunteer with the Great Lakes Lighthouse Keepers Association, a nonprofit group. ''I want to do what it takes to keep it alive.''
It takes a lot.
As GPS units and the automation of navigational tools have rendered traditional lighthouse keepers obsolete, the government has been decommissioning the properties it owns, nearly 50 over the last 10 years, and transferring ownership to new stewards at no cost, preferably nonprofit groups. When it cannot find a proper caretaker, the properties are auctioned to the highest bidder, which has happened 15 times.
Increasingly, people like Ms. Moore -- history buffs and preservationists, youth groups and investors -- are stepping up to do what the Coast Guard and old men of the sea have done for ages: tend to the nation's lighthouses.
Three were declared excess just last month in Michigan. There are seven available in Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Wisconsin, and five more are up for auction.
The catch is that new owners must maintain the properties to historic standards. And during a recession, with grants and donations ever harder to come by, the lighthouses have hit hard times, particularly in Michigan, a struggling state with about 113 lighthouses -- more than any other state.
''I'm telling you this, you cannot restore a lighthouse with bake sales,'' said Scott L. Hollman, 69, who won the Granite Island Light Station in Lake Superior at public auction for $86,000 about 10 years ago, somewhat unaware of what he was getting into. ''I can never get over the fact that they built this whole darn thing in one summer, and it took me two-and-a-half summers to repair it, with all the materials and technology we have today.''
Restoring a lighthouse is not easy. Just after Mr. Hollman installed a custom-designed door, high winds blew through and shredded it. It took months to make a new one. ''That little storm cost me 2,500 bucks,'' he said. ''You want to do these things once and say it is restored and done. In fact, you do things over and over again.''
Lighthouses even have their budding collectors. Michael L. Gabriel, 56, a lawyer in the San Francisco Bay area, bought two deteriorating lighthouses at auction: one, in Chesapeake Bay, for $100,000, the other, in Delaware Bay, for $200,000. ''The alternative was doing nothing and losing them to the point where they're not salvageable,'' he said.
Once a lighthouse is rescued from abandonment, the question for owners becomes ''Now what?'' Mr. Gabriel hopes to use one of the stations as a summer house, with the other, perhaps, catering to tourists.
''I've looked into doing a microbrewery, a hamburger joint, just little stuff to bring in enough money to cover the year-to-year maintenance,'' he said.
Some of the new keepers are working hard just to keep the lights on. (Or in the case of St. Helena Island, which is not wired for electricity, the volunteers are working to keep the candles lighted and the flashlights on.)
Abandoned in 1922, the St. Helena Island lighthouse has been a $1.3 million job so far, paid for mostly with donations and grants. In addition to the tower, the volunteers have restored the keeper's and assistant keeper's quarters, a boathouse and a dock. Materials and transportation to the island are the greatest expenses.
Ms. Moore, Ms. Godchaux and other leaders of the keepers association organize four-night stays at the compound for visitors who want to donate their time while living in the rustic keepers' quarters. Last week, a quilters' group from the Grand Rapids area took up residence and made a donation for their meals and transportation, as most visitors do.
Scrubbing pots in an outdoor bucket, one of the quilters, Kathy Cavanaugh, a bank teller, said: ''This is a dream come true. My favorite part is treating this just like home. I really want to live the lifestyle.''
That included hauling water from a hand-pump well, using a pit latrine in the woods and trying not to be too concerned about spiders and snakes.
The full-time keepers, Ms. Moore and Ms. Godchaux, have no navigational duties other than pointing out freighters in the Straits of Mackinac, a heavily trafficked shipping lane, to the guests. But they regularly paint, chop wood, clear brush and keep the tower clean. The Coast Guard retains legal access to the light, which still pulses at night, operated by solar power and automatic sensors. But the cast-iron stairs need to be scrubbed and painted, and the keepers' quarters need a new roof.
''At some point, you could easily ask, 'What the heck am I doing this for?' '' said Dick Moehl, 78, president of the Great Lakes Lighthouse Keepers Association. ''It is a mental and physical challenge.''
The association took over a second lighthouse from the government in 2004 and is in the process of restoring it, too.
''What we need to do is find a way to make things like this work in modern times,'' said Terry Pepper, the group's executive director. ''We still need lighthouses.''
Indeed, many of the decommissioned properties in critical areas have working beacons because boating electronics sometimes fail. But Mr. Pepper was referring to an emotional need as well.
Jennifer Radcliff, president of the Michigan Lighthouse Fund, a nonprofit organization set up to help with restorations, said, ''People need to know where their place is, and lighthouses acknowledge a sense of place that resonates in a real primal way.''
The St. Helena Island Light Station will close for the long Upper Midwest winter at the end of the month. The island will be uninhabited until Ms. Moore and Ms. Godchaux return next May to open the shutters and greet volunteers, some of whom have already made up their minds to come back.
''Next year's a given,'' said Ms. Cavanaugh, the bank teller, outfitted, for kicks, in a bonnet and long prairie dress. ''Keepers need help. Don't have to ask me twice.''

HEADLINE: Wind vs. Coal: The Fight for a Mountaintop

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.; Ben Werschkul contributed reporting from Whitesville, W.Va.

 BODY:
ROCK CREEK, W.Va.
LORELEI SCARBRO'S husband, Kenneth, an underground coal miner for more than 30 years, is buried in a small family cemetery near her property here at the base of Coal River Mountain. The headstone is engraved with two roosters facing off, their feathers ruffled. Kenneth, who loved cockfighting, died in 1999, and, Ms. Scarbro says, he would have hated seeing the tops of mountains lopped off with explosives and heavy machinery by mining companies searching for coal.
Critics say the practice, known as ''mountaintop removal mining,'' is as devastating to the local environment as it is economically efficient for coal companies, one of which is poised to begin carving up Coal River Mountain. And that has Ms. Scarbro and other residents of western Raleigh County in a face-off of their own.
Their goal is to save the mountain, and they intend to do so with a wind farm. At least one study has shown that a wind project could be a feasible alternative to coal mining here, although the coal industry's control over the land and the uncertain and often tenuous financial prospects of wind generation appear to make it unlikely to be pursued. That, residents say, would be a mistake. 
''If we don't stop this,'' Ms. Scarbro says, adjusting the flowers on her husband's grave, ''one day we'll be standing on a big pile of rock and debris, and we'll be asking, 'What do we do now?' ''
For many renewable-energy advocates outside the region, the struggle at Coal River Mountain has become emblematic of an effort across the country to find alternatives to fossil fuels. They have lent money, expertise and high-profile celebrities like Daryl Hannah and James Hansen, the NASA climate scientist, to help residents advance their case for wind power and to make it a test case for others pursuing similar projects nationwide.
The mountain, which is privately owned and leased to coal interests, is also one of the last intact mountaintops in a region whose contours have otherwise been irreversibly altered by extreme surface-mining techniques. Preserving its peaks for a wind farm, plan advocates say, could provide needed job diversification for impoverished towns that otherwise live or die by the fortunes of coal.
Don L. Blankenship, the chief executive of Massey Energy, the largest coal company in West Virginia and the one planning to cut into Coal River Mountain's peaks, has repeatedly called assertions of long- and short-term environmental damage exaggerated.
''There are a lot of misstatements out there,'' Mr. Blankenship says. ''I don't find the environmental damage to be nearly what people say they find it to be, and we're struggling with whether the true objective of all these regulations is to protect the environment, or whether it's simply to stop the mining of coal.''
While the odds remain slim that wind power will replace coal mining here, proponents say that changes in state and federal mining regulations could tilt things in their favor.
''We want to make it economically unfeasible to do mountaintop mining,'' Ms. Scarbro says.
COAL mining of all kinds has long played a vital role in the West Virginia economy, and the state still sits on more than 30 billion tons of coal reserves, according to federal estimates. It produced 158 million tons in 2008, second only to Wyoming, at 468 million. And with roughly half of the United States' electricity derived from coal-fired power plants, the incentive to keep digging here is strong -- particularly in the handful of counties in the southwest corner of the state, where a majority of its 20,000 coal-industry jobs are concentrated.
Still, that number is down substantially from a peak of 130,000 jobs in the 1940s, and the decrease suggests less about production than about the rise of mechanized surface mining, including mountaintop removal. The resulting debris -- a mixture of rock, dirt and other leftovers known as ''spoil'' -- is dumped into valleys and streams below.
Hundreds of feet of elevation are sometimes removed, with equal amounts of nearby valley filled in, creating a peculiar landscape of high, wide plateaus in various stages of revegetation, encircled by the pointy, forested peaks native to the area.
Outside the industry, mountaintop removal mining has few defenders, and it has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny for its environmental impact. Mining companies, however, value it as a cost-effective way to gain access to coal deposits that otherwise couldn't be reached.
Two studies released this spring by environmental groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Appalachian Voices, used aerial and satellite analysis to document at least 500 mountaintops and roughly 1.2 million acres in four states that have been altered by mountaintop removal. The Appalachian Voices report estimated that 352,000 acres and 136 mountains have been affected in West Virginia alone.
Federal and state permits have long been granted for this type of mining, though that appears to be changing. The Environmental Protection Agency signaled this spring that it would be instructing its regional offices to raise the bar for permitting valley fills, which have been linked to increases in potentially hazardous chemicals downstream.
If the guidance is enforced, it could make mountaintop removal mining, at least as it is now practiced, all but impossible -- but that remains far from certain.
Coal industry executives and landowners, meanwhile, argue that flattened mountaintops are easier to develop for agriculture, housing, shopping centers or even wind farms.
Massey Energy's Mr. Blankenship -- whom detractors often try to portray as a Luciferian overlord of fossil fuel production-- relies on what he sees as an elementary cost-benefit analysis when discussing wind power: if you make coal mining more expensive, the cost of electric power goes up.
''If you raise the cost of a kilowatt-hour from a nickel to a quarter, then some American plant producing aluminum, or cars, or whatever, it goes out of business, because you can then put your factories in Asia, where you can get that electricity for a nickel or less,'' Mr. Blankenship says.
Ms. Scarbro sees things differently. ''While I'd be happy if no man ever had to go underground again to mine a lump of coal, I also know that we need it,'' she says. ''We need coal for steel, and we need steel to make wind turbines. But I am 100 percent against mountaintop removal mining.''
Shoving aside the coffee table in her living room, Ms. Scarbro -- the 55-year-old daughter, granddaughter, mother-in-law and widow of West Virginia coal miners -- unfolded a map depicting the three parts of Coal River Mountain that Massey plans to surface-mine. She pointed out her home on the map, near the end of a winding, forested hollow supporting walnut trees, wild ginseng and a variety of fruit trees.
The forests in this part of the state are among the most biologically diverse in the world. Although stressed by two centuries of development, including 100 years of underground coal mining, the steep ridges and valleys still support a staggeringly diverse tree canopy, dozens of herb and mushroom species, plentiful stocks of perch, trout and catfish, a variety of native and migratory birds, a veritable rainbow of salamanders as well as coyotes, deer, black bears and bobcats.
Ms. Scarbro reckons that curbing mountaintop removal, by whatever means, would not only protect some of that diversity -- and perhaps help lure more tourists -- but would also create more coal jobs, because it would make coal companies go back to more labor-intensive underground mining. That would presumably include an expansion of jobs at Coal River Mountain, which has long been mined from below.
Throw a large wind farm into the mix, Ms. Scarbro says -- and perhaps even a turbine factory -- and the coal-dependent economies around the mountain might diversify and thrive.
''The problem is, nobody here has any choices,'' Ms. Scarbro says. ''The miners doing mountaintop removal don't have any choices, because they need their jobs to provide for their families. And people like me have no choice but to fight it, because if we don't, nothing will change.''
THE idea for a wind project first surfaced in 2006, after David Orr, a professor of environmental studies at Oberlin College in Ohio, approached researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, part of the Department of Energy, about its analysis of wind potential around the country.
''We were supporting lots of groups trying to stop mountaintop removal and to do remediation at former sites,'' Professor Orr says. ''But we realized that, while that's fine, it's hard to get something done if you're always just against something. So we began looking for alternatives to mountaintop mining.''
The lab's wind resource maps showed West Virginia's potential as modest compared with that of blustery states like North Dakota and Montana. And the best wind in the state tended to be in the northeast corner, far from the southern heart of coal country.
Undeterred, Professor Orr reached out to WindLogics, a St. Paul-based company that provides wind resource assessments for utility-scale projects. Using computer modeling, WindLogics produced a detailed assessment of specific sites in West Virginia -- including Coal River Mountain -- suggesting that the winds atop some peaks even in coal country were strong and steady enough to support a wind farm.
By 2008, those models had been folded into an economic comparison between future surface mining at Coal River Mountain and the proposed placement of a 164-turbine, 328-megawatt wind farm along its spine. The analysis -- which Professor Orr, the Sierra Club and other groups helped finance on behalf of Coal River Mountain Watch, a community group in the once-bustling town of Whitesville -- found that the energy potential of the mountain's coal, and the royalties that would accrue to companies owning land there, vastly outstripped anything a wind farm could replicate, at least in the short term.
The longer view, however, seemed to argue strongly for a wind farm.
Using wind turbine tax rules established by the state in 2007, the researchers calculated that a wind farm of the size proposed for Coal River Mountain would generate $1.74 million in annual tax revenue for Raleigh County. That's roughly equal to the total coal taxes the county collected for the 2007-2008 fiscal year, according to the state auditor.
The portion of added tax revenue that would arise from surface mining Coal River Mountain was estimated at $36,000 a year for the next 17 years, at which point the resource would be exhausted. But a wind farm could keep generating revenue indefinitely for the county. It would also generate several hundred construction jobs, and several dozen permanent maintenance jobs.
Luring a turbine production plant while continuing to mine coal underground could generate more than 1,000 jobs, the report found. And Rory McIlmoil, a former member of Coal River Mountain Watch and now a project manager for the energy and climate-change practice at Downstream Strategies, which produced the economic analysis, said that despite the coal industry's protestations to the contrary, a decapitated Coal River Mountain would no longer be suitable for wind development.
''If you decrease the elevation, you decrease the wind resource,'' he said. ''There would be no more utility-scale wind up there.''
The real world, of course, presents other complications. Wind power, for example, currently cannot compete with cheap coal without substantial subsidies. And if one aim of wind development is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, even the authors of the Coal River economic study noted that there were more economical ways to do it. A 2008 study found that at some Texas wind projects, the cost of the subsidies exceeded the value of the emissions that were being offset.
Wind turbines also have environmental impacts -- including the roads needed to gain access to the mountaintops, the trees that would have to be stripped away for giant turbine footprints and the inevitable number of birds and bats that would be bludgeoned by 164 mountaintop Cuisinarts. Many communities in West Virginia -- and across the country -- have been beating back wind projects they see as a blight on wide-angle views and, with the repetitive thrum of the turning blades and their strobelike effect on daylight passing through them, psychological torture for those living nearby.
Echoing the decadelong court battles that nearly derailed a major offshore wind project off Cape Cod in Massachusetts, citizens of Greenbrier County, W.Va., represented by a group called Mountain Communities for Responsible Energy, battled a proposed wind farm there for more than five years, citing negative impacts on property values, threats to birds, and other downsides.
A United States District Court brokered a compromise in January that would allow 67 of 124 proposed turbines to proceed -- though on its Web site, the group says it remains ''convinced that massive installation of industrial wind turbines on forested ridges will create more problems than it will solve.''
DAVID POLLITT, owner of the Rowland Land Company, the largest of the property owners on Coal River Mountain, says he has nothing against wind farms in principle, but adds that he believes the technology is too expensive, too undeveloped and too rife with its own environmental objections to be viable. In any case, until mountaintop removal is banned, he says leasing his land to coal developers is simply too profitable not to do.
''Certainly if it came to a point in time where the companies we have it leased to say they don't need the surface, then we can look at alternatives,'' Mr. Pollitt says. ''And if there ever comes a point in time where they completely outlaw surface mining, we'd certainly look at alternatives. We'd look at anything that would generate income for us.''
For now, though, that's likely to remain coal, and Massey Energy has already begun blasting on one corner of Coal River Mountain.
''I do believe that people who own property, if they conduct the use of that property in a manner that doesn't bother other people and doesn't impact water and so forth in a meaningful way, have a right to the use of that property,'' says Mr. Blankenship, Massey's C.E.O. He adds that sooner or later, environmentalists, wind advocates and government regulators will drive electricity costs so high that they will see their folly.
''At some point in time, hardship or pragmatism or truth will take over, and jobs and schools and communities will become more important,'' he says.
Despite all of this, advocates for the wind facility continue to travel to Charleston, the state capital -- and to Washington.
And the cause for a wind farm here has also been taken up by a Who's Who of environmental celebrities. Ashley Judd, an opponent of mountaintop mining, has championed renewable energy development in the region. Mr. Hansen, the NASA climate scientist, joined Ms. Hannah, the actress and environmentalist, at a rally in Raleigh County last summer. They spoke to a crowd of several hundred about the ravages of mountaintop removal and the virtues of renewable energy.
Not everyone in the community agreed, and local miners and their families, who see the movement against mountaintop removal mining as a threat to their livelihoods, repeatedly shouted them down. Mr. Hansen and Ms. Hannah were among 30 people arrested after the rally, accused of blocking traffic outside a Massey preparation plant.
In Raleigh County, local officials have given a polite hearing to the Coal River wind proposal, but say they should not be made to choose between industries.
Some advocates express hope that a wealthy benefactor might someday sweep in and buy the land from Rowland, providing an avenue for wind development. Ms. Scarbro and the authors of the wind project study suggested that Gov. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia could use his administration's executive powers to rescind Massey's surface-mine permits on the mountain.
But Governor Manchin says such a move is pure fantasy. ''People believe that just because you're the governor you can do anything,'' he says. ''They think that with just a stroke of the pen I can tell them to do this or that.''
Nonetheless, in a visit to the state capital last fall, Ms. Scarbro, flanked by demonstrators holding signs reading ''Yes, Wind,'' implored him to intervene.
''What we're trying to do is find balance -- you know that,'' the governor told the protesters in an exchange captured on YouTube. ''I mean, it's tough to find balance in an extraction state.''
Ms. Scarbro, invoking West Virginia's official state nickname, replied, ''We're the Mountain State, not the extraction state.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about proposed mountaintop mining at Coal River Mountain in West Virginia referred incorrectly to a court-brokered compromise in January on a planned wind farm in Greenbrier County, W.Va. It allowed work to proceed on more than half, or 67 of 124 proposed turbines there, and allowed up to 33 others to be added later, though some at sites not in the original proposal; it did not allow just ''a small part'' of the project to proceed.

This mining includes ''mountaintop removal mining,'' an economically efficient method in which hundreds of feet of elevation are blasted off and dumped into adjacent valleys. Coal River Mountain, in southwestern West Virginia, is slated for such mining. But some local residents and some environmental groups, seeking to save the mountain, have proposed a wind farm on it instead. They say it could provide longer-lasting economic benefits than the mountain's finite supply of coal, while diversifying the state's employment base.
CHARTS: Mining More Coal, but With Fewer Miners: West Virginia produces more coal now than it did a few decades ago, with the growth coming mostly from surface mining. But the number of miners employed there plunged as the industry became more efficient. In the most recent decade, however, coal has become harder to extract, so employment has edged higher and productivity has decreased, making surface mining even more appealing to coal companies.

HEADLINE: 'Our Job Is Not Finished,' President Tells Gulf Coast

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
PANAMA CITY, Fla. -- President Obama on Saturday called the capping of the well that has spewed tens of millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico ''an important milestone,'' but vowed to maintain an intense government response until the environment is cleaned up and businesses and communities are made whole.
''Today, the well is capped, oil is no longer flowing into the gulf, and it has not been flowing for a month,'' Mr. Obama said at a Coast Guard district station here, with cutters behind him and his wife, Michelle. ''But I'm here to tell you that our job is not finished, and we are not going anywhere until it is.'' 
The Obamas and their daughter Sasha -- their older daughter, Malia, is away at camp -- arrived here on Saturday morning, along with their dog, Bo, for a one-night stay in a summer in which their leisure pursuits have kicked up national confusion over what is appropriate for an American president and his family.
The trip, intended by the White House to spotlight the oil-stricken Gulf Coast as a recreational venue, was planned after Mr. Obama and his wife urged Americans to vacation here, only to make their own vacation plans for Maine and Martha's Vineyard.
(And that was before Mrs. Obama and Sasha jetted off to the coast of Spain for a mother-daughter trip that has been criticized as too luxurious during a recession.)
Perhaps metaphorically for a president who has been through a rough patch, the skies here were gray and rainy when Air Force One landed -- not an especially appealing backdrop for Mr. Obama, who had intended to encourage vacationers to sample the gulf seafood and beaches. But by the time the president spoke, the sun had broken through, and he made his pitch.
''Beaches all along the Gulf Coast are clean, safe and open for business,'' Mr. Obama said. He said he wanted to let ''fellow Americans know that they should come on down here,'' adding, ''Not just to support the region, but also because it's a beautiful place to visit.''
For the president, and to a lesser extent for Mrs. Obama, the trip is a working vacation. As soon as Air Force One touched down Saturday morning, the first couple went to the Coast Guard headquarters for a round-table discussion with local business leaders and government officials, including a hotel owner and a fishing boat captain who spoke of declining revenues in the months since the spill.
''I'm going to spend most of my time, Michelle is going to spend most of her time, listening and getting suggestions and recommendations from you,'' the president told them.
The trip was a somewhat delicate one for Mr. Obama. Although he wants to take credit for the government response and the capping of the well, he can ill afford to declare ''mission accomplished.'' In his remarks, the president vowed to maintain the government's focus on removing any oil that might surface; testing fisheries and reopening waters for fishing as soon as tests show they are safe; leaning on BP to quickly process claims; and developing a long-term restoration plan for the gulf.
The brief speech concluded the working portion of the trip; the big question on Saturday morning here was what the Obamas would do for fun. In the afternoon, the family had lunch at Lime's Bayside Bar & Grill at the end of a long pier. Later they played miniature golf.
But Mr. Obama faced a presidential dilemma: whether to go swimming. To stay out of the water would have suggested it was unsafe, undercutting the message of his trip. To take the plunge might have resulted in photographs of him shirtless, causing a controversy like the one that dogged him in 2008 after he went bodysurfing in Hawaii.
The White House solved the problem by allowing only its own photographer to take pictures of the president swimming. The photo it released showed Mr. Obama enjoying the surf -- from the neck up.
The Panama City visit is short, planned for just 27 hours; the family expected to return to Washington on Sunday evening, and on Monday Mr. Obama will set off for a three-day cross-country fund-raising swing.
When he returns, he will head to Massachusetts for his real vacation: 10 days on Martha's Vineyard.

HEADLINE: In This Play, One Role Is Enough

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
MEET Brad Miller, a Democratic representative from North Carolina who was elected to Congress in 2002, talks straight and understands how big banks can put consumers at peril.
He is worth getting to know, not only because of his deep concern about the foreclosure epidemic, but also because he has made a compelling recommendation to level an exceedingly tilted playing field in mortgage finance.
Depending upon your perspective, Mr. Miller is either the right man in the right place on Capitol Hill -- if you're a consumer -- or a threat to the status quo. 
A lawyer who worked on consumer protection issues in North Carolina, Mr. Miller is not new to battling banks. In March 2009, along with Representative William D. Delahunt, a Democrat from Massachusetts, he proposed the creation of an independent consumer agency; it became a part of the recent financial overhaul. This past March, Mr. Miller introduced a bill that would eliminate one of the most pernicious conflicts of interest in banking today: the dueling roles played by the big mortgage servicers.
These companies -- the biggest are Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citibank -- operate as the back office for the mortgage lending industry. In good times, their tasks are fairly simple: they take in monthly mortgage payments and distribute them to whoever owns the loans. In many cases, large institutions like pension funds or mutual funds own the mortgages, and servicers are obligated to act in their interests at all times.
When borrowers are defaulting in droves, as they are now, loan servicing becomes much more complex and laborious. Servicers must chase delinquent borrowers for payments and otherwise manage these uneasy relationships, possibly into foreclosure.
So where does the conflict of interest lie? Often, the same bank that services a primary mortgage owned by another institution also owns a second mortgage or home equity line of credit on the same property. When that borrower has trouble meeting both payments, the servicer has an interest in making sure that amounts owed on the second lien, which it owns, continue to be paid even if the first loan, which it has no interest in, slides into delinquency. About two-thirds of primary mortgages are serviced by banks who do not own them but hold the accompanying seconds.
This conflict is a crucial reason that the government's loan modification program has been so woefully ineffective. The Treasury Department never forced the second-lien holders who service troubled primary mortgages to reduce the amount they are owed by borrowers, even though such a move would give them a better shot at keeping their homes.
Of course, the big banks that hold these second liens have little interest in letting borrowers write them off entirely, or in part, because the institutions would have to absorb huge losses on them. As long as the borrower is eking out payments on the second liens, the banks that own them can pretend that they are performing and keep recording them at high values on their books.
The top four banks hold approximately $450 billion in second liens that are supposed to take a backseat to the investors who hold the primary mortgages. But because of the front-seat role big banks play as servicers, they are in a position to put their interests first.
''Unless we can make servicers modify mortgages through bankruptcy or eminent domain, the servicers are not going to reduce principal,'' Mr. Miller, 57, said in a recent interview. ''Their stance does seem largely driven by accounting concerns -- they are trying to maintain the fiction that the mortgages are worth the value they are carrying them at on their books.''
Enter Mr. Miller's bill, the Mortgage Servicing Conflict of Interest Elimination Act. It bars servicers of first loans they do not own from holding any other mortgages on the same property.
Mr. Miller's bill has not gained much attention since it was introduced in March. But it ought to, because the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law is utterly silent on servicer conflicts.
The bill would give these institutions a reasonable amount of time to divest either their servicing businesses or their interests in home mortgages, Mr. Miller said. A likely outcome is that the four biggest banks would spin off their mortgage servicing operations. This would not only resolve the conflict between loan servicers and investors, but it would also result in smaller, less complex banks, he said. That is surely a major benefit.
Another is that Mr. Miller's law, if enacted, would break up the logjam now thwarting mortgage modifications. ''We must reinvent our mortgage finance system,'' he said. ''This is a huge part of our economy, and we cannot have a healthy recovery with the housing sector as sick as it is.''
A member of the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Miller concedes that he did not see the financial crisis coming. But he said that several years ago he became aware that increasingly poisonous mortgages were being peddled to consumers.
''These mortgages were not designed to increase homeownership; they were designed to trap people in debt and strip the equity in their home as home prices appreciated,'' Mr. Miller said. ''For the financial industry, that increasing wealth from middle-class homeowners was an attractive target; if they could trap families in a cycle of borrowing every three years or so, then a lot of increased wealth in their homes would end up in the financial sector rather than with those families.''
Mr. Miller recognizes that his is an uphill climb because the big banks have many friends in high places across Washington. ''Americans have come away from this persuaded that everything has been done to help the banks and not to help them,'' he said. ''And in a democracy, that's a real problem.''
Still, he said he has recently noted a slight shift in the balance of power. ''I've seen the banks going from losing no fights to losing a few fights,'' he said. ''What I've found is the more fights we pick, the more success we have.''
Here's to more fights, then. Many more.

HEADLINE: A Secret Assault on Terror Widens on Two Continents

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE, MARK MAZZETTI and ROBERT F. WORTH; Muhammad al-Ahmadi contributed reporting from Yemen.

 BODY:
This article is by Scott Shane, Mark Mazzetti and Robert F. Worth.
WASHINGTON -- At first, the news from Yemen on May 25 sounded like a modest victory in the campaign against terrorists: an airstrike had hit a group suspected of being operatives for Al Qaeda in the remote desert of Marib Province, birthplace of the legendary queen of Sheba.
But the strike, it turned out, had also killed the province's deputy governor, a respected local leader who Yemeni officials said had been trying to talk Qaeda members into giving up their fight. Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, accepted responsibility for the death and paid blood money to the offended tribes.
The strike, though, was not the work of Mr. Saleh's decrepit Soviet-era air force. It was a secret mission by the United States military, according to American officials, at least the fourth such assault on Al Qaeda in the arid mountains and deserts of Yemen since December. 
The attack offered a glimpse of the Obama administration's shadow war against Al Qaeda and its allies. In roughly a dozen countries -- from the deserts of North Africa, to the mountains of Pakistan, to former Soviet republics crippled by ethnic and religious strife -- the United States has significantly increased military and intelligence operations, pursuing the enemy using robotic drones and commando teams, paying contractors to spy and training local operatives to chase terrorists.
The White House has intensified the Central Intelligence Agency's drone missile campaign in Pakistan, approved raids against Qaeda operatives in Somalia and launched clandestine operations from Kenya. The administration has worked with European allies to dismantle terrorist groups in North Africa, efforts that include a recent French and Mauritanian strike near the border between Mauritania and Mali. And the Pentagon tapped a network of private contractors to gather intelligence about things like militant hide-outs in Pakistan and the location of an American soldier currently in Taliban hands.
While the stealth war began in the Bush administration, it has expanded under President Obama, who rose to prominence in part for his early opposition to the invasion of Iraq. Virtually none of the newly aggressive steps undertaken by the United States government have been publicly acknowledged. In contrast with the troop buildup in Afghanistan, which came after months of robust debate, for example, the American military campaign in Yemen began without notice in December and has never been officially confirmed.
Obama administration officials point to the benefits of bringing the fight against Al Qaeda and other militants into the shadows. Afghanistan and Iraq, they said, have sobered American politicians and voters about the staggering costs of big wars that topple governments, require years of occupation and can be a catalyst for further radicalization throughout the Muslim world.
Instead of ''the hammer,'' in the words of John O. Brennan, President Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, America will rely on the ''scalpel.'' In a speech in May, Mr. Brennan, an architect of the White House strategy, used this analogy while pledging a ''multigenerational'' campaign against Al Qaeda and its extremist affiliates.
Yet such wars come with many risks: the potential for botched operations that fuel anti-American rage; a blurring of the lines between soldiers and spies that could put troops at risk of being denied Geneva Convention protections; a weakening of the Congressional oversight system put in place to prevent abuses by America's secret operatives; and a reliance on authoritarian foreign leaders and surrogates with sometimes murky loyalties.
The May strike in Yemen, for example, provoked a revenge attack on an oil pipeline by local tribesmen and produced a propaganda bonanza for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. It also left President Saleh privately furious about the death of the provincial official, Jabir al-Shabwani, and scrambling to prevent an anti-American backlash, according to Yemeni officials.
The administration's demands have accelerated a transformation of the C.I.A. into a paramilitary organization as much as a spying agency, which some critics worry could lower the threshold for future quasi-military operations. In Pakistan's mountains, the agency had broadened its drone campaign beyond selective strikes against Qaeda leaders and now regularly obliterates suspected enemy compounds and logistics convoys, just as the military would grind down an enemy force.
For its part, the Pentagon is becoming more like the C.I.A. Across the Middle East and elsewhere, Special Operations troops under secret ''Execute Orders'' have conducted spying missions that were once the preserve of civilian intelligence agencies. With code names like Eager Pawn and Indigo Spade, such programs typically operate with even less transparency and Congressional oversight than traditional covert actions by the C.I.A.
And, as American counterterrorism operations spread beyond war zones into territory hostile to the military, private contractors have taken on a prominent role, raising concerns that the United States has outsourced some of its most important missions to a sometimes unaccountable private army.
A Proving Ground
Yemen is a testing ground for the ''scalpel'' approach Mr. Brennan endorses. Administration officials warn of the growing strength of Al Qaeda's affiliate there, citing as evidence its attempt on Dec. 25 to blow up a trans-Atlantic jetliner using a young Nigerian operative. Some American officials believe that militants in Yemen could now pose an even greater threat than Al Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan.
The officials said that they have benefited from the Yemeni government's new resolve to fight Al Qaeda and that the American strikes -- carried out with cruise missiles and Harrier fighter jets -- had been approved by Yemen's leaders. The strikes, administration officials say, have killed dozens of militants suspected of plotting future attacks. The Pentagon and the C.I.A. have quietly bulked up the number of their operatives at the embassy in Sana, the Yemeni capital, over the past year.
''Where we want to get is to much more small scale, preferably locally driven operations,'' said Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington, who serves on the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees.
''For the first time in our history, an entity has declared a covert war against us,'' Mr. Smith said, referring to Al Qaeda. ''And we are using similar elements of American power to respond to that covert war.''
Some security experts draw parallels to the cold war, when the United States drew heavily on covert operations as it fought a series of proxy battles with the Soviet Union.
And some of the central players of those days have returned to take on supporting roles in the shadow war. Michael G. Vickers, who helped run the C.I.A.'s campaign to funnel guns and money to the Afghanistan mujahedeen in the 1980s and was featured in the book and movie ''Charlie Wilson's War,'' is now the top Pentagon official overseeing Special Operations troops around the globe. Duane R. Clarridge, a profane former C.I.A. officer who ran operations in Central America and was indicted in the Iran-contra scandal, turned up this year helping run a Pentagon-financed private spying operation in Pakistan.
In pursuing this strategy, the White House is benefiting from a unique political landscape. Republican lawmakers have been unwilling to take Mr. Obama to task for aggressively hunting terrorists, and many Democrats seem eager to embrace any move away from the long, costly wars begun by the Bush administration.
Still, it has astonished some old hands of the military and intelligence establishment. Jack Devine, a former top C.I.A. clandestine officer who helped run the covert war against the Soviet Army in Afghanistan in the 1980s, said his record showed that he was ''not exactly a cream puff'' when it came to advocating secret operations.
But he warned that the safeguards introduced after Congressional investigations into clandestine wars of the past -- from C.I.A. assassination attempts to the Iran-contra affair, in which money from secret arms dealings with Iran was funneled to right-wing rebels in Nicaragua known as the contras -- were beginning to be weakened. ''We got the covert action programs under well-defined rules after we had made mistakes and learned from them,'' he said. ''Now, we're coming up with a new model, and I'm concerned there are not clear rules.''
Cooperation and Control
The initial American strike in Yemen came on Dec. 17, hitting what was believed to be a Qaeda training camp in Abyan Province, in the southern part of the country. The first report from the Yemeni government said that its air force had killed ''around 34'' Qaeda fighters there, and that others had been captured elsewhere in coordinated ground operations.
The next day, Mr. Obama called President Saleh to thank him for his cooperation and pledge continuing American support. Mr. Saleh's approval for the strike -- rushed because of intelligence reports that Qaeda suicide bombers might be headed to Sana -- was the culmination of administration efforts to win him over, including visits by Mr. Brennan and Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the commander of military operations in the Middle East.
The accounts of the American strikes in Yemen, which include many details that have not previously been reported, are based on interviews with American and Yemeni officials who requested anonymity because the military campaign in Yemen is classified, as well as documents from Yemeni investigators.
As word of the Dec. 17 attack filtered out, a very mixed picture emerged. The Yemeni press quickly identified the United States as responsible for the strike. Qaeda members seized on video of dead children and joined a protest rally a few days later, broadcast by Al Jazeera, in which a speaker shouldering an AK-47 rifle appealed to Yemeni counterterrorism troops.
''Soldiers, you should know we do not want to fight you,'' the Qaeda operative, standing amid angry Yemenis, declared. ''There is no problem between you and us. The problem is between us and America and its agents. Beware taking the side of America!''
A Navy ship offshore had fired the weapon in the attack, a cruise missile loaded with cluster bombs, according to a report by Amnesty International. Unlike conventional bombs, cluster bombs disperse small munitions, some of which do not immediately explode, increasing the likelihood of civilian causalities. The use of cluster munitions, later documented by Amnesty, was condemned by human rights groups.
An inquiry by the Yemeni Parliament found that the strike had killed at least 41 members of two families living near the makeshift Qaeda camp. Three more civilians were killed and nine were wounded four days later when they stepped on unexploded munitions from the strike, the inquiry found.
American officials cited strained resources for decisions about some of the Yemen strikes. With the C.I.A.'s armed drones tied up with the bombing campaign in Pakistan, the officials said, cruise missiles were all that was available at the time. Drones are favored by the White House for clandestine strikes because they can linger over targets for hours or days before unleashing Hellfire missiles, reducing the risk that women, children or other noncombatants will fall victim.
The Yemen operation has raised a broader question: who should be running the shadow war? White House officials are debating whether the C.I.A. should take over the Yemen campaign as a ''covert action,'' which would allow the United States to carry out operations even without the approval of Yemen's government. By law, covert action programs require presidential authorization and formal notification to the Congressional intelligence committees. No such requirements apply to the military's so-called Special Access Programs, like the Yemen strikes.
Obama administration officials defend their efforts in Yemen. The strikes have been ''conducted very methodically,'' and claims of innocent civilians being killed are ''very much exaggerated,'' said a senior counterterrorism official. He added that comparing the nascent Yemen campaign with American drone strikes in Pakistan was unfair, since the United States has had a decade to build an intelligence network in Pakistan that feeds the drone program.
In Yemen, officials said, there is a dearth of solid intelligence about Qaeda operations. ''It will take time to develop and grow that capability,'' the senior official said.
On Dec. 24, another cruise missile struck in a remote valley called Rafadh, about 400 miles southeast of the Yemeni capital and two hours from the nearest paved road. The Yemeni authorities said the strike killed dozens of Qaeda operatives, including the leader of the Qaeda branch in Yemen, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, and his Saudi deputy, Said Ali al-Shihri. But officials later acknowledged that neither man was hit, and local witnesses say the missile killed five low-level Qaeda members.
The next known American strike, on March 14, was more successful, killing a Qaeda operative named Jamil al-Anbari and possibly another militant. Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch acknowledged Mr. Anbari's death. On June 19, the group retaliated with a lethal attack on a government security compound in Aden that left 11 people dead and said the ''brigade of the martyr Jamil al-Anbari'' carried it out.
In part, the spotty record of the Yemen airstrikes may derive from another unavoidable risk of the new shadow war: the need to depend on local proxies who may be unreliable or corrupt, or whose agendas differ from that of the United States.
American officials have a troubled history with Mr. Saleh, a wily political survivor who cultivates radical clerics at election time and has a history of making deals with jihadists. Until recently, taking on Al Qaeda had not been a priority for his government, which has been fighting an intermittent armed rebellion since 2004.
And for all Mr. Saleh's power -- his portraits hang everywhere in the Yemeni capital -- his government is deeply unpopular in the remote provinces where the militants have sought sanctuary. The tribes there tend to regularly switch sides, making it difficult to depend on them for information about Al Qaeda. ''My state is anyone who fills my pocket with money,'' goes one old tribal motto.
The Yemeni security services are similarly unreliable and have collaborated with jihadists at times. The United States has trained elite counterterrorism teams there in recent years, but the military still suffers from corruption and poor discipline.
It is still not clear why Mr. Shabwani, the Marib deputy governor, was killed. The day he died, he was planning to meet members of Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch in Wadi Abeeda, a remote, lawless plain dotted with orange groves east of Yemen's capital. The most widely accepted explanation is that Yemeni and American officials failed to fully communicate before the attack.
Abdul Ghani al-Eryani, a Yemeni political analyst, said the civilian deaths in the first strike and the killing of the deputy governor in May ''had a devastating impact.'' The mishaps, he said, ''embarrassed the government and gave ammunition to Al Qaeda and the Salafists,'' he said, referring to adherents of the form of Islam embraced by militants.
American officials said President Saleh was angry about the strike in May, but not so angry as to call for a halt to the clandestine American operations. ''At the end of the day, it's not like he said, 'No more,' '' said one Obama administration official. ''He didn't kick us out of the country.''
Weighing Success
Despite the airstrike campaign, the leadership of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula survives, and there is little sign the group is much weaker.
Attacks by Qaeda militants in Yemen have picked up again, with several deadly assaults on Yemeni army convoys in recent weeks. Al Qaeda's Yemen branch has managed to put out its first English-language online magazine, Inspire, complete with bomb-making instructions. Intelligence officials believe that Samir Khan, a 24-year-old American who arrived from North Carolina last year, played a major role in producing the slick publication.
As a test case, the strikes have raised the classic trade-off of the post-Sept. 11 era: Do the selective hits make the United States safer by eliminating terrorists? Or do they help the terrorist network frame its violence as a heroic religious struggle against American aggression, recruiting new operatives for the enemy?
Al Qaeda has worked tirelessly to exploit the strikes, and in Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric now hiding in Yemen, the group has perhaps the most sophisticated ideological opponent the United States has faced since 2001.
''If George W. Bush is remembered by getting America stuck in Afghanistan and Iraq, it's looking like Obama wants to be remembered as the president who got America stuck in Yemen,'' the cleric said in a March Internet address that was almost gleeful about the American campaign.
Most Yemenis have little sympathy for Al Qaeda and have observed the American strikes with ''passive indignation,'' Mr. Eryani said. But, he added, ''I think the strikes over all have been counterproductive.''
Edmund J. Hull, the United States ambassador to Yemen from 2001 to 2004, cautioned that American policy must not be limited to using force against Al Qaeda.
''I think it's both understandable and defensible for the Obama administration to pursue aggressive counterterrorism operations,'' Mr. Hull said. But he added: ''I'm concerned that counterterrorism is defined as an intelligence and military program. To be successful in the long run, we have to take a far broader approach that emphasizes political, social and economic forces.''
Obama administration officials say that is exactly what they are doing -- sharply increasing the foreign aid budget for Yemen and offering both money and advice to address the country's crippling problems. They emphasized that the core of the American effort was not the strikes but training for elite Yemeni units, providing equipment and sharing intelligence to support Yemeni sweeps against Al Qaeda.
Still, the historical track record of limited military efforts like the Yemen strikes is not encouraging. Micah Zenko, a fellow at the Center for Preventive Action at the Council on Foreign Relations, examines in a forthcoming book what he has labeled ''discrete military operations'' from the Balkans to Pakistan since the end of the cold war in 1991. He found that these operations seldom achieve either their military or political objectives.
But he said that over the years, military force had proved to be a seductive tool that tended to dominate ''all the discussions and planning'' and push more subtle solutions to the side.
When terrorists threaten Americans, Mr. Zenko said, ''there is tremendous pressure from the National Security Council and the Congressional committees to, quote, 'do something.' ''
That is apparent to visitors at the American Embassy in Sana, who have noticed that it is increasingly crowded with military personnel and intelligence operatives. For now, the shadow warriors are taking the lead.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 22, 2010; August 29, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the Obama administration's shadow war against Al Qaeda and its allies in roughly a dozen countries gave an outdated affiliation in some editions for Micah Zenko, who in a forthcoming book looks at what he calls ''discrete military operations'' from the Balkans to Pakistan since the end of the cold war. Mr. Zenko is a fellow at the Center for Preventive Action at the Council on Foreign Relations; he is no longer a scholar at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Aug. 15 about the Obama administration's secret counterterrorism operations overseas described incorrectly a recent strike in northern Africa that was cited as an example of coordination with allies. The strike in question, on July 22, was carried out by French and Mauritanian troops near the border between Mauritania and Mali; it was not a French strike in Algeria.

 Attacking Al Qaeda in Yemen: For months, the United States has waged a military campaign against Al Qaeda in Yemen, as operatives have created strongholds there. Obama administration officials say that the strikes have killed dozens of militants, although they add that none of the group's leaders have been killed. Critics say the strikes have sometimes been counterproductive, missing targets and killing civilians, which has generated resentment among local people. (A11)

HEADLINE: Return of the Killer Trade Deficit

 BODY:
The world economy is falling back on very dangerous habits. The United States is tentatively emerging from recession but is still at risk of another dip. Yet trade statistics released last week indicate that American consumers are sucking in large quantities of imports as spending recovers, while weak demand in the rest of the world is crimping American exports. 
Meanwhile, China is mopping up demand everywhere you look with its artificially cheap supply of goods. Germany, the world's other exporting power, is cutting its budget and relying on foreign demand to drive its economic rebound. This isn't sustainable.
The bulging American trade deficit means that rising consumer demand is flowing to suppliers overseas rather than fueling growth at home. The American economy is too weak to carry this load. The recent trade data led economists to slash growth estimates for this year.
For the global recovery to continue, domestic demand must revive around the world. Other leading countries must do more to stimulate their own demand. And China cannot keep hogging the global export market.
The numbers are staggering. The United States trade deficit ballooned to $49.9 billion in June, the biggest since October 2008. In July, one month later, China recorded a $28.7 billion trade surplus, the biggest since January 2009. In the first five months of the year, Germany's trade surplus, driven in large part by demand for machine tools in recovering Asian economies, rose 30 percent compared with 2009, to about $75 billion.
Unsurprisingly, data from both sides of the oceans mesh: the United States' bilateral deficit with China rose 17 percent in June, to $26.2 billion -- the biggest in 40 months. It rose 5 percent with Germany, to $3 billion.
The pattern underscores big problems with the mix of economic policies around the world. As Germany and other rich countries in Europe start slashing their budgets and the world economy slows, the United States -- beleaguered as it is -- has been left as a lone source of demand growth. Meanwhile, Beijing's reluctance to end an economic strategy based on cheap exports is cementing its position as the world's demand hog.
There are bad ways to address this problem. Punish China rumblings are back on Capitol Hill, but any move to slap punitive tariffs on Chinese goods could lead to destructive tit-for-tat retaliation. The drive by Congressional Republicans to end the Obama administration's sensible (and still too weak) stimulus policies might help cut the trade deficit -- but only by tipping the economy back into recession.
There is a proper approach to this rising threat. Chinese leaders have to finally rebalance their economy and rely more on internal demand and less on exports. The central bank announced in June that it would allow China's currency to start inching up against the dollar -- but it has risen less than half a percent. China must deliver. Rich economies with big trade surpluses and the ability to sustain budget deficits -- most notably Germany -- need to spend more, not less, at home and abroad.
After the risk of recession has receded, the United States must work to correct its longstanding trade deficit with the world by slowing national spending and increasing savings. But there will be no recovery -- here or around the world -- unless all of the major economic players do more to bolster demand right now.

HEADLINE: Variable Pricing And Net Neutrality

BYLINE: By ROB COX and ROBERT CYRAN

 BODY:
It is easy to frame the debate over net neutrality as an ideological battle between forces who want unfettered Internet access and those who would prevent it. In reality, as with most good fights, it is largely a dispute over money. Some pretty basic numbers illustrate the point -- and provide an idea of where the debate should logically wind up.
There are two broad constituencies at odds in this quarrel. On one side are providers of Web access. Call them the Pipes. They include the telecommunications giants AT&T and Verizon, who have a combined 142 million wireless customers and provide fiber and DSL connections to homes. Alongside are the cable operators, led by Comcast and Time Warner Cable, who together reach into 30 million American homes. 
In the other side are those companies that benefit the most from surging traffic on the Internet. Call them the Swipes. Included in this camp are Apple, Google, Cisco and Microsoft. Their businesses -- whether selling search advertising, routers for data or snazzy mobile devices -- demand ever-larger amounts of bandwidth to grow.
But the economics are incredibly skewed. The Pipes bear the price of building the infrastructure on which all these Web businesses depend. That is reflected starkly on their balance sheets. The four biggest Pipes have combined net debt of around $143 billion. Last year alone they spent $42 billion on capital expenses.
As for the four leading Swipes, they have a combined net cash pile of around $140 billion. Last year they spent $4.9 billion on capital expansion, a tenth of what the big four Pipes paid to erect new cell towers, buy routers and extend fiber-optic cables.
The switch to mobile devices like the iPad and Android-powered handsets will aggravate this divide. Cell networks were intended for short and infrequent calls. Customers use these new gadgets longer, more frequently and download more data. If people use wireless connections in the same way they use their broadband connections, operators would need 10 times as many base stations, according to research from Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
The introduction of variable pricing, or charging customers based on the data they consume, will help pay for the needed gear. But it means that the already unpopular Pipes will stick their customers with far larger bills -- a recipe for political interference. Meantime, the Swipes would continue to carry away what the telecom operators see as a disproportionate share of the benefits.
Some of the Swipes realize this imbalance is not sustainable. Witness Google's decision last week to issue a shared statement of principles with Verizon to protect ''the future openness of the Internet and encouraging the rapid deployment of broadband.''
Of course, there is no assurance that those principles will be accepted by regulators, Congress, other companies or consumer groups. But the proposal shows how much of the Pipes-and-Swipes dispute centers on economics.
Wired networks are largely built out, and need relatively modest new capital. So the proposal gives the Swipes what they want for existing Internet services -- carriers can't favor, or charge premiums, for transmitting one sort of data traffic over another.
Wireless networks, on the other hand, need huge investment and face capacity constraints. The Pipes get something they like here. Traffic on these networks would remain largely unregulated, and carriers could charge more for carrying services like streaming video.
Google, once the leading proponent of strict net neutrality, may have recognized the symbiotic relationship that exists between its business and that of the Pipes. Not all its peers will follow suit. Facebook is already challenging the Google-Verizon detente. But over time it is hard to see this as anything more than a negotiating stance.
Already it is clear that demand for bandwidth is outpacing supply. If this persists, it will act as a drag on growth for the Swipes. They could take matters into their own hands by, for example, buying one of the Pipes or sharing more of their revenue with them.
The better financial option, though, is to expand the size of the profit pie. And that is why the Swipes and the Pipes will increasingly find a middle ground like the one staked out by Google and Verizon. Call it a net neutral zone.

HEADLINE: Interest Rates, Stuck to Floor

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
As 2010 began, there was nearly unanimous agreement in financial circles on at least one thing: Interest rates were sure to rise during the year.
Quite to the contrary. As Labor Day approaches, interest rates have collapsed, plunging along with economic optimism.
That turn of events, which has shocked savers and stunned investors, appears to indicate that financial markets' worries are turning in a very different direction from those of many governments.
The governments are seeking ways to bring down budget deficits, fearing that without austerity they could go so far into debt that they would never be able to borrow again. Investors in the financial markets seem to be much more concerned by the possibility of renewed recession and a general deflation that could send asset values and prices down.
That market reaction is the opposite of what happened in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Then ''bond vigilantes'' were reluctant to invest in United States Treasury securities because they feared runaway inflation. Their refusal drove up the interest rates the government had to pay on its borrowings and eventually led the Federal Reserve, under Paul A. Volcker, to wage war against inflation even if it meant choking off economic growth. 
Now, far from showing a reluctance to finance the American government, investors are seeking safety and evidently believe American government debt is the safest possible investment. They have rushed to send money to the Treasury, thereby reducing borrowing costs for the government.
By late 2009, interest rates had fallen to levels previously thought inconceivable. The annual yield on a two-year Treasury note dipped below 1 percent. But it has since traded barely above one-half percent.
Perhaps investors are nervous because they fear governments will swing too far toward austerity. When economies weakened three years ago, talk immediately turned to economic stimulus. This time, much of the discussion in Washington, as well as in many European capitals, has focused on the need to reduce spending and deficits, rather than on the possibility that additional stimulus might be needed to avert a new worldwide downturn.
The new British government has announced plans for sharp spending reductions aimed at narrowing deficits and government borrowing, even as the Bank of England has said the growth outlook is dimming.
Deficit hawks are leaning forward in the United States as well. ''Many Americans and most senators feel that the level of the federal debt is at crisis levels,'' Senator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, said in a Senate debate last month, adding that the debt ''threatens the security of our country.''
Much of the new international worry about government spending was prompted by the Greek debt crisis this year. It avoided default only with help from other European countries. That aid was conditioned on Greece agreeing to a strong austerity program, to be monitored by a group including representatives of the International Monetary Fund.
The I.M.F. has often prescribed austerity for countries in trouble, but last week two senior officials of the fund sought to slow the push for spending reductions in major economies. They challenged the perception that national budgets are in trouble because of the bailouts and fiscal stimulus programs that were enacted to combat the financial crisis.
''Today's debt problems,'' wrote Olivier J. Blanchard, the chief economist, and Carlo Cottarelli, the fund's head of fiscal affairs, in an essay published in The Financial Times, ''result not from how fiscal policy was managed during the crisis, but from how it was mismanaged before the crisis.''
Countries, they said, should have built up savings when times were good. The two officials argued for restraint in imposing austerity programs now, advocating the adoption of fiscal reforms that will have their largest impact in later years.
The problems that confronted Greece could not precisely replicate themselves in either the United States or Britain. Both borrow in their own currencies, which they could print if others were reluctant to make loans.
It would be disastrous if either country got to the point that investors abandoned it, or even drove up interest rates sharply by scaling back their support. But precisely the opposite has happened this year.
That interest rates have declined is good news in many respects. ''There are,'' said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, ''always people who have jobs who can take full advantage of lower interest rates to borrow and spend.''
But that impact now may be weakened by two factors, perhaps increasing the need for fiscal stimulus.
First, there are many who will not be helped. Homeowners with ample equity and income can refinance their mortgages at record low rates, which fell to 4.4 percent last week. But millions of homeowners either lack sufficient income or have houses no longer worth what is owed on the mortgage. They cannot refinance.
And while government borrowing costs have plunged in the countries deemed safest by investors, they have risen in some others. Germany now pays 1.4 percent on five-year borrowings, while Greece pays more than 11 percent. The German economy is booming, while the Greek recession is worsening.
The second negative factor from lower interest rates now is harder to quantify, but may be of growing importance. Those people who depend on their savings to provide income now earn far less from their thrift than they used to receive. Some avoided sharp declines by purchasing longer-term certificates of deposit from banks. But as those C.D.'s mature, the banks are offering low rates even on long-term deposits.
The growing disenchantment with government spending has led to talk of the world reaching a ''Keynesian endpoint,'' as Anthony J. Crescenzi, a strategist for Pimco, a large investment firm, put it this summer. At such a time, countries needing to rescue banks and stimulate their economies would be unable or unwilling to do so.
The Federal Reserve's move last week, in which it committed to buying up a small amount of Treasury securities, showed its determination to act but ''may have exacerbated the fears,'' said Dean Maki, the chief United States economist for Barclays Capital. ''The Fed seemed to have significantly downgraded its economic outlook,'' but its policy change ''appeared fairly minor in comparison.''
Lower interest rates are already helping some companies. I.B.M. is paying only 1 percent to borrow $1.5 billion for three years. And as some investors search for better yields, many companies are benefiting. Last week, a record $14.3 billion of new bonds were issued around the world by companies with bond ratings lower than investment grade, Thomson Reuters reported.
At the same time, new stock issues have declined. Still, stock prices are slightly below where they were at the end of 2009, when many analysts expected a better recovery than seems to be unfolding. The new concerns have manifested themselves more in bond prices than in stock levels.
Economics is a notoriously uncertain discipline. It is possible that a surprisingly strong employment report, or some other unanticipated event, could begin to disperse the fog of economic pessimism that has engulfed investors and sent interest rates to record lows.
But for now, the financial markets seem to fear recession and deflation much more than they fear deficit spending.

HEADLINE: Attacking Social Security

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Social Security turned 75 last week. It should have been a joyous occasion, a time to celebrate a program that has brought dignity and decency to the lives of older Americans.
But the program is under attack, with some Democrats as well as nearly all Republicans joining the assault. Rumor has it that President Obama's deficit commission may call for deep benefit cuts, in particular a sharp rise in the retirement age.
Social Security's attackers claim that they're concerned about the program's financial future. But their math doesn't add up, and their hostility isn't really about dollars and cents. Instead, it's about ideology and posturing. And underneath it all is ignorance of or indifference to the realities of life for many Americans. 
About that math: Legally, Social Security has its own, dedicated funding, via the payroll tax (''FICA'' on your pay statement). But it's also part of the broader federal budget. This dual accounting means that there are two ways Social Security could face financial problems. First, that dedicated funding could prove inadequate, forcing the program either to cut benefits or to turn to Congress for aid. Second, Social Security costs could prove unsupportable for the federal budget as a whole.
But neither of these potential problems is a clear and present danger. Social Security has been running surpluses for the last quarter-century, banking those surpluses in a special account, the so-called trust fund. The program won't have to turn to Congress for help or cut benefits until or unless the trust fund is exhausted, which the program's actuaries don't expect to happen until 2037 -- and there's a significant chance, according to their estimates, that that day will never come.
Meanwhile, an aging population will eventually (over the course of the next 20 years) cause the cost of paying Social Security benefits to rise from its current 4.8 percent of G.D.P. to about 6 percent of G.D.P. To give you some perspective, that's a significantly smaller increase than the rise in defense spending since 2001, which Washington certainly didn't consider a crisis, or even a reason to rethink some of the Bush tax cuts.
So where do claims of crisis come from? To a large extent they rely on bad-faith accounting. In particular, they rely on an exercise in three-card monte in which the surpluses Social Security has been running for a quarter-century don't count -- because hey, the program doesn't have any independent existence; it's just part of the general federal budget -- while future Social Security deficits are unacceptable -- because hey, the program has to stand on its own.
It would be easy to dismiss this bait-and-switch as obvious nonsense, except for one thing: many influential people -- including Alan Simpson, co-chairman of the president's deficit commission -- are peddling this nonsense.
And having invented a crisis, what do Social Security's attackers want to do? They don't propose cutting benefits to current retirees; invariably the plan is, instead, to cut benefits many years in the future. So think about it this way: In order to avoid the possibility of future benefit cuts, we must cut future benefits. O.K.
What's really going on here? Conservatives hate Social Security for ideological reasons: its success undermines their claim that government is always the problem, never the solution. But they receive crucial support from Washington insiders, for whom a declared willingness to cut Social Security has long served as a badge of fiscal seriousness, never mind the arithmetic.
And neither wing of the anti-Social-Security coalition seems to know or care about the hardship its favorite proposals would cause.
The currently fashionable idea of raising the retirement age even more than it will rise under existing law -- it has already gone from 65 to 66, it's scheduled to rise to 67, but now some are proposing that it go to 70 -- is usually justified with assertions that life expectancy has risen, so people can easily work later into life. But that's only true for affluent, white-collar workers -- the people who need Social Security least.
I'm not just talking about the fact that it's a lot easier to imagine working until you're 70 if you have a comfortable office job than if you're engaged in manual labor. America is becoming an increasingly unequal society -- and the growing disparities extend to matters of life and death. Life expectancy at age 65 has risen a lot at the top of the income distribution, but much less for lower-income workers. And remember, the retirement age is already scheduled to rise under current law.
So let's beat back this unnecessary, unfair and -- let's not mince words -- cruel attack on working Americans. Big cuts in Social Security should not be on the table.

HEADLINE: China Overtakes Japan to Become No. 2 Global Economic Power

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Hiroko Tabuchi contributed from Tokyo.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- After three decades of spectacular growth, China passed Japan in the second quarter to become the world's second-largest economy behind the United States, according to government figures released early Monday.
The milestone, though anticipated for some time, is the most striking evidence yet that China's ascendance is for real and that the rest of the world will have to reckon with a new economic superpower.
The recognition came early Monday, when Tokyo said that Japan's economy was valued at about $1.28 trillion in the second quarter, slightly below China's $1.33 trillion. Japan's economy grew 0.4 percent in the quarter, Tokyo said, substantially less than forecast. That weakness suggests that China's economy will race past Japan's for the full year.
Experts say unseating Japan -- and in recent years passing Germany, France and Great Britain -- underscores China's growing clout and bolsters forecasts that China will pass the United States as the world's biggest economy as early as 2030. America's gross domestic product was about $14 trillion in 2009. 
''This has enormous significance,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''It reconfirms what's been happening for the better part of a decade: China has been eclipsing Japan economically. For everyone in China's region, they're now the biggest trading partner rather than the U.S. or Japan.''
For Japan, whose economy has been stagnating for more than a decade, the figures reflect a decline in economic and political power. Japan has had the world's second-largest economy for much of the last four decades, according to the World Bank. And during the 1980s, there was even talk about Japan's economy some day overtaking that of the United States.
But while Japan's economy is mature and its population quickly aging, China is in the throes of urbanization and is far from developed, analysts say, meaning it has a much lower standard of living, as well as a lot more room to grow. Just five years ago, China's gross domestic product was about $2.3 trillion, about half of Japan's.
This country has roughly the same land mass as the United States, but it is burdened with a fifth of the world's population and insufficient resources.
Its per capita income is more on a par with those of impoverished nations like Algeria, El Salvador and Albania -- which, along with China, are close to $3,600 -- than that of the United States, where it is about $46,000.
Yet there is little disputing that under the direction of the Communist Party, China has begun to reshape the way the global economy functions by virtue of its growing dominance of trade, its huge hoard of foreign exchange reserves and United States government debt and its voracious appetite for oil, coal, iron ore and other natural resources.
China is already a major driver of global growth. The country's leaders have grown more confident on the international stage and have begun to assert greater influence in Asia, Africa and Latin America, with things like special trade agreements and multibillion dollar resource deals.
''They're exerting a lot of influence on the global economy and becoming dominant in Asia,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell and former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. ''A lot of other economies in the region are essentially riding on China's coat tails, and this is remarkable for an economy with a low per capita income.''
In Japan, the mood was one of resignation. Though increasingly eclipsed by Beijing on the world stage, Japan has benefited from a booming China, initially by businesses moving production there to take advantage of lower wages and, as local incomes have risen, by tapping a large and increasingly lucrative market for Japanese goods.
Beijing is also beginning to shape global dialogues on a range of issues, analysts said; for instance, last year it asserted that the dollar must be phased out as the world's primary reserve currency.
And while the United States and the European Union are struggling to grow in the wake of the worst economic crisis in decades, China has continued to climb up the economic league tables by investing heavily in infrastructure and backing a $586 billion stimulus plan.
This year, although growth has begun to moderate a bit, China's economy is forecast to expand about 10 percent -- continuing a remarkable three-decade streak of double-digit growth.
''This is just the beginning,'' said Wang Tao, an economist at UBS in Beijing. ''China is still a developing country. So it has a lot of room to grow. And China has the biggest impact on commodity prices -- in Russia, India, Australia and Latin America.''
There are huge challenges ahead, though. Economists say that China's economy is too heavily dependent on exports and investment and that it needs to encourage greater domestic consumption -- something China has struggled to do.
The country's largely state-run banks have recently been criticized for lending far too aggressively in the last year while shifting some loans off their balance sheet to disguise lending and evade rules meant to curtail lending growth.
China is also locked in a fierce debate over its currency policy, with the United States, European Union and others accusing Beijing of keeping the Chinese currency, the renminbi, artificially low to bolster exports -- leading to huge trade surpluses for China but major bilateral trade deficits for the United States and the European Union. China says that its currency is not substantially undervalued and that it is moving ahead with currency reform.
Regardless, China's rapid growth suggests that it will continue to compete fiercely with the United States and Europe for natural resources but also offer big opportunities for companies eager to tap its market.
Although its economy is still only one-third the size of the American economy, China passed the United States last year to become the world's largest market for passenger vehicles. China also passed Germany last year to become the world's biggest exporter.
Global companies like Caterpillar, General Electric, General Motors and Siemens -- as well as scores of others -- are making a more aggressive push into China, in some cases moving research and development centers here.
Some analysts, though, say that while China is eager to assert itself as a financial and economic power -- and to push its state companies to ''go global'' -- it is reluctant to play a greater role in the debate over climate change or how to slow the growth of greenhouse gases.
China passed the United States in 2006 to become the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, which scientists link to global warming. But China also has an ambitious program to cut the energy it uses for each unit of economic output by 20 percent by the end of 2010, compared to 2006.
Assessing what China's newfound clout means, though, is complicated. While the country is still relatively poor per capita, it has an authoritarian government that is capable of taking decisive action -- to stimulate the economy, build new projects and invest in specific industries.
That, Mr. Lardy at the Peterson Institute said, gives the country unusual power. ''China is already the primary determiner of the price of virtually every major commodity,'' he said. ''And the Chinese government can be much more decisive in allocating resources in a way that other governments of this level of per capita income cannot.''

HEADLINE: A Big Splash for a Prohibition Drama

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
WHAT does a cable channel do after losing a virtual monopoly on critically lauded, highly rated programming? How about taking a walk on Boardwalk?
The channel is HBO, which is battling to regain the acclaim it enjoyed not long ago when its prime-time schedule featured shows like ''Sex and the City,'' ''Six Feet Under,'' ''The Sopranos'' and ''The Wire.'' Although some current HBO series like ''True Blood'' are generating buzz, channels like AMC, FX, Showtime, Starz and USA are making millions of viewers forget the slogan ''It's not TV. It's HBO.''
To help turn the tide, HBO is betting on ''Boardwalk Empire,'' a 12-episode drama series that is to begin on Sept. 19. The show, based on actual events, takes place in the 1920s and uses Atlantic City as a microcosm of how profoundly the United States was changed by Prohibition. ''When alcohol was outlawed,'' the tune-in ads proclaim, ''outlaws became kings.'' 
A multimedia campaign to promote ''Boardwalk Empire'' is scheduled to begin on Monday. HBO plans to spend ''a little north of $10 million'' on the campaign, said Chris Spadaccini, vice president for advertising and promotions for HBO in New York.
That is more than half what it cost to make the first episode, which was directed by Martin Scorsese; he is also a producer of the series.
''We want the campaign to feel big to reflect the scope and scale of the production,'' Mr. Spadaccini said. ''We want to position 'Boardwalk Empire' as an epic crime drama and make people feel it's a must-see television event.''
The campaign reflects how ad spending by entertainment companies has become a mainstay -- perhaps a godsend -- for the media during the uncertain economy. Campaigns for TV shows, movies, DVDs, Blu-ray discs, video games and books are proliferating amid cutbacks by marketers in categories like luxury goods, retailing and travel.
A centerpiece of the ''Boardwalk Empire'' campaign will be partnerships between HBO and three marketers, coordinated by the Civic Entertainment Group in New York. They are the Bloomingdale's unit of Macy's Inc.; Caesars Atlantic City and its parent, Harrah's Entertainment; and Canadian Club whisky, sold by the Beam Global Spirits and Wine division of Fortune Brands.
''There were three themes we focused on'' in finding the partners, said Sarah Goodnow, account director at Civic Entertainment, listing them as ''1920s fashion; Atlantic City itself; and Prohibition and the era of speakeasies, rum-running and bootlegging.''
All three marketers will amplify the ads from HBO with their own promotions. They include a boardwalk, 115 feet long and 6 feet wide, to be put on the Third Avenue side of the flagship Bloomingdale's store in Manhattan; 1,920 rooms at Caesars Atlantic City, set aside from Sept. 16 to 30, priced at $19.20 a night; and Canadian Club events at bars styled like speakeasies in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia.
One of the three partners, Canadian Club, figures in the plot of ''Boardwalk Empire.'' The creators of the series sought to reflect period events by showing rival gangsters fighting over shipments of wooden cases of the whisky.
Although no one at Canadian Club talked about Prohibition for decades, ''you can't deny that this brand was at the heart and soul of this era,'' said Kevin George, senior vice president and global chief marketing officer at Beam in Deerfield, Ill., ''and that is interesting to consumers.''
The battling bootleggers in ''Boardwalk Empire'' represent only one of many violent, gory moments. For instance, the first episode includes murders, shootings, corpses and the beating of a pregnant woman. Oh, and nudity and obscenity.
Scores of advertisers have policies to avoid sponsoring or being associated with TV programs containing such subject matter. But it did not deter the signing of marketing partners for ''Boardwalk Empire,'' Mr. Spadaccini said, because ''with HBO, they know what they're getting into: a premium network with adult content.''
''The violence is not gratuitous; it's part of the narrative,'' he added. ''And it is Scorsese.''
That was echoed by Erin Chamberlin, vice president for marketing at the Caesars Atlantic City and Bally's Atlantic City hotels and casinos.
''It's done for cinematic purposes, not for thrill purposes,'' Ms. Chamberlin said of the contents of the series. Besides, ''we cater to a 21-and-above crowd,'' she added. ''It's not like we are Disney.''
Caesars Atlantic City will host a premiere for ''Boardwalk Empire'' on Sept. 16, Ms. Chamberlin said, and plans a viewing party three nights later when the debut episode appears on HBO.
There will also be collaboration among the marketing partners. For example, Canadian Club is to be the exclusive distilled spirits sponsor for the premiere, along with other promotional events.
And a sweepstakes at boardwalkempireac.com will offer prizes like access to a suite with a ''stocked bar'' at Caesars Atlantic City for three days a month for a year and shopping sprees at Bloomingdale's.
The tune-in campaign from HBO -- created internally and by BLT & Associates in Hollywood, Calif. -- includes television, print, outdoor and online ads, as well as bus shelters in Chicago and New York that will be decorated with models of liquor barrels, bottles and cases.
Hmm. Is that because the vagaries of mass transit can drive riders to drink?

HEADLINE: Bobbing and Weaving To Avoid Taking the Hits

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Stimulus spending, government bailouts and a complex health care law can be heavy bricks in the backpacks of Democratic Congressional candidates.
The Connecticut Senate hopeful Richard Blumenthal's strategy: They're not mine. Though Democratic solidarity has allowed President Obama to win key votes, Mr. Blumenthal, the state attorney general, offers a campaign-season dissent.
He said he opposed federal bailouts as ''too big'' and ''too risky,'' and the stimulus ''because it was inadequately structured'' to aid the economy. On health care, he slammed Mr. Obama as accepting ''a sweetheart deal'' with drug companies at the expense of consumers. 
If life is like high school, elections sometimes resemble a big game of dodge ball. And a multistate tour of competitive races last week showed how 2010 candidates in both parties are bobbing and weaving to avoid getting hit.
It's tougher for Democrats - especially those who, unlike Mr. Blumenthal, have had to cast votes on Mr. Obama's agenda. Representative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania, now seeking a Senate seat, employs a biographical defense maneuver that makes his Navy career a shield against charges of ideological overreach.
''I was on the ground in Afghanistan shortly after the war began,'' he said. In the military, ''we don't breed liberals and we don't breed conservatives. We breed practical problem solvers, and that's how I've approached it.''
Hazards on the Way
With Democrats controlling the White House and Congress alike, Republican candidates can spend nearly all their time on the attack. But there remain notable hazards to be avoided.
Take the Roadmap for America's Future offered by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the ranking Budget Committee Republican, who calls for major, politically risky changes in Social Security and Medicare. Ask Republicans in competitive races about it, and watch them duck.
''I haven't read Paul's road map,'' said former Representative Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Mr. Sestak's Republican opponent.
''I support some of what Paul Ryan has suggested, not all of it,'' said Linda E. McMahon, Mr. Blumenthal's Republican foe for the Connecticut Senate seat. ''One of the things we have to do is protect our senior citizens.''
State Senator Robert Hurt of Virginia, the Republican challenger to Representative Tom Perriello, a Democrat, in Virginia's Fifth House District, agreed. ''I do not support it as it's introduced,'' Mr. Hurt said. ''I would not support cutting benefits for Social Security.''
Like many Republicans, Mr. Hurt is grappling with the double-edged sword that the Tea Party movement has become. Tea Party adherents unsuccessfully backed Mr. Hurt's Republican primary rivals, and a Tea Party member is now running as an independent.
Mr. Hurt skipped a debate last week involving that independent candidate, Jeffrey Clark, to avoid elevating the profile of a competitor vying for support on the right. But in a district that blends rural conservatives with liberals in the university town of Charlottesville, Mr. Hurt is loath to claim the provocative Tea Party label for himself.
''I'd probably call myself a state senator from Virginia,'' he said.
Tax? What Tax?
As chief executives, governors have more trouble dodging responsibility for tough decisions. And since most states can't run deficits, as Washington does, governors in both parties often raise taxes.
In a year like this, however, no one is eager to admit it. So former Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. of Maryland, a Republican trying to win back his old job, insisted the Bay Restoration Fee charged to municipal water customers during his tenure was not a tax.
''That's a dedicated fee for a specific purpose,'' Mr. Erhlich said. ''If you throw the dollars into the general fund, then you can call it a tax.''
Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat who beat Mr. Erhlich four years ago, dismissed that argument. He referred to the fee by its colloquial name, the ''flush tax.''
Yet Mr. O'Malley has a bigger problem: running as an incumbent when voters are unhappy about hard economic times. His defense: ''People know that no governor can steer around a global recession.''
While absolving himself of responsibility for high unemployment, however, Mr. O'Malley noted that Maryland was now adding new jobs faster than neighboring Virginia, whose governor, Robert F. McDonnell, is a Republican.
At the same time, a few candidates are notable for their refusal to dodge. In Virginia, Representative Perriello was vulnerable from the start after upsetting former Representative Virgil Goode, a Republican, by fewer than 1,000 votes in 2008.
Mr. Perriello has backed most of Mr. Obama's agenda nonetheless, and Republican strategists count him among their easiest targets. Yet he remains alongside Mr. Obama on a cap-and-trade energy bill to limit carbon dioxide emissions, and in calling for higher taxes on the wealthy.
''If you can stay in Washington just by staying away from the big problems,'' Mr. Perriello said, ''then what's the point of being there in the first place?''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Triumph Fades On Racial Gap In City Schools

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN and ROBERT GEBELOFF; Jennifer Medina contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Two years ago, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, testified before Congress about the city's impressive progress in closing the gulf in performance between minority and white children. The gains were historic, all but unheard of in recent decades.
''Over the past six years, we've done everything possible to narrow the achievement gap -- and we have,'' Mr. Bloomberg testified. ''In some cases, we've reduced it by half.''
''We are closing the shameful achievement gap faster than ever,'' the mayor said again in 2009, as city reading scores -- now acknowledged as the height of a test score bubble -- showed nearly 70 percent of children had met state standards.
When results from the 2010 tests, which state officials said presented a more accurate portrayal of students' abilities, were released last month, they came as a blow to the legacy of the mayor and the chancellor, as passing rates dropped by more than 25 percentage points on most tests. But the most painful part might well have been the evaporation of one of their signature accomplishments: the closing of the racial achievement gap. 
Among the students in the city's third through eighth grades, 40 percent of black students and 46 percent of Hispanic students met state standards in math, compared with 75 percent of white students and 82 percent of Asian students. In English, 33 percent of black students and 34 percent of Hispanic students are now proficient, compared with 64 percent among whites and Asians.
''The claims were based on some bad information,'' said Michael J. Petrilli, a vice president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a research group that studies education policy. ''On achievement, the story in New York City is of some modest progress, but not the miracle that the mayor and the chancellor would like to claim.''
Reducing racial gaps in educational performance has been a national preoccupation for decades. But after substantial progress in the 1970s and '80s, the effort has largely stalled, except for a brief period from 1999 to 2004, where there were some gains, particularly in reading, according to a report released this month by the Educational Testing Service, which develops standardized tests used across the country.
The achievement gap was also the main thrust of the No Child Left Behind law, which mandated annual testing for all students in grades three through eight and required school systems to track the performance of each racial and ethnic group, with the goal of bringing all children to proficiency by 2014.
New York City's progress in closing its achievement gap on those tests drew national attention as a possible model for other urban school districts. It won praise from President George W. Bush as evidence that No Child Left Behind was working. In 2007, the city won a prestigious urban education prize from the Broad Foundation, which cited the city's progress in narrowing the racial achievement gap.
But the latest state math and English tests show that the proficiency gap between minority and white students has returned to about the same level as when the mayor arrived. In 2002, 31 percent of black students were considered proficient in math, for example, while 65 percent of white students met that standard.
Experts have many theories, but no clear answers, about why national progress on closing the gap has slowed. They included worsening economic conditions for poor families and an increase in fatherless black households, social factors that interfere with students' educational progress.
Mr. Klein said in an interview that he was not discouraged by New York City's performance on the 2010 state tests, and that he still felt ''awfully good'' about improvements for black and Hispanic students, noting their rising graduation rates and college enrollments.
''I don't think we claimed it was a miracle; certainly I don't believe it was a miracle,'' he said. ''I think there are sustained steady gains here, and I think that's important.''
Unbowed, Mr. Klein said the new test results reinforced some of his beliefs and policies: he said he would continue to close low-performing schools, for example, and would keep pushing to pay more to teachers who work in hard-to-staff neighborhoods or subjects, which the teachers' union has resisted.
The bulk of Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Klein's effort to overhaul the education system has been focused on the lowest-performing students. The city has closed 91 poorly performing schools, established about 100 charter schools and sent waves of new young teachers and principals into schools in poor neighborhoods.
Mr. Klein began to use test scores to measure schools' performance, and joined with the Rev. Al Sharpton in forming the Education Equality Project in 2008 to promote good instruction and education reform for minority and poor children. ''It is certainly what makes Joel Klein tick,'' said Kati Haycock, the president of the Education Trust, which advocates for progress on the issue. ''And you can't say that for everyone.''
The city has even tried to attack the deeper issue of how children are reared at home, by offering some families monetary incentives to go to the dentist for checkups, for example, or to maintain good school attendance. The three-year-old pilot project was ended in March after it showed only modest results.
For several years, data suggested that the city had seen improvements among all ethnic groups, including in graduation rates, which have risen about 14 percentage points for black and Hispanic students since 2005, and a national standardized test given every other year to a sampling of fourth and eighth graders.
Even so, the scores on the national test, considered tougher than the state tests, did not exactly show a mastery of material. Forty-nine percent of white students and 17 percent of black students showed proficiency on the fourth-grade English test in 2009, for example, up from 45 percent of white students and 13 percent of black students in 2003.
The city made no statistically significant progress in closing the racial achievement gap in that time, said Arnold Goldstein, a statistician at the National Center for Education Statistics, which administers the national test. With few exceptions, including Charlotte, N.C., and Washington, D.C., the achievement gap on the national tests has remained constant in all major cities.
But the test scores that the mayor and the chancellor chose to highlight were the state standardized tests, and they built their entire system around it, with schools' A-through-F grades, teachers' bonuses and now tenure decisions dependent on how well their students performed on the tests.
By 2009, the passing rates of black students on English exams had narrowed to within 22 percentage points of white students', and within 17 points on the math exams. And charter schools, which predominantly serve black students, were doing so well that one Stanford University researcher proclaimed that they had practically eliminated the ''Harlem-Scarsdale'' gap in math.
But skeptics argued that comparing passing rates was flawed because they did not account for whether a student passed by a little or a lot. In New York City, black and Hispanic students were far more likely to pass with scores barely above the minimum requirement, thereby masking the real difference in performance among groups.
The State Education Department recalibrated the scoring of the tests this year, raising the number of correct answers needed to pass and saying that the previous standards were not accurate measures of what students needed to know at each grade level. When that happened, the passing rates of white and Asian students dropped a little, but those of black and Hispanic students plummeted.
Asian students have generally performed better than white students on state math tests in the city, and about the same on English tests. Those gaps have remained fairly consistent over the years.
While the slow improvement of all groups is ''still a success story,'' Mr. Petrilli said, the achievement gap, which shows how different groups perform relative to one another, still means that most black and Hispanic students will be at a sharp disadvantage when they have to compete against white and Asian peers as they move through schools and into the workplace.
While the gap is not closing, Mr. Klein said he was encouraged that the scores for black and Hispanic students were rising nonetheless.
''Do I wish that we had eliminated the entire achievement gap?'' he said. ''Sure.''

STATE MEASURE: Until state officials raised the passing threshold on state tests this year, the achievement gap in New York City seemed to be steadily narrowing. While the difference in passing rates has now widened, the racial gap in actual scores is still somewhat smaller than in 2002.
NATIONAL MEASURE: On other measures, the performance of elementary and middle school students in the city has been mixed, and the racial gap has remained mostly unchanged. While more black and Hispanic high school students in the city are taking the SAT, their average score is falling.
IMPROVEMENT: But black and Hispanic students are graduating at significantly higher rates than five years ago. (Sources: New York City Department of Education

HEADLINE: South Korea Proposes Tax To Finance Reunification

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea proposed a special tax on Sunday to finance the enormous cost of reuniting with North Korea, as concerns have deepened here over the North's future after the eventual death of its ailing leader.
The proposal broached a delicate issue, and analysts said it could provoke an angry response from the North, which may see it as an aggressive move by the South. 
Although all previous South Korean leaders have advocated rejoining the North, Mr. Lee was the first to propose that the South start saving for the event with a unification tax.
Merging the South's economic powerhouse with the North's impoverished socialist system could impose huge costs on South Korea, analysts say. Those costs have been estimated at a few hundred billion dollars to $1 trillion, according to various South Korean and American research institutes, depending largely on how quickly the countries were integrated.
''Reunification will definitely come,'' Mr. Lee said Sunday in a speech marking the 65th anniversary of the Koreans' liberation from 35 years of Japanese colonial rule. ''I believe that the time has come to start discussing realistic policies to prepare for that day, such as a reunification tax.''
Mr. Lee did not elaborate on what prompted his proposal. But it came as officials and analysts in Seoul contemplated the possibility that the North's leader, Kim Jong-il, could die before a successor gained firm control.
South Korean intelligence analysts said Mr. Kim suffered a stroke in 2008, and he has reportedly been preparing his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, who is believed to be in his late 20s, to be his heir. Unlike Mr. Kim, who had held important party and military posts for years before his own father, President Kim Il-sung, died in 1994, Kim Jong-un holds no known official title.
The North Korean government has recently begun indoctrinating its people with songs and lectures lionizing the son, according to South Korean intelligence officials. Still, the younger man's apparent lack of leadership experience has prompted analysts to speculate about potential instability if Mr. Kim dies suddenly, and the possibility that China might intervene militarily.
Analysts expected an angry North Korean response.
''North Korea will take a unification tax as the expression of a South Korean attempt to prepare for a sudden collapse of the North Korean government,'' said Kim Yong-hyun, an analyst at Dongguk University in Seoul.
Yang Moo-jin, a researcher at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said, ''President Lee should have first reinstalled South-North exchanges and laid the groundwork for the mood for unification before proposing a unification tax.''
South Korea and the United States are to begin another set of joint military exercises on Monday, which the North has denounced as a rehearsal for an invasion. On Sunday, the North's military said it would ''deal a merciless counterblow'' to the United States and South Korea, the official Korean Central News Agency said, promising the most severe punishment ''ever met in the world.''
Inter-Korean relations have chilled to their lowest point in years under Mr. Lee, a conservative who opposed providing aid to the North while it was developing nuclear weapons.
Tensions rose after a South Korean warship was sunk in March and the South, accusing the North of torpedoing the ship, cut off most cross-border trade. Forty-six South Korean sailors were killed in the sinking.
Like his predecessors, Mr. Lee envisioned a gradual unification, with the North's abandonment of its nuclear arms capacity to be followed by extensive economic cooperation that would enable it to narrow the gap between its economy and the South's, which is more than 30 times larger.
''Most South Koreans say they want unification, but they don't necessarily want to pay for it,'' said Mr. Kim of Dongguk University.

HEADLINE: A Family Full of Unhappiness, Still Hoping for Transcendence

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
FREEDOM
By Jonathan Franzen
562 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $28.
Jonathan Franzen's galvanic new novel, ''Freedom,'' showcases his impressive literary toolkit -- every essential storytelling skill, plus plenty of bells and whistles -- and his ability to throw open a big, Updikean picture window on American middle-class life. With this book, he's not only created an unforgettable family, he's also completed his own transformation from a sharp-elbowed, apocalyptic satirist focused on sending up the socio-economic-political plight of this country into a kind of 19th-century realist concerned with the public and private lives of his characters.
Whereas Mr. Franzen's first novel, ''The Twenty-Seventh City,'' borrowed liberally from the likes of Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo to create a dark, splashy picture of a futuristic St. Louis, his 2001 bestseller, ''The Corrections,'' signaled his determination to write an American sort of ''Buddenbrooks,'' to conjure contemporary America -- not by going for a cartoonish, zeitgeist-y epic but by deconstructing a family's history to give us a wide-angled portrait of the country as it rumbled into the materialistic 1990s. 
While ''The Corrections'' attested to Mr. Franzen's discovery of his own limber voice and tamed his penchant for sociological pontification, the novel was something of a hybrid in which the author's satiric instincts and misanthropic view of the world sometimes seemed at odds with his new drive to create fully three-dimensional people. It felt, at times, as if he were self-importantly inflating the symbolic meaning of his characters' experiences, even as he condescendingly attributed to them every venal quality from hypocrisy and vanity to paranoia and Machiavellian conniving.
In the opening pages of ''Freedom,'' this dynamic seems even more exaggerated, as we are introduced to members of the Berglund family as an assortment of disagreeable caricatures, who perplex and perturb their neighbors in St. Paul. Known for his ''niceness,'' Walter Berglund is a weak, passive-aggressive husband and father, who weirdly sells out his nature-loving ideals to work with an evil coal company. His wife, Patty, also seems ''nicey-nice'' on the surface, but turns out to be an ill-tempered shrew, who rages at Walter and inexplicably slashes a neighbor's new snow tires. Their cocky teenage son, Joey, is so unhappy at home that he moves out of the house and in with his girlfriend's family next door.
It turns out, however, that these farcical sketches are simply meant to show how the Berglunds might be perceived by outsiders, just as Patty's account of this period of her life, which immediately follows in the book, reflects her own need to filter everything through the prism of her anger and depression. As ''The Corrections'' dramatically demonstrated, Mr. Franzen is extremely adept at depicting those two emotions -- which not just Patty, but nearly every character in this novel suffers from, too, and which all of them trace back to injustices or slights suffered at the hands of their parents.
As the novel proceeds, however, Mr. Franzen delves further into the state of mind of his creations, developing them into fully imagined human beings -- not Nietzschean stereotypes easily divided into categories of ''hard'' (shameless, ambitious brutes) or ''soft'' (pathetic, sniveling doormats); not bitter patsies fueled by ancient grudges, but confused, searching people capable of change and perhaps even transcendence.
We come to understand the dynamics between the earnest and eager-to-please Walter, a good soldier reeling with suppressed rage; and Patty, college athlete turned housewife, who indulges in alcohol and sarcasm to assuage her sense of uselessness and loss. We also come to intimately know Walter's best friend, Richard, a cool, charming musician and compulsive womanizer, whom Patty first fell in love with decades ago and with whom she later has an affair.
Mr. Franzen's repeated allusions to ''War and Peace,'' suggesting that there is some sort of parallel between the Walter-Richard-Patty triangle and the Pierre-Andrei-Natasha triangle in Tolstoy's great classic, are laughably conceited, but he does an agile job of tracing the constantly evolving relationships among his three main characters, as well the dynamics between Walter and Patty, and their two children, Joey and Jessica. He understands the improvised game of emotional dominoes that can play out in families, and the psychological chutes and ladders that can pop up in their lives out of the blue.
From the start of his career with ''The Twenty-Seventh City,'' Mr. Franzen has been ambitious, striving to write a Big American Novel that might capture a national mind-set, and this novel is no exception. Its title, ''Freedom,'' announces a theme that runs like a riptide beneath the narrative -- lots of talk about what liberty means in terms of being free of familial responsibilities and ideological beliefs, and the rootlessness and dislocation that often follow in its wake.
But it is neither this heavy-handed leitmotif nor the twisty, Dickensian plot (which has Walter and Joey getting involved with a ruthless Halliburton-like company) that lends this novel its narrative heft and hold on the reader. Rather, it is Mr. Franzen's characters and his David Foster Wallace-esque ability to capture the absurdities of contemporary life -- where the planet is ''heating up like a toaster oven'' and people use credit cards to buy a pack of gum or a single hot dog (''I mean cash is so yesterday''), where rage among liberals and conservatives alike is scorching the country in the George W. Bush years, and intemperate blog entries and Howard Beale-like outbursts are cheered as expressions of a collective distemper.
Writing in prose that is at once visceral and lapidary, Mr. Franzen shows us how his characters strive to navigate a world of technological gadgetry and ever-shifting mores, how they struggle to balance the equation between their expectations of life and dull reality, their political ideals and mercenary personal urges. He proves himself as adept at adolescent comedy (what happens to Joey after he accidentally swallows his wedding ring right before a vacation with his dream girl) as he is at grown-up tragedy (what happens to Walter's assistant and new beloved when she sets off alone on a trip to West Virginia coal country); as skilled at holding a mirror to the world his people inhabit day by dreary day as he is at limning their messy inner lives.
In the past, Mr. Franzen tended to impose a seemingly cynical, mechanistic view of the world on his characters, threatening to turn them into authorial pawns subject to simple Freudian-Darwinian imperatives. This time, in creating conflicted, contrarian individuals capable of choosing their own fates, Mr. Franzen has written his most deeply felt novel yet -- a novel that turns out to be both a compelling biography of a dysfunctional family and an indelible portrait of our times.

HEADLINE: Wind Turbines Are Coming to New York, and Not Just Offshore

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
For years, New York officials have envisioned powering the region from a set of huge wind turbines in the Atlantic Ocean off Long Island. But well before an offshore wind farm would be up and running, giant turbines may soon be spinning much closer to the city.
Within three years, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey hopes to have five wind towers, each more than 280 feet tall, operating on the west side of New York Harbor. Nearby, the City of Bayonne, N.J., plans to install an equally large turbine to power a sewage-pumping station. Meanwhile, the Department of Veterans Affairs is considering placing wind turbines on or near its hospitals in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
New York, it turns out, is a windy city, well suited for turning stiff breezes into electricity. If open space were not so rare, the city might be a prime spot for harnessing the wind, said Bill Baroni, deputy executive director of the Port Authority.
''Anybody who's ever stood out at the dock in Weehawken waiting for a ferry just knows it's a very windy area,'' Mr. Baroni said. ''Apparently, it's a pretty good place to put windmills.'' 
In 2008, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced his plan to use wind power to help reduce the city's dependence on power plants that run on fossil fuels. So far, there are no large-scale efforts to harness the wind in the city, only token projects like the small turbines on the roof of an apartment building in the Bronx and a wind-powered electronic billboard for Coca-Cola in Times Square.
The city's Economic Development Corporation has been studying the feasibility of putting turbines atop buildings, including a warehouse at the Hunts Point Cooperative Market in the Bronx. But the high hopes rest on a partnership, with utility companies and the New York Power Authority, that has designs on building a wind farm on about 65,000 acres of the Atlantic floor. The New York consortium said at the end of June that it would apply for a 25-year lease on the site, with hopes of generating as much as 700 megawatts of power there by 2016.
While city officials navigate the logistical and political shoals of that ambitious plan, other agencies are pressing ahead on more solid ground.
The Port Authority's proposed project at Port Jersey on the border of Bayonne and Jersey City would be similar, in appearance and purpose, to a wind farm that was built at a sewage-treatment plant in Atlantic City five years ago. The authority is seeking suggestions from companies that might be interested in managing the project on how to set up the turbines. Mr. Baroni said it could be operating by 2013.
When the winds are high, the five turbines would produce as much as 7.5 megawatts -- enough to run at least 2,000 homes, he said. The authority plans to use the power generated to operate the container port there, then to feed the surplus energy into the local power grid, offsetting some of the authority's consumption elsewhere.
''This is a commitment the Port Authority is making to reduce our carbon footprint and be better neighbors,'' Mr. Baroni said. ''It will allow us to both save money and also be good for the environment. Somebody's got to go first, and it's going to be us.''
But the City of Bayonne may tap the wind quicker. Construction of a 262-foot-tall turbine has already begun at a plant operated by the city's Municipal Utilities Authority. That $5.6 million tower, which would be the biggest wind turbine in New Jersey outside of Atlantic City, is expected to start producing more than enough energy to power the plant by September. The city plans to sell the excess power, saving at least $150,000 a year, said Stephen J. Gallo, executive director of the utilities authority.
''It will be iconic,'' Mr. Gallo said. ''It will be the first windmill in New York Harbor. You'll be able to see it from anywhere on the water.''
Both projects in Bayonne would help New Jersey achieve its stated goal of developing 200 megawatts of wind energy onshore by 2020. The state's energy master plan also calls for producing 3,000 megawatts of wind energy offshore within 10 years.
In late 2008, the state's Board of Public Utilities provided $12 million in rebates to three companies that are racing to build the first wind farm 12 miles or more off the coast of New Jersey. At the end of last month, the State Legislature approved a bill that would provide $100 million in tax credits to the developers of offshore wind farms.
But those deepwater projects would cost about twice as much to build as turbines on land, wind-energy developers say. Mr. Baroni declined to say how much the Port Authority expected to spend on the wind farm it plans to build at Port Jersey, but he said New Jersey had already offered $3 million toward the project. The Atlantic City turbines cost $12 million when they were erected in 2005 by Community Energy, a company based in Radnor, Pa.
Brent Beerley, executive vice president of Community Energy, said the Mid-Atlantic Coast was an attractive location for wind farms because the wind tended to be highest when demand for electricity was at its peak. The power produced also does not have to travel far to reach the consumers who pay the most for it, Mr. Beerley said.
''It's a windy site in general, but unlike other wind farms, the time of day and the time of year that the wind blows strongest there matches when consumers use electricity,'' he said. ''We have very strong summer winds and daytime winds.''
The wind power generated in Atlantic City has sold at ''relatively good'' prices, and the project has exceeded its revenue targets so far, Mr. Beerley said. He added that the second important benefit that wind farms generate is federal tax credits, which attract big banks to invest in the projects.
Without that incentive, it would be difficult for private developers to finance a project like the one the Port Authority is proposing. Mr. Beerley, who said his company might bid to build the project, said it appeared to be feasible and potentially beneficial to the metropolitan area.
''It's a real amount of power and it will offset a significant amount of fossil fuel use locally,'' he said.
The idea is not universally popular, though. On July 8, the Board of Freeholders of Monmouth County, N.J., decided to oppose the construction of a wind turbine at a wastewater treatment plant in the Raritan Bay shore town of Union Beach after a resident fanned dissent with a Web site, www.noturbine.com.
And what about the appearance of five fans as tall as 30-story buildings forming a swirling backdrop to the Statue of Liberty?
Mr. Baroni, a former state senator from central New Jersey, said people actually liked to gaze at the big turbines. In Atlantic City, he said, casino-hotel guests often requests rooms that offer a view of the wind farm atop the sewage plant, instead of the ocean and beach.

HEADLINE: Gender Discrimination in the Workplace

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I agree with David Leonhardt that women are disadvantaged in compensation and career advancement when they take time off to raise families (''A Market Punishing to Mothers,'' Economic Scene column, Aug. 4). But I disagree that gender discrimination has largely been eradicated for childless women. 
As an employment lawyer who litigates gender discrimination cases, I know firsthand that old-fashioned discrimination against women is still prevalent -- before, during and after women become pregnant and mothers. Working women are paid less than their male counterparts, excluded from the most interesting and challenging work assignments, arbitrarily denied promotions and regularly experience sexual harassment, even assault, in the workplace.
Discrimination against mothers based on outdated stereotypes about the commitment and ability of mothers to work and parent at the same time is just one form of gender discrimination that pervades women's working life in America. These stereotypes play a greater role than the time women spend out of the workplace while childrearing.
Holding companies accountable for their illegal conduct is one important way to ensure that women, both childless and with children, are given the same benefits and rights as the remaining 49 percent of the population.

HEADLINE: Air-Conditioners That Run When Nobody's Home

BYLINE: By SAM DOLNICK

 BODY:
In a handsome prewar building in Greenwich Village, a tenant struggled to remember the last time she turned off her air-conditioner. Upstairs, a young couple admitted to having let the window unit run for four days while they went out of town for a funeral, thinking it would be nice, amid the July heat wave, to return to a cool apartment.
Another resident of the 160-unit building, on Seventh Avenue between 13th and 14th Streets, says he leaves the air-conditioning on when he goes to work, when he sleeps at his girlfriend's apartment, even when he leaves the country on vacation -- and only partly out of sympathy for his cat, Kitty.
''My A.C. is pretty much running 24/7,'' Kitty's owner, Michael Perlo, a 28-year-old television producer, said with more bravado than guilt. ''Not having to pay for electricity makes me a little bit more reckless.'' 
Forget round-the-clock doormen or views of Central Park. This sweltering summer, the most coveted New York real estate amenity is two little words that in other times can go unnoticed: ''utilities included.'' Mr. Perlo and his neighbors live in a building where not just heat and hot water, but electricity, is part of their monthly rent -- a more-common-than-you'd-think arrangement caused by old-fashioned wiring in which a building has a single ''master meter'' tracking power use rather than individual meters tied to each tenant. They can blast their air-conditioners all summer long without paying a dollar extra.
Con Edison counts about 250,000 apartments across the city, not including public housing projects, that do not have individual meters tracking electricity consumption, compared with roughly 1.75 million that do. One large management company, Cooper Square, estimates that these units expend at least 30 percent more electricity year-round than their counterparts.
So while lucky tenants across the city relax beneath arctic gusts, their landlords and building managers are left to worry whether these weeks of record-challenging heat will break the bank.
And regardless of who pays the electric bills, there is a considerable environmental cost: a 2009 report said that residential buildings account for 39 percent of the city's greenhouse gas emissions, and 40 percent of the energy that buildings use is spent on heating and cooling.
''Using it when you're not home is outright irresponsible and disrespectful of all the rest of us,'' Dan Hendrick of the New York League of Conservation Voters said. ''There's no good way to look at this. The worst thing is, you're warming our climate to cool your apartment for your own comfort.''
But as any introductory economics course might explain, tenants who blast air-conditioners on their landlord's dime are making rational, predictable choices.
''This is Homo economicus coming out in full feather,'' said Prof. Lawrence J. White of New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business. ''When something is free, until some point of satiation, you will take up a lot of it.''
New York State's Energy and Research Development Authority, in part out of concern over the environmental effects of excessive air-conditioning, is planning to offer building owners financial incentives to install ''submeters'' that measure individual consumption, a major construction project that can require a significant upfront expense.
Under an earlier incentive program, the state helped convert 426 buildings in the city over the last decade, said Jeffrey Gordon, a department spokesman.
The new conversion project will focus on submeters, which track individual electricity use but still feed a single utility account paid by the building owner or manager. (Some landlords then charge tenants based on actual consumption.) That is simpler than individual metering and is seen as an improvement over master meters because it introduces a level of accountability, according to state energy officials. Con Edison estimates that there are 30,000 apartments in the city with submeters.
David Kuperberg, the chief executive officer of Cooper Square, compared two co-op buildings he manages on the Upper East Side. Annually, the one with a master meter used 1.38 kilowatt hours per square foot more than the one with submeters, he said, costing an additional $52,000 a year. Over all, Cooper Square's 45 or so master-metered buildings have energy costs 14 to 24 percent higher than their submetered counterparts, Mr. Kuperberg said.
But installing submeters almost always sets off a battle with tenants who are loath to give up what they see as a perk, even if it could lower their rent or maintenance charges.
''Many of these properties have older populations, and some people are scaring them, saying that if you do this your costs are going to go up,'' Mr. Kuperberg said. ''Nothing could be further from the truth.''
Indeed, some tenants in Mr. Perlo's building in the Village have become upset at a submeter plan in the works by the management company, Northbrook Partners.
Mr. Perlo said that Northbrook had agreed to knock $150 off his monthly rent; but some residents fear their air-conditioning habits would surpass that.
''It's the end of an era,'' lamented his neighbor, a telecommuter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering her landlord. ''It was a great treat.''
Northbrook officials declined to discuss the matter.
Two years ago, a similar kerfuffle unfolded at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the famed middle-class enclaves overlooking the East River that had long offered ''free'' -- at least to tenants -- electricity.
Tishman Speyer Properties, which bought the complexes in 2006, announced plans to install individual meters in each unit as part of an effort to reduce energy use by 20 percent.
The news distressed some long-term residents, sparking newspaper articles and blog posts, including one that announced, ''No More Free Electricity.''
Tishman Speyer abandoned the plans amid larger financial problems that ended with a default on the properties.
Danielle, a social worker who asked that her last name not be used, definitely considered free air-conditioning among the ''pros'' for the two-bedroom apartment in Stuyvesant Town that she moved into last month.
She and her roommate have kept their two units running almost constantly ever since, partly for her purse-size dog, who is in the house all day, but also for that moment, after trekking through the sweaty subways and steaming sidewalks of the city in summer, when they open the door and get to feel a chill.
''I don't want to walk into a hot apartment at the end of the day,'' Danielle said, simply. ''It's nice to not have to worry about it.''

HEADLINE: Economy Led Americans to Limit Use of Routine Health Services, Study Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The economic crisis in the United States has reduced the use of routine medical care, and the cutbacks here are much deeper than in countries with universal health care systems, researchers say in a new report.
The study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, finds that ''Americans, who face higher out-of-pocket health care costs, have reduced their routine medical care'' much more than people in Britain, Canada, France and Germany.
Individuals and families in all five countries lost income because of unemployment and lost wealth because of steep declines in stock prices. 
''We find strong evidence that the economic crisis -- manifested in job and wealth losses -- has led to reductions in the use of routine medical care,'' the researchers said.
''Reductions in care were far greater in the United States than elsewhere,'' they said, in part because about 15 percent of Americans are uninsured, whereas the other countries have near-universal coverage.
The research was done by Annamaria Lusardi, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College; Daniel J. Schneider, a doctoral student in sociology at Princeton University; and Peter Tufano, a professor at Harvard Business School. They analyzed data from surveys designed with their help and conducted in all five countries by TNS, a global market research concern.
Among Americans responding to the survey, they said, 26.5 percent reported reducing their use of routine medical care since the start of the global economic crisis in 2007.
This proportion dwarfs the comparable numbers for other countries: 5.3 percent in Canada, 7.6 percent in Britain, 10.3 percent in Germany and 12 percent in France.
''Even in countries with universal coverage, individuals pay some medical care costs out of pocket,'' the researchers noted.
Cutbacks were generally correlated with the size of out-of-pocket costs, the researchers found. The proportion of people reporting reductions in routine care was smaller in Britain and Canada, where the co-payments are lower, than in France and Germany, where somewhat larger co-payments are required.
In general, the researchers said, reductions in the use of routine medical care were most likely to occur among young people, those with lower incomes and those who had lost large proportions of their wealth in the latest economic turmoil.
Several provisions of the new health care law, signed by President Obama in March, could counter the trend described in the report.
By 2019, the law is expected to provide coverage for more than 30 million people who are uninsured. The law would subsidize coverage for people with incomes up to four times the poverty level ($88,200 a year for a family of four), and insurers will generally be forbidden to charge deductibles or co-payments for recommended preventive services, like mammograms, colonoscopies and immunizations.
Ralph A. Catalano, a professor of public health at the University of California, Berkeley, said the findings of the new study were plausible.
''Discretionary health care, like other discretionary spending, is likely to go down in difficult economic times,'' Mr. Catalano said. ''And you see a bigger effect where there are higher out-of-pocket costs. We do not know how much of the forgone health care will result in serious illness.''
The new research is also consistent with findings of the American Hospital Association, which said its members were still seeing lingering effects of the recession.
''About 70 percent of hospitals report fewer patient visits and elective procedures as family budgets remain tight and patients continue to delay or forgo care,'' the association said in June.

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Rules Against European Union on Tariffs for Electronics

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
GENEVA (Reuters) -- A World Trade Organization panel gave broad backing on Monday to the United States, Japan and Taiwan in their complaint over European duties on electronics products, and told Brussels to bring its trade measures into line with international rules. 
The panel said the European Union had imposed the duties on flat-panel displays, multifunction printers and television set-top boxes in violation of the W.T.O.'s Information Technology Agreement.
The European Commission had already criticized the 704-page ruling before it was published, repeating its view that negotiations on a comprehensive revision of the agreement were preferable to litigation on only a few aspects of it.
''The report does not establish general principles that would imply any form of generalized conclusions,'' it said in a statement. ''Negotiations are the vehicle for mutually beneficial liberalization.''
But it remains to be seen how seriously the European Union's partners will take the call for negotiations on a revised agreement when they believe Brussels is not even living up to the existing one.
Japan's minister of economy, trade and industry, Masayuki Naoshima, welcomed the ruling and called on the European Union to remove the illegal tariffs immediately.
And the United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, said the United States had won an important victory.
''This ruling affirms the principle that changes in technology are not an excuse to apply new duties to products covered by the Information Technology Agreement,'' Mr. Kirk said in a statement.
The parties now have 60 days in which to appeal, but the European Commission said Brussels had not yet decided whether to do so.
The Information Technology Agreement, which is voluntary, abolished tariffs among 72 countries on products like computer screens and printers to foster trade in high-tech goods.
But the European Union argued that added functionality since the agreement was reached in 1996 meant that some products were now consumer goods rather than information technology, and so were not entitled to the zero tariffs under the deal.
For instance, it said flat-panel computer displays could also now serve as television screens.
The United States Information Technology Industry Council also welcomed the ruling and said it was encouraging that Taiwan and Japan had fully backed the United States.

HEADLINE: Summertime, and Indexes Tread Water

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Investors found little reason to buy stocks on Monday as the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended barely changed, suggesting that even several days of losses had not convinced institutions that prices were attractive. 
A smattering of strength in technology shares bolstered the Nasdaq modestly, but volume on the combined NYSE Arca, Nasdaq and American Stock Exchanges was the second-lightest daily volume of the year.
''Trading volume remains anemic as traders and portfolio managers found little reason to get excited enough to make a decision,'' said Scott Fullman, director of derivative investment strategy at the WJB Capital Group.
The biggest losers were education stocks, which tumbled on concerns federal regulators would impose tighter controls on student loans.
Corinthian Colleges lost 21.62 percent, to $5.22, and was one of the most actively traded on the Nasdaq. Strayer Education plummeted 18.37 percent, to $163.26, and Capella Education slumped 13.19 percent, to $60.94.
Those expecting a rebound after four days of losses were also disappointed by early economic releases that suggested more weakness in housing and regional manufacturing.
Reflecting growing fears of deflation, Treasury prices rose, with the 10-year yield hitting a 17-month low. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note climbed 30/32, to 100 17/32. The yield fell to 2.56 percent, from 2.67 percent late Friday.
''There is no catalyst for the market as economic indicators only pile up on the negative side,'' said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.14 points, or 0.01 percent, to 10,302.01. The S.& P. 500 rose 0.13 point, or 0.01 percent, to 1,079.38. The Nasdaq composite index was up 8.39 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,181.87.
On the Nasdaq, Cisco Systems, the maker of Internet network equipment, gained 2.57 percent, to $21.91, after it suffered losses last week on its financial results.
Intel rose 1.67 percent, to $19.47.
Lowe's, the home improvement chain, edged up 0.56 percent, to $19.70, after forecasting an increase in same-store sales of about 2 percent for the fiscal year.
Home builder sentiment unexpectedly fell for a third consecutive month in August to its lowest level since March 2009, according to an industry survey.
A gauge of manufacturing in New York State was up in August, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said, but a new orders component index fell below zero for the first time since June 2009, an early sign of a slowdown.

HEADLINE: Going Green, Gradually

BYLINE: By MARTHA C. WHITE

 BODY:
Hotels eager to satisfy the growing desire of business travelers for eco-friendly lodging are finding that their environmental ambitions have run headlong into the harsh realities of the recession.
When the economy was thriving, developers were promoting environmental flourishes like roof gardens, floors of reclaimed wood, and solar panels. When the Orchard Garden Hotel opened in San Francisco in 2006, it featured furniture made from sustainably grown wood.
But now, with reduced operating budgets, hotel owners are putting off the kind of sweeping projects that were common during the bull market and instead focusing on smaller environmental initiatives that don't cost as much and may even save money at the same time. 
''Big-ticket items that have long-term return on investment have definitely been put on the back burner,'' said Steve Faulstick, general manager of the Doubletree Hotel in Portland, Ore., and a board member of the Green Meeting Industry Council. ''We'd love to be completely green and sustainable, but we're not going to do that at the expense of laying people off.''
The lodging industry is still working its way through a prolonged slump. Hotel occupancy rates have recovered a bit from the trough of 2009, especially at business hotels in big cities. But they remain depressed over all, and average occupancy for all domestic hotels in the second quarter was 60.7 percent, compared with the 69.3 percent the industry enjoyed in the third quarter of 2000, according to STR Global. This makes it extraordinarily difficult for hotels to pay for big-ticket green renovations, especially with a tight credit market.
''The traditional sources of that financing, which are local and regional banks, are stressed by their commercial real estate exposure,'' said David Loeb, senior research analyst at the investment firm Robert W. Baird & Company.
This curb on green projects comes even as a growing number of corporations are reviewing a hotel's green credentials when they solicit bids for contracts. In a business climate where trips and meetings are subject to greater scrutiny, companies are ''really trying to look like good corporate citizens,'' said Nancy J. Wilson, principal of MeetGreen, a company that plans events along eco-friendly guidelines.
The technology company Cisco asks hotels about several areas of environmental awareness, like recycling protocol, the use of eco-friendly housecleaning products and water conservation. Those with programs addressing at least five categories are identified on the company's in-house travel booking tool with a green leaf symbol, said Pam Honeycutt, Cisco's travel manager for the Americas and Europe.
Evaluating a hotel's operational impact on the environment is difficult given the lack of an industry standard, she said. ''There's not one definition of what a green hotel would be,'' she said. ''They all get there by doing multiple things.''
To address this demand without going into the red, hotels are looking at what Mr. Faulstick calls ''low-hanging fruit.'' Lacking the capital to sink into big expensive, retrofits, hotels are turning to small-scale conservation programs that will satisfy corporate buyers. As a bonus, many of these programs also reduce their energy and water bills.
This includes practices such as training staff to switch off lights and televisions, encouraging guests to embrace less-frequent sheet and towel changes and installing lower-cost fixtures like water-conserving showerheads and compact fluorescent light bulbs. ''Low-flow faucets and toilets can bring an immediate savings of 10 to 20 percent,'' Mr. Faulstick said.
Starwood Hotels & Resorts is among those exploring ways to save both money and resources. At its Element brand hotel in Lexington, Mass., energy- and water-efficient products like compact fluorescent light bulbs, Energy Star-rated appliances and low-flow plumbing fixtures in guest rooms save the company about $52,000 annually, according to Brian McGuinness, a senior vice president at Starwood.
Since energy use is the second-largest expense a hotel incurs after salary and benefit costs, practices that reduce this are widely embraced. David Jerome, a corporate responsibility executive with the InterContinental Hotels Group, says the economic downturn accelerated the company's green plans. One program intended only as a pilot is being expanded to the InterContinental's entire portfolio because of the potential cost savings.
Hotels have had to strike a balance, though. They need to simultaneously keep their green initiatives unobtrusive so that guests don't feel inconvenienced, but make them visible enough to satisfy environmentally-conscious travelers.
Bjorn Hanson, dean of the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, said research shows that even guests who say they are environmentally aware won't pay more or accept inconvenience. If bottles of shampoo, conditioner or other items are replaced with wall dispensers, guests complain, he said.
Mr. Jerome said the InterContinental is trying to focus on environmental steps that guests either won't notice or won't mind. ''We don't want the guest to feel like it's all up to them,'' he said. ''We have to balance the guest experience versus the environmental benefits.''
Marriott International is using unobtrusive green elements in a pair of new properties near Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport. The properties, the SpringHill Suites Atlanta Airport Gateway and the Atlanta Airport Marriott Gateway, incorporate low-flow plumbing, water-conserving landscaping and energy-efficient lighting, with an emphasis on natural light.

COPENHAGEN -- How long is too long to be paid to go without a job?
As extended unemployment swells almost everywhere across the advanced industrial world, that question is turning into a lightning rod for governments.
For years, Denmark was held out as a model to countries with high unemployment and as a progressive touchstone to liberals in the United States. The Danes, despite their lavish social welfare state, managed to keep joblessness remarkably low.
But now Denmark, which allows employers to hire and fire at will while relying on an elaborate system of training, subsidies for those between jobs and aggressive measures to press the unemployed into available openings, is facing its own strains. As a result, it is beginning to tighten up.
Struggling to keep its budget under control after the financial crisis, the government in June cut into its benefits system, the world's most generous, by limiting unemployment payments to two years instead of four. Having found that recipients either get work right away or take any job as their checks run out, officials are also redoubling longstanding efforts to move Danes more quickly out of the safety net. 
''The cold fact is that the longer you are out of a job, the more difficult it is to get a job,'' Claus Hjort Frederiksen, the Danish finance minister, said during an interview. ''Four years of unemployment is a luxury we can no longer allow ourselves.''
In the United States, where the Senate passed an unemployment insurance extension last month only after a long battle, the debate over how to treat persistent joblessness has mounted as well.
It pits those who argue that decent benefits are necessary to support workers and their families when companies are doing little hiring against those who contend that longer benefits periods discourage job-seeking. Another fight is brewing over putting more federal dollars toward retraining.
Similar concerns loom in debt-ridden countries like Spain and Portugal, where the costs of high long-term unemployment have governments straining for a solution.
Such European countries could profit, many economists say, from adopting the more dynamic parts of Denmark's ''flexicurity'' system. But now that the global recession has exposed chinks in its armor, Denmark's efforts to find a new balance between job market flexibility and security for workers are setting off alarm bells in the country.
''We have a famous flexicurity model, but now it's all flex and no security,'' complained Kim Simonsen, chairman of HK, one of Denmark's largest trade unions.
To be sure, Denmark is not abandoning the welfare state. Government spending accounts for about half of gross domestic product, and few Danes complain about a top income tax rate of 50 percent that generously finances unemployment, pensions, health care and other accoutrements that, studies claim, make Danes the happiest people on earth.
Hardly anyone in Denmark, a small, tranquil country of 5.5 million people, falls through the cracks. The constitution even guarantees Danes the right to work and to receive public assistance if they stumble. But sustaining a benevolent nanny state is proving to be challenging even for the notably generous Danes.
''It's no surprise the government is saying that programs that are highly expensive and give a Rolls-Royce treatment to citizens have to be trimmed,'' said Iain Begg, a professor at the London School of Economics. ''So the search will now be on for labor market policies that deliver more people in work with less money, which has an inevitable air of the holy grail about it.''
In Denmark, employers have carte blanche to hire and fire, and in most cases laid-off people are guaranteed about 80 percent of their wages in benefits, a figure capped for high earners. In turn, they must participate in retraining and job placement programs tailored to get them back to work, which the government has intensified.
Each year, a remarkable 30 percent of Danes change jobs, knowing the system will allow them to pay rent and buy food so they can focus on landing a new position. About 80 percent belong to unions, which manage the workplace, help run the unemployment insurance program and press the laid-off into retraining.
But as the financial crisis erased jobs, the government, Denmark's largest employer, has had to provide more temporary work and intensify coaching. Unemployment is at 4.2 percent today, lower than most European countries, though more than twice the 1.7 percent rate two years ago.
As in Germany and some other European countries, hundreds of Danish employers have also embraced government-subsidized short-work programs, a tactic adopted to keep a lid on unemployment. The plans allow companies to cut working hours to hold onto highly skilled workers, rather than laying them off when times are tough.
Danish politicians say their program is still working well.
But unions argue that the cutbacks in the safety net go too far, and they are planning to press companies to lengthen the typical one- to three-month notice period before dismissals.
Business leaders fear that would push Denmark toward the type of rigid systems found in Spain, Italy and France, where it can take a year or more to lay off most employees, which drains finances and raises the danger of more job cuts.
''If unions start requiring longer job-cut notices in exchange for reduced benefits, you'll lose the flexibility to adapt to changes in the economy,'' said Stine Pilegaard Jespersen, head of labor market policy at the Danish Chamber of Commerce.
Inger Skouby, at 58 a longtime nurse, has seen the system shift from the inside. She was in and out of unemployment for nearly four years after she fell ill. She took a year off for treatment, paid for by the state. She then tapped jobless pay, receiving about 80 percent of her former wage.
To get with the times, she received information technology training, leading to a telemarketing position until the financial crisis hit.
When she returned to unemployment, she said, the government had tightened up, requiring weekly job applications, meetings with job counselors, and repetitive training that produced scant results. She was put into a work program as a school secretary, until something better came along.
Many others spoke in interviews about being required to take make-work or menial jobs that have eroded their morale.
''Before, it wasn't like this,'' Mrs. Skouby said. ''Now, it's about controlling people.''
Lisbeth Halvorsen, 30, had her first brush with unemployment last month, after her part-time teaching job expired. She will get 70 percent of her salary, but is frantically sending resumes to get out of the system as soon as possible.
The government has created a lot of incentive to do so, she said. To improve its job activation program, Denmark has outsourced some of it to private companies, which receive bonus payments for every person placed into job training or a new job.
That has led to cases where laid-off workers spend an entire month in courses to improve their resumes, or tied up in ''sit-around-and-drink-coffee meetings'' to obtain unemployment checks.
Occasionally, they offend Danish sensibilities. Torben Frederiksen, 32, a plumber out of work for three months, said his employment center forbade him from attending his mother's funeral because it conflicted with a meeting with his counselor.
''They told me that a funeral was no excuse for missing my appointment,'' he said. Mr. Frederiksen went anyway, and was granted another meeting.
From the perspective of Claus Hjort Frederiksen, the finance minister, Denmark is carefully laying the groundwork for the future by changing its policies to make more people eligible for work when the economy picks up.
''In two years, we expect to be out of the crisis,'' he said, ''and we'll need to be ready.''

HEADLINE: 'Besotted' At Pebble, Perfectly The Norm

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. -- On the eve of the 60th annual Concours d'Elegance, a tribal gathering of the world's richest and most serious vintage car collectors, Keith Bowley, an automobile restorer from the Cotswolds, was pondering the glittering rock star in his midst: a limited-edition $2.5 million Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport.
''It's not a matter of 'I've got this' and 'I've got that,' '' Mr. Bowley said of the billionaires and millionaires who fly here from all parts of the globe in the hope of being crowned -- like a Scottish terrier at the Crufts Kennel Club Championship -- ''Best in Show.'' He paused. ''One is besotted.'' 
The Concours, or Pebble as it is known, is an alternate universe in which California car culture and the sort of people who can afford to buy, restore and impeccably maintain a 1936 Alfa Romeo or a 1938 Jaguar SS100 Roadster converge, on a verdant 18th fairway.
The travails of Detroit and the economic meltdown seem to disappear in a poof of bonnets and piped-in concertos and an over-the-top sartorial tendency to color-coordinate with one's auto.
The event Sunday, which drew 50,000 participants and spectators (entry: $175 a ticket), was the grand finale of a frenetic classic car week that included vintage sports car races, an 80-mile tour and the high-roller RM Auction in Monterey, in which collectors -- mostly men -- shelled out a total of $68 million for couture cars that twirled like models on a runway.
Some 255 entries and 29 classes of cars were assembled along with their famous gearhead fans, like Jay Leno, whose latest obsessions are chronicled on jaylenosgarage.com, and collectors like Sam Mann of Englewood, N.J., inventor of widely used ear piercing devices, who has won ''Best of Show'' four times. Mr. Mann's friendly rival is Jack Nethercutt, a six-time winner and the chairman and president of Merle Norman Cosmetics Inc., whose family has an eponymous automotive museum in Sylmar, Calif. Like many other men here, he wore a Panama hat.
''You're up against the finest cars in the world,'' Mr. Nethercutt said of the competition, a no-nonsense affair where judges with clipboards inspect each well-preserved car nose to tail for its authenticity, like a cosmetic surgeon inspecting a dermatologist's Botox work.
''Everything has to be pure,'' Mr. Nethercutt said. ''It can't just be a pretty car.''
Spectators pose in front of million-dollar Duesenbergs and Rolls-Royces like tourists at Mount Rushmore.
Here, where many cars get eight miles to the gallon, a loudspeaker announcement, ''Will Willie Snyder please return to his Duesenberg!'' does not seem surreal.
The event has its roots in the Paris of the 1920s, when high modern furniture was exhibited as art and automobile design was becoming fashionable, said Christian Overland, the vice president of collections at the Henry Ford auto museum in Dearborn, Mich. The exhibitions evolved into a show called Concours d'Elegance, or ''Parade of Elegance.'' Today the Pebble Beach extravaganza is the creme de la creme of about 20 such shows in the United States alone.
''It is a combination of art, fashion, culture and technology that inspires hobbyists the way Major League Baseball inspires amateurs,'' Mr. Overland said.
DeNean Stafford of Tifton, Ga., a heavy-machinery dealer, was there with his 1910 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost Double Pullman Limousine, which still had the original turquoise needlepoint on its doors and was painted a rich burgundy. He does not consider his six Rolls-Royces to be ''a large collection,'' he said, but he spends about $100,000 a year to maintain each one, employing, like many here, a full-time collection manager, whose duties include driving.
''Cars are like people,'' said Stan Carpenter, the collection manager. ''They get stiff if they don't exercise.''
Robert M. Lee of Lake Tahoe, Nev., the founder of Hunting World and a safari pioneer, displayed a 1931 V16 Cadillac with a body by Pininfarina, made, he said, for the maharajah of Orchha with six gun compartments for hunting.
It was not the stuff of Click & Clack.
When not discussing hose clamps or dual-coil ignition systems, much of the car talk here involved comparisons to the art market and what cars were fetching at the five auctions this week.
''People go look at a Picasso,'' said Robert Pass, president of the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Museum in Auburn, Ind., summing up the prevailing attitude. ''But you can't drive it.''
Matt de Lorenzo, the editor of Road & Track, said serious collectors ''were still paying serious money for serious cars,'' like the two rare Ferraris that sold for $4.6 million each at the RM Auction.
Only prices for muscle cars, which skyrocketed four years ago, remained weak. Drew Berlin, a vintage guitar broker from Los Angeles with coiled hair and dark glasses, had just sold a 1970 Pontiac GTO 455 HO convertible for $60,000. It was valued at $180,000 four years ago, Mr. Berlin said, attributing the fall to ''dot-com versus old money.''
Gerry Martel, an appraiser from Boston, said the market for Duesenbergs had also dropped. ''No one under age 60 wants them,'' Mr. Martel observed. ''I don't think I've ever seen a Duesenberg with an iPod.''
Still, cars like an experimental 1955 Ghia Gilda Streamlined X Coupe, which had a jet engine that shook the ground, wowed the crowd. (Named for a Rita Hayworth role, it gave off a lot of heat.)
''You see the rarest of the rare,'' Mr. Leno observed after studying the engine of a tubular-looking silver 1938 Tatra Type 77a Limousine. ''It's cheaper than crack or hookers,'' he said of his hobby. ''When you come home reeking of transmission fluid, your wife knows where you've been.''

HEADLINE: Aisle by Aisle, an App That Pushes Bargains

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
It's like the most persistent sales clerk you've ever encountered.
Major retailers are working with a new smartphone application that tracks and offers promotions to shoppers as they move from outside the store, to counters, to cash registers -- even inside the dressing room (now that's persistence).
The app, called Shopkick, will be available on Tuesday for the iPhone and in the fall for Android phones. And with five major companies supporting it -- Macy's, Best Buy, Sports Authority and American Eagle Outfitters, along with the Simon Property Group, the prominent mall operator -- it is getting a big introduction. 
Customers with the Shopkick app will get points (called kickbucks) for entering a store. Pick up a putter at Sports Authority, and points drop into the app. Stop in the dressing room at American Eagle, and more points arrive.
The points are redeemable for gift cards at the retailers, along with music downloads or credits toward Facebook games. It takes a lot of points, however, to earn even a $5 gift card, although the stores say they may adjust the point system to make points more valuable.
Whether shoppers will get a kick, so to speak, out of being followed -- and pinged from one floor of a store to the next -- remains debatable. What retailers see as sophisticated marketing, privacy advocates see as intrusive. Shopkick knows ''where you are, what you buy, your spending habits, passions, excesses,'' Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, said via e-mail.
Unlike apps like Foursquare, Shopkick tells retailers when users are inside, not just near, a store.
''That's unusual,'' said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''Will it lift sales? That remains to be seen, but everyone is eager to experiment.''
The app lets stores ''influence their behavior,'' said Mikael Thygesen, who is the chief marketing officer at the Simon Property Group and the president of its Simon Brand Ventures division. Simon, along with the other companies using Shopkick, will install it in stores in and around New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles initially, with Chicago to follow next week.
Before introducing Shopkick, the company's co-founder and chief executive, Cyriac Roeding, tested how willing consumers would be to ''check in'' to a location in exchange for a reward -- in that case, money for charities. That app, called CauseWorld, was introduced in December 2009 and was downloaded more than 550,000 times in its first five months, with almost $1 million going to charities so far. Ms. Mulpuru called it ''a success story of the retail-app world.''
Shopkick goes further.
On Monday, Mr. Roeding stood on a slim strip of sidewalk on 46th Street in Manhattan, trying to avoid Times Square tourists as he demonstrated the app. As he stood a few yards from the entrance to an American Eagle Outfitters store, the app showed him all the nearby stores where he could check in -- including American Eagle or the tiny candy store nearby. For each check-in -- which did not require him to actually go inside -- he could receive 0 to 2 points.
That was fine, but ''foot traffic is so important,'' Mr. Roeding said. ''Why does no one ever reward anyone for visiting a store?'' By actually going inside the American Eagle store, the app told him, he could earn 35 kickbucks. The app knows someone is in a store by listening for an audio transmitter placed in each participating store; the phone's microphone picks up the signal, which people cannot hear.
Once inside, Mr. Roeding swiped through offers: a 15 percent discount, a sale on jeans. Enter a dressing room -- once a shopper tries on clothes, sales rise, retailers know -- and posters on the walls offer points for scanning the bar code.
''It's the first reward programs for desired behaviors,'' Mr. Roeding said.
Shopkick earns a small fee for each kickbuck a customer earns. If a customer buys something after using the app, Shopkick gets a percentage of the price.
Right now, it takes a lot of kickbucks to earn anything -- a $5 gift card at American Eagle requires 1,250 kickbucks. And retailers limit the number of eligible visits each day, so someone cannot sprint in and out of Best Buy all afternoon.
Soon, the retailers say, they hope to become more sophisticated, giving points or promoting items based on sex or age, where people live, how frequently they shop or their buying history.
The companies can even weave in rewards-card numbers, as Best Buy is already doing. With that, ''we have the ability to target down to even an individual level,'' said Mike Dupuis, the vice president for marketing and operations at American Eagle Outfitters Direct, the Web and mobile division of American Eagle.
Privacy advocates like Mr. Chester said that was problematic, especially given how that data could be combined with other available information about consumers, and that Shopkick's privacy policy was too broad.
''What appears to be a relatively harmless trade-off of your information for rewards or discounts is really misleading,'' he said.
Mr. Roeding said he believed that because consumers had to turn on the app, the privacy problems were minimal. ''The device does not detect your phone, the phone detects your device,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Cites Concerns In China Military Growth

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- China has increased spending on a military that is becoming larger and more effective even as Beijing has rebuffed exchanges with the Defense Department that could improve stability, according to a Pentagon study released Monday.
Senior Pentagon officials acknowledged that much of the Chinese military modernization program may reflect the rational ambition of a rising global power, albeit one that may be a worrisome rival to American interests in the Pacific region.
But across the American government -- from the White House to the Pentagon to Congress -- officials express concern that China's lack of openness about the growth, capabilities and intentions of its military injects instability to a vital region of the globe. 
China's overall spending on national defense for 2009 was estimated at $150 billion, an increase of 7.5 percent but only about one-fifth of what the Pentagon spent to operate and carry out the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the study, required each year by Congress.
China's arsenal of missiles arrayed across a strait from Taiwan, an American ally considered a wayward province by Beijing, did not substantially grow in numbers but is being upgraded to be more capable, according to the review.
Of the many potential points of conflict, Taiwan remains the most notable, as China froze military-to-military relations with the Defense Department earlier this year after an announcement that the United States was selling more than $6 billion in weapons to Taiwan.
Administration officials say that while ties between Washington and Beijing in the areas of diplomacy and economics are improving, the military-to-military relationship is prickly and a reason for concern.
Another cause of worry, according to the study, is China's emphasis on weapons that could deny the ability of American warships to operate in international waters off the coast; those weapons include precision, long-range missiles and a growing fleet of submarines and warships.
The Pentagon study said that China had an active program to develop and build several aircraft carriers, and could start construction by the end of this year. China also appears intent on expanding its arsenal of nuclear-powered submarines, with one missile-launching submarine and several hunter-killer submarines already at sea, all nuclear-powered for greater range. These nuclear-powered submarines are in addition to larger and growing numbers of diesel-powered hunter-killer submarines in the Chinese Navy, according to the study.
Administration and military officials also criticized China's actions beyond its territorial waters, particularly in the South China Sea. Pentagon officials say China's military appears intent on extending claims for maritime jurisdiction beyond the range accepted by international law.
Senior Defense Department officials who released the study declined to be drawn into a discussion of politics, but Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, the Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, expressed a view shared by the Pentagon.
In a statement released Monday, Mr. Skelton said he was concerned by ''ambiguities regarding China's military modernization, including its missile buildup across from Taiwan, its maritime activities in the South China Sea, and the steady increase of its power-projection capabilities, which do not obviously support China's stated national security objectives.''
While ''China has taken some steps toward increasing transparency and openness regarding its defense strategy and expenditures in recent years,'' Mr. Skelton said, ''such steps are modest. China's most recent military budget continues a trend of sustained annual increases, and China's strategic intentions remain opaque.''
The Pentagon review comes as China surpassed Japan in the second quarter of the year to become the world's No. 2 economy, after the United States.

HEADLINE: 2 Zombies To Tolerate For a While

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Representative Barney Frank was furious.
The Massachusetts Democrat had been watching a morning news program that had me on, and soon afterward he was calling my cellphone to fume about that morning's discussion. The topic? Why it has taken the government so long to address the fate of the zombie mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
It is an issue that has been talked about a lot of late. On Tuesday, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, will convene a meeting of government officials and executives like Bill Gross of Pimco and Lewis Ranieri, the father of the mortgage-backed security, to delve into future housing policy and the role played by Fannie and Freddie. 
On the television program that had stirred Mr. Frank, ''Morning Joe'' on MSNBC, the prevailing view was that any effort toward a resolution of Fannie and Freddie -- government-created mortgage companies that were taken over by the government as the financial crisis mounted -- had been put on the back burner during the overhaul of financial regulation. The consensus was that neither Democrats nor Republicans wanted to touch an issue that would dredge up decisions made by both parties over the last decade that looked bad in light of the financial crisis. Fannie and Freddie was now the third rail of American politics.
Mr. Frank was having none of that.
''I take offense at the idea that we've done nothing,'' he told me. Far from dragging its feet, he insisted, the government took the bold step of putting Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship in 2008. ''There was no political fear to not do it.''
I asked the question that I hear from so many Americans: Why hasn't the government tried to unwind and replace Fannie and Freddie, which have so far cost taxpayers $145 billion, more than any other bailed-out firm?
His response was counterintuitive -- and as unsatisfying as it may sound, he's right.
''There is no urgency,'' he said.
Come again?
''We've already abolished Fannie and Freddie,'' he said, referring to the government takeover. ''Yes, we waited too long to fix it. But the money is not being lost by anything they are doing now.''
In other words, the sinkhole that is Fannie and Freddie -- Freddie just said it needed an additional $1.8 billion and the Congressional Budget Office says the combined companies could cost taxpayers $389 billion over the next decade -- is not a function of those firms making new loans that have gone bad, but the continued ''bleeding,'' as Mr. Frank put it, from previous loans made before the crisis that are still going belly-up.
More important, shutting down Fannie and Freddie and having the private market step in, as politically popular a sound-bite as that may be, is economically unfeasible. For better or worse, Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae were behind 98 percent of all mortgages in this country so far this year, according to the Mortgage Service News. Pulling the rug out from under them would be pulling the rug from under the entire housing market as it continues to struggle.
''Nobody in the private market thinks we're ready,'' he said, adding that whatever legislation is developed, it will be ''for a postrecession world.''
That reality, however, is not changing the minds of many who are calling for a return to a private system that doesn't depend on the government to subsidize housing.
One of the more interesting ideas being floated is that the government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie and Freddie, would subsidize loans only for low-income families by lowering the size of a so-called conforming loan. At the moment, Fannie and Freddie are buying up single-family mortgages for up to $417,000, and in some high-cost areas as much as $729,750, clearly benefiting families that don't need the subsidy. Even if the size of a conforming loan were reduced -- a prospect that troubles Mr. Frank -- there will still need to be some sort of support for that marketplace because the big banks say they won't service it.
''A clear government role will be necessary to support lending to lower-income borrowers because it is likely that underwriting standards will become more rigorous and funding for mortgage lending more difficult and costly,'' the deputy general counsel of Bank of America, Gregory A. Baer, wrote in a letter to the Treasury. (Critics of the banks will point to language like that to show why the bailouts are not helping ordinary Americans.)
No matter what the ultimate plan, the transition to get there will be painful.
''Were the G.S.E.'s to cease buying mortgages or guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities, financing for buying homes today would be virtually nonexistent until the banks got back up on their feet. This would result in mortgage prices increasing, causing demand for housing to decrease, taking the value of homes even further down,'' Anthony Randazzo, director of economic research of the Reason Foundation, wrote in a letter to Mr. Geithner.
Nonetheless, Mr. Randazzo, whose foundation leans toward libertarian views, takes a much bolder step. ''This means that prices have not been allowed to reach their natural bottom, from which a sustainable recovery could begin.'' And Mr. Randazzo wants to see housing prices truly bottom out.
But allowing the housing market to collapse simply so it can rise again -- a very free-market approach -- is politically unpalatable, especially as the nation's unemployment number still hovers near 10 percent.
''It's intellectually pretty difficult,'' Mr. Frank said.
