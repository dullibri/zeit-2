HEADLINE: A. H. Raskin, 82, Times Reporter and Editor, Dies

BYLINE: By RICHARD SEVERO

 BODY:
A. H. Raskin, an authority on labor whose articles and editorials ran in The New York Times for more than four decades, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 82.
The cause of death was cancer, said his wife, Marge. 
 Mr. Raskin served The Times as a reporter, editorial writer and as assistant editor of the editorial page.
Informative but never strident or accusatory, Mr. Raskin was noted both for the thoroughness of his research and for the clarity with which he presented his findings, even when they concerned complex economic issues that many readers might find arcane. Some said they believed he was especially searching when writing about inflation.
 
A Remembered Lesson
 On one occasion, Mr. Raskin explained why. In 1924, he said, while his family was living in Seattle, his father, Henry Raskin, a fur trader, decided to spend some time in Russia so that he could buy Siberian furs. Thus, the Raskin family temporarily relocated in Berlin to await visas. When they reached that city, an American dollar was worth 1,000 German marks. A few months later, with postwar Germany suffering under runaway inflation and badgered by its World War I enemies to pay reparations, the Raskins found that a dollar could fetch 4.2 trillion marks. The family never forgot it.
"Never in my later career as a labor writer and analyst," he said, "could I accept with equanimity the notion that 'a little inflation can be a good thing.' "
Mr. Raskin covered, among other things, the travails of desperate people who sought work during the Great Depression and, after World War II, the emergence of labor unions and leaders who had the strength and sophistication to make the American labor movement a formidable force.
He also described some of labor's darkest problems. In 1952 his articles about wrongdoers encouraged the American Federation of Labor to set up a special antiracketeering committee. For his work in this period he won the George Polk Memorial Award, a Page One Award from the Newspaper Guild and an award from the Society of Silurians, a group of professional journalists.
 
A Quip From Hoffa
 But not everyone was always pleased by what he wrote. James R. Hoffa, the head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, told him, "Abe, you're going to scratch yourself on your typewriter one day and die of blood poisoning."
John B. Oakes, editor of The Times's editorial page from 1961 through 1976, recalled that in his editorial writing Mr. Raskin dealt with everything affecting labor in the broadest sense, as well as with a wide range of international and domestic affairs. Mr. Raskin, he said, was the first person he had asked to join his staff as his deputy. He was, Mr. Oakes said yesterday, not only The Times's expert but also a nationally recognized voice in the field of labor and industrial relations.
Mr. Raskin's ability as a reporter to coax stories out of his sources was legend. Stanley Levey, a colleague who also wrote about labor for The Times, called Mr. Raskin "one of the most amazing telephone manipulators since Alexander Graham Bell."
 
Born in Canada
 Abraham Henry Raskin was born on April 26, 1911, in Edmonton, Alberta. After the Berlin adventure, he settled with his family in New York, where he received his secondary-school education at Townsend Harris Hall. In 1927 he entered City College and majored in education and government. He became interested in journalism and edited the student newspaper, yearbook and literary magazine. He was elected president of his senior class and was graduated, Phi Beta Kappa, in the class of 1931.
He remained at City College for a time doing graduate work, mostly because he was unconvinced that any jobs were available, at least jobs that he might want. He furthered his interest in journalism by working as a campus correspondent for The New York Times.
In March of 1934 he joined The Times as a reporter. He was assigned to cover unemployment and the work-relief agencies set up by the Government to see the nation through the Depression. His editors took note of his aggressiveness, and his first byline did not come easily. But almost from the start copy editors noted that Mr. Raskin was usually very accurate, seldom made the same mistake twice and produced copy that required almost no editing. A rarity among reporters of his generation, he even typed well.
In 1940 he filed an exclusive account of David Dubinsky's being assaulted by Joseph S. Fay at a convention of the American Federation of Labor in New Orleans. Mr. Raskin did not see the assault, but his sources within the labor movement were such that he received an accurate account of it. At the time, Mr. Dubinsky was head of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union; Mr. Fay ran the Union of Operating Engineers. Mr. Dubinsky had said some things about labor racketeers that Mr. Fay thought uncharitable. Mr. Raskin's article made page 1 of The Times. In 1977 he wrote with Mr. Dubinsky a memoir called "David Dubinsky: A Life With Labor."
In World War II, Mr. Raskin served as chief of the industrial services division of the Pentagon, a job in which there was one memorable episode.
In April 1944 President Franklin D. Roosevelt was vexed with Sewell Avery, who was president and chairman of Montgomery Ward, the retail merchandising corporation. Mr. Roosevelt wanted Mr. Avery to make peace with a union, as ordered by the War Labor Board.
When Mr. Avery proved intractible, two soldiers under Mr. Raskin's command appeared at his Chicago office and picked him up, still in his chair, and removed him. The Government seized all of Montgomery Ward's offices, held them briefly, then returned them to the company.
In 1946 Mr. Raskin was discharged from the Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel.
After returning to The Times he also acted as a consultant to President Harry S. Truman on universal training, a program the President proposed that would have organized a citizen reserve to reinforce professional armed forces. The plan, which called not for drafting young men but for training them as civilians, was never adopted by Congress. In those same postwar years, Mr. Raskin also helped organize the Defense Department's Division of Industrial Relations.
 
Assessing a Newspaper Strike
 In 1961 he joined the editorial board of The Times and three years later became assistant editor of the editorial page. One of his most notable performances in the 1960's was his lengthy account of the 114-day New York newspaper strike of 1962-63, which appeared in the news pages of The Times in its first issue after the strike ended.
The effort was a journalistic tour de force that provided New Yorkers with a candid appraisal of what the strike had been all about. And although it was critical, in some respects, of some Times executives, it was printed without editorial deletions of sensitive material.
Soon after it was printed, the chief negotiator for The Times resigned. The article was hailed by, among others, James A. Wechsler, who wrote in The New York Post:
"It was a remarkable exercise in many ways -- but perhaps most remarkable because it suggested that not all virtue was on one side in the long struggle and that, in the view of men who had lived through the long days and nights," The Times's management negotiator "had not been a flawless figure."
Mr. Raskin retired from The Times in 1977 but continued to write. For a time, he served as editor of The Journal of International Labor Affairs, published by the Department of Labor. In the autumn of 1990 he had a stroke.
 
A Change in Vocation
 He endured the disabilites that followed with a determination to overcome them, but speech remained difficult if not impossible. In September 1992 the Op-Ed page of The Times carried excerpts from a piece he had written for Martha's Vineyard magazine.
He wrote: "I now realize that my vocation in life has changed. Now I represent the one million Americans who cannot speak for themselves. My plight and theirs are one: to inform the public that those of us who have lost the ability to invent fluent phrases or sentences have not lost the ability to think. We retain the skill to communicate our thoughts and feelings, whether through writing, picture boards, pantomine or facial expression. We can still speak! We hope that you will listen with your ears, with your eyes and always with your heart."
In addition to his wife, Marge, Mr. Raskin is survived by two children from his earlier marriage to Rose Samrock, who died in 1989. They are a son, Donald, and a daughter, Jane Brown. He is also survived by a brother, Bernard Raskin; three stepchildren, Mary Lou Frankel, Jill Isaacs and Geoffrey Campe; three grandchildren, David Raskin, Carolyn Raskin and Sarah Verneuille, and two great-grandchildren.
A service will be held at 11:30 tomorrow morning at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home at 81st Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 24, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about A. H. Raskin, an authority on labor whose articles and editorials ran in The New York Times for more than four decades, misstated his source of information about an assault by Joseph S. Fay on the garment union leader David Dubinsky at a 1940 convention in New Orleans. Mr. Raskin was present and witnessed the attack.

HEADLINE: A Mystery on Every Plate

BYLINE: By Betty Fussell; Betty Fussell is author, most recently, of "The Story of Corn."

 BODY:
"If we are what we eat," as some wit has asked, "what the hell are we?" And how do we find out?
How hard both questions are to answer is dramatized by the Government's recent confession that its bible of food composition, the Department of Agriculture's Handbook 8, is "flawed and unreliable." 
 For a century, the department has been in charge of national nutrition, as it was defined by the science of chemistry in the 1890's. To ask why it should head all our food information, education and assistance programs, from school lunches to food stamps, explains why nutrition, in the midst of a national food and health crisis, remains the Government's orphaned child.
The word nutrition comes from the Latin "to suckle," and for centuries the nourishing and nurturing of families in sickness and in health was woman's work. But a century and a half ago, when America industrialized its food chain, it turned farms into factories, food into commodities, nurturers into "domestic scientists" or "home economists" and babies who were suckled into bottle-fed ones.
At the turn of the century, government, science, industry and technology changed not only what we ate but also how we thought about it. Food was reduced to those physical properties that could be analyzed and synthesized chemically. Chemistry turned corn, our national staff of life, into an industrial raw material equivalent to petroleum. It dictated how we grew our crops, what we fed our animals and how we processed, preserved and distributed all our foods.
America led the world in creating a new chain of nutritionally equivalent synthetic foods. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration first met an astronaut's nutritional needs by assembling in a plastic bag the chemical equivalent of an entree, two side dishes, a dessert and a beverage, which the astronaut was to knead for three minutes and squeeze into his mouth.
With a century of continual change at each link in the food chain and with so many vested interests at stake, it's small wonder that nutritive information continues to be assembled by a hodgepodge of conflicting interests, who then dissemble. As bureaucracies have multiplied, accountability has diminished.
The lack of coordination among the department agencies involved in nutrition is ludicrous. More than 60 million lives each year are affected by Government food programs, including 25 million schoolchildren and 27 million people on food stamps. Yet 13 years after the Agriculture Department issued dietary guidelines on fat, sodium and sugar, virtually no schools conform to them and few welfare recipients follow them.
The medical establishment, focusing on pathology and chemical treatment by drugs, has long equated diet with what's put on hospital trays. Even today, when five of America's major health problems -- heart, liver, cancer, diabetes and cerebrovascular diseases -- have been proved to be related to diet, just 23 percent of American medical schools require a course in nutrition, and many offer none.
We need new collaborations like the one devised by Dr. Steven Zeisel at the University of North Carolina, where he has linked the School of Medicine with the School of Public Health to form a shared nutrition department, the country's first, and to develop a pilot program, "Nutrition in Medicine," for medical schools.
Medicine needs to move with speed toward the goal of prevention. In the debate over health reform, watchdog agencies like the Center for Science in the Public Interest point out that surgery is far costlier than proper diet and that Americans spend $17 billion a year on bypass operations alone.
Mike Espy is the first Agriculture Secretary in memory to call for reform and make nutrition "a priority mission." In recruiting Ellen Haas, formerly head of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, to be Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Food and Consumer Services, and in proposing to elevate that position to Under Secretary of Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, he has put his money where his mouth is. As Ms. Haas says, Espy has "a bold new plan to reinvent a bureaucracy which has remained largely unchanged since it was founded by Abraham Lincoln."
The Government should finance long-term nutrition research and education. While the Agriculture Department's budget for analyzing the 5,000 foods in Handbook 8 is $200,000 a year, Kellogg spends $28 million a year to promote a single product, Pop Tarts.
We have to acknowledge that what anyone puts in the ground, on a plant, in an animal or in a processed food -- pesticide, radiation, hormone or excessive additive -- eventually affects communal health.
The food industry must take responsibility for the consequences of the blitz of TV ads it aims at children, recognize that a junk food diet affects health adversely and promote a healthy diet for kids. Health, like the environment, is everybody's business.
In the professional food community, the split between hard-core hedonists and puritanic healthies, which began in the gastronomic revolution of the 1960's, is at last being bridged. Spearheaded by Julia Child, the American Institute of Wine and Food's national program "Taste and Health" is promoting culinary and nutritional education at all levels. The International Association of Cooking Professionals is focusing on ways to enhance nutrition in restaurant food. Most recently, Assistant Secretary Ellen Haas has enlisted celebrity chefs to help teach kids about good food while feeding them good-tasting lunches.
Ironically, national attention is finally being paid to chemical information about food at the very moment biotechnology is rendering much of that information irrelevant by restructuring food at its DNA source. Now more than ever, food safety and wholesomeness is everyone's concern and should not be left simply to the already overburdened and underfunded Food and Drug Administration.
Everyone who wants to know what we are needs hard, clear, objective information about what we put in our mouths.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Deficit Cuts: Success Gets Little Notice

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
There was a time not long ago when the capital was consumed by the budget deficit, by the fear that it would exceed $300 billion and by intense partisan attacks as each party blamed the other and said the other guy's solutions were no better than snake oil.
Honest, there was. But was that the same city where Leon E. Panetta, the budget director, announced this week that the Clinton Administration's first real budget would put the deficit at about $190 billion instead of the $302 billion projected by President George Bush, and hardly anybody noticed? 
 Nobody was issuing press releases of praise, or assailing dubious bookkeeping the way they usually do.
 
A Much-Doubted Promise
 Does that mean that nobody in Washington gets excited, or even interested, except by political bloodshed or impending disaster? President Clinton is hardly the first President to complain that no one here notices success, even something that looks like a big first step toward meeting a much-doubted and now rarely mentioned campaign promise to cut the deficit in half by the end of what he hopes will be called his first term.
By some definitions, of course, Mr. Panetta's pronouncement was not very big news. The steep reduction from the Bush figure came from last summer's tax increases. And this week's $190 billion figure was not much below his last guess of about $200 billion, with the difference coming not from a new degree of sacrifice in spending but from somewhat better economic projections.
At one level, the announcement meant no more than that the Government was keeping its word and abiding by the budget law passed last summer -- though this is no small matter, since the law barred any overall increase in discretionary spending, not even an inflation allowance. As one phlegmatic Republican aide said: "I don't see anything special. They did what they said they would."
Wait a second! Ever since deficits first topped $100 billon in 1982, Congress and Presidents have been enacting laws that they said would cut the deficit. They were wrong. But if Mr. Panetta's projections hold up, the budget deficit will have been reduced for three years in a row. The last time the Government's balance sheet improved for even two consecutive years was 1947 and 1948.
 
Worries for Democrats
 Of course, the budget for the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1 has not been formally proposed yet, and when it is it will not be easy to pass. But because the White House and Congress are both in Democratic hands, the proposal will be treated more seriously on Capitol Hill than most Reagan and Bush budgets were. Indeed, that is what worries some Democrats, like those who fear cuts in mass transit operating subsidies will have more credibility if they are proposed by a Democrat rather than a Republican.
It was not easy to follow the law and hold the spending level. Mr. Panetta spoke of "very tough decisions." Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, put it less gently, saying, "There was blood all over the floor as they said, 'No, you can't do this; you can't do that.' "
There are lots of reasons this accomplishment caused only faint ripples. Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, said the press was at fault. He said that when he told people last week that the deficit for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 was $254.9 billion instead of the $327.3 billion projected by Mr. Bush, his constituents flat out did not believe him.
"They haven't seen it in the newspapers, and they haven't seen it on television," he said. "The news media in general have decided that what they will do is peddle information that maintains audience rather than what conveys information." As a result, he says, "the public will believe no good news about government."
 
The 'Sinking In' Factor
 Senator Moynihan offers another explanation, though he does believe the new budget will be evidence that "some progress has been made," both because the budget vote "sent the right signal" and because the Federal Reserve Board has held interest rates down.
But, he said, "It took five years, if not 10 years, for it to sink in that the U.S. Government was running regular, huge and growing deficits. Then it sank in." Now, he said, "If we in fact get ourselves into a reverse mode, it's going to take some time for people to say it's getting better."
Not without reason. When Republicans charged that only the tax increases in Mr. Clinton's bill would be real and that Congress would use them for more spending, it struck a ready chord with the public. In August, a Gallup Poll for the Cable News Network and USA Today showed that only 38 percent of Americans said the bill would cut the deficit. Fifty-five percent said it would not.
Even so, when the Government begins to keep its word on the budget, perhaps it is something to remark on.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Steady Against Yen But Dips in Other Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar steadied against the Japanese yen yesterday and drifted lower against other leading currencies in slow trading. Markets closed early for the Christmas weekend.
Currency markets in the United States and in many other nations will be closed today. 
 A fresh batch of upbeat economic reports did not have much influence on the United States currency yesterday, which stayed within tight ranges relative to its foreign counterparts.
The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods rose 2 percent in November, a slightly higher rate than expected. It also said that personal income rose six-tenths of a percent in November while spending rose four-tenths of a percent.
Gold prices were mostly lower. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in February, the most actively traded contract, closed at $387 an ounce, down 20 cents from Wednesday.
Earl Johnson, a vice president of Harris Trust and Savings Bank, said trading was uneventful despite reports confirming that the nation's economic expansion gained momentum as the year drew toward a close.
"There was no incentive to trade in this market," Mr. Johnson said. "I think the sentiment is still bullish for the dollar, but it will be the new year before people start acting on it."
Traders typically hold back from staking out new positions during holiday periods when light trading can skew movements in the markets.
Dollar trading was also abbreviated yesterday because markets were closed in Japan for the Emperor's birthday, a national holiday.
The dollar was quoted at 110.60 yen in London and moved to 110.68 yen in New York, up from 110.40 yen late Wednesday. It appeared to be steadying after a wild week in which it was buffeted by speculation about whether the United States would support the yen with purchases of it.
The British pound rose to $1.5034 late in London from $1.4946 Wednesday. A pound traded at $1.5015 late in New York, compared with $1.4968 a day earlier.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.6960 German marks, down from 1.7025; 1.4360 Swiss francs, down from 1.4380; 5.7760 French francs, down from 5.8005, and 1,659.00 Italian lire, down from 1,662.00.

HEADLINE: Castro's Daughter Pleads for Her Own

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ga., Dec. 23

 BODY:
Fidel Castro's estranged daughter, who defected to the United States on Tuesday after what she described as a cloak-and-dagger escape from Cuba, surfaced here today to tweak her father for his misrule and to plead with him to let his granddaughter join her in freedom.
Appearing haggard and tense at a news conference, Alina Fernandez Revuelta told how she had secretly obtained a Spanish passport, gained weight, donned a wig and applied layers of makeup so that her appearance would match that of the woman whose identity she had assumed. On Sunday, she said, her chance came and she seized it, boarding a flight to Madrid and then heading to the United States after her request for political asylum was quickly granted. 
 "You have to realize the desperation it takes to turn a person's core to iron to withstand the hardship of escape and the possibility you may have no hope of ever seeing your child again," she said, referring to the 16-year-old daughter she left behind. She urged her fellow Cubans to "have faith in God" and said she would do "everything possible to be deserving" of the refuge granted her by the United States.
 
Strained Relations
 Ms. Fernandez Revuelta's relations with her father have been strained for at least a decade. Mr. Castro has never publicly acknowledged that she is his daughter, though their relationship is widely known to the Havana elite. She made clear the extent of their estrangement when asked if she wished to send a message to her father, who next week will celebrate the 35th anniversary of his seizure of power.
"I've never spoken of Mr. Castro as my father," she responded, her tone a mix of irony and asperity. "Please."
Ms. Fernandez Revuelta, 37, was born out of wedlock to Natalia (Nati) Revuelta, a wealthy Havana socialite and early revolutionary sympathizer and protector of Mr. Castro. Ms. Revuelta was married to a prominent cardiologist, Orlando Fernandez, when the child was born. Ms. Fernandez Revuelta's mother continues to live in Havana, but Dr. Fernandez and other members of the family eventually left for the United States.
 
Repeated Efforts to Leave
 Since the mid-1980's, Ms. Fernandez Revuelta, a former model, repeatedly sought permission to leave Cuba to join her husband, a Mexican. But her requests for an exit visa were repeatedly turned down by Government officials aware of her identity and fearful of the diplomatic embarrassment that her departure and criticisms abroad of her father's rule might cause.
Earlier today, Ms. Fernandez Revuelta said, she spoke by telephone with her mother, grandmother and daughter and was told that no reprisals had yet been taken. "I'm worried about these three people, but nobody has come to the house" from state security, she said.
Ms. Fernandez Revuelta urged Mr. Castro to allow her only child, who is also named Alina, to leave Cuba. But she acknowledged that the Cuban government might be smarting from her defection and she said her daughter might have to be smuggled out. "I want the Cuban Government to respect the right of mother and daughter to live and grow together," she said. "This is an obvious case of human rights."
 
Hope for a Foundation
 Ms. Fernandez Revuelta would not say where she plans to live, but said she hoped to establish a foundation to deal with health issues relating to refugees and Cuba after Communism falls.
Ms. Fernandez Revuelta spoke to reporters in the penthouse quarters of Elena Amos, a Cuban-American whom Ms. Fernandez Revuelta described as "the soul" of the operation to spirit her from Cuba. Mrs. Amos, the widow of an insurance magnate whose company has its headquarters here, has helped other defectors and their relatives leave Cuba, most notably a former Cuban Air Force pilot, Orestes Lorenzo.
One year ago this week, Mr. Lorenzo, who had flown to the United States in a MIG jet fighter, returned to Cuba clandestinely in a small plane for his wife and children, who were waiting on a remote stretch of highway east of Havana. Mrs. Amos financed that daring rescue, which made her and Mr. Lorenzo heroes to Cuban exiles.
 
No Discussion of Accomplices
 Ms. Fernandez Revuelta declined to talk in any detail about who else had helped her leave Havana, saying their lives could be endangered. But she said it had been relatively easy to get past security and immigration officials at Havana's airport, describing how she had packed a suitcase as a tourist might and tried to act casually. There is "a lot of Spanish tourism" in Cuba, these days, she said, so it was easy to pass herself off as a visitor.
For the most part, Ms. Fernandez was reluctant to be drawn into discussing Cuban politics. When asked about the political and economic situation on the island and how it had influenced her decision to leave, she replied, "Draw your own conclusions."
In recent years, Ms. Fernandez Revuelta has given interviews in Havana to Spanish and American journalists in which she described Mr. Castro as "a tyrant" and the Communist regime he installed as "a dead-end street." In his book "Castro's Final Hour," Andres Oppenheimer quoted Ms. Fernandez Revuelta as saying she associated Mr. Castro's rule primarily "with economic collapse, with food shortages" and political and cultural repression.
"I don't have the slightest idea whether his days are numbered or not, because his days don't matter to me," she said today when asked if her father's dictatorship seemed to be nearing its end. "What is important to me are the days remaining until I can see my daughter."
 
A 10-Mile Bike Ride to School
 But Ms. Fernandez Revuelta later indicated that conditions in Cuba are so bad that even the governing elite is suffering privations. She said her daughter attended the National School of the Arts, considered the best in Cuba, but that the institution had not functioned normally for at least two years.
"The situation has degraded," she said. "She has to ride her bicycle 10 miles to school, through a dangerous route" because the bus system no longer works and fuel for private and state vehicles is scarce. And when the girl gets to school, "the teachers are absent because they have the same transport problems," she said.
Ms. Fernandez Revuelta mocked news reports in which Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina was quoted as saying that she, like all other Cubans, had the right to leave the country. "If I could leave like any ordinary Cuban, I would have left before at various junctures," she scoffed. "If I could leave like any ordinary Cuban, I would not be standing here today."

HEADLINE: In Big Cases, Lots of Briefs And 'Friends'

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Hard cases may or may not make bad law, but for the select circle of lawyers who practice regularly before the United States Supreme Court, big cases certainly make work.
A grant of review by the Court in a case with important economic or social implications typically sets off a frenzy of brief-writing, not only by the parties but also by many organizations seeking to appear as "friends of the Court." The opportunity to speak to the Justices on an issue that matters is one that few with a stake in the outcome care to pass up, particularly when the actual parties cannot be expected to address the distinct concerns of all who might be affected. 
 One big case in the current Supreme Court term is Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission, which is scheduled for argument on Jan. 12. At stake is the constitutional future of cable television -- or, if some of the more vigorously written briefs are to be believed, the future of all telecommunications. The case is a First Amendment challenge by the cable industry to the provisions of a 1992 law requiring cable systems to carry the signals of local broadcast stations.
 
126 Lawyers' Signatures
 If the Justices had any doubt that the stakes were high, they have only to glance through the 22 briefs that have been filed since the Court accepted the case on Sept. 28.
Actually, they have only to scan the covers of the briefs to see a virtual Who's Who of the Supreme Court bar. No less than 126 lawyers, representing 49 companies, organizations and governmental bodies, have signed the briefs that constitute the six-inch stack.
Thirteen lawyers signed a brief for Turner Broadcasting and nine other cable programmers. It was one of five main briefs filed by the cable industry in its challenge to the law. On the other side, five main briefs were filed by the Federal Government, the broadcast industry and others defending the law, which was upheld by a lower Federal court.
The total filings in this case come nowhere near the 78 "friend of the Court" briefs the Court received in a 1989 abortion case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. And neither is Turner Broadcasting anywhere near unique among the many Supreme Court cases that put an important issue in play and prompt the great American legal machine to respond.


GRAPHIC: Here are the briefs filed with the Supreme Court in Turner Broadcasting System v. Federal Communications Commission. An asterisk identifies each brief's counsel of record, the lead lawyer in the group. The appellants -- essentially, the cable industry -- are asking the Court to declare unconstitutional the 1992 law that requires cable systems to carry the signals of local broadcast stations. The appellees -- the Federal Government and the broadcasters -- are asking the Justices to affirm a lower court opinion that found the law constitutional.

HEADLINE: Pac-Man It's Not. The Future of a Presidency and U.S. Health Care, Maybe.

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
November 1995. National health care has been law for a year, and universal coverage is almost a fact. But costs are already running above projections, and Bob Dole is making wisecracks about voodoo Democrat economics. A value-added tax or Oregon-style rationing would solve the budget problem, but would be suicide to introduce before the elections . . .
A page from Hillary Rodham Clinton's future? Perhaps. But with a little help from Silicon Valley, the future is now, and open to anyone with access to a zippy I.B.M.-compatible personal computer. SimHealth, a $29.95 computer game produced by Maxis Business Simulations with a grant from the Markle Foundation, gives back-seat ambulance drivers the chance to design their own health care system from scratch and to observe the consequences, including the possibility of being voted out of office. 
 With its slick graphics and randomly introduced news bulletins, the game may prove as entertaining as Maxis's popular simulations of genetic mutation (SimLife), urban planning (SimCity) and insect colonies (SimAnt).
 
Budget Policy May Follow
 But this time, the idea is to sugarcoat a maximum-strength civics lesson. Lloyd Morrisett, the president of the Markle Foundation, hopes SimHealth will be the model for making complex public policy understandable to a generation that is used to absorbing the news in video bites. "If people think the game is fun and interesting, we will try it elsewhere," he said, "perhaps with budget policy, welfare reform or the environment."
The White House has already installed a preview version of SimHealth in a dozen of its computers. And Jeff Eller, a spokesman for the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform, thinks simulation games could serve policy professionals as well as amateurs by forcing those with different views to examine their assumptions. "You can't dismiss this as another Pac-Man or Tetris," he allows.
Computer simulation has been a standard industrial design technique for two decades, allowing engineers to test the stability of a new aircraft wing or the adequacy of a factory's quality-control system without investing a penny in the real thing. By the same token, scientists have used simulations to solve problems that resist straightforward mathematical solutions. Forecasts of global warming, for example, depend heavily on the technique.
Simulations that are both timely and worth the effort have generally had the drawback of requiring immense number-crunching power: Multimillion-dollar supercomputers are still the tools of choice for simulating the explosion of nuclear weapons and tracks of hurricanes.
 
Faster Personal Computers
 Indeed, John Hiles, the general manager of Maxis Business Simulations, notes that only in the last few years have personal computers become fast enough and cheap enough to serve as vehicles for mass-market simulation games.
But even the most realistic simulations of jet-fighter duels and sports leagues have obvious limitations, being no better than the fixed assumptions that drive them. In SimCity, Maxis's urban planning game, Mr. Hiles points out that the "the nuclear power plant always melts down."
The Markle Foundation, which is always hunting for ways to bridge the communications gap between complicated issues and a public that has neither the time nor the inclination to spend hours absorbing the often-dreary stuff of policy, had something very different in mind.
Since the whole point of SimHealth is to create a relatively painless way of exploring the practical problems of providing health care, players are always free to alter either the priorities of the plan or the assumptions about how the moving parts interact.
"I think SimHealth is an intriguing alternative," Mr. Eller, the Presidential panel's spokesman, said.
 
Playing the Game
 To start the game, a player must make explicit what he or she values most about health care reform. The two broad dimensions of choice, what SimHealth labels "liberty versus equality" and "community versus efficiency," are applied to a variety of core issues.
On cost control, for example, the player is asked whether competition should take precedence over regulation, whether individuals should take primary responsibility for preventive care and whether standardization of treatment protocols is an acceptable interference in the doctor-patient relationship.
From then on, the player is free to mix and match policies on the understanding that failure to sustain consistent priorities will cost political support and perhaps end the game with an election.
One might, for example, choose a Canadian-style single payer system with rationing of individual procedures, paying for it with an income tax and a 10 percent patient co-payment. Or one might opt for managed competition, underwritten by employer-paid insurance and buttressed by caps on the growth of hospital outlays.
Every policy sets off a stream of consequences for businesses, individuals, hospitals, doctors and government budgets. And a player can always monitor the effects; for example, asking what percentage of household income is going to health care, or how large the budget deficit is. Policy changes require the expenditure of "political chips" that translate into lost votes at election time.
Most ingenious, perhaps, every policy is linked to a set of relatively optimistic "default" assumptions and a "counter" set of pessimistic assumptions, designed with the help of a panel of health care experts assembled by the Markle Foundation. The game even permits players to custom-design the working parts.
 
A 'Neutral' Forum
 For example, the decision to increase by 10 percent the number of acute care procedures covered by insurance would ordinarily increase the demand for hospital beds by 2 percent. But under the pessimistic counter-assumptions, a 10 percent increase in coverage generates a 5 percent increase in hospital care demand. "It's about as neutral a forum as you can get," Mr. Eller said.
Alternatively, a player might experiment with a half-dozen different numbers to see how they would affect hospital crowding or Federal deficits -- or even the profitability of businesses in paying insurance premiums over a period of months or years.
That flexibility excites Dan Beauchamp, a former Deputy Commissioner of Health in New York State who now teaches public policy at the State University in Albany. "Even very smart policy makers have trouble thinking about several variables rocketing around at once," Mr. Beauchamp said.
Whether or how SimHealth will influence the national health debate is unclear. The Markle Foundation has distributed a preview version of the game to Congressional staff members and senior Administration officials. But the foundation's major concern at the moment is getting it into the hands of a wider range of opinion leaders, everyone from business executives to doctors to economics professors.
While he at first considered giving away the game, Mr. Morrisett decided that doing so would make it impossible to distribute it through commercial channels like software vendors, mail-order houses and college bookstores. Instead, the foundation will subsidize promotion and hold the retail price below $40. "No one is going to make money on SimHealth," Mr. Hiles predicted.
That, of course, is not the primary goal.

HEADLINE: A 1-in-55-Million Chance Brings an Early Christmas

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Percy Ray Pridgen, a retired bricklayer with 17 children and 29 grandchildren, trembled and burst into tears today when he was asked how he would spend $45 million he won in a lottery jackpot.
Mr. Pridgen, 69, will split a $90 million payoff from the Powerball lottery with Chuck Gill of Richmond, a 35-year-old former barber and government worker who is now unemployed. 
 Both men, who had the only winning tickets, will receive payments amounting to $6,000 a day for the next 20 years.
Mr. Pridgen said he planned to buy a country home for his wife. But beyond that, he said, "Somebody's going to have to tell me" how to spend the rest. He then buried his head in his hands and wept.
Mr. Gill, said he wanted to move to a place "with a lot of palm trees and a lot of umbrellas." But first, he said, he, his wife and their 4-year-old daughter, Tiana, would travel immediately to Paris.
"It's going to be an early Christmas," he said. "I'm going to try to give something back to my neighborhood, because my brothers out there."
Mr. Pridgen and Mr. Gill will receive their first checks in about 10 or 15 days, said Beverly Hunt, a spokeswoman for the D.C. Lottery. The owners of the Washington liquor stores that sold the grand prize tickets will each receive $25,000.
The Powerball game, played in 14 states and the District of Columbia, had not yielded a winning ticket in 16 previous drawings over the last eight weeks.
The winning numbers drawn on Wednesday were: 1, 3, 13, 15 and 29. The powerball was 12.
The odds of a ticket being the big winner were 1 in 55 million. Fifty-four ticket holders matched every number but the powerball and won $100,000 each,

HEADLINE: Stocks Close Mixed in Quiet Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Most stock market averages rose slightly yesterday in a quiet session ahead of the Christmas holiday. Only the Dow Jones industrial average edged lower, falling near the close after trading higher most of the day.
The market will be closed today. Analysts said the Dow's strong performance in early trading yesterday prompted selling in anticipation of the three-day break. 
 Prices were supported by continued low interest rates and solid gains earlier in overseas markets. Major stock indexes on the London, Paris and Frankfurt exchanges set new closing highs. And the Mexican Bolsa, lifted by continuing demand for Telefonos de Mexico stock, soared to its second consecutive record high.
The Dow industrials, however, lost 4.47 points, closing at 3,757.72. For the week, the Dow gained 6.15 points.
 
 
Intraday High for Dow
 At one point, the Dow surged through its Dec. 13 closing high of 3,764.43, posting an intraday high of 3,774.21.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange fell to 227.2 million shares, from 272.4 million on Wednesday. But gainers outnumbered losers, 1,257 to 835.
Eugene E. Peroni Jr., director of technical research for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, said that while no trends were apparent in the trading, he saw some strengths in the underlying market.
"We saw some pretty good positioning by investors as they set up for a year-end rally," he said.
"The market's behavior in the last few weeks has been toward building a base, or platform, that will carry it into February 1994."
Some analysts said support for stock prices was coming from the continued release of positive economic data and the absence of significant inflation. With more such reports issued by the Government yesterday, Treasury bond prices ended mostly higher and interest rates held steady.
 
 
Gains in Computers and Drugs
 Traders said renewed strength in computer and medical stocks helped pull the Nasdaq composite index higher to 758.70, up 2.63 points.
The Standard & Poor's composite rose 0.06 point, to 467.38, and the Big Board composite index rose 0.34 point, to 258.49.
The stock of Broderbund Software tumbled 6, to 34 1/2, losing 14.8 percent of its value, after reporting first-quarter earnings that were below analysts' estimates. While Broderbund's earnings rose 28 percent, the company's revenues were only marginally higher. In response, analysts did what they usually do when earnings disappoint them: they lowered their ratings on the company's stock.
Another software stock, Cisco Systems, rose 1 3/8, to 62 1/8, on the news that it would be added to the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks on Thursday, replacing Travelers, which plans to merge with Primerica. Shares of Travelers rose 1/4, to 31 7/8.
Shares of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, which rallied on Wednesday in anticipation of the board's approval of a union-led buyout, gave back some gains. The stock fell 1 7/8, to 146 5/8.
High-technology stocks rose, led by Intel, up 3/8, to 62 1/8; General Electric, up 3/4, to 106 1/8, and Motorola up 1 1/4, to 90 1/4.
Drug stocks gained. Johnson & Johnson rose 5/8, to 43 1/2, and Pfizer advanced 1/2, to 67 1/8. Pfizer said it had filed for Food and Drug Administration approval to market Tenidap for the treatment of arthritis.
Amdahl fell 5/8, to 6 1/8. The company said it expected a loss of more than 35 cents share for the third quarter. The company said that pricing pressures had hurt profits.
Georgia-Pacific dropped 1, to 68. The shares were down as much as 2 3/4 before Smith Barney Shearson raised its rating on the stock, saying that the weakness in price was a buying opportunity. The paper company said it expected a loss of between $30 million and $50 million for the fourth quarter because of weak pulp and paper prices and a $21 million charge for compensation programs.

HEADLINE: Lewis R. Koller, 98; Was Physicist for G.E.

 BODY:
Dr. Lewis R. Koller, a retired physicist who developed supersensitive photoelectric devices and equipment for the General Electric Company, died yesterday at the Josephine M. Lilly Care Center in Falmouth, Mass. He was 98 and lived in Falmouth and Cambridge, Mass.
Dr. Koller was a native of New York City. He graduated from Cornell University in 1917 and then earned a Ph.D. in physics there in 1921. After postgraduate studies in Cambridge, England, he joined General Electric's Edison Lamp Works in Harrison, N.J. 
 In 1925 he transferred to the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, N.Y., where he held the title of research associate until his retirement in 1960.
Among his early inventions were a giant, highly sensitive photoelectric cell that recorded the amount of daylight over any desired period; a photoelectric cell that acted as a traffic checker, registering passing automobiles for traffic planners 24 hours a day, and a germ-killing lamp.
After his retirement, he moved to Cambridge and worked as a research associate at the National Research Corporation.
Dr. Koller's wife of 59 years, Noreen Mathews Koller, died in 1985. He is survived by three daughters, Felicity K. Putnam of Falmouth, A. Noreen Koller of Cambridge and Sylvia K. Gerhard of Canton, Mass.; a sister, Hortense K. Becker of Highland Park, Ill.; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Some Details Emerge on United Deal

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Details emerged yesterday about the proposal by unions at United Airlines to gain control of the carrier, but industry analysts said they would have to wait several weeks before they had enough data to evaluate the offer.
For example, according to information provided by the company and the unions, the employee stock ownership plan that will hold 53 percent of the stock of United's parent, the UAL Corporation, if the deal is consummated, will result in new accounting methods for UAL. That change makes estimating future earnings difficult. 
 "It is such a complex transaction," said Tom Longman, an airline analyst at Bear, Stearns. "We're sitting here with nothing other than newspaper articles to guide us."
Other details that will likely sway investors' decisions include who will manage United along with Gerald Greenwald, a former vice chairman of Chrysler, who has been chosen by the unions to replace Stephen M. Wolf as chairman of United. Union leaders have not said how many current top managers they intend to replace.
Some of the uncertainty may have been reflected in investors' actions yesterday. UAL's stock lost $1.875 to close at $146.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Profitability Is Seen
 Still, the stock has gained back a few dollars since the highlights of the buyout proposal were first publicized in mid-December. Many industry analysts and institutional shareholders have criticized the deal as too low, and some have predicted that UAL's stock will trade around $200 a year from now.
Proponents of the offer say that union concessions will help make UAL more profitable in the long run. Those concessions include work rule changes that will enable United to create a separate lower-cost division to take over flights of less than 750 miles. The unions have committed to operate that division, with lower costs from decreased wages and increased productivity, for 12 years.
The agreement includes a no-strike clause as well as job protection provisions for a period of slightly less than six years, during which the unions will provide wage and work-rule concessions.
United's unions have said their members will vote on the transaction no later than Jan. 31. All the details of the offer will then be available to shareholders and their advisers by March 15.
The broad terms of the offer call for the unions to exchange roughly $5 billion in wage and work-rule concessions for 53 percent of the company. Current shareholders will receive $88 a share in cash, preferred stock and notes. The dividend on the preferred stock and the interest rate on the notes will be set several months from now.
Because of the varying size of their wage concessions, employees of each labor group will receive a different share of the 53 percent of the company represented in the employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP. The pilots' union will have 46 percent, machinists will own 37 percent and nonunion employees will own 17 percent.
The flight attendants' union left the buyout effort this fall after a dispute with United executives, but they have been invited by the other unions to rejoin the effort. They are expected to make that decision next month.

HEADLINE: Durables Orders Post Sharp Gain

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Fresh evidence of a rejuvenated economy appeared today, with factories posting the longest streak of gains in big-ticket orders since 1987 and consumers enhancing their ability to keep on spending.
New orders for durable goods, items ranging from radios to steamrollers that are expected to last three years or more, surged 2 percent in November, the Commerce Department reported. The advance, the fourth consecutive, showed that factories were clearly participating in the economy's pickup this fall. 
 The department also reported today that both personal incomes and personal spending grew at healthy rates in November and that incomes were a bit higher than previously thought for each of the preceding three months.
 
 
'A Reasonably Robust Pace'
 "The numbers we've seen today suggest the economy has the wherewithal to grow at a reasonably robust pace" into the new year, Daniel Laufenberg, economist at IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis, said. The savings rate, he added, has climbed back, somewhat surprisingly, to 4 percent.
In another report, the Labor Department found today that first-time claims for unemployment benefits edged up 4,000 last week, to 332,000, a negligible change. On a four-week average, claims continued to improve, to 332,750.
Mainly because of the rise in orders for durable goods, several analysts raised their sights for the economy's performance early next year. Growth, as measured by the gross domestic product, has been expected to slow sharply from a rate of 4 percent or more in the final quarter of this year.
One was Ben K. Han, the economist for the Corestates Financial Corporation in Philadelphia. Today's results "tend to support the thesis that the first quarter next year will be quite a bit stronger than some people expected," he said, raising his own January-March forecast to a 3 percent pace. He now expects that noticeable slowing will not occur until the second quarter, when he sees national output slipping to 2 percent as consumer spending tapers off and taxes rise.
Although about two-thirds of the rise in durable goods orders was accounted for by the volatile aircraft and motor vehicle industries, the gain was nonetheless widespread. Over all, there were jumps of 5.7 percent for transportation equipment, 4.5 percent for industrial machinery and equipment and 2.1 percent for primary metals, all exceeding or matching October's gains.
 
 
Decline in Electronics
 The only major sector to decline was electronic and other electrical equipment, down 7.6 percent, which roughly wiped out gains in September and October.
The gain in orders for durable goods would have been even higher, 2.2 percent, had it not been for the continuing erosion of military business. November's 1.7 percent decline, however, was far less than the 17.3 percent dive in October.
The last time there were as many as four consecutive monthly gains in durable orders was from February through July 1987.
One of the most widely followed subcategories, orders for capital goods other than aircraft and military equipment, posted another solid gain of 2.6 percent, up 24.9 percent from a year earlier. In comparison, durable goods orders as a whole rose 8.8 percent in the last 12 months.
 
 
Investing in Machinery
 Capital spending, running last month at a $139.4 billion annual rate, was a main factor in the economy's growth this year as cost-conscious manufacturers sought to substitute computers and other machinery for workers.
Shipments of durable goods also posted their fourth consecutive monthly gain, rising an impressive 2.7 percent. But unfilled orders slipped six-tenths of a percent, continuing a decline that has persisted for 28 of the last 33 months.
Although shrinking backlogs have traditionally been a caution signal for the economy, analysts now regard this trend mainly as evidence of the adoption of increasingly sophisticated techniques for managing inventories.
The Commere Department's other report released today found that personal incomes rose six-tenths of a percent last month, a fourth consecutive advance. The gain for October has now been put at seven-tenths of a percent.
Spending rose four-tenths of a percent in November, the eighth consecutive increase, as holiday shopping got under way.
 
 
Incomes Outpace Spending
 Incomes grew faster than spending in November, allowing consumers to rebuild savings at a time when installment debt and other figures suggested that they were spending beyond their means.
Savings rose to an annual rate of $200.4 billion in November after being basically unchanged in October and falling $8.4 billion, to $189.3 billion, in September.
Wages and salaries rose at a rate of $11.7 billion last month, the report showed, a gain about two-thirds as great as in October. Personal interest income continued to forge ahead, rising $2.5 billion, to $702.8 billion on an annualized basis.

Wilkens Tackles Wilkins

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
DOMINIQUE WILKINS was annoyed. That was obvious to Lenny Wilkens, and everyone else in Boston Garden, from the start.
He had been in a bad shooting slump. He had a sore ankle and began a game against the Celtics Wednesday night bothered by the flu and the fact that on Atlanta's opening possessions, he couldn't get his itchy fingers on the ball. 
 Mookie Blaylock was dribbling out near the key. Wilkins ran toward him with his hands out. Blaylock dribbled the other way and hoisted a jumper that missed. Wilkins turned, facing the Hawks' bench, and cursed. He didn't exactly sprint back on defense. Soon, without fuming or fuss, Lenny Wilkens called him to the bench.
The tranquil-looking coach knew it was going to be a stomach-churning night with the 33-year-old no-conscience scorer. Wilkins is in the last year of his $3.5 million contract. That will exacerbate any game-night situation when Wilkins isn't in the flow.
When Wilkins isn't in the game, the Hawks' ball movement is noticeably improved. But he is still their marquee player. Their chance to challenge in the East is linked to him. Thus the coach's dilemma in Boston was to figure out how to get Wilkins through the night, extract something positive from his game, without letting him drag the Hawks down.
For years, the Hawks have been Dominique's team. Their recent reputation has been a reflection of Dominique's, an exciting highlight film with no defensive core. When Wilkens's career alarm started ringing last spring in Cleveland, where he helped make a contender out of what was a horrendous team, people wondered why this scholarly basketball teacher would choose Atlanta and this seemingly incorrigible class.
The season began. The Hawks were suddenly playing defense, trapping, hustling, as they hadn't since Mike Fratello and a young Doc Rivers were on their side. Their ball-hawking guards, Blaylock and Stacey Augmon, were reminiscent of Dennis Johnson and Gus Williams from Wilkens's Seattle championship coaching days. The Hawks won a team-record 14 straight, 17 of 18. Before they left Boston, before they ran out of steam in the fourth quarter and lost to the Knicks, 84-75, last night at Madison Square Garden, the Celtics honcho Dave Gavitt bumped into Wilkens in the hall.
Gavitt told him, "Thirty-three years I've known you and it took me until this year to realize you're a genius."
Who would've told him? Who would've blown Wilkens's horn, or smoke? Sometime next year, this scholarly 56-year-old native of Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant will pass Red Auerbach's 938 career victories and become pro basketball's top-winning coach. He covets that record. His name in the book would be all the recognition he would need.
Had the Hawks landed their first choice, Rick Pitino, there would have been much glorious hype about Pitino's system, how his mere presence, like Pat Riley's in New York, would surely tame the Hawks. In London, after the Hawks put on an embarrassing exhibition display in October, Wilkens knew what everyone was saying about him. "Poor Lenny," he said.
His entire career, as coach and Hall of Fame player, has been spent in low-octane haunts like St. Louis, Portland, Seattle and Cleveland. He never sought attention. He demanded time for family, for reading, for mountain hikes. He didn't care to lecture the corporate lunch crowd. He was an economics major at Providence who originally hoped to teach. Basketball was never his whole life.
Americans prefer obsessive workers in sports. Coaches who watch film all night are somehow better. When Wilkens was the point guard for Bill Fitch, Captain Video, he was asked to sit through thousands of pick-and-roll screenings. "I'd fall asleep," he said.
When Wilkens became a player-coach 22 years ago in Portland, he said he actually screamed his head off. "No one heard me," he said.
Not much was getting through to Dominique in Boston the other night either. He shot 6 for 21. He briefly cost the Hawks a fourth-quarter lead with a handful of terrible shots. At that point, Wilkens called time. His voice about as loud as it gets, he said: "We take control of this game right here!" With total command of his huddle, he diagrammed a play for Kevin Willis on the low post. Willis hit a jump hook. The Hawks kept going back to Willis, again and again. He scored 32 points. The night was won.
Never the model of consistency, Willis shot 4 for 19 last night against the Knicks. Dominique's woeful shooting continued. The Hawks still played tough defense. They rallied from 15 points behind. Dominique may still have the ball, but this is no longer his team.

HEADLINE: A Rush to Judgment on City Taxes

 BODY:
With reckless disregard for the public, and with very little discussion, the New York City Council this week rammed through a tax abatement bill that may be good for developers but could well be bad for the city. Though the bill was introduced at Mayor David Dinkins's initiative, he should veto it, forcing the Council to give the measure the careful deliberation it requires.
The bill in question would broaden an existing real estate tax abatement program to cover a swath of midtown and lower Manhattan; the program now covers the rest of Manhattan and other parts of the city. It would freeze real estate taxes on residential buildings for 10 years at rates set before the building was constructed. The rates would rise gradually for another 10 years until they reach their normal level. 
 The property would have to be vacant or "underused" -- a small building, for instance -- and developers would have to reserve one in five apartments in the new structure for low-income families for the life of the abatement.
The idea is to encourage development, boost the city economy and build some low-income housing. Without a tax break, proponents say, developers in this economy will not build.
There are sites, even in midtown Manhattan, where incentives might make sense. But that argues for a carefully drafted bill with limited application, instead of a piece of global legislation that could have unintended, and detrimental, consequences. For example, the bill might give unnecessary breaks to developers who would have built anyway; it could also temporarily cost the city tax revenues as it confronts another huge budget gap.
The Council gave little thought to these and other possible consequences as it raced through its final, agenda-packed meeting of the year. Council members and the public had hardly any notice that the legislation was even coming. There was no environmental or economic analysis. The bill is so ambiguously written that Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger and a Council member, Ronnie Eldridge of Manhattan, both leading opponents, can't even determine what sites it would cover.
The Dinkins administration says the Mayor warned during his re-election campaign that he would seek this legislation. It also says that the Housing Preservation Department has been working on the bill for months. But the last-minute legislative rush job fuels suspicions that City Hall hurried the bill along to help one developer, William Zeckendorf, who is said to be planning a residential project at 56th Street and Broadway that would be covered by the bill.
Making a law, especially a law that could have wide economic impact, is a serious matter. The Council should be forced to go back to the drawing board. If Mr. Dinkins refuses to issue a veto, then it will be up to Council Speaker Peter Vallone to redraft legislation he never should have allowed to pass in the first place.

HEADLINE: Free Trade at the Movies Puts U.S. in New Role;
Since Adam Smith

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"How Free Trade Prompts Growth: A Primer" (front page, Dec. 15) asserts that the "nearly universal conviction that open trade drives global prosperity rests more on observation than on well-developed theory." Not so. 
 The economic theories supporting free trade have been well developed for centuries, beginning with Adam Smith more than 200 years ago. The idea is very simple: The more specialized the division of labor in the world, the more productive world economic activity becomes. If each human being had to provide for all of his or her necessities, there would not be enough hours in the day for each of us to build houses, make shoes, grow and gather food. So we specialize.
Those who put roofs on buildings, perform open-heart surgery or adjudicate disputes are efficient enough at their own specialties to be able to purchase the fruits of other specialized skills with money.
Free and open international trade merely extends this theory of labor specialization. If ready access to the world's best rubber trees makes Malaysia the most efficient producer of condoms (it does), it is more efficient for American computer manufacturers (something we are particularly good at) to buy their condoms from Malaysia and for Malaysians to get their computers here.
Everybody benefits from such specialization.

HEADLINE: Free Trade at the Movies Puts U.S. in New Role

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "High Noon at Uruguay Gulch" (Editorial Notebook, Dec. 13), Karl E. Meyer defends French foot-dragging on the demands in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade concerning United States access to Europe's audiovisual market and France's insistence on a cultural exception. The question has, at any rate, now been deferred (front page, Dec. 15). 
 Mr. Meyer is right that France is "not alone in fearing for the survival of its national culture." Even the United States does not leave culture entirely to markets. At year end, the rich remember tax writeoffs for gifts to museums. The real question is: How do we best protect national culture? The answer appears to be: Subsidize your movies, but permit free access (without quotas) to ours.
But the French-American dispute has other ironies that only economists will recognize. Jack Valenti, head of the motion picture association, and Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, have claimed that, since 57 percent of the movies shown in French theaters are American, the 11 percent surcharge levied on all movies (and spent on subsidizing French film production) must be shared with Hollywood.
I suggest that this remarkable new principle of taxation be adopted symmetrically by the United States. Our toll receipts (often earmarked for our highway spending) should be shared with Japan pro rata to the number of Japanese cars that pay road and bridge tolls in this country.
For those who have tracked and fought the Clinton Administration's shift to a tough, managed-trade, "results-oriented" trade policy toward Japan, based mainly on industry complaints that our shares in Japan's markets are low while Japan's shares in our markets are high, the irony is that the French are accusing us in the same way on movies.
Since Hollywood takes 80 percent of the European market, while European films take only 2 percent of ours, France accuses us of invisible protectionism, of structural impediments, much like those of which our industries accuse Japan!
Perhaps this role reversal might help to restore sanity to a Japan-fixated Administration that has allowed itself to become a handmaiden of Japan-bashers and special interests.

HEADLINE: Free Trade at the Movies Puts U.S. in New Role;
The Mexican Case

 BODY:
To the Editor:
William Safire, in "Hold That GATT" (column, Dec. 9) opposes France's attempts to limit Hollywood penetration of its market, stating, "the French public prefers the American product." This is questionable. 
 From my research on the interaction of Hollywood and United States foreign policy with the Mexican film industry since the 1930's, I conclude that moderate protection is necessary for other countries to preserve national culture. This goes beyond greater demand for Hollywood films.
The problem is competing economically with Hollywood. Demand for domestic movies in other countries is high, but it is impossible to fulfill when confronted with Hollywood's international economies of scale (in large part derived from its enormous domestic market), as well as the economic and diplomatic power of the United States.
It is true that there is great foreign demand for United States movies, and moderate protection and subsidization cannot erase it. What it can do is create the necessary space for other national film industries to exist -- allowing for cultural sovereignty in other countries and a more diverse world culture system.
Today Mexico issued postage stamps honoring several stars of its golden age of cinema (from the mid-1930's to the late 40's), including Maria Felix and Jorge Infante -- to go along with a recent one commemorating Cantinflas. The demand for films by such stars extended beyond Mexico to all of Latin America in the 40's. And the films of the era remain popular throughout the region.
It was the inability of Mexico -- weaker and more dependent on the United States than France is -- to protect its film industry after World War II from the coercive policies of Washington and Hollywood that has left Mexico with nostalgic stamps but a crippled movie industry.
For other countries, faced with Hollywood's insistence on free trade at all costs in an industry where Hollywood has all the advantages, regulating movies is in the national interest as a matter of cultural sovereignty.
Further, as South American states jump on the North American Free Trade Agreement bandwagon, Latin Americans should perhaps look to France, and to Mexican history, in demanding that their governments negotiate trade deals that defend cultural sovereignty.

HEADLINE: In Battling for Biotech, Monsanto Is the Leader

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
As the range of products produced by biotechnology grows, so do the stakes in the battle to convince consumers that there are greater benefits than risks in tampering with nature. For the next few months, at least, the Monsanto Company is destined to lead the battle.
Monsanto, the diversified chemical company that makes Ortho lawn and garden products and Nutrasweet, finds itself at the biotech front line because it won the race against companies like Eli Lilly, Upjohn and American Cyanamid to alter bacteria genetically into mini-factories producing a cow hormone called bovine somatotropin, or BST, that stimulates milk production. Monsanto received Food and Drug Administration clearance for its Posilac brand of BST last month and can begin selling it to American farmers on Feb. 3. 
 Based on a leafy campus outside this city, Monsanto has financed its drive into biotechnology with a bulging portfolio of existing products. Monsanto's current jewel is Roundup herbicide, a 19-year-old product that industry analysts say generates more than $1.4 billion annually in revenues.
Roundup still has strong growth potential because it is environmentally safer than its major competitors and an aid to the spreading practice of "no till" agriculture in which farmers reduce soil erosion by killing weeds with chemicals.
In addition to other herbicides and its Ortho line of products, Monsanto also makes high-quality polyesters, specialty plastics used widely in the automotive, appliance and medical products industries, Nutrasweet sweeteners, and, through its G. D.Searle subsidiary, a range of drugs. It earned $436 million on sales of $6.02 billion in the first nine months of this year.
Analysts said they believed the eventual worldwide demand for BST products could be $1 billion a year. But prying the new market open will be tough because biotechnology opponents are intent on stopping it.
"BST's the flagship product of agricultural biotechnology, but it has no socially redeeming value," said Andrew Kimbrell, staff counsel for the Foundation on Economic Trends, a Washington-based group that has opposed most biotechnology commercialization efforts. He said that his group planned to file lawsuits in January aimed at blocking Monsanto from beginning sales of Posilac.
Unlike most other products of gene-splicing that have reached the market, BST is not a medicine intended to improve human or animal health. Nor is it a substitute for an established product that would otherwise be extracted from animals at a much higher cost and risk of impurity, like the renin used in cheese making. The F.D.A. in 1990 approved an application by Pfizer Inc. to make that enzyme in genetically altered bacteria instead of recovering it from the stomachs of calves.
What BST injections can do is increase the output from the average herd by about 10 percent. Output for individual cows could rise as much as 20 percent. That should benefit the most efficient farmers, but in a segment of farming already swamped by surpluses, many agricultural experts believe it will hasten the long-term decline in the number of dairy farms. And no one expects consumers to see any lower dairy product prices.
 
$1 Billion Investment
 Monsanto's moment in the biotech spotlight is hardly a surprise. It has been one of the heaviest investors in the field, having spent more than $1 billion on BST since 1982 and hundreds of millions more on other biotech research, including drug-related research at Searle. Close behind BST in Monsanto's pipeline are a pork hormone that could produce leaner pigs and a variety of genetically altered plants with improved herbicide tolerance and insect resistance.
Still, the outcome of the BST battle may have more impact on the stock prices of small biotech companies than on Monsanto's shares. Even a smashing success for BST would not gain Monsanto as much attention from investors as a healthy upswing in worldwide demand for its core chemical businesses. At the moment, many analysts are focused on gauging the strength of the rebound in profits at troubled Searle, which has four new drugs in the market, including the hot-selling sleep aid, Ambien, and Daypro, a treatment for arthritis.
Analysts are also watching Nutra sweet more closely than BST. Nutra sweet has had no significant return yet on its efforts to develop fat substitutes and its biggest product, aspartame, came off patent a year ago. While the subsidiary has actually increased net income this year through rigorous cost cutting and expanding markets, analysts do not see a major upside potential.
 
'BST Is a Wild Card'
 "BST is a wild card in their earnings," said Robert S. Reitzes, who follows the company for C. J.Lawrence. Most analysts conservatively assume it will be a bust, he said.
It would not be the company's first high-profile flop. A light heavyweight in the chemical business behind giants like Dow and Du Pont for much of its existence, Monsanto has spent years methodically renovating and reshaping itself in search of better profit margins and faster-growing, less cyclical businesses. It developed Astro-Turf, the artificial grass carpet, for indoor arenas like the Houston Astrodome but failed to make much money on it.
The most recent major disappointment has been Searle, which Monsanto acquired in 1985. Searle's poorly managed drug pipeline left it saddled with about $100 million in costs for introducing new drugs at the same time it was trying to deal with the end of patent protection for Calan, the hypertension treatment that was its best seller. Company officials now agree that Searle cannot keep up with bigger competitors on its own, particularly at a time that the industry's profit margins are under pressure, but two years of seeking a suitable alliance have failed.
 
Simple Pleasures' Simple Flop
 The company has also suffered through Nutrasweet's efforts to develop markets for its Simplesse fat substitute, including an ill-fated venture to make Simple Pleasures ice cream that was quietly killed early this year.
"Every time we have tried to be in the distribution business, we have had our lunch, breakfast, dinner and midnight snack handed to us," said Robert Flynn, the blunt Canadian dispatched from headquarters in 1990 to overhaul Nutrasweet, which is based outside Chicago.
But Monsanto clearly has a respectable overall batting average. In its nine years under Richard J. Mahoney, its detail-oriented chairman and chief executive, management has kept its eye fixed on a goal of remaking itself into an enterprise capable of achieving a steady 20 percent return on equity and 10 percent annual growth in sales by the mid-1990's. Although it is still well short of its goal, Wall Street seems confident it is on the right track. More than half the 22 analysts who follow it rate the company a buy and no one recommends selling shares, according to Zacks Investment Research.
"I think the world is beginning to believe we are going to do it," said Mr. Mahoney, who calculates that the company has more than 60 percent of its assets deployed in businesses that meet the target, up from less than 25 percent in the early 1980's.
 
Shed Astro-Turf
 Monsanto in the last decade has purchased businesses with more than $3 billion in sales and shed others that generated $4 billion annually. Among those dropped are the Astro-Turf operations, oil and gas production, industrial control equipment, animal feed operations and Searle's consumer product businesses including products like Dramamine and Metamucil and Pearle Vision Centers.
During that same period, Monsanto has slashed costs and improved quality at many of its manufacturing operations, in part by becoming a leader in the use of industrial work teams that empower employees to make more operating decisions.
"Your opportunities to get prices up are very limited," said Robert G. Potter, president of Monsanto's chemical group, when asked about near-term prospects. "You really only have one tool at your disposal: control of your own costs."
In the long run, though, Monsanto cannot meet its financial targets without plenty of successful new products both inside and outside the biotech field, Mr. Mahoney said. That gives it all the incentive it needs to go all out to win the BST battle.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 5, 1994, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Dec. 24, about the Monsanto Company's biotechnology business, misidentified the company's main fiber product. It is nylon, not polyester. The article also misstated the company's goal for growth, and its spending on biotechnology. Monsanto is seeking a 10 percent annual increase in earnings, not sales. It has spent more than $1 billion on biotechnology in general, not just on a cow hormone known as bovine somatotropin, or BST.

HEADLINE: Medical Costs Slower to Rise In New York

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Changes in the way doctors and hospitals are paid -- how much and by whom -- have begun to curb the steady rise of health care costs in the New York region. Costs are still going up faster than overall inflation, but the annual rate of increase is the lowest in 21 years.
Economists said this trend was especially noteworthy in view of the New York region's long-standing identification with high-cost health care. In fact, in recent months, medical-care inflation in the rest of the country has outpaced increases here. 
 Health care prices in the region rose 4.1 percent in the 12 months ending Nov. 30, down sharply from 6.3 percent a year ago and 10.9 percent in 1990, the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics said. It was the smallest 12-month increase since 1972.
"We have led the inflation parade," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the bureau's New York Commissioner. "This is a rarity, whether you are talking about medical care or anything else in this region."
What is particularly important is that the gap is narrowing between the medical portion of inflation and the rest of the price index. Health care prices across the country are still rising at 5.5 percent, almost double the 2.7 general inflation rate. But the increase nationwide had been as much as 9 percent three years ago.
Health care experts said the moderating trend was propelled by growing competition among doctors, hospitals and medical insurers, as well as a rise in public acceptance of managed health care programs that offer incentives to restrain costs.
They said the long-running economic slowdown and persistent unemployment also played a role by placing a damper on increases in wages, which are a big item in hospital budgets.
Changes in the system have accelerated as hospitals, physicians and insurers scramble to anticipate or deflect President Clinton's health care proposals. The President's effort is intended in part to help the country regain control of health care costs, something that may be beginning to happen even before any national plan is enacted.
The changes show up in a variety of ways.
 
Changing Coverage
 Many employers in the region, including General Electric, Martin Marietta, Allied-Signal and a growing number of retail stores and law firms, have been aggressively moving their people out of traditional coverage that pays separately for each service, with little or no supervision.
And both New Jersey and New York have loosened hospital rate regulations, freeing hospitals to compete for business as never before.
A brochure from New York University Medical Center itemizes the center's state-approved rates for selected procedures and higher charges at five other large Manhattan hospitals. It says, for example, that its price for gall bladder surgery is $5,810.24 while prices elsewhere range from $6,527.43 to $8,251.73.
Health maintenance organizations, such as U.S. Healthcare, provide incentives for obstetricians, for example, to follow professional rules that foster natural childbirth instead of expensive Caesarean section deliveries.
Egged on by cost-conscious employers, some patients are asking doctors to disclose the charges before agreeing to a test or procedure. And managed care companies often telephone to press doctors for reduced fees.
"The New York hospital market is seeing the dawning of competition," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.
 
Doctors Taking Action
 "It's been a revolution in the past year or so," added Joseph E. Davis, president of the 3,600-member New York County Medical Society. Exemplifying the changing medical culture, Dr. Davis, a urologist, has signed on with 10 managed care networks -- a step that thousands of doctors in New York and New Jersey are taking after decades of resistance.
He said physicians at several New York hospitals, including Cabrini Medical Center, where he practices, New York University Medical Center, and Lenox Hill, are also organizing their own networks to bid directly for group business, bypassing the H.M.O.'s and insurance companies.
"Physicians are anticipating change and really beginning to change their practices," said Kenneth J. Reifert, a vice president for corporate benefits planning at Merrill Lynch & Company. "They are more willing to negotiate than in the past."
Helping to drive costs down, a growing number of H.M.O.'s, including U.S. Healthcare, Cigna, Sanus and Prudential, are paying family doctors, pediatricians and internists a pre-set monthly amount for each health plan member, replacing the traditional fee for each visit, test or procedure. As a result, these primary care physicians are careful to avoid unnecessary services.
Hospitals also receive a fee for each illness, or a flat rate per day from many managed care plans, instead of reimbursing item by item for lengthy bills.
Cigna, which says it has H.M.O. contracts with 200,000 people in the tri-state area, pays $600 to $1,000 a day for medical and surgical patients, according to Tracy Bahl, executive director for Cigna in New York, a deep discount from the rate people on their own are charged.
Besides the new hospital-based physician groups, a number of hospitals are following the example of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, which has forged a network of hospitals to bid for the business of insurers and self-insured employers.
 
Labor Costs Are a Factor
 The sluggishness in the regional economy is holding down labor costs in hospitals, economists said. And as business declines under managed care, some hospitals are combining departments and reducing staffs.
Mr. Raske said 1,000 hospital jobs were eliminated in New York this year. New York University Medical Center, for example, has cut 325 jobs overall, even while it added 150 employees at a new women's center and a research institute.
Adding yet another possible explanation for the changes, some economists believe the insurance business may be at a low point in a cost cycle as insurers lower prices to attract new customers. If they discover they are losing money, their prices might soar in the next year or two, the economists said.
But some experts doubt that this pattern will hold. "Is this just another cycle, or a fundamental shift?" asked Bob Braddick, a principal with the Foster Higgins consulting firm. The answer may not be clear until next year at the earliest.
Although New York still lags far behind such hotbeds of managed care as California and Minnesota, health maintenance organizations here have recruited about 15 percent of the region's 19 million people, compared with only 11 percent in 1989.
Advertising heavily to increase their share of the market, U.S. Healthcare, Prudential, and Empire Blue Cross, among others, expect to raise monthly charges for H.M.O. members by 5 percent or less next year, compared with projected statewide increases averaging 5.7 percent in New York and 5.6 percent nationally.
With spending moderating for hospitals and physicians, insurance company requests for rate increases are getting a skeptical reception from state regulators.
 
Rate Increase Is Denied
 Noting that profits of U.S. Healthcare, the largest investor-owned H.M.O. in the region, were "significantly higher" than projected, the New York Insurance Commissioner, Salvatore Curiale, denied the company's request for a 6.2 percent average rate increase for next year.
Instead, he ordered U.S. Healthcare to cut premiums by 14.6 percent for individuals and 4.9 percent for employers with more than 50 workers. He approved a 1.6 percent increase for groups with 3 to 50 workers.
U.S. Healthcare, which has 350,000 members in 11 downstate New York counties, has appealed the ruling in New York Supreme Court.
New Jersey recently approved a 2 percent increase for U.S. Healthcare for the 12 months ending next June 30.
Trying to stay competitive, Healthnet, a H.M.O. owned by Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, is not seeking a 1994 rate increase in New York, Ramesh Punwani, Empire's chief financial officer said.
The nonprofit Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the state's largest health insurer, also canceled a previously approved general increase for non-H.M.O. members scheduled for next month.

HEADLINE: U.N. Leader Has Talks With North Korea

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PANMUNJOM, Korea, Dec. 24

 BODY:
The United Nations Secretary General crossed the border between South and North Korea today for talks with North Korean leaders on their suspected development of nuclear weapons.
The trip coincided with reports that North Korean and United States officials have made considerable progress in talks to allow international inspections of the North's nuclear plants. 
 Before traveling to the border from Seoul, the Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said, "I believe a crisis exists that requires the attention of the international community."
He was met by Col. Kim Ryun Ki, secretary of North Korea's delegation to the Korean Armistice Commission, a watchdog of the 1953 cease-fire that ended the three-year Korean War.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali later met for two hours with Kim Young Nam, Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, to offer the United Nations' help in defusing the situation, a U.N. official traveling with the secretary-general said. Mr. Kim told Mr. Boutros-Ghali that North was consulting directly with the United States and that no mediation was needed, the official said.
North Korea has refused to discuss inspections with anyone other than United States, apparently because it wants better relations with Washington as well as help with its economy.

HEADLINE: Indian Tribes Close Ranks to Protect Casinos From Cheats and Rivals

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE

 BODY:
The con artist was tracked by the Indians across a half dozen reservations, their ceiling TV cameras zooming in on her hands as she played at blackjack tables and coolly cheated tribal casinos out of $3,000 a sitting.
"In the old days, the tribes never got together on anything this way," said Roger Miller, a Mohican who is security director for the Potawatomi tribe's bingo and casino hall here and the founder of Wisconsin's new Indian Gaming Intelligence Association, which covers 11 tribes and 17 casinos. "It was divide and conquer. But with gaming, we're experiencing the same growing pains and lack of expertise, and so we help each other out now." 
 These are, indeed, new days of casino fortune for American Indians, and the tribal TV tapes finally exposed the blackjack player's scheme. It was a closed-TV system spying from her purse through a tiny, unobtrusive lens. It was tied into a van parked out in the casino lot in which her conspirators counted the cards being dealt out and instantly radioed back discreet betting instructions. The con artist was arrested, and a security bulletin was dispatched to all the tribes.
"It sounds crazy to go to all that trouble, but there's an awful lot of money out here now," Mr. Miller said, summarizing the attraction and risk in the booming new world of Indian casino gambling that is prompting a parallel revolution in tribal cooperation and safeguards.
 
Competitors Are Watching
 As Donald J. Trump and other envious competitors predict that the tribes will encounter corruption because of their inexperience, the leadership of Indian gaming is taking a variety of steps to defend the tribes' economic windfall. With 170 casinos opening in the past five years, by a Federal count, and many more being planned, tribes are building safeguards against both corrupt management and the ever ingenious assaults of the same predators who work the tables and slot machines in Nevada and Atlantic City.
A range of wariness can be found in the reservation casinos, from the latest electronic sophistication to the sort of fledgling naivete in management that marks any business rush. But the huge success of Indian casinos like Foxwoods in Ledyard, Conn., a veritable revenue machine that has become the most lucrative gambling hall in the nation in less than two years, is the reigning inspiration for the tribes.
There, Richard (Skip) Hayward, the Mashantucket Pequot chief regarded now as a casino genius, took care to hire as his chief executive and integrity expert G. Michael Brown, the former director of New Jersey's Division of Gaming Enforcement. Mr. Brown, a former prosecutor who built a reputation in forcing Atlantic City casinos to cut their underworld ties, has eased back from the absolute sovereignty so dear to other tribes and instead invited full on-site cooperation with state and Federal law-enforcement experts in gambling.
In setting an example for other tribes, Foxwoods, like most other big casinos, does not hesitate to arrest a gambler or employee openly, on the casino floor, once documented evidence is in hand. The showy arrest is valued as an assurance to the public and a warning to the staff that tribal standards are tight. More important, Mr. Brown, who also exchanges the latest gaming intelligence with Las Vegas and Atlantic City operators, says he urges other tribes to duplicate a key Connecticut requirement in the tribal gaming compact for thorough criminal and professional background checks of each employee and sizable outside contractor.
"The tribes have the same concerns and worries as other legitimate casinos: high-level security, strict internal controls of the movement of money and experienced management," said Mr. Brown, who also runs a Foxwoods consulting service for tribes starting up in the casino business.
"We've found a predictable mix," he said of two recent studies of other Indian casinos. "One was excellently run, the other was so lax in controls that it could easily fall victim to illicit dealings."
Mr. Brown estimated that the main threat to Indian gaming was not underworld infiltration as much as "bad business deals in a risky area, just as with junk bonds."
The Wisconsin tribal association has now extended its information exchange to a similar group of a dozen Indian casinos in Minnesota. It is an interstate model for a larger nationwide pooling of reservation intelligence that is being planned by the National Indian Gaming Association, the tribes' main industry and lobbying group.
The better casinos' emphasis on integrity is clear in a visit down to the security room at the Mystic Lake casino, an impressive gambling palace blending Las Vegas and wigwam themes that is run by the Minnesota Shakopee Sioux outside Minneapolis. A wall of television screens faces a control desk of 24-hour monitors who operate a custom-designed "eye in the sky" system of surveillance that can zoom in on fingertip-tight close-ups from three angles of each employee and produce instant snapshots of any suspicious characters on the floor. It was designed by Atlantic City experts hired by tribal leaders wanting industry savvy over simple blood ties.
Beyond warning about corrupt employees and players and threats from the underworld, the Wisconsin tribal network has been comparing overhead costs and urging tribes to maintain their own slot machines at a tenth of the cost of some outside experts. A recent Bureau of Indian Affairs report emphasized inflated management contracts as a greater threat to tribal profits than elaborate mob infiltration.
 
Value of Clean Games
 The Wisconsin Attorney General, James E. Doyle, who has a new gaming branch in the state's Criminal Investigation Division that works with the tribes, believes that action is needed on the Federal level to create and share a national repository of gambling intelligence and to help train enforcement agents. "The tribes recognize their long-range well-being rests on having clean games," Mr. Doyle said.
While Wisconsin's approach is a considered a model for tribes and states, Mr. Doyle, an expert on Indian gaming for the National Association of Attorneys General, warns that state laws present a crazy quilt in which oversight, accounting procedures and other necessities are often vague. In the rush to open tribal casinos, state authorities are understaffed and the risk is that background checks will be skimpy, Mr. Doyle stresses. "We're not having big problems with organized crime, but there are always the illegal dealers and player rip-offs that go with the territory," he said.
Federal law is rooted in Indian sovereignty and defers to state-tribal compacts for regulatory procedures. But Washington does require professional accounting standards and allows tribes to pay outside managers no more than 30 percent of overall profits. Exceptions up to 40 percent were widely allowed as tribes dealt with outsiders for start-up capital, but the National Indian Gaming Commission, the new Federal oversight agency, intends to reign that back in to guard against sweetheart deals that might siphon tribal revenues, said Tony Hope, the executive director.
"There are weaknesses in some of the compacts," Mr. Hope said, "'but the tribes are doing remarkably well. Because they are extended families, they are the ones who have taken action first in the three instances I know of in which figures from organized crime have attempted infiltration and been thrown out."
More pesky are the endless attempts at theft by fast-fingered employees and the array of new cheating devices from players. These include using a slot machine coin with a tiny tether so it is never actually deposited, using doctored credit cards to fool the banking cash machines now all over casinos and wearing minute electronic blackjack computers, taped onto an ankle, perhaps, to receive impulses signaled from a spying conspirator.
Justice Department reports have thus far discounted charges of significant underworld influence on reservations. But the money is ever inviting, and Mr. Hope is worried about the rapid casino proliferation and the shortage of Federal manpower, particularly to check that the compacts provide for first-rate accounting that he feels is the key to alerting the tribes to money skimming and other abuses, whether within the tribe or without. Here at the Potawatomi casino, each slot machine is connected to a central computer for instant accounting to tribal leaders down to each nickel bet.
 
Supreme Court Help
 The key to the tribal casino boom has been the Supreme Court's modern decisions bolstering the sovereignty and business prerogatives of Indians. Pressure is growing in Congress to curtail this billion-dollar tribal power, and while the Indians now have more lobbying withal of their own, they are aware that any serious reservation scandal would be seized upon as typical by critics like Mr. Trump. He angers some tribal leaders and amuses others with his complaint, as a casino manager threatened by Indian competition, that more and more tribes are coming forward led by gambling proponents who "don't look like Indians to me."
Mr. Miller takes this not as implicit racism but as a measure that Indians look more and more like established entrepreneurs who are mastering the gaming industry with growing sophistication. "The really incredible story in all this is how it's finally bringing the tribes together," said the Mohican guarding the Potawatomis' gambling coffers.

HEADLINE: 2 Japanese Companies Set Merger

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Two of Japan's leading chemical manufacturers said today that they would merge, creating one of the 10 largest chemical companies in the world and speeding the restructuring of one of this nation's least competitive industries.
Mitsubishi Kasei, one of Japan's largest general chemical manufacturers, will combine with Mitsubishi Petrochemical, the country's biggest petrochemical company, in a stock transaction. The new entity, tentatively called the Mitsubishi Chemical Company, would have consolidated sales of more than $14 billion. 
 Under the terms of the agreement announced today, each share of Mitsubishi Petrochemical stock would be exchanged for 1.3 shares of Kasei stock. Kasei would issue 641.3 million new shares in a transaction valued at about $2.5 billion.
 
A Need to Cut Costs
 Executives said the move had been driven partly by the need to cut costs because a severe economic slump was causing both companies to lose money in this fiscal year. But a bigger motivation, they said, was to become bigger and more competitive in the next century.
"We have to compete with the big global companies," Masahiko Furukawa, the president of Mitsubishi Kasei, said at a news conference.
Unlike automobiles, electronics and steel, Japan's chemical industry has barely been a player on the world stage. Not only does it lag well behind the world leaders in the United States and Europe, it also faces stiff competition from South Korea and Taiwan, which have lower costs and have been expanding their capacity.
Part of Japan's problem is that the country lacks petroleum and energy resources needed for the industry. But another factor is that Japan's industry is fragmented into small companies that lack economies of scale.
 
12 Companies Split a Market
 In Japan, for instance, 12 companies split an ethylene market of six million metric tons a year, while in the West, a million tons is regarded as the minimum sales needed for a company's survival, according to Nicholas D. Smith, an analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo.
When the two 1970's oil crises shook out the petrochemical industries in the West, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry organized Japan's industry into cartels and spread production cuts around, rather than letting smaller or less efficient companies fail.
"Allowing natural selection to keep industries in shape was unfortunately not regarded as the Japanese way," Mr. Smith wrote in a recent report.
Now, he said, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is encouraging joint ventures and alliances and there have been rumors of other mergers.
Mitsubishi Kasei ranked 13th on Fortune magazine's list of the world's largest chemical companies in 1992, with revenues of $9.55 billion. The merged company would rank ninth on that list with sales of $13.7 billion, still well behind the industry leader, Du Pont, at $37.4 billion.
The merger partners are both part of the Mitsubishi Group, a family of companies, known as a keiretsu, in which members often hold small stakes in one another.
 
Helped by Shell
 Mitsubishi Kasei and other companies in the Mitsubishi Group formed Mitsubishi Petrochemical in 1956 with help from Shell. Mitsubishi Kasei owns 4.7 percent of the petrochemical company, while various Shell affiliates own a combined 22 percent.
Kasei shares closed today at 433 yen, about $3.90, down 10 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while shares of the petrochemical company finished at 611 yen, about $5.50, down 19 yen. Trading in the two stocks was suspended when the news broke.
Akira Miura, the president of the petrochemical company, is to become the president of the new company while Mr. Furukawa, the president of Kasei, is to become chairman. The merger is expected to be completed in October.
How quickly its benefits will be realized is open to question. Since Mitsubishi Kasei has its own petrochemical division, there is some overlap. In fact, the two have petrochemical plants next door to each other in central Japan.
 
No Plans for Layoffs
 But a spokesman for Mitsubishi Kasei said the companies had no plans for layoffs or plant closings after the merger, although the two adjacent plants will be combined for greater efficiency. He said the companies did not expect the merger to raise antitrust problems.
Mitsubishi Kasei also makes carbon products such as coke, electronic materials such as for data storage disks, and pharmaceuticals. In the fiscal year that ended last March, it reported consolidated sales of 1.18 trillion yen, equivalent to $10.6 billion at today's exchange rate. Net profit was 6 billion yen, or about $54 million.
Mitsubishi Petrochemical had consolidated sales of 508 billion yen, about $4.6 billion, in the year ended in March. Net profits were 6.7 billion yen, about $60 million.

HEADLINE: Stocks Reach Record Levels In London and Paris Trading

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Prices on the London Stock Exchange closed at a record high for the second consecutive day today, prompted by continued hopes of lower interest rates and higher corporate earnings.
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 15.8 points, or almost a half percent, to 3,412.3. It was the first time that the index had closed above 3,400. 
 The London markets closed early for the Christmas holiday, but in Paris, where trading continued for a full session, the bourse ended at its second successive record close. The Paris CAC-40 share index gained 8.46 points, to 2,251.48; it gained 55.04 points for the week.
Many other exchanges in Europe had limited trading, while all stock, bond and commodity markets in the United States and Germany were closed.
The American markets and most in Europe will resume trading on Monday, but London will remain closed until Wednesday.
 
Positive Sentiment
 London traders said that while trading was slow today in the shortened session, the market sentiment was positive and they expected the rally to continue next week and into the new year.
In Tokyo, stocks closed lower in thin trading today as investors worried about the Government's slow response to calls for substantial steps to lift the economy, brokers said.
Investors said they feared that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa would not announce any concrete steps at a news conference later in the day.
The Nikkei average lost 304.63 points, or 1.75 percent, closing at 17,141.11. The Tokyo markets were closed on Thursday for a national holiday.
At the news conference, Prime Minister Hosokawa outlined a six-point economic proposal that did not include new Government spending or tax cuts to stimulate the economy. He also apologized for not having achieved political reform by his self-imposed deadline of the end of the year.
The market has been held back by the Government's procrastination on economic stimulus. "Ministers are holding repeated meetings, but it is still unclear what they are going to do for the economy," Kenichi Nagasu, a trader for Cosmo Securities, said.
In Hong Kong, prices closed sharply higher before the Christmas break, with the main index breaking through the 11,000 level for the first time. Brokers said the rise was fueled by continued demand from overseas for blue-chip property counters.
The Hang Seng Index ended the half-day session up 158.64 points, or 1.46 percent, at a record 11,039.84. Trading ended at midday for the Christmas holiday. Light profit taking brought the index off an intraday high of 11,044.65.
The Australian market ended 20 points higher in a reasonably busy half-day of trading before the four-day Christmas break, brokers said.
At the close, the all ordinaries index was up 20.4 points, or about 1 percent, to 2,089.2, its high for the day.
In Mexico, stocks gained for the third consecutive day as investors bought shares in hopes that companies' earnings would rise in 1994, analysts said.
The Bolsa index, which has gained 45.9 percent so far this year, gained 5.23 points, or two-tenths of a percent, today to finish at another record high of 2,567.07.

OH, AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU, TOO
Compared with the Big Birthday today, celebrations of the arrival of less-heralded children on Dec. 25 can get lost under the tree. "You kind of get gypped your whole life," said one Christmas baby. Despite their second-class nativities, Little Richard, Isaac Newton and Humphrey Bogart survived. Page 35.
 
NEW YORK CITY
 
GIULIANI ADDS A JOB TO SUBTRACT OTHERS
Having named a Deputy Mayor whose portfolio includes social services, and then named a Commissioner to run social services, Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani created a third position to help them -- to be called Director of Social Services. Mr. Giuliani said the creation of the new job, along with two similar posts for education and health policy, would in fact shrink the Mayor's office and make it more efficient. Several other specialized offices that deal with issues ranging from AIDS to drug abuse to family services will either be pruned or combined, he said. Page 1. 

2 KILLINGS SHAKE EVEN THE HARDENED
Bedford-Stuyvesant had to confront a crime that was ghastly by any measure, even the Brooklyn neighborhood's own. The victims were a 4-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl who were found strangled with electric cord inside an apartment in the Sumner Houses. The girl's body was hanging on a closet door, investigators said. A woman was found with several stab wounds, but still alive. Detectives said her boyfriend was not a suspect. Page 35.
 
 REGION
 
COST OF CARE SLOWS DOWN
Changes in the way doctors and hospitals are paid -- how much and by whom -- have begun to curb the steady rise of health care costs in the New York region. Costs are still going up faster than overall inflation, but the annual rate of increase is the lowest in 21 years. Economists said this trend was especially noteworthy in view of the New York region's long-standing identification with high-cost health care. Page 1.
 
MUSLIM CHAPLAIN IN ARMED FORCES
He was born a Baptist, but as a young man he embraced Islam and took the name Abdul-Rasheed Muhammad. Now, the Buffalo man, who is finishing work as a prison chaplain, has also taken the rank of Army captain, becoming the first Muslim chaplain in the armed forces and a symbol of growing religious diversity. Page 36.
 
MOTEL STANDOFF ENDS PEACEFULLY
An all-night standoff between the police and a despondent man who took his girlfriend and her two children hostage in a South Hackensack, N.J., motel ended peacefully shortly before 8 A.M. The police said Wayne Cole, 24, of Paterson, surrendered without incident after keeping them at bay for 15 hours at the Jade East Motel on state Route 46, near Teterboro Airport. They said he had been drinking heavily. Page 36.

HEADLINE: For Haiti, Sanctions That Bite

 BODY:
Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has been subjected to unrelenting pressure in recent weeks to try to resolve his country's political crisis. The junta that runs Haiti has refused to step aside, as its members had agreed to do, and allow Father Aristide to govern. This week the Haitian military declined to meet with a delegation from the "Four Friends" group of countries: the U.S., Venezuela, Canada and France.
In response, the international community finally is beginning to apply pressure where it is due: on Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras and his cronies. The United States has an obligation to make sure that the pressure continues. 
 After General Cedras refused to step aside, as he agreed to do at the U.S.-sponsored Governors Island conference in October, the international community imposed half-hearted sanctions that have mostly hurt Haiti's poor while doing very little to put pressure on the people who count. While many Haitians go hungry, the members of the elite still shuttle to Miami for supplies.
Until Wednesday, Washington and other friendly governments were urging Father Aristide to agree to an international conference in Port-au-Prince -- suggested by acting Prime Minister Robert Malval -- to try to break the stalemate.
Father Aristide refused, with good reason. His allies had been assassinated and the Parliament has been unable to function for fear of political terrorism. Given that atmosphere, Father Aristide feared his supporters would not feel free to participate. He was also upset at suggestions in a French newspaper interview with Mr. Malval that participants in the conference include some well-known members of the former Duvalier dictatorship.
Father Aristide's backers have proposed an alternative conference in Miami -- a much safer venue. They have not invited the military, on the grounds that there is only one subject to discuss with the junta leaders: their date of departure.
In principle, that's correct. Politically, however, it was probably unwise. Given General Cedras's refusal to meet with the Four Friends group and his general intransigence, he would be unlikely to accept such an invitation from Father Aristide and his backers. But that would leave Father Aristide on much firmer footing to ask for tougher sanctions.
The international community has at last begun to consider sanctions that could actually hurt the country's elite. The State Department has threatened to limit private flights to and from Haiti; France has indicated that it may freeze the assets of Haiti's military rulers and their backers. It's regrettable that such steps were not considered earlier; still, they represent a welcome change. The United Nations should endorse the sanctions, including limits on commercial air traffic, and oblige compliance from all member states.
The junta has held on partly because its members were confident that the world would eventually tire of the problems of a small, poor country. Now the Haitian elite must be made to feel the pain. Washington could help immeasurably by taking the lead in tightening the sanctions and helping to make the proposed Miami conference a success.

HEADLINE: Elderly Paid Dues, But Get the Brushoff

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I'm one of those middle-class elderly people who, after working 50 years, is getting Social Security. I get the feeling that it's becoming ever more acceptable to discuss getting rid of the elderly as soon as possible. We are even being convinced that we should die or commit suicide so as not to bother anyone, particularly poor struggling youth. 
 Why don't young people look upon us as role models who have lived up to the best of the American dream? We too worked our way through college, struggled for jobs, paid for our children's college and graduate educations. We paid top-level taxes to help support poor children, the unemployed, welfare recipients, the drug addicts, mentally ill and criminals.
Our group has donated enormous amounts of volunteer time to multiple causes, and we have given billions to charities. We are still giving. We are the ones who passed the entitlement legislation in the first place. And our young ones have and will continue to benefit from it.
Should not our young also believe that if they work hard and well they too can expect the reward of a well-off old age? Or would they rather the Government told them how much income is "enough" for them? Would they rather suffer the broad hints that they should get out of the way and stop being a burden?
What do young people think we do with our money now that we've finished supporting them for their first 20 years or so? We don't burn it or hide it in a shoe box. Every cent we spend is income for someone else. The money we bank provides capital for the jobs young people take.
May today's youth respect and admire their affluent parents and grandparents! May they work hard to figure out how to make the economy work better for all of us.
And may they never forget that if they decide to buy into the trend of bashing their forebears, their own young will almost certainly do the same to them.

HEADLINE: The British Novelist Who Turned A Class System Upside Down

BYLINE: By SUZANNE CASSIDY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
When Sue Townsend's novel "The Queen and I" was published in Britain last year, she sat back and braced herself for what she was sure would be a deluge of hate mail.
After all, the novel, which was published in the United States in September by Soho Press, imagines nothing less than the overthrow of the British monarchy and the banishment of the royal family to a rough-and-tumble public housing project. Queen Elizabeth II is forced to eke out a mingy existence on state benefits. Prince Charles grows a ponytail and gets into trouble with the law. Princess Diana and Princess Anne take up with men of dubious character. Prince Philip descends into a state of filth and madness. Worst of all, the beloved Queen Mother dies. 
 As Ms. Townsend expected, one hostile letter arrived, followed by a few more. Then, nothing. Nothing, that is, except bags and bags of cheerful, appreciative, nice letters, most of which began, "I used to be a royalist, but . . ."
"I was staggered," Ms. Townsend said in mock disgust. "I thought, you know, I was going to be the darling of the anti-establishment."
 
Signs of Changing Attitudes
 "The Queen and I" spent four months at the top of The Sunday Times of London's best-seller list for hard-cover fiction, and it remains on the paperback fiction list. Read by Miriam Margolyes, it has been turned into a BBC radio series, and now it is being adapted into a play to be staged in May at the Royal Court Theater in London. This remarkable success is a measure of just how much attitudes toward the once-sacrosanct royal family have changed here.
Still, the book's British publishers, Methuen, were nervous enough about the Queen Mother's death scene to insist that the book end with a twist (which will not be revealed here).
Even today, the Queen Mother is to many Britons "like God, Jesus and Mother Teresa rolled into one," Ms. Townsend explained in an interview at her colorfully decorated Edwardian house in Leicester, the city in the East Midlands where the Queen's family is relocated in "The Queen and I."
A Buckingham Palace spokesman said it was not palace policy "to comment on works of fiction." There never was any question of legal action, he said.
A down-to-earth 47-year-old with a dry wit, Ms. Townsend is best known in Britain as the creator of Adrian Mole, an achingly pretentious but fundamentally good-hearted working-class lad who fancies himself a poet. According to Bookwatch, the market research company that compiles the best-seller lists for The Sunday Times, "The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 3/4," the first of a series of Mole books, was Britain's best-selling fiction book of the 1980's. "The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole" was the decade's best-selling hard cover in fiction.
 
A Biography Turns Into Fiction
 Ms. Townsend began writing "The Queen and I" in 1990, well before a spate of royal scandals turned the House of Windsor into a tragicomic soap opera. "It's the oldest cliche: Life will always outstrip art," she said.
Her agent, Giles Gordon, who has also been Prince Charles's literary agent, had been asked by an American publisher if Ms. Townsend would be interested in writing a biography of the Queen from a feminist perspective. Instead, she proposed writing about the monarch's "major life events" -- her marriage, the birth of her first child -- and contrasting them with her own such experiences as someone who, until she found fame as a writer, was solidly working-class. She found, however, that she couldn't do it. "I could write about her," Ms. Townsend said. "I couldn't write about me."
One evening it came to her: she would fictionalize the Queen's story. In a flash, she decided to take the monarch "away from everything she'd ever known" and see how she might fare at the other end of the social and economic spectrum.
It was a decision totally in keeping with the upbringing and political instincts of Ms. Townsend, an avowed socialist and republican.
 
Fears About the Crown
 She remembers throwing herself into the festivities surrounding the Queen's coronation on June 2, 1953. Her neighborhood held a street party and a "fancy-dress competition," to which Ms. Townsend, then age 7, went as a Gypsy, wearing a crown and veil fashioned from curtain rings and a bandana. She remembers her neighbors crowding into her family's house, the only one on the street with a television set, to watch the ceremony, and she remembers being numb with fear for the young Queen.
"The whole of the buildup to the ceremony was about the crown, which weighed five and a half pounds," she recalled. "I was really, really afraid that the crown would fall off her head."
Her parents, though socialists, believed, as almost everyone else did then, that the royals were above politics, that "they were what kept this country together."
Ms. Townsend's Gypsy costume had not long been abandoned when she decided otherwise. She simply concluded, she said, that the royals "were not gods" and therefore did not merit adulation.
 
A Worker's Fantasies
 Nothing in adulthood would change her mind. When her first husband left her to bring up three children on her own, she had to take three part-time jobs, including one as a waitress at a restaurant and bar where one of her tasks was to pick mouse droppings out of the cream pitcher. In her lowest moments, she would fantasize about being sent to prison, where, she imagined, she at least would have some peace and quiet to read books. Later she worked at a playground on the public housing project on which Hellebore Close, the royal family's new home in "The Queen and I," is based. Over the years, her conviction grew that the monarchy bore a good deal of responsibility for the class-bound nature of British society.
"Because they're at the top of the pyramid, then somebody has to be at the bottom," she explained. "When I'm in the presence of somebody who's from a higher class, I still feel very, well, inferior -- let's not mess about -- inferior. And they can be the biggest dimwit, you know, but still, you feel that."
She said she had nothing against most of the royals as people, however, and in "The Queen and I" she treated the Queen with particular gentleness.
"They are only human beings," she said. "You can't be vicious to them. That's the whole point."
 
A Last-Minute Deletion
 Of all the royal characters in "The Queen and I," the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and husband, Prince Philip, are the most harshly drawn. Princess Margaret is depicted as a whiner and a fearful snob. As for Prince Philip, Ms. Townsend said: "I was bored with him. I put him to bed, and I could not bear to get him out."
Somewhat to her relief, she had to delete the Duchess of York from the book at the last minute when the Duchess's separation from Prince Andrew was made public.
"I didn't find her that interesting, either," Ms. Townsend said. Even when the Duchess tries to be serious, the author noted, she comes across as "a very, very jolly hockey-sticks type of English girl." She added, "I mean, you don't see many of them in Leicester like that."
Just as you don't find many English writers who are willing to poke fun at the royal family.
To her, the royals are "just intrinsically funny" because "they have to pretend to be people that they're not." And that, the author said, "is always very funny."

HEADLINE: What Would Happen If . . . ?

BYLINE: By Serge Schmemann; Serge Schmemann is the Moscow bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:

RUSSIA 2010
And What It Means for the World.
By Daniel Yergin and Thane Gustafson.
300 pp. New York:
Random House. $23. 
 GUESSING Russia's future must rank among the more frustrating pursuits of businessmen, statesmen and reporters, Russian or Western. Few nations have cloaked themselves in quite as dense a cultural and political fog, and even fewer have followed a historical trail quite as erratic, careering from feudalism to Brave New World, total war, famine, global might and finally collapse, all in the span of one average lifetime. Take these last few months alone: who in early September suspected that President Boris N. Yeltsin would order tanks against the nettlesome Congress of People's Deputies, or that by year's end Russians would be voting on a new Parliament and constitution? And who today can anticipate what the results of that election might mean?
"There are two ways you can tell when a man is lying," Charles E. Bohlen, a lifelong student of Russia and United States Ambassador to Moscow from 1953 to 1957, used to say. "One is when he says he can drink champagne all night and not get drunk. The other is when he says he understands Russians."
Yet try we must to understand, if only because Russia's last incarnation, as an Evil Empire, posed the foremost challenge to our lives and well-being for so long, and its next one could shape our world for decades to come. The trouble is that too much latter-day prophesying is based on either wishful thinking ("They're a great people -- I just know the Russians will make it") or dubious myths ("They've always been expansionist -- sooner or later they'll try to rebuild their empire").
For all of us who dabble in trying to divine whither Russia, Daniel Yergin and Thane Gustafson have performed an invaluable service. No, they do not discover where Russia is headed. What they do in "Russia 2010" is to play out "what would happen if . . ." -- if Russia continues as is, if a nationalist government comes to power, if the military comes to power, if Chernobyl blows again, if President Yeltsin is assassinated -- and they do it in a way non-Kremlinologists will have no trouble following. Mr. Yergin is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power," in which he demonstrated a talent for parlaying cold research into a snappy yarn. Mr. Gustafson is a professor of government at Georgetown University and the author of several books on the Soviet Union.
Essentially, the authors set up a methodology for intelligent prophesying -- sorting out the myths from the social, political and economic forces at play in Russia, then stacking those forces up in different ways and throwing in the odd surprise. The year 2010 was chosen, they explain, because that will mark the 25th anniversary of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rise to power.
Mr. Yergin and Mr. Gustafson tell us that their book grew out of studies done by Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm of which they are, respectively, president and director. The work shows symptoms of haste, as if the authors hurried to expand one or more studies into a book and did not have time to smooth the transitions or order the concepts. Some chapters are scenarios, some are straightforward analysis, some are commentaries on how American policy should be shaped.
The work also has the obvious disadvantage of dealing with a moving target. It was written before Mr. Yeltsin scattered the Congress of People's Deputies, and it will be read after the results of the parliamentary elections are known.
But these weaknesses do not really detract from the usefulness or enjoyment of the book. Changing events, in fact, only make it more like a sophisticated board game, challenging the reader to deduce how the shifting factors might alter the various scenarios.
The scenarios account for only 56 pages of the book, but they are its real core, and what elevates it above the bloated body of available works on Russia. There are four of them, and each is written from the vantage point of the year 2010, tracing events that brought Russia either to collapse, civil war, a military regime or miraculous prosperity.
At one extreme is what the authors call the "Russian Bear" scenario: The date is May 17, 2010, and a military parade is being held in Red Square to mark the eighth anniversary of the army coup. Double-headed eagles glint from tanks and the Kremlin towers, and banners read "Hail to Our Supreme Commander and to the Glorious Russian Army."
At the other extreme is "Chudo," Russian for "miracle": May 17, 2010, in this scenario marks the inauguration of a state-of-the-art trading center for the Moscow Stock Exchange, at which the head of Russia's largest bank announces the acquisition of the seventh largest bank in the United States.
The scenarios in between range from the slow unwinding of the Russian state under political and economic paralysis to a Russia ruled by an authoritarian alliance of bureaucrats, defense industrialists, state industry managers, the army and the police.
Anyone who is at all familiar with Russia is certain to find points of argument, to disagree with the plausibility of a development, to question a conclusion. But that is very much part of the fun -- moving or changing the building blocks of a model and wondering what emerges.
That is also the usefulness of the study. Though Mr. Yergin and Mr. Gustafson map out scenarios ranging from civil war to prosperity, they identify several realities that will exist in 2010 no matter what road Russia takes.
One is heartening: "Under all scenarios, Russia is likely to keep up its gradual return to the world economy." Another is discouraging: "There will be no strong agricultural revival in Russia by 2010, even if farming becomes largely private. The countryside has been so systematically emptied of its best people that many areas are incapable of supporting modern agriculture."
Ultimately, both of these conclusions derive as much from analysis as from instinct and imagination. Having spent the better part of 13 years in Moscow, this reviewer found each of the scenarios intriguing and plausible, less for the facts and figures than for the appreciation of the many intangible factors that shape modern Russia.
The oft-invoked "Russian character" does play a big role in these models, but as a consequence of concrete factors, not as some hereditary handicap. The authors write: "The reasons why chaos has not broken out in Russia have little to do with 'Russian stolidity,' 'stoicism' or other supposed traits of Russian national character. Rather, enough of the old system still survives, and enough of a new one has emerged, to keep most people fed, clothed, housed -- and busy."
Above all, Mr. Yergin and Mr. Gustafson understand that Russia's future will be shaped by its own unique past and present, however frustrating this may appear from the sidelines: "Ultimately, of course, Russia will make its own history. . . . The evolution of Russian politics will be a Russian game, played mostly by Russian players, and largely over Russian issues."
But with their book as guide, we can at least follow that game.
 
 
 
AN IMPERIAL CONSCIOUSNESS
 Russia faces a fundamental challenge in the coming years. It is to find a new identity in an era when the rebirth of nationalism and ethnicity is the central and frequently destabilizing factor in all the former Communist countries. Russia dominated its neighbors for hundreds of years; its sense of national identity and national interests arose in conjunction with its imperial destiny, and was inseparable from it. Russia is a very significant military power and will remain so for the foreseeable future. It retains a vast nuclear arsenal and a large conventional force. . . .
But Russia has yet to fully accept that it has lost its empire -- indeed, many do not yet recognize the loss -- and it will take years to fully digest this fact. It will take more than diminished means to change Russia's self-perception as an imperial state. After all, one could argue that some in France retain an imperial consciousness, even though France gave up its empire in 1958. But for Russia, unlike France, the former empire lies just beyond its borders, remains economically part of it and contains 25 million of its own people.
To make matters still more difficult, Russia has not only lost its external and internal empire, it must now deal on an equal footing with former subject states whose own history of independence and statehood is somewhat ambiguous. Russia will only become a post-imperial state if the forces that propelled it to empire are no longer operative in the next century and it can coexist with its immediate neighbors.

JAMES BEARD
A Biography.
By Robert Clark.
357 pp. New York:
HarperCollins Publishers. $27.50. 
 IN an afterword to his painstaking and admirably unvarnished life of one of America's best-known food authorities, Robert Clark finally acknowledges that it's not easy to say just who or what James Beard really was.
"Words like chef, cooking teacher and food writer all came to mind," he writes in "James Beard: A Biography," "yet these were all labels that failed to capture entirely what he was, or what he did." What's more, Mr. Clark maintains, they were labels that "he himself often detested." Rather lamely, he concludes: "In the end, Beard's measure may now consist less of his achievements or occupations than of the things he came to symbolize."
In fact, neither James Beard's achievements nor his occupations were insignificant. He wrote 22 books. Half are still in print, and several remain classics of the food-writing genre. Throughout his long life, he fought for honesty and simplicity in the kitchen. He championed fresh native ingredients over watered-down industrial products, and although he loved France, he loved simple American cooking even more.
When he died in 1985 at the age of 81, Craig Claiborne, one of his proteges, praised him in The New York Times as "an innovator, an experimenter, a missionary in bringing the gospel of good cooking to the home table."
In 1946, he initiated America's first television program on food. His classes, in New York, in California, in his native Oregon and as far afield as the Gritti Palace in Venice, brought his skills and enthusiasm to three generations of cooks, both amateur and professional. He was generous with his time and knowledge -- a rare trait in the narrow world of food writing, a milieu notorious for its pettiness and infighting.
Few if any American cooks can say they have never been influenced by James Beard, whether it was through his books, his television and radio appearances, his newspaper columns or his cooking classes. But there was a darker side to the gentle culinary giant (6 feet 2 inches tall, well over 300 pounds). He was a frustrated singer and actor who never subdued his craving for center stage. Freelance food writing is not now, nor was it ever, particularly lucrative. So James Beard became a shill for the food industry, whose products he often loathed. In the years when an article for a food magazine might have earned him $500, a product endorsement, which involved no work, might bring in $10,000.
He became adept, Mr. Clark writes, "at reducing the actual cash costs of living by amassing trade-offs, favors and freebies." A plug for Air France in his book "Paris Cuisine" defrayed travel costs to Europe "for the next few years."
At one time or another, according to Mr. Clark, Jim Beard worked for or endorsed Adolph's Meat Tenderizer, Skotch Cooler picnic containers, Green Giant canned and frozen vegetables, French cognac, Old Crow whisky, Pillsbury, Restaurant Associates, Time-Life Books, Spice Islands, American Airlines, Planters Peanuts, Swift & Company, Du Pont, Shasta Beverages, Corning Glass, Jenn-Air kitchen ranges and Omaha Steaks International, among many other companies.
He had few illusions about this work. In revelatory moments he could refer to himself as "the world's greatest gastronomic whore." But in a speech he gave in the early 1960's, Beard said, and apparently with a straight face: "I think it is safe to say that in the majority of our homes food is appetizing, healthful and tasty. Without our food writers, backed by our great food industry, this would not be true."
James Beard was born in Portland, Ore., and never lost his love for the Pacific Northwest, its climate, its beaches and, above all, its food. In later life he would return there often to renew his energy and recapture a bit of his youth.
When he tired of the New York life, he would talk of opening a country restaurant or of doing the kind of literate food books that M. F. K. Fisher wrote. Nothing came of these reveries. Mr. Clark writes: "Even James's fantasies of a quiet and decent life of craftsmanship were, as he would be the first to recognize, tinged by a purplish undercurrent of grandiosity, greed and cynicism."
In Mr. Clark's hands, Beard is often sad, occasionally embarrassing but never dull. Nor for that matter are any of the supporting players in the story, from Poppy Cannon, whom he calls "America's first lady of the freezer," to Dione Lucas, "queen of the omelet," to Julia Child, "a droll six-footer with a Seven Sisters tone." (Beard was no slouch himself in the sharp-phrase department. His description of one female competitor: "Bitchery incarnate.")
Mr. Clark, a former editor of The Journal of Gastronomy, portrays James Beard against a backdrop of America's postwar infatuation with food. A conscientious researcher as well as a rattling good writer, he traces the social and economic forces that produced Betty Crocker and the Four Seasons, frozen peas and the Galloping Gourmet. He has given us a vivid portrait of a sometimes bizarre but ultimately fascinating man of our times. But his real achievement is having produced a valuable and thoroughly engrossing work of contemporary cultural history.

Dollars That Make Sense

 BODY:
It's no secret that America's monetary policy is a mess. Not the policy set by the Federal Reserve; the one made by the United States Mint. The problem is the penny and the dollar.
Pennies are so unpopular that something like 6 billion, give or take a billion or two, disappear each year (last year, 9 billion were produced). Presumably they run off to mate with lost socks. The dollar bill is also getting tiresome (for people lucky enough to have them in bulk). The Southern California Transit District sells crumpled dollars at 97 cents each to a subcontractor who unwrinkles them by hand. Anti-dollar bill advocates claim that a dollar coin could save the Government $395 million or more a year. The clean policy seems obvious: Ban the bill. Drop the penny. What's the problem? 
 Well, with money nothing is ever simple. Over time, pennies have lost much of their value to inflation but they are still a source of profit for the Mint. They cost less than a penny to make and distribute. And then there is the zinc lobby. Since 1982, pennies, only coated with copper, have been made almost entirely of zinc, which has helped pull the zinc industry through some rough times.
As to the dollar coin, which is once again under consideration by Congress, it is still in bad odor because of the Susan B. Anthony dollar, which felt too much like a quarter and thus became the Edsel of coins.
There is, however a way out of both of these problems. If the mint got rid of the dollar bill, people would have to use the dollar coin. If the dollar coin were different in size, feel and color from a quarter, it would not be a source of confusion. And if the dollar coins were made out of zinc, the loss of the penny market would be nullified. Then just about everybody should be happy.

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN THE ARTS: Architecture/1993;
A Year More Remarkable For What (or Who) Was Destroyed Than for What Was Built

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
New World Disorder -- From the World Trade Center to the Mostar Bridge, images of exploding buildings dominated 1993, each hinting more graphically than the year's new buildings at some larger story that began with the end of the cold war and is still unfolding.
 
Stone, Brick and Savagery -- In Washington, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, designed by James Ingo Freed, rose to the excruciating challenge of making art out of the unspeakable. 

Coming and Going -- Urban decentralization and downtown renewal collided imaginatively in Ohio in Peter Eisenman's Greater Columbus Convention Center, a building whose serpentine roof snakes across the city's edge like an inner state freeway.
 
Yes, in My Back Yard -- In Phoenix, an ambitious program that joins art to infrastructure reached a high point with the opening of a recycling center, designed by the artists Linnea Glatt and Michael Singer to transform a landfill into a landmark.
 
Disfigured Landscape -- Despite protests from architects and scholars over an addition to the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences in La Jolla, Calif., bulldozers moved in to demolish a eucalyptus grove that formed the symbolic entrance to Louis Kahn's radiant fusion of architecture, land, sea and sky.
 
Book of the Year -- "Architecture Culture 1943-1968," Joan Ockman's documentary account of postwar modernism, revealed the creative ferment of a period often dismissed as sterile, and sketched an intellectual genealogy for today's emerging architects.
 
Hello to All That -- Frank Gehry remodeled his Santa Monica house, a building that inspired a generation of architects and will continue to invigorate those who value architecture as an art of living.
 
A Loss -- The death of Robert Wagner Jr., a veteran politician and urbanist who was expected to guide the city planning policies of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, cast gloom over those who were counting on Mr. Wagner to revive New York's lapsed coalition between political leadership and urban design.

HEADLINE: What a Police Force Should Look Like

 BODY:
Re: "Nassau's New Police Officers Shape Up" [Dec. 12], it is important for us in Nassau and Suffolk Counties to recognize that employment discrimination is a source of tension in police-community relations. This is so primarily because it makes our police departments appear to be all-white, or predominantly white, institutions in the eyes of racial-minority communities.
The basis of support for policing our society must come from all citizens. Given this basic tenet, it follows that police agencies should be representative of the populations they serve. To be otherwise diminishes their ability to respond empathetically to many community concerns and reinforces the perception held by some segments of the minority public that law-enforcement agencies represent the force of the dominant society, to preserve the status quo. 
 The importance of minority police officers cannot be overemphasized. It is not only a question of equal access to an economically desirable government position, but it is also a question of effective policing. It is extremely difficult for members of an underrepresented group to view the police as being responsive to their needs, free of prejudice and interested in the cause of justice if they do not see members of their group on the force. The importance of ethnic identification makes it essential that the agents of justice reflect the characteristics of the community.
It's encouraging to see 38 blacks, Hispanics and females in the current 200-member Nassau County Police Department recruit class. This good feeling is jaded somewhat inasmuch as this fact necessitated a Federal lawsuit by the Nassau County Guardians in conjunction with the U.S. Justice Department alleging bias in the testing process. However, the end product is a positive one -- opening the door to a police agency truly representative of all Nassau's citizens.

HEADLINE: Seizing the Moment for a Shorter-Term Mortgage

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
JOHN McCREADY says that he was born and brought up in the South Bronx and that "because of that fantastic education, you always know when you're being taken and when you're not."
So when mortgage rates began to plummet, he and his wife, Rita, who own a red and white aluminum-sided house in New Rochelle, N.Y., started reading the financial pages every day, watching the mortgage rates and examining the deals being offered by competing banks. 
 "It was driving me crazy," said the 42-year-old Mr. McCready. "I was paying $1,400 a month on a $150,000, 30-year mortgage and after four years I still owed $148,000. Even my bookie gives me better odds."
Like millions of other Americans, the McCreadys decided the time was ripe to refinance their house. And like about half of the homeowners who chose a fixed-rate mortgage, they took one for 15 years.
Donna Calejon, a senior vice president of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), which purchases home mortgages from primary lenders, said that 15- and 30-year refinancings were "running almost neck and neck" in popularity. Last week Fannie Mae officials estimated that while the number of refinancings by homeowners would decline in 1994, there is expected to be a 17 percent rise in new mortgages -- those obtained to finance a purchase.
In all this activity, the movement toward shorter-term mortgages is clear: In October 1990, 12,400 families signed up for a Fannie Mae-approved 15- or 20-year mortgage; in October, 106,997 families turned to these shorter-term mortgages. A spokesman last week reported a "steady increase" in 15-year fixed-rate purchase mortgages.
"It isn't spiking up like the 15-year refinances, but it's steady growth," he said. Overall, 62 percent of Fannie Mae's 1993 business has been refinancing; purchase mortgages made up the rest.
Mortgage brokers and real estate agents said that for the first-time younger buyer, the 30-year mortgage was still the mortgage of choice. And the young person with an entry-level job still may choose a variable-rate mortgage, with the lowest monthly payment of all. They said the buyer interested in a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was usually financially secure, with a larger income but with less need for the longer-term tax breaks the 30-year mortgage allowed.
"We're seeing more and more buyers taking advantage of the 15-year option, but it's a sophisticated market," said Margie Wexler, an agent at Julia B. Fee, a Westchester brokerage. "We counsel them about what it takes to qualify; we may recommend a bank or a mortgage broker for them to talk with."
While customers shopping for year-end mortgage deals will not find the "free" appraisals available several years ago, there are nevertheless some deals around.
Mortgage brokers say that there are variations between banks and that even the most conservative keep an eye on their equally conservative competition. Many people don't know, said Ronnie Goldstein, a regional mortgage broker, that banks have sales quotas and may offer established customers slight savings to "make it worth their while" to close by a certain day.
MS. GOLDSTEIN worked with one couple seeking a sizable mortgage who didn't care whether they closed by the end of this year or the beginning of the next. But the bank did, and shaved an eighth of a point off their rate as an incentive.
Sol Waxman, a mortgage broker who serves Manhasset and Manhattan, said some banks offered the best-qualified buyers loans up to 100 percent of the current value of their home, rather than the conventional 80 percent. This lets someone whose house has decreased in value switch to keep the same mortgage amount at today's lower rates.
The McCreadys are an example of buyers who did their homework. With mortgage rates lower than they have been in decades, they found that they could cut in half the life of the existing mortgage and still have the same pre-tax-deduction monthly payment by switching the interest rate from 10.875 percent to 7.75 percent through refinancing.
Their loan balance is now declining far more rapidly -- by about $460 a month at present. By the time the McCreadys' son and daughter, now 5 and 3, go off to college, the mortgage will be almost paid off.
Over the 15 years of their new $150,000 loan, the McCreadys will pay a total of $254,145, including the extra charges for appraisals and processing. If they had kept their old 30-year mortgage at the higher rate, they would have paid a total of $509,162 -- almost twice as much. He estimated his savings, after tax deductions, at about $170,000 with the shorter-term mortgage.
Ira Drosnin, a 48-year-old Manhattan accountant, is an example of the sophisticated first-time buyer with the income to afford the higher payments of the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage. He and his wife, Roberta, a vice president at Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, just traded their large, but noisy, rent-stabilized one-bedroom apartment at 34th Street and Third Avenue for a house on Shore Acres Drive in the Rye Neck section of Mamaroneck, across the street from Long Island Sound.
"We just bought a Jeep," he said. "We're having culture shock and we haven't even moved in yet." Mr. Drosnin said he originally had told the mortgage broker he wanted a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.
"BUT being an accountant, I naturally ran the numbers through a computer program, and the total payments are hundreds of thousands of dollars less," he said. "Sure, you get the tax write-off for 15 years longer, but nobody's in the 100 percent tax bracket . . . " He paused. "Yet."
In 15 years, Mr. Drosnin will turn 63, he said, "a nice time for the mortgage to be paid off and to live rent-free."
Susan Severance, who sells advertising for a magazine, thought she could manage the extra 6 percent a month for her 15-year mortgage. "It's not so different," she said. "It's half a car payment."
Ms. Severance, who is 40 and has short blond hair and a friendly, husky voice, explained that because of the poor real estate market, she and her husband, Steven Esformes, "took a bath" on selling their smaller house: they had paid $168,000 for it and sold it for $138,000.
But the market worked for them when they went to buy a bigger house in South Orange, N.J. The 5,000-square-foot, 7-bedroom 1921 colonial revival would have sold for close to $500,000 in the heyday of the 80's, she said, but they paid $300,000 -- and it is three times bigger than their other house.
"It's a cool house in a really cool area," Ms. Severance said. "We made out great. If we didn't have a 15-year mortgage I'd have to keep working forever. We wouldn't pay it off until I was dead. These are our peak earning years, and we want to make the whole thing as short and painless as possible."
Dr. Vito Guarnaccia, a consulting psychologist in White Plains, wants to make his repayment even shorter. He just closed on a large refinanced mortgage to cover both his house and a $250,000 home equity loan he took out a couple of years ago to invest in garden apartment condominiums -- and hopes to pay it back in "eight or nine years."
Dr. Guarnaccia said that with the $250,000 home equity loan, he could deduct only up to $100,000 on his income tax, but with the new refinanced loan at 6.875 percent, he can deduct the whole thing. Deductions are limited to $100,000 on home equity loans.
Obviously, his home's value was supported by the bank appraisal. Those whose houses are not worth as much as they are trying to borrow will be denied the new loan.
"Everyone is saying they are waiting for interest rates to hit rock bottom," Dr. Guarnaccia said. "But the day they reach bottom means the next day they start climbing."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: PROFILE;
Officer Revisits His Old, New Neighborhood

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Vincent Mansfield, who grew up in Flushing more than two decades ago, just landed a job in his old neighborhood. But things have changed since his youth, when the Gertz department store was Main Street's retail giant and the RKO Keith's movie theater packed in matinee crowds.
Many of the mom-and-pop stores are gone, replaced with gleaming Asian banks and restaurants. And scores of temples, mosques and churches, many of them serving new immigrants, have opened. 
 "The differences are very visible," Captain Mansfield said one morning last week, just days after he became commander of the 109th Precinct. "There's a real difference in the flavor of the neighborhood. It definitely makes me feel old."
Still, some things haven't changed. Drag racing continues along Francis Lewis Boulevard. And, he noted, "There are still the two pizza parlors that I went to as a teen-ager."
Captain Mansfield, who is 47 years old, assumed the new post after spending more than two years as commander of the 112th Precinct in Forest Hills, a less diverse and more middle-class area.
He says there are many challenges ahead of him as he charts the future for the 109th Precinct, which has more than 300 officers and clerical workers serving an area that is undergoing a dramatic cultural and economic transformation amid a tide of immigration.
Captain Mansfield says he plans to build upon the legacy of his predecessor, Deputy Inspector John Timony, who is credited with fostering better relations between the area's new Asian immigrants, many of them from Korea and China, and the precinct's officers.
Deputy Inspector Timony, for instance, hired more Asian-American officers and clerical workers to strengthen ties between the precinct and the neighborhood's newcomers.
"Without question, that will be a top priority," Captain Mansfield said.
He said the nature of police work is changing. He likened it to the changes in doctor-patient relationships, with physicians having to be less dictatorial and more receptive to patients' needs and desires.
Above all, though, he says he wants to focus on the problems that have always concerned people in Flushing, College Point, Whitestone and other neighborhoods within the 109th Precinct: burglary, graffiti, loitering, public drunkenness and car theft.
Under his command at the 112th Precinct, officers reduced car thefts by 613, or 16 percent, during his last year there, he said.
"These are the issues that affect the fabric of the city," he said.
Before Captain Mansfield makes any moves, though, he acknowledges that he has more immediate concerns within the 109th Precinct station house itself.
"I got to get to know who the cops are around here first," he said. RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

Can a Mayor Make a Difference?

 BODY:
NEXT weekend, Rudolph W. Giuliani will be inaugurated as the 107th mayor of New York City. There will be hoopla and many bold words.
But can a mayor really make a difference? Fiscal monitors judge his every move. An ailing economy puts him in a box. Strong unions tie his hands. And AIDS, drugs and poverty are problems hardly unique to New York. Can a mayor really set a course for the city? 
 Some New Yorkers were asked to answer the question and predict what's ahead for the next four years.
 
THE REV. JOHN J. JENIK , the pastor of Our Lady of Refuge Roman Catholic Church in Fordham-Bedford Park, the Bronx, has organized boycotts of stores that were drug fronts.
 
THERE is no will to fight crime anymore. No municipal will. No community will. People are too frightened. It permeates the whole system. Our past mayors -- I don't know where their mind-sets were. Possibly they let it happen because they live in areas not affected by this. Where is the planning coming from? We need some Draconian measures -- property rights have to be weighed against the well-being of the community. Right now, if a man is selling drugs from a store, you can't shut it down -- they say he doesn't own the space, he just rents it.
The right mayor can be an advocate for the people suffering under laws that do not help them in crisis. People want to hear some assurances that they are safe on their own streets. A mayor can help make the institutional environment very hostile to anybody involved in drugs who is going to come before an agency.
An effort will be made to get some of the drug dealers off the street. But the energy will be dissipated. There's not enough money for guards. The courts will become overcrowded. It will just take too much energy. It's like building a power station without the lines to carry the power.
 
ANGELO FALCON , a political scientist, is president and founder of the institute for Puerto Rican Policy, a nonprofit, nonpartisan policy center based in New York City.
 
A MAYOR makes a tremendous difference. Whoever is mayor has to take to the stage of city government, much as does an actor, to creatively play out the daily drama and comedy of a city wrapped up so tightly that it is always in danger of being committed. A mayor can capture this collective imagination and energy to make more substantive changes possible.
As for more substantive changes, a mayor can make a difference if he or she does not mind being a one-termer -- the ultimate civic sacrifice, made necessary by the many strong constituencies on both sides of almost every issue. Ironically, this quixotic attitude may be rewarded by New Yorkers. Conditioned to expect high levels of cynicism, they may reward a more straightforward approach.
How Mayor Giuliani deals with the racial-ethnic divide will define whether he will make a difference. Unfortunately, his actions will be driven by his re-election and the fact of his razor-thin margin of victory this time around. This would mean the fiscal sleight of hand we have become accustomed to, the search for a more solid majority of the vote that could reach out to Latinos at the expense of blacks, and the continual caving in to the city's rich and powerful.
 
CAVERLY STRINGER , who says he "sleeps here and there," is the senior editor of Street News.
 
I DON'T want anything from a mayor. I don't see being on the street as the Great American Tragedy, but others are terrified. It's not something a mayor can solve. People are going on drugs in droves because they're spiritually empty. They just cop out.
You can't legislate humanity. Things now are very secular and very selfish -- it's them against us. We're all trying to draw in the wagons and protect our turf. That's doomed to fail. A mayor can create an environment that says, "No, it's not acceptable to say, 'This is my side of the street and leave me alone.' " But how is he going to get elected?
Mayors are like the change in weather to me. You have to gear yourself up for atmospheric changes, but you still have to get through the day-to-day. Sometimes mayors have an impact. They told people to stop giving to panhandlers in midtown, so the panhandlers followed the money uptown to the neighborhoods.
Giuliani is provoking more of a them-versus-us thing. You've got his police commissioner saying he'll take back the streets door to door. He may let an element of fascism in. The new commissioner says New Yorkers want discipline. But what's going on is that they want to homogenize, purify the society.
I witnessed something the other night. A gentleman was drinking a beer on Ninth Avenue. A cop jumped out of a car and said put it down. He smashed the beer. He said: "There's a new program here. We're gonna get rid of scum like you, then the crackheads and others like you."
There are people waiting for this to happen. But you can't be a leader and pander to that.
 
RICHARD GREEN is head of the Crown Heights Youth Collective.
 
THE mayor sets the tone, the temperament, the intensity. He sets the level of consciousness.
These young people are more politically astute than you think. Theymake determinations. They will look at the new City Hall to see if this is an improved product.
In the last four years, they saw beacon schools and they saw outreach. You walk into a youth services office now and young people are greeting you. They're involved. They see a commissioner walking the streets with them, a hot line to call. Now they can relate to what youth services is about. Is it going to change? If it gets better they're happy with it. We got 1,000 summer jobs in Crown Heights in 1992. It would not have happened unless Dinkins picked up the slack. Because of the Safe Street/Safe Cities program, cops and youth get along better.
With Giuliani, the first thing is we'll sit down and talk. I think he wants to figure out what's working. I pray this is what's going to happen. If you inherit the Philharmonic, you don't change the musicians. You've got to play into the character of the city. Basically, he'll stand pat.
 
MARY A. CUMMINS , a member of the District 24 school board in Queens, led the fight against Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez over a curriculum that included teaching respect for gay people.
 
I LOOK around the city and, I tell you, to try to clean it up would make cleaning out the Augean stables seem like a light dusting job. Can a mayor make a difference? In some things, yes. In others, no. He can show leadership. That's the main thing anyone can do as the head of a government. If you can show leadership, then I think you can get some things done. A lot depends on the people he appoints. That is the most powerful thing he can do. Frankly, with the city in the state that it is in, I don't know why anyone would want the job.
Giuliani remains to be seen. Of course, I voted for George Marlin, but I have an open mind. Dinkins was a farce. I had an open mind about him, but he fell short. Anybody could. We won't know for sure until he's been in there awhile.
 
MATT LEE is the executive director of Inner City Press/Community on the Move, an advocacy group for low-income housing.
 
THE mayor means very little. The basic relations of power stay the same. New York is so dependent on financial services and the global economy that mayors have to be supplicants to businesses. There is a fixation on financial services. But ghetto people are not getting those jobs.
The root problem is the lack of a long-term power base in low-income communities. Mayors, because of political pressures, do not understand this. Dinkins did boost money to community groups, but it was like staring into a mirror. His people only talked to the people who agreed with them.
A lot of big groups in the South Bronx get a fee by becoming the marketing agent for middle-income housing. If they stop being the sponsor, they lose power. Instead of saying, "This housing is not affordable to people who live here," they end up saying it's going to be thrown down anyway, so we might as well become the marketing agent. By building housing in a way that doesn't build indigenous power, there is no grass-roots political structure to constantly advocate what needs to be done.
Under Giuliani, community groups will be more willing to fight City Hall since they'll be less concerned about making the city's first African-American mayor look bad. Low-income groups were in Dinkins's back pocket. The idea was just to your piece of the action.
 
TONY HISS , a staff writer for The New Yorker, is the author of "The Experience of Place." (Vintage)
 
I'VE lived on Eighth Street in Greenwich Village almost all my life and watched it go from distinguished to so-so to chaotic. Next year, the city will let the Village Alliance start a privately financed Business Improvement District on Eighth Street, with its own security and sanitation crews. To announce this plan, the alliance has put up Christmas lights and holiday banners along Eighth Street and St. Marks Place, from Sixth Avenue to Second Avenue. The lights are looped to form giant snowflakes.
This tiny and very temporary change has been casting its own magic spell. Instead of hurrying by, people look up and smile, and then grin at each other; months before the new street cleaners go to work, there's already less trash underfoot. Somehow the lights have reconnected Eighth Street to itself, reminding people that this is the Main Street of a world-famous neighborhood.
New Yorkers are especially fed up right now. But it's at times like these that a new mayor can make a difference, if he connects to the people who are already trying to make a difference. I see neighborhoods all over the city taking tiny, first steps that will (with a mayor's help) bring on dramatic changes. I think Mayor Giuliani will find himself sponsoring street-smart ideas like putting up white street lights in place of these sickly yellow ones that make shadows darker. A truly safe street is a street you can take pride in.
 
REPRESENTATIVE SUSAN MOLINARI , a Republican, represents Staten Island and a part of Brooklyn.
 
THE mayor matters terrifically. It is one of the most important positions in the country, if not the world. New York's ability to rise and fall gives or deletes hope for other cities. If New York can survive, others can, too. New York should be setting urban priorities in America. We have got to be more of a national player. Also, the mayor can create a environment so that businesses will move to and stay in the city. The mayor can set priorities. If Rudy had been elected in 1989, perhaps we wouldn't be dealing with the budget problem today. We wouldn't be dealing with a demoralized police force.
I predict Rudy will make four years of terrifically unpopular decisions that will leave our city stronger and him a mayor for the history books. It is more important to him to restore the city than be popular. In Washington the city is seen as sloppy. There are so many instances of the misuse of money or the city's failing to access Federal money with the same resolve as other cities. On the Federal level, Rudy's resolve will engender good will.

Living Where Edison Filmed

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Construction of a much-awaited apartment building for the low-income elderly was completed earlier this month at the very spot where Thomas A. Edison's studio made movies nearly a century ago.
At least 40 tenants are expected to start moving into the new building, called the Edison Arms, next month. The building has 69 studio and one-bedroom apartments, all of them being rented for $400 a month to individuals or couples. 
 The $6 million construction project at Oliver Place and Decatur Avenue is being sponsored by the Fordham Bedford Housing Corporation, a community group, and by Fordham University.
The project is being financed with loans from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The sponsors of the project are continuing to interview prospective tenants for the remaining 19 apartments -- a process that began this summer with a lottery and that has received more than three applicants for each apartment.
The project began more than a year ago at a cost of $6 million. It has resurrected a lot that was overrun with litter and other debris ever since 1977, when the city demolished the vacant building that housed Edison's movie studio.
For years, residents and civic leaders complained that the lot was a persistent blemish on the landscape of a neighborhood that had been struggling to overcome years of urban deterioration and neglect.
"It was unsightly and it didn't engender a lot of pride for the people in the community," said Joe Muriana, the director of the university's Office of Government Relations and Urban Affairs.
The sponsors have been involved in other similar restoration projects, among them the Rose Hill Houses, another apartment building for the low-income elderly that the university sponsored in the area several years ago.
The university and the Fordham Bedford Housing Corporation had been pressing for development of the vacant lot where the new building stands and bought the property from the city in September 1992.
"We're hopeful that this project will be something that will help stabilize that part of the community," Mr. Muriana said.
"It'll be another element in shoring up a neighborhood that's been under a good deal of stress lately," he added. R.H.

HEADLINE: The World;
A World Unhinged Gropes for New Rules

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

 BODY:
AT a time when past certainties -- the constraints of totalitarianism and the comforts of faith -- either have been swept away or are under assault, Dostoyevskian thoughts about the fragility of the barrier between civilization and chaos come easily to mind.
In both Western Europe and North America, what might be called an age of unbelief has sharply challenged and eroded traditional religious, moral and ethical codes, and both economic and social change have put tremendous pressure on traditional family structures. Together with problems like racism and poverty in inner cities, these changes have been accompanied by horrendous crime rates and rampant drug use. 
 In the formerly Communist world, Marxist-Leninist social and political standards have been completely discredited, but new ones have not yet taken their place. Demoralized populations groping for values to guide them through a painful political and economic transition have grasped at the too-simple answers offered by ultranationalism -- in the bloodied lands of the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere. Many did so two weeks ago in Dostoyevsky's land, where parliamentary elections catapulted a man who evokes the worst of Hitler and Stalin alarmingly into the international limelight.
Civilization has been through periods of simultaneous political and religious upheaval, like the Hundred Years' War, before. Yet modern communications, modern weapons and modern Angst make the current one seem even more bewildering.
After all, religion is not dead; religious revivalists thrive in many parts of the world where traditional values clash with modern secular and commercial ones. But the struggle is the more turbulent for not having been resolved. Militant Islam is one answer thrown up by a traditional society's bewilderment at the intrusion of alien modern ideas, but its repressive answers to them -- indeed, its seeming embrace of terrorism in Iran, Egypt, and many other places, including the World Trade Center -- only add to the general sense of anomie.
 
Value-less
 For as old, traditional moral, ethical and religious values have been swept away, they have often been replaced by a relativistic ethos that is easily construed to mean "anything goes." St. Paul pointed out the inadequacies of this 2,000 years ago: "Where no law is, there is no transgression," he wrote to the Romans.
And so in America, "Greed is good" -- Gordon Gecko's motto in "Wall Street" -- was also a prevailing theme of the real-life 1980's, and small wonder that petty criminals who couldn't get in on the corporate boom went for whatever they could get on the streets. Inhibitions on criminal behavior are weakest where institutions like the family that convey values from one generation to the next have been most severely ravaged.
In the old Communist world, the loss of ethical norms was long masked by the monolithic grayness of corrupt totalitarianism. In the Soviet Union since Stalin's time, the Communist Party and the state laid down the law, telling citizens what to do, where to live and how to think. In the ideology, capitalism and "biznes" were the embodiment of evil. By the late 1980's, Communism was collapsing. Freedom replaced its strictures, but many of its values remained in place. Raised to believe that "biznes" was amoral and that capitalists could treat people any way they liked, many of the new "biznesmyeni" began acting more like Mafiosi than respectable entrepreneurs.
 
Losing Ground
 The ethical underpinnings that make civilized commercial transactions possible in the Western world -- binding contracts, fair dealing and so on -- take time to grow. But many ordinary Russians have concluded that President Boris N. Yeltsin's transition to a market economy means that black marketeers and criminals can careen through the streets in fat Mercedes limousines while the rest are reduced to selling old clothes to earn enough money to survive. And many expressed their dissatisfaction by voting for Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, a radical nationalist who promised to restore the glory days when Russia was a superpower.
Traditional structures seem to be losing ground everywhere. Prosperous Western Europe is seeing its previously accepted values eroded as it tries to come to terms with the end of the cold war, with the flood of refugees from economic and political chaos to the east, and with rising unemployment caused by the inadequacies of its welfare states in an era of sharp new competition with the Far East and Eastern Europe.
Dr. Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, a German poll taker, recently recalled that in 1967, fully 71 percent of young Germans believed that children should be raised to do work "properly and conscientiously." By 1972, only 52 percent of them did. The Ten Commandments fared little better, Dr. Noelle-Neumann found: "The precepts according to which one should not use force, not lie, not steal were slowly but steadily eroded in West Germany between 1981 and 1990," she observed.
In officially atheist East Germany, as long as it was strict and Communist, this was not the case, and traditional middle-class German values survived there right up to 1990. So what, many might argue. East Germany was hardly a model in other ways, and German history from 1933 to 1945 proved that traditional values were no guarantee against evil. But a moral collapse of some kind lies behind the recent years of rising violence, predominantly by young Germans, against foreign workers and asylum-seekers in a country that had tolerated millions of Turkish "guest workers" for decades.
Religious leaders in Britain, alarmed that less that 2 percent of the population bothers with the Church of England anymore on Sundays, anguished this fall over whether the collapse of religious life could somehow explain how two boys in Liverpool could abduct, torture and kill an infant and leave his body on a railroad track.
But even the "God is dead" argument does not explain why a lonely black man would deliberately start shooting passengers on a commuter train in Long Island in early December just because they were white.
Explanations that make society's failings responsible for rising crime rates everywhere do not satisfy Alexander Schuller, a sociologist in Berlin who believes that something more fundamental, the darker side of human nature, is at work. "I believe like all theoreticians, theologians and students of human behavior that we carry evil within us and can commit evil," he told Der Spiegel magazine recently. "Differentiation between good and evil is a uniquely human trait, but good seems worn out. There's no reward in it anymore."
Some blame the media or the movies for the degeneration. Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York doesn't quite do that, but he wrote in The Los Angeles Times recently that "civility and sensibleness and feeling of community" had been "eclipsed by the dark images coming from the television screens."
Did we really desire so much violence, so much disgusting behavior, as we see on the programs Hollywood and television offer us? St. Paul might have said yes: "For the good that I would do, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do."
The age of unbelief is still groping for substitutes for religion and other traditional ways of keeping destructive human impulses under control. It is not clear whether it will find them.

HEADLINE: 20/20 Foresight Is Its Own Reward

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NINETEEN NINETY-THREE will long be remembered as the year we finally got rid of all the people without a vision thing, and replaced them with a fresh crop of forward thinkers. Fresh President; fresh Congress; fresh cast of poohbahs and icons, all brimming with fresh visions of the future. Don't stop thinking about tomorrow, don't stop, it'll soon be here, dah-dah-dah-dah and so on. How recent it all seems.
And now tomorrow is here, and by and large, the events of 1993 have vindicated that foresight. With one or two exceptions, but, then, who's counting?
 

There was Somalia:
"We will always provide the other side an opportunity to lay down their weapons. If they do not, they face dire consequences."
Maj. General Charles E. Wilhelm, in January.
"Others are fully able to take our place without any change in the effectiveness of the operations on the ground."
Robert W. Oakley, the special envoy to Somalia, in January as United Nations forces prepared to take over the bulk of relief operations from American troops.
"The military back of Aidid has been broken."
President Clinton, in June.
 
And Bosnia:
"This is an important moment for our nation's post-cold-war role in Europe and the world. . . . By acting now, we can demonstrate that not every crisis needs to become a choice between inaction and unilateral American intervention."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in February.
 
Of course, anyone is entitled to a change of heart:
"Frankly, we come into office and find a situation in Bosnia that has already deteriorated to a point where the solution is, is almost beyond the grasp of any human instrument."
Mr. Christopher, in April.
 
And Haiti:
"Mr. Chairman, I think the last few weeks have seen some significant progress in the situation in Haiti."
Mr. Christopher, in April.
 
And last month's parliamentary elections in Russia:
"I have every confidence in the outcome. Every time, the Russian people have chosen reform over retrenchment, hope over fear, the future over the past."
Mr. Christopher, in October.

 Well, look, it's impossible to predict what some foreigners will do next. Domestic issues, on the other hand, are genuine terra firma.
 
Presidential appointments, for example:
"The choice of Zoe Baird to be Attorney General is the most inspired stroke of Bill Clinton's Cabinet-making."
Anthony Lewis, the New York Times columnist, after Ms. Baird's selection was announced in late December.
"It's no big deal."
Senator Orrin Hatch in January, making light of Ms. Baird's failure to pay taxes on salaries paid her nanny and driver.

Federal spending?
"Of the $500 billion, two-thirds of that came out of spending, and one-third out of revenues. And I have to tell you that that's about the right formula if you want to put together a deficit reduction plan."
Budget Director Leon Panetta, eight months before Mr. Clinton claimed victory with passage of a one-to-one mix of tax hikes and spending cuts.
 
Forget Government, then. At least Hollywood still offered role models:

"I feel good about the movie's potential, really and truly good about its potential."
Sid Ganis, marketing president for Columbia Pictures, last summer before the box-office tallies came in on the year's most expensive dud, "Last Action Hero."
But some of us never went to the movies much anyway.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
It's Confounded Change Calling Again, Honey!

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT is rare when a legal case has a direct impact on almost everybody in the United States, and it is even more unusual when it unleashes a torrent of change that is still under way 10 years later.
On New Years' Day, Americans will mark the 10th anniversary of just such a moment: the breakup of Ma Bell's monolithic telephone system. At 12:01 A.M. on Jan. 1, 1984, the American Telephone & Telegraph Company fulfilled the terms of its antitrust settlement with the Justice Department and officially turned over its local telephone monopoly to seven new and independent "Baby Bell" companies. 
 Now, just when people have gotten used to one brave new world of competition, Congress and the Clinton Administration are gearing up to rewrite the rules of telecommunications once again. Paradoxically, one of the casualties of that effort would be the breakup decree itself -- not because it failed, but because it was overtaken by the very revolution it helped foster.
Last week, Vice President Al Gore outlined a broad plan that calls for eliminating the legal barriers that currently separate the telephone, cable TV and broadcasting industries into balkanized fiefs. In addition, Mr. Gore praised bills now pending in Congress that would relax key restrictions in the Ma Bell consent decree barring the seven Baby Bells from providing long-distance service or manufacturing equipment.
Why is government acting? Largely because in the new digital world, many boundaries erected to protect the public interest are now simply insulating companies from competition. Local telephone companies and cable TV companies, both monopolies created in part by regulators, are now racing toward a similar vision of the information superhighway. Both want to offer a huge selection of channels, movies on demand and two-way voice and data communications. Hence the frenzied mating attempt by phone companies to buy or invest in cable TV systems outside their territories. Yet a host of state and Federal regulations still limit the extent to which either side can raid the other's markets.
Meanwhile, competition is heating up on other fronts. A new generation of wireless phones could in time compete directly with ordinary phones. In a challenge to the Bells, A.T.&T. is planning to buy the nation's largest cellular company, McCaw Cellular Communications.
TV broadcasters, using new digital technology, could soon be able to transmit data as well as entertainment. Satellites beaming more than 100 TV channels directly to home antennas no bigger than a pizza will be competing against cable TV by this summer.
 
Big Deals
 Gargantuan corporate deals were the order of the year. Last week the bidding war for Paramount Communications (a war bankrolled in part by Baby Bells) seemed close to resolution when the board of the entertainment giant tentatively agreed to merge with the partner it had resisted for months, QVC Network Inc. In earlier megadeals, Bell Atlantic agreed to buy Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable TV operator, and British Telecom bought a 20 percent stake in MCI Communications, signaling a movement toward global alliances.
The accelerating free-for-all poses some of the same difficult issues that the A.T.&T. divestiture did. Under the Bell System, high long-distance prices subsidized inexpensive basic service. After the breakup, some of those costs had to be shifted back to local customers so A.T.&T. could compete in long distance. And so, life became more complicated for Americans, many of whom believed with some reason that they already had the best phone system in the world. Virtually overnight, customers found that they couldn't simply go to one company for phone service. They had to choose a long-distance company. They had to buy their own phone. If something went wrong, many ran into a maze figuring out who to get to fix the problem. Was it the line or the equipment?
But for all the headaches, the breakup fostered healthy change. Long-distance prices plunged as A.T.&T. lost ground to rivals like MCI and Sprint. Customers can now choose from many kinds of telephones, and businesses from many advanced communications systems.
The Bell breakup had even more far-reaching effects. It established an entirely new canon of communications policy: replacing regulation with competition to guard the public interest. The opening of the long-distance and telephone-equipment markets is now the model for thinking about every other line of business, from cable TV to cellular phones. In the decade since the breakup, the United States has moved rapidly toward a free-wheeling information economy linking independent networks that operate at blinding speed.
But while the future may bring wondrous technology, it could also prove leaner and meaner for some. Just as many Americans live in rundown areas neglected by banks and developers, a brash world of purely market-driven communications could leave many in technology ghettos where it seems unprofitable to run fiber optics or advanced switching.
Today, local phone companies use billions of dollars of internal subsidies to underwrite inexpensive service for millions of people, just as Ma Bell used high long-distance charges to keep local service cheap. Today's local companies admit that they charge highly inflated "access charges" to link long-distance carriers with their customers, thereby keeping prices of basic telephone service low. But new competitors are eager to enter this $25 billion market, and industry experts agree they can easily undercut current prices.
Policymakers are seeking ways to incorporate the public interest in telecommunications, but there are no easy answers. One idea is to broaden "universal service" -- the affordable minimum -- to include more than just phones. Under a House bill, companies competing in a local telephone market would contribute to a pool of money for universal service, and carriers serving customers at artificially low prices would be compensated from the fund.
How such complicated changes would work in practice is unclear, but it is safe to say that for some people, the second wave of competition could prove just as jarring as the original breakup. If customers are mystified over the difference between MCI's "Friends and Family" and Sprint's "Most" plans, imagine rival companies offering dueling packages of cable TV, wireless telephone and long-distance services. Would it be cheaper to get 40 channels of cable, long-distance service for 10 cents a minute and 10 free movies off the video server? Or would it make more sense to get 20 channel, 10 hours a month of wireless talk time and a high-speed data link to a national library? Choices like that could make people yearn anew for the boring simplicity of Ma Bell.

HEADLINE: Those People;
An Unfinished Portrait of the Poor

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
"IT'S yellow," she explained to the blinking, uncomprehending man. "It's a yellow-looking substance that's coming out of his ear."
The subject was ear wax. The setting was parents' night. And the ear belonged to Chinedu Ezeriki, a fifth-grader in a parochial school uniform who could no longer hear his lessons. 
 His father, a cabdriver from Nigeria, could hear, but scarcely understand, the teacher's English.
"Wax?" he wondered.
He peered through his own broken eyeglasses, copied the address of a public clinic and vowed to unclog the boy's ears.
This evening of earnest, mundane exchanges is one of the most appealing memories of a decade spent writing about the lives of the poor.
It occurred this spring at a crumbling Catholic school, two miles from the White House, where housekeepers and janitors, nursing aides and vendors nervously filed forth to receive the teacher's judgments.
Most were immigrants. Few were Catholic. Some needed their children to translate. All had to strain for the $1,500 tuition. But they seemed to believe they were buying a piece of the American prosperity.
Here was the face of the American poor -- striving, decent and proud.
 
A Lot of Theories
 Poor people wear other, less flattering faces, of course, and there are many theories about dealing with them. They are oppressed (Jesse Jackson), lazy (Ronald Reagan) and seduced by the welfare state (Charles Murray). They have too many babies, and they have them too soon (Daniel Patrick Moynihan). They need tax relief (Jack Kemp). They need our help (Bill Clinton). They need to help themselves (Bill Clinton, again).
Who are the poor, these 36,734,000 souls scattered across the American landscape? The Government answers quite precisely: people with income amounting to less than $14,279 for a family of four.
But the numbers don't begin to tell the stories, and the theories rarely capture the complexity of the lives. What's striking is the infinite shades of gray, the strange combinations of bad luck, bad choices and bad places that sculpture individual lives.
The picture of poverty is really a succession of disjointed images. Poverty is the blend of Lysol and body odor at a homeless shelter in Detroit. It's the bent spine of an 80-year-old farm worker on the edge of a dusty grape field in Delano, Calif.
It's the blare of television soap operas in a Chicago high rise, drowning out the squalls of the badly diapered baby on a linoleum floor. It's the shrieks of Ricardo Terry's friends in a St. Louis funeral home as the teen-aged murder victim is mourned.
Some poor people suffer from a lack of jobs and some from a lack of fathers. Some suffer from the color of their skin and some from the constraints on their imagination.
Trying to coax a resident of a New Orleans housing project into an interview, I once offered to take her to whichever of the city's fabled restaurants she desired. "Shoneys?" she exclaimed.
In Washington, a sullen young woman named Margaret Williams was dragging her toddler into a medical van. He was more than a year behind on his vaccination shots.
She had no job. She had no husband. She explained in disgust that she had had no time to hassle with the social workers and the Medicaid forms that would have given her son free care.
"They want you to run around, and do this or that for nothing," she said. In the meantime, her son had got rickets.
The talk of "American apartheid" had always seemed wildy hyperbolic, an annoying snippet of lefty cant, until I took a drive down South State Street in Chicago and disappeared into the desolate high-rises, a civilization of menace.
Downtown faded to memory and mirage, glass wonderboxes and a blue-green lake. Here, 35 blocks away, lives lay abandoned as far as the eye could see.
Since it's hard to imagine creating a world worse than Stateway Gardens, even if we tried, the mind takes a conspiratorial turn: maybe someone did try; perhaps this is what the power structure plotted.
Linda Baldwin lived there. She had four children and no husband, and she used to be on welfare. Now she was hustling off to work at 7:30 each morning.
It was an unremarkable activity, except for the math. Her $6-an-hour clerical job left her with $169 less each month than the welfare system would have provided. That meant she fell $7.75 behind for every day she worked. Why bother?
"I feel better about myself," she said. Then she added, "but I'm still living here."
A month before, the Chicago River had broken through a freight tunnel and flooded downtown basements with muck. The city recruited welfare mothers from public housing projects, at $10 an hour, to help shovel the slime. Ten dollars an hour! They donned yellow gloves and smiles and they walked home in the afternoon as if they'd won the lottery. They wanted all the muck they could get.
About a week later I was at a white beach club in Jacksonville, Fla., on the Fourth of July. A friend's relative tossed out a joke about black people and watermelons. It was banal and bizarre and prompted by absolutely nothing. Maybe someone with a quicker mind or a better heart would have shattered the peace with protest, embarrassed a friend, laid down a line. I squirmed, kept silent, colluded.
A few old friends were there, people who had seemed of average talent and ambition 15 years earlier when we were classmates at the city's prep school, people no more or less decent than the rest.
Just as the residents of Stateway Gardens inherit gangs and welfare checks, they had inherited bank vice presidencies and sprawling lawns. But they would not use the word "inherit." They, we, prefer the word "earn."
Intellectuals sometimes yearn for the moment when people stop making moral judgments about the poor. The issue is poverty, they argue, not morality. Few people cluck about the morality of the rich.
A fair observation, but the judgments seem here to stay. Most people say it, if only to themselves: Get a job! Go to school! Stop having babies!
 
Strikes Against Her
 The social workers in Indianola, Miss., say it aloud when they go to visit Betty Briggs. ("She's ignorant," her caseworker said.)
She had five children, a sixth-grade education, no job, few teeth, a crossed eye, and a boyfriend named T. L. Truitt who boasts of his opposition to birth control. Her five-month-old son, C. L., had just died.
The boyfriend said it was her own fault, for smoking and fighting while pregnant. "This girl can't think," he said.
Betty Briggs smiled passively through two visits, said little, shouldered the blame. Then shared her secret treasure: five dim Polaroids of her son's crib-sized coffin. "I feel like dying myself," she said.
Sometimes, Government anti-poverty programs seem so futile they make the stomach flutter. Riverside, Calif., runs the country's most acclaimed welfare training program.
Last spring, a dozen poor people filed into a conference room to hear a social worker fret. "Hopefully we can get you employed as soon as possible," she said. "I shouldn't say hopefully. I keep losing my train of thought."
Some of the women wore bored looks that suggested they had seen it before. A woman from Ethiopia wore a big turban on her head and understood no English.
A woman with a Spanish accent sobbed and protested that she was a "survivor" -- not a refugee, but a victim of domestic beatings, terrified that the welfare system would return her to her husband.
A woman in stretch pants raised a fleshy arm and voiced doubts about her own employability. "I went to a factory," she said. "They saw how fat I was and they said no."
 
'Reform' in Action
 Policies seldom play out the way politicians envision. Last year, Michigan decided it could strengthen the work ethic if it ended a welfare program for single adults it considers able-bodied.
It worked for Glenn Williams -- sort of. He started wandering through church basements, collecting free clothes and selling them to his neighbors in a seedy Detroit hotel -- $3 for a shirt, $5 for a pair of pants.
His whisper was barely audible beneath the blare of Christian radio. "From the blessings of God," he said, "everything come out beautiful."
Some Government programs work. Paramedics in Anchorage do an admirable job of keeping street alcoholics from freezing to death. One afternoon last year they found an unconscious man in an alley, face-down in the dirt, foaming at the mouth. He was flanked by an empty bottle and a pornographic magazine. They knew him by name.
"C'mon Frank, wake up," the medic said. "Party time's over."
Sometimes poor people disdain poor people. Jose Palacio, the night janitor at Penn Station in New York, does not like the homeless who live there.
They do not like him either. They mock his earnest, broom-pushing ways. He holds his nose and wipes the wastes they leave on the bathroom floor. "Those people live like animals," he said one night. "You can't help them."
Sometimes poverty twists the affluent. Robert Mangum was a landlord at Sugar Ditch, the notorious Tunica, Miss., slum. The shacks he owned had leaky roofs and perforated walls and emptied their waste into a canal a few yards away. He seemed angrier at his tenants than they were at him.
He noted they were "colored." He said "bugs have to do with personal hygiene." He said some of the tenants were on welfare, and people who "are 21 and healthy, I have no cares what they get."
I pictured him living in a big house with white columns. He knew it and he defiantly drove me home, to a big house with white columns. The halls were filled with medals from the Special Olympics. His son has Down syndrome. The anger and suspicion never left his voice, but the words changed: he lectured me on the special love a disabled child brings to a family.
When times get tough, as many as a million Americans a year go bankrupt. But others, like Bob and Amy Davis, aren't so lucky.
They were too poor to go bankrupt. They couldn't afford to pay the lawyer to file the papers to protect them from their creditors.
In a world of hard-luck stories, the one they told from a trailer park in Morganton, N. C., went beyond the bounds. They have three children. The children each have a rare genetic disease. The parents bought them bicycles for Christmas. The bicycles got repossessed -- probably by someone like their father.
Bob, an unemployed mechanic, needed work. He signed on as a repo man.
It was the holiday season. I offered each of the children a $5 bill. They turned it down. "Mister," said the 8-year-old ringleader, "you might need it for gas."
Bob foraged in his drawer and insistently offered a coupon from Kentucky Fried Chicken. He said the family couldn't afford to use it.
It offered about 99 cents off the three-piece dinner. I did the only decent thing I could think of. I put the coupon in my wallet, drove back toward the Interstate, and ate.

Will Success Spoil Kwanzaa?

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Today is the first day of Kwanzaa, a 27-year-old African-inspired harvest celebration in which many American blacks give thanks over a period of seven days. Each day a candle is lit and families share intimate feasts. Each day, families dedicate themselves to a different guiding principle.
One of these principles is ujaama, a Swahili word meaning cooperative economics. At last week's Kwanzaa Holiday Expo in New York City, ujaama was flourishing. Some 300 exhibitors paid $900 each to set up shop at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to sell African sculpture, Kwanzaa cards and wrapping paper, teddy bears in African garb and Kente pattern tablecloths. 
 But the event also revealed the increasing participation of major corporations, including Anheuser-Busch, Pepsi-Cola, Revlon, Hallmark, Chemical Bank, A.T.& T., Time-Life Books, Woolworth's and JCPenney.
With millions of blacks expected to observe Kwanzaa, the Expo's organizers calculate the national market for Kwanzaa products is as high as $100 million.
Does all this mean that Kwanzaa, with its goals of grace and intimacy, is being co-opted by larger economic forces and becoming as commercialized as Christmas?
Maulana Karenga, chairman of the black studies department at California State University at Long Beach, who developed the concept for the holiday in 1965, says American society is a culture eager to make the tenderest of sentiments ring bells at the cash register. "This is a capitalistic society where they rent wombs and sell bodies," Dr. Karenga said. "One can expect they will try to commodicize. The challenge for the African people is to avoid the problems of commercialization that they've learned from other holidays like Christmas."
 
Whose Gain?
 Dr. Karenga and others say the important thing is how Kwanzaa is used commercially and who profits. "There is no problem with commercializing it, but who will be the benefactors of the commercialization?" said Cedric McClester, who has developed an alternative to Santa Claus, an African storyteller named Nia Umoja whose gift-giving role is considerably smaller. "It should be people of African descent, not just corporate America."
"Black people need not be embarrassed about making money," said Bobbi Humphrey, a flutist who had a booth to sell her compact disks and a poster of one of her photographs. "That is what pays the rent and that is what makes America tick."
But the worry remains that consumers might be whipped into yet another consumerist frenzy. "I have friends who go kind of berserk," said Lagrane Brooks, who lives in East New York and strives to keep things simple for her family. "Some people are out there really, really crazy running up debts." DOUGLAS MARTIN

The Social Safety Net Most Russians Need is Cold Cash

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
AS the United States and the West scramble for responses to the electoral success of Russian extremists, building Russia "a social safety net" has become the cliche of the day.
If only Russians were better protected from the pain of economic reform, the argument goes, they wouldn't vote for neo-fascists and neo-Communists. So Russia should slow down reform and focus on social benefits now that there is no longer a Soviet-style guarantee of employment. This argument has found favor so far among figures as far-flung as Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin; Vice President Al Gore, and the deputy director of the International Monetary Fund, Ernesto Hernandez-Cata. 
 Never mind that this argument misreads the vote this month, which had to do with many other matters besides Government economic policy, including: instability, crime, corruption, social inequality, and the October shelling of the Russian parliament; splits among the reformers; unity among the extremists, and the reformers' miserable campaign. Nearly half of Russia's inexperienced voters were so alienated they didn't bother to vote.
And never mind that no Western nation has volunteered to grant an extra dollar for any new, improved social safety net, on the perfectly sound political theory that you cannot get away with paying for Russia's unemployed when you have so many of your own at home.
The real problem with the argument is that actual structural change of the Russian economy and its huge, ancient and distorted industrial sector -- which really will produce high unemployment -- has only barely begun, let alone cut down the work force with too sharp a sickle. The best estimates suggest that 5 million Russians are unemployed (officially, only 770,000 are), which represents about 5 or perhaps 6 percent of the work force -- good figures in European terms.
Most of the pain, anger and confusion felt by Russians (and by no means all of them) stems not from unemployment but from the steady impoverishment produced by high monthly inflation -- and this, most economists agree, has roots in too incoherent a policy and too little reform, not too much.
The biggest pain Russians feel stems from the low levels of their state-mandated salaries and pensions, which do not keep up with inflation and for weeks at a time are not paid at all. As state subsidies on items like bread and energy disappear, because the Government can no longer afford them, and as inflation rages because the Government is divided and the Central Bank seems incompetent, many Russians have become poorer than before. But it is not a "safety net" they crave; most of the angriest Russians are neither jobless nor pensioners.
 
Getting Ready Now
 If there is a reason to desire a stronger social safety net now, it is to prepare for what may happen if significant economic reform ever does happen in Russia. Such reform could indeed produce large numbers of the openly unemployed. That is, if the current Government, led by the industrialist Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, can be persuaded to stop subsidizing inefficient and essentially bankrupt enterprises. If it does that, it will have to help retrain workers, feed them for a time and provide new investment funds to enterprises willing to restructure.
That's not to say there aren't big problems with Russia's existing "social safety net," and the World Bank has already devoted much time to advising the Government how to improve it. Some officials of multilateral agencies say Russia's reformers have not been very interested in this problem, in part because unemployment has stayed low and in part because it would cost a lot when they are trying to cut spending.
One World Bank official said carefully: "For an aid program you need an interested partner, capable of developing and implementing projects." For instance, he said, a $70-million World Bank loan for the Russian Federal Employment Service, approved over a year ago, has still not been signed by Russia, so it could not be dispersed. Some Russian officials admit the charge is partly true, but they also say that year-old requests to multilateral agencies for funds to start small-business investment funds have yielded study groups, not money.
 
A Benefit Program
 Officially, Russians who have worked for 12 consecutive weeks and lose their jobs receive 75 percent of their average pay for the previous two months for 12 weeks; then 60 percent for the next four months; then 45 percent for the next year. Another 10 percent is provided for each dependent. Other Russians are entitled to the monthly minimum pay (currently $11.70) for a year. This program is funded in each region by a 2 percent payroll tax.
The problem is that inflation of some 20 percent a month reduces those benefits to minimum levels very quickly. World Bank officials say the 2 percent tax is much too low, and 90 percent of it is kept in each region. So the program is underfunded, and if one region has higher than average unemployment, its money will run out.
The World Bank has also pushed for a national program of social protection, so that anyone in real need can go somewhere for help -- an ultimate safety net, European-style. But the Russian Government has been leery of such a funding commitment. The Bank has helped Russia more clearly define its poverty line, and has pushed with success for fewer across-the-board subsidies, as on milk and bread, in order to use the money for the truly poor.
Pensions, given the inflation, remain a large source of pain. They are generally so low that pensioners keep working. This double-dipping makes the pension system much more expensive and ties up jobs. In another small but important reform, the Government has decided to compensate for inflation by increasing pensions by an absolute amount across the board, rather than through a percentage increase. This raises the lowest pensions the most.
Loans can help Russia lessen the pain. But for these loans to have real value, they have to be in the context of an economic stabilization program that really does cut inflation. "We can't just finance Russia's budget deficit," one official said. "The tendency is to say that stabilization has too high a price. But unless they stabilize, you can't have reform. Then what's the alternative?"

HEADLINE: The World;
Chile's Engine Revs Up With Free Trade's Fuel

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: CURICO, Chile

 BODY:
UNTIL recently this quaint farming community beside the Andean foothills was the picture of prosperity. Vast apple orchards lined its roads and teams of workers pruned, sprayed and irrigated the trees. Curico was a product of the economic miracle that had made Chile the Latin American tiger, a free-market, export-based economy often symbolized by its sales of fresh fruit to Europe and the United States during the Northern Hemisphere's winter.
But there is a disturbing new look to many orchards this year -- tall weeds among the trees, fences in ill-repair, irrigation ditches dry -- signs that apple production, like much of Chile's export sector, has hit hard times. 
 For the first time in more than a decade, Chile's exports have fallen in the past year because recession abroad has pushed down prices while a wave of consumerism at home has driven up production costs. In an earlier time, such world market gyrations would have set off calls for this or any other Latin American country to stem the exploitation of its natural resources by foreigners, to close its economy, and to develop small industries to make the nation more self-sufficient.
But now a different strategy is heard.
"Our trade problems only mean that we need to open the world economy even more," said Gonzalo Espinosa, a large producer of Chilean apples. "We need more free trade and more elimination of trade barriers."
Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley added: "The fruit producers are used to very high margins, making a lot of money, and those days are over. They've had problems with the quality of their products, their timing of getting the produce to market. And they have to fix those problems themselves."
Almost 40 years after the emergence of the so-called Dependency School in Latin America -- the theorists who argued that developing countries need to protect their resources from being ravaged by multinational corporations, the argument has been turned around. Now, having seen Mexico secure a place in the North American Free Trade Agreement, hopes are being pinned on the prospect of interdependence with the United States and other advanced industrial nations, through diversified and efficient economies that can compete in free trade.
In recent decades, the Latin nations found that they not only lacked human and financial capital to develop a multitude of local industries, but that their internal markets did not have enough demand to justify, for example, a home-grown automobile industry. Eventually, by the late 1980's, every attempt to gain independence from so-called industrialized neighbors had failed.
So the thinking began to turn toward increasing interdependence -- a notion that had its earliest manifestations in the privatizations of many Government-owned industries in countries like Argentina and Chile. Though foreign investors eagerly came in to buy large shares of these enterprises, they also sought out local partners and industrial groups for joint ventures.
Already, such joint ventures have brought a wealth of modern management strategies and technologies into Latin America.
 
Assurances Needed
 But a big hurdle remained -- guaranteeing broad access to markets in industrialized countries. Having opened its own markets to the industrialized world, Latin America needed assurance that the industrialized world would not shut out Latin products.
Enter the recently completed talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the passage of Nafta. These were major steps in assuring a continued open market, and the relief that was felt throughout Latin America was reflected in the relatively self-confident reaction to the drop in apple production here.
Chile is, after all, thought to be the South American country most likely to next join Nafta. And Chilean fruit producers say the GATT agreement will lower European tariff barriers to their products, one main reason for their weak sales this year.
Indeed, GATT and Nafta also now permit each country in Latin America to develop the industries in which they have a competitive advantage in labor costs, access to natural resources, or proximity to markets. This is only encouraging businessmen to think they can finally go beyond the exploitation of natural resources and apply more manufacturing processes to their products, such as persuading a foreign copper company mining ore to refine the ore in Chile itself, rather than export it for refining abroad.
"We now need to add value to our exports," said Roberto Fantuzzi, general manager of his family-owned aluminum fabricating business. "If I export an aluminum cooking pot, its value is three times the value of the metal. But if I export a piece of machinery, its value can be a thousand times the value of the metal. That means more higher-paying jobs in this country."
 
New Challenges
 Nevertheless, the process of creating higher-paying jobs is slow. Today, Chile's work force looks less attractive to foreign investors than, for example, Argentina's, because the level of education there is higher. So the Government will be challenged to invest more in schools -- as it also will have to invest in new or improved roads, bridges and ports, areas where there has been little real investment for more than a decade. In this, Chile may also fall behind Argentina, where the Government has privatized highway maintenance, railroad operation and port operation.
"For years we were far ahead of our Latin neighbors but they are now catching up on us," said Jose Pinera, a Harvard-trained economist, former Finance Minister under the military Government and a presidential candidate in the country's recent elections.
For now, and especially for fruit farmers, the focus is on cost-cutting and efficiency. Fernando Del Valle, an apple farmer, says he must constantly plant higher-yield trees of varieties tailored to market tastes. "To make money now," said Alessandro Bozzolo, general manager of the Copefrut fruit packing plant, "you have to produce more per acre and a lot more than before."

HEADLINE: Conversations: Milovan Djilas;
He Sees Ideologies Come and Go But the Balkans Remain the Same

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER

DATELINE: BELGRADE

 BODY:
THE living room is dominated by a huge painting of Faust, brooding at his desk as he ponders in Goethe's drama whether to be a man of action or remain a contemplative scholar.
The image is appropriate to the tempestuous life of its owner, Milovan Djilas, the rebellious Montenegrin who made a Faustian bargain with the Devil of Leninist ideology, trading a budding career as a writer for one as a Communist campaigner in 1930's Yugoslavia, emerging as a leader of Tito's wartime partisans, then, after victory, assailing the new tyranny he had helped create. 
 Mr. Djilas paid repeatedly for his nonconformism with 12 years behind bars -- first as a prisoner of the royal dictatorship, second and third as a prisoner of Marshal Tito's Communist dictatorship. In the early 1950's he had begun publishing articles attacking the new Communist bureaucracy, prompting his ouster from party and government posts. He soon became Communist Yugoslavia's most prominent dissident, prompting Tito to jail him again and again for works like "The New Class" and "Conversations With Stalin." His son Aleksa, who now lives next door in their apartment building near Parliament, has followed his father's dissident footsteps on his way to becoming a respected historian.
At 82, Mr. Djilas's contemplative phase, part of it in the confines of a cell, has lasted half his life.
Facing his Faust, he reflected on how imprisonment affects politically minded inmates. "It often hardens their will to power," he said, and cited some examples. "Stalin was sent to prison five times, Hitler for five years." He went on to Yugoslav leaders who had spent time in prison: Tito; Franjo Tudjman, the President of Croatia; Alija Izetbegovic, the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and others. "They wanted power," said Mr. Djilas. "I didn't want power. But prison transformed me, too. It transformed me from an ideologist into a humanist."
Reflecting on the 30 months of warfare that have torn apart the former Yugoslavia, Mr. Djilas said softly, "I see no way out."
With a touch of the fatalism endemic to the Balkans, Mr. Djilas spoke of the feckless efforts by the United States and other Western powers to persuade the warring ethnic leaders to make peace. "You didn't understand the Balkan mentality, to have power at any cost," he said. "They are fascists in the sense of nationalist racism, not of a fascist ideology as such."
 
'The War Will Last'
 "Balkan leaders," he said, "they know how to make a compromise, and then break it. The war will last more years."
The room on the second floor of the apartment house at No. 8 Palmoticeva Street was cold, like most others in Belgrade in a premature winter in which the international sanctions imposed upon Serbia have sharply reduced supplies of gas, oil and other fuels. An electric heater warmed his thin frame. He wore thick, red-and-black-checked woolen trousers and a windbreaker. Usually abstemious, he was sipping lozovac, a clear brandy, against the cold. "It is homemade," he said, grinning, "from Montenegro."
He is proud of his origins in the Black Mountains and has probably written more about his homeland than anyone since Njegos, the 19th century prince-archbishop, an outstanding epic poet of whom Mr. Djilas wrote a tender biography. Yet he cheerfully acknowledges that for all their colorful traditions "Montenegrins are basically Serbs."
Ideology has been a dominant theme of his life. Now, his youthful embrace of Communism long abandoned, he views ideologies with a mixture of pity and revulsion: "Khrushchev, Gorbachev, others, they all thought they could reform Communism. But that was always impossible. You cannot reform an ideology."
Noting that nationalism has replaced Communism as the main ideological currency in the Balkans, Mr. Djilas said he believed that the Slavic Muslims running the besieged government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo also fall into this category.
"You," he said, meaning Americans and other Westerners, "don't understand that Islam is a state ideology, to dominate in the name of a religion. It is very strong. Now the Bosnian Muslims are very determined in this." This was said without rancor.
Reminded that under President Clinton, the United States seemed to be shifting attention away from the West and toward the East, Mr. Djilas said: "The U.S.A. is right to turn to Asia. There the economy is growing. We in Europe are old and corrupt."
But he agreed to a suggestion about the origins of the American nation: "Yes, you are a European culture. You are the westernmost European people, while Russia is also a European culture, but eastern."
Mr. Djilas, who used to enjoy tramping the mountains and valleys of Montenegro and angling for trout, has been weakened by age and heart trouble. "When the elevator doesn't work I have difficulty getting up the stairs," he said. He has lost sight in his left eye and his hearing has diminished. "Intellectually I am all right," he said. "I'm still writing, a 500-page book with some new things, a collection, with other things American readers haven't yet seen."
 
'These Djilases'
 But he has been deeply affected by the loss of Stefica, his wife of 41 years, who died last summer of cancer. "I don't know if I can survive without her," he said, his eyes misting. "She was braver than I." As a young partisan fighter, Stefica Baric had distinguished herself in battle against the Wehrmacht.
Their son, Aleksa, 43, entered the living room, his wife of one month, Olgica, a university instructor in dentistry, on his arm. The author, in 1991, of the acclaimed study "The Contested Country: Yugoslav Unity and Communist Revolution, 1919-1953" has returned from the United States to be beside his father and to shoot an occasional flaming arrow into the murk of Serbian politics.
"I gave an interview in Borba," the son said, referring to the former Communist Party newspaper, "and a reader sent a letter saying he had had enough of these Djilases, that we should have salt poured on our tails." This drew a chuckle from his father, who had whole sacks of salt poured on him in his day.
"This is not the most glorious time for the Serbs," Aleksa said and, after assaying the various opponents of President Slobodan Milosevic, added: "Milosevic is the most skillful of them all. He cannot anticipate events, but he can read people."
The day was Nov. 29, still a holiday in truncated and no longer Communist Yugoslavia. It is sheepishly called Day of the Republic. But until 1990, when the ruling Communist Party collapsed, it was the Yugoslav National Day commemorating the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia, which in 1943, in defiance of the Nazi occupation, declared the creation of the new Yugoslavia of six federated republics.
Mr. Djilas noted that exactly 50 years ago, he and the rest of the Communist leaders had convened in the liberated Bosnian town of Jajce to proclaim a federal government and name Josip Broz Tito field marshal. The slogan then and until the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1991 was "Brotherhood and Unity."
"Not a bad slogan," said the elder Djilas.
The other slogan in 1943 was "Death to Fascism! Freedom to the People!"
"A very relevant slogan now," said the younger Djilas.

HEADLINE: Germans Find Unity May Mean Long-Term Change and Sacrifice

SERIES: Tarnished Dream: Germany After Unification -- First of two articles.

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUISBURG, Germany

 BODY:
More than three years after the initial euphoria over reunification, Germans are beginning to discover that they have to build a new country not only in the formerly Communist east, but also in the industrial west, requiring new ways of thinking and more sacrifice than they ever imagined.
Those in the west learned quickly that absorbing East Germany entailed more than enlarging and enriching the old Federal Republic of Germany. The new, united Germany is finding that the post-cold-war world is a more harshly competitive place than it was before. For many western Germans, the biggest shock is the discovery that the forces that made their country the richest welfare state in Europe and made its economy the Continent's most powerful can no longer guarantee the annual raises and increases in leisure time and the social security that they took for granted for decades.
 
Ruhr Steel in Crisis
 Nowhere is the shock more dramatic than here in the Ruhr, where recession and inexpensive imports have thrown the steel industry, long the core of the region's prosperity, into crisis. 
 In the Ruhr, whose sinews of coal and steel used to power the German industrial economy, some of the economic and social problems might have struck, as they did in the American "Rust Belt" a decade earlier, even if the Berlin wall had not fallen. Like other countries, Germany is affected by competition in high-quality manufacturing and technology from East Asia, but since 1989 it has suddenly had a highly trained, low-wage work force just across its own border, in Eastern Europe.
Just a few months ago, many workers at the giant Thyssen steel works in this port and manufacturing city in the west were sullen and resentful over the prospect of sacrificing living standards so their less fortunate counterparts in eastern Germany could improve theirs.
 
Refugees and Attacks Decline
 They worried about the influx of foreign asylum-seekers and a wave of rightist violence against foreigners. Last summer the rules for admitting foreign refugees were tightened, and their numbers have dropped, as have those of right-wing attacks.
Today, with more than 3.5 million Germans out of work and no sign that unemployment will decrease even when the recession ends, many workers here seem more worried about losing their jobs to global economic forces too complex for them to understand.
The anger is directed not so much against outsiders as against Chancellor Helmut Kohl. When hard times fell after the post-unification boom, he told voters that he was wrong in 1990 when he promised that no one would be worse off after the country came together. Now he has been telling Germans to tighten their belts and get used to lower wages and fewer welfare benefits if they want to keep jobs in Germany instead of losing them to more competitive countries.
"My advice to Kohl is to start slimming down himself before he starts asking the rest of us to," said Willi Geskes, 45, an electrician at the Thyssen plant. "The politicians should set an example of how to cut waste, instead of putting the whole burden on our shoulders."
 
Kohl Suffers in Polls
 After 11 years in power in Bonn, Mr. Kohl and his Christian Democrats have sunk to their lowest point in national public opinion polls since unification. With a string of local, state and regional elections set for next year and a national election coming in October, the Chancellor's position seems vulnerable as euphoria is replaced by harsh disillusionment.
In an interview with the daily Die Welt before Christmas, former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said he credited Mr. Kohl with "seizing the opportunity instinctively." "But," Mr. Kohl's predecessor said, "I also believe that the way unification was then carried out was to some extent catastrophically wrong."
The brief boom was followed by a recession that was only partly a result of the worldwide economic slowdown that began in the United States much earlier.
In eastern Germany, unification did not mean the instant prosperity that many expected. In fact, it appears that it will take at least a decade to make living standards in the east equal to those in the west.
 
Deficits Are Blamed
 Mr. Schmidt and others blame the severity of the loss of economic confidence in Germany on the fact that state, local and federal governments financed the reconstruction of the east's dilapidated infrastructure with budget deficits totaling between 7 and 7.5 percent of the gross national product this year, a postwar record, according to the Bundesbank. The independent central bank had to slam the brakes on money-supply growth by raising interest rates, and business growth plummeted.
Nationwide, unemployment has now risen to about 10 percent of the labor force. It is hard to tell precisely, because even three years after unification the Government keeps separate statistics for east and west.
German labor costs make it difficult to create jobs as fast as they are being lost. Many German companies have moved assembly lines to the Czech Republic because hourly wages and fringe benefits there are a 10th of what they are here.
For years, German industrial workers have been among the best paid in the Western world, with hourly wages nearly double those of American workers.
Workers in France and in Belgium have waged bitter strikes and angry demonstrations in fierce resistance to the notion that their living standards may have to suffer in the short run to assure them of jobs over the longer term. German workers do not like it either, but for the first time since World War II, they accepted pay cuts this year to save jobs.
 
Lost Jobs
Layoffs Increase While Wages Fall
 Here in the Ruhr, the traditional Christmas markets dispensed mulled wine, cookies and tree ornaments in the pedestrian zones of Duisburg and most other cities, but the stores filled with luxury goods began cutting prices in late November.
The Thyssen plant here plans to lay off 10,000 workers over the next year, on top of tens of thousands more it has let go since 1989. Rolf Bulck, 57, said his colleagues would probably be prepared to accept a wage settlement this year that might leave them with a net loss of income after 3.5 to 4 percent inflation. That, he said, was better than no jobs at all.
His union, the Metalworkers, began the bargaining by asking companies staggering under the impact of recession and cheap imports from Eastern Europe and other low-wage areas for wage increases over the next year of 5.5 percent, plus unspecified "job security measures." Few, including Mr. Bulck, expect to get it.
"What you see in the faces of young workers and trainees nowadays is fear," said Thomas Kennel, a union official. "People are afraid of losing jobs."
In the Ruhr, workers are feeling many of the same economic pressures that shattered the Communist industrial economy in the east.
There, the sudden transition from a planned economy to a free market based on the German mark made many overstaffed enterprises and factories bankrupt overnight. Here, the advent of increased competition has suddenly made generous German fringe benefits, wage levels and vacation entitlements uncompetitive.
"Because of the processes that led to reunification and the fall of the iron curtain, steel has been coming into Germany from eastern Europe, where labor costs producers only a 10th of what it costs steel companies here," said Friedrich Noth, deputy chief of the labor consultative council at the Thyssen plant.
Coal from the Ruhr has also been in decline for decades, because mining it deep underground is uncompetitive against cheaper coal from open pits in Poland or the United States, a fact that does not prevent the German Government from sinking more than $3 billion in subsidies into it every year to insure supplies to electricity plants and protect the few jobs that are left. The money, the equivalent of about a quarter of all German Government expenditure on research and technology, is raised by a special 7.5 percent tax on electricity bills that will rise to 8.5 percent next year.
Even so, coal-mining jobs are steadily disappearing. Ten years ago, there were more than 130,000 coal miners in the Ruhr, more than there are in all of western Germany now. Today fewer than 90,000 still earn their living underground.
Earlier, coal mines and labor unions made the reductions as painless as possible, reducing employment by about 5,000 people a year by attrition and early retirement. But now, miners face the possibility of joblessness for the first time in Germany's postwar history.
To avoid it, the Mining and Energy Union and mine owners agreed on a four-day week for the coming year that would reduce miners' take-home pay by about 10 percent. Workers and management at the giant Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg accepted a similar agreement in November to prevent the loss of 30,000 jobs.
But few officials see the shorter work week as anything but a temporary solution to a long-term problem. Coal mining will never be profitable here without Government subsidies, but the Government parties in Bonn are thinking of cutting them back after the year 2000, a step that would mean layoffs for thousands.
"We believe national security alone justifies keeping the bargain, which is a Government promise anyway," said Christoph Meer, a spokesman for the coal miners' union in Bochum. "How do we know the Russians will keep delivering gas reliably forever?"
 
Cutbacks
Subsidies in East, Sacrifices in West
 For the next 10 years, the Government estimates, west Germans will have to pay about $100 billion a year to subsidize the rebuilding of roads, railroads, communications networks and real property in the east. Starting in 1995, some of this will be financed by a 5 percent income tax surcharge in the western part of the country.
A Government report on economic conditions issued this autumn concluded that national priorities need to be reordered. "In essence, Germans have been living beyond their means for some years, because demands have risen faster than economic productivity," it said. "It would be wrong to blame errors that have developed over the long term -- in part, over decades -- on German unity."
But many taxpayers at the lower end of the scale feel that they are being asked to sacrifice more heavily than the rich. To reduce the deficit, for instance, the federal Government will cut unemployment payments by between 1 and 3 percent, to 53 percent of the last net monthly paycheck for childless workers, as of Jan. 1. Over the next two years, welfare payments will increase by only 2 percent, less than the rate of inflation.
A parliamentary majority also approved a plan to eliminate payments to construction workers to replace wages lost when the weather is bad, a move that brought tens of thousands to the streets of Bonn in protest in October. Legislators later agreed to delay the end of this subsidy until 1995.
In all, Bonn slashed $12.4 billion from the federal budget with steps like these, which the opposition says hit the poor harder than the rich.
[Mr. Kohl said a few days before Christmas that more deep cuts would have to be made next year, apparently on the same order of magnitude.]
In Duisburg, where officials say unemployment exceeds 14 percent, Government spending cuts will mean additional welfare costs of $23.5 million, Norbert Giersch, the city manager, said. It also means that Duisburg will have to close two indoor swimming pools and four branch libraries, and save $58.8 million.
"In principle," he said, "we accept the need for the cuts, because it's better to help people to stay where they are than cause a mass migration out of the east."
But with the Government still spending millions of dollars to construct buildings for official offices in Bonn, even though the capital will move to Berlin by the end of the decade, many taxpayers are growing restive.
"I am not bothered by paying a 'solidarity surcharge,' " said Mr. Geskes at the steelworks. "What bothers me is all the waste."
The Government says the contracts had been settled before unification and would be too expensive to cancel, and it hopes to find some other use for the buildings.
 
Resentment
Some Are Getting 'Nothing at All'
 Among younger workers, some resentment of eastern Germans continues to simmer. Many in the area come from families that have lived here for generations, with few of the emotional or family ties to people in the east that made many Germans grateful for an end to the artificial divisions that kept them apart for 28 years. Others are "guest workers" who came to West Germany in earlier prosperous years and feel no emotional sympathy for the east.
"I wish we could have the same promises made to us that Kohl has given to the people in the east, but we get nothing at all," said Ismail Gurel, 26, a German steelworker born in Turkey who represents younger plant workers on the Thyssen labor-management board.
The company has a spanking-clean professional training plant here, the kind of place that President Clinton has spoken of as a model for the United States. It used to be a model for German companies as well, with its modern equipment and computer data processing training for every apprentice. But next year, because of the steel crisis, Thyssen will take on only 32 apprentices, compared with 260 a few years ago. Like other companies here, it is unable to offer most apprentices jobs after they finish their training.
"I'll finish my training next September," said Achim Forster, 18, who started learning the trade of machine-tool mechanic two years ago. "There were plenty of jobs then," he said, "but now after I finish, they'll probably hire me for three months and then I'll have to look for work at the employment office. Maybe I'll go into the army. I'll have to see what happens."
But some young people are more forceful in their frustration. In November, demonstrators bricked in the front door to the Duisburg office of Mr. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party. "Block our future and we'll block you in," said the slogan they left behind.

HEADLINE: INTELLIGENCE STUDY SAYS NORTH KOREA HAS NUCLEAR BOMB

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG with MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
The Central Intelligence Agency has told President Clinton that North Korea probably has developed one or two nuclear bombs, according to Administration officials.
The classified assessment -- supported by virtually all intelligence agencies but disputed by the State Department's analysts -- deepens the Administration's dilemma as it tries to fulfill Mr. Clinton's pledge that "North Korea cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb." 
 If confirmed, North Korea's nuclear status would have significant implications for Asian stability. Many American officials fear that it would touch off an arms race in the region and push Japan to develop atomic weapons.
 
A 'Worst Case' Scenario?
 Some officials contend that the Administration is playing down the recently completed intelligence study because it calls into question the effectiveness of its diplomatic efforts to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.
But other senior Clinton Administration policy makers question the assertions, arguing they represent a "worst case" analysis that is based not on conclusive proof but on estimates about the amount of plutonium the North Koreans could have produced and assessments on the pace of their program.
"What the intelligence community is saying is that the horse is already out of the barn," one official said. "It's too late."
Asked about the new assessment, Clinton Administration officials said they were still determined to pursue diplomacy to prevent North Korea from producing more plutonium for nuclear weapons, or, if the study proves correct, to force the country to relinquish its bombs.
 
Not an Attractive Option
 Pentagon officials have said the option of a preemptive strike against North Korea's nuclear installations is not an attractive one, because it would risk a war and American intelligence does not know where Pyongyang has hidden its plutonium or bombs.
The comprehensive review of Pyongyang's nuclear program represents the collective judgment of American intelligence agencies and was presented to Mr. Clinton and senior White House officials in recent weeks. Defense Secretary Les Aspin and Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, have alluded to the report's conclusions but have couched their remarks with more ambiguity than those of the document itself.
The document, called a National Intelligence Estimate, says there is a "better than even" chance that North Korea already has a nuclear bomb and holds out little hope that the Clinton Administration can derail the reclusive North Korean Government's nuclear program. It argues that diplomatic efforts or economic sanctions, a next step contemplated by some officials, are unlikely to succeed. The study said sanctions could even prompt an attack by the North Koreans against the South.
Most of the intelligence analysts agree that North Korea is investing significant amounts of its scarce cash in a program to obtain plutonium, develop the high-explosive trigger needed for a nuclear detonation and build a medium-range missile that can reach Japan.
The study estimates that North Korean could have extracted as much as 12 kilograms of plutonium, about 26 pounds, which would be enough under optimum conditions for two bombs.
 
No Satellite Picture For Confirmation
 American officials also said they have detected craters near North Korea's nuclear site at Yongbyon that are consistent with experiments with conventional munitions needed to detonate a nuclear bomb.
Still, American intelligence does not have a specific satellite picture, electronic intercept or agent's report that confirms deployment of a weapon.
The judgment that North Korea probably has a nuclear bomb is supported by almost every intelligence agency, including the C.I.A., the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and also the Energy Department. Only the State Department's intelligence arm, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, disputes the conclusion, arguing that the data are not persuasive.
Several officials said the disagreement over North Korea's nuclear abilities turns not only on an analysis of its scientific prowess but also on a fundamental dispute over the intentions of the Government. C.I.A. analysts tend to see Pyongyang's leaders as despots who have turned to nuclear weapons to insure their hold on power. Analysts at the State Department assert there are splits within North Korea's ruling elite, and they say moderates should be encouraged through a combination of incentives and punishments.
The new intelligence assessment has important implications for efforts by the Clinton Administration to persuade North Korea to open its nuclear sites to international inspectors and abandon its nuclear program.
Those negotiations have recently showed signs of progress.
Administration officials have said, for example, that there has been progress in persuading the North Koreans to open all seven of its officially disclosed nuclear sites to international monitors. But they caution that important details need to be worked out, and there is no agreement on the separate question of whether inspectors can visit two waste dumps to see how much plutonium the North Koreans might have produced.
 
Problems Created For South Koreans
 American officials said that if President Clinton accepts the intelligence report as true, the diplomacy aimed at trading broader diplomatic and economic ties for nuclear concessions would be considerably complicated. If Mr. Clinton concurs, the United States would be seeking not only to end North Korea's nuclear program but to force it to relinquish bombs it has already completed and hidden away.
"Ultimately, the President will have to make a decision on the basis of the evidence," said a senior Administration official. The study's findings raise problems for South Korea, which has been urging a negotiated solution. "Having one or two bombs would create a very serious issue for us," said a senior South Korean diplomat in Seoul.
Present and former intelligence officials say that monitoring North Korea's nuclear program has always been one of their most vexing problems. North Korea builds much of its military-industrial base underground, and engages in extensive efforts to deceive the prying eyes and ears of American satellites. North Korea's fearsome security apparatus also makes it difficult to gather even routine information about the Government's and intentions.
Nonetheless, Western intelligence officials have grown increasingly concerned about North Korea's progress toward a bomb in recent years. Robert M. Gates, the Bush Administration's Director of Central Intelligence, told Congress in February 1992 that North Korea could have a bomb from within a few months to a couple of years. The main focus of concern is the nuclear site at Yongbyon, about 60 miles North of the capital, Pyongyang. It includes a reactor fueled by uranium mined from North Korea. The reactor is similar in design to those used in the 1950's by the Soviet Union and United States to produce plutonium for nuclear bombs. Nearby is a building in which the North Koreans separate plutonium from fuel rods removed from the reactor.
 
Plutonium Amount Is Crucial Question
 After operating the reactor for several years, the North Koreans in 1989 shut it down for about 100 days. During this time, the fuel rods were removed and plutonium extracted. North Korea acknowledges that it refined some plutonium, but insists the amounts were trivial.
North Korea signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1985, but it declined until last year to permit inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to look at the nuclear sites it has officially disclosed to the agency. When the agency analyzed samples of North Korea's plutonium, it concluded that Pyongyang scientists had engaged in more extensive reprocessing than they had acknowledged.
The question became: How much more?
In the recent intelligence study, most of the analysts assume that the North Koreans were able to reprocess enough plutonium for one to two bombs. One Administration expert said a relatively inexperienced nuclear nation would need at least about 12 pounds for a bomb.
The State Department challenged this estimate, arguing that North Korea's poor equipment for extracting fuel rods was likely to limit the amount of plutonium that could be produced to less than the amount needed for a single bomb.
Previous intelligence failures by all parties are casting a shadow over the debate. Some State Department and Pentagon officials believe intelligence analysts have put forward "worst case" conclusions so they cannot be accused of failing, as they did in the case of Iraq, to sound sufficient warning about a nuclear program.
"In the face of a very high level of ignorance, nobody wants to repeat the experience of Iraq," said one Administration official.
 
Agency Misjudged Ability of the North
 On the other hand, intelligence experts assert that the State Department has consistently underestimated North Korea's abilities. Analysts in the Department, for example, for years disputed the notion that North Korea had a reprocessing plant for plutonium, accepting North Korea's assertion that the giant building at Yongbyon was a textile factory.
Even as the United States tries to head off the program centered around the Yongbyon reactor, American officials are worried by the possibility that the North Koreans could expand their production of plutonium. Shutting down the reactor a second time, which Pyongyang said earlier this year it wanted to do and which may happen in the next several months, would enable the North Koreans to reprocess as much as 12 additional kilograms of plutonium, enough for perhaps two bombs.
Officials are also raising questions about a second, significantly larger North Korean reactor scheduled to be completed in 1995. An Administration official said that each load of spent fuel from a reactor of this size could produce 10 times as much plutonium as the Yongbyon reactor -- about 265 pounds.
If the North Koreans chose to, they could use this reactor to produce bombs that could be traded for oil to a country like Iran. American officials say that North Korea has for years been exporting its short-range Scud missiles or components to the Middle East, including to Syria and Iran.
North Korea is also developing the Rodong 1, a surface-to-surface missile with an estimated range of 620 miles. It is unclear to American analysts whether the North Koreans could develop a nuclear weapon small enough to fit on a missile. American analysts note that a crude bomb can be delivered by airplane, but the circumference of the Rodong is relatively small, requiring fairly considerable technical sophistication on the part of the weapons designers.
"We don't know everything about this program," one Administration said. "We only know what we can see, and those parts are disturbing enough."

Korea Sees 'Positive Signs'
 TOKYO, Dec. 25 (Reuters) -- The President of North Korea, Kim Il Sung, said today that there had been "positive signs" in his country's talks with the United States over inspections at suspected nuclear-related facilities.
But he told the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is visiting Pyongyang to help defuse the crisis, that there was no need for United Nations involvement.

HEADLINE: Columbus Divides Ohio's Capital City

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The winter wind is blowing hard and mean, the Ku Klux Klan wants a permit to demonstrate downtown and the city's beloved Ohio State Buckeyes are headed for one of those second-tier bowl games that no one really cares about.
So, maybe it is a good thing that the people of Columbus have something else to fuss over these days: should a 500-ton statue of Christopher Columbus that is 6 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty be put near the banks of the Scioto River, not far from the full-size replica of the Santa Maria and the other monuments already dedicated to the man and the myth? 
 The 311-foot statue, nicknamed Chris Kong, was built by a prominent sculptor in Moscow, Zurab K. Tsereteli, as a token of friendship between Russia and the United States. But, he says, he has not yet managed to give it away to the people of America. Several cities and citizen's groups in Florida turned him down even after a Dade County businessman spent $500,000 trying to persuade his neighbors that the monument would be good for pride and profit.
Now, a group of citizens here wants to bring the bronze statue to this heartland city, the largest in the country named after Christopher Columbus. If it ever arrives, it will close a chapter in an international episode of unrequited love, politics, art and money with a cast that includes two fallen world leaders, fasting demonstrators and a blind masseuse with a vision.
 
No One Willing to Spend
 The Mayor, Greg Lashutka, says his city has other pressing needs and will not spend a penny on the project. Mr. Tsereteli says he does not want any payment for his work -- only the merchandising and licensing rights. But shipping and assembling the statue in Columbus would cost close to $25 million. The Governor of Ohio, George V. Voinovich, likes the statue but also says no state money is available. That leaves the citizens' group, including a winery owner, Christopher Columbus buffs, an investment banker and the civic-minded masseuse, Karen Hadley, to try to raise the money for the statue.
Ms. Hadley heard about the statue last winter and told everyone she knew what a great tourist attraction it would be with, maybe, a restaurant and gift shop to go along.
"Karen has more vision than most people with 20/20 eyesight," said Jane Butler, the president of the citizens' group, the New World Monument Foundation. "She was able to see into the future."
 
Help for Skyline
 For the group, the statue is a chance to put the city and its skyline on the map. The statue would be only three stories shorter than the city's tallest building, the 34-story state office tower, and, group members insist, it would rival Seattle's Space Needle, the Arch in St. Louis, the Eiffel Tower and, of course, the Statue of Liberty.
"A statue like this comes along once every 100 years," said Ralph Frasca, a member of the group. "Now, we're going to be known for football and the statue. If we ever win the Rose Bowl, we'll put a big Buckeye T-shirt on it."
But for others here, the idea of Chris Kong looming over the city is a disgrace, a blow to American Indians and a sure bet to put Columbus near the top of Jay Leno's monologue for the next 365 nights.
Mark Welsh of the Native American Indian Center in Columbus said he was circulating a petition to stop the statue. In October, during the city's Christopher Columbus Day celebrations, American Indians, along with others, fasted and protested for more than a week.
 
A Laughing Matter
 "To the Native American people, Christopher Columbus represents 500 years of genocide," Mr. Welsh said. "Plus, the statue is ugly and the whole country will be laughing at us if we put that thing up. It's a very insensitive idea."
Max Goldberg, the former president of the group that tried to bring the monument to south Florida and who is now advising the group in central Ohio, said Mr. Tsereteli had no idea when building the statue what a disputed figure Christopher Columbus had become in the United States.
To Mr. Tsereteli, Christopher Columbus was still the heroic adventurer of old grade-school history books that barely mention the slaughter and the sorrow of American Indians, Mr. Goldberg said. All the artist wanted to do was symbolize and support the newly discovered friendship between his country and the United States. And maybe make a few bucks.
"The name of the statue in Russian is New World," Mr. Goldberg said. "He had no idea that Christopher Columbus was politically incorrect by today's standards."
 
Likes Big Art
 So, Mr. Tsereteli began to build and build. He likes to make big art and the monument is his biggest piece yet. One of his works, "Good Defeats Evil," a statue of St. George slaying dragons made from defanged missiles, soars 40 feet in the air at the United Nations in New York.
While building the Columbus monument in the late 1980's, the artist had the support of several Republics and the Mayor of Moscow because his foundries, which once turned out bigger-than-life statues of Lenin and Pushkin, kept people working. Mr. Tsereteli is a member of the presidium of the Russian Academy of Arts.
"The governments made materials and manpower available to him," Mr. Goldberg said. "The Mayor of Moscow is the chairman of the Columbus Committee of Russia."
The statue has been completed and its 14-foot-tall head is in a warehouse in Florida. It was shipped there in the unsuccessful effort to find American money and support for the project. Another 1,500 pieces are in storage in St. Petersburg, waiting for a home.
 
High-Level Agreement
 In the last days of the cold war, it looked like the wait would not be long.
One day in Moscow in 1991, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of Russia and President George Bush quietly reached an agreement. It had nothing to do with nuclear weapons or troop reductions or economic assistance.
During a tour of Mr. Tsereteli's studio, the two world leaders were asked which of two versions of the statue they preferred. The two men, each of whom would soon be thrown out of office, agreed that they liked the model showing Columbus at the wheel of his ship, with three flags snapping in the wind behind him. The base of the ship turns into a map of the New World and Columbus has his hand raised above his head, in a greeting or, according to some, a signal that the conquest and destruction of the Indians was about to begin.
Wilma Roberts, a 51-year-old Navajo, was signing people in for free Christmas lunches and toys from the Native American Indian Center here when she stopped to talk about the statue.
 
'I'll Protest. I'll Picket'
 "It looks to me like they're trying to make Christopher Columbus into a God," she said. "He was a thief, a rapist and a murderer. I guess the people of Russia don't have the slightest idea what happened to us. I'll protest. I'll picket. If they dig a hole, I'll jump in it. I'll do whatever it takes to stop it."
To offset such hard feelings, the statue supporters say they also plan to build a cultural center to display the contributions and triumphs of all the people of the New World.
"I don't look at it as a monument to Christopher Columbus," Mrs. Butler said. "It is a symbol of discovery and exploration."
The statue supporters say more than 300,000 people will visit the monument every year, bringing their wallets and pocketbooks with them.
Others disagree. "I think it's going to be pretty abominable," said Wes Blizzard, a high school art teacher in Columbus. "No one is going to pay money to see it. You can see the thing from miles away. And we've already got a Christopher Columbus statue. We don't need another one."
That statue stands under the sky and the pigeons in front of the Columbus City Hall, not far from where the Klan hopes to demonstrate.
It was a gift nearly 40 years ago from Genoa, Italy, as a testimonial of the values and virtues Christopher Columbus "entrusted to the human conscience."
The Columbus Mayor at the time, M. E. Sensenbrenner, said, "We shall ever cherish and be guided by its meaning."
It was dedicated, according to a plaque, on Oct. 12, 1955, "before 100,000 grateful Americans."

HEADLINE: AMTRAK PRESSING FOR CAPITAL FUNDS

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Although Amtrak is approaching self-sufficiency in its operating budget, the Government-owned railroad needs a substantial infusion of Federal money to replace dilapidated equipment and property, Federal and Amtrak officials say.
Fares paid 80 percent of the railroad's operating costs in 1993, continuing a steady increase from the 48 percent they contributed in 1981. The officials say the railroad could be self-sufficient in the next decade. 
 But they also say the railroad needs nearly $4 billion in Federal money to repair and replace its aging trains, dilapidated stations and inadequate maintenance yards. Without this money, experts say, Amtrak will have to curtail routes and service.
 
Declining Subsidies
 The Government's current $351 million operating subsidy to Amtrak augments passenger revenues of nearly $1 billion. The subsidy has fallen over the years from $720 million in 1981 as more passengers have traveled farther and as costs have been reduced through increased efficiency.
The Clinton Administration's current budget provides another $200 million for Amtrak's capital improvements, and railroad officials expect about the same amount next year.
But Amtrak's manager of capital investment, Bijay Pandit, said the railroad would need $3.9 billion for capital improvements in the next five years, including $2 billion for new cars -- more than half of its cars are more than 40 years old and some are 45 -- $917 million for maintenance, and about $1 billion for new maintenance yards, stations and reservation and information systems.
 
Invest or Perish
 Thomas M. Downs, who took office as Amtrak's president this month, said in an interview that the railroad's future depended on modernization. "You have to invest in the capital plant, or this railroad will simply die as we know it," he said. "We've delivered a more cost-effective railroad in the short term by not funding our capital plant."
Competition from the airlines also provided a strong incentive for modernization, he said. "Airlines can provide transportation cheaper that we can in a lot of corridors," Mr. Downs said. "So it can't be pricing that gets us out of this. It's got to be productivity, and a substantial portion of that comes from better capital investment."
Although the Clinton Administration is expected to continue to provide operating subsidies, the availability of capital funds is unclear. Morton Downey, Deputy Secretary of Transportation, acknowledged in an interview that "the present level of capital investment is not enough to keep the railroad going."
 
Difficult Choices
 Congress will consider Amtrak's financial needs next year and has asked the General Accounting Office, the research arm of Congress, to make a comprehensive study of the railroad. Kenneth M. Mead, the G.A.O.'s director of transportation, said, "If Amtrak's financial situation doesn't improve, they're going to have to cut back either routes or frequency of service outside the northeast corridor."
Amtrak has gradually wooed two million more passengers since 1981, for a total of 21 million this year, and reported an increase in longer, more profitable trips. It has also cut operating costs, largely by negotiating new labor agreements that gave managers more flexibility in assigning workers.
William L. Gallagher, Amtrak's senior director of route planning and strategy, said, "As the economy improves and new equipment is delivered, we expect that passenger revenues will increase substantially and allow us to continue our increase in the revenue-cost ratio."
Amtrak has ordered 195 regular coaches and 50 sleepers. "If you take away the antiquated equipment, some long hauls can be pushed into profitability," Mr. Gallagher said.
Only two routes have shown a clear profit: the Auto Train between Lorton, Va., near Washington, and Sanford, Fla., near Orlando, which made $5 million last year, and trains between Boston and Newport News, Va., which made $1.4 million. Amtrak leases the tracks to Newport News, which reduces overhead costs.
 
A Costly Success
 The northeast corridor, between Washington and Boston, turned a $128 million profit on its day-to-day operations last year, but lost money overall because of overhead costs, though Amtrak officials still consider it a success. The corridor had 10 million passengers last year, nearly half Amtrak's total, and provided $347 million in passenger revenues, about 35 percent of the total.
Long-distance runs, like the Sunset Limited between Los Angeles and Miami, accounted for 28 percent of Amtrak's passengers and $481 million in passenger revenue, nearly half the railroad's total. But these routes of more than 600 miles, including Chicago-Seattle and New York-Florida, lost a total of $152.5 million in 1992.
The remaining 20 percent of Amtrak's passengers were divided between short-distance services, which collected $63 million in passenger fares but lost $23 million in 1992, and state-supported services, which lost $10.6 million. Short-distance services are routes of less than 600 miles, like New York-Albany and Chicago-St. Louis. State-supported services are trains that Amtrak only runs at the request of state governments, like the route between Chicago and Springfield, Ill.
"Amtrak has been a shoestring operation," Mr. Mead said. "If Amtrak is going to keep operating all the routes it's been operating, it's going to need capital."

HEADLINE: U.S. Denies Request for $3 Million to Fight TB

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
The United States cannot provide new funds requested by the World Health Organization to fight tuberculosis, says an official with the United States Agency for International Development.
The organization, which is part of the United Nations, had asked Washington to finance a third of a $9 million program to fight the deadly lung disease in developing countries and to thwart the mutation of the TB bacterium into drug-resistant strains. 
 "In the budget environment that we're looking at, it is a lot of money," the official, Dr. Ann Van Dusen, the United States agency's global health chief, said on Thursday. "It's funding we just don't have."
Urging that the United States agency approve $3 million for the United Nations program, Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, warned in a letter last week that "apathy courts a public health disaster."
But Dr. Van Dusen said her agency's health funds had already been committed to AIDS, child health and family planning programs. Moreover, the United States agency has cut other programs, including tropical disease and malaria vaccine research.
The United Nations organization contends that spending to fight tuberculosis, which kills three million people a year, more than all other infectious diseases combined, should be a high priority. The organization says $13 is enough to cure a tuberculosis patient in many countries.
"It is a logical, simple, cheap thing for America to do to bring a halt to what otherwise will be an incurable plague in the 21st century," said Richard Bumgarner, deputy director of the organization's tuberculosis program.
About one-third of the world's population is infected with tuberculosis, and eight million people get sick every year. Doctors hoped to eradicate TB in the United States by 2010, but cases instead have jumped 20 percent since 1985. And drug-resistant strains are rising rapidly.
The World Health Organization asserted last month that the United States and other countries were failing to fight TB. The world gave $16 million in tuberculosis aid to developing countries in 1990, when the disease killed 1.9 million people, but found $77 million for leprosy, which killed 2,000.
Mr. Bumgarner said the organization's project would provide developing countries with new drugs and training in TB treatments that work in half the time of the old yearlong therapy. Shorter therapy means patients have less time to spread TB.
Without American aid, "there's really no hope to do what we need to do," he Mr. Bumgarner said. He said he would reapply.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Moves on 'Privatization' Pledge

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Even before he becomes Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani has started to lay the groundwork for turning over some New York City agencies and their functions to private companies, indicating that he will move quickly on his pledges to improve services and shrink government through "privatization."
Mr. Giuliani and his aides announced last week that they had already begun drafting a proposal to shift control of as many as three of the city's 11 municipal hospitals -- probably those most ailing -- to private, nonprofit corporations. 
 Mr. Giuliani also met this week with executives of the New York Racing Association and asked them, in effect, to make an offer for the city's Offtrack Betting Corporation, which Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly derided as "the only bookie in New York City who loses money."
And the committees reviewing policy for the Mayor-elect are considering whether a variety of services now provided by the city might be done more efficiently by private groups. One committee, for example, has recommended privatization as an option for the city's Emergency Medical Service.
Though he offered few details during the campaign, Mr. Giuliani has praised the idea of selling off agencies or contracting out services as a way to create a leaner, more efficient government. The early proposals have made it clear that he intends to make a broad push for privatization soon after taking office, exempting few services from consideration, his aides said.
 
Praising the Profit Motive
 "We have to ask ourselves," said John S. Dyson, who is to serve as Mr. Giuliani's deputy mayor for economic issues, "can the government ever run government as effectively as somebody in the private sector with the profit motive?"
But it remains to be seen whether privatization will prove to be the panacea of municipal reform or whether it will merely serve as a hammer that Mr. Giuliani can use to extract concessions from municipal unions.
Under Mayor David N. Dinkins, New York City has already taken small, tentative steps toward having some services performed by contractors -- from managing centers for the elderly to inspecting boilers in commercial buildings. But it has lagged behind efforts in other cities, including Chicago, Philadelphia and Phoenix.
Earlier this year the New York City Partnership and the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimated that the city could increase revenue by $16 billion over the next decade if it privatized bus service, garbage collection and the water supply and treatment systems.
Mr. Giuliani's plans are certain to encounter the greatest resistance from those unions, and their supporters in the City Council, who fear that putting services in private hands will ultimately cost city workers their jobs.
In fact, the unions mounted an intense effort in the City Council to push through legislation that would slow efforts to privatize agencies by requiring detailed studies and extensive public hearings -- an effort ultimately blocked by Mr. Dinkins on Monday.
 
OTB Is a Target
 Few of Mr. Giuliani's proposals have been fully developed, and his aides declined to identify all of the agencies or services that might be considered candidates for privatization, though during the campaign Mr. Giuliani mentioned such services as hospitals, garbage collection and the operation of Kennedy International Airport.
Another prime candidate has become the Offtrack Betting Corporation, the city's beleaguered parimutuel betting agency. Formed in 1970, the agency was once a source of huge profits, generating $40 million for the city at its peak in 1977, only to struggle to break even in recent years.
Mr. Giuliani and his top aides, including Mr. Dyson and Peter J. Powers, met this week with officials of the New York Racing Association, which operates the state's race tracks, to discuss ways to privatize OTB.
Mr. Dyson said the new administration might first try to hire a manager to improve its operation but would seek a buyer soon. He added that the racing association was an obvious choice since it had expressed interest before, but that the administration would consider any bids, as well as the possibility of keeping the agency if it proved profitable again.
The Dinkins administration has already set a timetable for selling the agency after commissioning a study by Morgan Stanley & Company that estimated its sale could reap at least $55 million.
But that study recommended postponing a sale until the agency became more attractive to potential buyers. Under its current president, Hazel N. Dukes, the agency has streamlined service and reduced its administrative staff. Last month the Dinkins administration projected its sale by the end of 1994.
Mr. Giuliani also indicated his interest in privatization of the city's hospital system this week as he announced his selections to run the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, including Dr. Bruce Siegel, the New Jersey Health Commissioner, who has praised privatization.
Under a proposal now being drafted by Mr. Giuliani's aides, private, nonprofit boards would take control of as many as three of the city's municipal hospitals.
A senior policy adviser, Richard W. Schwartz, said the changes, while intended to shake up the city's health-care bureaucracy, would be put into effect without reducing the level of care or prompting layoffs of city workers, as many opponents of privatization fear.
Mr. Powers, who is to serve as Mr. Giuliani's top deputy mayor, said the new administration's broad goal was to introduce the concept of competition to city services.
 
Following Phoenix's Lead
 He cited the example of Phoenix, which has put out contracts each year for garbage collection, allowing private companies as well as the city's Sanitation Department to bid for contracts in districts. While the private companies won most of the bids, the city's department has become more efficient and now regularly underbids them. Earlier this year, the city estimated that it had saved $23.9 million since 1980 under the program.
"Competition is the key word," Mr. Powers said. "That's how you get lower costs and more efficiency."
Mr. Powers said the Giuliani administration would look at virtually every service that the city offers to consider whether such an approach could produce savings.
He added that the administration would try to reassure the city's unions, possibly by requiring that private companies hire displaced workers, and that it would also work to persuade a public often wary of turning over control of services traditionally performed by the government.
"This is something we're going to look at from Day 1, but we're not going to rush to privatize all of New York City," Mr. Powers said. "We want to move carefully. If you move too fast, the potential for making mistakes is much greater."

HEADLINE: Oldest Dairy Farm Is Put to Last Pasture

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNION VALE, N.Y.

 BODY:
After 199 years of raising animals and growing crops to feed them, the oldest farm in Dutchess County is going out of business.
The 200-acre Ken-Ray Farm here, founded in 1794, auctioned off its herd of 160 cows last month and plans a spring sale of tractors, balers, manure wagons and plows. The land itself is on the market, too, at a price of $1.5 million. 
 "It's not because I wanted to retire, but dairy farming is no longer profitable," said Raymond Vail, 66. Ever since he was old enough to walk to the barn, he has been working on the farm, which is named after him and his brother, Kenneth, who died in 1975.
He said that low prices for milk, the sluggish economy and high property taxes were chiefly responsible for the decision to go out of business.
 
A Continuing Decline
 The demise of the Ken-Ray Farm has become another statistic in the continuing decline of dairy farms in Dutchess County and the United States. The Federal Department of Agriculture reported 171,560 dairy farms in the nation in 1992, down from 181,270 in 1991.
In New York, the third-leading dairy state in the nation behind California and Wisconsin, the number of dairy farms dropped from 15,371 in 1982 to 10,625 in 1992, according to the State Department of Agriculture and Markets. But milk volume has remained high, largely because of increased production per cow on large farms.
Over all, the remaining dairy farms in the state are in healthy shape, with $1.53 billion of milk and milk products sold in 1992, up from $1.4 billion the year before. Geographically, though, the picture is spotty, with upstate farms doing well and downstate farms poorly, mainly because of taxes.
"One of the problem areas is in the Hudson Valley corridor between New York City and Albany," said Richard T. McGuire, the state Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets. "The real property tax is double there compared to what they are paying in the rest of the state."
 
Only 52 Left
 Today, there are only 52 dairy farms in Dutchess County, down from 105 in 1987 and from 275 in 1972, said David Tetor, the dairy agent for Cornell University's Cooperative Extension Service.
He said he expected three or four more farms in the county to go out of business before the end of the winter, in part because of drought that forces farmers to choose between selling their herd or buying feed to support them, in part because of longer-term economic pressures on farms here on the northern fringe of the New York City metropolitan region.
"If you ask farmers here what their major problem is, they will reply taxes," he said. "And what drives taxes up is people moving into the area."
The impact of a growing population is evident around the Ken-Ray Farm, particularly new houses and housing developments on Route 55 between the Taconic State Parkway and Pawling.
For Mr. Vail, the result of increased services required for the rising population has been a property tax of $24,000 a year, double what it was 10 years ago.
 
Stayed Too Long
 "Five years ago we considered selling out, but we wanted to farm as long as possible and we probably continued too long," he said. "This year was probably the worst crop year since the 1950's because of the drought. To stay in business we would have to buy feed, and we didn't have the money."
An added reason for selling this year was to settle the estate of his brother and co-owner, he said.
Mr. Vail, who has six children and 12 grandchildren, worked the farm with a son-in-law, Victor Holmes, and an assistant, Peter Deforest. Mr. Holmes now works for an excavating company and Mr. Deforest has been elected highway superintendent of Union Vale.
But Mr. Vail is still on the farm, uncertain about the future. Standing in an empty barn where he once milked up to 100 cows twice a day, Mr. Vail looked out a window at the empty farm fields and mused about his changed way of life.
 
The Natural Life
 "What I think I am going to miss the most, is looking out and seeing the cows out there," he said. "I liked coming into the barn at 4:30 in the morning to see the sun come up and hear the birds sing."
For the time being, he goes into the barn at 6 A.M. to milk two cows that he retained -- Millie, a Jersey, and Jamie, a Holstein -- and to care for nine calves that he has kept for his grandchildren.
He and his wife, Eleanor, a nurse who works at Sharon Hospital in nearby Connecticut, live in a house on the border of the farm, and plan to stay there after the land is sold.
"I'm a little on edge," Mrs. Vail said. "I was getting ready to retire, but now I'll have to wait and see what's going to happen on the farm."

HEADLINE: The State of the Game: In Extra Innings, No Score

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH

 BODY:
For the better part of half an hour, Bud Selig, the titular head of baseball, recently tried to sum up the state of the game. He talked about the restructuring and filling of the commissioner's office, which has been vacated for 16 months after the forced resignation of Fay Vincent, and he addressed the many pending policy matters that often seem to be in indeterminable states of being.
"When all is said and done, and our industry is looked at in the retrospect of history, people will understand exactly what we were trying to do," said Selig, baseball's acting commissioner since September 1992. 
 But, when asked if even he understands the situation all the time, Selig laughed. "No, not all the time," he said. "Some days, the understanding is quite muddled, to be perfectly blunt about it."
 
Congress Is Watching
 So it is for almost everyone connected with baseball.
How could it not be? After all, baseball moves into year two of life without a commissioner, and with a watchful Congress waiting to see if a new person to preside over baseball is appointed next month, as promised.
Meanwhile, of the two men charged with making the wheels of baseball turn in the interim, one of them, Peter N. T. Widdrington, chairman of the Toronto Blue Jays, left the position earlier this month, partly out of frustration. And retirement seems imminent for the other person, Dick Wagner, a former baseball club executive.
Widdrington temporarily signed on as chief administrator for what he thought would be three or four months only to find himself stationed in New York for nine months. Now he has departed. "I guess I'm just not quite used to the way things happen in baseball," he said. "My goal has always been to be effective and not let people down. To do that, I have to have a little bit of running room."
But running room is exactly what those in the central office lack these days because of the expected transition to a new commissioner and a restructuring that could change the nature of the way everything in baseball -- from marketing to revenue-sharing -- is conducted.
"It's fair to the new person that we not make a lot of new policy decisions," said one baseball executive, looking ahead to the naming of a new commissioner. "If you and I were coming to a new job, you and I wouldn't like to pick up a lot of stuff that had been done in the last 30 days."
And, insisted Selig, "The fact is that there will be a new commissioner one day."
Meanwhile, other changes and important decisions are being discussed.
Both the National and American Leagues are soon expected to bid adieu to their presidents. Employees in baseball's New York office sweat out rumors that there will be layoffs and that the headquarters will be moved to Chicago.
On the labor front, the basic agreement with the players union expires this week, and contract discussions have yet to ensue. And the much-ballyhooed three-division, multi-tiered playoff system is stalled in negotiations between management and the Players Association.
Baseball is also about to enter year one of its brave new world in which its major national television contract comes with no guaranteed revenue.
Still, in the midst of the seeming muddle, Selig insists that the world be patient.
"As we move along, we have to get three divisions done and we have to do a lot of other things, but at least we've addressed our problems, restructuring and otherwise," Selig said. "And remember, a year ago there was hysteria -- 'we don't have a commissioner, we don't have this, we don't have that.' But now there is no acrimony. It's really been an absolutely remarkable year."
So it is that Selig, a self-described optimist, prefers to believe that it will all work out. That revenue-sharing will save small-market teams such as his own. That the television deal with be a boon, not a boondoggle.
He prefers to point out that the angst in the central office in New York, as well as rumors of moves to Chicago, are decades old. As for actual layoffs, Selig, a realist, merely points out that no decisions have been made, but that baseball is an industry facing hard times within a national economy doing the same.
 
Listen to the Ticking
 Moves. Changes. Restructuring. Again, it's a myriad of decisions yet to be made, or at least made public. And when Selig says a lot of things have yet to be done, what is left unsaid is that they have to be done against a background in which some very loud clocks are ticking down.
The final bell on the great revenue sharing debate should sound Jan. 6. That's when the big-market owners and small-market owners will meet in Chicago. It is their high noon, when they should decide, at last, whether or not they will find a new, more economically equitable way of sharing the 28 varying pools of local revenue.
The biggest pools the owners want in on still belong solely to the Yankees' George Steinbrenner and the Mets' Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday. The general belief remains that as Steinbrenner and the other richer teams on the East Coast go, so should revenue sharing.
Then comes Jan. 18-19, when the owners are scheduled to meet again and basically try to settle everything else, including the decision on the nominee for commissioner. Or so Selig hopes. To this day, Selig, the owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, insists that he is the man who would not be commissioner, despite feverish draft efforts by some of his fellow owners.
 
The Candidates
 Since Selig refuses to waver, other considerations must be made. And, indeed, other names continue to seep out. Such as Paul Kirk, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee; Harvey Schiller, the executive director of the United States Olympic Committee; Dick Thornburgh, the former United States Attorney General, and Senator George Mitchell, the Democrats' majority leader from Maine.
While the great mystery continues, so does a correlating mystery of what the commissioner's office will look like once it has a warm body.
Selig insists the commissioner's role will be stronger. The restructuring, he says, will clarify a lot of the gray areas, ambiguities that he believes led to so much animosity in the past.
Until baseball owners start to unveil some answers, to reach some decisions, it will always seem a muddle on some days, as Selig said. He must now find ways to reduce those days in number, if only to assure history will treat this current era as kindly as he hopes.

Patience Is More Than a Virtue for McIlvaine; It's a Strategy

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Joe McIlvaine, the man with the mandate to restore the Mets to respectability, then to greater heights, has spent the past couple of months looking for a couple of teams to twist his arm and wrest Bret Saberhagen and Bobby Bonilla away from him in exchange for a shortstop, perhaps a starting pitcher and an assortment of promising young players.
Trading high-priced stars for low-paid young players. If the idea rings a bell from a previous McIlvaine job, bang the gong loudly. As general manager of the San Diego Padres, McIlvaine was directed by the Gang of 15 -- the owners -- to divest the club of its high-priced stars instantly, if not yesterday. 
 But McIlvaine found that chore distasteful -- is this any way to run a ball club? -- and opted to forgo the remaining half of his contract, two and a half years worth. Still, in talking to other clubs about Saberhagen and Bonilla, is McIlvaine not engaging in the same kind of activity he shunned in San Diego? If not, what's the difference?
"That's easy," McIlvaine said, responding to the questions without needing time to form an answer. "In San Diego, we had a contending team and all of a sudden we were ordered to dismantle it because they didn't want to contend anymore. Here, I came into a situation where we're in last place, it's a rebuilding effort and you have to divest yourself of some of your high-priced talent and get younger players.
"If I was in San Diego in last place, I'd do the same thing. I'd move some of the high-priced guys to get multiples. I was guarding against that in San Diego because I thought with the addition of a pitcher or two, we could win. We were a pitcher or two away from winning in '92. Ed Whitson went down and didn't pitch all year. We never really found a replacement for him."
With 35 games remaining in 1992, on Aug. 28, the Padres were in third place, only six games from the top. That was as close as they would come to first place that late in the season most likely for years. The dismantling process already had begun. About three months earlier, the Padres' owners had begun telling McIlvaine to begin shedding the high-priced players.
The Mets' owners haven't told McIlvaine whom to trade and whom to keep. Nor, they have said, have they placed economic restrictions on him. They brought McIlvaine back because they had confidence that he could pull the Mets out of the quagmire in which they have drowned the past two seasons.
In attacking his chore, McIlvaine has passed up the quick-fix method -- signing proven but expensive free agents. McIlvaine sees expense in two ways -- money and lost draft choices as compensation for free agents.
He won't pursue Walt Weiss to plug the shortstop hole because the signing would cost the Mets their second-round pick in next June's amateur draft. He wouldn't pursue Rafael Palmeiro because he felt paying him about $6 million a year wouldn't be worth it considering the club won't be contending for any division championships the next couple of seasons.
Yet Palmeiro would have helped restore respectability, something the fans will have to see before they begin returning to Shea Stadium. Shrunken attendance resulting from their putrid performance cost the Mets $25 million or more in gate receipts the past two seasons. Mets fans have a history of letting the proprietors know (see 1979) when they don't like their product.
But McIlvaine remains undaunted by the failure to add a proven player who could convince the fans the club is serious about giving them an improved product.
"It's December," he said. "Time is not up yet on that front. We're going to be competitive this year. There are enough irons in the fire that some type of veteran will come to us. The off season runs from October to April. You don't get all your business done in October and you don't get all your business done in April. The time to look is April, when the season is ready to begin, and see what has happened."
Anyway, McIlvaine said, his best time for trading is spring training. Even more specifically, it's March 27. On that date in 1987, the Mets acquired David Cone from Kansas City, and on that date in 1992, the Padres obtained Gary Sheffield from Milwaukee.
"You just seem to be able to do something at that time," McIlvaine said. "Or one you've been working on all winter comes to fruition.
"In a normal year, you have to do less," he added. "But this year we have to do more. We're getting there. We're just about on schedule."
 
 
Looking for His Star
 Based on his performance in 1992, his second full season in the major leagues, Ray Lankford, the St. Louis Cardinals' center fielder, appeared ready to work his way into the corps of outstanding young players who have begun to dominate the majors. Lankford, though, fell from the threshold with a thud last season.
His batting average plummeted 55 points, from .293 to .238, his slugging percentage 134 points, from .480 to .346; his home-run output plunged from 20 to 7, he drove in 45 runs instead of 86 and he had 14 stolen bases in 28 attempts after having 42 in 66 tries the year before.
"We went down to the instructional league and he was a very good student down there," Cardinals Manager Joe Torre said of Lankford's recent activity. "The disappointment I had in Ray Lankford doesn't even approach the disappointment he had in himself. He was down there working on things, working on swinging the bat. His enthusiasm leads me to believe last year was a fluke. It was probably a lot of things piling up on him that he had trouble overcoming."
 
 
Dykstra at the Top of the Order
 Eat your heart out, Rickey.
The four-year extension Mark Fleisher has negotiated for Lenny Dykstra with the Philadelphia Phillies is the sort of deal Rickey Henderson thought he should get when he became a free agent last month. But Henderson fell far short as the two leadoff batters gained distinctly disparate contracts that were in direct proportion to their World Series performances.
Henderson's team, the Toronto Blue Jays, won, but Henderson played so poorly and Dykstra so spectacularly he put Henderson firmly in his shadow as the leadoff man of the moment. As it was, Henderson, 35 years old yesterday, received more from Oakland than many baseball people expected, $8.6 million for two years. Dykstra, soon to be 31, will get $24.9 million for four years beginning in 1995.
Even though Henderson's previous contract made him one of the two highest-paid players at $3 million a year, he never was happy with it. He would be even less happy if he knew that in the four years between that contract and this one, 141 players signed contracts worth more than $3 million a year.

N.F.L.'s Remote Control

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
Fox is Football and Football is Fox, and has been for at least two years; when "In Living Color" counterprogrammed the 1992 Super Bowl halftime show it became clear that the adolescent sensibility of the fourth network was a perfect fit with crunch time. The halftime show is a window into the soul of football; need we be reminded that Michael Jackson starred in the last one?
At first, football may not be as popular on Fox as it has been on the traditional networks because football as cartoon entertainment is fading. Real cartoon heroes like Bart Simpson make more sense than human cartoon heroes like steroidian linemen. Real cartoon heroes require less maintenance, fewer drugs, no money and can be erased. 
 But it won't matter because Rupert Murdoch, who can envision the future because he can create it, has sensed football's enormous potential as that ultimate video game for adults, the interactive gambling show.
Let's back up a bit. All of this happened because power always shifts. Ike was President when CBS began broadcasting National Football League games in 1956, Mickey Mantle was being booed and the hot books were "Peyton Place" and "The Organization Man." In the era of togetherness and crabgrass, men needed a socially acceptable way of tuning out women on Sunday afternoons. What better way than watching better men cream one another?
The N.F.L. was then dominated by clans like the Maras of New York and the Rooneys of Pittsburgh, Irishmen struggling to establish themselves in an English-oriented country, pioneers of the game, former legal bookmakers, men who ran their clubs despotically, benevolently and, whether or not you were on the same page with them, by their own moral standards. The Giants even had a Catholic chaplain who had the run of the cluhouse. The sons and nephews of the Clan and its allies grew up as ballboys and press-box runners and went into TV and advertising.
As the new princes of Manhattan, they carried the Clan's sensibilities on the invisible tramway that moved from the Polo Grounds to Toots Shor's, later P. J. Clarke's (they were called "watering holes" then) to Brooks Brothers to Black Rock. It was basically New York Giant football players and advertising executives and CBS sports producers, young and smart and energetic, who created this multibillion dollar industry from hot air waves. Their beau ideal was Frank Gifford, Giant star, Mara darling, nighthawk, eventually a CBS sportscaster.
The real dominance of CBS lasted only into the late 60's. The American Football League, led by Jewish newcomers like Al Davis of the Oakland Raiders and Sonny Werblin of the New York Jets, fronted by the son of Hungarian immigrants, Joe Namath of the white shoes and the truth (sex and whisky go with football), forced a merger and the shuffling of loyalties and power. Roone Arledge of the American Broadcasting Company may not have invented television sports but he shaped it into a mass entertainment. He also raided CBS (as CBS once raided NBC) for top production and on-air talent and made Monday night the logical extension of Sunday afternoon.
The wheel turns. The kind of loyalty the Maras and CBS enjoyed had to do with lack of options. Do we need to repeat that Notre Dame was the Gipper's third or fifth or eighth college? Or that Jumpin' Joe Dugan, the Ruth Era Yankee, got his name from his propensity to switch leagues? Remember Robert Irsay, who moved the Colts from Baltimore to Indianapolis in the middle of the night? Even Gifford jumped ship for ABC.
And now Murdoch, another newcomer pushing his way into mainstream power and confirming that power. Murdoch verified the old established league's social and economic importance. But he did more than that as far as the current group of owners were concerned. He insured the league's future in America and the world.
Murdoch is a main toll collector on the information highway, perhaps the world's most wired man. He has the hardware and the organization to send those football games, those halftime shows, those Coke commercials into every corner of the known universe. Football is not baseball, which you need to understand to enjoy. Football is Nintendo for big boys.
And the next major step in the evolution of sports, the inevitable step being slowed by state legislatures lobbied by major sports organizations, is universal sports betting on American games. It may even come to foreign countries before it is fully legalized here. And Fox will not only carry the games, but it will air the interactive shows that will make it possible for millions of Chinese to someday sit in their homes and bet on games, on quarters, on over and unders, on whether or not a pass will be completed.
That's what happened last week when Fox and Football, the future, got together. Let's enjoy it and not whine about loyalty and hostile takeover and the end of Western civilization. John Madden and Terry Bradshaw personally presided over the end of Western civilization while at CBS, and if sports TV history is a guideline, you can bet on them to jump to Fox and into sports' New Age.

HEADLINE: The Honor Roll, of Sorts, for 1993

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IT WAS a wonderful year in the stock market, but not for all companies. Some suffered for treating their customers badly, some for being too nice to them. Some executives found opportunity in adversity, some made their own opportunity and some showed fortuitous timing. And any year in which a football player becomes a Wall Street star clearly deserves note. There will, unfortunately, be no presentation ceremony for the following, richly deserved, awards.
 
 
Fire the Messenger Award
 To Prudential Securities, for dumping its ad agency as bad publicity grew. The new agency is to find a slogan to replace "the most important thing we earn is your trust," which became embarrassing after Prudential agreed to pay $371 million to customers for abusing that trust when it sold highly dubious limited partnerships in the 1980's. Our suggested slogan: "Let buygones be bygones."
 
Employment Security Award
To the top executives of General Motors, who gave themselves employment contracts in the wake of the departure to Volkswagen of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the first (and so far only) G.M. executive to prove to have marketable skills.
 
Brilliant Management Award
To Maytag, the appliance giant, whose British executives cleverly calculated that they could bolster sales by offering two free trans-Atlantic plane tickets to anyone who bought at least $375 worth of appliances. They were stunned when 200,000 people in Britain and Ireland tried to take them up on it.
 
Fool Me Once . . . Award
To Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, the large New York law firm. Proskauer signed on to represent Towers Financial, the collapsing empire of the erstwhile publisher of The New York Post, Steven Hoffenberg, in suits alleging Towers had welched on fees it owed to other law firms. Having failed to get payment up front, Proskauer wound up suing Mr. Hoffenberg and Towers for -- surprise -- unpaid legal fees.
 
Watch What I Do . . . Award
To Michael Dell, chairman of Dell Computer. On March 9, he proclaimed that Dell was clearly in "the winner's circle" and said that "the power of our direct marketing approach continues to be underestimated." Within the next three weeks, he took in $11.3 million selling Dell stock, at an average price of $38 a share. By summer, as profits turned to losses, the shares were fetching less than $15.
 
Best Self-Deal Award
To John Malone, the president and chief executive of Tele-Communications Inc. In 1991, he spun off Liberty Media from the parent company, on terms that discouraged public holders from taking Liberty while allowing him to buy a lot of its shares without putting up much cash. Now T.C.I. is repurchasing Liberty -- on vastly more friendly terms -- as a prelude to its own acquisition by Bell Atlantic. But for the earlier transactions, the Bell Atlantic takeover might have been worth less than $100 million to Mr. Malone. Now, his stake will be worth about $1 billion.
 
Due Diligence Award: Lawyer Division
To the New York firm of Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent, Sheinfeld & Sorkin. The firm helped to take public a company whose chief financial officer turned out to be a disbarred lawyer who had served time after being convicted of stealing money from clients. Asked if the firm knew about the criminal record, which was not disclosed to investors, a partner shrugged off the query. "That is not the responsibility of the law firm," explained Howard Squadron.
 
Due Diligence Award: Executive Division
To John Sculley, who left Apple Computer to take over Spectrum Information Technologies. He expressed surprise when asked about a variety of Spectrum's past brushes with regulatory authorities. "It sounds like you know more about it than I do at this point," he told a reporter.
 
All Bluster, No Bite Award
To Robert Crandall of American Airlines, for his repeated threats to replace flight attendants if they struck, without having any effective plan to deal with a walkout. When it happened just before Thanksgiving, there was chaos, red ink and a quick surrender by American.
 
 
Labor Leader Of the Year Award
To Denise Hedges, head of the flight attendants union at American, for calling Mr. Crandall's bluff and providing organized labor with one of its few prominent victories in recent years.
 
Stock Promoter Of the Year Award
To Lawrence Taylor, the linebacker for the New York Giants and part-time president of All-Pro Products, a company with virtually no operations whose stock almost tripled in its first seven days of trading. After that move, Mr. Taylor forecast it would double again, leaving him with stock worth $20 million, for which he had paid $5,750. So far, the market value is holding at about $10 million.
 
I.P.O. Reversal Award: Winning Division
To Motor Coach Industries, the bus manufacturer sold to the public by the Dial Corporation, at $13 a share in August. The price cracked within minutes of the beginning of trading, and went as low as $11 in the next few weeks. But in November, the company agreed to be acquired by a Mexican firm -- for stock worth $16.72 a share.
 
I.P.O. Reversal Award: Losing Division
To Mathsoft, a software company that went public in February at $13, with insiders selling 1.25 million shares. The shares traded for $23 the first day. But they fell when the company posted disappointing profits in April, and again in July when it said it was losing money. By September the share price was below $5 -- and is only a bit higher now.
 
Bad P.R. Award
To CS First Boston. In a year in which Wall Street compensation rose into the stratosphere, it was the only firm that came in for heavy media criticism -- not for paying too much but for paying too little. Some investment bankers -- insulted by annual bonuses of less than $1 million -- drew sympathy as they fled to other, less parsimonious, firms.
 
Clouded Crystal Ball Award
To Bennett LeBow, for his forecast that Skybox International would be trading above $14 a share by early 1994. Brooke Group, Mr. LeBow's troubled conglomerate, had valued Skybox at that price in distributing shares as part of a plan to evade making good on a previous guarantee about Brooke's stock price. The current value of Skybox is under $7.
 
Career Timing Award
To Louis V. Gerstner Jr., for abandoning tobacco by resigning as chief executive of RJR Nabisco a few days before Philip Morris devastated industry profits by slashing cigarette prices. Mr. Gerstner took over I.B.M., where the bad news was already known to everyone.
 
Money Can't Buy Harmony Award
To the members of the Haft family, who built a retail empire consisting of the Dart Drug, Trak Auto and Crown Book chains and in the process came to thoroughly despise each other. Herbert, the dad, fired one son. Another son lined up with Dad, but Mom and Sis stood with the fired son. Everybody has sued everybody else, repeatedly.
 
Public Service Award
To Carlos Alves dos Santos, former budget director of Brazil, who was found to have $1.7 million stuffed in his mattress, plus $300,000 and 212 pounds of gold (value, about $1 million) in safety deposit boxes.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Holiday Cheer for the Toronto Market

BYLINE: By Clyde H. Farnsworth

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
CANADA'S stock markets must know something the people don't. In contrast to a general year-end mood of sullenness and pessimism, reflecting high joblessness, taxes and debt, the markets have never been more buoyant.
The Toronto Stock Exchange, which does 78 percent of all the trading in the land, has risen 25 percent this year, as measured by its leading index, outperforming Wall Street and many other markets abroad. Volume has never been stronger. 
 The story was roughly similar for Montreal, with 17 percent of the activity; Vancouver, with 3 percent, and the Alberta and Winnipeg exchanges, which do the rest of the business.
"We're sort of firing on all cylinders," said Tony Massie, portfolio manager of the Global Strategy of Canada Growth Fund, who manages $275 million of assets from Vancouver.
It's been a long time since Canadian markets have generated such enthusiasm. The recession has been far deeper and longer here than in the United States. Companies struggling in a freer trade environment have laid off tens of thousands of workers and made heavy use of labor-saving technology. The unemployment rate is nearly twice as high as in the United States.
But now the tide seems to be turning. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which keeps tabs on the developed world, says Canada's economic growth will outpace that of every industrial country except Turkey in the next two years.
Bay Street, Canada's equivalent to Wall Street, is encouraged not only by growth prospects but the country's improved competitiveness.
The Canadian dollar, at around 75 cents, is near a six-year low. Inflation, at under 2 percent, is below that in the United States. Corporate restructuring has brought pain but also the productivity gains that translate into a higher percentage of revenues falling to the bottom line as profits.
Fred Ketchen, senior vice president and director of equity trading at ScotiaMcLeod Inc., a Toronto brokerage house, said he anticipated another 20 percent rise in the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Index in 1994, fueled by "substantial increases in corporate income."
In August, the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Index finally eclipsed its old high set back in 1987. Since August that index has set 14 new highs. The most recent high was 4,307.67 on Dec. 8. The close last Thursday was 4,246.39. (The market was closed Friday and will be closed tomorrow.)
Bullishness has been accompanied by ever increasing volume. Toronto's daily average of 60 million shares is almost twice last year's figure but still only a third to a quarter of the daily trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The pure economic function of stock markets -- the raising of new capital for entrepreneurs -- was also well served. Investors bought $20 billion Canadian of new equity in 1993, nearly twice the $11 billion of 1992, the previous record year.
Further encouraging Bay Street's bulls has been a pickup in global economic activity, led by the United States, which means greater demand for the resource-based commodities in which Canada specializes. Gold, base metals, forest products and other such raw materials make up a quarter of the value of Toronto's listed stocks.
"Canada's day is coming," said George Domolky, who manages $1 billion of Canadian assets in two mutual funds of the Fidelity Group in Boston. "People want to live better in the world, and this means demand for things Canada produces, such as lumber, nickel and gold."
While Canada is just another international market to American investors, Mr. Domolky noted, "it has the advantage of having the same accounting methods, the same management style, and people speak the same language." Fidelity, the world's largest collection of mutual funds, altogether holds about $5 billion in Canadian stocks.
Toronto's gold index has doubled in 1993; oil stocks are up about a third and forest products 50 percent.
Yet there were a number of other high fliers. The robustness of the North American auto industry has meant especially big gains for Canadian steel and auto-parts companies. Magna International, one of the stars in auto parts, went from $35 to more than $60 this year and had been as low as $2.50 in 1991. Stelco, the biggest steel company, soared from $1 to around $8 this year.
Some high technology companies have also done well. Newbridge Networks, which discovered ways to punch more data through a line, has tripled this year to around $70 and was as low as $4 the year before. Delrina, which worked out a way to fax material from a personal computer, has jumped sixfold to around $25.
While many Bay Streeters remain optimistic, they also note hazards ahead. Quebec appears ready to elect a new separatist government in 1994, which once again will raise questions about national unity. Canada's fiscal problems are even more severe than those of the United States and may require draconian spending cuts.
Noted James Muir, director of RG Capital Management, asset management arm of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd., a Toronto investment firm, "the markets could still get a little jittery."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
A Toy Indicator May Indicate A Bearish 1994

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IT was the Christmas of hope on Wall Street.
Ever since 1990, the financial community has entered the holiday season with profound doubts about the ability, or the willingness, of Americans to spend enough to make Christmas merry for retailers. 
 But this year was different. There was optimism, about both the economy and the Christmas season. As it turns out, Christmas expectations may have been a bit excessive. If so, this will have been a quite decent season, but one that was still a bit disappointing for many storekeepers.
And in that fact may lie a bearish indicator for the stock market in 1994. When Wall Street Christmas expectations prove optimistic, the next year tends to have some unpleasant surprises for stockholders.
The final Christmas sales figures are not in yet, of course, but share buyers appear to be suspicious. Sears, by all accounts, is doing quite well this season. But its stock is off 5 percent since Thanksgiving and still doing better than the Standard & Poor's index of general retailers, of which it is a part. That index is down 10 percent, while the specialty retailer index is off 2 percent. And that has come as most stocks have advanced. Americans may not be buying as many toys, of either the child or adult variety, as the seers had expected.
The course of retail stocks in this most important of seasons has generally been up in recent years. The last time the index of general retailers dropped was in 1986. The specialty retailer index has fallen only two other times in recent years, in 1986 and 1989. One does not have to be a stock-market historian to recall that both 1987 and 1990 produced a lot of negative volatility. Or, to put it in the upbeat tone that is more appropriate for the season of hope, buying opportunities were created.
As Robert Barbera, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers, points out, the causes of the market setbacks of 1987 and 1990 did not have much in common. In 1987, the economy was so strong that the Fed felt a need to tighten credit. In the midst of a speculative frenzy, the stock market ignored higher interest rates for months, but then crashed in what proved to be a massive overreaction brought on by a combination of panic and a foolish institutional investment strategy called portfolio insurance. In 1990, the problem was a weak economy aggravated by worries over higher oil prices brought on by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Last week's report that personal income rose nicely in November helped to confirm that the economy is gaining strength, but the big question for share buyers is how much of that is already in prices. "I think the economy will do fine, rates will go up, and we will have a correction," said Mr. Barbera, noting that economically sensitive stocks did very well the last two years.
The slightly disappointing Christmas season is no guarantee that 1994 will bring stock market problems like those of 1987 or 1990. But it is a reminder that it can be easier to exceed low expectations than it is to meet high ones.

HEADLINE: At Newsstands, Black Is Plentiful

BYLINE: By MICHAEL E. ROSS

 BODY:
AT a boisterous prepublication open house recently, Sheryl E. Huggins, the publisher of Shade, weaved through a crowd of black artists, writers, photographers and others, music from A Tribe Called Quest booming from the stereo.
There in one room at the magazine's Manhattan office, wearing everything from business suits to dreadlocks, was a microcosm of the diverse readership Ms. Huggins hopes to attract when Shade makes its debut in March -- a microcosm, too, of a black diversity that has fostered a flurry of new magazines. 
 For years the world of black publishing could largely be defined in two words: Ebony and Jet. Ebony was founded in 1945 and Jet in 1951, both by the Johnson Publishing Company, in Chicago, and with a combined circulation of two million, they have paced the field. Since then, black magazines have appeared infrequently, in fits and starts, with the most notable being Black Enterprise, about business matters, in 1970, and Essence, for black women, in 1971.
In recent years, though, black publishing has exploded. When Shade appears, it will join a crowded, raucous field of fledgling publications devoted to various aspects of black culture, from health to entertainment, hair care to politics.
Here's a sampling: Vibe (Time Warner's new magazine, begun in June), The Source (May 1991) and YSB (September 1991) focus on music, life styles and culture. Emerge (October 1989) and Upscale (February 1990) concentrate on news and social issues. Black Elegance (June 1986) examines fashion, while Heart & Soul, started by Rodale Press in June, addresses health issues. And African Voices, started in April by a Brooklyn-based journalist, seeks a literary audience.
This burst of activity is rooted in recognition of a lucrative market. As a sense of black identity widens, publishers and advertisers have discovered that black America is not a monolith of attitudes and opinions, but a rich mixture lending itself to numerous expressions in print -- and numerous opportunities for advertising.
"The 'black audience' is very diverse," said James Bernard, editor of The Source, a monthly whose circulation has topped 100,000. "People realize there's more than one type of black person, and more than one type of young black person."
It was perhaps inevitable that black diversity and niche marketing would come together to create a variety of black magazines for a national audience. Now, it is equally inevitable that those magazines will be subject to publishing's law of natural selection: only the well-financed, well-advertised and well-positioned survive.
In the constant battle for newsstand supremacy, with newsstands groaning from the weight of specialty publications, the biggest challenge facing any newcomer is distinguishing itself from the crowd, making its mission clear.
And new black magazines can expect an especially difficult time attracting and holding new advertisers, which often cannot justify new expenses when many mainstream publications already reach black readers.
"If you have a magazine that reaches an audience no one else is reaching or reaches them in a unique way, regardless of its niche, the magazine can do very well," said Roberta Garfinkel, director of print media for the ad agency McCann-Erickson. "The pie is the available dollars there are to spend, and it doesn't grow. The more choices advertisers have, the more carefully they have to spend money."
Edward J. Atorino, an analyst with Dillon, Read, said: "It's easy to launch magazines. The test will come in the next economic downturn."
The battle for survival has led to creative strategies for getting a magazine in the public eye, and keeping it there. One of the more unusual approaches has cashed in on the perception that black magazines are a lot alike.
In February 1992, six magazines embarked on a marketing strategy starkly different from the usual winner-take-all approach. The six -- Emerge, Ebony, Essence, Black Enterprise, YSB and Black Elegance -- linked themselves in displays in 2,700 stores nationwide. The joint promotion, tied to Black History Month, yielded significant sales increases for all the magazines in 1992 and again in 1993, said Yvonne Pearson, a sales director for Essence and a manager of the cooperative project.
Five of the six will do it again next February. YSB dropped out, but Jet and Heart & Soul have signed on. Ms. Pearson said the 1994 promotion "will have 6,000 displays in stores, and we're looking to do more connecting with other venues -- radio, TV and the newspapers." While the promotion goes against the grain, it showed that established voices and relative unknowns could pool their efforts to dramatic effect.
THE genesis and development of two other magazines offer a clue on how some black magazines would weather a shakeout. YSB and Emerge are properties of Black Entertainment Television (BET), whose programming -- syndicated series, music videos and special-event coverage -- reaches about 36 million homes.
YSB (for Young Sisters and Brothers) began publication in September 1991, with a mission of attracting younger black readers. Debra L. Lee, YSB's president and publisher, said it was started mainly to reach teen-agers. "We saw there was nothing out there for teen-agers, who are facing guns in the schools, drugs, AIDS and other issues," she said. "We found a need."
The network began YSB after selling it with a three-part strategy: a splashy test issue mailed to prospective subscribers; a telephone offer to attract charter subscribers, at $14.95 for 10 months; and ads placed on BET. "We made YSB a household word quickly, through our reach into homes via cable," Ms. Lee said. YSB claims a paid circulation of 100,000.
Emerge, which addresses current affairs, politics and life styles for readers 25 to 54, was started in 1989 by Wilmer C. Ames Jr., a former reporter at Time magazine, with money from BET, Time Warner and private investors. The network acquired a controlling interest in December 1991, after buying Time Warner's 19.5 percent stake. The magazine, recently redesigned, puts its circulation at 150,000 -- "not exactly a ton of people," said Martin Walker, of Walker Communications, a New York consulting firm. "The fact that they're still around is a testament to their role in the marketplace."
Vibe, which calls itself a multicultural magazine, has a role in the marketplace that seems to work to the advantage of Time Warner, its owner.
"Time Warner has been looking for a way into the youth market," Mr. Walker said. "Vibe's good for that. It's a natural tie-in with the Warner side -- the movies and music, the synergy they want."
Ms. Lee sees room for even more black-oriented magazines, to a point.
"The marketplace is diverse enough, and there are enough untapped segments of that marketplace, that for readers it's wide open," she said. But as for advertising, "there may not be enough to go around."
While some new magazines begin with promising budgets -- Ms. Huggins said the cost for Shade was "definitely in the six-figure range" -- others began on a relative shoestring. African Voices was started in April on a modest $10,000, said Carolyn A. Butts, the editor and co-founder.
"We're interested in highlighting serious writers and artists," said Ms. Butts, a former reporter for The New York Post. "With the success of Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou and others, there's definitely an audience for black writers and artists, and a need for a magazine that highlights up-and-coming writers, the ones who'll take the reins for the next generation. We want to be The New Yorker of the black literary world."
While Vibe, The Source, Shade and African Voices are products of New York City, the growth of black magazine publishing is not just a New York phenomenon. YSB and Emerge are published in Washington. Upscale, based in Atlanta, boasts a paid circulation of 250,000, as well as full-color ads from national advertisers like Ford, Procter & Gamble and Philip Morris.
HEART & SOUL, which will begin quarterly publication in 1994, is based in Emmaus, Pa. And Image, which will focus on black men, with a print run estimated at 50,000 to 100,000, is set to begin in April from its base in Studio City, Calif., near Los Angeles.
The economy, of course, is always a factor in publishing. So does the sudden birth of so many magazines suggest that it has turned a corner? Not necessarily. Florestine Purnell, Emerge's managing editor, conceded that for much of 1993 "our ad pages have been down, though that's reflective of the industry as a whole."
And Ms. Garfinkel expressed the uncertainty that figures in all magazines' plans. "I'm not sure the economy's getting better," she said, "so much as I think it's not getting any worse."

HEADLINE: Mr. Giuliani's Mixed Start

 BODY:
Rudolph Giuliani says he wants to do things differently. Fine: that's why he was elected. But in building an administration, different does not have to mean inexperienced. So far, inexperience is the unfortunate distinction shared by Mr. Giuliani's designated deputies.
No fair New Yorker would ask Mr. Giuliani to staff his administration with veterans who represent the old ways of doing things. There are, however, professional, nonideological men and women whose knowledge could help guide a new government through the municipal morass. Former mayors were not shy about borrowing talent from previous administrations, and the city benefited. 
 Surely the Mayor-elect could have found some deputy mayors with more knowledge about New York City's complex government than the four he has chosen. Surely, too, he could have shown greater fidelity to his pledge to create a City Hall staff representing the city's diversity by including an African-American among his deputies.
His failure to do so sends a damaging message to a black community still shaken by David Dinkins's defeat. It is true that Mr. Giuliani has appointed a number of black commissioners, and several Latinos, but agency heads are not as influential as members of a mayor's inner circle.
Some of Mr. Giuliani's agency appointments are impressive. Paul Crotty, who will be his Corporation Counsel, was a commissioner under former Mayor Ed Koch; Mr. Crotty's calm temperament and knowledge about city government should be a great help to the new Mayor. The incoming Police Commissioner, William Bratton, and head of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, Dr. Bruce Siegel, have solid reputations. So does Luis Miranda Jr., who will chair the corporation's board of directors.
The budget director, Abraham Lackman, is an experienced number cruncher. The new head of the Human Resources Administration, Marva Hammons, is known for innovative ideas.
However admirable those appointees, none will serve on Mr. Giuliani's City Hall staff, and that's where the power is. Though he merits praise for his plans to trim staff at City Hall, reducing the number of deputy mayors from six to four, Mr. Giuliani would do himself and his city a favor by adding one more deputy -- a strong administrator with detailed knowledge of the city.
The Mayor-elect's top deputy, Peter Powers, is a bright and amiable lawyer and lifelong friend who ran Mr. Giuliani's campaigns. Like chief executives everywhere, Mr. Giuliani has every right to a trusted confidant. But Mr. Powers, who will run city agencies on a daily basis as the Deputy Mayor for operations, hasn't held a public job since he was a Parks Department intern more than 30 years ago. That means he'll be starting from scratch.
The three other deputy mayors are no more reassuring. Mr. Giuliani has put Ninfa Segarra, a Board of Education member, in charge of health, education and human services. Ms. Segarra has held other city jobs but her record was undistinguished, and none of her positions touched on health and social policy. Perhaps Mr. Giuliani's creation of new positions -- directors of social services, education and health policy -- is meant to address Ms. Segarra's shortcomings.
Still it does not bode well that as a school board member, the volatile Ms. Segarra has put highly emotional and political matters like AIDS education ahead of the broader educational needs of children.
Fran Reiter, the Deputy Mayor for planning and community relations, is a television marketing consultant who was named because she's chairwoman of the Liberal Party, which endorsed Mr. Giuliani's candidacy. John Dyson, Mr. Giuliani's choice for Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, is a former chairman of the State Power Authority and a wealthy investor. But he, like the others, comes with minimal experience in municipal government.
Mr. Giuliani says he doesn't need a powerful deputy because he'll be a hands-on mayor. Good, the city needs an aggressive leader. But no mayor can bury himself in details. Mr. Giuliani would be wise to bring in a seasoned coach to help his team through the early going.

HEADLINE: Salvaging Military Technology

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Wall St.'s Role in Military Conversion" (Viewpoints, Dec. 12), Jon B. Kutler says too little Federal money -- a mere half billion dollars -- has been earmarked to develop civilian products by military contractors. 
 Private capital hasn't been eager to finance these efforts not primarily because of a gap in markets but rather because of military prime contractors' poor record in bringing civilian technologies to market at reasonable prices. The principal reason for this failure lies in the organization of military companies.
Rather than give matching grants to help military contractors diversify and restructure, a more efficient method would be to finance mass transport, environmental and other public authorities to buy technological services and prototypes on a competitive basis.

HEADLINE: A More Accurate Historical Model

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I take issue with Albert Sindlinger's likening the current economy to that of the late 1920's in "Kill-Joy at the Recovery Ball" (Profile, Dec. 12). The debacle after the 1920's was the result of poor distribution of income, a jerry-built system of holding companies, investment trusts and banks and prolonged abdication of political leadership. 
 A more appropriate parallel would be the early stages of the Gilded Age, during which the pace of change in the technology, organization and methodology of economic effort accelerated significantly. From 1866-1897, when the United States achieved economic primacy, the wholesale price index declined 59 percent, industrial wage cuts of as much as 25 percent were common, eight cyclical contractions occurred, labor strife was persistent and deadly and per-capita income distribution became much less equitable.
While the Gilded Age II may not be upon us, we face a future fraught with accelerated change in the economic structure. Displacement and strife will result in proportion to the nature of change and the response of society to its victims.

The Bottom Line

BYLINE: By Erica Abeel; Erica Abeel is the author of "Women Like Us," a novel
forthcoming in February.

 BODY:
Delia has an incredibly active social life. And" -- weighted pause -- "she doesn't even go out with married men." Knowing laughter.
 We had gathered for the monthly meeting of my women's group, a spinoff of the old consciousness-raising groups but harboring no agenda beyond friendship, solidarity and gorging on Chinese takeout. We were laughing at a shared -- and largely unvoiced -- presumption: that single women of middle years who enjoy an active romance frequently enjoy it with someone else's husband. 
Our laughter had a nervous edge. In this room we'd heard no shortage of acid comments on life with a borrowed husband -- accompanied by the inevitable cracks about getting weekends and holidays off. Glancing around the table, I suspected that few of us had eluded the toils of this uniquely tortuous tie, its mix of poisoned pleasures and inequities inevitably leading to the question: How do I get out?
 If my group in any way mirrors the larger world, then affairs with married men must be a flourishing, if sub rosa, concern. My ear has lately picked up the grousing of New York's "weekend widows," the female population deserted from Friday evening to Sunday, when their purloined partners disappear into the bosom of family.
 Affairs with married men are thriving, I suspect, due to a confluence of two groups in need. In today's wobbly economy, most husbands simply can't afford divorce; serial monogamy has become a luxury reserved for billionaires. Yet these same husbands -- for the record, we're talking middle-aged, long married and reasonably well-fixed (partly because they're long married) -- yearn to revive a moribund erotic life. Perhaps they see their last chance to act on the itch for sexual variety, which, says the anthropologist Helen E. Fisher in "Anatomy of Love: The Natural History of Monogamy, Adultery and Divorce," is built into the human male.
 Now consider the army of unattached women of middle years in search of a partner and often overlooked by their male counterparts, who are dipping into a younger pool. Say one of these women connects with a seasoned fellow who wants . . . who wants -- if only he could tell you. Maybe he could tell you over lunch? You then learn, often later than sooner, that he's connected to a wife -- though the link is fraying. Which may explain why you met him at the Yale Club's All Ivy Mixer. Dinners follow; imperceptibly, a divide is crossed. Now you're in over your head.
 Of course, philandering is as old as Zeus chasing nymphs. Yet each period stamps the enterprise with its own tone. The 90's-style affair might be dubbed post-romantic. As life in recession-battered New York grows ever more arduous, relationships not essential to survival are jettisoned in a downsizing of the personal sphere. Friendships wither, especially now that many women, traditionally the social glue, are emulating male workaholism. So the affair, surely a luxury item, is reduced to a tawdry flyby. In the 50's, the straying spouse played a high-stakes, potentially life-altering game; though divorce bore a stigma hard to imagine today, the secretary he was romancing might reasonably expect him to remake his life with her.
 Despite a few notorious exceptions known coast to coast, today's graying philanderer stays married -- an impression supported by a world divorce rate that, according to Helen Fisher, continues to decline after age 30. And he does so without apology: Divorce is not even an issue on the table; fidelity to his marriage, if not his spouse, is a given. Nor is today's wandering husband riddled with guilt. After all, he played it straight and narrow through the sexual revolution; he has Done Well. Isn't he entitled? A paramour is one more perk, along with the company BMW; a jewel in his crown, like his collection of Abstract Expressionists. (One detail consistently overlooked in the Sol Wachtler/Joy Silverman saga was his unwillingness to divorce his wife. The leap from there to his posture of rejected swain cuts the breath.)
 Sometimes the lure of a major life change is dangled. Terry McMillan's novel "Waiting to Exhale" is one long-running joke on the ploys of married men, as when a husband tells his girlfriend, "I just want to see if we could spend some time together, to see if what we have is something we might want to pursue on a more permanent basis." That otherwise discerning women swallow the bait is less amusing.
 Deconstruct the affair from the husband's perspective and his behavior makes a certain sense. A liaison serves him -- if not his lover -- on a variety of fronts. The fellow of conservative bent need not be rousted from 30 years' worth of habits to which he's become welded in middle age. And he preserves what a member of my women's group calls "the corporation": marriage as an association embracing money, real estate, family and social rituals -- what, at the end of the day, has substance and weight. In one's waning years, the upheaval unleashed by changing partners hardly seems worth the aggravation. How a grand passion shrivels when pitted against the house in Santa Fe.
 As a final bonus, in a kind of unwitting synergy between mistress and wife, the affair actually conserves, perhaps even enhances, his marriage. Marital ennui and friction become far easier to tolerate if he knows what pleasures he can access from the nearest car phone. All that's lacking is a proper forum for wives to express their appreciation.
 I suspect that what we're seeing in the 90's-style liaison is nothing less than the death of romantic love. Since its beginnings in the 12th century, romantic love has had a good, long run; now, to judge by my sample affairs, the second millennium may usher it out. I doubt that we will see a new Duke of Windsor anytime soon, because love is no longer at issue. In a culture that venerates money and power, Eros, too, has been eclipsed by commerce. What's pursued is the occasional frisson, a facsimile of passion -- best of all, love without responsibility.
 Recently a friend semi facetiously proposed a Mistress's Bill of Rights guaranteeing the Other Woman a fair share of weekends, holidays and the like. The model might be Victor Hugo, who, like the bon bourgeois he was, equitably parceled himself out between his wife and Juliette Drouet. But that was France. On these shores, women might pull a modern-day Lysistrata and bar the door to all married suitors, on the theory that it's better to do without than deal into piggishness enthroned.
 For my women's group, however, these measures may be superfluous. I suspect that most of us sitting around this table attacking the moo shu pork have already cut our borrowed husbands loose and wished them Godspeed. Or will do so one of these days, according to some mysterious lunar timetable -- soon, soon, any moment now.

HEADLINE: The Value of Music as an Avocation

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
DOES music have "charms to soothe a savage breast"? Robert A. Berman, who has been running a weekly jazz session at his home in Amawalk for the last two years, says the answer is yes.
"In tough economic times like these, people need other outlets more than ever," Mr. Berman said. "What sets my jam apart from all others is the caliber of the musicians who attend. Half are professionals who are among the most talented in the country. The other half are business people who also happen to be excellent players. Both halves agree that playing together helps keep them sane. The result is that some of the best jazz in the metro area is being played behind closed doors simply for the satisfaction of the musicians." 
 Mr. Berman is 49 and a former wine industry sales and marketing executive who gave up a six-figure salary to become a screenwriter. He is the author of "Fade In: The Screenwriting Process." He is also a dedicated guitar player.
"Music, especially jazz, has been a passion of mine since I started playing the guitar at Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains," he said. "I never do anything halfway. In the 60's I was so inspired by James Burton that I hitchhiked across the country to get to California just to meet him. I guess he was so surprised at my story that he agreed to meet me, and we became friends and remain friends. Through him, I met a lot of musicians."
 
Spontaneous Beginning
 Mr. Berman was also acquainted with musicians like himself, those he describes as good but not able to make a living from music.
"Even those at the top say it's a very tough way to earn a living," he said. "Our Thursday night jam sessions are purely for pleasure. Very therapeutic. For a couple of hours, everyone forgets their problems."
Mr. Berman, who has converted a family room into a studio by setting up amplifiers and a public address system, said the jazz sessions began spontaneously.
 
'I Always Get to Play'
 "When I became a screenwriter, I immediately found that writing is solitary work," he said. "I was home alone, 8, 10 hours a day, and I began to feel deprived. At a party one Labor Day, where there were a lot of other musicians among the guests, I suggested that we get together for an impromptu jam session. The following Thursday evening, seven of the musicians showed up. We had a ball, and the pattern was set."
The original group of 7 has grown to a group of 150 musicians; some work in recording studios, and others appear on Broadway, on television and in films.
"Everybody in the group has been auditioned, and there is a lot of talent there," Mr. Berman said. "We draw musicians from all over Westchester and Rockland Counties, but one fellow, Steve Rhian, a guitarist, drives three hours from Providence, R.I., to play. Every week, I rotate the talent, but I always get to play. That's my reward."
Mr. Berman said it takes him about two hours on the phone every week to set up the sessions.
"We start playing at 7:30 in the evening and sometimes go until 1 in the morning, although usually we quit earlier," he said. "Because a lot of the professionals travel so much, they are only around for a couple of months of the year. And it's true that some nights are definitely better than others because some people play better with each other, but since we started we have not missed a week, with the exception of Thanksgiving and Christmas."
The musicians, who range in age from 20 to 60, include veterinarians, craftsmen, middle managers, furniture restorers, doctors and business owners in addition to well-known names in the music world.
"We have Craig Purpura, who plays the tenor sax and the flute and has performed and recorded with Cecil Taylor, and Jeff Tillman, who is another full-time musician -- guitar, bass, vocalist," Mr. Berman said. "Jeff has performed frequently at the Rainbow Room and the Waldorf-Astoria. And there is Fred Smith, another full-time musician, who plays the trumpet and fluegelhorn and is the trumpeter and musical director for the Harlem Blues and Jazz Band. Fred recently recorded two albums with Bernard Purdy and played in the orchestra for the Broadway production of 'Ain't Misbehavin'."
 
Not an Easy Way to Make a Living
 Mr. Berman said the musicians are willing to play purely for recreation because it gives them the opportunity to play in an informal environment. "There's no attitude, no union, no politics or competition they have to contend with," he said. "It's just great music and great fun. And exposure to other musicians can lead to jobs. For instance, a drummer and guitarist who met at the house ended up working together to the advantage of both of them."
Mr. Smith, as music director for the Harlem Blues and Jazz Band, spends much of the spring, summer and fall touring Europe. But when he is home in Ossining, he says he plays with the group every chance he gets.
"The standards are very high," he said. "Those who aren't professional are very gifted amateurs and with them I get an opportunity to play material that I want to rehearse."
Mr. Smith, who emphasized that he never gets tired of playing, said: "I can relax with the group. And I've made some good friends, nice guys with artistic integrity who are committed to making beautiful music. The atmosphere is informal, like jazz clubs used to be. You could sit in and jam and just have a good time."
Another musician in the group, Arnold Evans Schnitzer, electric and upright bass, a former executive recruiter, is also a professional musician who has worked with top performers under the name Arnold Evans. Mr. Schnitzer is the owner of the A.E.S. Fine Instruments Shop in Yorktown, a store that sells and repairs musical instruments. Mr. Schnitzer, a regular Thursday night participant, said the musicians at the jazz sessions have an "unbelievable amount" of talent. "But it's a hard way to make a living as a full-time musician," he said. "Bob Berman provides an outlet for talent, an opportunity to 'keep your chops up.' It becomes very boring to practice alone. At Bob's, you find support and camaraderie."
And Nicholas Misch, a first bass guitarist who attends City College and is Mr. Schnitzer's assistant in the store, said that the jazz sessions have given him an opportunity to sit in with older musicians and learn from them.
"It's a terrific place to get experience and meet people," Mr. Misch said. "And I've gotten some gigs as a result. I performed in some local plays, a jazz gig, a wedding band. I'm definitely making money as a musician through the contacts I've made at Bob's."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Battery Park City;
A New Neighborhood Along the Hudson

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH still under development, Battery Park City, along the Hudson River in lower Manhattan, gives an impression of familiarity. The architecturally diverse residential buildings, set along wide streets and sidewalks edged in cobblestone, are reminiscent of the Riverside Drive area of the Upper West Side.
A third of the 92 acres of Battery Park City consists of parks and open space, including a broad, 1.2-mile-long Esplanade. With Victorian lights, hexagonal asphalt paving blocks and long green wooden benches, the Esplanade offers views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and the New Jersey shore. South of the esplanade is a wooden boardwalk, often crowded with fishermen and lighted at night by cobalt-blue lanterns. 
 The Esplanade also serves as an elegant backyard for the settlers of Battery Park City, who already fill 18 buildings with 4,800 apartments. And only half the building sites are developed. How many residents there will eventually be is uncertain, since it depends on what happens on the unbuilt sites.
Many residents walk to work -- either in the Wall Street area or in the offices and commercial space in Battery Park City itself, most of which is in the 6 million square feet of the World Financial Center, built by Olympia & York.
Launched as an urban-renewal redevelopment by the late Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller in 1966, the land was created by fill and rubble from the excavation for the nearby World Trade Center, dumped amid decrepit Hudson River piers. Following a master plan approved by New York City, the Battery Park City Authority leases out building sites by competitive bid to developers.
Matthew C. Monahan, chief spokesman for the authority, said the neighborhood was meant "to reflect the best of New York City." Its streets are continuations of the old grid, with Chambers, Vesey and other streets extending from the City Hall area into the complex. The idea was to prevent Battery Park City from becoming a separate enclave cut off from the rest of Manhattan by busy West Street on its eastern border.
But West Street is a barrier not easily crossed by foot, and pedestrians usually use the overpasses above it.
"I feel the isolation," said Maria S. Crouch, president of the Battery Park City Owners Association and a six-year resident. "The positive side is that you have a real feeling of community because you get to know your neighbors by spending more time in the neighborhood. The negative part is that you have to walk 10 minutes to some of the subways. So you don't take that much advantage of going to the theater or shopping in the rest of the city."
Mrs. Crouch, a public relations professional for the city, and her husband, Edward, an investment banker, moved from Staten Island six years ago because they felt Battery Park City was "one of the nicest neighborhoods in Manhattan." She still thinks so, but says that shopping options are limited.
Among the major shopping areas, South End Avenue has restaurants, coffee shops, beauty parlors, video stores, banks, two supermarkets and an Asian grocery.
"We need a bakery and some specialty shops and places where you can go for hamburgers and coffee at 2 in the morning," Mrs. Crouch said.
For upscale shopping and restaurants, there are the establishments in and off the 125-foot-high glass-vaulted Winter Garden of the World Financial Center, a performance and exhibition space with 16 soaring tropical palms and a splendid marble grand staircase. In warmer weather there is lunchtime and evening dining just outside on the plaza edging the North Cove Yacht Basin.
A survey by the authority found that 51 percent of the residents worked in the financial district and that a fifth of these were employed in the four-tower World Financial Center at the core of Battery Park City. The average age is 40 and nearly all adults have some college education.
The authority derives its income from World Financial Center rents and leasehold payments by rental-building and condominium apartment owners. The condominium leasehold payments, says Mrs. Crouch, are unfair because they are not deductible from Federal income taxes as is, for example, a share of the interest payments on a co-op's underlying mortgage.
"The authority must re-examine the property status and consider selling the land to the building associations," she says. "The present arrangement makes living here more expensive and makes potential buyers nervous." David Emil, president of the authority, said he sympathized with Mrs. Crouch. Lawyers have been retained to seek an Internal Revenue Service ruling, he said.
The apartments in Battery Park City, which was originally intended as a bedroom community for singles and working couples in the financial district, are mainly studios and one-bedrooms. Just 24 percent have two or more bedrooms. Most of the buildings went up as condominiums, but a substantial number of apartments are renter-occupied.
Prices are determined by square footage and the degree to which a unit faces the Hudson River. "The difference in price between apartments with no view and the same apartment with the best view is about 40 percent," said William Graizel, executive vice president of Regatta New York Realty at 300 Rector Place in Battery Park City.
He said the average two-bedroom apartment overlooking the Statue of Liberty and New York Harbor would sell for about $450,000. A similar apartment with no harbor views would be about $250,000.
One-bedrooms range from about $100,000 to $300,000, Mr. Graizel said, and three-bedrooms from $400,000 to $700,000. The most expensive sale in Battery Park City to date, says Mr. Graizel, was a rare four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath penthouse at 377 Rector Place, which went for $1,875,000 in October.
Rentals range from $1,300 for a one-bedroom with no harbor view to $4,500 for a three-bedroom unit with the best view.
CONTRARY to original expectations, demand for two-bedroom and larger units has been rising. A survey conducted by the Battery Park City Parents Association found that there were more than 580 children in the neighborhood.
Those children and their parents, as well as the public, can take advantage of 30 acres of parkland and large plazas that are maintained in part by a special "facilities fee" of $200 a year assessed to each unit owner.
"I think we have a better community than originally envisioned," said Mr. Monahan. "There is a true reflection of the spectrum of life -- from children to old people. But this is causing a space crunch, both in the apartments and in the schools."
Mr. Emil said his agency was considering plans for two- and-three-bedroom rentals in the northern, so-far-undeveloped section. Some, he said, would be rented at market rates while others might be moderately subsidized.
The Battery Park City Owners Association, however, has come out against building subsididized apartments, saying it would lower the value of existing units.
Among the private developers of Battery Park City is Andrew S. Goodstein, a partner in Goodstein Properties, which built four apartment houses and still retains many of the units as rentals.
"We are interested in more buildings at Battery Park City," Mr. Goodstein said. "The rental market there is extremely strong. There's not much traffic, it's safe and there are lots of parks."
The Parents Association is asking the authority to build a school in Battery Park City. Most of the children attend classes at the already overcrowded P.S. 234 in neighboring TriBeCa. Mr. Monahan says that although the authority would support the construction of a school, the primary responsibility belongs to the New York City school system.
"We think the authority should take more responsibility and fund the school," says Sharyn L. Lawall, who lives in a three-bedroom apartment with her husband, William Dratel, and their three children. "It was poor planning for them to put up this size neighborhood without proper infrastructure."
Ms. Lawall, who is studying for her doctorate in social work at New York University, moved to the neighborhood from Greenwich Village nine years ago. She says that although she loves Battery Park City because it is clean, safe and has a lot of parkland, she might feel compelled to leave if P.S. 234, now 90 pupils over its capacity of 550, becomes any more crowded. Lucy Mahon, staff developer at the school, said the projection for the 1994 school year was 700.
The only school in Battery Park City is the 10-story Stuyvesant High School, opened in September 1992 as the first new high school built in the city in a decade. Entrance to the school, which specializes in math and the sciences and is at the north end of the complex at Chambers and West Streets, is by competitive citywide examination.
Among the high-end restaurants in or near the Winter Garden are the Hudson River Club, Le Pactole and Sfuzzi. Less expensive ones on South End Avenue include Zen (Chinese) and Bankers & Brokers (Italian). Also well-known is Steamers Landing, a seafood and burger restaurant on the Esplanade.
The largest relaxation and recreation area is the 8-acre Hudson River Park, which has a playground, climbing areas and giant tic tac toe boards. Also in the park are a basketball court and handball courts.

HEADLINE: THE WILD WILD EAST

BYLINE: By Bill McKibben; Bill McKibben is the author of "The End of Nature." He
is at work on a collection of articles about environmental hope.

 BODY:
AS HE DROVE ACROSS THE LONGVIEW BRIDGE over the Black River one day in the winter of 1985, David W. Stahle, a researcher at the University of Arkansas, gave a long, low whistle. He had come to the Cape Fear region of North Carolina in search of old trees that he could core for his ongoing climatic research, hoping for specimens as old as the 600- and 700-year-old stands he already knew about on other lonely rivers. What he found along the Black, though, defied every stereotype of the East Coast -- an untouched stretch of river bordered by bald cypresses that dated back at least 1,700 years. "Since one of the characteristics of these old trees is hollowness in the cores, there's no question in my mind that many of those trees are 2,000 years old," Stahle says. And little question that they are the oldest living things in eastern North America, the most venerable organisms this side of the bristlecone pines of eastern California. This place exists as much in time as in place; it was protected by the Washington-based Nature Conservancy in the wake of Stahle's discovery and is now a living museum of natural history -- a kind of Pleistocene park. "These trees -- these very trees -- had Carolina parakeets and ivory-billed woodpeckers in them," said J. Merrill Lynch, a protection specialist at the North Carolina chapter of the conservancy, as we paddled the sleepy river in the spring of 1993. "Now those species are both extinct. We don't want these old-growth forests to go the same way."
 Most of the clamor about old-growth forests has come from the West, where environmentalist pressure to protect remaining large stands of ancient woods brought a halt to logging on many Federal lands and led to President Clinton's timber summit and recent compromise plan designed to protect habitats for endangered species. But biologists and conservationists in the East have recently begun to realize that there is more original forest here than was long believed to be the case, scattered remnants of the mighty forest that greeted the arriving Europeans. These woods seem to harbor no equivalent of the spotted owl, which is dependent on old growth, but scientists argue that their preservation is crucial. The first conference on the topic was convened in August at the University of North Carolina in Asheville, an event that also marked the publication of Mary Byrd Davis's landmark catalogue of the region's untouched woods. Though "old growth" is notoriously hard to define -- there are those who insist on absolute virgin forest, while others make concessions for human intrusion that hasn't altered the basic character of a grove --researchers are becoming more aware of undamaged tracts, and of what can be learned from them. "We have entries from every state in the East," Davis says, "and new discoveries being made all the time. People are just beginning to realize what's out there." 
The first rule when you're looking is to erase the postcard images of grandeur from your mind. Outside the Smokies and the Adirondacks, it's mostly 25 acres here or 50 acres there that by one fluke or another escaped the logger's ax. "We're dealing with little pockets of a landscape that's been totally disturbed, totally utilized," says Charles V. Cogbill, a Vermont ecologist, who has seen as many patches as anyone in the East. Usually, he says, the stands resemble the 20-acre patch of sugar maple, hemlock and yellow birch on Lord's Hill near his northern Vermont home. Though some of the trees are big and old, nothing is more characteristic, says Cogbill, than "old-growth dynamics," the replacement of dead trees by new ones. Wandering through the woods last spring, Cogbill spent as much time looking down as up -- "I'm a deadwood ecologist," he said. "I'm doing autopsies," checking rotting stumps for the progress of decay, looking at new seedlings pushing up through the ground.
 In some places the biology speaks louder than the written history. The historian Barbara McMartin, who next year will publish "The Great Forest of the Adirondacks," says as many as a half million of the park's six million acres may have escaped 19th-century loggers. "It was one man, one horse, one ax -- not really disruptive to the forest," she says. "You never see a stump in those tracts, there's a lot of dead and down trees. It feels old."
 Even in unprotected areas, say many researchers, there's more old growth than the traditional image of the cutover East would suggest. "It was an economically driven forest disturbance," says Stahle. "What that means is, they left a lot of low-end, uncommercial forest in its primeval condition. If you want to find some for yourself, look for harsh places. Look for rough ground."
 For some people even the scrappiest patches of original forest are filled with wonder. Robert Leverett and his son Rob Jr. are amateur old-growth sleuths who are credited with uncovering more ancient patches than anyone else in the East. Only an echoing series of exclamations allows one to track them as they bound down a steep slope above the Cold River in the Berkshire hills of western Massachusetts: "Dad -- over here. This ash is sooo good! This is ancient!" "Look at the bark on this yellow birch, will ya!" Careful researchers, always ready to pull out their tape measures and surveyor's inclines to record widths and heights, they also find their church in these forests. A former Air Force officer who currently teaches statistics and computer science to college students, Leverett is not your typical crystal-gazing New Ager, but he does have a theory: "In a very young wood, that forest is still sucking up energy as it grows, not giving it off. In the older stands, it's more in balance. I end up feeling a little higher. Not in any magnified way, but that balance seems to help the human organism."
EVEN AS SCIENTISTS BEGIN TO SENSE THE richness of eastern old growth, the stands are coming under new threats. Some seem inexorable -- gypsy moth and hemlock woolly adelgid infestations have already wasted some ancient forests. Ozone pollution and acid rain continue to devastate others, and development is always a threat, especially on smaller sites -- one 50-acre Delaware tract will be turned into luxury housing this year, the streets all named for eastern wildflowers.
But if the present is dark, the future could conceivably be brighter. A growing number of biologists are beginning to talk about "future old growth," about forests left to recover from the abusive logging of the past, until in time -- a matter of centuries -- they once again behave like natural forests. Much of the oldest woodland in the Southeast, for instance, is owned by the United States Forest Service, which contracts with private industry to cut timber. More than 60 percent of that national forest is scheduled to be cut at intervals of 60 to 120 years, says Dan Boone, an ecologist at the Wilderness Society -- a rotation much too short to sustain the diversity of the ecosystem. But, says William G. Martin, a Forest Service silviculturist -- silviculture is the science of growing trees -- "there's no question that in the East restoration of future old growth is going to be more important than protecting the little we've already got. It's going to be a major emphasis." Environmentalists have begun to call for a wholesale reappraisal of the role of Federal lands in the East, says Boone, protecting every meager patch of land that's left in order to preserve the region's biodiversity. Gary Miller, director of the environmental studies department at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, envisions the remaining pockets of eastern old growth as seeds for ecological corridors that might someday provide plants and animals with easy travel up and down the mountainous spine of the East. "We're talking about millions of acres, in order to stabilize the population declines that we're seeing," he says.
 In the meantime, small parties continue to scour the woods, weekend after weekend, trying to discover as yet unknown groves of old, old trees in overlooked parts of the East. One day last fall, Bob Leverett led a party out to hike an area near Lewey Lake in the south-central Adirondacks, land that old logging maps showed as devastated. But Leverett, driving down the road, had spotted some telltale craggy trees, and as he climbed higher up the slope he began to grow more excited. "Ooh, that's good," he said, measuring a yellow birch with a circumference of nearly 10 feet, pulling out his clinometer to declare a sugar maple 87 feet tall. Arizonan Dave Forman, a co-founder of Earth First and now a coordinator of the Wildlands Project, is along for the hike. "Even if I saw this back home, I'd say it was a big tree," he says as he pats a massive hemlock, its cinnamon-colored bark putting its age upward of two centuries.
 The day ends under a spruce, on a shaded and mossy hammock by a rushing stream. Leverett Sr. pulls out the surveyor's tools -- the spruce turns out to be exactly 100 feet, top to bottom. "That's a nice tree," says Leverett. "This is a very nice forest."

HEADLINE: U.S. COMPANIES USE AFFILIATES ABROAD TO SKIRT SANCTIONS

BYLINE: By DEAN BAQUET

 BODY:
Seizing on porous laws and lax enforcement of United States sanctions, American corporations have used foreign subsidiaries to conduct business openly with Cuba and Libya, according to documents and interviews.
The rules governing sanctions are so loosely drawn that law enforcement officials have had to abandon or back away from several investigations of American companies suspected of doing illegal business abroad, an examination of some cases shows. 
 The most striking example involves Cargill Inc., one of the world's largest agricultural companies.
 
 
Cargill's Cuban Shipment
 Three years ago, a team of Government agents opened an investigation into charges that Cargill brokered ships loaded with sugar for the Cuban Government, in apparent violation of the Trading With the Enemies Act. In the ensuing months, investigators found hundreds of messages between Cargill and shippers overseas, evidence that executives at the company's headquarters in Minnetonka, Minn., had been involved.
And last year senior Justice Department officials predicted in internal memorandums that an indictment of Cargill, which could cost it hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal subsidies and contracts, was imminent.
Today, however, Government officials acknowledge that Cargill, which denies wrongdoing, may never be charged, even though internal company records leave no doubt that its United States executives helped arrange some of the financing. The company had seized on a loophole in the law that made it virtually impossible to enforce the United States sanctions against multinational corporations: It traded with Cuba through a foreign subsidiary beyond the reach of American law.
 
Companies Avoid Sanctions
 Cargill is one of numerous American companies that have used foreign subsidiaries to trade with countries under United States sanctions, with the profits flowing back home. The trading raises questions about the effectiveness of one of the most visible tools of United States foreign policy.
In January 1986, for example, when President Ronald Reagan ordered sweeping sanctions against Libya, Brown & Root Inc., a Houston engineering concern, pulled out of Libya's $20 billion Great Man-Made River project, which was intended to tap water beneath the desert and create an agricultural oasis. But the company immediately shifted its work, which trade journals valued at an estimated $100 million, to its British subsidiary, Brown & Root Ltd.
Asked if this was done because of the sanctions, Duncan Guy, head of government operations for the British company, said, "Presumably, yes."
The Price Brothers Company, of Dayton, Ohio, a consulting and machinery company, also walked away from the river project when Mr. Reagan, citing evidence that Libya supported terrorism, announced sweeping sanctions. But some work was picked up by Price Brothers (U.K.), the company's small British subsidiary.
Brad Evers, general counsel for Price Brothers, said the British operation got the work on its own and was working on the water project even before sanctions were imposed.
Still, he said, the enforcement on United States companies in Libya has been loose. "A lot of people created foreign subsidiaries in the one month between the time the Reagan Administration declared sanctions and the time they went into effect."
The Coastal Corporation, a Houston oil exploration company, has used a subsidiary based in Bermuda to go into business with the Libyan Government at an oil refinery in Germany.
Coastal has been under Federal investigation for more than three years, law enforcement officials say. But investigators have had trouble determining if executives of the Houston parent are involved in the project, which would be illegal.
Once, Customs Service agents stationed at the Houston airport stopped Coastal's lawyer, Donald Looper, and seized his briefcase when Mr. Looper stepped off a flight from Germany. The agents hoped they could find evidence that Coastal's Houston headquarters was actually calling the shots. Mr. Looper got his briefcase back after an emergency hearing in Federal court in Houston.
 
Loopholes Erode Effectiveness
 Officials of these companies said they did not believe they were violating the spirit of sanctions by doing business with nations the United States sees as its enemies. But some said the loopholes raised questions about the effectiveness of sanctions.
Law enforcement and intelligence officials around the country said they thought that many executives of American companies controlled the work of subsidiaries. But they said murky Federal rules made it tough to build cases. Is it illegal, for instance, for the top executive of a parent to give bonuses for successful work with Libya? Or to share new technology?
"We tell our people that if the subsidiary calls with a question about the Libya contract, just slam down the phone," Edward E. Dyson, a Washington lawyer who has advised Price Brothers and other companies, said.
R. Richard Newcomb, the senior Treasury Department official in charge of enforcing sanctions, said he could not comment on specific investigations, including the Cargill case.
"But forgetting about Cargill or any case," he added, "the U.S. parent may not be involved in any part of the transaction. It is clear. The subsidiary has to be acting totally on its own."
The best estimate of the American corporate presence in Libya was a 1987 study by the Treasury Department. It concluded that 169 foreign subsidiaries of 80 United States companies were doing at least $266 million of trade with Tripoli.
In 1991, subsidiaries of American companies did more than $700 million of trade with Cuba, according to the Treasury Department. The amount has dropped significantly, officials said, because the 1992 Cuba Democracy Act forbids even subsidiaries from doing business with Havana.
International sanctions, like the United Nation's embargoes against Iraq, are hard to evade because so many countries honor them. But the sanctions against Cuba, Libya, Vietnam and North Korea are imposed by the United States alone.
 
The Cargill Deal
Did a U.S. Office Play Middleman?
 The Cargill inquiry shows that it is hard to make cases even when there is ample evidence that United States executives were involved.
Documents examined by The New York Times -- including the same records available to prosecutors -- show significant contact between Cargill and its Swiss subsidiary, Cargill International, involved in selling the Cuban sugar.
A Cargill trader named Eduardo Vigil helped the company's Swiss subsidiary get financing from the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the documents show. In addition, the former vice president of Banca Lavoro's Atlanta office has told investigators that the Cuban sugar transaction was directed by executives at Cargill's headquarters in Minnetonka, with the Swiss unit acting as a front to evade sanctions.
A Cargill spokesman declined to provide detailed comment. Mr. Vigil, who is no longer with the company, did not return phone messages left at his home.
But in a statement to The Times, Cargill said that it had done nothing improper and that it was cooperating with the inquiry.
Cargill, in its statement, also said it had received a special United States license permitting the 1988 Cuban sugar sale, as required by the laws in force at that time. But the license said specifically that American executives would not be involved in the deal.
Privately, the company's lawyers have told the Government that overseas trade is complex, involving many steps by international players, and that it is impossible for United States executives not to play some role in aiding foreign operations.
Cargill's lawyers have not denied the roles of Mr. Vigil and other executives. But in hundreds of pages of legal arguments presented to prosecutors, they have contended that the subsidiary in Geneva dominated the transaction, and that Mr. Vigil and other United States executives had no contact with Cuba.

 The inquiry into Cargill, a fiercely private international trading company run by the same two families for more than 125 years, began with a case unrelated to Cuba or sugar, but with international repercussions of its own.
In the fall of 1989, investigators from several Government agencies interrogated Christopher P. Drogoul, the outgoing banker who ran Banca Lavoro's Atlanta office. Surrounded by a dozen investigators, who were struck by his openness as much as his story, Mr. Drogoul said he made $5 billion in loans to Iraq.
Mr. Drogoul would attract headlines with his claim, never proved, that the loans were made with the approval of the United States Government, which at the time was engaged in a doomed courtship of Mr. Hussein.
Among other statements, Mr. Drogoul recounted what he said were illegal activities by some of the bank's clients, interview transcripts show. Most intriguing to the Government was the tale of Cargill's role in selling Cuban sugar to Venezuela.
By Mr. Drogoul's account, Fritz Baehler, an executive at Cargill's Swiss subsidiary, came to him in 1988 with a crisis. Ships loaded with sugar owned by Cargill, worth $26 million, were ready to sail to Venezuela. But Cargill had to arrange a way for Venezuela to pay for it.
 
A Request for Help
 In such transactions to foreign buyers, suppliers like Cargill typically get paid in advance by an American bank, usually in American dollars. The bank then collects from the foreign buyer. But Mr. Drogoul quoted Mr. Baehler as saying that banks were rejecting Cargill.
Mr. Drogoul said he turned Cargill down upon learning the source of the trouble: Some sugar was from Cuba. Since the Cuban embargo was put in place in 1963, it had been illegal to do most kinds of business with Cuba.
In November 1988, Mr. Drogoul cabled Mr. Baehler, telling him that the company could not get financing from an American bank "given the origin of the merchandise."
Not wanting to upset a valued customer, however, Mr. Drogoul, now serving a 37-month jail sentence for bank fraud, said he asked his bank's Swiss branch to provide financing.
But Mr. Drogoul told the Geneva branch that Atlanta would stand behind the loan and would pay if the Venezuelans defaulted.
 
The Report
A Trail of Dollars Leads to Charges
 By the time the transaction was completed, the Government concluded, Cargill had received American dollars and Mr. Drogoul, at least, had violated the Trading with the Enemies Act.
In an internal memorandum to prosecutors in Atlanta in October 1989, Mr. Newcomb of the Treasury wrote that Mr. Drogoul and his top assistant, Paul Von Wedel, had broken the law and that there were also serious questions about Cargill.
"It is the policy of this office that no U.S. person may be involved with such foreign subsidiary trade, and that payments for Cuban commodities must be in currencies other than U.S. dollars and may not involve U.S. financing," Mr. Newcomb wrote.
"Our Enforcement and Licensing Compliance areas are conducting a separate inquiry into the actions of Cargill Inc. and its Swiss subsidiary which was the beneficiary of the U.S. dollar-denominated letter of credit," he added.
 
Charges of Concealment
 Mr. Von Wedel, in an unpublished book manuscript, insisted that the sugar sale was handled from the United States, with the Geneva branch brought in to conceal American involvement in a transaction with Cuba. Cargill has denied the allegation, insisting the sale was Geneva's.
In making the charge, Mr. Von Wedel described the atmosphere in Banca Lavoro's Atlanta office in 1988, when executives learned that there may have been a violation of United States sanctions.
"Do you know what that means?" he recalled telling a co-worker. The co-worker, Mr. Von Wedel wrote, "looked at me with a real sick look and said, 'Yeah, we just financed Cuban sugar.' "
Mr. Von Wedel said he rushed to Mr. Drogoul's office and insisted that he immediately set up an overseas conference call with Mr. Baehler.
In that call, Mr. Von Wedel said, Mr. Baehler said that the deal was not really his, but that of Cargill's Minnesota headquarters.
Documents reviewed by The Times show that most of the telexes and cables ran through Mr. Baehler's office in Geneva. But the records also show that Mr. Vigil, of the company's headquarters, was deeply involved in the transaction.
More than a dozen cables went to Mr. Vigil's office in Minnetonka, as he negotiated with Banca Lavoro, and tried to get the Venezuelans to repay the Atlanta branch after a currency crisis in Venezuela. It remains unclear if the bank was ever paid.
One cable, marked "Confidential," said it was important that Mr. Vigil help collect from the Venezuelans. A third, dated Nov. 24, 1988, was sent just as the vessel carrying the sugar, the Primrose Island, was to depart from Cuba for Venezuela. It does not clearly refer to Mr. Vigil, but it provides additional evidence of the United States' involvement. The cable said, "Talked to Ed in Miami who said that he would take the responsibility of discharging this vessel."
 
The Indictment
With Infighting, A Case Is on Hold
 On Feb. 28, 1991, the Justice Department announced an indictment of Mr. Drogoul. Tucked inside the 347-count indictment, but receiving scant attention amid charges of multibillion-dollar loans to Saddam Hussein, was a brief mention of the Cuban sugar sale.
Later, the Government listed Mr. Vigil and other Cargill executives in Minnesota and Switzerland as "unindicted co-conspirators."
But at about the same time, two lead agencies in the case -- the Justice Department and the Customs Service, an arm of the Treasury Department -- got into a bitter fight.
Customs, which was responsible for doing the legwork, contended that Justice Department lawyers were not being aggressive enough on Cargill and other sanctions cases.
The fight became heated and at one point the Justice Department asked for an internal investigation of whether Customs agents, in investigating another company, had conducted an illegal search.
Finally, officials of both agencies said, Justice put all of the Customs inquiries, including Cargill, on hold.
The case was revived several months ago when Attorney General Janet Reno formed a new task force.

HEADLINE: Mammogram Debate Moving From Test's Merits to Its Cost

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
With the announcement this month that the National Cancer Institute, a powerful force in the health care debate, would no longer recommend that women in their 40's have regular mammograms, the emotional debate over such precautionary screenings for breast cancer is shifting from a purely medical question to one of cost.
Should insurance companies continue to pay for the tests in younger women, and should President Clinton's health plan hold fast to its proposal to refuse payments for routine mammograms in women under 50? 
 Advocates of such screening, which can spot minuscule tumors in the breast before they can be felt, say they are prepared to let out all the stops in a fight to guarantee insurance payments for routine mammograms in younger women. With a nation "so anguished and angry about breast cancer, it's going to be very difficult to remove this tool," said Amy Langer, executive director of the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations.
But many health economists and planners say the tests for women under 50 should not be subsidized. Further, they warn, if the nation cannot hold firm on this point, there is no hope of ever controlling medical costs.
Dr. David Eddy, a professor of health policy and management at Duke University in Durham, N.C., and a member of the Clinton health care team, said he viewed the mammogram question as a highly visible test case. "If we yield every time there's a constituency that can make an emotional argument for coverage of something that is not supported by actual evidence," he said, "then we will have a chaotic, expensive and inefficient health care system in this country."
 
Inconclusive Evidence
 The cancer institute said that while 30 years of studies had proved that mammograms save the lives of women over 50, those same studies did not prove that early detection saved the lives of younger women. The institute said that rather than recommend that women in their 40's either have or not have the test it would lay out the data and let each woman decide for herself.
Some groups, like the American College of Radiology and the American Cancer Society, agree that mammograms have not been proven to save the lives of younger women. But, they argue, the studies so far have not conclusively ruled out a potential benefit, and so it is not correct to say that mammograms are useless in younger women. These groups continue to recommend regular screening mammograms for women in their 40's.
Still, the National Cancer Institute's action gave the question of cost new impetus: If the principal cancer research institute was declining to recommend screening, should insurers and health maintenance organizations continue to pay for it?
Dr. Larry Kessler, the chief of the applied-research branch at the cancer institute, said that a mammogram cost an average of $100 and that five million women in their 40's had them in 1990, for a total cost of half a billion dollars.
 
The Cost of Screening
 Using available data, he said a conservative estimate would be that about 94 percent of the tests were normal. But 6 out of every 100 women who had mammograms, or 315,000 women, were called back for an additional mammogram or sonogram to look more closely at suspicious areas. That, Dr. Kessler said, added, conservatively, $31 million to the mammogram bill. Of those who had these additional tests, he said, at least 46,000 had to have biopsies, at a cost of $2,000 to $3,000 each, adding $92 million to $138 million to the bill. Those biopsies detected about 13,500 cancers, or 0.27 percent of women in their 40's who were screened with mammograms.
Insurance companies as a group do not take a position on the merits of the test, said Richard Coorsh, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association of America. Instead, he said, insurers "respond to the market demand or the demand of state legislators," providing coverage for the tests only when customers ask for it or the law requires it.
Jeanne Casey, editor of the Health Benefits Newsletter, based in Alexandria, Va., said 42 states had laws requiring insurance companies to pay for mammograms for women in their 40's.
 
Passionate Arguments
 Those who believe the tests save lives, even if the proof is not at hand, argue passionately that women will die if the examinations are not subsidized. "We're just terrified, frankly, that we will backslide," Ms. Langer said.
Dr. Sarah Fox, an associate professor of family medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles, said that not paying for the tests would, in particular, penalize poor women, who are already underserved. She has made surveys of women and doctors that showed that the cost of mammograms was the leading reason why many women did not have them.
"Shouldn't we rather be safe than sorry?" asked Dr. Fox, who believes that younger women should be screened. She said that more affluent women would continue to have the tests while poorer ones would not if insurance stopped paying for them. "We will be enforcing a two-tier medical system," she said. "That's the direction we wanted to get away from in the Clinton health system."
 
Holding Firm
 But Dr. Ann Flood, a health policy analyst who directs the Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., said that now, more than ever, was a time for health policy planners to hold firm. Mammography has not been shown to be beneficial in younger women, she pointed out. Moreover, the test has drawbacks, including the need for biopsies to check anomalies that ultimately turn out not to be cancerous. As a result, she said, the right to have the test paid for "seems like a hollow right" for younger women. "If we cannot show that something is beneficial, we should not pay for it," Dr. Flood said. She added that the mammography debate would test the national will to go forward with health care reform.
Dr. Arleen Leibowitz, a health care economist at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., said the nation could not ignore the cost of tests whose benefits were unproven. "We are beginning now to step back and ask, 'How do we want to spend these dollars that are partly public dollars?' " she said. "It's sad to say, but there are some things that as a society we cannot do."
 
No Cost Justification
 But even for women over age 50, Dr. Eddy said, where routine mammograms can cut the death rate from breast cancer by as much as a third, there is no way to justify them on a cost basis. He said that health planners rightfully endorsed insurance coverage for the tests in older women not because they saved money but because they saved lives. But, he emphasized, the life-saving benefits themselves are not established for younger women.
The conclusion that mammography screening of women over age 50 does not save money "might seem paradoxical," Dr. Eddy said. He explained that the problem was that thousands of older women "who don't have and never will have breast cancer" must be screened to find one woman who does. "By the time you take into account all the exams for all the women and all the biopsies for all the false positives, you overcome the potential savings by a factor of 10," he said. "It's not even close."
But Ms. Langer said: "As a breast cancer advocate, I can't be convinced by economics. Many of us had our breast cancer detected on mammograms when we were under age 50. It's hard not to be personal about this."
Advocates for women with breast cancer are ready to fight, she added. "What you have now is a very powerful group of women who are extremely angry and frustrated that very little is known about breast cancer," Ms. Langer said. "Women will not stand for the government or others to try to take away the only tool we have that is a proven intervention. Maybe it's not good enough, but it's the best we have."

HEADLINE: Job-Training Program Is Seen as U.S. Model

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
Wearing safety glasses and a white lab coat, Christian Kittrell uses tweezers to pick away grains of dirt until an exact gram of soil remains on the scale. Next he will dry the sample in an oven, weigh it again and calculate its moisture content. Then he will break the sample down looking for nitrates, sulfates and phosphates.
Christian is conducting an experiment in hazardous-waste analysis, and in a much larger sense an experiment in the future of American education. 
 A 15-year-old sophomore, he is one of 242 students in the Environmental Technology Academy at Abraham Lincoln High School, one of nine high school programs in Philadelphia with special job-training curriculums.
"I get up about 5:30 to get here by 7:15 for my first class at 7:20," said Christian, who lives with his mother, a secretary, in Northeast Philadelphia. Lazy in junior high, he said, he is now on the honor roll and taking English, Spanish, geometry, health and two environmental-science courses. "I love it here," he said.
 
Schools Within Schools
 The Philadelphia academy system, the country's oldest and biggest program linking work and scholarship, serves as a model for those who say the United States has to do a better job of educating high school students who do not plan to go to college.
The Clinton Administration is spending $100 million to help states and communities plan programs to help prepare students for jobs in the changing economy. The Philadelphia system is "very much in the context of what we want to do," said Leslie Loble, a special assistant to Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich.
The academies here are schools within schools. In addition to their vocational classes, the students take regular academic courses, where teachers try to connect their subjects to the academy's specialty and to relate the lessons to the world at large.
About 4,300 students are enrolled, out of Philadelphia's high school population of 45,000. The school district still has jurisdiction over them and provides the teachers and classrooms but has turned over management to an independent organization, Philadelphia High School Academies Inc., which is financed and supervised by local businesses. These businesses spend $1.5 million a year to cover the cost of the academies' special services, and volunteer executives oversee operations.
 
Ambitions Are Developed
 Most students in the academies fit into a category that educators call the forgotten half, those prone to dropping out, to drifting from school to unemployment and welfare. Sixty-nine percent are classified as economically disadvantaged.
Once in an academy, however, many join the fortunate half. Graduates who were supposed to march off to work develop other ambitions. "I'm going to college," Christian Kittrell said. "I'm going to be a chemical engineer."
Fifty-four percent of the 1992 academy graduates went to college. (Comparable figures for other 1992 Philadelphia high school graduates are not available because the district does not follow up on its students.) Because of their success, the academies have begun to attract strong, well-off students, not just the poor or unmotivated.
"The academies consistently show themselves with higher passing rates in the core academic subjects, like English, math and science, and higher attendance rates, at all grade levels," said David Hunt, the school district's executive director for accountability and assessment.
About 10 percent of the students quit to return to the regular schools. But only 4 percent drop out of school entirely, half the annual rate in the overall school district.
 
Special Characteristics
 Richard Kazis, head of Jobs for the Future in Cambridge, Mass., a nonprofit research organization, attributes the academy system's appeal to the way it ties subjects like chemistry and math to everyday life. "It keeps people moving forward," he said. "Now, people talk about this kind of learning for all students."
Each academy is a little universe of teachers, students and employers. The academic teachers are paid an average of $600 a year for the extra work of relating their courses to the practical world. Science and math teachers in the environmental program, for example, will try to link their subjects to the chemistry and measurement of pollution. And an English teacher will read a student's environmental-sciences paper for grammar.
Most of the Clinton Administration's school-to-work programs emphasize apprenticeships, in which students spend part of their school year being paid while learning skills as they work. In November, the House of Representatives approved the Administration's School-to-Work Opportunities Act, providing $300 million a year to help underwrite academy, apprenticeship and other job-related programs, and the Senate is expected to follow early in 1994. After the seven years, Ms. Loble said, the Federal support for the programs would stop, with the most successful ones running on their own, as Philadelphia's does now.
 
Limited Support
 The very success of Philadelphia's system has created some problems. With more qualified students competing for places, the least-promising applicants are being turned away. And most business supporters are saying they have reached their limit in what they can contribute to the program.
So the academies face a dilemma. They would like to expand, but they cannot without relying on public money, which would invite government intervention and compromise their independence. Keeping the government out, said Natalie Allen, president of Philadelphia High School Academies, has been the key to the programs' operation. "We're becoming victims of our own success," she said.
The program started small 24 years ago with an electrical academy, strictly to teach a trade. But in the last five years, it has expanded rapidly.
The nine academies, some with multiple branches, operate in 17 high schools. They specialize in health professions, law, physical education, office practices, hotel and restaurant management, electrical technology, automotive repair, as well as environmental technology and horticulture. In contrast to the specialized magnet schools in other cities, including New York, the academies here are independent of the school system.
Graduates who do not go to college often say that they have an advantage in the shrunken job market. Michael Adams, 19, left the horticulture academy in June and was hired immediately by a hospital groundskeeping crew.
He said he had an edge in his job because he knew how to use landscaping tools and to calculate how much grass seed and shrubbery were needed. He was recently promoted. "I started at $6 an hour," he said, "and I just got raised to $10.35."
The business leaders who oversee the academies meet with teachers and managers in planning courses. They provide materials and invite the students in for mock job interviews, as well as contribute the money that covers the additional $370-per-student cost of the academies' services. Some businesses provide part-time jobs.
"It's great if they learn about environmental technology," said Robert Fox, a lawyer who is chairman of the environmental academy. "If they want to use it in their work, that's fine. But the great effect, the real benefit, is in giving students a focal point. It gets them turned on to education."
Saudia Cunningham, who graduated from the environmental academy in the spring, would agree. For her, getting to the academy was an hourlong grind, and the work seemed beyond her. While in school, she lived on welfare with her mother and sister.
"I had family troubles," Ms. Cunningham said. "My father died when I was a baby. In the beginning, I was trying to get out of it. But they got tutors for me, and when I came back for my sophomore year, I was determined to do better."
She entered science fairs and started winning prizes. One summer, she found a clerical job with the regional Environmental Protection Agency office. She is a now a freshman on a full scholarship at Florida A & M University. "If I wasn't in the academy, I wouldn't have found where my heart really is," she said.
 
Factory Jobs Disappear
 In Philadelphia, as in much of the country, stable and reasonably well-paying jobs have been disappearing with the contraction of the manufacturing companies.
But Gretchen Betz, a staffing manager at Rohn & Hass, a large chemical company here, said that she still hired a few office academy graduates and that they had an edge on other students.
"It's their work attitude and to some extent their skills," she said. "They're basically familiar with business, with office practices, office machines, business math," she said. But she said that the skills of entry-level jobs were constantly rising, and that the new jobs required a level of competence few academy graduates could meet without some college.
By including college preparatory courses in the curriculum, the program's early stigma as vocational schools has vanished, managers say. As a result, student demand for places in some academies exceeds capacity.
A lottery is used to select students for the 75 freshman places in the environmental academy. Only applicants with B averages and good behavior and attendance records are considered. The health academy excludes applicants who finish below the top 60 percent on citywide exams in subjects like reading and math.
 
Competition Is Increasing
 That dismays Ms. Allen, the academies' president, and others here. Roger Meyer, Christian Kittrell's lab teacher, worries that the selection process is keeping out students he thinks the program should be doing most to help: "the kids who were dead-ended."
"We had kids who were in danger of dropping out," he said. "We were able to turn a lot of them around."
The Philadelphia school system is trying to meet the added demand for work-related education by creating other schools-within-schools.
But because businesses say they can only afford to support the original academies, the new programs are managed by the district and lack the academies' connection to local employers.
Whatever the problems, Philadelphia is still reaching more poor students with work-related schooling than any other city.

HEADLINE: Late Sales Lift Results For Stores

BYLINE: By JOSHUA MILLS

 BODY:
When the nation's retailers locked their doors Friday evening after a 29-day holiday season that began the day after Thanksgiving, many were relieved that a late surge of shopping would produce modestly respectable sales figures.
"It was explosive the last few days before Christmas," said Walter F. Loeb, a consultant in New York who works with leading retailers. "Customers were rushing to the stores." 
 Kenneth A. Macke, the chairman and chief executive of the Dayton Hudson Corporation in Minneapolis, said, "I feel better after this week than I did any of the preceeding weeks."
Statistical data are hard to come by right after Christmas, because different companies compile information for different periods and none are inclined to release precise numbers until the new year.
Rough estimates of year-to-year increases in holiday sales provided by store executives ranged from 7 to 9 percent at Sears, Roebuck & Company to 2 to 3 percent at Federated Department Stores, whose properties include Bloomingdale's, which did considerably better, but also Abraham & Straus, Jordan Marsh, Burdine's, Rich's and Stern's.
 
Not Always Easy
 But even where sales were strong, they were not always easily achieved. Mr. Macke said he had never seen so much pre-Christmas price-cutting and promotions, which cut into profit margins, in his 30 years in the retailing business.
And Duncan Muir, a spokesman for the J. C. Penney Company, of Dallas, confirmed that view. "With a lot of people shopping at last minute, we prepared for that with many special promotions," he said.
If this holiday season were a drawing, it would look like a hammock -- high sales right after Thanksgiving and right before Christmas, with two sagging weeks in between. Beyond that, it is hard to find patterns.
Across the industry, home furnishings and small appliances had a very good season, executives and consultants said, but clothing did not. That trend was bad news for many stores, because apparel provides a large chunk of their business, and also higher profit margins than many other goods. Bloomingdale's and Sears, however, were pleased with their apparel sales.
"All our sweaters, particularly cashmere," did very well, said Michael Gould, the president of Bloomingdale's, while cosmetics and housewares also had strong seasons.
Ann Barkelew, a spokeswoman for Dayton Hudson, said that while sweaters also did well at their stores, "the home area was definitely stronger than apparel," adding, "So was holiday motif merchandise, like novelty ties for men and fashion watches with a Christmas tree decoration that also play carols."
Two particularly strong items, she said, were Disney-related goods and the new Mont Blanc pen, called the Hardwriter, which "sold like wildfire" despite its price of $165 to $185.
One surprise was that shoppers in California seemed to hold their own with those elsewhere in the United States, even though that state's economy continues to struggle and tens of thousands of workers have been laid off in military contracting and other industries.
"We had questions about the West Coast, but our performance in the West was comparable to the rest of country," said John Costello, senior vice president at Sears, Roebuck & Company's merchandise group. And Mr. Macke of Dayton Hudson said, "California was equally busy as the rest of the chain."
 
Making the Estimates
 Looking at their computers, most executives were able to come up with estimates of how they had done.
Mr. Macke, whose stores include Dayton's, Hudson's, Marshall Field's, Mervyn's and Target, said he expected sales for December to show an increase over last year's figures of "low to mid-single digits" in percentage terms.
Mr. Muir of J. C. Penney said sales for the season were likely to grow by "mid-single digits," while Mr. Costello of Sears was more sanguine, predicting that sales would rise roughly 7 to 9 percent, bolstered by double-digit gains in some departments, including consumer electronics and tools.
Wall Street analysts who follow the retailing industry have generally predicted that apparel sales nationwide, among stores open at least a year, would rise no more than 3 percent during the holiday season, while sales of home furnishings, small appliances and electronics would rise as much as 8 percent.
The International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group in New York whose members include shopping center owners and managers, had predicted that holiday sales of home furnishings would rise 20 percent from last year's.
From the day after Thanksgiving until last Monday, the council said, sales at the nation's malls rose 4.4 percent. Presumably those numbers will be pushed up when the frenzy of the final week is added in.
Stores "were opening up at 7 or 8 in the morning and closing at midnight to catch any business they could the last week," said Mr. Loeb, the consultant.
The most optimistic assessment of the holiday season came from Michael Gould, president of Bloomingdale's. "We've had a very good month so far," he said Friday evening. "Friday looked strong, Thursday we had double-digit gains compared with last year, and last Saturday was colossal."
Among the best-sellers, he said, were housewares, cosmetics and sweaters. At Bloomingdale's flagship store in midtown Manhattan, he said apparel, especially men's wear, was selling better than at other Bloomingdale's stores.
Asked what a good holiday season portends for the new year, Mr. Gould admonished: "You never look ahead at Christmas. Is the customer overextending, or will they be so sated we don't need anything special in the first quarter? I can't tell."

Companies
American corporations have openly conducted business with Cuba and Libya through foreign subsidiaries, according to documents and interviews. The rules governing sanctions are so loosely drawn that United States law enforcement officials have had to abandon or back away from several investigations of companies suspected of doing illegal business abroad, an examination of some cases shows. The most striking example involves Cargill Inc., one of the world's largest agricultural companies. [Page A1.] 
 Change is sweeping the gas station industry with such intensity that station owners, fuel company executives and local distributors seem to have lost their way. Struggling with shrinking profits in their core gas station business, they are striving for profitability by creating some odd hybrids, including gas stations that sell flowers or offer dry cleaning services and those where customers can get tacos but not a tire change. [D1.]
The number of former Prudential Securities clients who are likely to get compensation for claims involving fraud in the sales of partnerships continues to shrink. [D1.]
Viacom's Sumner Redstone could raise the capital to raise his offer for Paramount, but if he did he could face costly hurdles from his equity partners and Paramount's board. [D7.]
 
The Economy
A late surge in Christmas shopping produced modestly respectable sales figures for retailers. Rough estimates provided by store executives ranged from a gain of 7 to 9 percent at Sears to 2 to 3 percent at Federated Department Stores. [D1.]
 
International
A Mexican company with a rocky past has made the first major cross-border acquisition in the new era of free trade among the United States, Canada and Mexico.[D1.]
Japan's production and exports of consumer electronics products are shrinking rapidly. Even as giants like Sony and Panasonic continue to lead the world in such products, the "made in Japan" label is becoming harder to find as manufacturing shifts to countries with lower wages. [D1.]

Splashes and Growth at The American Spectator

 BODY:
The American Spectator made a publicity splash two years ago with an article entitled "The Real Anita Hill," in which it questioned the motives and character of Clarence Thomas's accuser. Then it seemed to disappear, only to return with a vengeance last week with "His Cheatin' Heart," which contends that President Clinton used Arkansas state troopers to help him conduct what it called adulterous affairs while he was governor.
In fact, the aggressively conservative journal has enjoyed rapid growth in the last two years; it says its circulation has increased sevenfold since January 1992, to more than 200,000.
 
'What Is Really Going On'
 
 "People are turning to us because they are living in a culture polluted with someone else's preferences, tastes and perspectives," R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., the 50-year-old editor of The Spectator, said. "The White House and the major editorial boards are trying to sell a vision of America that does not exist, and so people are turning to our magazine to learn what is really going on." 
 Mr. Tyrrell, who founded The Spectator in 1967 while he was a student at Indiana University, traces his magazine's growth to an overhaul two years ago. He punched up the content, blending more topical and hard-hitting articles with its musings on Keynesian economics and the decline of Western civilization. And, he said, "We began running more investigative pieces on people and issues that our readers feel are slanted by the mainstream media."
 
Critics, Left and Right
 But critics contend that the magazine merely apes the conventions of objective reporting to appear fair-minded. "They go on about how they spend months during dozens of interviews for their stories, but they don't have any of the scrupulousness about facts of serious investigative journalists," said Michael Kinsley, a senior editor of The New Republic and the liberal co-host of CNN's "Crossfire." "They are untrustworthy, though I wouldn't say everything they print is wrong. Even a stopped watch is right twice a day."
Conservatives have also criticized The Spectator, especially for the near pornographic detail in the Clinton article. "I've never seen this kind of detail in a respectable magazine," said Patrick J. Buchanan, the former Presidential candidate who is now a conservative syndicated columnist. "This is the kind of stuff that used to be confined to the supermarket tabloids. It's very lurid and lewd, and I think it's degrading to the national debate on issues like Nafta and health care, which is where we ought to be putting our energies."
Writers for The New Yorker magazine and other publications found that The Spectator's March 1992 article on Anita Hill, which portrayed her as a love-scorned left-winger, included important errors. The writer of the Hill and Clinton articles, David Brock, has acknowledged errors while defending his work.
Mr. Tyrrell, justifying the article in a way that would not be acceptable at most serious newspapers and magazines, said, "there were mistakes in those pieces; in fact I'm surprised there were so few." He called them minor.
He said his critics "know the main point is true, that Clinton abused his power, so they try to chip away at the periphery so they can say, 'See, they can't be trusted.' "
One of the state troopers quoted in the article has since denied a key allegation -- that President Clinton had specifically offered him a job to remain silent. Two other troopers have admitted that they lied about wrecking a police car while intoxicated in 1990. These facts, which could raise doubts about their credibility, were never mentioned in The Spectator.
 
A Lift From Limbaugh
 Criticism about accuracy has not put off new subscribers, many of whom have learned about the magazine through Rush Limbaugh on his radio and television shows. "Our ads on his programs have been very effective," Ronald Burr, publisher of The Spectator, said. "And when he mentions one of our articles, that's like gold. We would certainly be growing without him, but he is like kerosene on the fire."
Many conservative magazines are enjoying impressive circulation gains. During the last 18 months, National Review's circulation has grown from 161,000 to nearly 250,000; Conservative Chronicle, a sort of Reader's Digest of conservatism, has almost doubled its circulation, to 92,000, and a monthly newsletter begun a year ago by Mr. Limbaugh now has 375,000 subscribers.
The advance of conservative magazines since Mr. Clinton's election mirrors the rise of liberal publications during the Reagan era. Victor Navasky, editor of The Nation, said his magazine began the 1980's with 20,000 subscribers and ended the decade with about 100,000.
"The mainstream press tends to amplify the message of the 'ins,' which makes the 'outs' feel alienated," Mr. Navasky said.
But The Spectator is still not in the black. Like most political magazines, it draws little revenue from advertisers, who traditionally shun magazines that take sides. The Spectator said its recent growth, however, had brought it tantalizingly close to break-even.
"We could keep rising higher than we ever thought, or drop, boom," Mr. Burr said. "But either way, we'll stay right where we are."

HEADLINE: Fill It Up? Send a Fax? Have a Taco?

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
When the Shell Oil Company wanted to build a gas station in Pembroke Pines, Fla., residents of a retirement community balked. They insisted that the huge new station could not go in unless Shell included a post office in the plans. Three years later, the residents got their way.
Shell was not wild about the idea. Indeed, in Houston, it is ripping out a post office from one of its new gas stations. "People did not buy enough," explained William Heyd, Shell's national manager of marketing and advertising. "We're taking the post office out and putting in fast food." 
 Change is sweeping the gas station industry with such intensity that station owners, oil company executives and local distributors seem to have lost their way. Struggling with shrinking profits in their core gas station business, they are trying to mix and match their way to profitability, creating some odd hybrids: gas stations that sell flowers or offer dry cleaning services and stations where customers can get tacos but not a tire change.
"People are experimenting to try to find the best combination," said Jack Howe, the vice president of marketing for the Phillips Petroleum Company. "What we're all looking for is to offer a better package of services."
What they often end up with, however, are combinations that are taking the industry into unfamiliar businesses while blurring the traditional role of selling gas and servicing cars.
The Mobil Corporation, for example, is experimenting with a combination gas station and McDonald's in Naples, Fla., and is planning to do the same with Burger King in Chicago. The company said it was also talking with Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.
Other companies are experimenting with service counters, where customers can use a copier or fax machine, drop off a parcel for United Parcel Service or Federal Express, rent a video, get clothes cleaned, wire flowers, have a gift wrapped, send a money order or have business cards printed. Many of these new services are included in superstations, where there are scores of gas pumps and a convenience store stocking thousands of items.
Ashland Oil Inc. is one of the biggest operators of superstations through its Superamerica subsidiary. Because the company no longer explores for oil and buys most of its oil on the market, Ashland has tied its fortunes to its retail operations. Ashland has built 626 of the huge combinations in the last 20 years. But are these still gas stations?
"We prefer to call them retail profit centers," said John F. Pettus, who runs the Superamerica unit. Even the superstations have had to pull in their horns, however, selling 51 stores in Florida and 26 in Montana this year because the stores were not close enough to buy their gasoline from Ashland refineries.
Changes in environmental regulations, technology and buying habits have prompted the shift by gas stations to new retailing combinations. But the recent sharp drop in crude oil prices, which has pushed down prices at the pump, has accelerated the move.
 
'It's a Tough, Tough Business'
 "I've seen gas prices at 86 cents a gallon in Tulsa," said Wayne W. Allen, president and chief operating officer of Phillips, which is based in Bartlesville, Okla. "It's a tough, tough business."
Bargain-basement gasoline prices could not have come at a worse time for the nation's 170,000 stations. Stringent environmental regulations, which must be in effect by 1998, are forcing many stations to replace storage tanks and often pumping equipment. In some metropolitan areas, stations must also add new hoses and nozzles to control fumes emitted during pumping.
A recent survey by the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, which represents about 40,000 distributors, found that the average cost of compliance is about $133,000 for a station this year. Stations in metropolitan areas face additional costs of about $40,000 each for the new hoses and nozzles.
"These are enormous costs for a small business," said Phillip R. Chisholm, the association's executive vice president.
Bob Edgar, who owns Service Oil in Colby, Kan., with 20 stations, said, "It's very difficult." Mr. Edgar, who has been in the business for 40 years, has spent about $500,000 a year for the last five years to renovate his stations. He has gone heavily into debt and has already shut six stations because they were too small to renovate. Yet his company earns only about $200,000 a year, he said.
"I'm happy to turn this over to someone else," he said. He plans to retire in 1994.
 
 
Environmental Liabilities
 Many stations cannot get loans to finance the cleanup because banks have been reluctant to lend money to an industry that can face major liabilities from leaks and spills. Many smaller stations facing conversion have also found it difficult to get insurance because of potential cleanup costs.
Most states, however, now have insurance funds to help finance cleanups when stations discover leaks from old tanks and contaminated soil or underground water. The state generally pays off if station owners can show they were not negligent and were in compliance with earlier regulations.
All of this makes it tougher for station owners to sell their businesses. And even closing up is costly, averaging about $36,000 a station, mainly for cleanup.
Clearly, the economics of the gas station industry have changed sharply. As gas stations offer more bells and whistles, many are cutting back on the basic services that used to be routine, like checking the oil or doing a minor repair. Full-service stations, where attendants pump gas, look under the hood and clean the windshield, are a dying breed.
"The old person-to-person relationship has changed," said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of The Lundberg Letter, which tracks gas stations. "Everyone is trying to roll with it."
 
 
Specialization in Car Service

 
Specialized chains, which install mufflers, change the oil, take care of tires and perform tuneups, have stepped in to fill the void.
Mr. Heyd, who oversees marketing at Shell's 4,000 stations, says the gas station business is undergoing fragmentation just as the medical world is. Car owners, he said, like medical patients, must increasingly go to high-priced specialists even for simple procedures.
In the gas station industry, the costs of converting stations so they will comply with Federal regulations are so high -- and the profit margin so thin for gas sales -- that many stations are trying to add more profitable services.
But the experimentation is leading the industry -- which is used to finding oil, refining and then selling the end products -- into unfamiliar territory.
When the oil industry, retailing and fast-food industries started to get together, noted Stephen Montgomery, vice president of gasoline marketing for the Amoco Corporation, "we each lacked knowledge about each other's universe."
 
 
Looking for the Right Mix
 He said Amoco had to do much fine-tuning and experimenting to make the combination of stores and stations work on one lot. One challenge has been to figure out the right mix so that customers will look at the combination as a retail unit and not just a gas station. The goal, he said, is to win customers who "buy gas on Tuesday and come back and just buy milk on Saturday."
But companies are struggling to find ways to do that without diluting their core business of selling gas.
This has led to many conflicting strategies. Many stations, for example, are trying to increase their gas business by putting in payment dispensers, machines at the pump that take credit cards so that drivers can pay without getting out of their cars.
But these dispensers are often installed at stations attached to convenience stores, whose profits depend on drivers getting out of their cars and buying, often on impulse, high profit-margin items like soda and cigarettes. Indeed, in recent years, convenience items have become an increasingly important source of profits at gas stations, and some in the industry worry that the new machines will erode this revenue stream.
 
 
Women Like Dispensers
 But the dispensers serve a very important constituency. "At least half the buyers are women now," said Stephen Pryor, the vice president and general manager of fuels marketing at Mobil. "Twenty years ago, it was about one third."
Women, particularly those with children, he said, have prompted Mobil to install these dispensers. "Without leaving your car or the kids," he said, "you pump your gas and pay on the spot."
By the end of the year, he said, 2,000 of the 3,500 stations in which Mobil has an ownership stake will offer new dispenser systems, which take the major credit cards and even some bank cards. Although the dispensers may cut traffic in the convenience stores, Mobil must make them available to keep its bread-and-butter gas sales, he added.

HEADLINE: Mexican Truck Maker Heads to New Destinations

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 26

 BODY:
Four years ago, the Government got rid of a state-controlled company that lost $25 million a year turning out smoky buses and trucks that could barely climb Mexico's mountains.
That same company, Consorcio Grupo Dina, is now operated by a team of businessmen and has an annual profit of $90 million on a new line of trucks and buses. It is one of five Mexican companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Three weeks ago it announced a preliminary agreement in the United States market with the acquisition of Motor Coach Industries International of Phoenix, the largest bus manufacturer in the United States, in a stock deal worth $336.6 million.
It surprised many analysts that a Mexican company -- especially one with a rocky past -- made the first major cross-border acquisition in the new era of free trade among the United States, Canada and Mexico.
 
A Precarious Position
 Because Motor Coach Industries has operations in Canada, the acquisition creates one of the first new North American companies since the North American Free Trade Agreement was approved in Washington, and indicates that Mexican businesses are hardly waiting to be acquired by American companies once Nafta takes effect on Saturday.
The deal also reflects the precarious position that even strong Mexican companies face because of uncertainty over the value of the Mexican peso and the anemic performance of the Mexican economy, which in the last quarter declined 1.2 percent from the period a year earlier.
Analysts say it makes sense for a company like Dina to make major purchases now because a devaluation of the Mexican peso is possible in 1994 and would make any foreign acquisition more difficult and more costly. They also say that while diversifying across borders should be beneficial in the long run, it could weaken the company next year because it will divert resources at a time when growth in the Mexican economy -- on which companies like Dina greatly rely -- will continue to be restrained.
"This deal will probably hurt the short-term outlook for the company," said Jorge Garza, an analyst with Vector, a financial services company in Mexico City. "In the long run, though, Dina is pursuing a diversification of its market that will help it avoid the kind of contraction it has suffered this year by relying only on the internal market."
By most counts, Dina is one of the success stories of Mexico's ambitious program to get the Government out of business. Since 1987, Mexico has sold off or shut down nearly 1,000 state-run businesses.
Diesel Nacional, the forerunner of Grupo Dina, was formed by the Government and Italian private investors in 1951, and for years was run without much attention to efficiency or service. The Mexican market was effectively closed and buyers had little choice but to take the underpowered, poorly designed trucks that Dina sold.
In 1989, a group of Mexican investors bought the company from the Government for $232 million. The package included Dina's medium- and heavy-duty truck operations, as well as the company's urban transit and long-distance bus plants.
Ernesto Moya Pedrola, 47, was recruited from a Mexico City financial services firm and made director general. His strategy for turning around the company had three thrusts -- productivity, strategic alliances and assembly.
"There are no magic wands," Mr. Moya said. "What we're looking at is more volume, smaller margins, more efficiency and more competition."
In May, the company signed a new contract with its 4,900 employees that based promotions on merit rather than seniority, and included productivity incentives of the type that the Administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari now proposes.
Productivity gains are obvious. In 1988, the last full year under state control, the company made and sold 2,967 trucks. With roughly the same number of employees, this year it will assemble and sell more than 12,000.
Since 1989, the company has also entered several strategic alliances. One of the most important is with Navistar, the maker of International trucks in the United States, which owns 17.5 percent of Dina's truck operations.
 
A Brazilian Connection
 Dina now sells essentially the same truck in Mexico as Navistar sells in the United States. Each company has agreed not to cross the border and sell in the other's territory.
Dina's bus operations have affiliated with the Brazilian manufacturer Marcopolo.
Since 1990, when the Mexican Government lifted regulations on bus fares, a new segment of the intercity bus business has opened with air-conditioned, luxury buses. Dina has a 49 percent market share of the intercity bus market and an even higher share of the new first-class segment, according to a Salomon Brothers report on Dina that was published in October.
The third arm of Dina's strategy was to switch from manufacturing its own truck parts to buying them from suppliers -- many in the United States -- and becoming an assembler. Dina buys most major components for its trucks from United States companies like Cummins, Caterpillar and Detroit Diesel.
 
Prospects Are Strong
 On paper, Dina's long-term market prospects are strong. During the economic crisis of the 1980's, many Mexican companies could not afford to replace aging trucks in their fleets.
Roberto Swaine Bell, president of the association representing Dina's 65 dealers, said that if the Government allowed interest rates to come down, Dina's sales could surge in spite of Mexico's weak economy.

HEADLINE: Fewer Electronics Products Are Being Produced in Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 26

 BODY:
Japan's production and exports of consumer electronics products are shrinking rapidly, a trade association reported Friday.
The new figures show that the nation is having difficulty retaining its manufacturing base for color televisions, compact disk players, videocassette recorders and other products for which Japan's industry is famous. Even if giants like Sony and Panasonic continue to lead the world in such products, the "made in Japan" label is becoming harder to find as manufacturing shifts to countries with lower wages. 
 Production in Japan of audio and video equipment fell an estimated 12.7 percent in 1993, the second consecutive year of a double-digit decline, the Electronics Industry Association of Japan said.
The 1993 output of 3.28 trillion yen, or about $30 billion, is the lowest since the early 1980's and only two-thirds the level of 1991. And consumer electronics exports, which fell 23.5 percent in the first nine months of the year, are now less than half of what they were at their peak in 1985.
In its annual report on the state of Japan's electronics industry, the trade association painted a dismal picture of companies battered by the economic slump at home, market saturation for leading products, the rise of the yen and competition from abroad.
While consumer electronics suffered the sharpest decline, production of computers, copiers, calculators and components also fell in 1993. Over all, it is estimated, Japanese output of electronics equipment and components dropped 5.9 percent in 1993, the second consecutive decline, to 20.94 trillion yen, or about $190 billion. The preliminary figures are often revised later.
About the only bright spots were increases in production of liquid-crystal display screens and computer chips to feed a boom in personal computer sales in the United States.
The industry association projected that total electronic output would inch up by seven-tenths of a percent in 1994. But even that estimate may be optimistic. The association had predicted gains in output in the last two years.
 
Sharply Lower Earnings
 The fall in electronics production has led to sharply lower earnings, or losses, at virtually all Japanese electronics companies. Most of those are cutting their payrolls by thousands of employees, though they are trying to avoid outright layoffs. Some factories have been closed.
Some of the problems plaguing industry, like the strong yen and a lack of standout products, will continue even after the economy recovers.
The rise of the yen this year against the dollar and other leading currencies accelerated the shift to offshore production. In 1993, for the first time, Japan imported more color television sets, mostly from Japanese-owned factories in Southeast Asia, than it exported.
In Japan itself, videocassette-recorder production fell 11.6 percent in 1993, to 20.6 million units, and television output fell 9.5 percent, to 12.9 million sets. Video camera output fell 7.1 percent, to 7.8 million units, and digital audio disk player production fell 8 percent, to 10.5 million units.
 
One Product Did Better
 The only audio-video product that showed any substantial growth was the video disk player, for which output rose 31.7 percent, to 2.3 million units. Newer products like wide-screen televisions, the mini disk and the digital compact cassette show promise, but sales are still too small to have much of an impact, the association said.
While the association said the worst of the declines might be over, consumer electronics production is expected to drop 3.3 percent in 1994.
Although consumer electronics is the part of the electronics industry for which Japan is most famous, it is becoming a smaller and smaller part of overall production as Japan shifts to industrial electronic products and components. Consumer products accounted for only 15.7 percent of Japan's electronic output in 1993, way down from 28.8 percent in 1983.
Production of industrial electronic equipment fell an estimated 6.9 percent in 1993, to 9.8 trillion yen, or $89 billion, and is expected to remain roughly the same in 1994.
Output of computers, the most important product in this category, fell 11.4 percent, to 4.8 trillion yen, or $44 billion, as Japanese companies sharply curtailed spending on automation or shifted from large, expensive computers to smaller, less expensive ones.
While sales of personal computers have grown sharply in the United States, Japan's personal computer market has remained stymied by a lack of standards, software and networks and by difficulties in typing Japanese characters. And Japanese personal computer makers for the most part have not been able to capitalize on the growth in the American market because they have been outpaced by American and Taiwanese manufacturers.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
With an internal truce in place, Carl's Jr. seeks a new strategy to thrive in a weak economy.

BYLINE: By Calvin Sims

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
NOW that Carl N. Karcher and the board of Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. have resolved their differences, at least temporarily, the fast-food chain Mr. Karcher founded 52 years ago must undergo radical changes if it is to thrive in a weak California economy.
The company, which is based in Anaheim, Calif., and operates the Carl's Jr. restaurants mainly in this state, has seen its fortunes decline lately as it has faced increased competition from leading fast-food chains like McDonald's and Burger King. 
 In the nine months up to Nov. 1, Karcher Enterprises reported revenues of $354.5 million, down from $396.9 million in the comparable period a year ago. Net income in the period was $4.55 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with $5.26 million, or 28 cents a share, in the first nine months of the previous fiscal year.
 Industry analysts said the chain must introduce new menu items, achieve consistency in food quality, establish a new image and, above all, offer customers "value" meals. Analysts estimated that a meal that included a hamburger, french fries and a soft drink cost about $4 to $5 at Carl's Jr., compared with $2.50 to $3.50 at some other fast-food chains.
First a little history: Enter Donald E. Doyle Jr., the former head of Kentucky Fried Chicken's domestic operations, who succeeded Mr. Karcher as chief executive in January. Mr. Doyle has taken several steps to cut costs and clean up Karcher Enterprises' balance sheet.
Exit Carl Karcher, who was ousted as chairman by the board in October after he threatened to depose directors when the board refused to approve his plan to test-market sales of Green Burrito Mexican foods at Carl's Jr. Mr. Karcher vowed to return, but first he had to pay off huge personal debt tied to his majority stake in the company.
Re-enter Carl Karcher, who was named chairman emeritus this month after restructuring his debt with the help of his investor friends, William P. Foley 2d and Ronald Lane, who became directors of Karcher Enterprises. Mr. Karcher's role in the company is now expected to be ceremonial. Mr. Foley and Mr. Lane have endorsed Mr. Doyle, who says the dual marketing with Green Burrito will not happen at Carl's Jr.
Loren C. Pannier, the chief financial officer, said Carl's Jr. would announce an "aggressive value campaign" in the spring to increase sales. "In the lean 90's, customers are saying you have great food but your prices are too high, so we plan to make selective reductions and begin an intensive ad campaign," he said.
Mr. Pannier said Carl's Jr. would finance the value campaign with savings from its cost-cutting programs, which have yielded $15 million so far.
Impressed with Karcher Enterprises' new management team and its "excellent" restaurant locations in California, Donald Dwyer, an analyst for Salomon Brothers, has issued a "buy" recommendation for the stock. "I expect they will have an earnings turnaround because of the dramatic drop in cost structure and the introduction of value-priced menu items," he said.
The consensus among analysts who follow Karcher Enterprises is that the company will earn 30 to 40 cents a share this fiscal year. "The fighting is over," Mr. Dwyer said. "Everybody is now working toward the same goal -- improving shareholder value."
Shares of Karcher Enterprises closed at $10.50 in Nasdaq trading on Thursday, near the 52-week high of $10.625.
Douglas Christopher, an analyst with Crowell & Weedon, said he was pleased with the direction that the current management had taken at Karcher. But he said the board disputes might not be over. "I don't think such a nasty board fight goes away so easily, especially when Karcher now has two friends who are directors," he said.

HEADLINE: November Tool Orders Slip

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Orders from manufacturers for machine tools slipped in November from the previous month due mostly to weak exports, but remained sharply higher for the year.
The Association for Manufacturing Technology reported yesterday that machine tool orders fell 3.96 percent in November to $241.2 million, from $251.15 million in October. 
 But November orders were 49.5 percent higher than in the month a year earlier. Also, year-to-date orders were up 30.6 percent over the first 11 months of 1992, at $2.97 billion.
Albert W. Moore, president of the McLean, Va.-based trade group, said 1993 would be the best year for machine tool orders since 1988, when orders reached $3.5 billion.
The monthly report covers metal-cutting and metal-forming machine tools. Machine tool orders are believed to provide insight into future industrial activity, since increasing orders can, over time, signal that manufacturers are confident that orders for their products are on the rise.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
As Junk Bonds Thrive, Municipal Issues Drag

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The junk bond and municipal bond markets have had a record year of new issues. But the similarities end there. While junk has thrived, municipals have not.
The flood of a record $290 billion in new municipal bonds has depressed municipal prices and made the market underperform the Treasury market through most of the year. Only a sudden year-end rally is raising the market's prospects, and only in maturities of about 10 years and less. 
 But the pressure of a record $68 billion of new junk bonds, or those below investment grade, has not held back the performance of the high-yield market. In most measures it has outperformed Treasuries.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the gauge for performance is the ratio of the yield on the bond to the comparable Treasury security yield. If municipal bonds are favored, buying picks up and that ratio should decline as the yield on municipal bonds falls faster than that on Treasuries.
But that has not happened, despite an increase in the top income-tax rates that makes tax-exempt municipal bonds more attractive. For example, the tax-equivalent yield on a 15-year New York City bond yielding 5.85 percent is 9.69 percent at a top tax rate of 39.6 percent, up from 8.48 percent when the top tax rate was 31 percent in 1992. At the new 36 percent rate, the yield is 9.14 percent.
 
Treasuries Outdone
 In the junk bond market, total return is the measure of performance preferred by Martin S. Fridson, managing director of high-yield research at Merrill Lynch. By this measure, junk bonds have outshown Treasuries this year, with the yield on Merrill Lynch's index of junk bonds up almost 17 percent while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a proxy for Treasury market performance, is up 11.65 percent. Only the 30-year Treasury bond has done better, with a total return of slightly above 18 percent.
It seems easy to explain the performance in the junk bond market: The scramble for yield in an environment of falling interest rates kept individual investors, money managers and mutual funds buying, and the demand was enough to offset a surge in supply.
One measure of this demand is the willingness of investors to take on greater credit risk by gobbling up the lesser-rated category of junk bonds that are dicier but offer higher interest rates.
John G. Lonski, the senior economist at Moody's Investors Service, said that through last week the total of junk bonds rated B-3, five notches lower in credit quality than the best junk bond and 15 levels below a triple A company, had grown to $9.2 billion, or 15 percent of the $60 billion of publicly issued high-yield bonds this year. (Privately placed junk bonds bring the projected total for the year to $68 billion.) The $9.2 billion is nearly double the total of B-3 issues through this time last year.
 
Willing to Take Risk
 "It is telling you that investors are showing a greater willingness to take on greater risk," Mr. Lonski said. He said there was comfort in that the overall junk bond default rate had declined significantly, to about 3 percent this year from 3.7 percent in 1992 and 9.5 percent in 1991. Still, the default rate on the clearly popular B-3 junk bonds in the first year after issue has averaged 18.6 percent since 1983.
The mystery is this: If investors are so willing to take on higher credit risk to buy junk bonds, why are they not lining up for municipal bonds? Municipal yields on an after-tax basis are close to, or even higher than, those of junk bonds. And the risk is less.
A New York tax-exempt issue sold recently by the New York State Dormitory Authority included 10-year notes priced to yield 5.20 percent. That is the taxable equivalent yield of 8.12 percent in the 36 percent tax bracket, and a yield of 8.61 percent in the top 39.6 percent bracket, which includes the so-called millionaire's surcharge. Moody's rating was Baa-1, an investment grade rating.
"Markets, from time to time, just don't reflect value," said Richard R. Godfrey, the executive vice president of the research division at the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, a big insurer of municipal bonds.
 
Tax Impact Hasn't Been Felt
 Margaret D. Patel, a senior vice president at Boston Security Counselors in Boston, manages money in both the municipal and junk bond markets. She agreed with the general notion that despite the publicity about the President's tax increase, the impact had not hit many investors because higher withholding was delayed until 1994.
But she said she thought that the makeup of the municipal market, dominated by retail investors and the mutual funds that buy for them, prevented demand from shifting quickly.
"It is true that as tax rates go up munis become more valuable," she said. "But the bulk of the muni buyers are already in the market. So only a small percentage of money will be moved."
But, she added, "in the junk, you still have a market that is underowned as a category because of the bad experiences in 1989 and 1990."

HEADLINE: A Needless Gift to the Pentagon

 BODY:
The numbers are obvious: If President Clinton hopes to fulfill his promise to reshape spending priorities, he will have to cut existing domestic and defense programs by at least $50 billion over the next five years. Otherwise, he will not be able to hit Congress's deficit-reduction targets and pay for his economic strategy of investing in education, training, research and infrastructure.
Yet last week he made the budget hole $10 billion deeper by giving the Pentagon money to pay Congressionally mandated salary increases over the next five years. And the Pentagon wants even more to cover inflation during a five-year period in which it already plans to spend a whopping $1.2 trillion. That averages $240 billion a year -- about five times what Russia spends on defense and nearly as much as the rest of the world combined. 
 The President is surrendering too quickly. The Pentagon can find $10 billion for salaries and $20 billion for inflation in its own budget. If Mr. Clinton doesn't take on the military, he will jeopardize the core of his domestic agenda.
Unfortunately, Mr. Clinton's decision to fork over the $10 billion is only the latest in a series of retreats in the battle to cut the Pentagon budget. Mr. Clinton promised to trim military spending by $88 billion over five years, which seemed a plausible target given the collapse of the Soviet Union. But after a "bottom-up" review, Defense Secretary Les Aspin backed off.
Mr. Aspin's original idea was to base the military budget on a strategy under which the U.S. would be prepared to fight one Iraq-sized enemy on the ground while holding off another foe from the air. Instead he decided the U.S. must base its force levels on the assumption that someday it could be confronted with two regional wars simultaneously.
But if he has the will, Mr. Clinton can still find his $88 billion without even addressing the strategic question. He could, for example, cancel an unneeded new aircraft carrier -- which alone would save $5 billion next year -- and cut excessive force levels. He could also buy fewer F-22 stealth fighters, originally designed to counter future Russian fighters that in fact won't be built.
Without such trims, Mr. Clinton's domestic agenda will pay the price for Pentagon excess. The President originally proposed spending about $30 billion next year on his investment program -- mass transit, highways, early education, school-to-work assistance, job training, energy and scientific research. The total was later cut in half, to about $16 billion. And $2.5 billion will now be siphoned off to cover Pentagon pay hikes.
This year, Mr. Clinton funded only one-third of his important initiatives like worker training and early childhood education. If he is to turn the Federal budget as well as the economy around, he needs to grab every dollar he can find. The Pentagon is a perfect place to look.

HEADLINE: Trouble in Foley Square

BYLINE: By Kenneth Conboy; Kenneth Conboy, a United States District Judge in the Southern District of New York since 1987, announced Dec. 6 that he is stepping down from the bench at the end of this year because of family considerations.

 BODY:
Many lament that litigation in America, particularly in the historic Federal court at Foley Square in Manhattan, is very different today from what it was in the 1950's.
What has brought about this change in the years since I was a boy, aspiring to practice here? 
 To begin with, the sheer numbers of lawyers now admitted to practice in the Manhattan Federal court have overwhelmed the powerful sense of collegiality and pride that obtained in the halcyon days of the 50's.
In 1958, there were about 600 new lawyers admitted to our rolls. Today, we admit 3,000 a year. At this annual rate, more than 50,000 lawyers will be authorized to practice before the court just after the turn of the century.
This crowding has caused a loss of focus and discipline among lawyers and has led to a regrettable reduction of quality in their legal papers, arguments and professional manners.
We have seen the creation of a vast and complex network of rules, regulations, statutes and entitlements that have provided a Dionysian feast of revenues for even the least gifted of our profession.
Litigants now routinely challenge the hiring, admission, suspension, firing, tenure, retirement, pension, discipline and promotion decisions -- or non-decisions -- of businesses, unions, corporations, universities, clubs, governmental agencies, cities, towns, the armed forces and myriad other organizations at every level of life in the nation, on the grounds of race, age, sex, gender preference, disability or national origin.
These cases, rarely settled, are characterized by high levels of acrimony and subjective claims of victimization; they are immensely time consuming and are controlled by legal standards that, lacking sufficient precision, are overgeneralized and of marginal use.
The crowds of lawyers and cases -- and the national obsession that any private disappointment is an affront of constitutional dimensions -- have altered the focus of trial work. Immense sums and years are spent in round after round of document production and counterproduction and endlessly multiplying depositions.
The economics of going to court chagrin and alarm the nation's business community, whose competitiveness in global markets is damaged by a degree of litigiousness in America that is simply unheard of in the rest of the world.
In recent years, the principal change in the institutional culture here at Foley Square has been our near-transformation into a national narcotics court -- a phrase used by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in describing the metamorphosis of a number of Federal courts.
In the last fiscal year, this preoccupation with drug cases has been accompanied by an overall increase in criminal filings of all kinds by an astonishing 19.7 percent at Foley Square.
Today, drug cases dominate the docket. The complex sentencing guidelines have extended fivefold the time needed for sentencing proceedings. One result is that the great civil cases that defined the role and stature of the court at Foley Square for 203 years have greater and greater difficulty in being heard.
In the past, these matters -- touching upon patent, antitrust, telecommunications, banking, finance, commerce, labor relations, copyright, trade, taxation and securities regulation concerns -- gave the court national and often global influence.
To compound the problem, the Senate has now passed a most astonishing crime bill.
It contains more than 100 provisions that create new Federal crimes. It federalizes nearly all street crimes in which a gun is used, crimes related to youth gang activities and certain domestic violence cases.
A particularly significant provision would authorize Federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in cases where a gun that crossed state lines under a broad new definition of interstate commerce was used in a homicide.
The response of the Congress and the Bar to these formidable alterations in the litigation culture of the Federal trial courts has been to call for the efficient management of the chambers of each Federal judge. But in deliberative matters it is misguided to think that faster is better.
Even more radical proposals are being heard. For example:
Double the number of Federal judges. Critics of this approach say that it would dilute the quality of the Federal bench.
Create more specialized courts -- for example, those that handle patent and tax matters. Constitutional scholars worry that highly technical benches focused exclusively on narrow legal areas will lose touch with broad legal values.
Abolish Federal jurisdiction in cases involving multistate litigants. A bad idea: reducing access to the United States courthouse is undesirable.
Eliminate jury trials in complex civil cases and substitute panels of experts. No, we should not tamper with the jury system.
Here are some changes I think should be made.
First, all lawyers who want to practice in Federal trial courts should be required to demonstrate a continuing special proficiency in litigation skills. Broad powers should be vested in district court judges to supervise, regulate and remove lawyers who do not or cannot meet requisite high standards of competence and civility. Vigilantly applied, such powers would be far more effective than the current practice of judges imposing "monetary sanctions" -- some call them fines -- on deficient lawyers.
Second, procedural constraints on the number of frivolous cases allowed to be filed by endlessly litigious plaintiffs must be devised. The United States Supreme Court has already said that such abusers can be denied indigent status. The Congress must take steps to bar such litigants entirely from the courthouse door or at least subject them to stiff and discouraging fees.
Finally, and most importantly, there must be a re-examination of Federal policy aimed at controlling violence and drug use that emphasizes exclusive enforcement in Federal trial courts.
Rather, state criminal courts should be given more money so that they can prosecute gun violence adequately. This would allow the Federal courts to pursue their central function of defining and defending constitutional values, interpreting and applying Federal statutes and conducting civil and criminal trials that fall under traditional Federal jurisdiction.
As for the immense problem of drug abuse, legalization of dangerous drugs is morally untenable.
Focusing Federal dollars on treating and re-educating drug addicts is the only long-term national approach that will rescue the nation from the misery inflicted on the addict, crime victim and society as a whole by the market economics of the heroin and cocaine industry. Such a policy would bring hope of more constructive results in the national effort to fight drugs.
These proposals, if enacted, would brighten the future of the great Federal trial court at Foley Square in a way that would be consistent with its illustrious history.

HEADLINE: Blacks Join to Halt Deep South Waste Site

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A Dec. 13 news article reports that plans for a toxic dump site in Noxubee County, Mississippi, are pitting blacks against blacks. The facts do not support the view that the struggle is one of poor blacks for hazardous waste against middle-class blacks opposed to hazardous waste. I am the lawyer for African-American Noxubee County residents before the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 While you state that poor black people supported one of the hazardous waste projects, the only person you quote in support is Ike Brown, a paid consultant to Hughes/F.T.I., one of the hazardous waste companies seeking to locate in Noxubee. You do not mention that a 1993 survey by the Mississippi State University sociology department shows that hazardous waste opponents outnumbered proponents by 3 to 1 among black respondents in Noxubee County. This is hardly possible if only "middle-class blacks" oppose a facility.
You further report that the administrative complaint with the E.P.A. by African-Americans for Environmental Justice alleges that the decision to place two hazardous waste facilities in Noxubee County was racially motivated. The complaint makes no such claim. The complaint and additional documentation filed with the agency's Office of Civil Rights state that the claim is one of disparate impact, and not intentional discrimination.
Disparate impact analysis in this context looks not at racial motivations, but at whether or not one group of citizens will bear more of a risk than everyone else, and whether or not there is good reason to dump all the risk on that group. If Mississippi's only hazardous waste dump is in Noxubee County, African-Americans will bear the environmental, social and economic risk for the entire state.
The administrative civil rights complaint filed by African-Americans for Environmental Justice simply makes the point that Mississippi's hazardous waste facility siting system, largely supported by Federal taxpayer dollars, could ameliorate disparate impacts by adequately assessing the environmental, social and economic risks of placing huge hazardous waste facilities in poor areas.
You incorrectly state that Mississippi law allows the siting of only one hazardous waste facility to a county. There is no such limitation.
Your implicit assumption seems to be that disparate impacts of environmental risk on African-Americans should not be considered if there is disagreement in the black community -- even when it comes from paid consultants to the hazardous waste industry. If that standard were applied, a lot of discrimination would go unchallenged.

The Arts

 BODY:
The number of people directly employed by the arts in New York City and its environs has increased 16.6 percent since 1982, according to a study of the region's $9.8 billion-a-year arts industry by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The study credits the diversity and resourcefulness of the area's cultural institutions for the growth of the arts in tough economic times. The overall number of jobs generated directly or indirectly by the arts nevertheless fell 8.2 percent in the same period. Even though the arts have prospered, with the decline in manufacturing, the arts community tends to rely more on suppliers outside the region and its spending has less impact locally.

HEADLINE: Security Is Main Theme Of a Spate of New Laws

BYLINE: The Associated Press

 BODY:
"Safety first!" is the nervous theme of many state laws that will take effect in January, doing things like requiring helmets for bike-riding children in California and Tennessee, checking potential teachers for criminal records in Oregon, New Hampshire and Tennessee and making barbers train longer in Hawaii.
Whether seeking to protect children from bad apples or consumers from bad haircuts, state legislators strove this year to bolster security in an insecure world. 
 Florida, stunned by a spate of killings of tourists, banned guns from the hands of anyone under 18, except for hunting, marksmanship practice or competition under adult supervision. The threat of violence inspired a California law to let schools ban gang attire in class.
New Hampshire doctors who test positive for the virus that causes AIDS or for hepatitis B will need special permission to perform invasive surgery.
There is no special reason to enact laws in January, only the symbolism of a fresh start at the top of the calendar. Many states set laws to take effect 60 or 90 days after signing, or after the legislative session ends.
In sifting the tea leaves of these latest January laws, trends appeared. Last year saw a lot of taxes and tax breaks intended to squeeze revenue from an anemic economy.
A year later, money-making measures were conspicuously absent, though a few came close.
Oregon raised its minimum wage to $4.90. Mississippi exempted pensions from the state income tax. Florida employers will see worker-compensation premiums shrink. Michigan relieved property-tax payers of the burden of supporting public schools.
And Colorado's Legislature protected owners of baseball teams and stadiums from litigious spectators as part of the deal to get Denver a National League franchise, the Colorado Rockies. The law will limit the liability of a team and stadium if a fan is hit by a stray ball or slips on a hot dog.
Political scientists were at a loss to explain what, if anything, the lineup of new laws meant.
"We've had a change in the Administration, and maybe the states are waiting for new policy direction," suggested David King, assistant professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
Some observers forecast a slew of crime bills next year, but for now, safety seems the watchword.
Starting on Jan. 1, riding in the open back of a pickup truck will be illegal in California, where children age 6 and younger will also need life jackets in motorboats and in sailboats less than 26 feet long.
 
Enforcing Sobriety
 New Oklahoma regulations will allow tinted car windows to be only so dark.
Seeking safety against drunken drivers and following the lead of many other states, Florida, New Hampshire and New Mexico lowered the permissible level of alcohol in the blood to 0.08 percent from 0.10 percent. In California, drivers under 21 caught with a blood-alcohol level of just 0.01 will lose their licenses for one year.
Under a yearlong experiment, Illinois joined about 30 states that require repeat drunken drivers to use a device that keeps a car from starting if the driver has alcohol on his breath.
Addressing dangers in the marketplace, Rhode Island required credit agencies to send consumers their credit reports within four days of a request and to inform consumers when credit is denied.
Video stores in New York will be barred from selling their customers' names and rental histories to anyone.
Illinois outlawed unwanted sales pitches by telephone and banned such calls from 9 P.M. to 8 A.M.
Connecticut repealed its two-decade-old no-fault auto insurance law. Motorists should see premiums drop, but they will have to go to court to make accident claims against other drivers.
Car insurance in Illinois and buckling up in Vermont will be mandatory, as they already are in most states.
Some new laws will guard against the inept and the incompetent. Texas acted to regulate the operators of machines that keep blood and oxygen flowing during open heart surgery.
Notably, many of these measures will cost the states nothing, except for enforcement.
Greater expenses may be in the offing, of course, with changes in the national health care and welfare systems. Some states ventured ahead, not waiting for word from Washington.
Universal health care will come to Tennessee with a system called TennCare. And unmarried women in Georgia who are under 18 and pregnant, or are already mothers, must live with a parent or guardian to get welfare. Further, able-bodied recipients must accept job offers to remain eligible for welfare, and benefits will be frozen for two years for mothers on welfare who have another child.

An article on Monday by The Associated Press about state laws that will take effect in January misidentified the state that has raised the minimum hourly wage to $4.90. It is Washington, not Oregon.

HEADLINE: 10-Degree Chill Brings Out Hardy, and Foolhardy

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE

 BODY:
Among the many acts of cold-induced dementia committed by frozen New Yorkers yesterday, Terry Mathurin's brief midtown escapade deserves a special place.
At 12:45 P.M., Mr. Mathurin, a limousine driver from Queens, grabbed a huge fistful of snow barehanded from the roof of an out-of-state car at the Plaza Hotel and handed it to his giddy passengers, children from a wealthy Houston family who had never seen it before. 
 "Thanks, Terry," said Seneer Paya, the 9-year-old sitting in the front seat, gazing at the pile dripping on the upholstery. "This is so cool."
The driver, though clearly bewildered by the unpredictable obligations of his trade, was hardly alone in reacting outlandishly to the cold spell, which seemed to startle New York after a lulling holiday weekend. Temperatures dropped to a low of 10 degrees in Central Park early yesterday and rose to only 20, immobilizing cars and penetrating both expensive parkas and makeshift cardboard shelters.
The sudden freeze was part of a cold wave that covered much of the Northeast and Middle West. [Page D19.]
But in New York, the streets of the city remained thick with activity and overt foolhardiness.
Scores of tourists and natives alike lined up outside mid-Manhattan attractions without hats or gloves, and were unable to provide satisfactory explanations for their bare skin.
"Well, it just didn't look that cold out," said Stephen Plaskow, a Greenwich Village man whose hands and head were brazenly exposed as he waited for 20 minutes to enter F.A.O. Schwarz. "I should have turned on the radio, right?"
Bob Lavner, a spokesman for the Automobile Club of New York, struggled to explain why the club received 5,000 dead-battery calls yesterday, about three times the number the club expects for a day of similar temperatures with no snow.
"It's the heaviest volume of calls for service that we've had in recent memory," said Mr. Lavner. "All I can figure is, it's the first cold work day of the season, on a Monday, after a holiday, and people were just caught short. Maybe in the last few years we've all grown a little soft."
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, was seen standing hatless and bemused in the middle of a Fifth Avenue sidewalk, next to Andrea Mitchell, the NBC News correspondent. If he were trying to gauge the state of the economy, he would have had to conclude that it was booming, with barely enough room to maneuver on the sidewalk. All of the Fifth Avenue theme parks -- F.A.O. Schwarz, the Coca-Cola Store, the Warner Brothers store, Rockefeller Center -- were surrounded by long lines or heavy crowds, their visitors undeterred by the cold.
 
Pockets of Good Sense
 There were scattered pockets of rationality, though. Peter Nichols, a magazine art director, boarded his Manhattan-bound bus in Hackensack, N.J., and barely recognized his fellow commuters for all the wool and Thinsulate.
"I looked around me and all I saw were bundles of clothes with hot breath steaming out and more than one passenger with a full-face ski mask on," said Mr. Nichols. "If you didn't know any better, you would have thought that it was the Terrorist Express."
The benches of Broadway along the Upper West Side of Manhattan were generally empty yesterday, after many homeless people decided the city's shelters were less unpleasant than the chill.
A bench in the Bronx, however, was the scene of an ordeal on Sunday night for Ivellise Otero and her four children, who suddenly found themselves homeless after an aunt with whom they had been living threw them out. A friend with whom Ms. Otero was hoping to stay had moved, the police said, and she had nowhere else to take her family but the park bench at Metropolitan Oval and Unionport Road in the Parkchester section.
Police found her and the children, ranging in age from 3 months to 7 years, at about 12:45 a.m. yesterday. The family had been in the cold for about two hours. All five were taken to Jacobi Hospital, where they were treated for exposure, and then were taken to emergency shelter.
 
Warmed by Con Ed
 Most homeless people who remained outside had more experience in survival, relying on the kindness of passersby and the warmth of Con Ed's steam pipes.
At 41st Street and First Avenue, across the street from the utility's steam-generating plant, about 15 men were laid out in sleeping bags and cardboard boxes along a sidewalk that the underground pipes had transformed into a blocklong radiator. Eduardo Gonzalez, the resident of Box 3, said the heat made his spot more comfortable than the shelter. He said neighborhood organizations dropped by every day to bring food.
Sure enough, a few minutes later James Lewis, an outreach worker with the Grand Central Partnership, walked by offering free hot meals nearby at St. Agnes Church.
"Maybe we'll get four or five guys who'll come in, and maybe two of them will stay inside for the night," said Mr. Lewis. "But maybe not. These guys are tough."
The police said an unidentified man in his 40's died of unknown causes in his home, an abandoned Cadillac, outside 159 East 126th Street at 3:50 p.m. yesterday. A fire was burning in the car, and Officer Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman, said the man may have started the fire to keep warm. The Medical Examiner's office plans to investigate to determine the cause of death, he said.
In Red Hook, Brooklyn, three men with canes and sticks stood at the center of a small, complicated shantytown along Columbia Street. A makeshift pot boiled on the top of an even more makeshift fireplace, cooking a curious collection of meats amid the acrid flames. With a good deal of defiance and irrationality, the men shrugged off the hardship.
 
'We Have Heaters'
 "Don't worry about us," one said. "We have heaters in our homes."
The city's shelters reported a below-capacity crowd of 6,233 homeless people, but many suburban shelters were full. In New Britain, Conn., the 36 beds of the Friendship Service Center had been taken when three more people came in at the last minute, said Ellen P. Simpson, the shelter's director. They stayed on couches in the shelter's lounges.
"Our policy in the cold weather is that nobody is to be denied entrance," Ms. Simpson said.
Roz Post, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said the city received 1,656 complaints of no heat on Sunday and 1,850 through 4 P.M. yesterday, a long way from the record 6,107 calls received on Dec. 12, 1988, after several days of below-zero temperatures. She warned, however, that the number of calls was likely to increase as people returned home from work and found no heat.
At the new Riverbank State Park in Harlem, which had not yet experienced a truly cold day since its opening on May 27, officials were delighted to discover that the popular park had lost little of its allure in the chill. The indoor pool, at 86 degrees, was a natural attraction, and skaters at the outdoor ice rink found that skates glided more smoothly through the ice than they did on warmer days.
The weather even cooperated in disguising the most notorious trait of the park, built atop a sewage treatment plant.
"When I came in this morning there was no odor, and there's still no odor," said Mike Nixon, the park's deputy director, as a nose-numbing wind from the Hudson River swept over the hardy Astroturf of the park's track. "So maybe there's a silver lining in this weather, after all."

HEADLINE: BUDGET GAP GROWS BEYOND $2 BILLION FOR NEW YORK CITY

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
The chief fiscal adviser to Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that New York City was facing a budget gap for next year even larger than the $2 billion projected a month ago by a special committee formed by Mayor David N. Dinkins.
The adviser, Abraham M. Lackman, said the gap in the budget for the fiscal year that begins in July -- the first Mr. Giuliani will have to prepare -- had grown by at least $250 million because of a significant decline in the assessed value of the city's real estate. 
 With Mr. Giuliani preparing to take office at the end of the week, the new projection underscored the difficulties he will face as he tries to balance the city's budget without the increases in taxes or painful cuts in services that he promised to avoid.
 
A First Step
 The new figures also marked the first step in the highly political budget process, in which City Hall typically seeks more money from Albany and Washington, tries to extract concessions from unions and prepares the public for the worst, just in case.
"Not to beat a dead horse, but this is the most severe budget gap any new administration has had to face in two decades," said Mr. Lackman, Mr. Giuliani's selection for budget director.
Officials in the Dinkins administration agreed that the assessments showed a decline, but said that other factors might work to mitigate the damage. Jon Lukomnik, the special assistant commissioner in Mr. Dinkins's Office of Management and Budget, said that while there might be a shortfall in the property tax revenues, there might also be an increase from other taxes, like the sales tax, as the economy shows signs of improving.
"It's very easy to pull out all the negative risks and come up with a big number," he said.
 
Special Advisory Role
 Mr. Lackman disclosed the new estimate as Mr. Giuliani announced that Marc V. Shaw, the finance director for the City Council, would serve as his Commissioner of Finance. The Finance Commissioner is responsible for collecting the city's taxes and other revenues and administering the city payroll, while the budget director drafts the administration's overall fiscal plan.
In making the appointment, Mr. Giuliani said he would expand Mr. Shaw's duties to include a special advisory role on fiscal policy, working with Mr. Lackman "to help us develop a broad strategy for economic development in dealing with the budget and for handling what are clearly very difficult problems."
Mr. Giuliani also made two appointments yesterday in the area of health care. Facing criticism about the relative inexperience of his appointees, Mr. Giuliani announced that he would keep on Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, the current Commissioner of Health.
And he named Maria Mitchell, a health-policy adviser in the Koch administration, to serve as the director of the Office of Health Services. Hers is one of three newly created positions under Deputy Mayor Ninfa Segarra that will coordinate the administration's health, social service and education policies.
Mr. Lackman declined to specify how Mr. Giuliani would close the widening gap between revenues and spending in the city's nearly $32 billion budget. "I have a whole list of things that I plan to present to the Mayor," he said, "but I think it would be more appropriate to discuss those in January."
Last week, Mr. Lackman asked most of the city's agencies to prepare a scenario for cutting their budgets by 5 percent this year and another for cutting 10 percent. The request did not call for cuts in Medicaid, welfare or city debt service and exempted the Board of Education and City University of New York.
 
'Major Transformation'
 At the news conference announcing the appointments yesterday afternoon, Mr. Giuliani also avoided specific proposals on closing the budget gap, though he reiterated his campaign pledge to cut the city's portion of the hotel tax as soon as possible, which would increase the gap at least at first.
"New York City is going through a major transformation," Mr. Giuliani said, "in order to be more effective in the delivery of services and at the same time operate within a budget."
Mr. Lackman based his new budget projection on the annual assessment of property tax values, which is due next month, as the Mayor's office begins to put together its preliminary budget proposal. Those figures were unavailable to the mayoral commission that provided its estimate to Mr. Dinkins on Dec. 2.
Mr. Lackman said the reassessment showed a decline of $1.7 billion in the assessed value of property from the total of $78 billion this year -- a decline, he calculated, that would reflect a decline in tax revenues of $250 million to $300 million from the projections already written in the budget.
Joseph Dunn, a spokesman for the Department of Finance, confirmed Mr. Lackman's general estimate of a drop in revenue, but he declined to comment specifically, saying the final assessment would be released on Jan. 13.
Mr. Lackman and John S. Dyson, who will serve as Mr. Giuliani's Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, laid the blame for the gap on the economy as well as on the Dinkins administration, saying the city lost more than 300,000 jobs under Mr. Dinkins's stewardship.
"It's a legacy of an incredibly weak economy," Mr. Lackman said. "And it's a legacy of inaction."
In November, the Dinkins administration forecast a budget gap of $1.7 billion for the fiscal year that begins in July. That was an increase of $450 million from its projection in August.
Earlier this month, however, a special committee formed by Mr. Dinkins to study the city's perennial budget deficits estimated that the gap was actually nearly $2 billion.
The committee, whose report became known by the name of one of its members, Donald D. Kummerfeld, then outlined a series of harsh recommendations for closing the gap, including layoffs, fees for residential garbage collection and increases in the sales tax and property taxes for single-family homeowners.
Mr. Giuliani dismissed the committee's recommendations as examples of "the old thinking."
 
The Experience Factor
 Leland T. Jones, a spokesman for Mr. Dinkins, criticized the nascent administration for politicizing the budget projections while ignoring the well-intentioned proposals for solving the city's fiscal problems.
"They're just doing the old math," Mr. Jones said. "They're making the mountain as high as they can so they can blame somebody else when they back off their promises and take credit when they don't have to."
Mr. Giuliani's latest appointees -- who brought to 25 the total number of appointments -- have considerable experience in government.
Mr. Shaw, who is 39, joined the City Council as its chief budget analyst in 1989 after serving for eight years as an analyst for the Finance Committee in the State Senate, which is controlled by the Republicans. Mr. Shaw's experience in Albany and his familiarity with the City Council could prove helpful to Mr. Giuliani as he tries to push his proposals through the Democratic majority.
 
Health Over Politics
 "I think it will provide some level of institutional knowledge that will be good for the Council and good for the Mayor," Mr. Shaw said.
Dr. Hamburg, who is 38, is the second commissioner under Mr. Dinkins that the Mayor-elect has decided to keep on. Last week, he reappointed Dr. Luis R. Marcos as the Commissioner of Mental Health.
Dr. Hamburg, a graduate of Harvard Medical School, joined the Department of Health as a deputy commissioner in 1990, taking over as commissioner in May 1991. She was President Clinton's first choice to be the nation's coordinator of AIDS policy until she removed herself from consideration.
Dr. Hamburg has been a strong supporter of policies -- including exchanging needles to slow the spread of AIDS -- that Mr. Giuliani or his aides have criticized in the past. Yesterday, she praised the Mayor-elect for recognizing that the city's health issues require expertise. "Our mission really is one that rises above issues of political parties," she said.
As director of the Office of Health Services, Ms. Mitchell, who is 38, will oversee the city's health policies, particularly in the wake of the national health care reform now being worked out in Washington.
Mr. Giuliani said that Ms. Mitchell would be expected to consolidate a number of smaller offices under her new office. Those include the Office of Children's Health, the Office of AIDS Policy, the Office of Drug Abuse Policy and the Office of People with Disabilities and H.I.V. and Human Services Planning.

HEADLINE: Congressman Touted as a Candidate for Governor

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 27

 BODY:
In the latest attempt to unite New York State's Conservative and Republican parties, several prominent Republicans have begun a campaign to draft United States Representative Gerald B.H. Solomon, a Republican-Conservative from Glens Falls, as a candidate for governor.
Mr. Solomon, 63, had not figured prominently in the gubernatorial calculus before today, and his emergence as the latest compromise candidate underscores fault lines within the two parties that have stalled formation of a united front against the Democrats. 
 Significantly, United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a powerful leader of both parties, said today that he believed that Mr. Solomon, an eight-term Congressman, would be "the leading person, a very formidable opponent," if he runs.
Mr. D'Amato has been the leading supporter of State Senator George E. Pataki, a Republican from Peekskill, whose candidacy Mr. D'Amato encouraged. But Mr. Pataki has failed to win support from other key Republicans, and Mr. D'Amato indicated today that he might be willing to shift his support to Mr. Solomon.
 
Meeting on Draft
 The effort to draft Mr. Solomon, who said today that he had not decided whether to run, resulted from a meeting on Sunday between him and several Republican and Conservative leaders, including the State Senate Majority Leader, Ralph J. Marino of Oyster Bay, L.I.; Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island, and Michael Long, state chairman of the Conservative Party.
At that meeting, both Mr. Marino and Mr. Molinari expressed strong support for Mr. Solomon, spokesmen for both men said. Mr. Long said he liked the conservative stands Mr. Solomon has generally taken on social and economic issues, but wanted to see if he could win the support of members of the local Conservative Party state committee.
"It's early enough," Mr. Long said in an interview. "The best way to find the best candidate is to see who captures the imagination of the people and can develop support, not just among Conservatives but across party lines."
Mr. Molinari, who said today that he would not be a candidate for governor, said he helped arrange the meeting because he thought Mr. Solomon was one of only a handful of people who could win the support of both parties.
"For those of us that don't want to go through a repeat of what happened four years ago, we have to reach a consensus on the best candidate," Mr. Molinari said. "For a variety of reasons, Solomon is the alternative."
In 1990, the Republicans and Conservatives could not agree on a challenger to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the Democrat, who won in a landslide as the two parties split votes.
Mr. Cuomo has said he will say on or about the first of the year whether he will seek a fourth term.
Several weeks ago, Mr. Pataki was considered a strong contender for the backing of both parties, appearing to have the support of Mr. D'Amato and the Republican State Chairman, William D. Powers.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Bentsen, Beltway Insider, Now Fights The Notion That He's Out of the Loop

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
The last thing people would expect Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to be is insecure, but nowadays the silver-haired Texan often comes across that way as he pursues a surprising mission: convincing the world that he is in the loop.
That was not a mission Mr. Bentsen expected last year when Bill Clinton, as President-elect, offered him the Treasury post to cap a distinguished 22-year Senate career, which included leadership of its Finance Committee and a much-praised stint as the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate in 1988. 
 But after a year that has proved far bumpier than he bargained for, Mr. Bentsen has felt compelled to begin a new campaign, one aimed at combating the rumors and murmurs about him: hints that he was cut out of the action on health care, that he was thinking of quitting, that he did not fit in with Mr. Clinton's 40-something crowd, that he could have done more to ease passage of the President's budget package last summer.
 
Listing His Credits
 Seated for an interview in a plush, off-white armchair facing an elegant portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary, Mr. Bentsen is intent on explaining that he is no mere bit player.
It was Lloyd Bentsen from whom Mr. Clinton sought advice on Boris N. Yeltsin's showdown in Russia, the Secretary tells a visitor; it was Lloyd Bentsen who won Presidential applause when the budget was approved by Congress, and it was Lloyd Bentsen who persuaded Mexican leaders to make citrus and sugar concessions to win passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"I'm enjoying this job more and more," Mr. Bentsen said. His voice is soft and low-pitched, and his message is unspoken: people who say the 72-year-old Treasury Secretary is out of the loop don't know what they're talking about.
In the view of Mr. Bentsen's aides, it is a sad commentary on Washington's backbiting political culture when a man with his credentials has to devote so much of his energy to debunking the rumor machine.
 
Questions on Health Care
 Although Mr. Bentsen irritated some of the Administration's more liberal members with his lack of enthusiasm for the President's $16 billion economic stimulus package, which the Republicans defeated last spring, many of the rumors about the Secretary's diminished role grew out of his role -- or lack of it -- in the Administration's effort to overhaul the nation's health care system.
And some of the rumors might have been fueled by Mr. Bentsen and his aides as they groused that Ira C. Magaziner, the President's senior adviser on policy development, who worked closely with Hillary Rodham Clinton on the health care plan, had largely left the Treasury out of the early preparations for the plan.
Mr. Bentsen put that problem behind him by going over Mr. Magaziner's head and telephoning Mrs. Clinton to say he would not testify before Congress on the plan until Treasury received enough information to assess its financing.
The day after he called, Mr. Bentsen said, the Treasury received the information he requested.
 
Skepticism About Costs
 The Secretary admits he was skeptical at first about cost estimates in the plan, but he now insists he is satisfied with it -- partly because of a change that bears his imprint.
"I pushed in a meeting with the President for caps on the entitlements and subsidies" in the health plan, Mr. Bentsen said. "And he very readily said: 'I'll agree to that. We don't want runaway entitlements.' "
Mr. Bentsen said he feared that plans to subsidize health insurance for small businesses and low-income households might someday spiral out of control. "In case we made some mistakes in our calculations, we put in a circuit breaker," he said. "That added to my confidence."
But other Administration officials say Leon E. Panetta, the White House budget director, and Robert E. Rubin, the chairman of the National Economic Council, share the credit for creating the caps.
 
Meeting With Moynihan
 The White House turned to Mr. Bentsen to help sell the health plan to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who succeeded him as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Several days before, Mr. Moynihan had described the plan's financing as "fantasy."
After the Secretary explained the plan's financing in detail, Mr. Moynihan was reassured. As one participant recounted, Mr. Bentsen, using his powers of persuasion, told the Senator: "You have done more than anybody else to save Social Security. We know you care greatly about welfare reform and plan to do a lot about it. Here, with this health care plan, we are giving you the opportunity to deal with another of the biggest social problems facing the nation."
If there is one piece of evidence that convincingly demonstrates Mr. Bentsen's influence, it is the North American trade agreement, Administration officials say. At an Oval Office meeting in August, some aides proposed that the President allow the agreement to die a quiet death, but the Secretary, a longtime friend of Mexico, helped persuade Mr. Clinton to make an all-out effort to win approval of the agreement.
"He really persuaded the President that it was a fight to go to the mat for, regardless of the politics and chances of winning," said Gene Sperling, deputy director of the National Economic Council.
As evidence of Mr. Bentsen's role in the agreement, Treasury aides have prepared a fact sheet showing that he telephoned 64 members of Congress, met with 85 others, gave 45 speeches, took 9 trips and talked to 233 reporters.
 
Summer of Discontent
 The Lloyd Bentsen basking in the glow of the trade pact's passage appears to be a far cry from the Lloyd Bentsen of last summer.
"For a while it almost seemed that the Administration tried to keep him hidden," said Representative Dick Armey, a Texan who heads the House Republican Conference. In August it became known that three of Mr. Bentsen's longtime aides were leaving the Treasury, and rumors flew that he would not be far behind.
At the time, Mr. Bentsen did little to quell the rumors, something he could have easily done by acknowledging that two of the aides were being eased out in a management shake-up. The third took early retirement and moved back to Texas. Instead, Mr. Bentsen kept quiet, knowing that his silence would only fuel the speculation about his departure.
 
Questionable Criticism
 The insecurity that he occasionally projects stems less from any question about his abilities or performance than from a sense that he has been criticized unfairly as Treasury Secretary and that his place in history might be jeopardized.
There was, for example, an article in The National Journal, a Washington-based weekly magazine on politics and government, that gave him a "C" for teamwork in pushing the President's agenda. That irked him, and soon his aides were asking reporters: What senior official did as much in pushing for Nafta or the budget? Which department lined up international aid packages for Russia and the Palestinians?
Then there was the piece in The New Republic saying he was being outshone by Roger C. Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, who ran the "war room" that helped push through the budget package, and by Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.
 
Looking Ahead to 19861996
 "That's hogwash," Mr. Altman said. The reason Mr. Bentsen's top aides shine so bright, Treasury officials say with a bit of self-congratulation, is that he chose one of Washington's strongest staffs and, as he did when he was in the Senate, has given his staff a long leash.
Nowadays, his aides make sure he appears on the Sunday morning television circuit. And Mr. Bentsen sends out strong hints that he plans to stay as Secretary through 1996 -- although some officials would not be shocked if he stepped down in early 1995, shortly before his 74th birthday, saying he has achieved what he set out to do.
Although Mr. Bentsen frequently plays tennis and has breakfast with Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the Secretary gives Mr. Clinton and his deficit-reduction plan, rather than the Fed chairman, most of the credit for the economy's recent upturn.
"Europe is flat, Japan is flat, and here we are the world's engine of growth, nothing spectacular but what we think is solid, sustainable growth, with low inflation," Mr. Bentsen said. "That is an achievement. Plus the lowest interest rates in 25 years. The financial markets have taken our deficit reduction seriously, and that's why we see interest rates so low. That's why the economy is doing so much better."
The unspoken submessage: if the President gets high marks for turning the economy around, so should his Treasury Secretary.

Host Marriott Adds to Marquis Hotel Stake

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
The Host Marriott Corporation, which was spun off from the Marriott Corporation in October, has seized a 28.6 percent interest in the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square in New York after an Atlanta real estate developer and former partner in the hotel defaulted on a loan.
The Washington-based company, which took on $2.2 billion in debt in the spinoff, disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week that the foreclosure of the loan to the developer, John Portman, would have the effect of adding another $445 million in debt to its balance sheet. 
 By foreclosing on Mr. Portman's loan, Marriott, which had a 50 percent stake in the holding company that owns the hotel, gains a majority stake. As a result, current accounting rules require Host Marriott to consolidate the hotel's assets and $445 million in liabilities, the largest of which is a $375 million mortgage loan, on its own financial statements.
 
Hotel Worth About $400 Million
 Tom McConnell, a senior manager at Kenneth Leventhal & Co. in New York, said that based on recent hotel sales in Manhattan, he estimated the Marriott Marquis was worth about $400 million.
The increased balance sheet debt is important because skittish investors have already seen the value of their Marriott-related bond holdings go through one wild swing because of concerns about excessive debt. That was tied to the controversial restructuring that broke Marriott into two pieces: Host Marriott, an asset-rich company with a heavy debt load, and Marriott International Inc., a hotel management company.
But Host Marriott officials played down the effect of the New York hotel debt restructuring.
"Picking up a larger piece of equity doesn't increase our expenses," said Host Marriott's chief executive, Stephen Bollenbach. The company "just accounts for it differently."
A company spokesman pointed out that the holding company for the Marriott Marquis, rather than Host Marriott, would ultimately be responsible for repayment of the $375 million debt.
"The cash generated from the hotel will cover its carrying costs," said Robert Souers, the Host Marriott spokesman. "In the astronomically unlikely event that the hotel is unable to meet its debt service, the recourse would be to the hotel itself, not to the company."
He added: "We are comfortable having that debt on our books. This is a very strong piece of real estate."
The 48-story 1,874-room hotel, which opened in 1985, is one of New York City's largest.
Neal Kamin, general counsel for the privately held Portman Companies of Atlanta, declined to provide details of the transaction.
"There was a note with a high interest rate and the net result is that the property is going back" to Host Marriott, he said. "Basically, Marriott and Portman went through a technical glitch to transfer the asset as part of a restructuring of other assets."
In 1985, Marriott sold a 28.68 percent interest in the hotel to Mr. Portman for about $26.3 million. It loaned him the money at a 12 percent interest rate and took the stake as collateral, according to the S.E.C. filing.
 
Promissory Note Restructuring
 In 1992, it allowed Mr. Portman to restructure the promissory notes. But during the 1992 fourth quarter Mr. Portman "informed the company that he would not be making further payments on the promissory note," according to the registration statement. That led to the foreclosure, which Host Marriott said it hoped to conclude early in 1994.
For now, neither Standard & Poor's nor Moody's Investors Service plan to change their ratings on Host Marriott's debt, even though its balance-sheet debt is rising. "At this point, we don't have any plans for doing anything with the Marriott rating," said John Maxwell, an S.& P. analyst.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, Host Marriott's stock ended up 12.5 cents, at $8.75, and Marriott International ended up 25 cents, at $28.375.

HEADLINE: New York's Puerto Ricans Split in Economic Success

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Financial differences among Puerto Ricans in New York City are growing, as some join the economic mainstream and others remain mired in poverty, an analysis by the City Planning Department has concluded. Over all, more Puerto Ricans left the city during the late 1980's than arrived, with many of the poorest returning to Puerto Rico and the middle class moving to the suburbs.
"The polarization is evident," said Angelo Falcon, president of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy. 
 "The second generation is beginning to do better and once Puerto Ricans get up there they seem to do fairly well relative to other groups," Mr. Falcon said. "But that's the trick -- getting there."
Puerto Ricans have been disproportionately hurt by the dramatic decline in factory jobs and by the preponderance of female-headed households with a larger than average number of children, the analysis showed.
 
Highly Segregated Group
 "Although the overall picture of Puerto Ricans reveals economic progress in the 1980's, there are disturbing signs of deepening poverty in several Puerto Rican-dominated districts," the analysis said. Puerto Ricans are highly segregated, the planners found, supporting "the thesis that their poverty is sustained and in fact exacerbated by their geographic as well as economic isolation."
The analysis was supervised by Dr. Joseph Salvo of the Department of City Planning's Population Division, who said: "There are two Puerto Rican communities in New York and that rift is growing wider. There are those -- heavily born in the 50 states -- who are achieving growth in labor force participation, education and English proficiency. And there are those in bad straits and worse over time.
"The total city population doesn't have this serious bifurcation," Mr. Salvo said.
New York City's Puerto Rican population grew more slowly in the 1980's than during any other decade since the migration during World War II, the analysis said. For the first time, most of the city's Puerto Ricans were born on the United States mainland, not in Puerto Rico. Also, Puerto Rican New Yorkers no longer make up a majority of Puerto Ricans living on the mainland.
 
Difference Among Migrants
 Puerto Ricans migrating to the city from elsewhere in the United States were younger, better educated and had higher incomes than those who stayed put in New York. Those who came from Puerto Rico were similar to Puerto Rican New Yorkers, except that fewer women worked and household income was lower.
Drawn from census figures, the analysis presents a decidedly mixed picture of the city's dominant Hispanic group -- one that constituted 50.3 percent of the 1.8 million Hispanic New Yorkers counted in 1990, but which, presumably, no longer represents a majority because of a surge in immigration from the Dominican Republic, Colombia and other countries in Central and South America.
Puerto Ricans registered sharp gains in education, English proficiency and family income. Still, Puerto Ricans were among the poorest New Yorkers.
Nearly half the Puerto Rican children under age 18 are growing up in families headed by a woman and fully half the children live below the poverty level. One in three Puerto Rican households relied primarily on public assistance in 1989, reporting no earnings. All three of the city's 59 community districts in which real income declined during the 1980's, all of them in the South Bronx, have large Puerto Rican populations.
The analysis found that many children are growing up in what are termed subfamilies, in which neither parent heads the household. While that situation is not a Puerto Rican phenomenon, the report said, "its impact is felt more on the Puerto Rican population" because of the large number of children, the high proportion (though declining number) of female-headed families and the "poorer socioeconomic status of the population."
While twice as many Puerto Ricans reported income below the poverty level than New Yorkers over all, the analysis found a substantial rise in real income during the 1980's. Nonetheless, the Puerto Rican families still made only 56 cents for every dollar earned by all families in the city.
Predictably, married couples fared best. Their income increased by 41 percent during the last decade, raising it to about 75 percent of the average income for all New York families. Puerto Rican women who are college graduates earned 83 cents for every dollar earned by all women in professional specialty jobs.
But real income for all Puerto Rican families headed by a woman was outpaced by income gains for all female-headed families. Real income, adjusted for inflation, declined for Puerto Rican female-headed families with their own children.
 
Some Other Findings
 The Planning Department's analysis was presented at Manhattan Community College to representatives of civic groups and social service organizations by the department's director, Richard L. Schaffer. These are among the other findings:
*Puerto Ricans accounted for about 51,000 of the more than 800,000 people who moved into the city since 1985 and 138,000 of the more than one million New Yorkers who left town. Among the Puerto Ricans who moved from New York City, 4 in 10 went to Puerto Rico.
*The Puerto Rican population is maturing, but is still younger than the city's general population. A growing segment is made up of the 25-to-44-year-old sons and daughters of migrants from Puerto Rico.
*The proportion of Puerto Ricans age 25 and over who are high school graduates lagged behind the total population, but rose from 35 percent in 1980 to 46 percent in 1990.

HEADLINE: Thriving on Difference;
International High Students Speak Language of Learning

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
Abdul Samad, a 20-year-old from Afghanistan, went to school for the first time three years ago. He said he did not know a word of English when he was admitted into the International High School in Queens. He felt blind and deaf and panicky.
"I was very crazy," said the high school student, dressed in a black leather jacket and jeans. "I wondered, 'How am I going to learn this language or study this? I've never been to school.' I didn't know how to write the alphabet." 
 Abdul is now a model student at International High, an alternative public school that is nationally recognized for the way immigrant students are taught and valued. He will graduate this spring as a senior, but came to school already a man.
Since age 10, Abdul had fought as a guerrilla rebel against the occupying Soviet forces in his homeland. He saw 10 friends die in combat and was hospitalized himself at age 14 with a bullet in his leg. He recalls precisely how he killed two Russian soldiers at point-blank range. He said they had fatally wounded his mother and seriously injured his father and three brothers in a bombing of his house.
He found his way to America through a network of Afghan contacts, and like thousands of other young immigrants each year, filtered into the New York City school system, where the foreign-born population has more than tripled in the last four years.
As issues such as violence, apathy and disenfranchisement dominate public discussion of the New York City school system, the International High School offers a glimmer of hope to immigrant youths on a first-come, first-served basis.
The school, on the sprawling campus of La Guardia Community College, admits only students who have been in the United States for less than four years and score low in English proficiency on a standardized language assessment test.
Enrollment reflects geopolitics. The 460 students, who are from 60 countries and speak 42 languages, come from places often in turmoil. When the school opened eight years ago as a joint effort of the Board of Education and the City University of New York, there were only a handful of students from Eastern Europe. Now Eastern Europeans are the third largest group, with 128 students. The biggest representation is from Spanish-speaking countries, followed by the Asian bloc, including China, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan.
When Abdul arrived, he was met with a swell of support from teachers and other students. He was thrown into classes -- the school does not separate students according to their varying abilities in English -- and his Afghan-speaking classmates helped him learn English, even as he went to classes in science, math, history and art. The teachers would speak slowly, write names and draw pictures to guide him along, and they started him off with easier assignments.
 
Impressive Academic Record
 At International High, teachers and staff break the mold in the way English is traditionally taught to students with limited English proficiency. Every teacher doubles as an English instructor to some extent, reinforcing language development as they teach instruction in the core subject areas.
The school has an impressive record of academic success. Ninety-three percent of the students go on to college and more than 90 percent graduate having taken at least one regular college-level course at LaGuardia Community College.
"It's an extraordinary place," said Jacqueline Ancess, a senior research associate at the National Center for Restructuring Education, Schools and Teaching at Teachers' College, Columbia University. "This school makes sure these students have a future and gives them the skills for the future. It lets them know that they are valued."
There is a calm, mature air about the business of education at International High. There are no school bells. Classrooms are dispersed throughout the campus, and students carry college IDs, enroll in college courses, eat in the college cafeteria and work out in the college gym. They participate in a career-oriented internship program outside the school for one third of each school year.
The population of the school, which was intended to accommodate between 400 and 500 students, is also small enough so that the staff gets to know students.
 
Learning to Get Along
 It was not long after Abdul arrived at the high school before teachers and counselors noticed his tenseness around Russian students. "He used to jump on anything a Russian said and make fun of it," said Ruthellyn Weiner, an assistant principal. "He would not get into physical stuff, but there would be verbal sparring."
But Abdul found that his enmity toward Russians had no place in the school. Every day, students have to work together in small groups to complete assignments. Some of his classmates were Russian.
"Just because of the constant working in groups, conflicts couldn't exist in that fashion," said the assistant principal. "He dealt with it. It was not even acceptable to him."
Abdul has now set his sights on life after high school. He aspires to be a pilot.
"I'm here to get an education and to get something for the future," he said during a class break. "In America, anything you want to do is possible."
 
Optimism Encouraged
 Abdul's optimism is echoed by many students in the school, as they stride the hallways and listen intently in class. The feeling does not come by accident, teachers and administrators say.
"The optimism is infectious," said the principal, Eric Nadelstern, whose own parents were Holocaust refugees from Poland and Romania. "To the extent that we are successful, students leave us as competent learners and competent individuals. The spirit that is shared by the entire faculty is that our students represent the future."
In a classroom humming with Polish, Spanish and Chinese accents on a recent morning, students expressed a litany of hopes and dreams in response to a math teacher's question about what kind of student they wanted to be.
"I want to be the best I can and I want to be an A-student and always improve," 15-year-old Maria Christian of Ecuador said in one happy breath.
"The more you want, the more we have," assured the teacher, Simon Cohen.
International High is constantly evolving to meet the needs of students. Over the years, the class periods have gone from 35 minutes to 70. This year, for the first time, the curriculum has gone entirely interdisciplinary, with instruction in core subjects linked by themes.
The school is now broken into six thematic clusters in what amounts to six mini-schools. Each trimester, a small team of teachers from each cluster is responsible for whta happens to about 70 students in the core subject areas during the day.
During their four years, the students cycle through 12 clusters to accumulate the credits needed to graduate. In one cluster called "Beginnings," incoming students like Rafael Dobrowolski explore their immigrant experience through lessons in English, math, science and art.
 
Remembering Homelands
 Rafael is a 15-year-old Polish boy. As far as he is concerned, the future shines bright. A year and a half ago, Rafael left Poland where there were soldiers on the street and the outlook was bleak. His father has found a job cutting grass in a Queens cemetery and his mother works as a secretary. Rafael, who was once ashamed to speak because of his hobbled English, is learning big new words like "sophisticated" this year.
"I say it quite a bit," Rafael boasted the other day.
Even as students labor over their English-speaking skills, International High makes a point of fostering the memories of homelands around the world. Teachers don't get upset if students speak in their first language in class. At a native language celebration at the school earlier this month, Martin Vu rose to read an essay he had written about his native country, Vietnam:
". . .Only deep, deep inside my heart actually knows how I miss those coconut trees running along the river side, those tenderly sweet taste of the mango, those intensely warm flavor of the durian. I don't want to recall any further because this makes me sad."
The voice rising with emotion came from a quiet 18-year-old who left Vietnam because he said he was not allowed to attend college. His father had served as a surgeon in the South Vietnamese Army and is still regarded as the enemy, he said. At age 13, Martin was imprisoned for 2 1/2 months as he tried to flee the country. When he finally did leave Vietnam in 1988, he spent two years in refugee camps in Malaysia and the Philippines.
Martin now lives in Queens with his mother and three sisters but his heart remains in Vietnam. His father, who is unemployed, and brother subsist there on financial support from relatives in America.
". . .I just want to say to all immigrants that America may be your home for the rest of your life, but don't forget where you came from," Martin told the assembly. "It's like you're in the present and heading to the future, but don't forget your past no matter how good or bad it was. You can't go forward unless you know what steps you have passed. Everyone has a country!"

A Korean Voice: Forceful, but Almost Inaudible

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Not long ago a military officer here, a hard-liner when it comes to North Korea's nuclear bomb project, expressed some grudging admiration for how the negotiations with the North had been handled by South Korea's very unmilitary Foreign Minister, Han Sung Joo.
Mr. Han, he said, is a brilliant man, the country's premier political scientist, probably a pretty crafty negotiator. But he suffers a character flaw, the officer said: he is so soft-spoken, so calm, that "he makes me wonder if he is really Korean." 
 In his Foreign Ministry office the other day, the man who has emerged as the precise, English-speaking voice of a new South Korea, one whose Government is no longer dominated by former military officials, conceded that he had often asked himself the same question.
"I'm more like a Thai than a Korean," the 53-year-old former professor said with a wan smile, in a voice so quiet that visitors sometimes have to lean over to hear him. "I think I'd like to do things in a more rational way, in a country that you could call, well, emotion-prone."
 
Chief Architect of Strategy
 Amid considerable struggles within South Korea's year-old Government, the first headed by a civilian in three decades, Mr. Han has emerged as the chief architect of Seoul's and sometimes Washington's strategy for dealing with the Communist Government of Kim Il Sung.
Along the way, he has brought a new tone to his country's diplomatic efforts, a self-assurance that has permitted the South to treat its traditional enemy less like a mortal threat, and more like a cranky, sometimes unpredictably violent old relative who must be humored and negotiated with in his last days.
In a diplomatic role reversal, it has often been Mr. Han, sitting within firing range of North Korea's forces along the demilitarized zone, who has urged the Clinton Administration, in distant Washington, to calm down, to keep cajoling and tempting North Korea's leaders rather than threatening them.
He is acknowledged as the architect of what has come to be known as the "package deal," the current offer to trade full inspection of the North's declared nuclear sites in return for an end to the annual Team Spirit military exercises and talks about trade, aid and diplomatic recognition.
But in Seoul, Mr. Han, who had never before served in a senior Government post, makes many uncomfortable -- especially in the military and the intelligence agencies. "The truth is that I have had an easier time dealing with the barbarians than my own domestic audience," he acknowledged, smiling at his use of a label once reserved for all foreigners.
 
The Center of Gravity
 "An overwhelming thought here is that we cannot trust the North Koreans, and therefore there is no use in talking to them. There is much truth in that. But they don't understand that on the basis of this possible deceit it is still useful to go on talking."
To Washington's frustration, South Korea's language has often seemed to veer from hawkish to accommodating in recent months, as different factions in Seoul captured the ear of President Kim Young Sam. But the center of gravity returns regularly to Mr. Han's let's-keep-negotiating view, one that a former official here says won the day because Mr. Han "nudged, pushed, cajoled, waited and let others take credit."
Mr. Han understands the price of failure: he still carries a small piece of shrapnel in his lower back, a stray bit of allied fire left over from September 1950, when Gen. Douglas MacArthur's troops retook Seoul. He may have been saved, he said, by a North Korean soldier who "took out a long cloth and tied up my wound," as he escaped to the mountain house of a family friend.
A few days later, caught again in the crossfire, he and his parents narrowly escaped execution by a less friendly band of North Koreans, who let them go after his father deceived them about the family's true loyalties.
Unlike those of many in his generation, though, Mr. Han's views seem shaped less by the trauma of the war than by the two decades he spent out of Korea starting in the early 1960's -- a sojourn of study and teaching that wound through the campuses of Berkeley, the City University of New York and Columbia University.
 
'Quietness Is Deceiving'
 He quickly became the best known Korean in the American foreign policy circuit, and grew close to many of the people who have since become the core of the Clinton Administration's foreign policy team. But by the time he returned to South Korea in the early 1980's as a professor, critic and columnist -- he often wrote for Newsweek's international editions -- his views were frequently unwelcome here.
"His quietness is deceiving, because he is quite firm," said Lee Hong Ku, the former Minister of Unification and a longtime friend of Mr. Han. "Clearly past Governments were not happy with his calls for democracy. But the way he presented his case, and his international status, seemed to protect him."
His selection as Foreign Minister this year was a surprise: as an academic, he had often taken the minority view here that relations with North Korea were not zero-sum, that the North could get some of the economic development it desperately seeks without harming the South's interests. It is a view he still holds.
But in his move from "a practical scholar to a scholarly practitioner," he said, he has decided that most of the international relations works he keeps on his shelves "are not really relevant" in dealing with a nuclear renegade.
 
An Evolving Viewpoint
 The exception, he said, is "The Strategy of Conflict," a classic written by Thomas C. Schelling, the Harvard professor. "Not a day passes without my thinking of some of Schelling's examples," he said, declining to tip his hand by citing a few. (Curiously, Mr. Han's critics cite the book as well, noting its warning that in a crisis the side that is too controlled, too disciplined and too sensitive to counterarguments can lose the respect of its opponents.)
Now, Mr. Han says, his own view of North Korea is evolving considerably. Though North Korea is autocratic, he said, "it may not have a very monolithic decision-making structure." And that opens it up to divisions, giving the South a chance to dangle incentives.
"It's worth a try," he said. "Nothing will persuade the hard-liners like success."

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief Urges Patience on North Korean Crisis

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 27

 BODY:
The Secretary General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, called today for patience in resolving the crisis over North Korea's nuclear weapons program and reported that he was convinced after meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Il Sung, that the "political will" for a negotiated settlement still exists.
Speaking at a news conference here after arriving from North Korea on Sunday, Mr. Boutros-Ghali reported no progress toward winning North Korea's agreement to allow the resumption of international monitoring of its nuclear installations. His talks in North Korea coincided with a report that the United States Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that North Korea probably has built one or two nuclear weapons. 
 The North Koreans "are willing to continue negotiations and they believe they will be able to find a solution through more negotiations," he said. "There is a political will to solve peacefully this problem, the political will to avoid an escalation."
Mr. Boutros-Ghali would not say whether there was any deadline to the negotiations over North Korea's return to compliance with the monitoring provisions of the 1968 treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons.
Negotiations between American and North Korean officials have been under way at the United Nations in New York and are said to be making some progress toward a resumption of nuclear inspections linked to specific security guarantees from Washington, cancellation of joint military exercises by the American and South Korean armed forces and possible economic aid incentives.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali said he had not asked China to use its influence to persuade North Korea to reopen its nuclear sites to inspection and monitoring. On Sunday, Prime Minister Li Peng told Mr. Boutros-Ghali that China still believes that putting pressure on North Korea through the imposition of sanctions will not produce results.

Seoul Sees Progress
 SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 27 (AP) -- Significant progress has been made in talks between the United States and North Korea, South Korea's Foreign Minister said today. But the official, Han Sung Joo, said it was unclear whether enough progress had been made to resolve the dispute.
"I would say the chances of resolving the nuclear problem are 51 to 49," Mr. Han told reporters.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Japan Chip Fight Worsens

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Trade relations between the United States and Japan took a turn for the worse today as the two countries announced another drop in the foreign share of Japan's computer chip market, the leading barometer of trans-Pacific trade.
In response, the United States ordered emergency talks with Japan, a step that could eventually lead to trade sanctions. 
 The Clinton Administration faces a diplomatic problem in the emergency talks, which will begin in mid-January. President Clinton is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Feb. 11, and while the United States and Japan agreed last summer in Tokyo to reach several new trade pacts by then, little progress has been made.
 
Frustration Replacing Optimism
 The Administration does not want trade frictions to topple Mr. Hosokawa's fragile coalition Government. But while Administration officials were optimistic last summer that the coalition Government might be more receptive to American trade concerns than previous Liberal Democratic Party Governments, optimism is now giving way to frustration at the lack of Japanese concessions.
"The politics are obviously delicate, but there is less patience on our side than there was three months ago," said an Administration official who demanded anonymity. "Our business is with Japan, and their political problems are their problem."
The 1991 United States-Japan Semiconductor Arrangement called for imports to account for 20 percent of the Japanese chip market by the end of 1992 and for steady increases through 1995 in overall market access, measured in terms of market share, joint ventures and other indicators.
 
Market Share Falling
 The market share reached 20.2 percent in the fourth quarter last year but has been falling ever since.
Imported computer chips, mostly from the United States, accounted for only 18.1 percent of the Japanese market in the third quarter, Washington and Tokyo announced today, down from 19.2 percent in the second quarter.
This development has put pressure on the Clinton Administration, whose trade strategy with Japan is based on concluding further pacts modeled on the chip arrangement. But that arrangement must look like a success if the Administration is to follow its pattern in using numerical benchmarks in future deals.
The Administration is also eager to keep California's politically powerful computer-chip industry happy. President Clinton sees California as critical to a re-election campaign, and computer chip executives were among the first to support his campaign last year, breaking ranks with the many industrialists who backed President George Bush.
Stan Anderson, a lawyer who represents Japanese computer chip makers, said the Administration was wrong to emphasize market share. Total sales of imported chips have been rising in dollar terms in Japan, and the market share has been dropping only because sales of Japanese chips have been rising even faster.
Seiichiro Noboru, the top economics official at the Japanese Embassy here, also pointed to the rising sales but added that Japan would participate in the emergency talks.
American trade officials and industry executives rejected the argument about increasing sales totals, saying that the 1991 arrangement covered market shares.
 
Sharing the Pain
 "Their economy continues to be sour and they'd like to share the pain with us first," said Michael C. Maibach, director of government affairs at the Intel Corporation, the nation's leading semiconductor maker.
In ordering special talks today, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, invoked a previously unused emergency consultations provision in the 1991 agreement. The Reagan Administration requested similar talks in 1987 under the 1986 United States-Japanese Semiconductor Arrangement, which was replaced by the 1991 agreement.
The 1987 talks did not satisfy Mr. Reagan and his aides, who imposed 100 percent tariffs on Japanese power tools and color television sets worth $300 million a year, the harshest trade sanctions the United States has imposed on Japan since the end of World War II. They were gradually lifted and disappeared with the 1991 pact.

HEADLINE: Archdiocese Rejects Hartford Soup Kitchen

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 27

 BODY:
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford has refused to allow a church in downtown Hartford to house a soup kitchen, saying it could hurt the church's image and downtown development.
The Franciscan friars who run St. Patrick-St. Anthony Church and the governing council of the parish, the state's oldest, both agreed to accept the House of Bread soup kitchen. 
 But the archdiocese, which supports and sponsors other soup kitchens, rejected the plan.
"We have to be concerned about its function and the image that it projects to people who come there," said Msgr. Charles W. Daly, fiscal officer for the archdiocese. "If they don't like the image they won't come."
He said the archdiocese was also worried about development in this city, whose last department store closed in 1992.
The Franciscan friars who took over the parish in the fall of 1990 have given it new life. About 800 people now attend weekend Masses.
Monsignor Daly said that because the income of the parish was "very shaky," a soup kitchen was "not a prudent thing to do."
He added, "I think we have to be concerned with everybody. One of the reasons Hartford is poor is downtown is falling apart . . . downtown Hartford depends on development. You say 'take care of the poor,' but you have to take care of business and the solution to poverty is to put everybody to work."

HEADLINE: Dow Jumps 35.21 to Another Record

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks surged ahead yesterday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average to another new high.
The Dow jumped 35.21 points to close at 3,792.93, topping the previous record of 3,764.43 set on Dec. 13. 
 Trading was extremely light, however, with only 171.2 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 227.2 million shares on Thursday, the last session before Christmas.
"It was a featherweight move into new ground, as the year-end rally got into gear," said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president of Reich & Company. "Buyers were selective and sellers were out of town."
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks also hit a high, rising 3.16 points, to 470.54. The previous high of 469.50 was set on Oct. 15.
Other market indicators also rose, with the Nasdaq composite index gaining 2.36 points, to 761.06. Advancing issues outnumbered those that declined, 1,305 to 787.
Stocks drew some support yesterday from continuing signs of strong consumer spending. Retailers were generally upbeat over the weekend about the final days of their Christmas selling period.
The American stock market, moreover, was not the only one reaching peaks, as the German and French markets surged to highs as well. The DAX index in Germany rose 1.4 percent to 2,253.98, and the CAC-40 index in France rose 1.11 percent to 2,276.55.
Oil stocks were the standout on the Big Board, even though crude oil prices fell. Oppenheimer & Company raised its ratings on several industry giants, based on projections of lower production by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Exxon was up 1 1/4, to 64 1/4, ARCO was up 1 1/2, to 105 1/4, and Mobil gained 1 1/8, to 78 3/8.
 
 
Gains for Cyclical Companies
 Household names among cyclical issues, those closely tied to the ups and downs of the economy, benefited from continued optimism about economic expansion. They included General Motors, up 1, to 56 1/4; International Paper, which advanced 1 1/2, to 68 1/4; Deere & Company, which rose 2, to 73 5/8, and Caterpillar, up 2 1/8, to 90.
Also showing strength were many closed-end country funds, a result of the better-than-average performance of companies in emerging markets. Among the standouts were the Chile Fund, up 2 3/8, to 44 3/4; the Mexico Fund, up 1, to 39, and the Taiwan Fund, up 1 7/8, to 37.
Drug shares inched up on bargain hunting for stocks that were sold off during the year. Merck, the most-active stock on the Big Board, rose 1, to 35 1/4; Johnson & Johnson advanced 7/8, to 44 3/8, and Bristol-Myers Squibb moved up 7/8, to 59 3/8.
 
 
Turmoil for H.M.O.'s
 Stocks of health maintenance organizations declined after an article in The New York Times stated that the Clinton Administration would not encourage Medicare patients to join H.M.O.'s. Foundation Health fell 1, to 30 3/8; U.S. Healthcare dropped 1 1/2, to 56 3/4, and Pacificare was off 2 1/2, to 37 3/4.
Shares of Medical Care America gained 2, to 23, in reaction to a report in The Wall Street Journal that at least seven companies may be considering a purchase offer.
And the American depository receipts of the Vodafone Group, a British cellular telephone company considered a likely takeover candidate, rose 2 3/8, to 89 7/8.

Bethlehem Is Selling Some Mills

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Veritas Capital Inc., a start-up New York merchant banking firm, said yesterday that it had signed agreements with the Bethlehem Steel Corporation and the United Steelworkers of America to buy and reopen several closed Bethlehem mills in Johnstown, Pa., and a plant at its sprawling Lackawanna, N.Y., complex near Buffalo.
The privately held Veritas, which was started last year by Robert B. McKeon, a former merchant banker at Wasserstein Perella, is paying about $25 million for the mills, people close to the deal said. They said Veritas expected to arrange more than $70 million in public and private financing for new steelmaking equipment. The purchase is to close late next month. 
 Reviving the plants, which were closed in January 1992, is expected to create jobs for 1,200 steelworkers in Johnstown and 250 in Lackawanna, after completion of a three-year modernization program, Veritas said. The main product will be automobile steering columns.
 
Creating a New Company
 "We are re-entering the market at a very favorable time for the North American auto customers," Thomas J. Campbell, a Veritas partner, said.
Veritas will create a new company, BRW Steel Corporation, named for Bethlehem's former bar, rod and wire division. Veritas will own 80 percent of BRW Steel, and local steelworkers union members will own 20 percent through an employee stock ownership plan.
The union has agreed to a five-year contract that includes limits on future pension and health benefit costs and flexible job classifications to help make the operation competitive with nonunion minimills.
Bethlehem is to retain its obligations for the pension and retiree health costs of its former employees at the plants and the possibility of environmental cleanup liability.
To breathe new life into Johnstown, where thousands of Bethlehem jobs have disappeared since the early 1980's, Pennsylvania is arranging $35 million in 2 percent bond financing for the project, Andrew T. Greenberg, the state's Secretary of Commerce said.
"The only way to effectively help Bethlehem market the B.R.& W. divison was to take our money and nail it to the mast," he said in a telephone interview.
New York State is still negotiating terms of a package of loans, guaranteed financing and hydroelectric power from nearby Niagara Falls, said Susan Glass, a spokeswoman for Vincent Tese, the state's Director of Economic Development. Continental Bank of Chicago and the CIT Corporation are the lead banks arranging senior debt, Mr. Campbell said.
He said BRW Steel planned to restart operations in the first half of 1994 and begin the three-year modernization. It will buy a continuous bloom casting system for Johnstown from the Mannesmann Demag Corporation, a unit of Mannesmann Demag A.G., of Dusseldorf, Germany. United Engineers and Constructors, a unit of the Raytheon Corporation, of Lenox, Mass., will install the equipment.
Henry Von Spreckelsen, a Bethlehem spokesman, said the company had continuously modernized the century-old Johnstown mills, installing an electric furnace in 1981. But facing competition from low-cost minimills, the company closed the bar, rod and wire units last year "because even with modernization we could not become profitable in that division," he said.

Prices Mixed for Treasury Issues

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, as the Government held its weekly sale of three- and six-month bills. Trading was extremely slow, and market participants were reluctant to draw conclusions from the price movements.
The average rate at auction for the three-month issue was 3.06 percent, unchanged for a third consecutive week, while the average rate for the six-month maturity was 3.21 percent, down from 3.25 percent last week. 
 Analysts said the auction was not greeted with as much enthusiasm as they expected, indicating that fund managers' portfolios were already sufficiently loaded with bills. And if anything, the analysts said, portfolio managers may be looking to move toward longer maturities at the start of the new year, expecting that interest rates will decline.
 
 
Selling Is Possible
 The subdued holiday trading volume is expected to continue through the remainder of 1993, traders said. But some warned that last week's successful auctions of two-year and five-year Treasury notes, and the gains in price these issues have had on the secondary market, may bring some selling in these maturities before the year ends.
"Most people have moved to the sidelines awaiting the start of the new year," said Larry Daly, senior vice president and portfolio manager for Putnam's Global Government Income Trust. "In fact, some closed down their desks early."
As for longer-term issues, the price of the 6 1/4 percent 30-year Treasury bond due in August 2023 was down 1/4 point late yesterday, to 10010/32 , with its yield rising to 6.23 percent from 6.21 Friday.
One feature of trading was a round of seven-day system-repurchase agreements added by the Federal Reserve at its customary intervention time of 11:30 A.M.
 
 
Little Economic Data
 Analysts said the addition of funds to the banking system should ease pressures on the Federal funds rate, the rate charged for loans between banks, which was at 33/16 percent, well above the Fed's presumed target of 3 percent.
No significant economic data were released yesterday, and the calendar for the rest of the week is thin, limited to December consumer confidence and housing reports.
Market analysts expect trading to pick up steam ahead of the December nonfarm payroll data that will be released on Jan. 7. They said there were signs in the latest Federal Open Market Committee minutes released on Thursday that the Fed was watching inflation carefully and may be poised to tighten and raise short-term rates if the jobs data indicate that the economy is picking up too much speed, raising the threat of higher inflation.
 
Corporate Trading Fades
 With that in mind, they said, the market may find a reason for increased activity ahead of the payrolls report. Dealers are also watching oil prices closely. With much of the nation feeling a cold snap, possible increases in oil prices could provide a glimpse of building inflationary pressures.
Some dealers are playing down the potential impact of the employment report, however, saying the market will remain quiet until deep into February, when a rash of reports on first-quarter growth begin to appear.
In the corporate bond market, where activity began to slow last week, trading came to a virtual halt yesterday, with no offerings planned this week and only skeletal crews at the corporate desks.
Both the primary and secondary corporate markets were quiet, with prices unchanged to a little higher, trailing the Treasury market. And with no market-moving economic data due out, traders expect the market to drift for a while.
Following are results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Bills	Average Price	99.227	98.377	Discounted Rate	3.06%	3.21%	Coupon Yield	3.12%	3.31%	High Price	99.234	98.382	Discounted Rate	3.03%	3.20%	Coupon Yield	3.10%	3.30%	Low Price	99.227	98.372	Discounted Rate	3.06%	3.22%	Coupon Yield	3.12%	3.32%	Accepted at low price	52%	30%	Total applied for	$44,304,073	$41,288,340	Accepted	$13,069,073	$13,083,140	Noncompetitive	$1,157,315	$808,868	
 
Both issues are dated Dec. 30, 1993. The three-month bills mature on March 31, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on June 30, 1994.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against Yen On Weak Data From Japan

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and other leading currencies yesterday after new reports showed continuing weakness in Japan's economy and the Tokyo stock market fell sharply.
"The Japanese economy is going to be weak through most of 1994 and that economic weakness is being translated into weakness on the currency," said Bruce English, vice president and head of institutional sales for ABN/AMRO. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 111.45 yen, from 110.68 yen on Thursday. The currency market was closed in the United States on Friday because of Christmas Eve. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 111.25 yen from 110.80 yen on Friday.
The yen fell overnight as the Nikkei stock index tumbled to a close below 17,000. Japanese stocks fell after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed to offer concrete steps to bolster the economy on Friday.
"We're all waiting for the stimulus package," said one foreign exchange dealer.
Furthermore, the Japanese Government reported that Japan's retail sales fell a steep 6.9 percent in November from a year earlier, after dropping 5.5 percent in October. Construction orders were down 16.1 percent year-on-year.
Industrial output rose a preliminary 1.8 percent on a monthly basis in November, after slumping 5.5 percent in October. Housing data were better, with starts up 8.7 percent from 1992 in November.
 
Dollar Drifts Narrowly
Gold prices rose in New York after being mixed overseas. On the Commodity Exchange, gold for February delivery, the most active futures contract, gained $2.10, to $389.10 an ounce.
The dollar drifted in narrow ranges against most currencies in quiet trade as many participants were away because of the Christmas and New Year's holidays.
The dollar rose to 1.7015 German marks in New York from 1.6940 marks late Thursday.
The dollar closed in New York at $1.3275 Canadian, up from $1.3268 Canadian on Thursday.
The British pound closed in New York at $1.5045, barely up from $1.5043 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates compared with Thursday's quotes included: 1.4430 Swiss francs, up from 1.4335; 5.7945 French francs, up from 5.7700; and 1,676 Italian lire, up from 1,656.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Journal Plans A Weekly Edition for Poles

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, Dec. 27

 BODY:
In a telling sign of how far Poland's economy has come, The Wall Street Journal's European edition is planning a Polish version of the paper as a weekly supplement to Poland's biggest-circulation daily.
The supplement, if given final approval by The Journal, will appear every Monday inside issues of Gazeta Wyborcza, and will be aimed at Poland's growing number of business people who want to learn about European and global financial trends. It would be the first version of The Wall Street Journal in a foreign language. 
 "One of the reasons we're interested is that the private sector in Poland has grown so quickly," Frederick Kempe, the managing editor of The Wall Street Journal/Europe, said. Because relatively few Polish business people speak English, The Journal sees the venture as a way to reach new readers, who may eventually learn enough English to read the daily Journal, Mr. Kempe said. The Wall Street Journal/Europe had a circulation of 57,505 in the first half of 1993.
A final decision on the venture will be made early next year, Mr. Kempe said. So far, the response from potential advertisers, ranging from banks to makers of expensive cars, looks "very positive," he said.
 
Mutual Benefits
 Wanda Rapaczynski, the executive director of Gazeta Wyborcza, said the project would add to the already considerable prestige of Gazeta. "Fred came to us with the seed idea and we thought there was a need and it would be good for us," she said.
As a partner in the venture, Gazeta Wyborcza would have full access to The Wall Street Journal/Europe articles and would choose which to run in the supplement, Mr. Kempe said.
A prototype of the 12-page supplement shows The Journal's nameplate in black and Gazeta's nameplate in red. Ms. Rapaczynski, who previously worked in New York as the vice president of new-product development at Citibank, said first-quarter advertising contracts had already been signed with a number of companies.
The supplement's front page, which relies on long columns of type and is devoid of photographs, has some resemblance to that of The Journal. A regular Journal feature, the Business and Finance column, is copied with short takes about international companies.
Poland already has a lively financial press, with two weeklies and one daily specializing in business. But these papers dwell almost exclusively on Polish issues. With the expansion of the Warsaw Stock Exchange -- the value of its index has increased sevenfold this year -- and the entry of more outside investors, the Polish business community is becoming increasingly hungry for global financial news. The Wall Street Journal/Europe, The International Herald Tribune and The Financial Times are sold on some newsstands in Warsaw and other large Polish cities, but Ms. Rapaczynski described the language barrier as "very severe."
 
A Respected Daily
 In Gazeta Wyborcza, The Journal has found a partner that is one of the most respected newspapers in Eastern Europe.
Edited by Adam Michnik and Helena Luczywo, who were leading figures in the Solidarity underground movement of the 1980's, Gazeta started in 1989 as the campaign newspaper of Solidarity and quickly grew into Poland's most respected newspaper. It is the only serious newspaper in Eastern Europe that holds the largest circulation in a country, with reliable domestic and foreign coverage and more than a dozen regional editions.
Gazeta has a daily circulation of 550,000, almost three times that of its closest Polish rival. Cox Newspapers of Atlanta, which publishes The Atlanta Journal and Constitution and other newspapers, acquired a 12 percent stake in Gazeta this year.
One concern of The Wall Street Journal/Europe was insuring that the original articles kept their journalistic integrity after being translated into Polish, Mr. Kempe said. But in the trials, the translations by the supplement's editor in Warsaw, Katrzyna Kubala, have passed the test, he said.
Neither Mr. Kempe nor Ms. Rapaczynski would discuss financial details of the project.
"The Wall Street Journal doesn't go into ventures to lose money," Mr. Kempe said. "Obviously we think there is some profit for us."

HEADLINE: Dave Beck, 99, Teamsters Chief, Convicted of Corruption, Is Dead

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Dave Beck, one of the most powerful and outspoken labor leaders spanning the middle of this century and the first of a series of teamster presidents to go to prison in the 1960's, died on Sunday in Northwest Hospital in Seattle. He was 99 and lived in Seattle.
Mr. Beck was the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters from 1952 to 1957, when he defied a United States Senate hearing on union corruption by invoking the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination 117 times. 
 Built almost of the same tough mettle as James R. Hoffa, who succeeded him as the unchallenged head of the teamsters, Mr. Beck was convicted in 1959 of Federal income-tax evasion and state embezzlement charges for stealing $1,900 from the sale of a union-owned Cadillac. He served 30 months in prison before being paroled in 1964.
"A certain number of people will say labor leaders are crooks," he said in 1986, when he was 92. "They'll say it more about the teamsters because we are the largest union in the world."
 
Pardoned by Ford
 After his release, Mr. Beck won a full pardon in 1975 from President Gerald R. Ford and was warmly received every time he appeared at teamster conventions and union halls. Mr. Beck, a millionaire, lived comfortably on a $50,000-a-year teamster pension and on income from real estate investments. Despite his wealth, he lived quietly in the basement of a house he built for his mother and sister 20 years ago.
It was before the Senate committee hearing conducted in 1957 by Senator John L. McClellan of Arkansas and masterminded, in part, by Robert F. Kennedy, the committee's chief counsel, that Mr. Beck thundered into public notice.
During two days of testimony, Mr. Beck was asked whether he took $322,000 from the union treasury. He refused to answer, invoking the Fifth Amendment time and time again. Fixing his questioners with an icy glare, Mr. Beck repeated in his raspy voice, "I refuse to give testimony against myself." He castigated Mr. Kennedy later as a "lot of bluff."
But the hearings nevertheless cost Mr. Beck his teamster leadership and his entree to Presidents and prime ministers. He was succeeded by Mr. Hoffa, who would be imprisoned himself for 13 years and who disappeared mysteriously in 1975.
Under Mr. Beck's leadership in the 1950's, the 1.6 million-member teamsters became what was generally regarded as the most powerful labor union in the country, but one that was continually plagued by accusations of mob-connected corruption and racketeering. But Mr. Beck succeeded in welding scores of autonomous and often feuding teamster locals into a union conglomerate that he said he patterned after big business.
"Labor is business pure and simply, just like Boeing or Safeway," he said. "Running labor is strictly business."
At the height of its power, the teamsters held what Mr. Beck would describe as a stranglehold on the American economy, controlling the distribution of virtually everything used by industry, business and consumers.
Mr. Beck and other teamster leaders also made their members the best paid unionized workers in the country, something he never let them forget when he returned to speak to them in small union halls and vacation-spot conventions.
"Some times it was rough and tough and bare knuckles and I'm proud of it," he told a room of retired teamsters when he was 89 years old.
He also denied ever stealing from the union, asserting that his embezzlement conviction was the result of "bookkeeping errors."
In fact he credits his imprisonment with saving his life, saying, "I figure I've got an extra 5 to 10 years to live because I went to prison," which he said dropped his weight from 211 pounds on a 5-foot-9-inch frame to a relatively slim 170 pounds. In recent years, he weighed only 144, still spry from daily workouts on a stationary bicycle.
 
Joined Union in 1914
 Mr. Beck, who joined the union in 1914 when he was the driver of a laundry truck, was the penniless son of a carpet cleaner and a laundress. He would end up a rich man with a strong conservative bent.
Mr. Beck worked his way up in the union by combining a shrewd sense of the American economy, a strong belief in the capitalist system and a conviction that a labor contract was as sacred as the Bible.
Starting in the Northwest, Mr. Beck said later, his mission was to convince companies that it was better business for them to recognize him and his drivers than to fight them. He was no orator or fiery visionary, he admitted, just a plain man who could talk nonstop.
While he was widely viewed as a tough talking union leader, he also was a great believer in polishing labor's image. Toward that end, he once asked the Ford Foundation to sponsor a program under which union agents would receive a college degree, with an emphasis on the humanities.
 
Gunner in World War I
 Mr. Beck was born in Stockton, Calif., in 1894, and taken to Seattle when he was 4. He dropped out of school when he was 16 to help support his family. A Presbyterian, he never drank, smoked or gambled.
In World War I, he served as a gunner on aviation patrols over the North Sea. He then returned to his laundry delivery job and was picked by the teamsters to help organize drivers. Part of his success was convincing employers and hotel owners to deal only with organized laundries, forcing other laundries to sign up with the union.
Mr. Beck became the union's executive vice president in 1947. By the end of 1948, he was consolidating teamster labor power for a nationwide drive, dividing the union into 15 divisions that reflected 15 industrial areas. Even his critics conceded he was an organizational genius and a tireless leader who pushed the teamsters to the height of union power when he became president in 1952.
Today, the Teamsters have 1.3 million members.
In an interview in 1989, Mr. Beck said he had no idea what happened to Mr. Hoffa. "I don't know any more about it than the F.B.I., and they apparently don't know anything either," he said.
He also defended the image of a union that has seen several of its leaders go to prison and many of its locals taken over by federally appointed monitors.
"There is no truth in the world that the teamsters go hand-in-hand with gangsters," he said. "The only people I ever knew who were allegedly with the so-called gang were the business people we drove trucks for."
Mr. Beck is survived by his son, Dave Jr., three nephews and one niece.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 7, 1994, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Dec. 28 about the former Teamsters Union leader Dave Beck misstated the amount of time served in prison by his successor, James R. Hoffa. It was 4 years 9 months 16 days of a 13-year sentence, which was commuted by President Richard M. Nixon in 1971.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence in Economy Is Perking Up

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Cheered by better job prospects and rising incomes, consumers are feeling much more confident about the economy than they have in a long while.
The Conference Board confidence index jumped to 80.2 this month, from 71.9 in November, the business research organization reported yesterday. That followed a similar report by the University of Michigan, which told its clients privately earlier this month that its measure surged to 88.2 in the first half of December, from 81.2 in November. The Federal Government uses the Michigan figures in its forecasts of economic growth. 
 "Confidence is starting to come back," said Mark S. Herrmann, president of Mark Buick in Yonkers. "I'm much more optimistic about the short-term future than I was."
 
 
Spending Pause Is Possible
 How consumers feel this month is not necessarily a reliable gauge of how much they will spend next month -- witness the spending pause last winter that followed a burst of good feeling.
But economists say they are encouraged by the fact, evident in both surveys, that consumers are responding as much to a better here and now as to hopes of future improvement. Though this month's overall confidence readings are similar to last December's, consumers are far more upbeat about current conditions than they were back then.
And while only some forecasters are nudging up their estimates for the first quarter on the basis of the recent consumer readings, the restoration of confidence is at least reinforcing economists' predictions of continued moderate growth in the new year.
"If we didn't have this much momentum, I'd be more worried about the negative impact of the tax increases next year," Nicholas Perna, chief economist at the Shawmut National Corporation, said. "This momentum will enable us to get 3 percent growth in first half of 1994."
The outbreak of positive thinking is showing up in many parts of the country, from a small but steady stream of first-time home buyers in Tarrytown, N.Y., to crowded clothing stores in Tulsa, Okla.
Car sales, retail sales and home sales have all picked up in recent months. And yesterday's weekly Johnson Redbook survey of two dozen national retail chains showed that while sales were down in November from December on a seasonally adjusted basis, they were 10.1 percent higher this Christmas week than a year earlier.
There is no sign, either, that consumers have slacked off their spending since Dec. 25.
"The last couple of days have been awesome," said Leo M. Ragoza, general manager of Danbury Fair, the largest shopping complex in New England. "People not only returning, but buying. They are not holding back those dollars. They're spending cash. They're using a lot of plastic."
Mr. Ragoza says customers are turning more confident, which is less surprising considering that the jobless rate in Connecticut and elsewhere in New England has dropped sharply in the last year.
Most of the 230 stores in the mall sold more this season than last, Mr. Ragoza said, with some reporting "huge numbers." Another sign of confidence comes from what people are buying a lot of -- big ticket appliances, computers and furniture.
 
 
'Traffic Is Strong'
 At Woodland Hills Mall in Tulsa, the general manager, Mark F. Hunter, said that the 150 stores in his mall were reporting double-digit sales gains from a year earlier. And despite an undercurrent of concern among consumers about layoffs at American Airlines and McDonnell Douglas, two mainstays of Oklahoma's economy, Mr. Hunter said, "Traffic is strong now."
Nonetheless, there is almost no talk of a boom. Indeed, virtually all economists expect the growth of consumer spending -- especially on big-ticket items -- to cool in the first half of 1994 in large part because it has been so torrid lately.
"Spending on durables has really been ramping up," David Kelly, senior economist at Lehman Brothers Global Economics, said. "It's hard to maintain that pace of growth."
For one thing, consumers are spending money faster than they are making it and squeezing their saving rate to do so.
For another, there's President Clinton's tax increase, which caused no pain at all in 1993 -- nobody had to pay the extra tax right away -- but will show up in withholding next month.
Finally, some of the economy's strength is transient. Although most economists, including those in the Administration, look for the growth rate to reach 4 percent to 5 percent in the quarter that ends a few days from now, that strength includes auto makers' scramble to build up inventories as well as a return to normal activity after the flood in the Midwest.
Yet the evidence that economists are sifting makes them doubt that any slowdown in the first quarter will be as abrupt or as painful as it was last winter. Lower oil prices should restore most if not all of the purchasing power lost to tax increases. Flush retailers may well fire fewer than the usual million store clerks they have cut in past post-holiday seasons. And income growth, while not quite as fast as that of spending, has not trailed all that badly. Since a year ago, inflation-adjusted income has risen 2.8 percent while spending is up 3.5 percent.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Business Confidence Up
 WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 (AP) -- Business executives' confidence in the economy improved sharply in December to the highest level in eight months, the United States Chamber of Commerce said today. "The economy appears to have shed some of the cautiousness exhibited earlier this year and clearly stepped up a notch," the chamber's chief economist, Martin A. Regalia, said.
The chamber's business confidence index, reported every other month, was 54.3 in December, up from 46.4 in October,the highest level since April. A reading between 50 and 70 indicates moderate economic growth. In December, 8,594 executives responded to the survey.
The proportion of respondents expecting the economy to improve over the next six months nearly doubled, to 30.2 percent in December from 16.5 percent in October. Those expecting deterioration fell, to 26.2 percent of those surveyed from 42.2 percent.

HEADLINE: William L. Shirer, Author, Is Dead at 89

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:
William L. Shirer, the author of "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" and a foreign correspondent whose pioneering live trans-Atlantic radio broadcasts on the eve of World War II helped inform Americans about Nazi Germany, died yesterday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 89 years old and lived in Lenox, Mass.
His daughter Inga Dean of Lenox said he had been hospitalized since Dec. 5 with heart ailments, The Associated Press reported. 
 Mr. Shirer personified the hard-boiled Chicago style of journalism in the 1920's and 30's. But he was also a scholar fluent in German, French and Italian.
As a foreign correspondent in Paris, Berlin, Brussels, Amsterdam, Geneva, Rome, Vienna, the Balkans, the Middle East and India, he came to know world leaders, was frequently in the thick of things and occasionally made news himself.
 
Wrote History in Later Years
 While reporting the 1936 Olympics from Berlin, he was publicly condemned by Joseph Goebbels's propaganda ministry for exposing Nazi anti-Semitism.
"All Jew baiting is officially off in Germany during the Olympics," he wrote, because Hitler meant to turn the games into "a huge propaganda triumph." Mr. Shirer was accused of being a "German hater" and was threatened with expulsion.
In his later years, when he devoted himself to writing European history and his multivolume autobiography, "20th Century Journey: A Memoir of a Life and the Time," Mr. Shirer drew analogies between his past reporting experiences and present-day events. His popular 1960 history, "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich," traced the evils of Nazi Germany for millions of readers.
Mr. Shirer was also active in protecting the rights of writers. He served as president of the Authors Guild in the 1950's and remained an ex-officio member of the guild council until his death.
 
From Sports to Lindbergh
 William Lawrence Shirer was born in Chicago on Feb. 23, 1904, and received his early education in Chicago and in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. While studying at Coe College there, he got his first job in journalism as a sports reporter for The Cedar Rapids Republican. He graduated from Coe in 1925 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
Upon graduation, he left for Europe, working his way over by pitching hay on a cattle boat. Instead of returning home to what he called the land of "Prohibition, fundamentalism, puritanism and Coolidgeism," he went to work on the copy desk of the Paris edition of The Chicago Tribune. His seatmates there included James Thurber and Elliot Paul. He took courses in European history at the College de France and, in 1927, became European correspondent of The Chicago Tribune.
Among the events he covered were Charles A. Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927, the League of Nations sessions in Geneva and international sports events. From 1929 to 1932, he served in Vienna as chief of The Chicago Tribune's Central European bureau. His most challenging years were still ahead of him.
Roving around India and Afghanistan in 1930 and 1931, he began a long association with Mohandas K. Gandhi. "I spent much of my time traveling up and down the land with him," he said.
A skiing accident in the Alps in 1932 cost Mr. Shirer the sight in one eye. He left The Chicago Tribune and spent the next year as a free-lance writer in a fishing village in Spain. He and his Viennese wife, the former Theresa Stiberitz (they were married in 1931 and divorced in 1970), shared a house with the guitarist Andres Segovia.
In 1934, Mr. Shirer returned to Paris and went to work as the European correspondent for The New York Herald Tribune. He moved to Berlin in 1935 as a correspondent for Universal News Service. He remained at that post until William Randolph Hearst disbanded the service in 1937.
 
Job Offer From Murrow
 During those years, Mr. Shirer did occasional broadcasts for CBS Radio. In 1937, Edward R. Murrow, the chief of the network's new foreign staff in London, invited him to open an office in Vienna to report on the Continent. Turning down offers from American newspapers, Mr. Shirer began a second career as a broadcaster.
At first, William S. Paley, who founded CBS, insisted that Mr. Murrow and Mr. Shirer merely arrange for the broadcasts and use newspaper correspondents to go on the air. As Mr. Shirer noted in his memoirs, Mr. Paley contended that "for us to do the reporting ourselves would be to commit ourselves editorially." Eventually the network gave in, and the Murrow-Shirer broadcasts from London and the Continent made history.
Until 1941 and the German occupation of much of Europe, Mr. Shirer roamed from one capital to another, reporting on Hitler and the brutality of Nazism and Fascism. His observations of these tumultuous times later resulted in two books that served as warnings about totalitarianism: "Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent, 1934-1941," and his major work, "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."
 
History, Novels and Memoirs
 Mr. Shirer's other books included "End of a Berlin Diary" (1947), "The Western World Through Its Years of Conflict" (1952), "The Collapse of the Third Republic" (1969), "Gandhi: A Memoir" (1980), three volumes of memoirs, and several novels and books for juveniles.
Critics and readers considered his popular history outstanding. Writing about "The Collapse of the Third Republic," the syndicated book columnist John Barkham commented: "To waste no time about it, William Shirer has written as penetrating a history of the fall of France in World War II as he did of the decline and fall of Hitler's thousand-year Reich. Shirer is both a historian and journalist who brings an eyewitness record to his books."
Commenting on "The Nightmare Years," the second volume of Mr. Shirer's memoirs, John Chancellor, the NBC News correspondent, wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1984: "Mr. Shirer says that it was just a 'lucky break' that he was in Europe when the big events happened. Well, there is a saying in journalism: There are lazy reporters and there are lucky reporters, but there are no lazy lucky reporters. Mr. Shirer deserved his reporting triumphs."
Mr. Shirer continued to arouse controversy when the third volume of his memoirs, "A Native's Return," covering 1945 to 1988, was published in 1990. Former broadcasting colleagues challenged some of his assertions about why he was taken off the air by CBS.
In the book, Mr. Shirer wrote that he was relieved of his news analysis program in 1947, when he left CBS, because his liberal views displeased a sponsor and that Mr. Murrow as vice president for news and public affairs did not defend him to CBS management. The book is particularly critical of Mr. Paley. Defending Mr. Murrow, some CBS producers said the reason for Mr. Shirer's departure was that his ratings had declined. Mr. Shirer's criticism after he left CBS caused a rift in his friendship with Mr. Murrow, although in later years, Mr. Shirer wrote, they renewed their relationship.
After "A Native's Return" appeared, he also entered a dispute with his longtime publisher, Little, Brown, because of what he considered inadequate promotion. Mr. Shirer spent $17,000 of his own money to advertise his book in several newspapers. Mr. Shirer said that when the ads appeared, his relationship with Little, Brown deteriorated and his old publishing house rejected his next book, on the last days of Tolstoy. The A.P. quoted Ms. Dean as saying the book was to be published by Simon & Schuster in the spring.
 
Blacklist, Then a Book
 Although Mr. Shirer denied that he was ever a Communist sympathizer, he was blacklisted in "Red Channels," a booklet that listed names of suspected Communists in the early 1950's. He had once signed a friend-of-the-court brief for the Hollywood 10. "Red Channels" was used to pressure the networks and advertising agencies to purge its liberal commentators. CBS was one of the broadcasting companies that bowed to the pressure and established loyalty oaths.
"I became unemployable," Mr. Shirer later wrote. "I was broke, with two kids in school. Some of my friends were editors and would pay me for an article, but nothing was ever published. I then decided I would speak my piece on the lecture trail. I spent almost five years when my sole income was from one-night stands at universities. They were almost the only place in the country in the 1950's that still had some respect for freedom of speech."
Of colleagues who behaved "not well" during the McCarthy era, Mr. Shirer said: "It's a question of character. It's a complex fate, being an American, as Henry James wrote. It would be easier here for a right-wing dictator than anyplace else."
"I have moments of great depression about the United States," he added, "and then something happens to restore faith."
Had he not been blacklisted by the networks, Mr. Shirer said in an interview published in The New York Times Book Review in 1977, he would never have found the time to write "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."
In addition to Ms. Dean, Mr. Shirer is survived by his wife, Irina Lugovskaya; another daughter, Linda Rae of Cross River, N.Y., and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: India Booming as a Leader In Software for Computers

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India

 BODY:
Staring at his computer, his thumb drumming on his desk, Mohan Kumar tapped characters onto a screen to produce bits of the outline of the program for a vast global satellite telephone system being built by Motorola to change the face of mobile communications.
"India has a lot of talented engineers, but they aren't always doing the most advanced work," Mr. Kumar said. "Here we are on the cutting edge." 
 Since the late 1970's, American computer companies have been coming to India to take advantage of well-trained but relatively low-paid computer engineers. At Motorola, for instance, a mid-level engineer makes $800 a month, a fraction of what would be earned in the United States, Europe or Japan.
 
More Than 100 Companies
 But in recent years, the number of such operations has grown tremendously and has also begun to produce state-of-the-art work, including components for Motorola's hand-held satellite telephone system, known as Iridium. The system was conceived and designed in the United States, but Motorola officials say that in the last couple of years they have started to make some of its most advanced components in India.
With the growth of computer technology and software development in India, the southern city of Bangalore, about 500 miles southeast of Bombay, has become the hub of India's Silicon Valley, home to more than 100 computer software companies and hardware industries -- and perhaps tens of thousands of computer engineers.
Among the investors are I.B.M., Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard, Citicorp and Motorola. Only the United States and possibly Russia have more software engineers than India.
 
Middle Class Grows
 It used to be that the fastest thing around Bangalore was the race track, and even there, the horses ran more slowly than their European or American counterparts. A decade ago India built up its own space program with Bangalore as its center, and the city edged away from its somnolent roots.
Now, with the growth of the computer industry, the city has engendered a professional middle class with broad aspirations and talents. A pub culture, with people roaming from bar to bar in the evenings, has emerged here and nowhere else in India. The best hotels in India are in Bangalore, all with the most advanced services for business professionals. And despite this, the horse track with its not-so-fast horses is still here.
The manufacturing of computers in India is still tiny compared with other, faster-growing economies in Asia, but software production is rapidly becoming a major Indian export.
Software is the complex coded instructions that tell a computer what to do -- whether it is to compose a spreadsheet for a quarterly report, create a database for managing huge inventories, make it possible to use a notebook computer to write letters or, in the case of cellular phones, instruct the telephone how to interact with the transmitters.
As with Motorola's Iridium project, most of the software production in India is the writing of components of larger programs designed in the United States.
All engineering done for Motorola in India is contracted for by units of the company, principally in the United States, including those producing mobile radios, longer-distance cordless telephone systems being introduced in Hong Kong and Britain, cellular telephones and the still-gestating Iridium system.
 
Exports Are Soaring
 Eight years ago Indian software companies exported a mere $24 million in such programming. This year, an Indian trade group estimates that software products exported by both home-grown and foreign ventures based here will surpass $350 million, growing 55 percent from last year.
"We have a tremendous cost and quality advantage in India," said Dewang Mehta, the executive director of the National Association of Software and Services Companies, the major trade group in the country, referring to the lower Indian wage scale and the skill of the work force.
"We have a very high amount of trainable manpower, all English-speaking," he said. "This is really a sunrise industry in this country. Everybody is getting into it."
A good deal of the work done here is rated as routine, even mediocre programming. John C. Dvorak, a columnist for PC Magazine, recently wrote, "I've yet to see any decent code come out of India."
 
Quality of Work Cited
 But executives say that many companies are beginning to do work that rivals or exceeds that done anywhere in the United States, Europe or Asia. Among the leaders in that effort is Motorola's two-year-old software operation here.
The communications company, which has sites across the globe, has obtained the highest rating for its team under criteria established by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
Indeed, no other Motorola plant anywhere has managed to obtain an equivalent rating, and around the world only a handful of organizations have attained this standard.
From the outset, Motorola adopted a more cautious approach toward India compared with other computer and software companies.
"We wanted to set up in Asia," said Terence M. S. Heng, the director of external technology planning for the company, who was here recently. "There's no question that when one looked at India, one is struck by the very, very great excess of graduates."
Such an achievement may seem startling to those who associate India with grinding poverty and faltering Government institutions. But although India has failed to provide schooling for more than half its population, considerable Government resources have gone into a string of highly competitive science and technology universities around the country.
Despite India's reputation for cheap software engineering, Motorola's management insists that lower costs alone did not justify setting up in India.
"These are high-level software that drive our systems," said William V. Braun, Motorola's senior vice president and director of research and development. "This is not minor stuff that nobody wanted to do."
While the company had planned to grow to about 90 people in India in five years, there already are 155 engineers working on two floors of a newly built office building here.
 
Building a Future in India
 N. Srinivasa is one of the people Mr. Braun was looking for. Now a lead engineer for Motorola's operations here, Mr. Srinivasa completed his doctorate in computer science at the Indian Institute of Science here and did postdoctoral work at Purdue University in Indiana. An intense, earnest engineer who knew he could easily have found a job in the United States, he decided that his future lay in India, not abroad.
"I wanted to settle in India," he said. "I wanted to change from academics to industry. Motorola stood for developing quality products, so I thought it would be the right place."
But despite having access to some of India's most talented software engineers, Motorola's management remained concerned about its ability to control an operation 8,500 miles from corporate headquarters, particularly in a country with poor communications and difficult transportation links.
"We were prepared for it to fail," Mr. Braun said. "The key concern at the outset was quality. The key concern was how do you manage something so far away."
For Motorola, the rapid success of its operation here seems to demonstrate the wisdom of having come to India in the first place. But as Mr. Braun acknowledged, the company expects to be here for a long time to come, and there are no guarantees that the future will be so kind.
"The quality of the operation has exceeded our expectations," he said. "This organization has one year of a good track record, so we're not totally out of the woods."

HEADLINE: Woman Is Charged In Abuse of Children

 BODY:
A woman was arrested on child abuse charges last night after a fire broke out at her apartment in Union City, N.J., and the police discovered her six young children left alone.
The fire began in the second floor apartment of the six-family building about 4 P.M. and was brought under control about 6:30 P.M., said Detective Sgt. Brian Barrett of the Union City Police. None of the children and none of the neighbors were injured. 
 The woman, Sandra Rondon, 24, was arrested when she returned to the building, which was destroyed. Sergeant Barrett said Ms. Rondon is unemployed, and neighbors told the police that she frequently left her children at home unattended.
The children -- ages 1, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9 -- were taken to the Jersey City Medical Center for observation. The five boys and a girl will be released to the custody of the New Jersey Department of Youth and Family Services, Sergeant Barrett said.
Ms. Rondon was charged with six counts of child abuse for leaving the children alone, Sergeant Barrett said, adding that the children appeared to be healthy. She was scheduled to be arraigned this morning.
Sergeant Barrett said it was not clear where or how the fire began in the apartment.

HEADLINE: With a View of One Hemisphere, Latin America Is Freeing Its Own Trade

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec. 28

 BODY:
The North American Free Trade Agreement takes effect on Jan. 1, and that event is being seen in many Latin American countries as a first step toward the day when the pact expands south from Mexico, creating a free-trade hemisphere.
Overshadowed by the debate in the United States over job gains and losses from the North American accord, the economies of Latin America, a region long gripped by protectionism, have experienced a free-trade transformation of their own. 
 Taking North America's free-trade gospel to heart, Latin American nations are bulldozing tariff barriers with such energy that economists in the region predict that most trade within Latin America will be duty-free by the end of the decade.
Mexico is to join a second free trade pact next month. On Jan. 23, the presidents of Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela are to sign an agreement that phases out tariffs over a decade, creating a duty-free market of 150 million people.
Many Latin American leaders, recalling President George Bush's conception of a trade zone stretching from Alaska to Argentina, say that today's free market-directed policies are preparing their economies for a day when the North American trade zone expands south.
With approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, leaders of virtually every major Latin American nation except Brazil said their country should be next in line to join the North American trade bloc.
President Clinton has encouraged such hopes, saying, "I'll reach out to the other market-oriented democracies of Latin America to ask them to join in this great American pact."
Preparing for free trade with the United States, the average tariff charged by Latin American nations to outsiders has dropped to 15 percent, from 56 percent in 1985. This opening has made Latin America the world's fastest-growing market for goods made in the United States.
 
Some Specific Expectations
 With lower tariffs, United States exports to Latin America rose 27 percent in 1992. Latin America and Europe were the only two regions of the world where the United States had trade surpluses last year.
Half of Latin trade now is with the United States. A continental free trade pact would send duty-free American cars and computers to South America and would let United States consumers buy duty-free Colombian flowers, Chilean grapes and Argentine beef.
Of all the Latin American applicants to the North American group, Chile has the best prospects.
"President Clinton is committed to achieving a free-trade accord with Chile," said Alexander F. Watson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, in a recent speech to business people in Rio de Janeiro.
Chile would make an easy addition to the pact. Following a free market, export-driven model, it emerged from the dictatorship of the 1970's and 80's as Latin America's most robust economy. With expansion at an average rate of 8 percent a year since 1990, economists predict that Chile will reach the living standards of Spain in the next 10 years.
Earlier this year, Chilean officials began preliminary talks with the Clinton Administration. And since 1990, Chile has signed free-trade pacts with Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico.
United States officials are increasingly telling South Americans that the North American Free Trade Agreement is just the beginning.
"Most of it could happen before the end of the century," Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown recently said in Mexico with regard to a Western Hemisphere free-trade zone. "Venezuela, Chile and Argentina should be in the first wave of countries to be considered."
In the meantime, the regional building blocks of a hemispheric trade zone are taking shape.
Customs union, a dream since the end of Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule in the early 1800's, are integrating major geographic areas: Central America, the Caribbean, the Andean nations and the Southern Cone, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
 
Idea Already a Success
 Thus unfettered, intra-Latin commerce has surged. Trade among Latin America's 11 largest economies jumped 28 percent in 1992, reaching $19.4 billion. In the same year, Latin American exports to the rest of the world stagnated.
"The free-trade agreements have developed beyond all expectations," said Noemi Sanin, Foreign Minister of Colombia, a nation that is negotiating trade accords with 22 other Latin American countries. "Before the end of the century, we aspire to achieve the planet's most important trading bloc -- the American bloc."
This is no casual forecast. Timetables for tariff reduction indicate that most trade within Latin America will be tariff-free by the end of the 1990's, according to a study released in October by the Latin American Economic System, an inter-government organization based here.
Again and again, Latin America has proved that cutting tariffs and red tape results in surging trade.
In 1993, trade between Colombia and Venezuela reached $2 billion -- four times the level of 1991, the year before a duty-free customs union was established. Rules on product origin have been adopted to prevent the duty-free trans-shipment of Colombian and Venezuelan goods into the United States by way of Mexico.
After Colombia signed another customs union pact in 1992, its trade with Ecuador jumped by 50 percent in 1993, reaching $350 million.
Within the Andean region, trade increased 20 percent in 1992 -- the year Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia cut almost all regional tariffs to zero. In 1993, Andean trade surged 30 percent more, to $3 billion.
In the Southern Cone Common Market -- which has become known as Mercosur, shorthand for Southern Common Market -- regional trade grew more than 25 percent in 1993, reaching $9 billion. Trade was one-third that level in 1990, the year before Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay signed their agreement.
"Isolated countries have no destiny, no future," President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina told a regional financial group this month.
With regional tariffs scheduled to vanish in a year, Mercosur has proved so successful that Argentina is now Brazil's second-largest trading partner, after the United States. The share of Brazilian exports to other bloc countries rose from 4 percent in 1990 to 12 percent this year.
 
Argentine Labor Opposition
 Mercosur, which is Latin America's largest regional trade pact, faces high hurdles involving its largest nations, Brazil and Argentina.
The Argentine industrial union warned recently in a letter to President Menem that "if no safeguards are taken, Argentina's productive activity will be totally substituted by imports of Brazilian products." It asked a two-year delay in full tariff integration with Brazil.
To protect its industries, Argentina this year adopted a series of temporary measures against Brazilian imports. To reduce a trade surplus, Brazil increased oil imports from its southern neighbor, making Argentina its second-largest source of imported oil, after Saudi Arabia.
With Argentine officials saying their country could join the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1995, Brazil may be forced to adopt a more flexible negotiating position to preserve Mercosur.
"Brazilian products are invading Argentina," said Luiz Gonzaga Belluzzo, foreign affairs adviser to the governor of Sao Paulo state. "Menem wants to join Nafta because he wants to avoid being smashed by Brazil."
Of the South Americans, Brazil shows the least interest in joining the North American bloc. In September, at a regional heads of state meeting, President Itamar Franco blocked approval of a nonbinding motion of support for the accord. Instead, he offered a plan for "Merconorte," or Northern Common Market, a free trade pact for Brazil and its Amazon neighbors -- Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia.
Brazilians fear that under the North American accord, the United States will import duty-free from Mexico goods that are taxed when imported from Brazil -- orange juice, shoes, steel and automobile parts.
"More important than trade diversion, there will be investment diversion," said Carlos Langoni, who is the international studies director of the Getulio Vargas Foundation here. "For the next few years, Mexico will be the most interesting Latin American market for investors."
But the North American accord, Mr. Langoni said, gives powerful support for consolidating free-trade policies in Brazil, which, too, is emerging from decades of protectionism.
"In Brazil, there are still many businessmen asking for quotas, for protective tariffs," he said. "Nafta's approval will make it more difficult for Brazil to move away from trade liberalization."

HEADLINE: $1 Trillion in Health Costs Is Predicted

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON Dec. 28

 BODY:
The Commerce Department said today that health care spending in the United States would, for the first time, exceed $1 trillion next year.
Health spending will rise $118 billion, to $1.06 trillion, and will account for a record 15 percent of the nation's total output of goods and services next year, the department said. 
 Commerce Department officials said they foresaw robust growth for the industry even if Congress overhauled the health care system as President Clinton has proposed.
Health spending will total $942.5 billion this year and will rise 12.5 percent next year, the department said in its annual survey of major American industries.
 
Explaining Growth
 In recent months, the Labor Department has reported that the prices charged for medical goods and services appear to be rising more slowly than at any other time in nearly two decades. But the volume of medical services and procedures continues to increase, the elderly population is growing and the health care industry is continually introducing new medical technology.
 
Strong Growth Is Seen
 As a result, the Commerce Department said, total health spending is rising as fast as ever. Indeed, a rise of 12.5 percent next year would be bigger than any increase in more than a decade.
The Commerce Department's assessment came as part of a wide-ranging survey of American industries. It said that shipments of goods from American factories would show the fastest growth next year since 1988.
Of the 20 manufacturing industries that have grown the fastest from 1987 to 1994, nine sell health-related products, the department said.
Looking to 1994, the report said, "more small businesses and uninsured individuals will begin to gain greater access to health care services." Despite the Government's efforts to control health costs, it said, doctors, hospitals and other providers will "find alternative means to increase health care prices, shift prices, hoard inventories and incur capital costs to be passed on to consumers."
Even if new laws and competitive pressures restrain the prices of some health care goods and services in the United States, it said, there are still big potential export markets for American companies, the Commerce Department said. American companies already supply 52 percent of the world market for medical equipment and nearly 50 percent of the global pharmaceutical market, it said.
"Without reform," the report said, "health care expenditures are projected to rise by an average annual rate of growth of 13.5 percent during the next five years," and they will account for 18 percent of the gross domestic product in the year 2000.
Simon Francis, a Commerce Department economist who follows the health care industry, said, "The United States spends more on health care than any other industrialized nation, but a lower proportion of United States citizens have health insurance coverage, and a typical insurance policy provides less coverage than in any other industrialized nation."
 
Reasons for Disparity
 One reason for the disparity is that much of the care given in this country may be unneeded. "Some estimates put the level of unnecessary tests and procedures at $130 billion a year," Mr. Francis said.
In addition, regulation and administration add to health care costs in the United States. "Estimates of insurance overhead account for nearly 25 percent of total spending," the Commerce Department said. "By contrast, administrative costs in other industrialized countries total 11 percent or less."
The Commerce Department reported substantial increases in the number of people getting care through health maintenance organizations, which provide a wide variety of services in return for a flat monthly payment, set in advance. From 1987 to 1992, the department said, H.M.O. enrollment rose to 41.4 million, from 29.3 million. But the industry became more concentrated, and the number of H.M.O.'s declined, to 544 from 662.
 
Profits for H.M.O.'s
 Among the largest publicly traded health care companies, H.M.O.'s had "the highest overall profit gains" in the first quarter of 1993, the Commerce Department said.
"Outlays for hospital care are expected to increase 12.5 percent, to $409 billion" next year, it said. "Expenditures for physicians' services are expected to increase 11 percent, to an estimated $195 billion, while those for nursing home care will rise 12.5 percent, to $85.5 billion."
Home care, which provides medical and social services to people in their own homes, will be the fastest-growing sector of the health care industry, the department said. Spending for home care will rise 35 percent, to more than $22 billion in 1994, it said.
The Commerce Department said surgical appliances would be the third-fastest-growing manufacturing industry in the United States; its shipments are expected to rise 13 percent, to $18 billion next year. The only industries expected to grow faster are machine tools and electronic components.
Jeffrey L. Gren, a Commerce Department economist, said health care companies could benefit from efforts to guarantee health insurance for all Americans.
"Universal coverage will expand access to medical care, which will lead to an increase in demand for medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and health care services," Mr. Gren said. "Expanded prescription drug coverage will also increase demand."
Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer organization, said total health spending would double by the year 2000 if it rose at the rates foreseen by the Commerce Department.

Disney Says It Still Plans a 2d Southern California Park

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 28

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company, bruised by the unprofitable Euro Disneyland, has not backed off from its plans to build a second theme park in Southern California, a company executive says.
Mounting losses from Euro Disneyland and the recent departure of a key executive have prompted speculation that Disney may be reassessing its plans for the proposed $3 billion Westcot park. High development costs have also raised doubts about the project. 
 The Westcot park, which is behind schedule by at least a year, would be built next to the original Disneyland theme park in Anaheim and would be modeled on Disney's Epcot Center in Florida.
 
 
'Stand on Its Own'
 But Kenneth Wong, senior vice president of the Disney Development Company, said the company's interest in the project had not cooled. He denied that the problems at the Euro Disneyland park outside Paris had influenced the company.
"Every one of our projects has to stand on its own," Mr. Wong said in a recent interview. "The Westcot project will be evaluated on its own merits."
Euro Disneyland, whose parent company, Euro Disney, is 49 percent owned by Disney, has been losing money since opening in April 1992.
Mr. Wong said, however, that Disney had not yet determined if the Westcot project was economically feasible.
Although the State of California and the City of Anaheim have endorsed the project, Disney has said it would not be viable without substantial government financing for infrastructure costs.
Those costs, including such things as road improvements, landscaping and noise abatement, are estimated to represent about $750 million of the projected total cost of the project.
Mr. Wong said Disney was continuing to negotiate with Anaheim. He said the company planned to reconsider the project internally after the development proposal negotiations were concluded.
"That will be the first time that the project will be reconsidered for approval internally," Mr. Wong said.
 
 
'We Remain Optimistic'
 Bret Colson, a spokesman for Anaheim, said: "We remain optimistic that we can move the project forward. We are continuing to seek out sources of funding and continuing to explore various ways to finance the infrastructure." He declined to give details.
Speculation that Westcot might be losing its luster for Disney was also prompted by the resignation last week of Kerry Hunnewell, who had been manager of the project. Mr. Hunnewell had worked on the Westcot project for almost four years.
Mr. Wong said Mr. Hunnewell's departure did not reflect a change in Disney's attitude about the project.
Disney originally hoped to begin construction in the fall of 1993. The earliest construction could begin now would be next fall, Mr. Wong said.
If Disney decides to proceed with Westcot, construction of the first phase of the park would take six to seven years to complete, according to Mr. Wong.

A Critical Report
 BURBANK, Calif., Dec. 28 (AP) -- In unusually frank language in the company's annual report, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company, Michael Eisner, criticized the performance of the company's unprofitable Euro Disneyland venture.
In the report, made public today, Mr. Eisner said the French theme park is "our first real financial disappointment" since he took over the company more than a decade ago.
Mr. Eisner blamed the performance on Europe's recession and the strong French franc.
"For our part, we are working with all interested parties to help to restructure Euro Disney's financial condition," Mr. Eisner wrote. "But as we cannot shoulder the entire burden ourselves, other parties must bear their fair share."

HEADLINE: Giuliani May Shift Arts Financing To New York's Larger Institutions

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Describing the arts as an important element in New York's economic future, the incoming Giuliani administration plans to offer more support to the city's premier cultural institutions, possibly by cutting city aid to other less-established arts groups.
John S. Dyson, Rudolph W. Giuliani's deputy mayor for economic development and finance, said he would review the current roster of more than 431 arts groups that are getting $87.3 million this year in city assistance, to see how the administration might channel more aid to the more renowned institutions that attract tourist revenues. 
 "I think there's a lot of stuff going on because it's clubhouse-type political handouts," he said. "I don't know that but I want to find out."
"We have the best quality of art in the United States," Mr. Dyson added, "so the development question has to be quality, not a political standard."
 
Objects to Met Closings
 He said he did not yet know which institutions might lose under his proposal. But Mr. Dyson said he found it unacceptable that the Metropolitan Museum of Art has had to run taped telephone messages saying that "due to a reduction in city and state funding" some galleries are closed either mornings or afternoons midweek.
He compared the closings to the capricious hours of some European museums, saying, "It's like Italy -- sorry, we're closed except on leap years." He said, "When we get tourists here from Dubuque, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has to be open.
"What people come here to see are the finest things in the world and that's a source of hundreds of thousands of dollars in tourist revenue."
Mr. Dyson added that his emphasis on financing for top-quality institutions would not simply favor Manhattan, noting that the Brooklyn Museum, which has suffered from budget reductions, has an outstanding Egyptian collection. He also pointed to the New York Hall of Science in Queens, the Bronx Zoo, and the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. "It's not an outer-borough argument, it's a quality argument," he said.
But his suggestions were bound to further stoke the fires of what is already a heated annual debate over financing for the arts. Rochelle Slovin, the director of the American Museum of the Moving Image and chairwoman of the Cultural Institutions Group, representing 31 major arts institutions, said: "The issue is ultimately one of the total amount of resources available. It's a bit premature to be talking about taking away when in fact it's really a question of returning all of the cultural institutions and many of the programs to the levels we had a couple of years ago."
The city has long acknowledged that its concentration of cultural institutions is a boon to the local economy. In a study released in October, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey found that in 1992 the arts and other cultural activities in the metropolitan region generated almost $3.5 billion in wages, salaries and royalties, and were responsible for 107,000 jobs. It also found that the total economic impact on the region from the arts, counting spending by arts institutions, suppliers, wage earners, tourists and visitors, was $9.8 billion.
But in a signal that he wants to emphasize the economic development potential of arts and culture, Mr. Giuliani has shifted the city's Cultural Affairs Department into the portfolio of Mr. Dyson, instead of having it report to the deputy mayor for planning as it does now.
Mr. Giuliani said recently that culture and arts could be "a source of growth of the city if we do it right." Mr. Giuliani added that if city residents could come to view the cultural institutions as an area of growth and source of jobs, the perception could "create the political basis over a period of time to give more help to the arts."
 
More Money Called Unlikely
 Mr. Dyson acknowledged, however, that with the city facing a $2.2 billion budget gap in the next fiscal year, it is unlikely in the short term that more city money will be available for the arts.
He said he was hoping to put together a new program of corporate support for the arts that could be matched by city and state contributions to get major cultural institutions back to the financing levels of 1989, before recession-driven cuts in government support. "Rejiggering by itself will help, but will not help enough," he said. "We have to find some mechanism of restoring the budgets of these institutions and maintain them as an economic magnet that brings tourists to hotels, stores and restaurants."
Mr. Dyson spoke of his plans for the cultural affairs budget in an interview in which he set out his philosophy of how to bring economic growth and jobs to the city. "You start by keeping the people you have, not by bringing in new people," he said. "The second phase is making people here happy about us, and the third phase is we bring in more people who see that the people who are here are happy and the streets are safe."
 
Marketing City's Assets
 Like Mr. Giuliani, he said the city had to begin to reduce those taxes which make it uncompetitive, like the hotel occupancy tax, the unincorporated business tax and the commercial rent tax.
And Mr. Dyson, who as State Commerce Commissioner began the "I Love New York" campaign, said the city had to market its assets, like its huge labor pool, its concentration of leading research hospitals and its arts institutions.
His view of how to promote the city as a cultural mecca promised to be the most controversial effort.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art's president, William H. Luers, said the museum would need an additional $1.5 million to $2 million annually to insure that galleries would not have to be closed sporadically. But he expressed some discomfort at the idea that his museum might gain at the expense of others. "It's difficult," he said. "In fact, the biggest institutions are clearly the biggest draws in terms of tourists from outside the city, but the smaller institutions are part of a fabric that we all realize makes up the uniqueness of the city."
 
An Informal Formula
 Under an informal financing formula that has become a city tradition, the 31 major institutions that occupy city-owned real estate receive 85 percent of city financing and more than 400 other arts groups get 15 percent. Among the 31 institutions are the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, El Museo del Barrio, the Bronx County Historical Society and the New York Shakespeare Festival. The 400 arts grant recipients vary from local street theater groups, to restorations like Flushing Town Hall, to the Yeshiva University museum, to the Museum of Modern Art. The extent of the reliance on city aid varies among the institutions, with the larger ones able to turn to private donors, admissions and endowments.
Earlier this year Mr. Dinkins's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, Luis R. Cancel, proposed increases for only 13 of the 31 major institutions, passing over the City Center and the American Museum of Natural History for smaller museums like the Bronx Museum and El Museo del Barrio in Manhattan. He said the money available was too limited to be spread across the board.
"One of the things I know Commissioner Cancel wanted to be remembered about is the importance of diversity," said his spokeswoman, Carole Sorell. "He just feels it's important besides European culture to begin to learn about other cultures and to value them. That's what he tried to do. Not that the Met isn't important -- it's very important."
In a bitter budget battle, the Council threatened to dissolve Mr. Cancel's department. Ultimately, after the Council restored money to the culture budget, the traditional financing formula was maintained and increases were more evenly apportioned.

HEADLINE: California Trails U.S. in Growth

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
For the first time in two decades, California's population is growing slower than the nation's as a whole, the Census Bureau said today.
Last July 1 there were 257.9 million Americans, 2.8 million more than a year earlier. That translates into a population increase of 1.1 percent. Nearly a third of the growth, 894,000 people, was the result of migration from other countries, the bureau said. Births accounted for the rest. 
 But California's population lagged slightly behind the nation's as a whole, growing by 1 percent, to 31.2 million. Immigrants from abroad accounted for 95 percent of the state's growth.
In the 1980's, California grew twice as fast as the nation. But in recent years California's huge aerospace industry has shrunk as the military cut purchasing after the cold war ended. Heavy immigration has also contributed to a rapid growth in the number of people looking for jobs.
"There are no longer rumors floating around elsewhere in the United States that you can come to California and get a good job," said Peter Morrison, a demographer with the Rand Corporation, a research institute in Santa Monica, Calif.
Many Californians are migrating to states nearby like Washington, Oregon and Arizona, Mr. Morrison said, adding that newcomers to California are mainly younger people who provide a good work force for future growth. "They're more like unemployed college graduates than economic refugees," he said.
Nationwide, Nevada was the fastest growing state, at 3.9 percent, followed by Idaho, at 3.1 percent, and Colorado, 2.9 percent.
Two states, Connecticut and Rhode Island, lost population, by one-tenth of 1 percent each. The District of Columbia also lost population, by 1.2 percent.
The West was the nation's fastest growing region, at 1.7 percent, followed by the South, 1.4 percent, the Midwest, seven-tenths of 1 percent, and the Northeast, at one-half of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: An Immigrant Is Helped by the Neediest Cases Fund

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
When Ana Marin first set foot on American soil, she could barely see her new country. It was the middle of the night and she had just carried her infant daughter and young son for miles through the hills that descend into the small towns south of San Diego.
Along with dozens of other Mexicans and Central Americans that night in late 1981, she followed a "coyote," or immigrant smuggler, across the border. The members of the crossing party, called "pollos," or chickens, by the smugglers, were given no guarantee that the several hundred dollars they had each paid would guarantee their safe passage. 
 "But I had to come, because there was no work where I lived," said Ms. Marin, who hitchhiked to Tijuana after leaving her home in Guatemala. "You have nothing if you are from where I lived."
For Ms. Marin, like thousands of other illegal immigrants, the United States has not offered much more in the way of prosperity. In September 1982, she arrived in Brooklyn and worked at a factory for $3 an hour, packing shirt buttons into boxes.
At first, New York was an exciting and frightening place. "I thought it was very nice," Ms. Marin said, in halting English. "But I was scared too because of the tall buildings. In California, nothing was so tall."
Soon, the city's glittery image faded as Ms. Marin settled into a daily struggle to survive. Even with the legal status she received as a result of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, she found she could not make enough to feed her children and pay her rent.
For a time in 1990, after having to quit her job and flee her apartment because her boyfriend was beating her, she lived in a private shelter in Queens. Her unemployment checks were too small to pay a security deposit and first month's rent on an apartment, so she moved out of the shelter into one small room in a Bronx apartment building.
When she found out that she was pregnant again, however, the fragile hold she had on her life fell apart. Ms. Marin's daughter, Jasmine, was born nearly three months premature with underdeveloped lungs. Officials at the hospital told Ms. Marin they would not release the baby to her if she could not find better housing for her children.
In an effort to keep Jasmine out of foster care, hospital and city housing officials referred Ms. Marin to the Community Service Society, one of seven charities assisted by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
The fund is conducting its 82d annual appeal for donations to help the agencies help single mothers like Ms. Marin and countless other people who live in the city without housing, medical care or enough food. The donations sent in by thousands from New York and around the world are given directly to the charities because The Times pays all of the campaign's administrative costs.
As the result of aggressive advocacy by the Community Service Society to get Ms. Marin a housing subsidy from the city's Child Welfare Administration, she is now living in a three-bedroom clapboard house with a lawn in Far Rockaway, Queens.
Her struggle to pull herself out of poverty is far from over. She still lives on public assistance. She also suffers from epileptic seizures, and recently, burned her arm when she collapsed on the stove while cooking.
But despite everything -- despite even the fact that she could not afford a Christmas tree -- she still manages a broad smile when she speaks of keeping her family together.
"That is the thing that comes first," she said. "Everything else will come with time."

HEADLINE: Dow and S.& P. Edge Up to New Records

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Stocks inched higher yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index both touching new highs for a second day.
But in contrast to the situation on Monday, the records set yesterday were modest achievements. The Dow closed at 3,793.77, up 84-hundredths of a point, while the S.& P. 500 index closed at 470.94, up four-tenths of a point. 
 Meanwhile, the Nasdaq market showed a bit more vibrance, with its composite index advancing 3.50 points, to 764.56.
 
Advances Outnumber Declines
 Advances exceeded declines by 1,217 to 825 on a day when turnover continued at a low level during this holiday trading period. But yesterday's volume of 203.8 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange topped Monday's slow trading of 171.2 million shares. The Dow transportation average also rallied to a record of 1,775.61, up 5.14.
"I liked the tone of the thing," said John H. Shaughnessy, senior vice president of Advest Inc. "The breadth was definitely positive and it was a good, solid day."
Among the news developments affecting the stock market was a report that the Conference Board's consumer confidence index jumped more than 8 points this month to 80.2 -- its highest point in almost three years. In addition, the December survey of retail sales by the Johnson Redbook Service showed an increase at a seasonally adjusted rate of 8.1 percent over the year-earlier period.
Some retail stocks reacted positively to these developments. Wal-Mart Stores and May Department Stores were both on the Big Board's most active list, with the former gaining 3/8, to 26 1/8 and the later increasing 3/8, to 39 5/8.
Many economically sensitive cyclical stocks, closely tied to the rises and falls of the economy, moved to higher ground. Automobile shares particularly reflected investor optimism, as Chrysler -- which received a boost yesterday in a report from S. G. Warburg & Company -- rose 5/8, to 53 7/8, General Motors gained 1/2, to 56 3/4 and Ford advanced 1/4, to 64 3/4.
Airlines were strong during the day, apparently benefiting from weak oil prices and rising traffic. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, was up 1/4, to 67 7/8 and UAL, the parent of United Airlines, was up 5/8, to 148 1/8.
 
Food Stocks Turn Lower
 Also showing strength were the high-technology stocks, with analysts noting that shipments of computer chips are expected to be higher in 1994. Motorola rose 1/2, to 91 7/8, Texas Instruments increased 1/2, to 63 1/8, Advanced Mirco Devices gained 5/8, to 18 1/8 and Micron Technology climbed 1/4, to 46 3/8.
In contrast, some food stocks turned lower. H. J. Heinz declined 1/8, to 36 and Ralston-Purina slumped 1/2, to 39 1/8.
Foundation Health also wound up on the down side, dropping 5/8, to 29 3/4 after the Defense Department decided not to award the company a $3.5 billion contract for health-care to military dependents in California and Hawaii. And Oracle Systems, plagued by concern over its earnings outlook, declined for the fourth consecutive day by falling 7/8, to 29.
On the plus side, Cabletron Systems increased 1 3/8, to 112 1/8, following the signing of an agreement to sell computer newtwork products in Southeast Asia and Australia.
Closed-end country funds consisting of companies in emerging markets, which turned in a good performance on Monday, did so once more yesterday, including the Chile Fund, up 1 5/8, to 46 3/8 and the Thai Capital Fund, up 1 1/8, to 22 7/8.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Raises Its Estimate of Tax Cheating

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
Americans cheat the Government out of about $150 billion a year in taxes -- enough to cover three-fifths of the Federal budget deficit -- the Internal Revenue Service said today.
This is far more than it estimated as recently as last month.
In an appearance before Congress in November, Margaret Milner Richardson, the I.R.S. Commissioner appointed by President Clinton, put the "tax gap" at some $119 billion. But now that the agency has widened its net beyond income taxes -- mainly adding payroll levies and excise levies on items like gasoline, guns, luxury cars and fishing rods -- it has come up with the higher figure. 
 It expects to publish a formal report on these other aspects of evasion by mid-1994.
The scrutiny of the broader range of taxes is seen as part of increased enforcement efforts. This month the agency announced a plan under which it would consolidate customer-service and returns processing, transferring many people now in clerical jobs to front-line compliance jobs.
A major goal is to raise what the I.R.S. calls its voluntary compliance rate, now 82 percent, to 90 percent by the 21st century. Fewer than 1 percent of individual returns have been audited in recent years -- 91-hundredths of a percent of those filed in 1992.
The I.R.S. has also begun taking a more realistic view of its receivables -- the money that taxpayers acknowledge they owe, or the taxes that the Government levies on nonfilers or other recalcitrants but that remains unpaid. It is acknowledging that much of what is carried on its books can never be collected. For 1992, the only year so far estimated, it thinks it will eventually collect $22 billion of $70.9 billion now listed as owed.
The tax gap and receivables are not the same. The tax gap consists of how much extra revenue the I.R.S. should get if everybody reported all regular and moonlight income and nobody overstated deductions. It includes much of the so-called underground economy but not income from illegal activities like drug dealing.
The $150 billion gap figure was disclosed today by Commissioner Richardson at a briefing to begin the new tax-filing season. On Monday, postal employees are to start delivering more than 86 million packages of 1993 forms.
While the I.R.S. did not specifically contend today that tax cheating was on the rise, it has repeatedly expressed concern that the system is perceived as overly complex and unfair to the honest taxpayer, thereby undermining compliance.
In its latest annual report, it listed improved compliance as its "first major goal," saying it had to supplement traditional enforcement methods with new approaches. Among these are initiatives that for example, alert new businesses to tax responsibilities before they break the law.
"Experience has proved that our traditional enforcement approach alone cannot sustain appropriate compliance levels," the annual report declared.
 
Emphasizing the Positive
 At a time when many analysts are saying that tax increases enacted last summer are likely to slow economic growth again in early 1994, Commissioner Richardson sought today to emphasize the relatively small proportion of affected taxpayers.
"Despite the publicity about higher tax rates for 1993, the fact is that fewer than 2 percent of individual taxpayers will be in the new 36 or 39.6 percent tax brackets," she said. And those few, she said, may pay their additional 1993 levies in three annual interest-free installments.
The 36 percent rate begins at $115,000 for single taxpayers and $140,000 for a married couple filing jointly. A 10 percent surcharge kicks in at $250,000 for singles, heads of household and joint returns.
Among new developments this filing season are:
*About 2.5 million couples without dependents whose taxable incomes are under $50,000 will be able to use Form 1040EZ, the simplest form, previously limited to single people.
*The check-off for the Presidential election campaign fund rises to $3 from $1.
*Schedule D for capital gains and losses is 35 lines shorter, and five million self-employed people will no longer need to complete form 4562 on depreciation of business vehicles
*Filing returns by telephone, tried in a two-year experiment in Ohio, is being expanded to Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, South Carolina and West Virginia. In southern Ohio, telephone filing will now involve a voice "signature" attesting to a return's correctness.
*Taxpayers in 23 states, including New York, will be able to file Federal and state returns electronically in one transmission to the I.R.S., up from 15 states last year.
The I.R.S. also said it had begun a pilot program to provide forms in other than English. In Southern California and South Florida it is testing a Form 1040A in Spanish.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Cheap Oil Fails to Energize Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Treasury securities were mixed yesterday in another day of subdued trading.
The market was supported to some degree by lower oil and other commodity prices, which lessened fears of any imminent resurgence of inflation. 
 An unexpected jump in the consumer-confidence data for December was largely shrugged off.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 2/32 , to 1008/32 , with its yield remaining at 6.23 percent, unchanged from Monday.
Prices of most Treasury securities sagged in early trading as market participants noted some selling in overseas accounts linked to a strong dollar and to profit-taking. With Monday's lackluster trading attitude spilling into yesterday's market, the bond market lacked significant trends.
"There are certainly more sellers than buyers," a trader said, "but that just means there are three people selling and two buying."
 
Consumer Confidence Rises
 Bond prices were temporarily weakened after the sharp surge in the Conference Board's December consumer-confidence index, to 80.2 from a revised 71.9 in November. While the report was beyond expectations, analysts said it was not devastating to the market because the trend had already been anticipated from earlier surveys by the University of Michigan and ABC/Money Magazine.
Economists also pointed out that the confidence index was only loosely tied to consumer spending habits, which are the prime movers of the economy.
Analysts at MMS International said prices of shorter-maturity issues continued to be stronger than those of longer maturities because most investors and traders had moved into a holding pattern of shorter-maturity obligations until mid-January.
Stephen Gallagher, money market economist at Kidder, Peabody & Company, said that yesterday's market was typical of holiday periods.
"The market experienced some down trading after the consumer confidence report, but received support from market participants entering to do some buying at the lower prices and by others covering short positions," he said. In covering short positions, investors buy securities to repay those previously borrowed and sold at prevailing prices in hope of future price declines. Rising prices generally set off such short-covering.
 
Oil Falls Further
 In addition to the short-covering, commodity and oil prices were down, Mr. Gallagher noted. "The fact oil fell below $14 a barrel late in the day encouraged Treasuries and helped them recover all their losses," he said.
The Johnson Redbook data of retail sales for December released yesterday afternoon was mixed but encouraging for retailers, Mr. Gallagher said. The report showed a decline of eight-tenths of a percent, but an 8.1 percent rise from a year earlier.
Mr. Gallagher noted that the numbers covered the period up to Christmas Day, with the days after Christmas still to be reported. That data, he said, had proved important over the last few years.
Also yesterday, the Treasury announced plans to sell $25.2 million of three-month and six-month bills on Monday at its regular weekly auction. The previous auction was for $26 billion.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed Despite Signs Of Economic Gains in U.S.

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against most leading currencies in light trading yesterday despite new signs of economic strength in the United States. The absence of the London foreign-exchange market, closed for the holidays, contributed to the quiet trading.
The Conference Board reported that consumer confidence jumped sharply in December, but the figures gave the dollar only a brief boost. 
 "There's no follow-through because there are no players around," said Tom Moore, senior director for American Express.
The dollar eased to 111.43 Japanese yen in late New York trading, from 111.45 late Monday. It also fell to 1.6980 German marks, from 1.7015.
Gold prices were also lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery, the most active futures contract, lost 60 cents to $388.50 an ounce.
The dollar has been trying this week to regain its footing against the yen after a selloff last week spurred by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who said recent fluctuations in the dollar-yen rate were causing concern that Japan was not sticking to its commitment to trim the trade deficit.
Expectations that the Clinton Administration might adopt a "strong yen" policy to discourage American consumers from buying Japanese imports and to cut the country's huge trade deficit with Japan are keeping a lid on the dollar, dealers said.
Yesterday, Treasury Under Secretary Lawrence Summers pressed Japan to live up to an international commitment it had made on semiconductor trade, which calls for Japan to buy 20 percent of its semiconductors from foreign sources.
One dealer said that if trade relations with Japan soured further the dollar could fall as low as 90 to 110 yen. Conversely, many currency dealers are projecting it to hit 112 yen in early 1994 based on the fundamentals of a strong American economy compared with a weak Japanese economy.
The dollar closed in New York at 1.3310 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3275 on Monday. The British pound closed in New York at $1.5085, up from $1.5045 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Monday's quotes, included: 1.4380 Swiss francs, down from 1.4430; 5.7880 French francs, up from 5.7945, and 1,679 Italian lire, up from 1,676.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Analysts say Kent Electronics can endure any economic phase.

BYLINE: By Robert Hurtado

 BODY:
SETTING recent buoyant economic news aside, many large investors recommend looking for stocks than can appreciate in almost any phase of the economy's cycle.
One that seems to fit the profile, some Wall Street professionals say, is the Kent Electronics Corporation, a Houston-based distributor of electronics components. "Economic phases wax and wane, but Kent keeps chugging along," Mark Plummer, an analyst with Stephens Inc., said. Indeed, the company has reported 30 consecutive quarters of increased sales and earnings since its initial public offering in June 1986. 
 Like the rest of the industry, Kent has benefited as component makers have increased their reliance on distributors, rather than selling direct, to build market share and control costs. For instance, AMP Inc., the world's largest producer of electronic connectors, named Kent in the fall of 1992 as one of its four nationally authorized distributors.
Kent has avoided the highly volatile semiconductor business and instead supplies components like resistors, capacitors and connectors -- a more stable but still growing market, analysts said. Last year, distributors sold more than $6.2 billion of these types of parts in the United States.
For the year that ended on March 31, Kent had revenues of $154.7 million, with two-thirds derived from component sales and the rest from the company's growing contract-manufacturing business. In those operations, Kent provides custom-built electronic units to original equipment manufacturers in industries like telecommunications, medical devices, energy, computers and data processing.
"Kent's expertise in contract manufacturing plays right into the rapidly growing outsourcing market, where equipment makers rely on outside vendors to supply assembled parts that meet specifications," Carlene Murphy, a portfolio manager for Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management, said. "Driving original equipment manufacturers to the outsourcing of engineered product systems and subsystems is the growing realization that American business must dedicate finite resources to strategic priorities, such as new product development, reduced inventory risk and improved operating efficiencies."
Analysts say Kent's contract-manufacturing business has grown at an annual rate of 33 percent during the last five years and they expect yearly growth to exceed 25 percent in 1994 and 1995. Earlier this year, Kent reported that gross margins for contract manufacturing dipped slightly because of some pricing pressure, but Wall Street believes margins have settled to a range of 26 to 27 percent, compared with historic levels of 27.5 percent.
Acquisitions are considered another important avenue for growth. Electronics distribution is a highly fragmented business, with about 1,500 small operators. Kent, which has a balance sheet free of debt and $27 million in cash, is considered by some market analysts to be well positioned as an acquirer. Indeed, the company has completed three acquisitions in the last six years. Each contributed immediately to earnings and increased the company's geographic reach. Since the last deal was made almost two years ago, some large investors think Kent is again on the prowl.
Investor interest helped to drive the stock to a new high of $28.75 a share on Dec. 8 in New York Stock Exchange trading. It closed yesterday at $27.125 a share, up 25 cents. Without including potential acquisitions, earnings, which were $1.20 a share in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, are expected to increase to $1.45 a share in 1994 and $1.75 a share in 1995, according to a Bear, Stearns & Company research report.

HEADLINE: Japan's Trade Surplus Ebbs

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 28

 BODY:
Japan's balance-of-payments surplus fell in November because of the strong yen, the first year-on-year decline in six months, the Finance Ministry said today.
The surplus in current accounts, a broader measure of trade and services, narrowed to $8.21 billion without adjustment for seasonal factors, from $10.34 billion a year earlier. 
 Economists said this could signal the end of a long rise in the surplus, adding that it was likely to continue shrinking because of the strong yen.
The trade surplus shrank to $9.05 billion last month from $9.57 billion a year earlier and $12.43 billion in October, the Finance Ministry said.
Economists said a dwindling surplus had not previously been apparent in dollar figures because the strong yen inflated the dollar value of Japanese exports. But now the yen's rise is putting enough pressure on Japan's export volume to cut the surplus in dollar terms.
A ministry official declined to say that the dollar-based current-account surplus was definitely on a downward trend. He said currency rates, crude oil prices and the broad domestic and foreign economic situations must still be watched.
Japanese products lost competitiveness in the world market as the yen traded at 108.82 to the dollar by the end of November, compared with 124.75 a year earlier. The yen's strength increased imports in November by making them cheaper.
The current-account surplus with the United States totaled $22.74 billion in the six months from January through June 1993, up from $19.65 billion a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
More than two years after the recession officially ended, the wheels of industry will start humming in 1994, the Government predicted today.
In its 35th annual forecast of winners and losers in American industry, the Commerce Department said prospects were bright for makers of automobiles, computers, factory machinery and home appliances. 
 Prospects were at least mildly positive for nearly every industry except military contractors. Of 136 manufacturing industries surveyed, 121 were expected to show increasing sales.
"We anticipate the fastest expansion in manufacturers' shipments since 1988," said Jeffrey E. Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade.
Over all, the department's forecast, called the United States Industrial Outlook, projected an inflation-adjusted median growth rate in manufacturers' shipments of 2.8 percent, meaning half would see faster growth and half slower.
That compares with gains of 2 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 1992 and a decline of 3.7 percent in 1991, the year the recession ended. If realized, the predicted 1994 advance would be the third consecutive gain and the largest in six years.
Despite the prospect for higher shipments, 60 of the 121 manufacturing industries projecting growth are expected to cut employment.
They are achieving higher output by modernizing and computerizing their production. Payrolls in the fast-growing electronic component manufacturing business, for instance, are expected to shrink 2 percent.
The 1993 648-page outlook, prepared by more than 130 Government analysts, will be sold at Federal bookstores.

 BODY:
Bye, bye Betsy: More than 300 of BETSY GOTBAUM'S friends and colleagues at New York City's Department of Parks and Recreation, who are known as "parkies," will gather tonight at the Loeb Boathouse in Central Park to bid her farewell the department's Commissioner.
The party was originally planned to celebrate Ms. Gotbaum's four years on the job, said STEWART DESMOND, a Parks Department spokesman, "but there was some thought it might turn into a farewell." 
 Although Ms. Gotbaum said she expected the party to be a nostalgic occasion, organizers hope to keep the mood upbeat, planning what Mr. Desmond characterized as "a wild bash with Brazilian music."
Ms. Gotbaum said: "This is sort of bittersweet and very, very sad, but that's life. I love the agency and all the people, and, yes, I had hoped to stay on."
She will be succeeded by her immediate predecessor, Henry J. Stern, who served as Parks Commissioner for seven years under Mayor Edward I. Koch and who wanted to remain on the job when Mayor David N. Dinkins tapped Ms. Gotbaum four years ago. "I was interviewed, but they decided that was not what they wanted to do," she said, referring to the Giuliani administration.
"I have no idea what I will do next; not a clue," she added, noting that her husband, Victor Gotbaum, the former labor leader who resigned from the Board of Education last month, was out of a job as well. "You have the two unemployed Gotbaums," she said. "Any suggestions what we can do?"
Meanwhile, she had lunch yesterday with Mr. Stern at Fresco, the restaurant on East 52d Street. "I took him," she said. "It was the gracious thing to do."

HEADLINE: ...And Knowing What to Look For

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
"THERE are some real caviar connoisseurs in New York City," said Rod Mitchell, a seafood and caviar dealer in Portland, Me. His company, Browne Trading, sells mostly to restaurants, but he was talking about discerning private clients who order generous tins of caviar week in and week out.
They do not wait for New Year's Eve to splurge and eat a bit of caviar. 
 But for most people, even those who adore the glistening roe of the sturgeon (the only kind that can legally be called caviar without identifying the type of fish, as in lumpfish caviar), fine caviar is an infrequent treat. Maybe a canape or two at a wedding reception -- unless it's a Trump wedding with heaps of it on hand -- or some sybaritic spoonfuls at year's end. And for those who have not made caviar a habit, buying it always seems to be somewhat puzzling, a little like shopping for good jewelry.
Do you go to Tiffany's, knowing it will be expensive but reliable, or do you look for a bargain on Canal Street? For caviar there are also numerous top-of-the-line retailers like Petrossian and Caviarteria and mail-order companies like Browne Trading. But what about those dealers with rock-bottom prices, sevruga for a song?
These days there seems to be more bargain caviar than ever. Prices in general are lower than they were a few years ago, even at Petrossian. Some of the low prices at places like Macy's and Zabar's are loss-leaders in the usual year-end price wars. Others are offered by wholesalers who also sell retail.
How does all this caviar from different sources, some with prices half those of others, measure up? Which is the one to buy for New Year's? Samples of sevruga caviar, purchased from 11 retail, wholesale and mail-order sources, were tasted at The New York Times last week.
Not included in the tasting were the inexpensive little tins of caviar ($4 to $5 an ounce) that have to be opened with a can-opener and have labels entirely in Russian now being sold at delicatessens in the Brighton Beach area of Brooklyn, home to many Russian immigrants. This is black market caviar intended only for domestic consumption in Russia and smuggled out in someone's suitcase. A hundred years ago immigrants brought their diamonds. Now they bring fish eggs. But chances are it has not been kept refrigerated. Chances are it is not worthy of your Champagne.
Sevruga is the smallest, most abundant and, at $20 an ounce or less, the least expensive of the three major kinds of Caspian Sea sturgeon. Ossetra caviar is from a larger type of sturgeon with larger eggs that are often grayish or brownish and have an earthier, more nutty flavor. These days ossetra caviar costs about 20 percent more than sevruga.
Beluga, the most prized, is the rarest kind, with the largest, most delicate eggs. It comes from giant beluga sturgeon that can weigh as much as a ton. An ounce of beluga will set you back at least $50. Within each of these categories there are various grades.
The caviars that were tasted had typically small eggs, with some brands beautifully uniform and unbroken. Others were uneven, messy and downright soupy, evidence that they might have been badly handled, or were probably not as fresh as they should have been and certainly would not have provided that satisfying "pop," the sensation of a delicate bubble bursting when pressed gently against the roof of the mouth.
The way the caviar appears in a freshly opened tin is a good clue to texture, which is almost as critical as flavor. The eggs should be glossy and uniform in size, unbroken and not sitting in oily goo. Color is of secondary importance.
The flavor should be clean and balanced, with a light oceanic saltiness that may be more pronounced in sevruga than in the other kinds of Caspian Sea caviars but never overwhelming. A sweetness, nuttiness and earthiness are other desirable characteristics. Metallic, musty or acrid flavors and mushy, gritty or overly sticky textures are not.
Freshness is critical to the quality of fine caviar. In the Caspian Sea there are two annual sturgeon catches, spring and fall. The freshest caviar on the market today would ideally be from this fall's catch in October and November, which takes a month or so after being cleaned and lightly salted to reach the United States market. Aside from the celebratory aspect, that is why New Year's is a good time to buy caviar. And the turnover in shops during the holidays is the largest, another reason the caviar is likely to be fresher.
Pasteurized caviar, sold in glass jars that do not require refrigeration until they are opened, never has the oceanic delicacy or the elegant, barely resilient yet moist texture of the finest fresh kind.
Once purchased, a tin of fresh caviar (or a jar of it -- quantities of less than three ounces usually come in thick little jars) can be kept unopened in the coldest part of the refrigerator (but not the freezer) for up to a month without deteriorating. The best way to keep it is to place the tin directly on a frozen gel pack, changing the pack as it defrosts. An opened tin is best used in a single sitting. Any unused portion can be kept for another day or so if the surface is smoothed, a piece of plastic wrap is placed directly on it and it is kept in the coldest part of the refrigerator.
This year, Zabar's, a reliable store that sells about 5,000 pounds of caviar during the holiday season, has posted a sign advising customers to use their caviar within seven days of purchase. Murray Klein, one of the owners, said it was a precaution, because home refrigerators often do not keep the caviar cold enough, and had nothing to do with the freshness of the caviar they were selling.
All the players in the caviar pipeline insist their caviar is fresh, from the latest catch. But some say there are stocks of caviar from the 1991 and 1992 harvests in storage in Russia and Germany. "A great deal of the caviar that is supposedly fresh may be two, even three years old," said Bruce Sobol of Caviarteria in Manhattan. Kept under the proper commercial cold-storage conditions, some of it might still be acceptable but some will inevitably have become mushy or excessively salty.
Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union the caviar business has become increasingly byzantine, with slick entrepreneurs jumping on the bandwagon of an industry that was once under tight Soviet control. There are reports of Russian fishermen salting fresh caviar in their bathtubs and selling it to shady operators. "It's a mess over there right now," Mr. Mitchell, the caviar dealer, said.
Top importers like Petrossian and Caviarteria have agents in Russia selecting caviar. Others deal with reliable brokers in Hamburg, Germany, and, increasingly, in Poland.
Russia produces most of the Caspian Sea caviar, a harvest that this year is expected to amount to about 230 tons, less than 10 percent of what it was in the 1970's. Small amounts of caviar are being produced in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. Iranian production, which used to account for a sizable portion of the harvest, dropped precipitously after the revolution there in 1979 and remains small. Overfishing has also affected production tremendously, and the Russians are desperately trying to restock the Caspian Sea with sturgeon fingerlings.
"Even though production is low the prices have not gone up because there is so much in storage," Mr. Mitchell said. "But once that caviar is gone and dealers have to rely on the annual catch you'll probably see prices double."
This year, the market has been enhanced by sturgeon caviar from the Amur River in Siberia, from a huge sturgeon closely related to the beluga, but not the same. A few years back it was coming in from the other side of the same river in China.
The eggs look like top-of-the-line beluga, pewter gray, large, glossy and separate. Their texture is also first rate, but the flavor is somewhat saltier, less delicate and complex than true beluga. The caviar does have a nice sweetness in the aftertaste and, for a price comparable to that of sevruga, this caviar, often called keluga, is undeniably a very good buy, especially since it is likely to be reliably fresh.
Are some dealers selling this caviar as Caspian Sea beluga, as others suggest, and charging top dollar? Rumors hinting at unsavory practices are as much a part of the caviar business as year-end sales. Bal ducci's, among others, incorrectly advertises it as "beluga," even though it properly gives its source as either Russia or the Amur River and sells it for a quarter of the price of beluga.
For those who do not want to splurge on Caspian Sea or Amur River sturgeon caviar, there is fresh American sturgeon caviar of extremely variable quality and priced slightly lower than sevruga. Thick, jammy pressed caviar, the bottom of the Caspian Sea barrel, is cheaper still, but very intense; it is best eaten smeared on blini with creme fraiche or sour cream.
There are also roes processed from other fish like salmon, with its large, juicy orange eggs; whitefish, which is golden and fine-grained, and lumpfish, which is usually sold pasteurized and dyed black. Caviarteria is selling Carolina trout roe that is a reddish salmon color, fairly small grained, with a subtle flavor at once salty and fruity. And now in Brazil they are even starting to process the roe of some large Amazon fish.
"Good caviar can be awesome," Mr. Sobol said. "But the problem is that half the people who buy it think you should get some kind of a good deal and the other half think you should overpay. The important thing, especially for New Year's Eve, is that caviar should give real pleasure."

HEADLINE: Unfinished Bank Reform

 BODY:
Two years ago, in the aftermath of the $500 billion savings and loan bailout, Congress passed two-thirds of a bank reform. It poured money into a near-empty deposit insurance fund. And it vastly improved procedures by which regulators could close a bank before it tumbled into bankruptcy and required a costly infusion of taxpayer money to pay off insured depositors.
But what the 1991 bill didn't do is correct the cause of many bank failures: antiquated laws that prohibit banks from investing outside their own states and selling new products. 
 The Clinton Administration has now proposed three bank initiatives. One would simplify regulation, collapsing four overlapping agencies into one. That would be prudent, though multiple regulators aren't all bad: rivalry can stimulate innovation. The second initiative would simplify and toughen regulations that require banks to pump loans into low-income neighborhoods. Both proposals are reasonable and likely to do some good; neither is likely to make a big impact.
The third initiative calls for Congress to permit banks to set up branches anywhere in the country, thereby plugging the gap in the 1991 bill. Unfortunately, the Administration gives scant evidence that it's prepared to muscle this valuable and important idea past obstructionist forces in Congress.
Banks are generally restricted to investing primarily in one industry, real estate, and one state. That makes investment in banks risky. When the energy crisis hit in the 1980's, the economy of the Southwest collapsed, dragging the banks down also. One remedy is to permit banks to invest throughout the country -- relying on profits in South Dakota, for instance, to make up for losses in Texas. Another remedy is to allow banks to diversify out of real estate by selling financial products like insurance.
But frenzied lobbyists attacked these sensible ideas when they were proposed by the Bush Administration. Small bankers blocked interstate banking because they feared competition from big banks.
Of course small bankers wrap their opposition in high-minded rhetoric. They argue that small banks would provide more loans to local borrowers than interstate behemoths and that big banks would eventually overwhelm competitors and monopolize local banking. Neither is true. Where wide-scale branching is already permitted, like California, small banks prosper. Also large banks lend as much to local merchants as small local lenders do; small bankers have the same easy access to international outlets for their money. And competition from big banks drives up interest rates on savings accounts of local depositors.
The insurance industry blocked President Bush's proposals to give banks the right to sell insurance. Congress buckled under, even though banks would have served merely as sales agents for policies and would not have incurred risk.
Interstate banking won't get through Congress without a heave from the White House. President Clinton seems disinclined to tackle bank reform when more important measures -- health care, welfare and trade -- loom on the calendar. The political calculation might be faultless. But the nation's banks can thrive just so long on two-thirds of a reform.

HEADLINE: Still Out to Change Japan

 BODY:
After five bruising months in office, Japan's charismatic new Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, has lost some of his initial sparkle. But it is too soon to count him out.
Japanese hopes for more democratic, less corrupt and more consumer-oriented politics still ride on his shoulders. So do America's hopes for easier relations with its most important economic partner and chief Asian ally. 
 Mr. Hosokawa entered office with an ambitious reform agenda. In recent months he has had to come to terms with some formidable obstacles: his coalition Government's thin parliamentary majority, strains between the coalition parties and the strength of Japan's powerful bureaucracy. The new Government has also been constrained by the worst recession to afflict Japan in decades.
Mr. Hosokawa has resorted to some tactical compromises. He has stretched his timetable for key reforms. U.S. officials are already complaining about slow progress on trade issues.
Yet he has already racked up some notable achievements and is still drawing more than 60 percent support in opinion polls -- nearly 10 times the personal popularity enjoyed by some of his Liberal Democratic Party predecessors.
Largely at Washington's behest, he forced his reluctant coalition partners to accept an end to Japan's longstanding ban on rice imports. And, through an adept mix of leadership and compromise, he has come tantalizingly close to enacting his top priority, electoral reform.
Legislation to reapportion districts more fairly and restrict the influence of private campaign contributions has already passed Parliament's lower house. But it awaits an uncertain fate in the upper house. Mr. Hosokawa will try to exploit opposition fears that he will dissolve Parliament and call early elections to try to carry the measure through in the present legislative term. Should he succeed in passing the reforms, he may gain another year without elections, since parties will need time to organize themselves under new rules and in newly drawn districts. By the end of 1994, there may be no going back to the old one-party system.
Instead, various elements of the present governing coalition, which ranges improbably from Socialist left to nationalist right, and from good-government reformers to backroom godfathers, are likely to contend for power.
Mr. Hosokawa's own group represents a more modern political style than any of its main competitors. The Japan it envisions is more democratic, internationalist but not militarist, and ready to put the interest of urban consumers ahead of protectionist producer blocs. This Japan would be an ideal partner for the U.S.
The Hosokawa group is probably not strong enough to prevail on its own. But Mr. Hosokawa has shown in his brief tenure that he knows how to make pragmatic compromises while holding firm to principles. It is an encouraging record, well beyond what anyone, Japanese or American, would have dared predict as recently as a year ago.

HEADLINE: When Currencies Collapse

BYLINE: By Boyden Gray; Boyden Gray, a lawyer, was counsel to President George Bush.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The big trade agreements of the past few months have prompted rejoicing in the United States, Latin America, Western Europe and Asia. But they will be of little value to the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe, where the growing economic disparity with the rest of the world will sow the seeds of enormous regional violence if it is not corrected soon.
The key to the economic plight of these nations is all too easy to overlook: the terrible instability of their currencies and the great difficulty of converting them to other currencies. Yet if the U.S. and the rest of world ignore the currency problems of the old Soviet bloc, we will be repeating the very mistakes that led to World War II -- and forgetting the lessons of the 1940's, which not only corrected these mistakes but also laid the basis for a world trading system and for the collapse of the Soviet empire. 
 What were these mistakes and lessons? Apart from the wrongheaded Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, the major mistake was to pull the financial plug on Germany in the 1920's, leaving it unable to establish sound money and trade with its neighbors. And it was the genius of the Marshall Plan to help re-establish all of Western Europe as an economic trading bloc after the war, so that everyone, winners and losers alike, could rebuild and prosper.
The key to the Marshall Plan's success was not foreign aid itself but the establishment of the European Payments Union, which guaranteed that currencies could be freely converted throughout Western Europe so that countries could attract outside private capital and grow through expanded trade with their neighbors.
But today there is no reliable or predictable currency convertibility and therefore no equivalent opportunity for investment, trade and growth in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, no matter how much foreign aid we pump in. This means economic decline and soaring inflation throughout the region -- conditions that closely resemble Germany's between the wars.
What can be done? As the Marshall Plan showed us, currency convertibility is essential to outside private investment and expanded trade. It requires special attention because there are so many pressures to look the other way. In the short term, the West lacks the incentive to correct the situation: private financial institutions find it too easy to make short-term currency profits out of the chaos. The countries themselves have no short-term incentives, either: clamping down on inflation means denying them the joys of a discretionary fiscal policy -- especially deficit financing (used now primarily to keep the old state-owned enterprises afloat).
Yet without stable currencies throughout Eastern Europe, privatization is certain to be a failure. We in the West take for granted the legal institutions that make privatization possible -- the rule of law, the enforceability of contracts and the independence of the judiciary. These are all legal developments that took a thousand years to mature and are essential to the preservation of property values that are in turn essential to a market economy, if not also to democracy itself. They are largely missing in the former Soviet bloc.
Even without them, Eastern Europe could obtain much of their benefit by looking to their currencies as the basis for a stable, transferable and convertible store of property values. The best way to do this -- and to emulate the best of the Marshall Plan -- is to establish currency boards in every Eastern European country.
A currency board is simply a monetary authority that links the money it issues to a reserve of hard currency, like the U.S. dollar, by means of a fixed exchange rate and 100 percent backing for the notes and coins it issues. (The reserve can be built up in any number of ways, including loans from the International Monetary Fund with natural resources as collateral.) The board earns a profit because its assets (reserves) earn interest and its liabilities (notes and coins) pay none. A currency board system is automatic, like a gold standard. It has no discretionary monetary or fiscal powers, and no power to act as a lender of last resort.
Since the establishment of the first currency board (in Mauritius, in 1849), there have been more than 70 around the world. All have delivered sound money even during civil wars.
The key to their success is their simplicity and foolproof nature. The Marshall Plan's payments union assumed a level of sophistication in currency operations in Western Europe that simply does not exist in the East. So a simpler, more error-proof mechanism is necessary.
John Maynard Keynes established a currency board in northern Russia in 1918, in the middle of World War I and the Russian Revolution. It functioned very well for two years until the Bolsheviks tore it down.
There are, of course, modern examples of currency boards. Hong Kong's is the most famous, and its dollar-backed currency is providing much of the stability behind South China's current economic miracle. Similar growth is happening in Argentina, for similar reasons.
A more pertinent case is Estonia. Like Argentina, it has the substantial equivalent of a currency board; both nations follow closely the advice given by Steve Hanke, the Johns Hopkins University economics professor whose "Monetary Reform in a Free Estonia" and "Central Bank or Currency Board?" were published in Estonian and Spanish, respectively. He has also provided advice on Lithuania, which is seeking I.M.F. and World Bank help to copy the Estonian experience.
What's most urgently needed is for a Western banking consortium to set up currency boards in Ukraine, whose 52 million people are saddled with inflation of almost 100 percent per month, and in other republics of the former Soviet Union. As the recent Russian elections made all too plain, economic instability can lead to political instability. Who would want to promote such a risk in countries that still have nuclear arsenals?

HEADLINE: $89 Million Awarded Family Who Sued H.M.O.

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
In a sign of surging conflict over medical cost containment, a California jury has awarded $89.3 million to the family of a woman whose health maintenance organization refused to pay for a costly, experimental procedure to treat the breast cancer that ultimately killed her.
The award, by far the largest in a case involving the denial of medical benefits, has sent nervous tremors through the health insurance industry, which is struggling to define limits on the coverage of therapies that are experimental or have only a slight chance of success. 
 How and where to draw such lines are central questions as the country seeks to contain soaring health spending amid a rush of technological advances and as more patients join cost-conscious, prepaid health plans like H.M.O.'s, a goal of President Clinton's proposals for revamping the nation's health care system.
Women's health advocates, who say, with support from some cancer specialists, that patients with otherwise dismal prognoses deserve access to a promising treatment, praised the jury award.
The woman, Nelene Fox of Temecula, Calif., who was 40 at her death, had sought coverage for a bone-marrow transplant to combat her advanced breast cancer. It was denied by her health maintenance organization, Health Net, based in Los Angeles.
The judgment was returned in Riverside County Superior Court by a jury that awarded the plaintiffs $77 million in punitive damages on Tuesday and $12.1 million in compensatory damages and $212,000 for medical expenses last week.
In an interview yesterday, the family's lawyer, Mark Hiepler, repeating arguments that had obviously touched a chord among jurors, said the defendant, Health Net, had violated a promise in its contracts to pay for bone-marrow transplants. He also contended that Health Net had financially rewarded its executives for denying coverage of costly procedures and he called this case a warning to any H.M.O. or other insurer that offers such incentives.
Dr. Sam Ho, the medical director of Health Net, which is the state's second-largest health maintenance organization, said the company covered bone-marrow transplants for certain conditions but also had a clear policy of excluding treatments that have not been proved safe and effective. He said that an outside advisory panel of medical experts had agreed that marrow transplants for advanced, metastatic breast cancer, as Mrs. Fox had, were of unproven value. The accusation that Health Net officials had a financial incentive to deny useful treatments was "preposterous," he said.
 
'An Unwarranted Award'
 In a written statement, Health Net said it had acted "in the best interests" of Mrs. Fox, who developed breast cancer in 1991 at the age of 38. The company contended that "the emotional aspects of the case caused the jury to render an unwarranted award" and said it would seek a retrial. Often, huge jury awards are later reduced by courts or in settlements.
James Fox, husband of the deceased patient, said, "I don't think they can hide behind the term 'experimental' and treat people the way they treated us." Mrs. Fox died last April, eight months after receiving the disputed transplant therapy with $212,000 in cash and donated drugs that were raised through public appeals.
"You don't know what the results will be until you try," said Mr. Fox, a junior high school teacher who is caring for their three daughters, ages 5, 10 and 12. "If there's an outside chance of a cure, you want to do it."
Cancer specialists said the costs of the procedure, as reported by Mr. Fox, were at the high end for bone marrow procedures, with charges at some hospitals now as low as $60,000 for some patients. Also, H.M.O.'s often negotiate lower rates than individual patients.
Disputes over payment for the marrow transplants in women with advanced breast cancer have raged for several years. Some insurers have refused to cover what they firmly maintained wa is an experimental method, while others quietly, or under threat of lawsuit, have agreed to pay. But legal experts said they knew of no related cases involving such a huge award. The highest previous jury award for denial of medical services was $18 million, according to records of Jury Verdict Research, a company in Philadelphia.
In interviews with The Los Angeles Times, jurors said Health Net had engaged in "reckless infliction of emotional distress," as one of them put it, and had sought to escape its contractual commitments. The jury foreman, Robley Bowen, said the $77 million in punitive damages had been set after the jury heard details of the company's finances, adding, "They've got their eyes open now."
The $12.1 million in compensatory damages were intended to pay the family for emotional distress and for the company's bad-faith action, said Mr. Hiepler, the lawyer, who is also Mrs. Fox's brother.
The grueling transplant therapy involves weeks of hospitalization and a 5 percent-to-10 percent risk of death from the procedure itself. Doctors remove and save some of a patient's own healthy bone marrow to protect it from huge, devastating doses of chemotherapy administered to the patient in hope of killing off all cancer cells in the body. The marrow is then re-injected to produce new, healthy blood cells.
The method has already proved helpful in certain blood cancers and is being tried in patients with breast and other cancers that have spread beyond the reach of conventional therapy. The Federal government is directing studies on the benefits and risks of marrow transplants in women with advanced breast cancer.
 
Donated Money
 First diagnosed in 1991, Mrs. Fox's breast cancer soon spread elswehere in her body, Mr. Fox said. A local physician and specialists at the University of Southern California said they believed she was a good candidate for a transplant, he said. In June 1992, after Health Net denied coverage, the Foxes launched a public campaign for funds, and she had the procedure in late August 1992. After doing well for several months, her husband said, she declined quickly and died last April.
Dr. David Eddy, a health economist with Duke University who has advised the White House and served as a consultant to insurance companies, said that in a case like this it was crucial to distinguish between issues of contractual obligations and scientific evidence on marrow transplants.
"If the message here is that health care organizations should be more precise in their definitions and procedures, and more consistent in applying them, then over the long run that's fine," he said, although he added that he deplored the size of this award and was not familiar with Health Net's specific actions.
"But if this is interpreted to mean that investigational procedures should be covered," he said, "that is a disaster, not just for the cost of health care but also for the quality of health care." Insurance coverage, he said, is a major barrier preventing wide use of unproved, possibly harmful treatments.
Medical researchers say that at best, a bone-marrow transplant gives a patient with advanced breast cancer, like Mrs. Fox, a small chance of a cure. Whether she would have survived as long as she did by instead relying on conventional therapies is impossible to determine.
Mr. Fox said he did not know if the delay in obtaining his wife's transplant or the strains of campaigning for funds had hastened her death. But he said that once she had the procedure she had a temporary remission and for five months she had "a very high quality of life."
"We had a wonderful Christmas last year," he said.

HEADLINE: Rites of Passage (With Plenty of Boxes)

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
In his dwindling days of power, as his office records and possessions were being packed up, David N. Dinkins set up a clothes rack in the executive wing of City Hall, stocked it with scores of the zippered warm-up jackets he had worn as his trademark costume as Mayor, and had a going-out-of-business souvenir offering for his neighboring loyalists.
Tenderly, he also saw to the wrapping of the kaleidoscopic array of photos of himself with the rich, the famous and the plebian that lined the hidden passageway leading down to the basement inner-sanctum from his office in the northwest corner. The Jimmy Walker-like society pleasures of incumbency for Mr. Dinkins were never clearer to outsiders than in that passageway.
 
Checking Out the Premises
 As if for contrasting symbolism, Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani arrived unannounced last Sunday morning with Peter J. Powers, his deputy mayor-designate and Richelieu-handyman. Lacking celebrity rotogravure, but with the City Hall building blueprint itself in hand, Mr. Giuliani meticulously took stock of the premises he finally won after a five-year, tooth-and-claw campaign. 
"The place was deserted and I was typing notes and letters of recommendation for City Hall people looking for new jobs, and suddenly I hear, 'Hey, Lee,' " said Leland T. Jones, Mr. Dinkins's press secretary. "There they were: the Rudester and the Powerster! Checking office space," said Mr. Jones, who admits to a spirit of bipartisan slap-happiness in the face of all the packing crates and passing power.
This week, the jewel-box setting of City Hall seemed a stage being cleared for a freshly proclaimed hit. A big blue trash bin stood on wheels in the lobby rotunda, filled to the brim with discarded notions and tumbled reports -- notably a full 1993 set, through November, of paperback tomes titled "Reform and Renaissance of the New York City Government." Ominously or not, the bin's contents were marked "recyclable."
"This is a democracy, warts and all," Mr. Jones exulted, confessing to a few tears, as his emotional threshold remains as frayed and narrow as the margin of defeat, but to sudden giggles of liberation, too. His wife, Victoria, is weaning him from all-news, all-adrenaline radio station cycles by finding wispy Kenny G reed music that became popular sometime in the last 10 years and three months of Mr. Jones's spin-doctoring ministrations around City Hall.
"In his first year, Giuliani will have the same problem that Koch and Dinkins had: finding the right character to play," predicted Mr. Jones, who worked for the two previous mayors.
A likely standout among the new City Hall faces may be that of Lincoln, a mongrel dog adopted by Cristyne Lategano, Mr. Giuliani's press secretary. "He was going to be put to sleep," she said, guessing City Hall is a preferable fate. She hopes to bring the black-and-white, mixed breed, "decidedly Fusion" mutt to work with her in the Rudester's press office, as a kind of wet-nosed relief from the press corps, packed together kennel-like down the hall.
Long gone from the building is City Council President Andrew J. Stein, a drop-out early in the mayoral sweepstakes who left politics. "I'm calling from Malibu, from my friend Shirley MacLaine's house," Mr. Stein announced brightly in responding to a query left at his northeast corner office, the most splendid in the building. It is being redone by carpenters for use as a reception room to resonate with the countless "nice-to-see-you's" to come. His old job title is being eliminated under a charter change, but Mr. Stein hardly sounded in a California sulk.
"So much of politics is defensive, worrying about all those groups you have to please," said Mr. Stein, exhausted from 24 years of trying to please more of those groups than his rivals did. "So far I'm not missing any of it."
Still, a visitor to his old office had to note a packing box topped off with a supply of white yarmulkes, de rigueur campaigner's raiment in this city. But Mr. Stein said he was done, evermore, except for some state study commission hearings on juvenile crime. "A favor for the Governor," he said. "We open in New York on the 11th."
In the dying administration, the more dedicated have been treasuring their incumbency the way Walt Whitman once savored his pristine ferry ride to the City Hall shore: "I stood, yet was hurried."
 
'I'm Unemployed'
 Going through her office stuff, Finance Commissioner Carol O'Cleire acain paused even at a long-lost lipstick. "I'm unemployed. I'm going home," she said almost bereftly, "to the Upper West Side."
Deputy Mayor Barbara Fife, an indispensable aide to Mr. Dinkins for a decade, a workaholic to the end, worried about an unfinished agenda stretching from the new city watershed plan upstate to the protection of the African burial ground just outside, by the Tweed Courthouse.
"Issues you put so much into," she said. "It could take six months for the new guys to get back to speed."
Ms. Fife was packing up her office things, including a collection of coffee mugs, and driving some uptown each night while sampling the early nostalgia. "A lot of sadness at first, because it's like breaking up a family," she said. "I will miss the excitement of addressing a problem and working it through, and the collegiality of the talented people here."
What's not to miss at City Hall? "All that take-out food," she said. "And the memos reminding me I failed to answer the previous memo."
The victors are getting their ducks in a row, none more so than former-former Commissioner Henry J. Stern, who is returning to run the Parks Department and was busy retrieving from city storage the dozens of duck decoys and models that previously adorned his office.
"Out-again, in-again is the best political cycle," attested Mr. Stern, who is as effusive as Machiavelli on the intricacies of power. In his out years, he counted four distinct ways that friends were loyal or not, from those who treated him as the once and future commissioner -- "like a Romanoff" -- to those who "tried to chase me out of city organizations."
"I've been imagining going back for some time now," Mr. Stern said not so cryptically.
With City Hall's inaugural bunting up and blowing in the icy East River winds all week, the mood in the downtown municipal warrens includes considerable anxiety. Thousands of patronage appointees have no idea whether they might be retained in or near their specialties, as often happens with transitions through serendipity, patron connivance or merit.
"The holiday is murder," explained one veteran hoping to survive. "The hiring will go on into the spring," he added, speaking of doubt as much as hope.
The Mayor-elect's powers to affect individual morale extends to the 215,000 workers on the city payroll, not to mention the 17,254 inmates and criminal detainees tucked about the city prisons. There is heavy holiday labor but no complaint from Martin Preston, a "facilities management" executive from the General Services Department. He has been seeing to the inauguration stage constructed on the steps of City Hall, as well as to the moves of the two mayors among Gracie Mansion and City Hall and their private offices and residences.
"The movers are part of a contract service, kind of like privatization," explained Mr. Preston, no slouch at picking up on the Mayor-elect's favorite motif.
In the cold and snowy blur just outside City Hall, Mr. Dinkins's voice could still be heard yesterday firmly in control, his image playing endlessly on a kiosk TV screen of visitors' information options as he prepared his own exit through the looking glass. "Just touch the choice that interests you," he boomed, making city governance sound no trickier than virtual reality.

A1); In addition to the swearing-in and speeches at Sunday's inauguration, there will be voices raised in song. But, before the performance, members of the Board of Education's staff and leaders of the all-city high school chorus had to check out the stage -- the portico above the steps of City Hall.

HEADLINE: New Debate on Regional Economics

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
In an era of academic downsizing, small departments are prime targets for university cost cutters. And to administrators at the University of Pennsylvania, the three-decade-old regional science department seems a likely candidate for closing. Only six faculty members and three dozen graduate students are part of the tiny band that studies the economies of cities, states and groups of countries.
The change, said Barbara Beck, a spokeswoman for the university, would be "part of an overall effort to streamline and re-engineer the college." 
 The proposed closing is attracting an unusual flurry of attention within the economics profession, where academics since the birth of modern economics have pretty much ignored anything smaller or larger than a single nation. But as traditional macroeconomic approaches to policy are again found wanting, the study of individual regions -- long a backwater of a profession that worships at the altar of elegant theory -- is attracting more notice.
Regional differences seem more intriguing after a decade in which the Massachusetts miracle was followed by the California catastrophe, and the continents of Africa and South America stagnated while Asia surged.
The paradox is that the Penn department, the flagship in its field, may be closed precisely at a time when regional economics has become a hot topic among mainstream economists.
"All the action in the profession is focused on the regional level," said David Friedman, a consultant in Los Angeles who is analyzing the Southern California economy. "Those with a national perspective really don't have anything new to say."
The interest is not limited to the classroom. Policy makers, including Clinton Administration economists who are fretting over the threat from California's lingering recession to the President's re-election prospects, are suggesting that solving the problems of particular regions may call for more than the simple application of broad-brush macroeconomic policies.
Among the most immediately relevant projects is work by Lawrence H. Katz, an expert on labor markets and chief economist at the Labor Department, and Olivier Blanchard, a macroeconomist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They have been focusing on how long it takes regions that suffer economic shocks to recover, and how they do it.
The classic view has been that a suffering state's economic health ultimately improves because its wages have fallen relative to those in other areas, stimulating demand for workers and capital and attracting jobs back to the state. But Mr. Katz and Professor Blanchard, who looked at the experience of 50 states over the last 45 years, discovered that depressed states recovered mainly because many of their residents piled their belongings on top of the family car and headed for greener pastures.
One implication is that government could speed the healing process by making it easier for workers to move. That might be accomplished by making pension, health and other benefits more portable.
 
A Treasury of Knowledge
 Indeed, despite the flurry of new interest from mainstream economists, there is no danger that the study of how the economy works in a city or a cluster of countries has displaced the search for elegant theorems on general economic behavior. Rather, policy makers and even some professors are finding that the mundane focus on the dynamics of an area and its interplay with other regions can yield a trove of insights.
One result is that many younger economists, who had thought purely in terms of "the economy" and never cared whether growth was happening in Portland, Ore., or Portland, Me., now agree that the key to understanding everything from economic development to international trade is location, location and location.
Mainstream economists have traditionally ignored regional analysis because it is a messy discipline that borrows from a half-dozen other disciplines. Paul Krugman at M.I.T., who talks about international trade as a subfield of "economic geography," points out that the rise of a region's economy typically involves specific business decisions to put down roots as well as other phenomena, "all of which are hard to model formally even now, in the buttoned-down fashion most economists like."
Despite the difficulties, regional economics is attracting some of the brightest young economists.
Besides Mr. Katz and Professor Blanchard, a group led by Professor Krugman is applying trade theory to patterns of industry location.
 
A Study of Western Europe
 Professor Krugman and Anthony Venables at the London School of Economics recently analyzed the potential impact of economic unification on Western European industries. While the French and Germans have feared that heavy industry would migrate to lower-wage countries like Spain and Portugal, the economists found that different countries would likely specialize more than they do now, with each seeing some industries expand and others shrink.
Closer to home, Gordon Hanson at the University of Texas, writing with Professor Krugman, predicted that freer trade in Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement would cause Mexico City, one of the world's most overcrowded cities, to shrink as a manufacturing center. He said factories would start moving toward Mexico's coasts and northern border -- a result that everyone from poverty specialists to environmentalists would welcome.
The recent breakthroughs in regional economics may or may not impress decision makers at the University of Pennsylvania in coming weeks as they weigh the fate of the regional science department, as well as the religious studies and American civilization departments.
While Penn's regional science department has not been setting off many fireworks, its scholars are seen as the keepers of a body of knowledge about specific regions as well as a kit of analytical tools. The department pioneered, among other things, now-classic techniques for analyzing the effects of expanding or cutting military spending.
 
Unique Role
 "The point is there's been no other department like this throughout the world," said Walter Isard, who founded it in the late 1950's when he saw that demand for rigorous regional analysis was mushrooming. He concluded that mainstream departments were getting too theoretical to meet that demand.
Economists outside Penn also argue that a separate department has a unique role to play. Professor Krugman of M.I.T., for example, said the Penn department is a repository of techniques, case studies and data with which most mainstream economists are simply not familiar. Further, he said, mainstream economics departments cannot yet be trusted to hire regional specialists and to train graduate students in the field.
But many others say that whatever its success, regional science should not be a department of its own. Professor Hanson at the University of Texas, who has pursued his research on Mexico within the economics department, argued that academics in regional science could gain from integration into traditional departments.
"The regional science people didn't take advantage of the incredible advances in economic theory in the last 20 years," he said. "The way you get respectability is to become a major field within mainstream economics."

HEADLINE: Dow Creeps Up a Fraction to a New High

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
A late push in the stock market helped the Dow Jones industrial average to edge up to a new closing high yesterday.
The Dow closed at 3,794.33, up 56-hundredths of a point. The gain was even smaller than the fractional gain recorded on Tuesday, yet it brought the index a step closer to 3,800, a psychologically significant level. And while the close marked the third consecutive gain this week, it was off the day's high. At one point, the Dow traded at 3,799.64. 
 Advancing issues outnumbered those that declined, 1,170 to 859, and volume on the New York Stock Exchange, at 269.6 million shares, was greater than the average daily volume for the year. On Tuesday, 203.8 million shares were traded on the Big Board.
 "The market held at this very high level, despite lots of profit-taking by professionals and a rising crescendo of cautionary advisories from the major brokerage firms," Robert H. Stovall, the president of Stovall/ Twenty-First Advisers, said. "The broader market was firm."
The Nasdaq composite index rose 3.92 points, to 768.48, but the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 0.36 point, to 470.58, its first decline in five sessions. The Dow transportation index, which reached a record on Tuesday, dropped 4.29 points, to 1771.32.
Stocks also advanced in Europe, where the London and Paris markets set new closing highs. But the Frankfurt market continued to fall from a high reached on Monday.
Many American investors reacted positively yesterday to a report from the Commerce Department that showed its index of leading indicators rose five-tenths of a percent in November, the fourth consecutive gain. In another report, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes increased 2.9 percent in November, which was better than expected.
With analysts seeing a reviving real estate market and fresh signs of economic growth, hotel stocks were particularly strong. Hilton Hotels rose 1 3/4, to 59 3/8, and Hospitality Franchise Systems gained 2 1/4, to 52 1/2.
Other stocks benefited from recommendations by brokerage firms, including Kennametal, which increased 2 1/4, to 44, and Maxus Energy, which gained 5/8, to 5 5/8.
Sears, Roebuck announced that it planned to open a group of specialty furniture stores, and its shares rose 1 3/4, to 53 5/8.
American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico, whose earnings are expected to be sharply higher in 1994, jumped 1 7/8, to 67.
Two big airline stocks slumped as a result of lowered ratings from brokerage firms, hurting the Dow transportation index. UAL, which owns United Airlines, slid 2 1/8, to 146, and Delta Air Lines fell 1, to 54 5/8. Kmart fell 3/8, to 21 3/8, after it received a lower rating.
General Motors closed at 56, down 3/4, but it also achieved an all-time high in intra-day trading, when adjusted for stock splits, of 57 1/8. The previous high was set in October 1965.
Some closed-end country funds, especially those investing in emerging markets, retreated from recent advances. The Chile Fund was down 2 1/2, to 43 7/8, the Korea Fund was down 3 1/4, to 22 5/8, and the India Growth Fund was down 1 3/4, to 28 1/8.
Advanced Marketing Services, a book distributor, declined 1 1/4, to 4 3/4, after it announced that it expected lower third-quarter earnings. And Emulex, a computer hardware company, fell 3/8, to 5 7/8, after it said that it expected a loss for the second quarter.
The most active stock on the Big Board was the SCE Corporation, the holding company of the Southern California Edison utility, which fell 1/2, to 21. A huge amount of shares, 28.9 million, changed hands as a result of dividend activity.

HEADLINE: Poland Becomes a Major Conduit for Drug Traffic

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, Dec. 29

 BODY:
When four containers of fish from Nigeria arrived at the airport recently, customs officers were suspicious about the unusual cargo. Fish from Nigeria? So they searched, and they discovered, packed with the 120 pounds of carp, half a ton of marijuana worth about $2 million on the street.
A few weeks before, Polish officials on the border with Belarus seized 4.5 tons of hashish that had been secreted in a shipment of fermented raisins from Afghanistan. And earlier this year, the Costa Rican Ambassador to Poland was arrested at the Warsaw airport with nearly 25 pounds of pure heroin in his luggage, with a street value of $900,000, while another drug bust netted 220 pounds of cocaine from South America, with a value of about $7.5 million. 
 These drug seizures reflect a sharp increase in narcotics entering Poland. Some of it is for a growing domestic market, but most of the drugs are en route to Western Europe and even the United States, where Federal law enforcement officials have expressed alarm about heroin being smuggled into the country from Poland. The volume is expected to increase.
 
Trafficking Throughout Region
 And while law enforcement officials in Eastern Europe say Poland has become the biggest transshipment point, drug trafficking has also increased sharply throughout the region, in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, as well as in Russia.
In February, a staggering 1.2 tons of cocaine was seized in St. Petersburg, in a container of canned meat that had been sent by ship from Colombia. Russian officials believe that the cocaine was to be divided into smaller parcels and then smuggled into various Western Europe cities, where the street value would have been in excess of $75 million.
Increasingly, organized criminal elements from Russia and other former Soviet republics, where law and order has almost completely broken down, are operating in Eastern Europe. This new mafia is not only moving into other traditional organized crime fields, like prostitution, but into arms smuggling as well, often financing the purchase of weapons with their enormous drug profits, law enforcement officials say.
"It is an explosion," said Maciej Lubik, a senior Polish customs official and director of the Eastern European office of the Customs Cooperation Council, an international organization, about the growth of the drug traffic in the region.
 
Americans 'Alarmed'
 "The Americans are very, very alarmed," he said, adding that he had been working closely with officials from the United States Customs Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
No one knows for sure the total volume of drugs now moving through Eastern Europe -- the countries have only recently begun keeping records of seizures, and they are spotty at best -- but Mr. Lubik said that at most only 5 percent of the drugs moving through Eastern Europe were being seized.
He estimated that at least 25 percent of the heroin being consumed in Western Europe was now passing through Eastern Europe, and he said that of the 30 tons of hashish seized in all of Europe this year, half had been found in Poland and Bulgaria.
At the moment, most of the drugs passing through Eastern Europe appear to be destined for users in Western Europe, but the United States is alert to the possibility that the drug traffickers will "exploit opportunities in the United States," Stephen Greene, acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, said in a telephone interview from Washington.
Washington is particularly concerned by the activity of the Nigerians in Eastern Europe, he said. "They are some of the most experienced heroin traffickers in the world," he said.
Mr. Green added that his agency had gathered intelligence that organized criminal groups from the former Soviet Union were using confederates in New York and Atlanta to smuggle drugs into the United States.
 
Collapse of Controls
 Drug syndicates are turning to Eastern Europe in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, which has brought an end to rigid border controls, and in the wake of the war in Yugoslavia, which has led to a disruption of traditional drug routes. And the former Communist countries, confronted by a problem they did not face until recently, are woefully unprepared, handicapped by inadequate laws, a lack of experience and paltry resources.
For the drug dealer, once he has contraband in an Eastern Europe country, he finds it easier to move it West. This is because a person landing in New York or Amsterdam or London from Prague or Warsaw is not as likely to arouse suspicion as a person arriving from Bogota, Istanbul or Lagos.
This month, the German authorities seized 638 pounds of heroin entering the country from the Czech Republic in a shipment of Turkish nuts. Worth an estimated $18 million on the street, it was the largest heroin seizure ever in Germany, officials said. It was 200 pounds more than was seized in the record heroin seizure in New York in December.
In October, at the Black Sea port of Constantin, Romanian customs officials seized 9,196 pounds of hashish, worth just over $20 million on the street in Western Europe, packed in tea shipped from Kenya on a Uganda-registered ship. Three days later, they found 13,838 pounds of hashish, worth about $31 million, on another Ugandan freighter, this time secreted among textiles.
 
A Number of Routes
 The illegal narcotics are entering along a number of routes.
From Afghanistan, Pakistan, Thailand and Burma comes heroin, following through Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and the Czech Republic and into Western Europe. Previously, the major heroin route was through Yugoslavia.
Also from the fields of Central Asia come hashish and marijuana, which move by truck through Russia, the Caucusus and Ukraine and into Poland before reaching the ultimate markets. A third route is from Africa, primarily Nigeria, by air and sea.
Even cocaine from Latin America is showing up in Eastern Europe. "The Colombian cartels are beginning to forge links with local traffickers," said Rensselaer W. Lee 3d, an American who has been studying the drug trade for a decade and has turned his attention in recent years to Eastern Europe.
In April the Polish authorities seized 220 pounds of cocaine, with a street value of $7.5 million, in the port city of Szczecin. The ship had come from Latin America, and one of the men arrested with the cocaine had links to the Medellin cartel and had previously smuggled drugs from the Netherlands to England, Polish officials said in recent interviews.
 
Back to United States
 Officials here are beginning to investigate whether some of the cocaine entering Poland from Latin America is being routed to the United States. They also say they believe that the heroin they seized from the Costa Rican Ambassador, Carlos Vargas Solis, was destined for the United States. Mr. Vargas, who is no longer ambassador and has maintained that he is innocent, could not be reached for comment; the Polish police and the Costa Rican Embassy declined to say where he was.
But until now most of the drugs coming into Eastern Europe have been destined for Western Europe.
"There is no immediate threat to the U.S. yet, but I would underscore 'yet,' " Mr. Lee said. "It is only a matter of time."
Eastern European laws make it difficult to keep drugs from entering and leaving the countries. In Poland, for instance, possession of drugs for personal use is not a crime. "It is a progressive law, one of the most humanitarian in the world," said Andrzej Koweszko, a senior officer in the Interpol office in Warsaw. But he added, "It was written by doctors, by sociologists, by everyone but police officers."
 
Little Risk of Capture
 Although smuggling and sale of narcotics are illegal, unless someone is extremely careless, there is little risk of being caught. This is because undercover and sting operations are prohibited by law in Poland, as they are in the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. Nor in these countries is it possible to have a "controlled delivery" -- that is to follow the drug courier to find the person to whom he is delivering the drugs.
These laws are left over from the Communist era, but in that time the police had whatever power they wanted, and drug users and traders were often charged with "crimes against the state" and were severely punished.
In Poland and the Czech Republic, efforts are under way to change these laws, but police officials in these countries said they did not expect their Parliaments to act swiftly.
 
More Resources Needed
 Even with new laws, without vastly more resources, Eastern European governments will have little chance against the drug trade, which is in the hands of organized criminal syndicates. An increasing number of criminal syndicates are run by Russians or others from the former Soviet Union; these groups have long tentacles and ruthless methods of operation.
In many of the countries of Eastern Europe there is a lack of resources and training. Trying to help remedy this problem, the Germans and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration have started conducting classes for law enforcement officials in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in how to detect drugs and arrest smugglers.
"We are complete newcomers, greenhorns," Mr. Lubik, the senior Polish customs officer, said. "It's very easy to cross the border with the knowledge that the customs officer is overworked, that his knowledge about drugs is almost nonexistent, that he has no means of communications. Try to call right now to the border -- sometimes it takes two days."
Drug traders are almost arrogant in their attitude toward the Polish authorities, he said. What else could explain that someone would try to bring a half ton of marijuana into the country packed in fish, he asked.

HEADLINE: J. Wayne Reitz, 84; Headed U. of Florida

BYLINE: New York Times Regional Newspapers

DATELINE: GAINESVILLE, Fla., Dec. 29

 BODY:
J. Wayne Reitz, a former president of the University of Florida, died on Friday at Shands Hospital here. He was 84 and lived in Gainesville.
The cause was respiratory failure after a gall bladder infection, his family said. 
 Dr. Reitz was the fifth president of the university, and the student union building bears his name. For the past 20 years, he worked at the University of Florida Foundation to raise money for the university.
He was born in Olathe, Kan., in 1908 and earned degrees from Colorado State University, the University of Illinois and the University of Wisconsin.
Trained as an agricultural economist, he taught at Colorado State, Illinois and Florida before being named president at Florida in 1955. He resigned in 1967.
He paved the way with the Board of Control, the predecessor of the current Board of Regents, for doctorate programs that formed the nucleus for several research programs, one of which was the precursor of the university's medical school.
He also guided the peaceful racial integration of the university in 1958 after a Federal court order.
Dr. Reitz is survived by his wife, the former Frances Huston Millikan; two daughters, Marjorie Turnbull of Tallahassee, Fla., and Margo Cooke of Huntingdon, Tenn.; two sisters, Nadine Beals of San Diego and Flossie Donovan of Gardner, Kan., and three grandsons.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up Solidly in Europe, Breaking Resistance Levels

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose solidly against the German mark and other European currencies yesterday after a burst of dollar-buying in Europe drove the American currency through key levels.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7274 German marks, up from 1.6990 marks on Tuesday. The British pound, meanwhile, dropped to $1.4775, from $1.5080. 
 The dollar also rose a little against the Japanese yen. In New York, it finished the day at 111.80 yen, up from 111.43 yen on Tuesday.
Gold prices rose in New York after falling overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery, the most active futures contract, gained $3.30, to $391.80 an ounce.
Dealers said the dollar was helped by Government reports showing continued strength in the United States economy. The index of leading economic indicators, the Government's chief forecasting gauge, rose five-tenths of a percent last month, in line with expectations.
Moreover, the National Association of Realtors reported a strong 2.9 percent jump in the sales of previously owned homes.
"There's a lot of reason to be bullish on the dollar," said Dave Glowacki, a senior trader at the National Bank of Detroit. "We are at least moving in the right direction as far as our economy goes."
Another trader, John Duffy of Bank Austria, said traders in London returning from a four-day weekend bought dollars because of strong consumer-confidence figures released on Tuesday.
"The Europeans paid a lot more attention to that number than the Americans did," he said.
There were also rumors of a large speculative buyer in Europe, whose dollar purchases may have been enough to spur the dollar gains in light trading before the New Year.
The buying drove the dollar through significant technical levels, which prompted traders to purchase still more dollars.
"I think today showed a fundamental demand for dollars" in the early part of 1994, said Margaret Kudarauskas, senior foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data, a Boston analysis firm.

In an age of retailing overkill, new products are fewer and more focused on finding customers.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
OUT with the old, in with the new! That cry will be heard often in the next couple of days. Consumer product marketers, though, have been shouting it at shoppers and retailers almost since the moment World War II ended.
New products have helped to fuel the growth of the mighty American consumer economy since 1946, when Tide detergent, "the washday miracle," revolutionized clothing care by supplanting soap flakes. And as recently as this week, Alpo Petfoods announced that it would introduce -- no kidding -- Alpo Beef Chip Cookies, a crunchy dog treat that is baked, shaped and bagged to resemble chocolate chip cookies. (Anthropomorphism has its limits, however; there's no chocolate.) 
 Yet in recent years, shoppers and store managers have cooled considerably to any product bearing the word "New!" inside a starburst. There is no such word as overchoiced, but perhaps there ought to be, for there is a widespread belief among consumers pressed for money and time, as well as among retailers overwhelmed by overcrowded shelves, that products are proliferated beyond necessity, practicality and, perhaps, rationality.
New Product News, in its January issue to be distributed beginning next week, will report that the number of new products in 1993 climbed only modestly for the second consecutive year. Marketers have introduced 17,571 products this year, the publication found, up 4.6 percent from the 16,790 introduced in 1992; that year's increase was just 4 percent from 1991. By contrast, the average annual growth rate in the last decade, according to New Product News, was 14.4 percent.
"Retailers are starting to eliminate what they see as wasteful duplication," said David Olson, vice president and group research director at the Leo Burnett Company who heads the agency's New Products Planning Group. For instance, he noted a decision by Cub Foods Stores, a Midwestern supermarket chain, to "limit the number of products in the cereal aisle."
As a result of such reactions, he added in an interview from Chicago, marketers and their agencies must focus on new products that "have the potential to fundamentally contribute to grow net incremental sales."
"There'll still be a very important role for new products," he continued, "but companies should take a hard look at their new-product activity and redefine what the purpose of that activity is."
Burnett's new products group, which has been involved in 120 new-product test markets in the last 10 years, recommends that marketers concentrate on introductions offering what Mr. Olson called "customer-creating potential."
"The issue of new products that don't create customers for the manufacturer or the retailer is probably the No. 1 area of friction between them," Mr. Olson, a Burnett employee for 21 years, said. "So the concept of creating customers will really resonate with retailers."
The group recommends that retailers "work more with manufacturers to evaluate the potential of new products," he added, "by using individual stores as testing labs and using scanner data to measure the incremental sales of the new products."
In a 30-page report on new products, the group gives examples of those that have successfully demonstrated their customer-creating potential. One is Quaker Chewy Granola Dipps, a chewy, chocolate-covered granola bar that has "expanded the category" and simultaneously enabled Quaker to garner "a large share" of it, the report said. Another is Stainmaster, Du Pont's stain-fighting carpet fiber, which, the report said, consumers "have begun to ask for as if it were a particular brand of carpet."
The report also provides 15 "principles of successful new product marketing," which mix common-sense observations with some unconventional thinking.
"Capitalize on core corporate competencies" is one important principle, urging marketers to base new products on qualities they have already proved they can deliver. Hypothetically, then, the maker of Crunchy Nuggets cereal, beloved by America because it doesn't get soggy in milk, would have the credibility to introduce a similarly sog-fighting brand called Crunchy Flakes.
If the new-product process has become so vexacious, why, then, continue to introduce new brands?
"Over the long haul, new products are incredibly important to us as an agency," Mr. Olson explained. "Fifty-five percent of our current billings are from products we've helped clients launch in the marketplace."
So, happy new products!

Oil Rebounds as Investors Cover Their Short Positions

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Oil prices surged yesterday in a short-covering rally ahead of an anticipated weekly report on domestic inventories and the expiration of some energy contracts at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Crude oil for February delivery jumped 33 cents to $14.44 a barrel after dipping below $14 on Tuesday. Yesterday's move erased most of Monday's 35-cent drop. 
 January heating oil also rose sharply amid forecasts for continued cold weather this week in the Northeast. The January contract gained 1.21 cents to 44.82 cents a gallon. January unleaded gasoline rose 1.04 cents to 39.18 cents a gallon.
 The natural gas for January eased 2.1 cents to $2.054 per 1,000 cubic feet. Traders said there was too much competition from cheap heating oil to let gas prices rise too far.
 Many traders scrambled to rid themselves of short positions ahead of a possible market-moving report from the American Petroleum Institute and today's expiration of January energy contracts.
 After the close, the A.P.I. reported that crude stocks rose 1.6 million barrels, distillate fuel supplies swelled by 813,000 barrels and gasoline stocks fell 592,000 barrels.
 "I think what we're seeing is a short covering rally spurred by the product expiration," said Gerald Samuels of ARB Oil in Los Angeles.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities also soared to a three-year high, spurred by higher oil prices and slightly stronger precious metal prices.
 The index, a closely watched inflation barometer, gained 1.18 points to 226.56 points.
 "The C.R.B. index is on a definitive bull run," said Mark Chandgie of Lafayette Commodities. "After years of depressed prices, several commodity markets appear to have made the necessary supply adjustments to drive higher."
 On other commodity markets, wheat prices rose on talk of fresh export demand.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Russia's political turmoil follows half steps, not shock therapy.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
STARTLING events have a way of focusing the attention of an otherwise distracted body politic. And few events in recent months have been as startling as the rise of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, Russia's 1930's-style bully boy with a 1990's flair for television.
Mr. Zhirinovsky's success at the polls, Vice President Al Gore says, shows that economic reformers have asked excessive sacrifice from the already-humbled Russian masses. Or, as Strobe Talbott, Ambassador at Large to the former Soviet republics and the nominee for Deputy Secretary of State, put it, reform has consisted of "too much shock and too little therapy." 
 That idea plays well in both Washington and Moscow. No wonder: It places the blame on the shoulders of ivory-tower theorists and callous technocrats rather than the people nominally in charge. The trouble is, says Stanley Fischer of M.I.T., who served as chief economist of the World Bank, it doesn't square with the facts. "There just hasn't been much shock," he said.
Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Harvard University economist who advises the radical reformers in President Boris N. Yeltsin's Cabinet, is less diplomatic. The notion that shock therapy has been tried and failed "is preposterous and false," he insists.
 Economic shock therapy has become the treatment of choice for those who believe that rapid change is often less wasteful, less vulnerable to sabotage, and therefore more likely to succeed, than gradual change. The evidence amassed in the shock therapists' favor ranges from the overnight end to hyperinflation in post-World War I Germany to the mass privatization of industry in the Czech Republic over the last year.
Shock therapy came into intellectual vogue in the last days of the Soviet Union, when Mikhail Gorbachev's economists proposed a great lunge toward capitalism, ballasted by weighty sums of Western aid. But a true "grand bargain" -- Western gigabucks in return for a commitment to free up prices, discipline the budget, contain credit and encourage private enterprise -- came only with the rise of Mr. Yeltsin.
The Yeltsin Government eliminated most price regulation and then made a run at bringing down inflation in early 1992 by trimming the subsidies and central bank loans that allowed big industries (particularly those related to the military) to stay in business. But the Communist-dominated Parliament balked, and friends in the Cabinet of the entrenched state enterprises, notably Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin and Viktor V. Gerashchenko, the head of the central bank, undercut the reformers' ambitious plans.
The only changes of enduring consequence, Mr. Fischer notes, were the initial price liberalization and the ambitious start to privatization. But by the same token, very little of the ballyhooed Western aid arrived: Mr. Sachs estimates that less than 20 cents on the dollar of the package promised at this year's economic summit meeting in Tokyo has made it through the bureaucratic sieve.
The fact that neither side delivered does not, in itself, answer the question of the hour: did even a little shock therapy prove too much?
Allowing the prices of staples to rise to free-market levels led to a one-time cut in living standards, Mr. Fischer acknowledges. But the continuing pain for ordinary people, he says, the destruction of private savings and the bewildering scramble for personal security in the teeth of "one of the great income redistributions in history," have largely been results of the failure to stop inflation.
Even those who favor a gradual approach agree that the Clinton Administration has muddled the story: "Shock therapy was only applied for four months," says Padma Desai, an economist at the Harriman Institute of Columbia University.
Most frustrating to the shock therapists is what they see as the nonstrategy behind the White House's response to the Zhirinovsky "wake-up call." Settling for less shock doesn't translate into a policy, Mr. Sachs argues. "You just can't fine-tune hyperinflation," he said.
If some good is to come from the Clinton Administration's belated discovery that a failed Russia may still prove a malevolent force, Mr. Sachs suggests, time is of the essence. At the top of his to-do list is a recommitment to past agreements, with the Yeltsin Government hunkering down on inflation in return for sufficient help from the outside to finance a social safety net for pensioners and the unemployed, convert salvageable military industries and provide the start-up capital for thousands of new businesses.
Mr. Fischer adds that such a deal must be hammered out and overseen at the very top, rather than handed over to the international lending agencies and Kremlin subministries. "Going through the midlevel bureaucrats at International Monetary Fund just won't work," he says.
White House spin control is an understandable, maybe necessary, first response to the elevation of a demagogue who seems to have drawn all the wrong conclusions from the Soviet empire's collapse. But some way, somehow, the West is going to have to lengthen its attention span. To get the job done, the civilizing of the former Soviet Union must remain Priority 1 for the next decade, not just the next month.

HEADLINE: Woman Is Charged With Killing Her Lover After Bailing Him Out

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., Dec. 29

 BODY:
A Medford, N.J., woman has been charged in her lover's slaying shortly after she paid the money for his bail, the police said.
The slain man, William Kelly, 31, of Philadelphia, had been in jail since Dec. 19 on aggravated assault charges, accused of dragging the woman, Margaret Kosmin, 32, by the hair and beating her with a club at a train station in Cherry Hill, N.J. 
 Ms. Kosmin had no choice, said the couple's 15-year-old daughter, Michelle. Her father abused her mother when he became drunk, and had been doing it since the couple were teen-agers, their daughter said.
"My Mom was totally right to do this," Michelle Kosmin was quoted as saying in The Philadelphia Daily News. "If my father hadn't been killed, he would have killed her."
 
Prosecutor Relates Scheme
 Mr. Kelly stayed in jail in Camden until Ms. Kosmin raised enough cash to post his bail, the Camden County Prosecutor, Edward F. Borden Jr., said today. Early Monday a friend of Ms. Kosmin, Tammy Ann Molewicz, 25, also of Medford, posted the $1,000 cash and picked Mr. Kelly up in her red Corvette, Mr. Borden said.
The three drove to Medford, where they stopped at a convenience store to buy food for Mr. Kelly, Mr. Borden said. When Mr. Kelly and Ms. Kosmin returned, the prosecutor said, Ms. Kosmin walked up to the open car window and shot him.
"It was a premeditated, planned and carefully executed murder," Mr. Borden said. "She wanted to get back at him for his beatings and then see that he didn't do it again. She had had enough."
Ms. Kosmin and Ms. Molewicz were arrested on Tuesday and charged with first-degree murder. They are being held on $200,000 cash bail each.
 
Unfair, Women's Group Says
 The body, with two bullet wounds in the head, was found by hunters later on Monday in Wharton State Forest in Waterford Township, face down in a cranberry bog; his head was covered with a pillowcase, the prosecutor said. The body was wrapped in a sheet and twine was tied around the neck, legs and hands. Authorities also found a .32-caliber revolver at the scene, he said.
The murder charge was assailed as inappropriate by Sandy Clark, assistant director of the New Jersey Coalition for Battered Women. Ms. Kosmin may have feared an imminent threat even though Mr. Kelly was in jail, she said.
Michelle Kosmin, their daughter, said her mother had tried to avoid Mr. Kelly for 15 years, fearing violence from her childhood sweetheart.
"We'd move and move, every year practically," the couple's only child recalled. But two months ago they tried to reunite, and Mr. Kelly, who was unemployed, moved into their two-bedroom home in Medford.
 
Police Often at House
 The violence began almost immediately. Neighbors said police cars were frequently sent to the house.
Authorities said Mr. Kelly beat Ms. Kosmin on Nov. 24, breaking her nose. The police arrested Mr. Kelly and Ms. Kosmin immediately obtained a restraining order.
"Her nose was all taped; she was bruised," said a neighbor, Donna Woodhull. "She definitely had been beaten up."
That time Mr. Kelly was released from jail; he returned the same night and was rearrested, authorities said. He was released on bail and less than a week later Ms. Kosmin dropped the domestic violence complaint.
But the couple argued again on Dec. 19 at the train station. Mr. Kelly was arrested and jailed after failing to post $1,000 bail.
 
'Obviously Wasn't Herself'
 When Ms. Kosmin returned to her job as a hairdresser after the attack, "she obviously wasn't herself," said the salon owner, Marco Bonelli. No one knew about the abuse she suffered, he said.
"Her personal life was her personal life," Mr. Bonelli said. "We really didn't know much about her situation."
Ms. Clark of the Coalition for Battered Women said today: "We have dead battered woman after dead battered woman. Sometimes it doesn't matter what she does."
But Mr. Borden said Mr. Kelly had not posed a danger to Ms. Kosmin.
"The bail set was adequate to keep him in jail for a period of time and keep him away from her," Mr. Borden said. "She was being protected by the system."

HEADLINE: Talk of Shifting Arts Money Is Met With Anger

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
Plans by the Giuliani administration to increase financial support for New York City's premier arts institutions, possibly at the expense of less renowned ones, was met with anger and trepidation yesterday by members of the arts community and politicians who have wrestled with apportioning ever-shrinking arts dollars.
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan called such plans "misguided and unfortunate." Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and the chairman of the Council Finance Committee, Herbert E. Berman, Democrat of Brooklyn, said they would protect money for cultural institutions against any "ill-informed and insensitive actions by the new administration." 
 Mr. Vallone said Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani's new cabinet members "have a lot to learn" about making public their policy proposals before they have been fully developed.
Arts groups throughout the city said some of them might not survive if their subsidy from the city's Department of Cultural Affairs is cut.
"If you cut D.C.A. funding for Thalia Spanish Theater and other program groups like us, you will kill us, plain and simple," said Kathryn Giaimo, administrative director for the dance group in Queens.
The reactions followed comments Tuesday by John S. Dyson, Mr. Giuliani's deputy mayor for economic development and finance, that some arts institutions in the city might be receiving municipal money because of "clubhouse-type politics." He said the new administration would review support levels for the 431 groups now sharing $87.3 million in municipal assistance, to see how the city could funnel more of the money to the highest-quality institutions, like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which he said contributed more to the city's economic development by attracting tourists to the city.
He said no decisions had been made about the level of financing for any group, especially as Mr. Giuliani has yet to name a new Cultural Affairs Commissioner.
But his comments were interpreted as elitist by the directors of some small arts groups, who said it was strange, coming from an administration that had campaigned on improving the quality of neighborhood life.
Concerned about the tone of outrage at his statements, Mr. Dyson called Mr. Vallone himself to discuss the administration's policies on money for the arts. He said that in the end they agreed to work together to increase financing for the arts, and to discuss cuts to any particular program before they are made.
The size or the fame of each institution, he said, would not be the main guideline in determining its merit.
"For them to only honor the elitist institutions, it just doesn't make sense," said Sylvia Herskowitz, director of the Yeshiva University Museum in Washington Heights. "Everyone is going to give money to the big museums. It's the small ones that need this money. There isn't a big museum in Washington Heights. Does that mean that Washington Heights will just be left to wither away?"
 
Value of Diversity
 The statements also prompted Ms. Messinger to call a news conference with several smaller arts groups to condemn any plans to favor the pre-eminent institutions at the expense of more obscure ones.
"The arts industry in the City of New York is strong precisely because it is diverse," she said. "Just as it is smart economic development policy to pay attention to small businesses as well as large ones, precisely the same thing is true of the arts. You have to pay attention to poetry reading groups and small dance performance studios in Brooklyn."
Others said that despite Mr. Dyson's assurances that he would not favor Manhattan, his emphasis on institutions that are a tourist draw would end up penalizing the other boroughs.
"I want to point out in my 17 or 18 years as Borough President the problems we had," Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn said. "One incoming commissioner who paid a visit to my office had the audacity to ask, 'Why do we need the Brooklyn Museum? We have museums in Manhattan.' I found that to be so aggravating, I can't describe it. I tried to explain and will to Dyson also, there is no such thing as the best cultural institution. They are all great. They are all necessary."
 
A Divisive Move
 Mr. Vallone and Mr. Berman said Mr. Dyson was trying to pit arts groups against one another.
"The Council has worked very hard over the last four years to encourage all the city's cultural groups to lobby as one voice," they said.
Mr. Dyson said yesterday: "The No. 1 focus is economic: how do we get New Yorkers employed? The focus is what do each of these institutions that are getting money do. We will look at each institution through the lens of economic development and ask ourselves what does this particular program do to increase the number of jobs in the city of New York."
Mr. Vallone said later that Mr. Giuliani could have avoided the uproar in the arts community if the new policy had been better thought out.
"I just think they have a lot to learn," Mr. Vallone said. "I'm trying not to be too critical, but we've gone through these mistakes before."
"You've got to be very careful with what you say," he said. "The last thing we need now is for the cultural institutions to think we're going to abandon them."

HEADLINE: The Carpet Man Fulfills a Promise;
With Guns-for-Toys Program, Fernando Mateo Succeeds at Last

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
The toys-for-gun man, so deluged by claims on his time, was hardly able to ponder wall-to-walls or cut-piles, though it was his success in floor coverings that made his goodness possible.
"I'm going crazy, but it's a good kind of crazy," he said, settled behind his carpet store desk, which was strewn with phone messages. The phone and his beeper trilled simultaneously. He scooped up the phone. 
 "Hi, yeah, it's Fernando," he said to a toy executive. "I'm tired. This is for a good cause and I'm going to continue. But, I tell you, I better start selling some carpet or the banks are going to call my mortgages."
Fernando Mateo, the 35-year-old carpet man, said he had no idea that his notion last week to trade toy store certificates for guns in perilous Washington Heights would achieve such wondrous success that people throughout the world would start dialing him up. "I haven't eaten in three days," he said the other afternoon, insisting on breaking for some Chinese food. "I get home at night and have stomach cramps. I've even gotten calls from London, Australia, France. They want to know how to start programs."
He gulped some rice. The Larry King show called. Some shrimp. The mother of a slain police officer. Broccoli. The Chase Manhattan Bank.
"I need help for the program," he implored the bank. "If you guys can give me $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, I'll get you all the media you want."
Mr. Mateo is short, lithe, kinetic. He has an obdurate belief in himself and a ravening appetite for work. His carpet business, though, has endured plenty of tumult. The rush of publicity, he said, has made many people think he is some millionaire carpet king. He only wishes. In fact, the $5,000 he contributed to inaugurate the toys-for-gun program was charged, he said, on his MasterCard. "And I was already pretty close to my limit," he said.
 
Wall-to-Wall Trouble
 His own life, he said, has been mostly devoid of guns and violence -- he was fairly straight arrow as a teen-ager, though he bought a gun himself when he turned 21 -- but it was always a teasing struggle.
Like many of the residents of Washington Heights, he is Dominican. He was born in Santo Domingo. His father, a struggling owner of taxi cabs, had some 25 children out of wedlock and another 10 with Mr. Mateo's mother, he said. When Mr. Mateo was two-and-a-half, the family gravitated to New York and established a home on the Lower East Side. His father dabbled at this and that -- he owned a bodega, had a linoleum business, imported fruits and vegetables -- and money was tight.
After attending parochial schools, Mr. Mateo entered Seward Park High School. "I was scared," he said. "I was a hick. I dressed wrong. I wasn't hip, and I was laughed at." To gain acceptance with classmates, he experimented with drugs. To break free of this cycle, he dropped out. His father didn't speak to him for three months. "I was supposed to be the doctor or lawyer in the family," he said. "I was the one who was supposed to make the family the proudest."
He was 15 and he wanted to lay floors. He trained with two brothers who had their own linoleum businesses, then switched to a more seasoned carpet company. "One day we were cutting white carpet and I stepped on the carpet and the owner went berserk and chewed me out in front of everyone," he said. "I quit. I got a job at another carpet company and got married, and when I returned from my honeymoon the owner said he couldn't afford me. I decided then that I would never work for anyone else again."
With a $2,000 loan from his father, he rented a storefront on Avenue A, and Carpet Fashions was born. It was 1976, the Bicentennial year, and he decorated the window with a big American flag made out of carpet.
 
Pleading for Solvency
 Business was tepid at first, he said. He transported carpet roped to the roof of a crumpled 1969 Chevrolet, and one accident resulted in the car's trunk being shoved into the back seat.
His first big job was at a six-story tenement -- to carpet all the stairways -- a $2,000 order. The customer wouldn't pay him, and Carpet Fashions almost folded, he said. Mr. Mateo called on a carpet distributor and sank to his knees. "I begged him for a credit line," he said. "He told me to get off the floor. He said, 'Kid, you're going to make it. I'm going to give you a $1,000 credit line.' "
He learned, and business came. He opened a showroom on Fourth Avenue and 12th Street. He was basically breaking even, but he envisioned becoming the largest carpet retailer in New York and then a chain with outlets in every major city.
That was when he got sidetracked. There is a Dominican tradition known as "la promesa," in which, in return for an answered prayer, a person makes a sacrifice: not wear shoes for a week, skip lipstick for a year. In 1977, Mr. Mateo had prayed for health and success, and if it came he promised to give back to the community.
 
Trouble in Midtown
 In 1989, he felt it was time to deliver. He and his second wife, Stella, had moved to a nice house in Westchester. It was virtually bare, but he told Stella that furniture must wait, he said. It was "la promesa" time.
He contributed $2,000 and countless hours to start a program on Rikers Island to teach nonviolent first offenders to become carpet layers, plumbers, electricians. This became the Mateo Institute of Training.
"I was spending two, three days a week at Rikers and I neglected the business," he said. The recession blew in. Another unanticipated blow struck: the publicity about the Rikers program soured clients, he said, with some telling him they wouldn't buy carpet from him and have convicts come to their homes to put it down.
In 1990, by which time Mr. Mateo had opened a glassy showroom on East 54th Street across from Citicorp Center, Carpet Fashions had lost $17,000 and sank more than $500,000 into debt, he said. Even his accountant thought he was going bust.
To help out, his wife returned to work running a real-estate office in the Bronx. And Mr. Mateo shifted his emphasis from residential customers to big commercial work. He courted construction contractors and jobs came. Mr. Mateo said that Carpet Fashions hung on in 1991 and 1992, and has turned a decent profit this year on sales of about $6 million. He said he laid all the carpet at Madison Square Garden for the Democratic Convention and installed 60,000 yards of carpet for the new headquarters of Price Waterhouse.
"Freddy's always had that dream to make it," said Sgt. Richard Pacheco, an officer in the 19th Precinct who grew up on the Lower East Side with Mr. Mateo. "When he dropped out of school, I thought he was going to be sucked up like everyone else, but he always had this determination and this positive outlook. And he's always been one of these give-the-shirt-off-my-back type of guys."
Of late, Mr. Mateo said that he makes a solid middle-class income, but has no savings account and two mortgages on his home.
He says it annoys him that few have stepped forward to create jobs for the graduates of his Rikers program. After four years, only 18 have emerged from the program. If support doesn't come, he said he may have to abandon it.
 
An Idea Becomes Reality
 The gun idea originated while Mr. Mateo was watching the Giants-Saints game with his son, 14-year-old Fernando Jr. (he also has two young daughters). At half time, they switched to the news and heard about four people being shot in Washington Heights. His son, repulsed by violence, said he would forgo Christmas presents if he could get just one gun off the streets. That, he said, planted a seed, which became the offer of a $100 gift certificate at Toys 'R Us for any gun that came into the 34th Precinct.
Mr. Mateo makes it clear that he does not wish to disarm all of America. He said the gun he bought when he was 21 was only to protect himself, though he said he never fired it. He would not say whether he has a gun now, yet he thinks it is fine for businessmen and politicians to own guns. But he wants assault weapons and Uzis off the streets and guns out of the hands of the irresponsible.
By now, more than 400 guns have been turned in at the 34th Precinct, with contributions from other companies paying for additional certificates. Mr. Mateo believes at least 60 percent of those who relinquished guns are gang members or drug dealers. A 12-year-old brought in a gun, and so did an elderly man in a wheelchair. People showed up from New Jersey and from Connecticut with their arsenals.
Now the program has been extended at least until Jan. 6, when many Dominicans observe Christmas. Moreover, Mr. Mateo intends to organize a national committee to help other cities start programs. He plans to survey people in Washington Heights to see what they want for their guns. He has gleaned that they prefer starter jackets, expensive sneakers, and airplane tickets.
Ideas spin out of his head. "I would like Mercedes-Benz to give me a vehicle a month so we can raffle it off," he said. "Anyone who turns in a gun will not only get a certificate but a raffle number. We'll talk to G.M., Toyota, all the car companies. I think they'll respond. A weapon off the street is good for everyone. Because you're a chief executive doesn't mean you're bulletproof or your child is bulletproof."
So far, he said, no one has come into Carpet Fashions, inspected the 10,000 samples and said that they so admire his idea that they are going to buy his carpets. "I could use the business," he said. "If I got it, I could do more. But I hope people just view me as being grateful to all New Yorkers who gave me a business opportunity."

HEADLINE: Haiti: Ready to Explode?

 BODY:
There is no justifying the vicious mob attack that killed two civilian supporters of Haiti's military regime Monday and provoked a retaliatory rampage against slum dwellers presumed to support the exiled President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
But it is not hard to understand why frustrated Aristide supporters may now be turning to violence. Since the September 1991 military coup, most have put their faith in international diplomacy or sought to flee Haiti altogether. 
 But with diplomacy consistently thwarted by military obstructionists, anti-Aristide gangs swaggering triumphantly and a U.S. Coast Guard flotilla blocking all refugee ships, the patience of the poor and desperate may be about to run out.
Let the Clinton Administration heed the warning. Washington, in its efforts to win the Haitian military's consent to a workable compromise, has leaned hard on President Aristide to accept repeated concessions and delays. That is understandable. Short of sending in the marines -- a very bad idea -- give-and-take negotiations are necessary.
But all give by the Aristide side and all take by the military has not produced a solution. What it may produce instead is disastrous social combustion. To lessen that risk, Washington needs to tighten the pressure of sanctions and loosen the safety valve of refugee flight.
That means following through on a French proposal to broaden the U.N. oil embargo to other items if there is no diplomatic breakthrough before the Jan. 15 deadline. And it means listening to the conscientious misgivings of Administration officials and modifying the present policy of turning back all boats carrying fleeing Haitians without listening to claims to legitimate political asylum.
One reason the Pentagon has always been reluctant to send U.S. troops to Haiti is that it fears Americans could get caught in the middle of mob violence. Specifically, it worries that Aristide supporters, emboldened by an international presence, would seek revenge on paramilitary death squads and that the paramilitaries would fight back. Monday's bloodbath demonstrates how realistic those anxieties are.
Washington cannot produce magical solutions to Haiti's crisis. What it can usefully do is crank up the embargo against the generals and crank down the blockade against fleeing refugees. Desperate Haitians need to know they are not forgotten.

 BODY:
Welcome to the 20th annual Office Pool. Because this participatory prognostication has answered the unfelt need of millions, this tradition has been imitated in all media.
I have always tried to score lower than my readers, and last year went especially deep into the tank: all but one wrong. (That one, however, forewarned that Clinton would jack up the highest effective tax bracket over 40 percent. Richies could have saved millions acting on this tip.) 
 As experienced pool-players know, the point is in the range of intriguing options offered. My advice: Never play percentage pool; always play your hunch.
1. The highest pitch of tension within the Clinton Administration will be between (a) guru James Carville and the Florida gubernatorial hopeful Janet Reno; (b) Hillary Clinton and Al Gore, laying the basis for Democratic primaries in the year 2000; (c) Strobe Talbott and Bobby Ray Inman over Russia policy; (d) the Clinton adviser Bruce Lindsey and the Criminal Division's chief, Jo Ann Harris.

Mario Cuomo edged by unknown Roy Goodman; (d) Chuck Robb survives Doug Wilder primary challenge and beats Oliver North.
5. Talk of the magazine world will be (a) the success of youthful cyberspace-salesmen in selling "Wired"; (b) the stigmatization of young singlehood in Rupert Murdoch's "Married Woman"; (c) editor Angela Harrington's successful launch of Time's youth-oriented "Mouth 2 Mouth."
6. Of nonfiction best sellers, the one stirring the greatest outrage will be (a) "The Betrayed Profession," by Sol Linowitz and Martin Mayer; (b) "The Deep Divide," by Sherrye Henry; (c) "The Man in the Water," by Roger Rosenblatt; (d) "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness," by Peggy Noonan; (e) "Taking Charge," by Irene Pollin; (f) "Leaving Home," by Art Buchwald.

12. Stunning changes will include (a) Mickey Kantor to Secretary of State, Christopher to chief of staff, McLarty to Budget; (b) Mario Cuomo to replace William Rehnquist as Chief Justice; (c) C.I.A. chief James Woolsey to rescue Pentagon from big-spender, don't-call-me-Bobby Inman; (d) Zhou Rongji slips past favorite Jiang Zemin to run China after Deng's death; (e) CBS's Larry Tisch, stripped of N.F.L. ball, tackles Disney.

HEADLINE: Why Blame California For Rice Subsidies?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Contrary to "Look at What Rice for Japan Will Cost Us" (letter, Dec. 19) by Prof. Thomas Koelble, California rice grows principally in northern California with a small amount in central California, and none in southern California. No water from the Colorado River is diverted to central or northern California. Furthermore, diversion of Colorado River water, while not used for rice growing, is neither an economic disaster nor environmentally destructive. 
 Yes, there are subsidies to rice growers in California (as well as Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Japan, Korea and Thailand, to name a few), but the California growers are not "among the most heavily subsidized agricultural producer groups ever."
The original goal of the United States in the Uruguay Round was to eliminate all agricultural subsidies, at least among Organization for Economic Cooperation Development countries. That failed because major trading partners, including the European Community, would not agree.
While the Uruguay Round did not bring about as much trade liberalization as the United States (and others) originally desired, it is a great step forward.

HEADLINE: SALES IN NOVEMBER OF EXISTING HOMES HIT A RECORD PACE

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29

 BODY:
Spurred by growing confidence in the economy and a fear that low interest rates may not last, Americans snapped up single-family homes in November at the fastest pace ever recorded, the National Association of Realtors announced today.
Sales of existing homes in November ran at an annual rate of 4.21 million homes. That rate, which is statistically adjusted for seasonal variations, was 2.9 percent higher than in October and 9.1 percent ahead of the November 1992 pace. 
 The previous record, set in November 1978, was an annualized rate of 4.15 million home sales.
This higher-than-expected activity reinforced optimism that the economy would continue to expand at a brisk pace in the new year, a prospect also reflected in a separate set of figures issued today showing a five-tenths of 1 percent rise in the Government's main forecasting index.
 
 
'Interesting Numbers'
 The composite index of leading indicators has now climbed four straight months after managing only one gain in the first seven months of the year. Composed of items that tend to move ahead of the economy at large, like orders for manufactured goods, the Commerce Department index is designed to peer six months or more into the future.
"These are interesting numbers, especially the home sales," Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Bank in Pittsburgh, said. Forget about a possible early 1994 slump from tax increases, weak exports and military cutbacks, he advised, adding, "All's clear on the recession watch."
The strength of the broad, current economy was confirmed by the Commerce Department's index of coincident indicators, which also posted a gain of five-tenths of 1 percent last month -- its fourth consecutive advance.
But since most of the index's components had been previously published, the bulk of the attention today went to the housing report. While sales of existing homes do not have the economic impact of building new ones, they do mean strong sales of items like drapes, paint and appliances, as well as business for lenders, lawyers, real estate agents, appraisers, moving companies and various kinds of insurers. The Government will issue its report Thursday on November sales of new homes.
November marked the seventh sales advance in the latest eight months and the highest since the real estate group began keeping records in 1968.
All regions of the country except the West contributed to the new sales record, which was a result not only of 20-year lows in interest rates but of an improved job market, rising consumer confidence, gains in income and relative stability in the price of houses.
"Month by month, I think the public has gotten more confident," said P. Wesley Foster Jr., president and owner of Long & Foster Realtors, which is based in Fairfax, Va., and is the nation's third-largest real estate concern. "When interest rates bottomed out and started kicking up, people really got busy," Mr. Foster said.
The national average commitment rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was 7.16 percent in November, down from 8.31 percent a year earlier but somewhat above late-summer lows.
Mr. Foster said that after the first quarter, when his company's sales were 10 to 12 percent below those a year earlier, the company had posted quarterly gains of 18 to 25 percent for the rest of the year. He said he expected strong sales to continue.
 
 
Median Price of Homes
 The median price of homes sold last month was $106,800, up $200 from the October level but below the $109,300 in June that was the highest so far this year.
Month to month fluctuations, however, are heavily affected by what kinds of buyers are active and do not necessarily indicate the overall direction of prices. Still, the recent price data tend to confirm a belief that the sales surge is concentrated among first-time buyers moving from apartments.
For his company, Mr. Foster said, first-time home buyers accounted for about 48 percent of recent sales compared with the traditional proportion of about one-third.
By region, the Midwest posted a November sales gain of 7.3 percent, to an annual rate of 1.17 million. It was followed by the Northeast, up 4.9 percent to 640,000, and the South, up 4.1 percent to 1.53 million. The decline in the West was 4.3 percent, to a rate of 880,000, the report showed.
 These numbers include a factor for typical seasonal variations, such as higher sales volume during the summer that reflect favorable weather and a desire by many families to minimize their children's school disruption. But analysts caution that these adjustments can sometimes distort results, particularly those that are then annualized by assuming that a monthly pace continues for a full year.
Nevertheless, the association's criterion that it takes several months to establish a trend has now clearly been met.
Actual sales last month, with no adjustment, were 140,000 in the South, 75,000 in the Midwest, 65,000 in the West and 43,000 in the Northeast.
The Commerce Department's forecasting index was impressive not only in its string of four straight increases but in its sustained breadth. Eight of the 11 components contributed to the November advance, paced by lower first-time claims for unemployment benefits, higher orders for new plants and equipment and a rise in the price of materials especially sensitive to the business cycle.
 
 
Other Gains
 Other elements helping to push up the index were a rise in building permits, higher backlogs for manufactured durable goods, an expanded work week, a higher money supply and manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials.
Negative forces were lower consumer expectations, which were reversed in December; faster deliveries to companies by their suppliers, and stock prices as gauged by the Standard & Poor's 500 index.
The department's companion index of lagging indicators that move only after a turn in the economy eased two-tenths of 1 percent last month, the fourth consecutive month without a rise.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 1, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page chart on Thursday, with an article about a surge in housing sales, mislabeled the 1993 figure for sales of existing single-family homes. It represented the annualized rate of home sales for the month of November, not for the year through November.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Progress On Nuclear Talks With North Korea

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30

 BODY:
North Korean diplomats have told the United States that international monitors can have access to their seven officially disclosed nuclear sites, Clinton Administration officials said today.
But the North Koreans have not approached the International Atomic Energy Agency to work out the procedures for the inspections, nor have they offered to allow inspectors to visit two undeclared nuclear waste sites that have been off limits to the agency. As a result, Administration officials say it is too soon to determine if the two sides have achieved a breakthrough in the talks, as the official North Korean news agency asserted today. 
 Still, Washington and Pyongyang have made progress toward opening up the seven sites to inspection, senior Administration officials said today.
"As a result of the most recent talks," the State Department said, the United States has "moved closer" to meeting its objectives.
The issue of North Korea's nuclear program has become the Administration's most perplexing foreign policy problem and has raised fears of renewed conflict on the Korean Peninsula.
The issue has divided specialists. Some State Department officials say they believe that North Korea is prepared to give up its nuclear program in return for economic and political concessions. Analysts from the Central Intelligence Agency tend to view North Korea as a defiant regime that is intent on proceeding with its nuclear program and is just playing for time.
The Administration is working for a diplomatic settlement, but has held out the threat of economic sanctions in case the diplomacy fails. South Korea and Japan strongly support the diplomatic approach, reflecting anxiety about a political, and possible military, confrontation on the Korean Peninsula.
To defuse the North Korean threat, the Administration has adopted a phased approach.
During the first phase, the United States wants the North Koreans to agree to inspections of their seven sites and agree to exchange envoys with South Korea. In return, Washington would suspend the military exercise the United States carries out every spring to practice the reinforcement of South Korea's defenses.
While the North Koreans have indicated that international monitors can have access to the seven sites, Administration officials say the test of Pyongyang's intentions will come if it works out satisfactory arrangements with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The North Koreans have previously allowed inspectors to visit some of the sites, but have sometimes made it difficult for them to conduct their work.
"Right now, interpreting the North Korean statements is sort of like trying to decide how many angels can dance on the head of a pin," said a State Department official. "The test will be what they do with the I.A.E.A."
Even if the inspections are resumed, they will not resolve some critical questions. The inspections would constrain North Korea from producing more plutonium for nuclear bombs, but they would not resolve the issue of whether North Korea has produced enough plutonium for a nuclear bomb or has already made a nuclear bomb.
The Central Intelligence Agency and most other American intelligence agencies have told the White House that there is a better-than-even chance that North Korea has already developed one or more bombs. But State Department intelligence experts dispute that assessment, as do Chinese diplomats.
The question of whether North Korea has already diverted enough plutonium for a bomb is to be taken up during a second phase of talks, in which the United States would try to persuade the North Koreans to give international monitors access to two nuclear waste sites in return for expanded economic and political ties. The two sites have been off limits to the International Atomic Energy Agency and are not among the seven sites officially disclosed. The waste sites could provide evidence of how much weapons-grade nuclear material the North Koreans have produced.
Talk of a breakthrough was stimulated today by a dispatch from North Korea's official press agency, which quoted a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman.
"Through the latest contact, the sides removed a series of stumbling blocks," the spokesman said. He added that the two sides have achieved "a breakthrough for the progress of the talks by displaying the spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation."
Senior Administration officials said the statement might be a sign that North Korea intends to contact the International Atomic Energy Agency in the near future.
A State Department spokesman said he expected further meetings between the two sides aimed at hammering out an agreement. Because the Clinton Administration is maintaining the posture that it is not conducting high-level talks with North Korea, the American delegation in New York is headed by Tom Hubbard, a mid-level State Department official.

HEADLINE: Rita Klimova, 62, Czech Dissident Who Became Ambassador to U.S.

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
Rita Klimova, a former dissident who served as Czechoslovakia's first Ambassador to the United States after the ouster of the Communist Government, died yesterday in a hospital in Prague. She was 62.
Her death was reported by The Associated Press, which quoted C.T.K., the official news agency of the Czech Republic. She had recently undergone treatment for leukemia. 
 Mrs. Klimova was diagnosed as having the disease shortly after she was named Ambassador to Washington in February 1990. She stepped down from the post in August 1992, less than four months before her country split into two nations, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
After her retirement from the Czech diplomatic service last year, she lectured on Czech affairs at several universities, including the New School in Manhattan.
 
Schooling in New York
 Mrs. Klimova was born in Europe but spent part of her youth in Manhattan, where her family fled in 1939 after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. Her father, Batya Bat, was a journalist and writer who used the pen name Stanislav Budin.
She attended grade school and junior high school in New York. In 1946, her family returned to Czechoslovakia, where she attended high school and college.
Mrs. Klimova became a member of the Communist Party in 1948. She worked as a translator and taught political economics at Charles University in Prague.
She was dismissed from her university post after Soviet-led troops of the Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush the liberal reforms of Alexander Dubcek.
She devoted her efforts to defending human rights and the political opposition, and she was expelled from the party in 1970. In 1989 Mrs. Klimova became the spokeswoman for the peaceful revolution that toppled the Communist Government and elevated her fellow dissident, the playwright Vaclav Havel, to the presidency.
 
Voice of the Revolution
 When the Communist regime began to disintegrate in November of 1989, she nearly missed the big moment.
She had been in Hungary meeting with two Czechoslovak exiles, and she drove home on the night of Nov. 19. There she found a message from Mr. Havel saying he wanted to meet with her the next morning.
Arriving at his apartment, she found him facing television cameras and photographers. Mr. Havel had called a news conference to mobilize the anti-Communist opposition, and he wanted to be sure Mrs. Klimova would be there to convey his message in American English.
She sat down next to him and began interpreting. For the next several weeks, as the old order crumbled, hers was the English-language voice of the "Velvet Revolution," an expression that she coined.
She is survived by a son, Vladimir Mlynar, and a daughter, Michaela Barlova, both of Prague.

HEADLINE: Florida Seeks U.S. Aid For Illegal Immigrants

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 30

 BODY:
Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida has ordered his state to sue the Federal Government to try to reduce the flow of illegal immigrants and recoup the money Florida is forced to spend on social services for them.
"The people of Florida should not be compelled to subsidize the entry of illegal aliens into the United States, nor should they tolerate continued failure of the United States Government to carry out its duty under the law," Mr. Chiles wrote in a letter to the State Attorney General, Bob Butterworth, this week. 
 Mr. Chiles' office estimated that Florida spent at least $739 million in 1992 to provide health care, education, housing and other social services to immigrants and political refugees. In his letter, the Governor said Florida should get full reimbursement for the services and care it gives illegal aliens.
"If the United States Government chooses to selectively enforce the law, it has a corresponding obligation to incur the costs," the Governor wrote.
Mr. Chiles' action is the latest in a heated discussion about the nation's ability to absorb new arrivals from abroad. In August, Gov. Pete Wilson of California, the state that received more immigrants than any other during the 1980's, urged Congress to require identity cards for legal immigrants. He also called for a constitutional amendment to deny citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants.
 
Other States Complain, Too
 Officials in Texas and Illinois have also complained that Washington has not helped them bear the rising cost of social services for immigrants. And both New York and California have in recent years sued the Federal Government as they sought relief from part of that burden. In both instances courts dismissed the complaints.
But Florida's Deputy Attorney General, Pete Antonacci, said today that he thought the new suit stood a better chance of success partly because the factual issues were slightly different and partly because more judges were becoming sympathetic to the difficult position of states. "As the situation worsens, the courts are going to take a realistic approach in dealing with this problem," he said.
As an example, Mr. Antonacci cited the Supreme Court's decision in a challenge to the 1990 Census. He said he found the case comforting because "the underlying theory is that the judiciary should give the executive a wide berth except when entitlement programs are involved or there are consequences to cities and states that are financial and not political."
He noted that the challenge was ultimately rejected but that "there are four votes that are still there" in favor of Florida's position.
Asked if Mr. Chiles intended to pursue the suit all the way to the Supreme Court, Mr. Antonacci replied, "We'll go wherever we need to go to get people to hear us."
Immigration is now at its highest point since the early years of this century. Experts have estimated that more than 1.2 million people a year, mostly Latin Americans and Asians, have entered the United States legally or illegally in recent years.
More than three-quarters of all legal immigrants are concentrated in six states: California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas. When illegal immigrants are added in, that proportion rises to about 90 percent, demographers say.
 
Politics in Florida
 Mr. Chiles, a Democrat who was elected in 1990 on a populist platform and said he would run for a second term next year, has in the past been sympathetic to the aspirations of newly arrived immigrants. He is likely to face a stiff Republican challenge in 1994, and the position he has taken in ordering the lawsuit is one that has already proved popular in Florida.
At the same time, Mr. Chiles is trying not to alienate the state's powerful Cuban constituency or other voters of Latin American or Caribbean descent. He sought to draw a distinction in his letter between political refugees who are fleeing oppression and illegal immigrants who are looking for economic opportunities. "There is no intent to cast any aspersion on people seeking freedom in this country," the Governor's communications director, Ron Sachs, said today.
Nevertheless, in his letter, Mr. Chiles complained of the way in which Washington handles political-asylum claims. He was especially critical of the common practice of allowing refugees to stay while their cases are being heard.
Mr. Chiles was not available today to comment about his action. But Mr. Sachs said the Governor had acted after years of frustration with Federal immigration policies. Mr. Chiles was a United States Senator at the time of the Mariel influx from Cuba in 1980.
Mr. Chiles "has exhausted the appropriate diplomatic channels of letters, visits and phone calls" in trying to persuade the Federal Government to reimburse the state for the costs of immigration, Mr. Sachs said.
 
Diplomacy Fails
 Among those efforts was a letter Mr. Chiles and the Governors of New York, Texas, California and Illinois sent to President Clinton in January, calling for the new President to "restore a partnership with the states" in paying for the costs of immigration.
"If the Federal Government wishes to sustain a humanitarian foreign policy which fosters immigration and refugee admissions, then it must allocate the financial resources required to support this population once it has arrived," the five Governors wrote.
Since 1980, Florida absorbed three large, unexpected waves of immigrants that were direct results of American foreign policy, and Mr. Chiles has repeatedly complained that the Federal Government has provided virtually no help. The 125,000 Cubans who came to the state in the Mariel boat lift were followed later in the decade by an estimated 100,000 Nicaraguans in the late 1980's and an equal number of Haitians in recent surges. The Haitians, unlike the Cubans and Nicaraguans, are not classified as political refugees.
People from all three countries are still coming and have tended to cluster around Miami, giving the local economy a burst of energy and investment but adding to demands for social services. One-quarter of the pupils in the Dade County school system were born outside the United States, and the county's largest hospital estimates the cost of treating undocumented immigrants at $300 million over the last three years.
"When do we reach the saturation point?" Florida's coordinator of immigrant and refugee affairs, Nancy Wittenberg, asked in a telephone interview today. "It gets more and more difficult to respond, and transportation and jobs and everything else become a problem. You have to stop somewhere and examine the whole scenario, and that's what we are trying to do."

Joint Venture To Merge Plastics Units

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: MILAN, Italy, Dec. 30

 BODY:
The Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Italy's Montedison S.p.A. said today that they would merge large parts of their plastics businesses, creating a company with annual sales of nearly $3 billion.
The new company, to be equally owned by the parents and based in the Netherlands, will be the world's largest producer of polypropylene, a plastic widely used for car parts, and will have 18 percent of the world market. 
 Montedison, the debt-laden chemicals group controlled by Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A., will contribute about two-thirds of the assets, including Himont Inc. of Wilmington, Del., with sales of about $2 billion. Shell is bringing assets with sales of more than $1 billion.
Montedison will receive no cash from the transaction, but will transfer about $2 billion of its $10 billion debt, thus reducing its financing charges once the agreement is final early next year.
Lorenzo Colucci, an analyst at Natwest Securities Ltd. in London, called the deal a plus for Montedison and a great one for Shell. "They are creating the world's largest polypropylene group, merging with a U.S.-based unit they can easily run and supervise, and are buying a well-known name just when the recession appears to be ending," he said.
Montedison's Himont is the world's largest producer of polypropylene, with 12 percent of the market, while Shell is No. 2 with 6 percent. Polypropylene is a rapidly growing market but is suffering from overcapacity.
 
Merging Polyethylene Units
 The two companies will also merge their polyethylene activities, putting the new venture among the top 10 producers of the plastic. Polyethylene is the most widely used plastic, found in most packaging and toys.
Montedison's sale of Himont to the venture may be the first of several the chemical holding company undertakes as part of a plan to cut its debt, analysts said. Himont was Montedison's largest operating unit and potentially its most profitable, they added.
Analysts also said similar mergers could be made elsewhere in Europe. The British Petroleum Company P.L.C. and Italy's Enichem S.p.A. are seen as possible partners.
Montedison, which is also selling another polypropylene maker, Moplefan S.p.A., to the venture, still controls the energy group Edison S.p.A. and the chemicals group Montecatini.
Montedison reported a 1993 first-half operating profit of $460 million on a 26 percent increase in sales, but because of financing costs it had a $420 million net loss. Shell's chemicals division lost $249 million in the third quarter.
Ferruzzi's total debt at the end of June was about $17 billion, run up in the 1980's during an acquisition spree just before the worldwide recession made debt financing prohibitive.
Shell said the new enterprise would include all of Montedison's and most of Shell's polyethylene and polypropylene activities. Not included are Shell's joint ventures in Japan, Germany and Singapore and the Shell Oil Company's polyolefins activities in the United States. Polyolefins include polypropylene and polyethylene.

HEADLINE: Conservative Thinkers Are Insiders;
It's Now Their City Hall, and Manhattan Institute Is Uneasy

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
With Rudolph W. Giuliani about to become Mayor, the conservative Manhattan Institute should be riding high. The iconoclastic research group has seen some of its favorite ideas -- selling city hospitals to private groups, cutting local business taxes, curbing the excesses of multicultural education -- adopted as pillars of Mr. Giuliani's campaign.
The group's stalwarts are on first-name terms with the new City Hall team. One trustee, Peter M. Flanigan, managing director at Dillon, Read & Company, had lunch this week with Donna Hanover Giuliani, the Mayor-elect's wife. Ninfa Segarra, the new Deputy Mayor for health, social services and education, has praised its work on giving parents more choice of the public schools their children attend. And Richard J. Schwartz, senior adviser to Mr. Giuliani, calls the institute an "integral part of the movement for a new urban agenda for the 1990's." 
 Yet for all its ties, the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, as it is formally known, is finding it hard to switch from outside critic to inside participant. No one thinks it is harder than William Hammett, the institute's president since 1980.
"For most New Yorkers, politics is about little more than jobs; what we care about are ideas," Mr. Hammett said in the earnest manner that friends consider his most endearing trait. Surrounded by books and papers by authors he has sponsored, Mr. Hammett was in his office at the institute's headquarters at 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, near Grand Central Station.
"The commitment of New Yorkers to ideas does not, to say the least, run very deep," he said. "What New York is about is amassing money, acquiring influence and power. Whose law firm is up and whose is down. Which developer is in, which is out. That's how this city runs. But when the new people come in, without fresh ideas they'll be dead."
 
Idea Merchants vs. Power Politics
 The clash between idea merchants and power politics is already evident.
Stephen Kagann, an outspoken advocate of lower taxes and a prominent contributor to City Journal, the institute's quarterly magazine, was the Giuliani campaign's research director. Pushed out after the election, Mr. Kagann gave an angry parting blast in a Newsday interview last week. The Mayor-elect's top advisers, he charged, were "all political operatives and former prosecutors" with "no managerial talent."
"I'm not meant to be an insider," Mr. Kagann says. "You'd have to say I've burned my bridges in a most spectacular blaze. I guess I'm just more comfortable playing the role of critic."
Others at the institute already express disappointment with several Giuliani appointments. They complain that the new Mayor is much too sanguine about the pain required to tame the fiscal crisis. And like Mr. Kagann, they doubt Mr. Giuliani's team has the skill or fortitude to carry out a far-reaching overhaul of city government.
The nonprofit Manhattan Institute, with a budget of $5 million and a staff of about 30 people, would seem wildly out of place in liberal New York. Its attacks on what it calls the welfare state, which New York City embodies in so many ways, branded the institute as an outpost of the anti-urban Reaganism that swept Washington in the 1980's. The institute's founding in 1978 by William Casey, Mr. Reagan's C.I.A. director, didn't help.
Indeed, the institute emerged from obscurity by sponsoring two books that helped define the conservative counter-revolution: George Gilder's "Wealth and Poverty," a 1980 paean to tax cuts and freewheeling capitalism, and Charles Murray's "Losing Ground," a tough-minded 1984 attack on social welfare programs (both published by Basic Books).
In recent years, however, the Manhattan Institute has turned its attention closer to home. Its three-year-old City Journal, now edited by Peter Salins, has built a following in government, academia, the media and business with its detailed analyses of the failures of local government.
 
Ringmaster and Fund-Raiser
 Mr. Hammett, once an investment banker, serves as the institute's ringmaster and fund-raiser. Among its luminaries are Dr. Salins, an urban affairs professor at Hunter College who advocates an end to rent control; Seymour Fliegel, once a deputy school superintendent in Manhattan's District Four and author of "Miracle in East Harlem: The Fight for Choice in Public Education" (Times Books, 1993), and Linda Chavez, who headed the United States Civil Rights Commission and now runs the institute's Center for the New American Community, based in Washington.
Driving the institute's thinking is the conviction that New York's government can no longer ignore the economic changes that have transformed the globe. "In this world economy, you can't hide anymore," Mr. Hammett said. "Even socialist governments are changing -- but New York is still trying to be the last centrally planned political system."
That belief is common among conservatives. What distinguishes the Manhattan Institute is its work to translate its ideology into concrete proposals that appeal to a wide spectrum of political beliefs.
"They've become a kind of Alcoholics Anonymous for many liberals," said Sol Stern, executive director of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Commission on Juvenile Justice Reform. "We can go there and confess that we, too, think something is fundamentally wrong with the way the city works."
Institute ideas once considered heretical, like cracking down on homeless drug addicts who gather in public places, are now urged even by such liberals as Pete Hamill, the writer.
 
Less Theory, More Garbage
 "I respect them as responsible conservatives," said Andrew Hacker, a professor at Queens College who wrote a scathing indictment of racism in American society, "Two Nations: Black & White, Separate, Hostile, Unequal" (Scribner's, 1992). "I'd rate them well above the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation and others of that ilk in Washington. They are not concerned so much with grand theory as with the best way of collecting garbage."
To be sure, the Manhattan Institute is not lacking in critics.
Peter Marcuse, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University, said he "welcomes their focus on urban issues, but most of their remedies are wrongheaded."
"The consensus among professionals in the field is that the prosperity of the city cannot be left simply to private initiative," Dr. Marcuse said.
They have also been accused of extraordinary narrowness. Last year the institute co-sponsored a forum on "Rethinking New York" at which all 12 speakers were white men. "Never even thought of it, to tell you the truth," Mr. Hammett said.
 
Not the Most Sensitive Soul
 Ms. Chavez, an advocate of assimilation for Hispanic people and other minorities, strongly defends Mr. Hammett, though she says he may not be the most sensitive soul. "All institutions have their own networks, but it's not just white males," she said. "I'm not interested in being a token anything, and at the Manhattan Institute, I don't think I am."
The move from a libertarian emphasis on individual freedom to a focus on the nuts and bolts of local issues has cost the institute some early supporters, like the Adolph Coors Foundation. "We don't have far-right funding," Mr. Hammett said. "They hate New York and would be just as happy to see it go to hell."
Still, it has such conservative backers as the Sarah Scaife, Smith Richardson and John M. Olin Foundations. It is also aided by the more liberal J. M. Kaplan Fund and the Commonwealth Fund. Corporate sponsors include Chase Manhattan Bank, State Farm Insurance and Citicorp.
In the late 1980's, nearly all the local seers expected New York to weather the nation's economic slump better than most places. Manhattan Institute experts were among the few who rightly predicted the worst.
"We were almost the only people who took the decline of the city seriously," said Fred Siegel, a Cooper Union professor who recently stepped down as editor of City Journal. "That gave added force to our argument that there was something profoundly dysfunctional about the political culture of New York."
Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University and an unpaid adviser to Mayor David N. Dinkins, praises the institute for taking on such neglected issues as fostering small business, overhauling urban transport and having city services done privately.
"The Manhattan Institute has superseded the traditional foundations based in New York -- the 20th Century Fund, the Ford Foundation, Rockefeller, Carnegie -- as a source of new ideas for the city," he said. "The others have gone off into another world."
But Dr. Moss also sees a hard road ahead: How does the institute, which "thrived as a critic of the liberal welfare state," stay vital "now that it has friends in high office?"
 
The Leverage of Ideas
 Mr. Hammett replies that the institute will stick to what it does best. "The real leverage is on the side of ideas," he said. "The best way to insure that the 'outs' keep them in mind once they're 'in' is to keep the ideas flowing."
Ms. Chavez said the group's thinkers probably should avoid political office. "Success for us doesn't necessarily mean you take the people who generate the ideas and put them in public positions," she said.
Despite its focus on New York, the Manhattan Institute has had its greatest influence in other cities. Mayors in Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Jersey City and Phoenix have praised it and adopted some of its advice.
If the institute is no longer the intellectual bomb thrower it once was, it hopes at least to throw off enough new sparks to catch the practical politicians' attention. The obstacles remain immense.
"There is not going to be any quantum leap under Giuliani because everybody realizes how hard it is to get anything done in New York," said an institute senior fellow, Edward N. Costikyan, a seasoned Democrat and a senior partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, who served on the Giuliani transition council. "It is very easy to write an article saying what should be done. But nobody has written the article on how you do it."

HEADLINE: New Home Sales Jump By 11.3%

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Sales of newly built single-family homes shot up 11.3 percent in November to their highest level since 1986, the Commerce Department reported yesterday -- providing new evidence that families are hurrying to move out of rented apartments and into their own homes before they are priced out of the housing market again.
"People are starting to believe that the declines in home prices that had plagued the market for months have stopped and prices might move up again, along with mortgage rates, so they are taking advantage of this window of opportunity," said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Consumer Research Center. 
 At an annual rate, buyers signed contracts to purchase 807,000 single-family dwellings -- some of them already completed and some still being built or not yet even started. That represented a rise of 11.3 percent from the October level of 725,000 dwellings. The report was the second in two days to underscore a boom in home sales that first surfaced in late summer.
 
 
Most Gains in the West
 Most of the November increase in new-home sales came in the West, including California, where the economy has been especially weak. The strong Western showing might reflect a reviving California housing market, or might be a fluke, economists said. Sales in the Northeast fell in November from October's level.
President Clinton hailed the boom in home sales as evidence that "the American people are taking control of their economic destiny," according to a spokesman, Jeff Elder. Mr. Elder quoted the president as having said, "This shows the result of low interest rates, low inflation, bringing the deficit down and increasing investment. People are getting more optimistic about the future."
With Government spending cut way back to reduce the budget deficit, the Clinton Administration has relied on low interest rates to stimulate the economy. The policy has paid off in rising car sales, the booming market in single-family homes and rising appliance sales -- all items usually purchased on credit. Largely as a result, the American economy has grown much more strongly in the fourth quarter than in the first nine month's of 1993.
Reflecting this strength, initial weekly unemployment claims fell by 39,000, to 291,000 last week, the lowest level since February 1989, the Labor Department reported yesterday.
The housing boom has also pushed up sales of previously owned homes. They reached a record annual rate of 4.2 million units in November, the National Association of Realtors reported on Wednesday. As for new-home sales, they were higher in November than at any time since March 1986, when sales reached 880,000 at an annual rate.
The Commerce Department yesterday also revised upward the October figure in yesterday's announcement, increasing that month's sales to 725,000 from a previously reported 679,000, at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate.
 
'They Rushed In'
 Such figures in recent months have convinced many economists that the boom is a result of an unusual, and perhaps fleeting, set of circumstances, one that cannot be explained only by low mortgage rates. Many families had postponed home purchases, waiting not only for mortgage rates to fall below 7.5 or even 7 percent, but for home prices to stop the fall that began in 1987, after the stock market crash. This summer both goals were reached, and the boom developed in both sales and construction of single-family homes.
 "My hypothesis is that people held off in the spring and summer, waiting for mortgage rates and home prices to hit bottom, and once they saw the bottom, they rushed in to buy," said Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association, offering a widely held view. "I would caution that while we may be able to hold the current sales levels, we may not see substantial additional increases in 1994."
The median price of new homes sold in November rose to $130,000 from $129,400 in October and $126,000 in August. Mortgage rates, in turn, have risen to 7.2 percent for 30-year, fixed rate mortgages, from 6.6 percent in the summer.
The sharp rise in new-home sales last month reflects a Commerce Department calculation that home sales are normally strong in the spring and summer and weak in the fall, particularly November. To allow for this weakness in determining the annual rate, the actual number of home sales is adjusted upward. The actual sales figure in November was 56,000 units, roughly equal to the 57,000 units sold in October and also in September, the Commerce Department said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Slip in Thin Trading; Dow Off 18.45

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Pressured by a weak bond market and profit taking after setting new records in previous sessions, the stock market declined yesterday on light trading volume.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,775.88, down 18.45 points, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index closed at 468.64, down 1.94. But the Nasdaq composite index of secondary stocks rose 2.60 points, to 771.08. 
 "The stock market did well," considering the moves in interest rates, said Hugh A. Johnson, senior vice president of the First Albany Corporation. "A little bit closer look at the market indicates that it wasn't as bad as the decline in the Dow suggests."
 
Bond Yields Up
 Long-term interest rates rose sharply on thin trading in bonds, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond increasing to 6.34 percent from 6.24 percent Wednesday.
Bond prices fell after two Government reports suggested that the economy might be stronger than expected. One report showed the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits last week fell to nearly a five-year low. Another report showed new single-family home sales rising 11.3 percent in November, to the highest level since April 1986.
The number of declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange narrowly exceeded advances, 1,093 to 991. Volume was 193.7 million shares, well below the 269.6 million traded on Wednesday.
"The one message that comes out of the market this week is that it is clearly struggling," Mr. Johnson said. "It's been two steps forward and 1.9 steps backward."
With gold prices higher, many gold stocks advanced yesterday. Battle Mountain was up 1/8, to 10 3/8; Homestake Mining was up 1/8, to 22, and Newmont Gold was up 1/8, to 46 3/4.
Some closed-end country funds moved higher, as investors continued to give attention to companies in emerging countries. The Chile Fund gained 5/8, to 44 1/2, and the Korea Fund increased 7/8, to 23 1/2.
 
A Gain for MCI
 MCI Communications rose 1 1/2, to 27, after reports that it would announce plans to reduce the amount it pays local telephone companies to complete long-distance calls. Arrow International, a medical supplies company, was up 1 1/2, to 22 1/2; it said its fiscal first-quarter profit topped analysts' forecasts.
Among other gainers, Sci-Med Life Systems jumped 2, to 39 1/2, after its rating was raised by Dain Bosworth. And USF&G climbed 1 1/4, to 15 1/8, apparently in reaction to being named one of the top stock selections by Kidder Peabody.
Utility stocks fell, reflecting concern over higher interest rates. The Dow Jones utilities average eased 0.72 point, to 230.36.
In addition, IMC Fertilizer, whose rating was lowered by J. P. Morgan, dropped 1 5/8, to 44 5/8. Supermac Technology, which will take a fourth-quarter write-off for job reductions and a plant closing, declined 1 3/4, to 10 1/4.
And Lady Luck Gaming, which was served a complaint on Wednesday by Mississippi gaming officials accusing it of moving and operating casino equipment without authorization, fell 1 1/4, to 9 1/2.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Drop Sharply

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Reports of more strong economic trends on a day of very slow trading combined to push prices of Treasury securities down sharply yesterday, sending interest rates higher.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond dropped 19/32 , to 9826/32 , or about $12.81 for each $1,000 of face value, while the yield jumped to 6.34 percent, from 6.24 percent Wednesday. 
 Charles E. Roden, managing director and head of fixed income at Josepthal, Lyon & Ross, said the market appeared to be awakening to the fact that business is getting better.
"Interest rates do not just go up because of inflation fears," he said. "They also go up as the demand for money increases. As business continues to get better banks will start lending money."
With the economy getting stronger, investors who had been buying longer maturities to get higher yields are now repositioning, buying shorter maturities and selling some long-term issues. But the slowness of the market yesterday, with many traders preparing for the New Year holiday, meant that a sizable sell order could move the market.
Initially, it was the unexpected plunge in weekly jobless claims that helped to weaken Treasuries. The number of people filing for jobless benefits declined by 39,000, to 291,000, last week. But analysts attributed the decline to the holiday-shortned week, leaving one less day for applications.
 
Surge in November Home Sales
 A short time later, the Commerce Department reported that new home sales surged in November, which brought a further slump in Treasury prices. As a result, sellers took control of yesterday's thinly traded market.
The 11.3 percent gain in November new home sales was much stronger than expected. But MMS analysts said the breakdown of the data suggested that the gains were uneven. Much of the increase was in the West, where sales are 34 percent higher. Gains in the South and Midwest were slight, while the Northeast had a decline. Some traders also said that the strong housing sector had already been discounted in credit market prices.
Also released yesterday was the Chicago Purchasing Managers' index, which was close to expectations, backing off slightly to 62.6 percent in December after November's strong 65.3 percent.
With no data for release today, and with half-day sessions scheduled for both the futures and cash markets, the market is expected to close 1993 on a quiet note.
With most of the November economic numbers known, the main worry will be whether the strength of the fourth quarter will spill over into the first quarter of next year, some analysts said.
The December employment report is scheduled for release on Tuesday, with inflation data due out later in the month, which should begin to provide indications of the economy's end-of-the-year direction.
The Treasury announced yesterday that it plans to sell $16 billion in 52-week bills next Thursday, unchanged from its previous auction requirement.
Short-term Treasury securities were mixed, with the three-month bill rate off 1 basis point to 2.98 percent and a six-month rate up 2 basis points to 3.20 percent. The outstanding one-year bill was up 1 basis point to 3.44 percent. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.

HEADLINE: Gratitude for Deliverance With Gifts to the Neediest

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
In late 1939, Ernest and Auguste Mohr received the most important letter of their lives.
In the envelope sent to their home in Bavaria was an affidavit of support signed by Julius Ochs Adler, a vice president and general manager of The New York Times and a friend of the Mohrs' distant relatives in the United States. 
 The piece of paper literally saved the couple's lives, helping them get a coveted visa to flee Hitler's Germany even as Mr. Mohr was being held in a concentration camp.
"At that time, people could leave only if they had someone here to testify that they had family in the United States," Mrs. Mohr, who lives in Kew Gardens, Queens, said recently. "Mr. Adler said that if need be, he would take care of us. Without him, we would have never gotten out."
 
Continuing a Tradition
 Now, 54 years later, Mrs. Mohr is continuing a tradition that her late husband began several years ago, to honor Mr. Adler and to commemorate his act of kindness by contributing to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which is conducting its 82d annual appeal for donations.
Mrs. Mohr's gift of $50 is one of many that have been sent this year in memory of loved ones who died in the Holocaust or as a small token of gratitude from people who escaped or survived its atrocities.
As in the past, The Times pays the administrative costs of the campaign so that all contributions are sent directly to seven social-service agencies to help the city's homeless, hungry and disabled.
The agencies face growing responsibilities. In addition to people with illness, addiction or family problems, the charities also have to help scores of people who are facing unemployment and homelessness for the first time because of the weak economy.
 
For Each Year in U.S.
 Eric W. Zielenziger of Great Neck, L.I., and his wife, Ruth, recently sent in a check for $47. "I am a Holocaust survivor," Mr. Zielenziger wrote. "I have been in the U.S. for 47 years and they have all been good years! One dollar for each year!"
Other donors, like Hannah Herz and her brother Werner, sent in a contribution to carry on a tradition their parents, Alfred and Hedwig, began decades ago to celebrate their family's escape from the Nazis.
The Herz family arrived in the United States on Dec. 20, 1937. "As soon as they could afford it," Mr. and Miss Herz wrote, "our parents celebrated the anniversary of this date with a donation to the fund, in gratitude for the safety and good life we found here."
With the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington this year and the release of "Schindler's List," a film by Steven Spielberg about the Holocaust, many people with no direct connection to the events during World War II have been moved to action.
Marcia Robinson of Manhattan contributed $50 to the fund, as she has done for the last two years. But her reason this time was different.
"This year, because of the recent release of the movie "Schindler's List," I have decided to make my contribution in memory of the Simon family (although I cannot tell you the correct Polish name and spelling of it) who perished in the Holocaust," Ms. Robinson wrote.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on Good News For the American Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved higher on world currency markets yesterday, bolstered by better-than-expected data on the American economy.
Gold prices, meanwhile, rose sharply in Europe on speculative buying but ended only marginally higher in the United States. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery settled at $391.90 an ounce, up 10 cents. 
 Two favorable Government reports supported the dollar in light, holiday-week trading. The Commerce Department said sales of new homes shot up 11.3 percent in November to the highest rate in more than seven years, while the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits plunged 39,000 last week to the lowest level in nearly five years.
 
 
Office Closings Cited
 Analysts cautioned that some of the drop might be attributed to the closing of Government offices the day before Christmas, which left fewer days to file claims.
Still, the reports were enough to send the dollar through resistance levels against the German mark and the Japanese yen in active dealings. Though the dollar settled below these highs, it was still up on the day.
In New York, the dollar stood at 1.7353 marks, up from 1.7274 marks on Wednesday. It also ended at 111.81 yen, up from 111.80 yen.
The economic reports "just convinced people that maybe they shouldn't be so worried about the U.S. economy slumping over in the first quarter" of the new year, Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group, said.
Even though investors want to see more data for December, "good numbers keep rolling in better than expected," Mr. Donney said, and that's convincing people that the recovery is sustainable.
A strengthening economy would give the Federal Reserve greater latitude to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates help to bolster the dollar because they increase the yield on dollar-denominated securities.
A certain bullishness about the dollar is building. "A lot of funds are trying to position themselves for an anticipated rally in the dollar in the first quarter," said Michael Malpede, an analyst with Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago, and that means buying dollars.

Noble Efforts
Everyone knows it has been a tough few months in the commercial theater, particularly on Broadway. "Wonderful Tennessee," "The Kentucky Cycle" and "The Red Shoes," among too many others, closed prematurely, and the specter of a nearly unmitigated flood of musical revivals looms. The Broadway Alliance, the consortium of producers, craft unions and theater owners dedicated to bringing in low-cost dramas, teetered on the brink of extinction after two productions -- "Mixed Emotions" and "Any Given Day" -- foundered, and a third, Sam Shepard's "Simpatico," was abandoned. 
 But there are plaudits to be awarded as well, and not just to Tony Kushner's "Angels in America: Perestroika," which has already gathered plenty, or "My Fair Lady," which, by box office standards at least, is the surprise hit of the season.
Before the year is history and their efforts with it, let's acknowledge these people:
*David G. Richenthal, the novice producer of "The Kentucky Cycle," who, in a mammoth effort against all odds and much advice, did the deed; he brought in a worthy show that New Yorkers had never had a chance to see, and kept it running probably longer than was good for him.
*Margaret Illmann, the Canadian ballerina who starred in "The Red Shoes"; Lar Lubovitch, the show's choreographer, and Heidi Landesman, the designer, whose set is now sitting in a dump in Torrington, Conn. All their work would surely have been remembered with Tony nominations had the show run long enough to qualify for them.
*Roger Berlind, the producer of "Paper Moon," whose decision to postpone the $4.5 million show indefinitely after its out-of-town tryout was a prodigious act of bullet-biting. He returned all the money to his investors, and in the process avoided a public disaster on Broadway.
*Jonathan Tolins, the 27-year-old playwright whose play "Twilight of the Golds," about a young couple who learn their unborn child will be homosexual, never found an audience in New York. Mr. Tolins is a promising young writer with a provocative subject; even those who didn't like the play, and there were many, would agree that in better days, there would be a place for it on Broadway. Indeed, if contemporary audiences have such a short memory that they turned their back on the proven playwrights Brian Friel and Frank Gilroy this fall, it's an equally sorry signal that they didn't give the kid a break.
 
<SC0>Sweet Successes
 Things were generally better elsewhere. The commercial Off Broadway houses have just about finished a cycle, as two successful holdovers from last season, "Jeffrey" and "Oleanna," are about to close: so is "Later Life," which transferred from a nonprofit venue, Playwrights Horizons, where it opened last spring; and so, more sadly, is "Forbidden Broadway," which, after threatening to close earlier in the month, will now do so for sure on Sunday, ending an 11-year tradition.
Here are some other end-of-the-year nods:
*Claudia Shear, whose one-woman show, "Blown Sideways Through Life," an acerbic tour of the author's unemployment history, had enough of an impact that in October Ms. Shear was chosen by ABC News -- national! -- as "Person of the Week." Having begun life at the New York Theater Workshop, the show now gets a commercial run, opening at the Cherry Lane Theater on Jan. 7.
*Andre Bishop and Bernard Gersten, respectively the artistic director and executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, whose productions this fall illustrate a coherent and well-realized game plan. "The Lights," Howard Korder's nightmare vision of New York, initiated a Festival of New American Plays; the revival of Robert Sherwood's "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" began a series of resurrections of works from a forgotten period of American playwriting. With Spalding Gray's monologue, "Gray's Anatomy," and the upcoming revival of "Carousel," they describe a satisfying panorama of American theater works.
*Lynn Meadow and Barry Grove, respectively the artistic director and managing director of the Manhattan Theater Club. Their offbeat productions, John Patrick Shanley's "Four Dogs and a Bone" and "The Loman Family Picnic" by Donald Margulies, shared a funny, acid spirit. And they were both successful at the box office, too.
 
A Legal Matter
 After failing to resolve among themselves issues involving pay-per-view television, the producers of the upcoming revival of "Damn Yankees" and Actors Equity, the performers union, took the dispute to arbitration. The main question was about participation in the pay-per-view performance as a condition of an actor's employment.
On Wednesday, the arbitrator, Walter Gellhorn, a Columbia University law professor, ruled in favor of the producers, Workin' Man Films and Polygram Diversified Entertainment, meaning that in order to appear in the Broadway production of the show, which opens at the Marquis Theater on March 3, an actor must agree to appear in a pay-per-view performance as well, should the producers decide to have one.
 
Happy New Year, She Said
 The year's last word comes from Lynn Redgrave, whose one-woman show, "Shakespeare for My Father," a personal tribute to both men in the title, was one of the year's surprises. Produced by her husband, John Clark, it opened at the Helen Hayes Theater in April with plans for a modest six-week engagement; when it closes on Sunday it will have played 272 performances.
"It's been an extraordinary year," Ms. Redgrave said, about her own experiences and those of her theatrical neighbors. "We've seen how hard it's been for everybody, if we needed any more reminding of how lucky we've been with this one."
Given that the show is such a Redgrave family event, it's surprising that neither Ms. Redgrave's mother nor her sister saw it until November.
"There was some reticence early on," she said. "I wondered how they would find it. They saw things in it they didn't know, and as it turned out, hadn't thought of." Knowing they were in the audience, Ms. Redgrave said, "was very nerve-wracking for the first five minutes; then I heard my sister laugh, and I settled down."
Asked if she had any parting words, Ms. Redgrave was gracious and grateful.
"I thank the gods of theater," she said. "There is something about Broadway. As actors we like to be noble and say it doesn't matter where you play, audiences everywhere need entertaining. But Broadway is the pinnacle. We all know it. English actors know it. Why do you think we come here?
"It is so tough and so exciting, and you can fail miserably or fail nobly. Or you can sometimes have your wildest dreams come true."

Sacred Pieces From Sardinia

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
AS of February, the I.B.M. Gallery of Science and Art will present shows from its permanent collection, and will no longer offer the loan exhibitions that have made it a vital presence in New York City during the last decade. With such scholarly shows as "Corot to Monet: The Rise of Landscape Painting in France," the splendid Tibetan showcase "Wisdom and Compassion" and highlights from several of America's treasurable smaller museums to its credit, the gallery's track record has been honorable, and sometimes a good deal more than that.
It ends, happily, in a literal blaze of glory with the filigreed, gilded altarpieces that constitute "Sardinia: Sacred Art of the 15th and 16th Centuries," organized by the Italian Ministry of Cultural and Environmental Assets and the State Archives of Cagliari, among others. No doubt the light, reflective gold paint that covers these objects lends them a mysterious, numinous glow in dark churches and monastic interiors. But at least as mysterious for the visitor is the distinctive but hard-to-define collective flavor they project, a flavor that has much to do with the rocky Mediterranean island from which they came and where they still reside today. 
 It is especially difficult to define since the art seems at a glance to be so little of a piece. The first 15th-century painting one sees in the show is a triptych of three saints who have the smooth, imperturbable demeanors associated with the early Florentine Renaissance. The second is an altarpiece or retable by the Catalan-born artist Joan Barcelo in which the crisp folds of the Virgin's robes bring Flemish painting instantly to mind. And the third, a rosy panel with the stiff figure of St. Martin dressed in red and gold damask-patterned trousers, points unmistakably to the art of northern Spain.
One of the show's most impressive works, the huge "Retable of St. Peter" (1500) by the so-called Castelsardo Master, brings stylistic and other influences together in a single work. This offers a uniquely Spanish iconography, Flemish-style landscapes and adaptations of the signature motifs of such diverse Italian painters as Perugino and Piero della Francesca. The result, spread over two dozen panels large and small, exemplifies the nervous, pungent, festive, slightly-beyond-the-fringe style that characterizes so much of Sardinia's art of these centuries.
It is a style that has everything to do with being created on an island. Sardinia was at the center of things geographically, without being central culturally. Lying in the Mediterranean between the great powers of Italy and Spain, it remained, as it does today, a marginal outpost with a subsistence economy based on farming and herding. It was aligned with Italy until 1323, then annexed by Spain, which kept it for 200 years as a maritime trading port, one that attracted not only Spanish and Italian visitors, but others from France and Germany, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
No doubt all of these countries left their cultural traces, though Sardinia was unlikely to have been visited by any of the front-rank artists who kept the major European urban centers supplied with religious and political icons. Rather it was their students or students of students who came and took on pupils of their own in Cagliari, the Sardinian capital. The big-name art that arrived on the island often took the form of engravings (in the case of, say, Albrecht Durer) or drawings (in the case of Raphael) much in the way that contemporary Western art may be known to non-Western audiences through magazine reproductions.
The Italianate strain reached a high point in the work of the Sardinian-born Pietro Cavaro, whose plush figures are among the most imposing in the show. But even his Classical late-Renaissance mode takes unexpected, quirky twists. The expressive face of the single Raphaelesque figure in his "Madonna of the Seven Sorrows" is lifted from Durer. The sky behind the Madonna's head is finicky gold punchwork, not a realistic blue. And the seven long orange lines that converge on her breast are examples of just the sort of dogmatic literalism that mainstream Renaissance painting had worked so hard to eliminate.
What one finds here, in fact, is a lesson in the way art travels outward from a culture's center to its edges and is transformed into something different, surprising, often daring. Like much Sardinian work, Cavaro's painting is a stylistic hybrid, shaped by local patronage, skills and devotional practices. Often regional legends are folded into imported formulas and images of princely magnificence are leavened with hints of everyday life. The image of the kneeling donor about to be knifed by an assassin in "The Retable of Milis" (1503) probably records a hot local news story now long forgotten, and a small panel from the St. Eligius altarpiece showing a chapel hung with flesh-colored wooden body parts refers to a type of popular worship as close to paganism as to Roman Catholicism.
Yet none of these factors fully accounts for the fantastical, slightly hallucinatory quality that makes the work in "Sardinia: Sacred Art of the 15th and 16th Centuries" so compelling. The explanation may well come back once more to the fact of its island origins, with its insularity less a sociopolitical fact than a state of mind. Like the species on Darwin's remote Galapagos, a culture like that of Sardinia -- or Ireland or Malta or Sri Lanka -- resembles those elsewhere but is different. It develops a kind of psychological isolation, in a community whose physical border is absolute and which has, no matter how often intruded upon, its own legends and myths, enthusiasms and prejudices, all of which shape its art. The resulting pervasive tang of exoticism and intensity eludes scientific description, but it has everything to do with the character of this beautiful, atmospheric show.
"Sardinia: Sacred Art of the 15th and 16th Centuries" remains at the I.B.M. Gallery of Science and Art, 590 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, through Jan. 29.

HEADLINE: Fund the Arts Broadly

 BODY:
John Dyson, Rudolph Giuliani's deputy mayor for economic development, said this week that the new administration wanted to give more support to New York's prominent cultural institutions, perhaps by cutting the budgets of less established arts groups. The more popular institutions draw tourists and therefore help the city's economy, he explained, while lesser-known groups do not, and some may be getting political handouts to boot. Though he was not sure of that.
Mr. Dyson's acknowledgment of the economic importance of the arts is most welcome. But his view is narrow. Since when does a government interested in all its citizens play reverse Robin Hood, robbing from the poor to give to the rich (or, given the weak economy, the less poor)? 
 The larger cultural institutions are indeed crucial to the city's economy. As a recent study by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey confirmed, they draw tourists, create jobs and add to the tax revenues. Last year, the study found, the arts and other cultural activities in the metropolitan area generated $9.8 billion, and nearly a quarter of that money came from tourists who said they had come to New York -- or lengthened their stays in the city -- for the museums, galleries, theaters and concerts.
Economic considerations are crucial, especially now. But New York City's cultural life represents a great deal more than money. It is part of the city's fabric, part of what sets it apart from other cities.
The smaller institutions, from the Studio Museum of Harlem to Snug Harbor on Staten Island, are important to their neighborhoods, to the people who visit them or work in them or just regard them as a vital part of their communities.
Moreover, even from a strictly economic standpoint, those less prominent institutions play a positive role. They may not lure visitors from Europe or elsewhere. But New York is not just a mecca for tourism. It also attracts young artists who come to study, learn and practice, and their presence contributes to the city's economy as well as to its vibrancy.
By looking at cultural institutions strictly through a fiscal prism, Mr. Dyson risks hurting the very city he wants to help. No doubt some arts institutions get political pork. If he is as serious as he sounds about de-politicizing arts funding, Mr. Dyson should authorize a review of the city's policy, and root out the political abuse.
He is likely to find, however, that most small groups are legitimate institutions that promote the arts and boost their neighborhoods. Those less prominent groups -- 400 of them -- shared 15 percent ($13.1 million) of the $87.3 million in city funding that went to the arts this year, while 85 percent went to the 31 major institutions on city property.
The city devotes less of its budget to the arts now than in recent years. Maybe Mr. Dyson will find a way to reverse that, without adding to an anticipated budget gap of $2.2 billion. If he does, New Yorkers can only hope that he treats all arts institutions fairly, and does not help the established ones at the expense of the less prominent.

HEADLINE: Events in Russia Send Shivers East and West;
Not I.M.F.'s Fault

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Vice President Al Gore chose the wrong target in blaming the International Monetary Fund for difficulties in Russia. The I.M.F. has no power to direct its financing to provide the social safety net Russia needs. 
 The risk now is that time will be lost by putting I.M.F. stabilization on the back burner, while a doomed attempt is made to revive the economy sector by sector. President Boris N. Yeltsin, like any other politician, may want to grasp at that straw. But the election returns suggest that Russia needs more, not less, progress against inflation -- as the I.M.F. has insisted. All the I.M.F.'s experience shows that progress toward a free market requires a more stable economy, which will attract foreign capital while building the confidence of Russians in their own future.
The Clinton Administration should not blame, but encourage the I.M.F. and support its role by supplying American leadership for adequate direct aid to alleviate suffering. There may still be time for reform with democracy to succeed. But time is running out.
