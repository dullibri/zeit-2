HEADLINE: Child Support Payments to Mothers Improved From '93 to '99 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
The number of mothers who received all the child support they were owed increased by more than 25 percent in the late 1990's, the Census Bureau has reported.
 A strong economy and stricter enforcement led more fathers to pay in full, bureau analysts said on Friday. 
 More than 2.8 million women collected all the child support owed to them, nearly 46 percent of the mothers entitled to payments in 1999. That was an increase from nearly 2.2 million, or almost 37 percent, of the mothers owed support in 1993. 
The report included other positive statistics for mothers raising children alone. More custodial mothers worked, fewer lived in poverty and fewer collected public assistance in the six years from 1993 to 1999. The 1996 welfare changes, which are up for renewal in Congress, nudged more single mothers off public assistance and into jobs.
Critics noted that the report contained no information about life for single parents since the economic decline started in 2000.
"The problem we are seeing now is that so many people are struggling again," said Geraldine Jensen, president of the Association for Children for Enforcement of Support. 
The portion of custodial mothers who received none of the child support they were owed remained relatively unchanged at 25 percent between 1993 and 1999.
Still, said David Siegal, deputy commissioner for child support enforcement for the Department of Health and Human Services, enforcement cases have increased since federal and state governments started cracking down.
The Census Bureau's survey, every two years, is the nation's only estimate of all child support paid and owed across the country, including amounts set in private agreements between parents. The Department of Health and Human Services keeps more recent figures, but only for cases that go through government collection systems.
Among custodial fathers, about 248,000 of 658,000, almost 38 percent, received the full amount of child support from absent mothers. More than 35 percent of custodial fathers in 1999 received none of the child support they were due, up from about 26 percent six years earlier, though the Census Bureau did not consider that change to be statistically significant.

HEADLINE: Summer's Storms Hurt Wine Industry in Italy 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROME, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
The floods that plagued Central Europe this summer also wreaked havoc on Italy's wine industry, ruining whole vineyards and hurting an important sector of the economy. 
 Constant rainstorms and bursts of hailstones battered vines across the country, causing one of the worst harvests in decades, with losses estimated at around $200 million. 
 "It seemed like the sky was falling," said Ernesto Abbona, who makes Marchesi di Barolo wine in Piedmont in the north. When it hailed in September, he said, he lost more than 40 percent of his vineyard. 
Mr. Abbona's ordeal is not isolated, as vintners across Europe suffered damage. Heavy rains soaked vineyards in southern Greece, scrapping the 2002 Nemea, one of the country's favorite red wines, while floodwaters postponed timely harvests in the Rhone Valley in France. 
Production in Italy, Europe's biggest winemaker after France, was hit especially hard, as bad weather reduced the wine yield to 10 percent below last year's, according to the agricultural research group Ismea. One effect may be to drive up export prices on the smaller harvest. 
Heavy rainfall in southern regions like Sicily allowed for grape-spoiling mold, while northern regions like Veneto had to contend with hail that chopped down vines. The combination proved costly for Italy. Mauro Alpagotti, director of the Italian Agriculture Confederation, said the damage had cost about $200 million.
Enzo Rivella, president of an association of Italian wine producers, said, "This is one of the most difficult harvests I've seen in 30 years, not only for the loss of production, but also for the damage to quality." 
Italian shoppers are just now starting to see the consequences of that poor harvest, as the prices of some table wines have shot up 10 percent, driven by the diminished supply and the need of producers to pay for uninsured losses. Lombardy, Pulia and Sicily all registered 20 percent drops in production, while weather damage in September to Piedmont, Veneto and other northern regions prompted the government to declare a state of natural disaster, supplying about $150 million in aid to those areas. 
The paltry harvest is also expected to increase the price of much of the wine sold in the United States.

HEADLINE: Hawaiians Find an Unlikely Eden in Las Vegas 

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE DOWNES 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
Some mornings when the beach is empty and the waves are perfect, five-foot left curls crashing gently onto water smooth as glass, Moses Mokuahi goes surfing. He savors every second of the ride, kicking out just before the swell collapses into foam and trickles into drain holes at the edge of a low concrete wall.
 "The best thing about it, it's consistent," Mr. Mokuahi said. "Every 108 seconds you got that same wave. After I catch five, six waves, I turn the system off. It puts a smile on my face the rest of the day." 
 Mr. Mokuahi, 49, a former construction foreman who moved here from Oahu six years ago, considers himself one lucky Hawaiian, and not just because he controls the only surfable body of water on the Las Vegas Strip -- the turbine-driven one he helped build at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. 
It is because he has a job -- wave-pool director -- that lets him live in a nice suburb, in a house big enough for him, his wife, their 19-year-old son and any other relatives who visit.
Never mind that Mr. Mokuahi left a rural Eden of red dirt, towering ironwood trees and the finest surfing anywhere to ride push-button waves inside a tourist-washing machine.
Las Vegas, he says, has given him material comfort he could never have attained back home. Mr. Mokuahi, a muscular, dark-haired man with a bristly mustache, misses Hawaii -- "the best place in the world to be," he says matter-of-factly. But he is not complaining.
Neither, it seems, are the tens of thousands of other Hawaiians who have joined him in this casino boomtown. A broad swath of the Hawaiian middle class -- hotel workers, retired police officers, teachers and, increasingly, nurses and other professionals -- abandoned its economically depressed home state in the last 10 years, seeking better jobs, cheaper houses and easier lives here.
This stream of migrants has merged with a deluge of visitors -- Hawaiians make 300,000 trips here every year -- to transform Las Vegas into perhaps the most Hawaiian city on the mainland.
Las Vegas has long been Hawaiians' No. 1 travel destination, a vacation Mecca's vacation Mecca, thanks to casino-sponsored charter packages that make crossing the Pacific cheaper than hopping to a neighbor island, and a well-known Hawaiian passion for gambling.
This virtual Aloha State has its own radio programs, Web sites and even casino hotels, where plainclothes security men wear aloha shirts, and restaurants and gift shops cater to obscure Hawaiian tastes and traditions, like Spam for breakfast and, bafflingly, beef jerky for the folks back home.
Las Vegas is so Hawaiian that island high schools have their reunions here -- 40 this year at the California Hotel and Casino alone. This 800-room hotel, known to Hawaiians as "the Cal," is one of a handful of hotels north of the Strip that cater almost exclusively to Hawaiians.
The irony of pilgrims streaming out of a tropical paradise into the desert, like the Rapture in reverse, was not lost on many expatriates interviewed here.
But they said the harsh facts of island life -- high unemployment and taxes, a slumping tourist economy, staggering housing costs -- justified the move. Couples can hold three jobs, many said, and never afford a house in Hawaii, where the median house price is $345,000. Nevada's median is $152,000.
"I'd be in a shack with a tin roof back home," said Stephanie Moldenhauer, a cabdriver who came here seven years ago. She and her husband, Bobby, own a 1,500-square-foot house in suburban Henderson. "The house we have here would be half a million on Kauai," she said.
Debbie Shinogi, a nurse, and her husband, Tracy, a casino employee, own a three-bedroom home in Henderson. Back in Aiea, they lived with Mr. Shinogi's parents.
"Here you can get 18 eggs for 79 cents," Ms. Shinogi said. "Back home it's two bucks or something. Cereal is $5 to $6 a box in Hawaii. Here you can get two boxes for $5. We eat out a lot, because it's so much cheaper to eat out than to cook for two people."
But Robert Parker, a sociology professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas who has written about the social costs of the southern Nevada boom, said people should consider the downside of moving here.
He ticked off a litany of Las Vegas pathologies: the nation's highest suicide rates among teenagers and the elderly; the highest per capita pedestrian fatality rate; severe air pollution; rampant asthma. 
Factor in all the bad things, he said, and there is only one honest conclusion. "This is not an affordable place to live." 
Still, the outsiders -- and not just Hawaiians -- keep coming. This city's population has exploded by nearly 86 percent since 1990, according to the census. It welcomed 35 million visitors last year. 
Las Vegas is not the only way station for the Hawaiian diaspora. California and the Pacific Northwest have lured islanders for generations. But only Las Vegas has Ohana, a magazine for Hawaiian expatriates, a group estimated at 55,000 to 65,000. Only Las Vegas has at least four stores serving Hawaiians' beef jerky needs. Only Las Vegas has the Hawaiian gambling throngs and all those high school reunions.
The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority says tiny Hawaii, the 42nd most populous state with 1.2 million residents, ranked 12th in air traffic to Las Vegas last year.
This is why Mr. Mokuahi, 2,700 miles from his hometown, spends his days surrounded by Hawaiians.
There are the lifeguards at the wave pool: Lew from Waianae, Brandon from Hilo, Jonathan from Kaneohe, Larry from Kailua and about a half-dozen others.
Then there are the people he meets in his off hours at the Cal, where the corridors ring with the mellow tones of pidgin English and elderly gamblers maneuver oxygen tanks and motorized wheelchairs among rows of blinking, bleeping slot machines.
Don Inamine, a retired schoolteacher from Oahu, is a typical Cal denizen. "I come for golf two times a year," said Mr. Inamine, 67, sitting at a lunch counter with his wife, Arlene. The other two to three yearly visits, he said, are strictly for gambling -- about four hours a day, and never more than $2,000 to $3,000 on a trip.
Repeat visitors like Mr. Inamine make life more bearable for those who have stayed. Debbie Shinogi said she and her husband play host to Hawaiians practically every month.
The Hawaiian Airlines flight one Saturday morning brought Gloria Kaauwai, Ms. Moldenhauer's mother, to McCarran International Airport. She had a large plastic ice chest sealed with duct tape.
Ms. Moldenhauer's eyes gleamed when she explained what she thought was inside. "Opihi, raw fish, laulau," she said -- perishable luau staples.
Her family visits once a year and she goes back once a year, but it is never enough.
"I wish I was on the beach," Ms. Moldenhauer said. She thinks of the friends she loves and misses. "I have videotapes of us hanging out at the beach. I have my Hawaii calendar I can look at." Her eyes brimmed with tears.
She was not the only one to muse about the cruelty of trading an organic paradise for a synthetic one.
"Eating papayas and drinking guava juice on the beach -- how do you top that? You can't," said Stephen Lum, whose Las Vegas real estate business, No Ka Oi Realty, has handled hundreds of Hawaiian relocations. "In Hawaii you have a better quality of life. The air and water are cleaner. In Vegas you have a better standard of living."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: SEARCH FOR FUGITIVES; 
Yemen Turns to Tribes to Aid Hunt for Qaeda

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: MARIB, Yemen, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Given the penchant of tribesmen in this isolated province to tote around weapons like personal bazookas, the Yemeni government is holding hostage about 40 sons of tribal leaders. 
 The sons -- between the ages of 15 and 20 -- have been detained in military prison for nine months to ensure Yemeni troops a modicum of peace while they search for fugitive members of Al Qaeda. The government believes that as long as the young men remain captive 100 miles away in Sana, the capital, any tribesman inclined to see its troops as interlopers or American stooges will think twice before opening fire. 
 "It is something ordinary in Yemen, a tradition," said Sheik Ahmed Ali bin Jallal, the leader of the 140,000-strong Abida tribe, who wears a curved dagger and a Nokia cellphone in his heavily embroidered belt. "We do it just to prove our loyalty to the president." 
President Ali Abdullah Saleh demands tribal loyalty in this particular case to fulfill his own pledge to Washington of complete cooperation in the fight against terrorism. It is expected to be a protracted struggle in a country whose traditions include fractious tribes, a certain proclivity for radical Islam and the kind of widespread poverty that can help breed extremism. 
Yemen proved a somewhat reluctant partner with the United States while investigating the suicide mission two years ago against the destroyer Cole, which killed 17 American sailors and was eventually traced to Al Qaeda. The government scoffed at the notion that Al Qaeda attracted followers inside Yemen. 
But that attitude began to shift after Sept. 11. Yemen suddenly found itself mentioned in the same breath as Afghanistan as a possible target of the United States, and the damage wrought by terrorism -- especially scaring away tourists and foreign investors -- started to hurt. The government also saw an opportunity to achieve some its own goals, like bringing the tribes to heel. 
Government raids on suspected Qaeda hide-outs have resulted in the deaths of several suspects and the seizure of explosives. Officials say the government also deployed about 400 special troops, newly trained by American teams periodically sent here, at 13 bases in the three desolate northeastern provinces most hospitable to fugitives. 
Yemeni officials and Western analysts believe the number of radicals in the country is small -- probably about 20 committed terrorists and another 100 or so sympathizers who might help organize attacks.
But the assault on the French tanker Limburg on Oct. 6 proved militants can still strike here. There have also been other attacks including explosions outside the headquarters of the Political Security Organization, which rounds up terror suspects, and grenades lobbed into the American Embassy. 
American aid in the antiterrorism fight -- most of it geared to military training and creating a coast guard -- amounts to about $100 million. It includes a computerized system of tracking who crosses the borders that was introduced with mixed results -- frequent electrical failures at some crossings mean the guards do not always use the system. 
Yemeni officials protest that Washington focuses too heavily on security matters, and President Saleh is under pressure to show that cooperating with the West in a fight widely seen as against Islam will pay off with economic development. 
The depth of Yemen's commitment remains a question. The suspicions that dogged the Cole investigation -- notably that some senior officials harbor sympathy for the militants -- have never entirely faded. 
Yemeni critics accuse the government of heeding American demands while not really uprooting sources of militancy that might alienate government supporters. 
Steps that the government boasts about, like taking over hundreds of independent high schools that specialized in religious and paramilitary training, are dismissed by critics as less about terrorism than about reducing the influence of Islah, the main Islamic opposition party. 
"In Yemen you cannot eradicate terrorism by arresting 10 or 1,000 or 2,000 people; that is no solution," said Abdel Bari Taher, a Yemeni columnist formerly prominent in the Socialist party. "The solution is to stop favoring tribal domination over civil rights and to introduce an alternative curriculum for education." 
Critics say that during the 1990's about 20 percent of the 6 million students in Yemen, a country of 18 million, went through the religious high schools and now work throughout the government. But the government is seen as reluctant to undertake a purge of militant sympathizers because it owes a debt of gratitude to the most radical elements, some Afghan veterans, who fought hard against the opposition in the 1994 civil war. 
Yemen is the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden, and some here see him as a kind of archetype holy warrior. Hundreds if not thousands of Yemenis passed through camps in Afghanistan; Yemenis have been involved in many major terrorist incidents in recent years; and at least 53 are among the prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba. 
The government has begun trying to uproot Mr. bin Laden's following. His posters and tapes of his speeches were banned. More than 100 men being held in Yemeni jails because of suspected links to terrorism are undergoing a kind of religious re-education, with government clerics explaining how Al Qaeda's violence contradicts Islam. 
President Saleh summoned various tribal leaders to give them a "with us or against us" speech, winning a public commitment from most to back the fight. But soldiers trying to storm a suspected Qaeda hide-out last December were killed by tribesmen near Sheik bin Jallal's house and the two suspects remain at large. First 10 tribal sheiks were taken hostage for a month, then each had to surrender four sons or relatives. Sheik bin Jallal's 15-year-old and other relatives are being held.
Over a Yemeni supper that included bread mash infused with thick local honey, Sheik Sinan abu Luhum, one of the most revered tribal leaders in the country, said the tribes largely helped maintain stability. He quoted a Koranic injunction to dismiss the idea that tribesmen would knowingly shelter wanted terrorists. 
"Those who make war against Allah and his apostle and spread disorder in the land shall be put to death or crucified or have their hands and feet cut off on alternative sides or be banished from the land," he intoned. "They shall be held in shame in this world and sternly punished in the next." 
Yemenis feel partly maligned in the terrorism fight, and any assault on Iraq would further sour the image of the United States, leaving members of the governing party worried that they will be painted as what one called "American agents" in parliamentary elections next spring. 
But despite fervent opposition to the American policies supporting Israel and condemning Iraq, officials maintain that the terrorism struggle will endure. 
As a first step toward changing public attitudes, the government started enforcing a ban on weapons in Sana. 
Ali M. al-Fatimy, the deputy governor of Marib, searches for the right metaphor until he decides that Kalashnikovs are to Yemeni tribesmen what baseball caps are to Americans. 
"If I go someplace I take the gun like part of my clothes," he said. "If I wasn't carrying one people would look at me oddly." Guns, he asserted, do not abet terrorism and violence. 
"Look," he said, "you've been in this province what, an hour? Have you heard any gunfire?"

HEADLINE: Bear Rages Past Wall St. To Tax Coffers 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
That the air has gone out of the stock market balloon is no secret to any American with a 401(k) retirement plan. But what that means for New York, economically and fiscally, is only now becoming clear. 
 And the picture is ugly. 
 Take, for example, state taxes. In April, May and June, New York State's personal income tax collections fell by 26.8 percent, compared with those from the same stretch of 2001, according to an analysis released last month by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany. Personal income taxes account for almost two-thirds of state revenues.
Only a tiny fraction of the decline came because fewer people were working; withholding in that period edged down just 1.4 percent. The big drop -- 31.1 percent -- came in estimated taxes, which are paid by the wealthy and reflect investment profits. 
"The bubble has burst, and now we're seeing the hangover," said Nicholas Jenny, senior policy analyst at the institute.
During the long bull market on Wall Street, both the city and state governments became accustomed to collecting (and spending) hundreds of millions of dollars a year in taxes on stock profits -- which have now dried up. So have the taxes on stock options, which during the boom times companies used to pay employees. Another huge source of income was taxes on Wall Street bonuses, which dropped sharply last year and will probably fall by another $6 billion this year, according to industry estimates.
The scope of the problem was hinted at by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who last week broke the code of political omerta by revealing that the city's budget for the current fiscal year has a $1 billion hole in it. Budget watchers were shocked, but mostly by the timing: most politicians seem to have been sworn to silence until after the election.
Tax revenues have already plunged, and will continue to tumble this year and probably next year as well. More layoffs loom on Wall Street, which has cut more than 20,000 jobs in the last year; Citigroup and J. P. Morgan recently developed plans to lay off 3,000 employees.
Not surprisingly, perhaps, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported last week that the market for expensive apartments and houses has started to weaken in New York, as has consumer spending. The loss of thousands of lucrative jobs is likely to lead to unemployment for other workers, too; each job on Wall Street supports at least two others elsewhere in the city, according to a widely accepted estimate by the Securities Industry Association, Wall Street's lobbying group. 
Meanwhile, demands on the state and city governments are likely to increase. The welfare rolls in New York City are starting to edge up, according to the Human Resources Administration, and applications for public assistance have jumped. Unemployment insurance benefits have run out for well over 100,000 New Yorkers, and it is not clear that many of them have found work.
The federal money that was supposed to help New York City recover from the World Trade Center disaster has been trickling in -- and some lawmakers are saying that millions of dollars will never arrive at all. 
All of this helps explain why budget analysts are talking about problems similar to those the city faced in the early 1990's, even though the underlying economy today is far less damaged than it was then. A decade ago, the city was reeling from the loss of almost 330,000 jobs; so far, between the recession and the terrorist attack, the city has lost about 128,000, according to the New York State Department of Labor. 
Not that there is any guarantee that the job losses have ended, though the labor picture has been stable for several months. Historically, New York has lagged behind the nation in recovering from recessions, and the national economic picture is cloudy.
"The single biggest downside risk is a double-dip U.S. recession," said Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the New York City Independent Budget Office. While economists put the chance of the economy going right back into recession without a full-fledged recovery at only one in three, she said, "that sounds pretty scary to me." 
But even without another recession, governments will still struggle, warned Robert A. Kurtter, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service, which rates city and state bonds. "There is a clear disconnect between the economy and government revenues," he said. "There is a governmental revenue recession going on."
The reason is that governments across the country have gotten used to raking in huge sums from their wealthiest citizens, who were making money in the stock market. In New York State, he noted, people with incomes of more than $200,000 make up less than 3 percent of tax filers -- but they pay almost half of the income tax.
In New York City, taxpayers who made $100,000 or more (there were about 200,000 of them in 1998) paid more than 60 percent of the income tax collected, according to the mayor's budget message this year.
That's because the wealthy were particularly flush with capital gains. Between 1994 and 1999, New York City taxpayers' income from capital gains quadrupled, rising to $21.8 billion from about $5.2 billion, according to the Independent Budget Office. Capital gains, once a relatively minor source of income, became the second largest after wages, which rose 40 percent during that time. 
But the stock market peaked in 2000, and by last year it had begun to plunge. For a time, the effects on tax collections of this were masked by a quirk of the system, because wealthy taxpayers file quarterly estimated taxes based on their previous year's results. But in April of this year, the ugly truth started to become apparent: not only were tax revenues low, but an unusually large number of filers were also due refunds.
State and city budget officials tried to adjust for lower stock-market profits, as well as for a weakening economy. The city, for example, forecast that capital gains would decline by 5 percent in 2002. 
But no one expected that the stock market would keep sliding, or that Wall Street would finally start slashing payrolls. Nor did it seem likely that bonuses would keep falling, after a 28 percent drop last year.
But that is all but certain to happen. Frank Fernandez, chief economist for the Securities Industry Association, said that "variable compensation," as the Wall Street firms call it, looks likely to come in 23 percent below last year's low level, and could be down as much as 30 percent. 
Capital-gains tax collections, which fell 38 percent last year, may drop further, perhaps by as much as 35 percent, he said. 
New York City is in many ways luckier than the state, because the city also collects real estate taxes, which are far less volatile than income taxes and make up a larger share of overall city tax revenues. Last year, while personal income tax revenues fell by almost a billion dollars, to $4.7 billion, real estate taxes rose by about half a billion dollars, to $8.7 billion, according to the New York City comptroller's office.
So far this year, income tax receipts are coming in just about where budget officials expected them to, but officials are worried about the future. As a rough rule of thumb, every 10 percent change in the Standard & Poor's 500 index causes a $250 million change in tax revenues, according to one budget official. Even after the recent rally on Wall Street, the market is still down about 20 percent this year.
And even if the stock market rally were to continue, "we've missed the bonus season," said Larian Angelo, finance director for the City Council. Budget experts widely expect the city to lower its forecast of tax revenues.
Data from the New York State comptroller's office indicates that personal income tax payments through September are about 24 percent lower than last year, with the big drops coming once again in estimated payments, not withholding. State budget officials who work for the governor have questioned the comptroller's calculations, noting that he is running for governor against their boss.
In any event, they say, what really matters is how revenues are holding up against the state budget forecast, and that so far taxes are coming in above expectations. But Carole E. Stone, the state budget director, did not rule out future problems. "There are potential risks to revenues" early next year, she said in a statement, "connected to bonuses, capital gains and withholding, and we continue to monitor these risks closely."
The source, the cause of those risks is pretty obvious. As the securities industry's Mr. Fernandez put it, "Virtually all the problems New York State has are from Wall Street."

HEADLINE: Homes Perched on Seawalls Hang in Balance of Dispute 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SOLANA BEACH, Calif. 

 BODY:
Staring up at his home here, Paul Santina sees dreams collapsing. 
 He and thousands of others who own beachfront castles atop sandstone bluffs in California are watching their foundations disappear, one grain of sand at a time. From a beach that is submerged at high tide, Mr. Santina points 80 feet up to his neighbor's patio, which has hung precariously since this summer, when the bluff below it collapsed. 
 "Over the last 18 to 24 months," Mr. Santina said, "it has accelerated from one or two bluff failures a year to one or two a month."
Mr. Santina, who leads a group called the Beach and Bluff Conservancy, sees salvation in sand replenishment, artificial reefs and especially seawalls, hills of rock or concrete that reinforce the bluffs.
Environmental groups say such measures favor property owners at the expense of the public good and advocate the opposite approach, a program of "planned retreat."
California has the least restrictive seawall regulations in the country, environmental groups say. For example, Texas, North Carolina and South Carolina prohibit seawalls. This year state legislation was introduced that would make the permit process for seawalls more stringent. Faced with fierce opposition from homeowners and builders' groups, it has since been shelved, but a new bill is being prepared for next year.
The seeds for the current beach erosion were sown by bulldozers from the 1960's to the 1980's, when prime beachfront real estate was rapidly and densely developed. 
Dave Skelly, a coastal engineer, said beaches had been robbed of sand by California's 1,400 dams and reservoirs, 200 debris basins, sprawling housing tracts and miles of concrete stream diversions. Encroaching development has "narrowed the beaches to the point that there is no sand," he said.
A recent study found that more than 100 of California's 1,100 miles of coast were armored, or shored up, with seawalls or jetties -- a 400 percent increase since 1970. Environmental groups argue that such measures improperly occupy public beaches, making them unusable.
"There is no vested right to build a seawall on public property," Jim Jaffee, director of California Beach Advocates, said. 
The Surfrider Foundation, an environmental group that claims 35,000 members, says that by "fixing" the shoreline and preventing natural sand release from bluffs, seawalls contribute to erosion, creating the need for more seawalls. 
Many seawalls exist because of an apparent contradiction in the state Coastal Act. Part of the act states that property may be developed only if a seawall is not required, but another part says that if an emergency can be proved, a seawall "shall" be allowed to protect a structure.
To address this loophole, Assemblywoman Patricia Wiggins, who represents Napa County in Northern California, sponsored a bill that changes "shall" to "may." This proposed change drew opposition from homeowners and builders, who say the shift would allow the commission to let homes fall into the sea. Surfrider and other environmental groups say planned retreat, and not armoring, is the best approach. In the short term, planned retreat includes temporary seawalls and sand replenishment to protect property. In the long term, the state government would buy out beachfront property at a discount while allowing homeowners to stay for 50 years. Then the houses would be demolished and the bluffs restored to a natural state. 
Giving up an entire row of prime beachfront homes is simply untenable to Mayor Marcia Smerican of Solana Beach and many of her beachfront constituents. "You can't do it," Ms. Smerican said. "You go to the first row, the second and then what about infrastructure? Highway 101? Beach access? Restaurants?"
Surfrider says Ms. Smerican is ignoring an environmental impact report her office authorized. The report showed that erosion rates in Solana Beach equaled 27 to 40 feet every 100 years -- not enough to pass the first row of homes.
Solana Beach residents hope to save their homes by creating a "hazard abatement district," financed largely by homeowners and a bond issue. The district would allow a long seawall designed to resemble the coastal bluffs, long-term sand replenishment and underwater "sand retention" devices or artificial reefs.
The coastal commission, California Beach Advocates and Surfrider Foundation are skeptical. "Sand retaining structures keep sand on one beach by robbing it from another," Christopher J. Evans, executive director of Surfrider, said.
Last year, as part of a $17.5 million project for San Diego County beaches, financed by the federal and state governments, Solana Beach had 200,000 cubic yards of sand pumped in. The project was considered a success in many communities, but little of this sand remains here.
"Property owners want private property rights, but we, the taxpayers, have to pay these subsidies so they can live on the front row," Mr. Evans said.
Mr. Santina countered that not building more seawalls would be disastrous for the community.
"Let houses fall into the ocean, let the community's economy be destroyed, ruin tourism and let kids get killed from falling bluffs," Mr. Santina said. "We want to rebuild the beaches."

At Least 67 Civilians Dead After Moscow Siege Ends
Russian troops violently crushed a 57-hour hostage siege in Moscow, freeing almost 750 people from two days' captivity and ending a terrorist threat aimed at destroying President Vladimir V. Putin's Chechnya war strategy and even his political career. The civilian death toll was estimated to be at least 67. The government said 50 guerrillas were killed. 1

Russian officials said that they launched the raid because the guerrillas had begun to kill hostages, but according to official statements and witnesses' accounts, the predawn assault began more than three hours after the first two hostages were shot. 20

The mass confusion in the hours after the siege, when sick and wounded hostages were rushed to at least three hospitals in Moscow at dawn, left hundreds of relatives searching frantically for family members across the city. 20

Call for North Korea to Disarm
At the Asia Pacific Economic Conference the United States, Japan and South Korea issued a joint statement calling for North Korea to dismantle its clandestine nuclear weapons program "in a prompt and verifiable manner" and warned Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader, that his "relations with the international community" hinged on his quick compliance. 1

Wellstone's Death Renews Scramble in Senate Races
The political disarray caused by the death of Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota put a new focus on the battle for control of the Senate, leaving strategists in both parties scrambling in a national struggle that remains too close to call little more than a week before Election Day. 1

As Democrats huddled in St. Paul to begin the delicate process of replacing United States Senator Paul Wellstone on the Nov. 5 ballot, associates of Walter F. Mondale, the former vice president, said he was likely to heed the growing pleas from party leaders to join the campaign. 32

The Search for the Snipers
The police had feared a bloody end to the 23-day manhunt in the Washington-area sniper shootings. But the peaceful arrests of John Allen Muhammad and John Lee Malvo brought an abrupt coda to an investigation full of dead-end leads followed by a rapid reversal of fortune. 1

The man who co-owned the blue 1990 Chevrolet Caprice that has been linked to the sniper attacks was taken into custody in Michigan. 35

Debate Over Beach Homes
The foundations of thousands of beachfront homes in California are slipping into the sea. Homeowners see salvation in sand replenishment and seawalls, but environmental groups say those measures come at the expense of the public good. 24

An Emory University professor resigned after an academic panel released a report strongly critical of his research for a widely debated book about the history of guns in America. 26

Many Factors as Two Cities Compete for Olympic Games
As members of the United States Olympic Committee prepare to choose between New York and San Francisco as their candidate for the site of the 2012 Summer Games, they say they are considering factors that range from how the cities treat their favorite sports to their feelings about a sympathy vote for New York. 39

Tax Losses Equal Budget Woes
Budget analysts are talking about problems for New York City similar to those faced in the early 1990's, even though the underlying economy today is far less damaged than it was then. Much of the budget shortage can be blamed on the loss of tax revenues the city and state governments had grown accustomed to during the long bull market on Wall Street. 39

HEADLINE: In Search of Good Health? Try a Bad Attitude. 

BYLINE:  By HENRY FOUNTAIN

 BODY:
NOT to sound too negative about it, but there's yet more evidence that this power-of-positive-thinking idea may not be all it's cracked up to be.
 Survey findings released last week at a meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncology show that cancer support groups do not help patients live longer. Edzard Ernst, a professor of medicine at the University of Exeter in Britain, and colleagues reviewed earlier studies on the issue and found no evidence for the belief, held by some doctors and patients, that the good vibrations gleaned from talking with others who are in the same boat can do as much to prolong life as any physical treatment. 
 The researchers were quick to point out that they have no doubt that positive thinking helps patients feel better and improves the quality of their lives. It just doesn't add days to them. 
That may be a bitter pill for those who urge the grouchy and grumpy among us to cheer up. Norman Vincent Peale, who convinced millions that worry, doubt and defeatism can be overcome, might be overcome himself were he alive to hear the news.
All in all, this hasn't been a bull market for positive thinkers. Two decades ago, in the Reagan era, it might have been morning in America, but now, with terrorism, snipers, threats of war and economic anemia, it's the middle of the night. We're tossing and turning, anxious and angry thoughts racing through our heads, while somewhere a faucet goes drip, drip, drip.
Do we really need to look on the bright side?
Barbara S. Held, a psychologist and professor at Bowdoin College, argues that it's time to end what she calls the "tyranny of the positive attitude in America."
"It's gotten worse since 9/11," she said. "There's less tolerance for the expression of negativity. You're labeled unpatriotic, as if you've somehow given in to the enemy."
Negativity is not such a bad thing for some people, Dr. Held said, from the rude curmudgeon who wallows in it to the normally upbeat person having the occasional bad day. "Insisting that they smile and look on the bright side may backfire and make them feel even worse," she said.
(Want proof that negativity works? Look no further than Jimmy Carter, the man who preceded Mr. Reagan and whose 1979 "malaise" speech is perhaps the most public display of negativity in recent memory. He was just awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.)
"There's much to be gained from appreciating our negative thoughts and feelings," said Gerald Amada, a psychologist and the former director of the mental health program at the City College of San Francisco. It is important to acknowledge that negative thoughts can serve a purpose. "We need to take a morally neutral position with respect to angry emotions, not always see them as destructive and all-consuming," said Dr. Amada, the author of "The Power of Negative Thinking" (Madison Books, 1999).
Even when it seems that negative thoughts should dissipate -- as with the apparent resolution last week of the sniper case in the Washington area -- there are those who will stay gloomy, angry or anxious.
"Some people might say, 'What are you angry about -- he's been caught,' " said Dr. Held, whose book "Stop Smiling, Start Kvetching" was published last year by St Martin's Press. "But now there's a whole new dimension to life. There may be more snipers. Life is more unstable than we ever conceived of."
But perpetually anxious people have their own form of bulletproofing. Their Kevlar consists of setting expectations low, preparing for the worst possible outcome and precisely planning how to prevent it from happening.
Julie K. Norem, a psychologist and professor at Wellesley College, calls this defensive pessimism. "This focuses them on things they can do, and away from the anxiety," she said. "An awful lot of people do learn how to do it for themselves in a concrete way."
ANGER can help some people manage anxiety, too. "One of the things that makes anxiety so awful is that you feel out of control," said Dr. Norem, the author of "The Positive Power of Negative Thinking" (Basic Books, 2001). "Anger is an energizing emotion. With anger you feel more in control."
Whether venting anger or maintaining a generally glum attitude has actual health benefits, however, is an open question, Dr. Norem said, although she pointed to one study that showed a correlation between cheerfulness in men and earlier mortality.
"You don't want to make too much of it," she said. "But for cranks like me, it was encouraging."

HEADLINE: Candidate Learns Limits of 9/11 Resume 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
THIRTEEN months ago Joe Finley of Fort Salonga was just another firefighter commuting between a home in the Long Island suburbs and a firehouse in the city.
 These days he is a Republican candidate for Congress, testing whether residents of Long Island's Second Congressional District will show their esteem at the ballot box for a fireman who rushed to the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 and stayed on to toil in the ruins. 
 Mr. Finley, 46, a third-generation city fireman who has never run for public office before, became the first to try to parlay his experience of 9/11 into a political career. But the campaign has languished, and it appears overwhelmingly likely that he will be rejected by the voters. 
Mr. Finley has done all the things candidates do in an otherwise conventional campaign hampered by limited money. He strongly backs President Bush's policies on Iraq, believes decisive action against global terrorists is long overdue, views a vibrant economy as the best defense against terrorism, and supports heightened domestic security. He has laced into Steve Israel, the Democratic incumbent, calling him a spin doctor who "tries to play both sides of the fence" and "wants to be all things to all people."
Sensitive to perceptions that he might be exploiting the mantle of heroism worn by all city firefighters, Mr. Finley has rejected the hero label. His intent, he said, is to continue in Congress the service he could no longer perform as a firefighter because of lung damage sustained during the trade center rescue effort. 
"The heroes from 9/11 are the 343 firefighters and the police officers and first responders who were lost that day," he said. "I am just somebody that went there and tried to help." 
But beginning on the day in June when he announced his candidacy from the firehouse at 29th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan where he has worked for the past 12 years, he has repeatedly invoked his firefighter family and 9/11 credentials.
Mr. Finley, who took an unpaid leave from the department to run, said he was convinced he would win if voters knew of his service. His problem, he and others said, was getting out the word while running a very low-budget campaign.
His low profile with voters stood out in a survey Global Strategy Group of Manhattan did for Mr. Israel earlier this month. 
The survey showed Mr. Israel leading Mr. Finley by more than two to one and found that Mr. Finley was "still completely unknown" to the great majority of district voters. Results were based on the responses of 400 likely voters in the Second District, which includes all of the Town of Huntington and parts of Smithtown, Islip, Babylon, Oyster Bay and Hempstead towns.
Mr. Israel, 44, of Huntington, who is running for a second term, said he had raised more than $1 million in the past two years and would spend it on "a 100 percent positive campaign." Mr. Israel said Mr. Finley was due "respect and honor." But he said voters wanted a congressman "who has the experience and the leadership to make a difference on issues that affect their everyday life."
"This election is about each candidate's positions and achievements on specific issues," he said. He said his record showed his work to improve health, economic and Social Security, and to secure $40 million in federal money for constituents.
Mr. Finley has received some national media attention because of the 9/11 connection. But Amy Walter, a political analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report in Washington, said Mr. Israel appeared almost a presumptive winner.
"Had Joe Finley been a TV repairman this would never have been a story that got national attention," Ms. Walter said. "But I see nothing to suggest that Steve Israel is vulnerable."
"To run simply as somebody who was involved in the rescue effort of Sept. 11 is a nice profile, but it's not enough substance to be elected to Congress," she added. 
Mr. Finley and Mr. Israel do have differences. Mr. Finley favors allowing workers to put a portion of Social Security taxes into personal retirement accounts. Mr. Israel opposes what he calls privatizing Social Security. Mr. Finley said Mr. Israel has been soft in his support for President Bush's antiterrorism and Iraq policies. Mr. Israel describes himself as "one of the most hawkish Democrats in the House of Representatives."
Political analysts and politicians said the shape of the reapportioned Second District was yet another disadvantage for the Republican challenger. Solidly Republican areas along the South Shore are now in the Third Congressional District, strengthening the hold of the incumbent Republican Peter T. King, while the Second District gained Democratic voters. The district was so uninviting that the Republicans' initial choice, Allan Binder of the Suffolk County Legislature, noted it as a reason for withdrawing from the race.
Richard H. Schaffer, the Suffolk Democratic Party chairman, said Mr. Finley was running a one-dimensional campaign.
"We all, including Steve, would agree that we thank him for his service," he said. "But certainly he hasn't mentioned anything beyond that."
Mr. Schaffer said it was "probably cynical political handlers" who told Mr. Finley to emphasize being a firefighter at the World Trade Center.
But Mr. King said running as a hero was nothing new in American history. "You have guys who were war heroes, John Glenn who was an astronaut, and decorated cops," Mr. King said. "Joe is a very solid guy. I certainly wouldn't say he's exploiting anything."
Anthony Apollaro, the Suffolk Republican chairman, said Mr. Finley "probably listened to a lot of the same kind of advice that John Kennedy did."
The only other New York firefighter running for Congress is opposing Mr. Finley and Mr. Israel. John Keenan, 41, a lieutenant from West Sayville, is the Green Party candidate in the race.
Unlike Mr. Finley, Mr. Keenan has hardly mentioned his firefighter status or the time he spent at the trade center. "When I first announced my campaign everybody asked me what was the 9/11 connection," he said. "My reply was that it has nothing to do with my decision to run."
"I lost brothers too," he said. "Just because I don't talk about it doesn't mean I care less."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Lost Hurrah; 
A Senator's Death and the Fight for Congress

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
SENATOR PAUL WELLSTONE, the Minnesota Democrat who died in a plane crash on Friday, was a partisan Democrat and proud of it. In the Senate, he was the guardian of the left, a man "of conviction, who never swayed from his beliefs, even when he was fighting a lonely battle," said Senator Phil Gramm, the conservative Republican of Texas.
 It was not much of a surprise this month when Mr. Wellstone -- in the midst of a tight re-election battle that he very well might have lost -- defied the Democratic leadership and joined 22 other senators in voting against President Bush's Iraq resolution. 
 Mr. Wellstone was the most unusual of politicians running for re-election these days: happy to reside on the edge of the political scale, to take potentially damaging stands. As such, his death highlighted what seems to have been missing from both parties in the desultory exercise that has passed for a campaign for Congress this year.
The midterm election of 2002 should be one of the most captivating nonpresidential campaigns in 20 years. Republicans believe they can take back the Senate, perhaps more so after the tragedy of Mr. Wellstone's death, and Democrats believe they can win back the House. There are tight contests for governor taking place in a half-dozen of the most populous states.
The economy is unsteady, and the nation is talking about a war in Iraq. Also, this is the first national election since the Sept. 11 attacks, which leaders in both parties thought would revive public attention to elections and government.
Yet as Election Day creeps slowly, and almost unnoticed, upon the country, this election has stirred little interest. 
"The intensity is not high," said Marc Racicot, the Republican Party chairman, with understatement.
The midterm campaign has been competing, in a losing bid for attention, with a barrage of compelling events, from the debate over Iraq to the hunting down of the sniper outside of Washington to the crash of Mr. Wellstone's plane. There is little evidence that Americans are paying much mind to who is seeking to lead them.
But why should they?
Since at least 1992, when Bill Clinton won the White House by, in part, appropriating traditionally Republican issues, the nation's two political parties have increasingly sounded the same notes during campaigns.
If the Republicans were left at the gate in 1992, they have surely caught up this year, blurring the lines on everything from prescription drug coverage to corporate malfeasance to the handling of Social Security.
Democrats and Republicans are lamenting the prospect of another election with low voter turnout, but in truth, they have only themselves to blame. What initially had been seen as a clever, if perhaps cynical, gambit for political advantage has ended up giving voters a choice between beige and brown.
Mr. Wellstone was the exception. He knew when he voted against the Iraq resolution that it would become an issue in his campaign. By contrast, consider what has transpired in this campaign, at least outside the boundaries of Minnesota. 
The Democrats have sought to turn the election on domestic issues and the economy; the Republicans have sought to make it a debate, to a large extent, about foreign policy and national security. But for the most part, the response of the opposition party has not been to engage in a real debate, but to go along -- or at least appear to be going along -- with exercises in legislative sleight-of-hand.
A voter examining the scene this year would have a hard time "telling the difference between these two parties and why they should support one over the other," said Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic media consultant. 
"There is a major definitional question about what constitutes a Democrat, and what a Democratic platform is, and what are the differences between the candidates in this new world of ours," she said.
This fall, Republican candidates are talking tough about corporate wrongdoers and advancing plans that would subsidize prescription drug costs for seniors -- and they are doing so with the vigor of, well, Democrats.
In Maryland last week, the Republican candidate for governor, Rep. Bob Ehrlich, who has a long record of voting against gun control legislation, attacked his Democratic rival, Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, for the state's failure to check the criminal backgrounds of prospective gun purchasers.
FOR more than a year, many Republicans, including Mr. Bush, had advanced the idea of funneling part of Social Security proceeds into private investment accounts. The last place to look this year for a debate on whether this money should be invested in the private market -- an intriguing enough idea -- is on the campaign trail.
On the other side of the aisle, the Democratic Party leadership quickly fell in line behind Mr. Bush when he requested authorization to oust Saddam Hussein, despite severe misgivings by many members.
For all the talk about the potency of the economy as an issue, Democrats have, with a few notable exceptions, steered far away from what is probably the sharpest point of contrast between the two parties: Mr. Bush's $1.3 trillion tax cut, and what a few Democrats argue is the damage it has done to the nation's economy. (And yes, Mr. Wellstone voted against, and spoke out forcefully against, the tax cuts.)
"In the end, the Democrats haven't been able to say, 'We have a different point of view,' " said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, a polling institute.
Democrats argue that their biggest problem this cycle has been trying to break through the roar of competing stories.
"The way the media works today, it's kind of a pack story of the day and things start up sometimes slowly and than you get a fever pitch on something like the sniper story, and it kind of pushes aside everything else," said Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader. "Now that that's over, I think the economy dominates the stage."
Yet even some Democrats suggested that the reason the party wasn't getting heard was that it didn't have much to say. 
"I don't think they had a coherent plan for how to do it -- except to say it or to wish it," Ms. Gorlin said of an economic plan by fellow Democrats. "But the platform to take us there -- well, I never saw it."
Inevitably, the homogenization of American politics favors the status quo, even during disquieting times, which is why an increasing number of analysts believe it is unlikely that the Democrats will win back the House -- and now may even lose their one-seat hold on the Senate.
Some Democrats are surprised by how this race seems to be turning out. But in the end, why should they be? Why throw out the rascals for a new cast of rascals? 
At least with Mr. Wellstone, Minnesota voters knew what they were getting.

HEADLINE: Leadership Struggle Inside Canada's Governing Party Intensifies 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
The parliamentary election is more than a year away, but the campaign to replace Prime Minister Jean Chretien entered its first critical phase this week with ministers from the governing Liberal Party sharpening their sabers for a rough internal struggle for the party leadership.
 With the economy performing well, no overriding issue has emerged to replace the defining issues of recent campaigns like sovereignty for Quebec and free trade with the United States. 
 But a robust debate on political ethics is starting. It comes after a series of cabinet resignations this year prompted by disclosures that government contracts had been given to ministers' friends and contributors to the Liberal Party. Ethics is viewed as the principal vulnerability for the Liberals, although the main center-right and leftist opposition parties appear too splintered to take full advantage at this point. 
The leading contender to replace Mr. Chretien, former Finance Minister Paul Martin, has been shielded from the disgust with the party's ethics. Mr. Martin was forced to resign in June for political reasons and he is seen as a rival to Mr. Chretien. But Mr. Chretien remains a powerful force within the party, and he publicly challenged Mr. Martin after the former minister gave his first major policy speech of the campaign, calling for sweeping political changes in the parliamentary system.
Mr. Martin has a big campaign war chest and an effective grass-roots organization throughout Canada, but a handful of challengers have emerged in recent days who appear ready to attack him as too conservative to lead the left-leaning party.
Heritage Minister Sheila Copps, a dark-horse candidate, blamed Mr. Martin's 1995 budget cuts for soaring college tuition. "The pendulum is swinging back," she said in an interview in The Globe and Mail. "One of the values of a national government is educational accessibility."
Mr. Martin's chief accomplishment as finance minister for eight years was balancing the federal budget in 1995 after years of deficits. The policy helped lower interest rates and inflation but also cut spending for education, housing and other social services. Her call for a "debate of ideas" was viewed as a call to revive the party's traditional policy of generous spending.
Since Mr. Chretien announced in August that he would step down in 2004 rather than run for a fourth term, he has tried to keep the jockeying to succeed him in check. On Tuesday, he dropped his insistence that cabinet members refrain from raising money or organizing for a party leadership convention scheduled for November 2003.
Organizers for Ms. Copps, Deputy Prime Minister John Manley and Industry Minister Allan Rock began working to challenge Mr. Martin.
In a speech on Monday, Mr. Martin signaled that he intended to break from Mr. Chretien's tight-fisted control of the House of Commons, promising to give backbenchers more independence and power over legislation. He said it was unacceptable that the overriding question in Ottawa relevant to getting things done was "Who do you know in the P.M.O.?" -- the prime minister's office.
Mr. Chretien shot back: "I think that Mr. Martin knew somebody in the P.M.O. that was pretty important. It was myself. And he did pretty well with me."
For the opposition, the top candidate to emerge is Stephen Harper of the center-right Canadian Alliance party. He is considered a long shot unless he can make a coalition with the Progressive Conservative Party.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: THE HOUSE; 
In 4 Races, an Incumbent Is Guaranteed to Lose

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER with PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: COLLINSVILLE, Ill., Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Ordinarily, being a member of the House of Representatives is one of the safest jobs in America. With the advantages of free mailings, free travel and political action committee money, 96.7 percent of incumbents were re-elected in 1996, 1998 and 2000 combined.
 But this year, at least four incumbents will lose the general election. In four districts, incumbents are running against other incumbents because of lost House seats and redistricting, the political equivalent of downsizing. Here in southern Illinois, where cornfields become St. Louis suburbs, the loser will be Representative David Phelps, a Democrat who says, "I'm for working America; he's for corporate America," or Representative John Shimkus, a Republican who says, "I never apologize for voting to cut taxes." 
 There are such pairings in Connecticut, Mississippi and Pennsylvania, and only in the central Pennsylvania district around Harrisburg does the Democrat, Representative Tim Holden, appear to be ahead.
While no single small set of districts will determine control of the House, campaign officials in both parties agree that the uphill road Democrats face in these 4 prominent races emphasizes the difficulty of their challenge. If Republicans do win 3 of these 4, that means the Democrats will need a net gain of 9 in the other 35 or so competitive races to control the House.
Howard Wolfson, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Democrats had one substantial advantage in the Connecticut, Illinois and Pennsylvania races -- well-organized get-out-the-vote efforts. But while Mr. Holden has managed to stay financially competitive, all three Democrats are being outspent.
In Connecticut's new Fifth District, the legislative mapmaking made for an even start. It has equal parts of the old districts of Representatives Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of New Britain, and Jim Maloney, Democrat of Danbury. 
In Mississippi, action by a federal court and inaction by the Justice Department on a plan by the Democratic Legislature produced a district that the Republican, Charles W. Pickering Jr., cannot lose to the Democrat, Ronnie Shows. The Pennsylvania district was created with more of Representative George W. Gekas's old district than of the Democrat Tim Holden's old district.
Here in Southern Illinois, not only is 60 percent of the new 17th District old Shimkus territory, but that territory falls in the St. Louis media market, where Mr. Phelps needs to introduce himself but cannot afford to advertise. Only the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is broadcasting his praises here, while Mr. Shimkus, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the drug industry through the United Seniors Association are promoting the Republican on television.
Mr. Shimkus and Mr. Phelps are firm supporters of gun ownership and opponents of abortion. Mr. Shimkus is smoother; Mr. Phelps, a singer and songwriter, is folksier.
Meeting with the farm bureau in Edwardsville on Wednesday, Mr. Shimkus argued that he was no rubber stamp for the House G.O.P. leadership, saying he did not want Congress to recess before adopting an energy bill, drought relief and a domestic security measure. In Godfrey on Thursday, Mr. Phelps insisted the issue was the economy, and denounced Republicans for opposing an increase in the minimum wage. 
Mr. Shimkus started slowly, but he claims his most recent poll gives him a 52 to 36 percent lead. The Phelps camp argues that it is much closer, as does Andrew Theising, assistant professor of political science at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville. But Mr. Theising says Mr. Phelps will need an exceptional Democratic turnout to have any real chance. 
Representative Tom Davis of Virginia, leader of the N.R.C.C., calls Pennsylvania's new 17th District the most Republican of the three seriously contested member-to-member races, and says it is the only one his side might lose.
The reason is the candidates. Mr. Holden, 45, has outhustled Mr. Gekas, 72. He told retired federal employees on Monday, "This election is about the future of the people the new 17th Congressional District."
Mr. Gekas helps that argument along when, in response to charges that his past votes sought to end cost-of-living increases for Social Security, he once said that happened in the time of Julius Caesar. Another time he said it was in Charlemagne's era. He has been in Congress for 20 years.
Mr. Holden calls himself a conservative on social issues and an advocate of a balanced budget. But he said the 2001 tax cut favored the rich and called the Republican prescription drug bill a sham. 
Mr. Gekas played the piano for senior citizens at the Shoemakers V.F.W. hall on Tuesday and assured them that Social Security was safe from any cuts or delays in payments. 
At a Republican dinner in Millerstown, he praised the president for pushing foreign trade. That mattered, he said, "not just because it creates jobs, not just because it bolsters the enterprise instinct of Americans, but because it will sustain the economy, build the economy, grow the economy and thus be able to feed and empower our armed services for the struggles that lie ahead."
The Holden camp says its polls show him leading by 10 percentage points. G. Terry Madonna, a pollster and professor at Millersville University, finds that plausible and says of Mr. Gekas: "Every now and then legislators run the string out. They get so removed that people don't think they care enough."
Mr. Holden and Mr. Phelps are helped by Democrats at the top of their tickets running far ahead in their races for governor, Edward Rendell in Pennsylvania and Rod Blagoyevich in Illinois. 
Mr. Maloney gets no such help in Connecticut, where Gov. James G. Rowland, a Republican, seems a safe bet for re-election.
Various public polls show Mrs. Johnson, moderate Republican, running 16 to 18 percentage points ahead. Her 10 terms on the House Ways and Means Committee have given her a marked fund-raising advantage. As of Oct. 16, Mrs. Johnson had raised $2.9 million, compared with $1.67 million for Mr. Maloney; she also had about $1 million on hand, compared with slightly more than $450,000 for Mr. Maloney.
In a race between two tough incumbents whose records are more alike than opposite, in a district with more independent voters than either Republicans or Democrats, most experts agree that her money has made the crucial difference. 
While Mr. Maloney has sought to portray Mrs. Johnson as more concerned with the well-being of large health maintenance organizations than their patients, she has criticized him as a back-bencher with only a small fraction of her influence in a Republican-led House. 
"It's very important for your congressman to be a very strong voice," Mrs. Johnson, the leader of the Ways and Means subcommittee that oversees Medicare and Medicaid spending, told an audience at a debate with Mr. Maloney in Southbury, Conn. 
But Mr. Maloney points to her 20-year tenure as evidence that she is beholden to special interests. He renewed his promise to retire after his next term, his third, if he wins it.

HEADLINE: U.S. and 2 of Its Allies Warn North Korea on Atomic Arms 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
The United States, Japan and South Korea issued a joint statement here today calling on North Korea to dismantle its clandestine nuclear weapons program "in a prompt and verifiable manner" and warned Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader, that his "relations with the international community" hinged on his quick compliance with the demand.
 The statement was issued after considerable behind-the-scenes diplomacy by the United States to form a common front with the Asian allies against North Korea's project to enrich uranium in its latest attempt to develop atomic weapons. But it stopped short of threatening the complete economic isolation of North Korea that the Bush administration has talked about in the last week. 
 The statement said Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan, who traveled to North Korea to normalize relations just before the nuclear disclosure, warned today that "normalization talks would not be concluded" until the nuclear issue was fully resolved. That statement was considered crucial by American officials because Japan is the largest potential source of trade and investment for North Korea. 
The statement came as the administration seemed increasingly anxious that members of the United Nations Security Council -- including Mexico, the host of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting that started here today -- are still unwilling to give Washington a broad latitude to strike at President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. 
The French said they would introduce their own resolution if the Security Council does not reach a consensus on the Bush proposal. Page 8. 
President Vicente Fox of Mexico told President Bush today that his country was still consulting with France and Russia, among other nations. Mexico holds a pivotal vote on the Security Council as it debates how to confront Iraq. 
Mexico, France and Russia have pursued an alternative resolution that Mr. Bush finds too constraining, and he warned anew today with some frustration in his voice that he has told the world "in speech after speech after speech" that "if the U.N. won't act, if Saddam Hussein won't disarm, we will lead a coalition to disarm him."
Underscoring the president's impatience with the six-week-long debate in the United Nations, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said today that "we have reach the point where we have to make a few fundamental decisions in the early part of next week" about whether the United Nations is ready to pass a resolution that Mr. Bush believes will make it clear to Mr. Hussein that failure to disarm will result in an attack. 
"If resolution is not possible," said Secretary Powell, who had argued strongly this summer that any war with Iraq would have far more legitimacy if the United States first went to the United Nations, "then let's come to that realization and move forward."
Mr. Bush's effort today to manage the twin crises of Iraq and North Korea was a study in two very different diplomatic approaches. The president and his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, made it clear that the White House had just about run out of patience with the continuing debate over Iraq, and even the more patient Secretary Powell said "we can't continue to have a debate that never ends."
But on North Korea, where administration officials have concluded that no real military option is available because of the North's huge array of conventional weapons within easy reach of Seoul, the South Korean capital, Mr. Bush seems content to engage in the kind of slow consensus building that his critics say has been missing from the Iraq debate. In the 10 days since the White House made public North Korea's disclosure that it has violated a 1994 agreement to freeze its weapons in return for Western energy help, American diplomats have toured Asia, Russia and Western Europe to piece together a common declaration that a North Korean nuclear weapon could not be tolerated.
Administration officials make no secret of where they are headed: They want to win agreement on an economic isolation of North Korea, already one of the world's least developed and most isolated nations, if it refuses to dismantle the new nuclear project. An older nuclear program, involving the production of plutonium at a nuclear reactor site called Yongbyon, appears to have remained inactive.
The United States is not talking directly to the North Koreans after the meeting early this month where the existence of the program was disclosed, Secretary Powell said today. But Japan and South Korea are going ahead with previously scheduled talks. A senior Japanese official here said today that "we have no plans to give economic assistance to North Korea" before the nuclear issue and the question of abducted Japanese citizens are resolved.
Secretary Powell was equally forceful on that point after the North Koreans, in a statement on Friday, said they would negotiate about the program only if the United States signs a nonaggression pact. "You can't violate an agreement and then show up and say, 'We violated this agreement, what will you pay us for this violation in order to get out of the violation,' " he told reporters. 
When that issue came up in the 1990's, North Korea said part of the deal is the withdrawal of all American troops from South Korea, which today number around 37,000. In the statement today, however, Mr. Bush repeated an assurance he made in February shortly after calling North Korea part of the "axis of evil" -- that the "United States has no intention of invading North Korea."
Part of the American strategy seems to be to wait for South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, to leave office in a few months. Mr. Kim, a Nobel Prize winner, built his legacy on engagement with the North, and he seems more reluctant to follow the path of isolation. Today, he said very little in public.
But not all of those here are convinced of the urgency of the problem. The Russian prime minister, Mikail M. Kasyanov, said here on Friday that North Korea and its newly disclosed nuclear weapon program posed no danger to the world.
"We do not have any evidence and proof that North Korea holds any threat," he said.
Mr. Bush arrived in this sealed-off resort early today, under bright blue skies after a hurricane blew through 180 miles away. He met his host, President Fox, for a conversation that was dominated by the American counterterrorism agenda and issues of immigration that seemed on the verge of making progress before the Sept. 11 attack. But after the meeting, their seventh in 22 months, the two men appeared to be at an amiable impasse.
Mr. Bush said he recognized Mr. Fox's desires for legal rights for undocumented Mexicans in the United States. But the two did not reach any accord on that issue, or on the question of heavily subsidized American agricultural imports, which threaten to swamp Mexican farmers and businesses, driving even more migrants north.
Nor did Mr. Bush win Mexico's pivotal support in the Security Council vote on Iraq. Mr. Fox remained noncommittal on the American desire for a resolution that could lead to military action against Iraq.
The leaders will announce on Sunday an accord aimed at achieving "'the twin goals of enhanced security against terrorist threats and continued facilitation of the movement of goods, capital and people." According to a copy of the agreement, they will "freeze the assets of terrorists and their supporters without delay," block them from "accessing the international financial system," and "investigate and prosecute money launderers and terrorist financiers." 
In the focus on terrorism, many of the past initiatives of the meetings seemed almost ignored. There was little discussion of global financial stability efforts, which dominated these meetings during the financial crises of the 1990's, particularly the Asian collapse in 1997 and 1998. There was surprisingly little talk of Japan's deepening banking crisis, and little noticeable pressure on Mr. Koizumi to fix the system after 10 years of decay. "We've got a lot of fatigue on that subject," one American official said. Even trade, the reason the group came into existence, seemed a passing thought.
Instead, terror dominated. Mr. Kasyanov, standing in for President Vladimir V. Putin, who stayed home to deal with the aftermath of the hostage crisis in Moscow, said world events compelled "the countries which were to some extent reluctant to join in this coalition to more actively participate in combating all signs of terrorism."
Mr. Bush also met with Indonesia's president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, aiming to stiffen her spine against militant Islamic forces in Indonesia. It took the bombing in Bali this month, which killed some 200 people, for her to acknowledge the force and depth of that militancy in predominantly Muslim Indonesia.

HEADLINE: What I Learned in Bosnia 

BYLINE:  By Paddy Ashdown; Paddy Ashdown is high representative of the international community for Bosnia and Herzegovina.

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina 

 BODY:
After a decade of engagement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United Nations mission is leaving at the end of this year. While the United Nations agencies will remain, the organization's responsibilities for policing will be taken over by the European Union.
 History will look back on our engagement in Bosnia and Herzegovina as the first faltering step toward a doctrine of international community. Bosnia will be seen as a new model for international intervention -- one designed not to pursue narrow national interests but to prevent conflict, to promote human rights and to rebuild war-torn societies. We are already applying the lessons of Bosnia in Kosovo, East Timor and Afghanistan. Perhaps they will be applied in Iraq as well. 
 That is not to say that we did not make mistakes. We did. But these mistakes can guide us toward an even more effective strategy as we help other countries move from authoritarianism to democracy, from war to peace. 
For example, in Bosnia we thought that democracy was the highest priority, and we measured it by the number of elections we could organize. The result seven years later is that the people of Bosnia have grown weary of voting. In addition, the focus on elections slowed our efforts to tackle organized crime and corruption, which have jeopardized quality of life and scared off foreign investment.
In hindsight, we should have put the establishment of the rule of law first, for everything else depends on it: a functioning economy, a free and fair political system, the development of civil society, public confidence in police and the courts. We would do well to reflect on this as we formulate our plans for Afghanistan and, perhaps, Iraq. 
Still, the United Nations role in Bosnia is one of the unsung success stories of the post-cold-war era. In 1996, after the establishment of the Dayton peace accords, the cynics said that refugees would never go home. Yet the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, working with other international agencies in Bosnia, has proved them wrong. More than a quarter of a million refugees -- in a country of only 3.7 million -- have returned to the homes they were driven from in terror.
The United Nations has also helped Bosnia establish a professional police service. In the early 1990's, the police in Bosnia were tools of terror, manipulated by the Bosnian, Serb and Croat war machines. Today, they work to prevent the sorts of crimes that trouble all societies. As the European Union takes on the police mission, it can do so confident that much of the preparatory work has been done. 
In fact, one of the most important lessons we can learn from Bosnia comes from the dignified and considered United Nations departure. Intervention is always easier than what comes after it: stabilizing a postwar society and ensuring that the problems that prompted the intervention in the first place do not return. The United Nations stayed to help Bosnia rebuild. Our success is a reminder that the real work doesn't end when the soldiers leave -- it's only just beginning.
The handover from the United Nations to the European Union marks a transition, not a withdrawal. The burden is, rightly and not before its time, being taken up by Europeans. Today, the European Union provides more than 9,000 troops, a market for Bosnian exports and tens of millions of Euros in annual assistance. 
This is a significant effort. It should not, however, obscure the fact that Bosnia cannot depend on Europe alone. While the American military presence has shrunk to slightly more than 2,000 troops, American political support and resources will remain crucial to the long-term success of the country's reconstruction. 
Some have said that Bosnia's most recent national elections, which took place on Oct. 5, set the country back -- that they were a vote for the nationalist parties who started the war and, as such, mark the failure of the international community's strategy in Bosnia. 
I disagree. The vote was a vote against the nonperformance of the nonnationalist governing parties, not a vote for nationalism. Two of the three nationalist parties actually saw their shares of the vote decline, and the party that made the greatest gains was a nonnationalist opposition party. 
We're not back in 1990. Next month it will be seven years since the Bosnian war ended. When the Dayton peace accords were signed, there were 430,000 people under arms; today there are 22,000. The foundation for a prosperous democracy is firmly in place. Now the challenge is to deliver effective government, stable institutions and honest leadership. 
There were many who believed the Dayton accords would fail. After all, the peace initiatives in the previous three and a half years of terrible conflict all unraveled. But peace, however fragile, has prevailed. Europe can begin its new role in Bosnia certain that the United Nations has done its job.

HEADLINE: A Voting Bloc Without a Party 

BYLINE:  By Tamar Jacoby; Tamar Jacoby is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki is not a flashy politician and his campaign this year is hardly high voltage, but he is working a quiet revolution among New York's Latino voters. One of the poorest communities in the state, they are traditionally one of the most left-leaning in the country. Yet a recent poll by The New York Times shows that among Hispanics the governor is in a statistical dead heat with his rival, H. Carl McCall, and insiders predict that he could win as much as 40 percent to 45 percent of the Latino vote. 
 In this instance as ever, most politics are local. Mr. Pataki has run a brilliant back-room campaign, using the power of his office to dole out benefits, like a raise for health-care workers, to traditional Democratic supporters. But the New York vote is not an anomaly. Politicians in state after state are finding that Latinos are not automatic Democrats. Like any neglected constituency, they appreciate being courted. And though they aren't entirely unmoored -- the majority still start with a preference for Democratic positions -- they are increasingly up for grabs politically. 
 In Texas, the Democratic establishment assumed Hispanics saw themselves as "minority voters." Party activists spent years recruiting Ron Kirk, who is black, and Tony Sanchez, a Hispanic businessman, to run for senator and governor, respectively. Together with the white candidate for lieutenant governor, they were labeled the Dream Team -- and assumed that their only real challenge would be turning out enough of the minority vote to trump Republicans' advantage among white Texans. 
But in Texas as in New York, Latinos don't automatically identify with black voters or support black candidates. In the Lone Star State, too, the two groups often compete for power in big cities. (Just last year, they went head to head in Houston, and Orlando Sanchez, the Republican mayoral candidate, nearly upset the black incumbent, Lee Brown.) Though Texas Hispanics have traditionally voted Democratic, a groundbreaking recent survey by the Pew Hispanic Center and the Kaiser Family Foundation found that only four in 10 now identify as Democrats, even less than the surprisingly low national figure for Latinos of 49 percent.
No wonder Democrats are growing pessimistic about a sweep by the Dream Team. Polls show black voters lining up behind Mr. Sanchez, but Latinos are lukewarm about Mr. Kirk: only about a third of them say they are planning to vote for him, and the Houston Hispanic Chamber of Commerce has endorsed his Republican rival. 
Things look a little better for the Democrats in California. The party could hardly have headed into the election with a bigger advantage. Few of the state's Latinos will ever forget the xenophobic TV ads Republicans ran in 1994 in support of Proposition 187, the statewide ballot initiative denying public schooling and other government services to illegal immigrants. Nor does it help that this year's Republican gubernatorial challenger, Bill Simon, has mounted one of the weakest statewide campaigns in the country.
But even in California a misstep by a Democrat can erode Latino loyalty -- as Gov. Gray Davis learned earlier this month when he vetoed a bill that would have allowed undocumented workers to apply for driver's licenses. The reaction from Hispanic elected officials was swift: the bill's sponsor excoriated the governor, and the state's Latino Legislative Caucus refused to endorse Mr. Davis. He is now trying to repair the damage, and he will still win a majority among Hispanic voters. But his margin -- and Latino turnout -- may be far from what he once counted on.
Poll after poll shows Hispanics dividing roughly into thirds when asked if they are liberal, conservative or middle of the road. Most look first to government to solve the problems of their community -- a fundamentally liberal inclination. They are more conservative than most Americans when it comes to social issues like abortion and homosexuality, but they invariably place more importance on bread-and-butter issues like education and the economy. And the Pew poll, like others before it, shows that partisan affiliation rarely runs deep.
Individual candidates consistently matter more to Latino voters than party labels. Republican mayors Rudolph W. Giuliani, Michael R. Bloomberg and, in Los Angeles, Richard J. Riordan have all won between 40 percent and 60 percent of the Latino vote, and even nationwide, where party labels count for much more, George W. Bush managed to carry 35 percent in 2002 (compared to only 9 percent of black voters). 
Nor are Hispanic voters strongly attracted to ideological identity politics. A recent survey by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, for example, found only one in 10 Latinos agreeing that literature aimed at getting out their vote should feature pictures of Latinos alone, while 84 percent preferred images of a mixed group of voters.
But perhaps as much as anything, Latino pragmatism shows itself in the way the community reacts to political appeals. One of the biggest reasons Latinos are so much in play this fall is that so many Republicans are wooing them -- campaigning in their neighborhoods, running targeted ads and simply paying them the respect of asking them directly for their votes. And if this year's candidates do well, others will follow.
The courtship by both parties can only intensify in coming elections. Democrats will try to hold Hispanic support by offering more services that appeal to working-class immigrants, like state-provided health insurance, college tuition subsidies and higher minimum-wage laws. And Republicans are sure to try -- and could succeed with -- platforms that stress new economic opportunity for students, first-time home-buyers and small businesses. Either way, Latino power will be a moderating influence as this bloc of voters judges candidates less on ideology than on what they actually deliver for the community.

Concrete Dreams: Actual Museums to Hold Virtual Art

BYLINE:  By Matthew Mirapaul; E-mail: mirapaul@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The United States is a curio cabinet of quirky museums. Among them are the Mount Horeb Mustard Museum in Wisconsin, the Children's Garbage Museum in Stratford, Conn., and the National Museum of Funeral History in Houston.
 But there's a gap. Despite the pride that Americans take in our technological prowess, this country -- unlike Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Japan -- does not yet have a major institution devoted to Internet-based art works and other forms of computer art. 
 Of course it's more than likely that a digital-arts center will eventually open. "Museums usually get started not just because there is a list of things that should happen, but because an individual with a particular passion makes it happen," said Marc Pachter, director of the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution. "So it's an accident that it hasn't started yet, but I think there will be one. It certainly makes sense that such a place would exist."
Efforts to establish a one-stop shop for the digital arts -- a Linkin' Center, if you will -- have been, at best, modestly successful. Donors are tight fisted, especially when there are no tangible objects that they can call their own. As a result, while there are small high-tech art centers scattered around the country and virtual museums sprinkled across the Web, none fulfill the museum functions of organizing, commissioning, exhibiting, collecting, preserving art works and education.
But two organizations are moving in the right direction. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Labs are working on a Center for Arts and Invention, to be housed in a new $120 million building on M.I.T.'s Cambridge campus that could open as early as 2005. Meanwhile Eyebeam, an independent high-tech arts center in New York City, was to announce today that the innovative digital-arts curator Benjamin Weil will take on the top curatorial role there on Nov. 1.
Officials at both institutions said their centers would be modeled less on a traditional museum than on the Bauhaus, the 20th-century German school that encouraged artists to integrate science into their creations. Officials also cautioned that their plans were in their early stages and that money to realize them has not been secured.
At M.I.T. the 197,000-square-foot center would be in a sleek seven-story structure designed by the Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki. It is to contain two rooftop theaters and an atrium for media-art exhibitions. The I. M. Pei-designed Media Labs building next door will be renovated, with the addition of an exhibition space and an experimental theater.
Nicholas Negroponte, chairman of the Media Labs, said the Center for Arts and Invention represented a new direction for his institution, which had urged its professors and students to think like artists in cultivating new technologies. "Today we are looking at the arts more in terms of learning and expression," he said. "We see ourselves as inventing the future, creating the bandwagons of tomorrow."
A big gulp. We shall see how it works soon. The center will begin accepting graduate students in September 2003, before the new building is done. Officials said they were discussing partnerships with two local groups that are developing their own high-tech homes: the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Constellation Performing Arts and Film Center in Cambridge.
Eyebeam plans to build a $90 million building in Chelsea and has hired the architects Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio to design it. John S. Johnson, Eyebeam's executive director, said he wanted to create "a new kind of institution that's part think tank, that's heavily involved in art production and that also happens to exhibit work." The building could be completed by 2006.
With the hiring of Mr. Weil, 39, it has also gained some needed curatorial expertise. The co-founder of ada'web, one of the first sites devoted to online-only art, Mr. Weil has been the curator of media arts at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where he will continue to consult. His plans for Eyebeam include commissioning new works, using its Internet site as an exhibition gallery and compiling an archive of digital pieces. ("Beta Launch," an exhibition of works by Eyebeam artists in residence, can be seen through Dec. 1 in its gallery at 540 West 21st Street.)
But not everyone is convinced that a digital-arts center or museum is such a nifty notion. Maxwell L. Anderson, the digitally adept director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, said that relentless advances in technology made it next to impossible to construct a structure that would accommodate all future possibilities. "It's such a slippery proposition to build bricks and mortar for bytes," he said.
Mr. Anderson also argued against separating digital art from more traditional forms for fear that its aesthetic value might be overshadowed by a focus on technological bells and whistles. "It's probably not the most fruitful thing to start segregating art-making practices by medium again," he said. "Ghettoizing would be the result. Instead, we want those artistic experiences to be seen in conjunction with others from the past because that's the best way to appreciate them."
Others assert that installing a digital art work in a marble-clad building would violate the spirit of a piece that was meant to be distributed over the Internet. Jon Ippolito, curator of new media at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, said that taking a train and standing in line to see digital art "would be a complete perversion of what this work is all about."
Laura McGough, who handles technology-oriented grant requests at the National Endowment for the Arts, said that the current decentralized system -- a cross-country network of universities, museums and regional high-tech arts centers -- was effectively providing digital artists with access to technology, commission dollars and exhibition space.
Of course the intangibility of many digital art works invites questions about whether they need to be enshrined in a physical space. In 1999 a group of institutions including the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Asia Society and the San Francisco Modern, discussed forming a venture called the Virtual Arts Network. It would have created an online-only site for exhibitions and performances. But the collapse of the dot-com economy doomed it.
Since then, more digital artists are creating works that blur the lines between the real and the virtual, and so it is reasonable to install them somewhere that draws visitors. 
Steve Dietz, the Walker's new-media curator, said that the digital arts would benefit from having museums devoted to them, much as the International Center of Photography helped establish photography as an art form. "There's a need for the energy and focus that an existing institution doing a digital-art show once a year can't provide," he said. "It needs more than that."
Mr. Dietz shares Mr. Anderson's concern that a digital-art museum might prevent the genre's acceptance by the broader art world. But he had a solution. Once the museum has developed an audience, he said, "maybe it should go out of business."

 CORRECTION:
The Arts Online column on Monday, about efforts to establish a major American museum devoted to Internet-based artworks and other computer art, misstated the role of Benjamin Weil at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. He remains curator of media arts; he is not just consulting.

What's on Tina Brown's Mind? British Are Finding Out

BYLINE:  By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
In her first outing as a columnist writing from New York for The Times of London, Tina Brown casually described Gerald M. Levin, the former chief executive of AOL Time Warner, as a "hamsterish figure," and disclosed that Robert Hughes, Time magazine's art critic and a disgruntled post-merger employee, had sent an e-mail message to Mr. Levin saying: "How can I convey to you the disgust which your name awakens in me?"
 In her second column, she described the "rapidly mounting narcoleptic desperation" she felt as she listened to the governor of New York, George E. Pataki, speak at a fund-raising breakfast. 
 And in her third, she revealed a certain graphically personal (and unprintable, at least in this space) detail from an interview the actress Lara Flynn Boyle gave to Talk, the magazine Ms. Brown edited until its spectacular demise last winter. It is no wonder that Ms. Brown, 48, sees her new weekly column -- a nervy compilation of acerbic observation and freewheeling cultural and anthropological commentary (as well as the short-term answer to the question: "What will Tina do next?") -- as a pleasantly liberating experience. 
"There is more opportunity to be a little more open, a little racier in the British press than it is here," she said in a recent telephone interview from New York. "It's really fun to be able to be myself and say, 'This is my voice, and this is how I see the world.' "
Britain has always had a complicated relationship with Ms. Brown, who made a name for herself here as a wickedly amusing writer before being appointed editor of Tatler, the society magazine. Colleagues left behind in London enviously gnashed their teeth as she reached the pinnacle of the shark-like Manhattan media scene, editing Vanity Fair, The New Yorker and finally the short-lived Talk.
On the one hand, the British chattering classes celebrate her success as an Englishwoman abroad; on the other, they watch hopefully for signs that she is losing her touch. As in New York, the news that Talk was folding precipitated a definite undercurrent of schadenfreude here. Her column is being picked over with the same vigilance, even by people who dismiss it as irrelevant.
"You know there's a problem when a columnist has to pause every few words to explain who the people she's being wittily bitchy about actually are," Amanda Platell, a former strategist for the Conservative Party, wrote in The New Statesman.
In an interview, John Graham, a former United States editor of The Financial Times, said that though he admired Ms. Brown's writing and viewpoint, her column had widely failed to impress, in part because it appeared in a tabloid section of The Times known as T2, among features and cultural news. "I love reading Tina Brown," he said, "but the serious columnists are all on the op-ed page."
Robert Thomson, the editor of The Times, said that on the contrary, the T2 section was a showcase for talent. "We have a collection of very good columnists," he said, "and we're not shy about putting them on Page 3 of a magazine that is read by around two million people every day." 
The column is going over very well in some circles in the United States, where it is available on the Web. 
"For the media class, the debut of Tina Brown's newspaper column was like the alarm clock ringing in the dream," William Powers wrote in The National Journal. "Exhausted by war, recession, and all the other grim story lines of the moment, we'd drifted off at our desks, cold to the world. Then along comes Tina, riffing in the clear, cold, vampish voice that is hers alone, and suddenly we're awake again, wiping the drool from our chins and, in spite of everything, smiling."
Ms. Brown says she does not know what she plans to do next, but according to her agent, Ed Victor, the offers are still coming thick and fast -- from Hollywood, television, online publications, magazines, newspapers and book publishers. She has been keeping a journal for years but has no plans to publish it, or a memoir based on it, anytime soon.
Until then, people like Steven T. Florio -- the president and chief executive at Conde Nast and the man with whom she was having lunch at the Four Seasons in Manhattan when Gerald Levin walked past, prompting the subsequent hamster comparison -- are hoping to stay on Ms. Brown's good side. (Through a spokesman, Mr. Levin declined to comment.)
"I had no idea she was doing anything until an e-mail came and said, 'You may be interested in the attached,' " Mr. Florio said in an interview. 'I'm enjoying it very much, although those people she's turned that razor-blade pen on do not feel the same way. I'm so glad that when I had lunch with her, I didn't say anything incriminating."

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook; 
Divas' Harlem Renaissance

BYLINE:  By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Dinah Washington, Bessie Smith, the Supremes, Billie Holiday and Tina Turner. All these women, great musical talents, have had their lives plumbed in works for the stage or the movies. Taking them in order, they are "Dinah Was," "The Devil's Music," "Dreamgirls," "Lady Sings the Blues" and "What's Love Got to Do With It?" What they have in common (aside from the obvious) is that the singing voices the shows celebrate are sources of empowerment for the women who own them. 
 They didn't all make effective use of the power, but their talent provided them with at least the opportunity to do battle with the sexist and racist cultural forces that have shaped the lives of so many black women in America. Shows about black divas proliferate not just because the music these women make is beloved, but because their talent has inevitably brought them into conflict with the status quo. "Liza!" or "Barbra!" just doesn't call up the same dramatic possibilities. 
 These stories are also rife with inspiration, particularly for black Americans, which makes it especially apt to find a sudden confluence of them in Harlem, a historical center of black culture, which is now emerging rather inspirationally from decades of deprivation. By coincidence, as it turns out, three small theaters are finding drama and deriving inspiration from the stories of black divas. 
O.K., it's a little early to start declaring a new theater district uptown. These are, after all, tiny-budget productions built more with big wishes and elbow grease than with other resources. But given the splash made by "Harlem Song" at the Apollo Theater (another show that points to black music as an elevating spirit and black musicians as representative figures), there is reason to celebrate and encourage the notion that black theater is living and breathing in the New York neighborhood where it most rightly belongs.
Of the three shows, the most polished -- if least adventurous -- is the Classical Theater of Harlem's production of August Wilson's 1984 play, "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," which continues through Sunday at the Harlem School of the Arts (645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street). No one can say this three-year-old troupe isn't big-thinking or diligent; its last production, "King Lear" with Paul Butler, was presented this summer in the Harlem school's courtyard except for the night I went to see it, when a cloudburst during Act I interrupted the performance. But no one left; the actors moved to an indoor lounge, the blocking was reinvented (I remember Goneril on the staircase landing at one point), and the show went estimably on.
No such improvisations were necessary for "Ma Rainey," although it is no walk in the park even in dry weather. It takes place in a seedy recording studio in Chicago in 1927 and requires well-oiled ensemble work, especially among the four members of Ma's backup band, whose casual interplay provides both tension and linguistic music. The play also calls for two charismatic lead performances. (Whoopi Goldberg is slated to take on the title role in a coming Broadway revival, with Charles S. Dutton as the hotheaded young trumpeter, Levee, a reprise of the role that lifted his career.)
It is directed here by Arthur French, who has tenaciously welded a cast of varied talents into a production that never lets go of its lucidity. He gets an effectively brassy performance from Tamela Aldridge as Ma, the great blues singer of the 1920's who wields her economic clout over her manager and a record company executive to fend off exploitation. And a couple of actors in smaller roles -- Roz Davis as Ma's sultry, easily distracted lesbian lover, Dussie Mae, and Ben Rivers as Sylvester, the stuttering nephew whom Ma insists on including in the recording session -- provide sharp, amusing caricatures.
Leopold Lowe gives Levee's cocky, take-on-the-world manner the fervid energy it needs. But this is the show's toughest, most subtly layered role, and he never finds a way to make us feel that from the start Levee is close to a breaking point. A result is that his violent explosion at the play's climax doesn't, in retrospect, feel inevitable. It merely seems a playwright's artifice, a strategy for concluding. Like Mr. Lowe, the production throughout achieves more through ardor than through subtlety. 
The other two shows are original works just getting up on rickety newborn legs. Through Nov. 24 at the St. Philip's Church Community Center (207 West 133rd Street), the Hadley Players are presenting "A Song for You: The Civil Rights Journey of a Negro Woman," a play written by Wendi Joy Franklin, who also stars as Lena Horne.
And the National Black Theater, at its Institute for Action Arts (Fifth Avenue between 125th and 126th Streets), is presenting "Marian Anderson: the Lady From Philadelphia," a biographical piece cobbled out of song, dance and Greek chorus. The production, by the American Jazz Theater, continues through Nov. 16. 
Both are too ambitious for the resources of their respective theaters, which are veteran organizations accustomed to struggling in a struggling community. And both could use extensive dramaturgical work. The storytelling is fitful, the narratives misshapen. These are serious caveats, but to my mind they are overshadowed by the grand ideas behind these two productions and the creative chutzpah involved in bringing them to life. 
The basement theater of the St. Philip's center and the temporary space that the National is using while its main auditorium is being renovated feel as hidden away as secret laboratories. And the shows, being produced with scissors and tape and Rube Goldberg ingenuity, are fearlessly self-possessed, brazen even, in their determination to represent, honor and celebrate the women who are their more than worthy subjects.
The first act of Ms. Franklin's tribute to Ms. Horne is an absorbing show all by itself. Set in the present at a youth conference in Atlanta, where Ms. Horne is getting an award, it consists largely of the honoree fielding questions from admirers who are played by actors sprinkled in the audience. 
The setup allows for Ms. Horne, now 85, to reflect on her early life -- divided between her grandmother's home in Brooklyn and an itinerant existence in the South. It also allows for a dispute to break out between two of her questioners on the issue of intraracial conflict raised by Ms. Horne's light skin and "keen" features, a surprising and very effective device that is beautifully carried out by the company's young supporting actors.
Ms. Horne's recollections are dramatized behind dark screens so they loom as memories, an odd strategy that plays less awkwardly than it sounds. And in this first act Ms. Franklin's rendering of her subject is uncanny; her speaking voice and demeanor are remarkably suggestive, and she even manages a likeness of Ms. Horne's stunning, high-cheekbone beauty. 
After intermission the show loses its grip a bit, as Ms. Horne's show business career is summarized in brief scenes with unwieldy pauses for Ms. Franklin to change costumes between each one (the show provides a retrospective on the 20th-century hairdo) and a sense of repetition as she stands up to racism again and again. By the end you're also hungry for a little more music; Ms. Franklin does sing Ms. Horne's signature tune, "Stormy Weather," along with a couple of others, but her voice is not her strong suit.
The reverse is true in "The Lady From Philadelphia." As Marian Anderson, Quanda Johnson gives the best musical performance of the three starring actresses; she has a bell-clear voice and does a nice job of rendering Anderson's poised elegance. 
The show itself, however, is beleaguered. Written by Walter Jones, Edgar Nkosi White and Norma Jean Darden and directed and choreographed by Raquelle Chavis, it tells of Anderson's rise to opera star and black heroine. (She was the Metropolitan Opera's Jackie Robinson.) It badly needs a dramaturge (among other things, the chorus is saddled with some sophomoric incantations) and the youthful supporting players were obviously cast for their dancing, not their acting. There is a community-pageant quality to the presentation. 
Still, the show's concept is both intriguing and wise. It is the creators' intention to tell Anderson's unlikely story as a modern ballet with song and spoken word, an idea that is apt and provocative. With intermittent nuggets of theatrical accomplishment, the show proves there is excitement to be mined. And what a subject. 
It is a small stretch to conceive of a like project reimagined in a Broadway setting, with great music, larger-than-life characters including Paul Robeson and Sol Hurok, titillating personal tales (Anderson's fending off Robeson's advances, for example) and some irresistibly potent emotion. 
It was in 1939 that Anderson was denied the opportunity to sing at Constitution Hall in Washington, banned by the hall's owners, the Daughters of the American Revolution. The incident caused Eleanor Roosevelt to resign from the D.A.R. and led Anderson's performing instead on the steps of at the Lincoln Memorial. Can you imagine "My country 'tis of thee" as an 11 o'clock number? 
Paging Audra McDonald!

HEADLINE: The Angry Appeal of Eminem Is Cutting Across Racial Lines 

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
The Bronx River Houses are hallowed ground in the hip-hop world, one of the neighborhoods where young African-Americans and Hispanics helped create a new art form in the 1970's. The housing project in the South Bronx takes its heritage seriously. From there emerged a founder of hip-hop, Afrika Bambaataa, and the loose-knit group of D.J.'s, dancers, graffiti artists and rappers called Zulu Nation.
 Three decades later, the No. 1 selling rapper in the country is a 30-year-old white man, Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III. Only three years ago, he was derided as "the Elvis of hip-hop," or a raw version of the 1980's flattopped performer Vanilla Ice (no comparison could be worse on these streets). But these days at "the Bricks," as the Bronx River Houses are called, there is no resentment, there are no complaints about Eminem's racial identity. 
 Not only is Eminem accepted as a supremely skillful practitioner of rap, many say he is the salvation of an art form that they say has been corrupted by a focus on Bentleys, yachts and Cristal Champagne. 
"You don't see him wearing thousand-pound gold chains encrusted with ice," Manaury Reyes, 17, said of Eminem. "He's always dressed regular in sweats like us. The sweats might cost more, but he ain't frontin'. He's not rapping about clothes, cars and jewelry like all those other rappers. He's rapping about life -- you know, stuff that we go through out here. Some of it's a goof, but some of it's real, and it sounds like it comes from the heart, you know. A lot of us can relate to that."
This is the kind of loyalty that executives at Universal Pictures, which is owned by Vivendi Universal, are counting on when "8 Mile," starring Eminem, is released on Nov. 8. The film, loosely based on Eminem's life, is the latest test of the rapper's crossover appeal. The film's title refers to the rough-and-tumble neighborhood that is Detroit's racial and economic divide.
While it is well known among music industry executives that hip-hop consumers are more than 75 percent nonblack (Eminem's core audience is suburban white teenagers), Universal Pictures will need to reach into minority audiences to make "8 Mile" a hit.
Hip-hop artists are a proven box-office draw. "Barbershop," an urban comedy starring Ice Cube, grossed an estimated $69.5 million by Saturday since its release on Sept. 13. "Brown Sugar," a hip-hop love story starring Taye Diggs, grossed $22.4 million since its release on Oct. 11. Last year, "Exit Wounds," starring DMX, grossed $52 million. The main artists in these movies have been black. But no one expects Eminem's race will keep blacks and Hispanics from going to the box office.
"Eminem gets a pass in the same vein that back during segregation black folks had to be better than average, had to be the best, to be accepted," said Stephen Hill, vice president for music and talent at Black Entertainment Television. "Eminem is better than the best. In his own way, he is the best lyricist, alliterator and enunciator out there in hip-hop music. In terms of rapping about the pain that other disenfranchised people feel, there is no one better at their game than Eminem."
There are some skeptics. Star, a host of an often raunchy, racially frank radio program, "Star and Buc Wild Morning Show" on WQHT-FM in New York, said that Eminem may be the world's best rapper, but that he benefits from institutional racism.
"Big deals aren't given to the black producers or artists," he said. "They are given to the white kids, the people that the executives feel comfortable with."
In the end, even skeptics give Eminem credit. Star pointed out that Eminem has earned credibility in the black community because he does not run from the "Elvis thing."
Eminem jokes about it. On the track, "White America," on the album, "The Eminem Show," he says, "Let's do the math -- if I was black, I would've sold half," he said explaining why a white rapper sells more albums than black rappers.
And he does sell albums. He is one of the few bright spots in a music industry suffering from declining CD sales. His latest album, "The Eminem Show," has sold 6.7 million copies domestically, more than any other rapper has in any one year, according to Nielsen SoundScan, which has been tracking such sales since 1991.
This year, Eminem has outsold some of the most popular hip-hop artists, all of them black. Nelly has sold 4.2 million copies; Ludacris, 2 million; and Ja Rule, 1.6 million, according to Nielsen SoundScan.
The strategic early release of "Lose Yourself," a single from the "8 Mile" soundtrack, has not hurt. It was No. 2 last week in Billboard's Top 10 singles charts.
On a windswept basketball court at the cluster of neatly kept brown-brick projects at 174th Street and Stratford Avenue, teenagers gave Eminem credit for "keeping it real." They see him both as a rebel rising up against a brutal parent and as the devoted father they never had. Throughout his album, "The Eminem Show," he pledges to his daughter, Hailie Jade, 6, everlasting love and support.
The album boldly recounts the rapper's depressing childhood, though it is difficult to tell fact from fiction. He raps about his hatred of his mother, Debbie Mathers-Briggs (whom he says was a drug addict and who unsuccessfully sued him for slander), his ex-wife Kim Mathers, and the news media.
To the teenagers at the Bricks, Eminem's life, as he tells it, was harsher than their own -- that which they cared to reveal. Many grew up in homes supported by single mothers. They say it is unfathomable that a mother would treat a child anything like Eminem describes in his song, "Cleanin' Out My Closet."
In the song, he asks his mother, "Remember when Ronnie died, and you wished it was me?" (Ronnie Polkingharn was an uncle who committed suicide.) Then, he continues, with words aimed to strike at any mother's heart: "Hailie's getting so big now. You should see her, she's beautiful. But you'll never see her. She won't even be at your funeral."
Andre Hannah, 14, said: "My dads is gone. It would be cool if my dad was there for me like he's there for his daughter. I mean, he loves her more than he loves his wife and mother."
Teenagers love that Eminem challenges elected officials, whose attacks on the singer only cement their loyalty to him. Last summer, he named his concert tour, the Anger Management Tour. It mockingly featured sound bites from Congressional hearings and newscasts describing him as vulgar, degenerate, homophobic, antisocial, misogynistic and "noise and mind pollution." He did not disagree.
Teenagers appreciate Eminem's respect for his producer and mentor, Dr. Dre, who is black and helped give him credibility in the hip-hop world.
"When I first saw Eminem, I thought he wasn't going to last," said Charles Rosario, 15, a student at Christopher Columbus High School in the South Bronx. "I thought he was going to be another phony like Vanilla Ice.
"He came out with that song, 'My Name Is,' " he said. "I was like, 'Oh, man. Who is this fake?' But Dr. Dre gave it some nice beats and stuff."
Jose Gallardeo, 16, a student at James Monroe High School in the South Bronx, says that Eminem's revenge fantasies, which have included raping his mother and killing his ex-wife, give him an edge over other rappers.
"It's the kind of music that makes you stop and say, 'Is this dude for real?' " he said. "He's not like everybody else."
Mike Brisbain, 18, who lives in the Bronx River Houses, is unimpressed: "He needs to calm down with all that crazy white-boy stuff -- that fight music, yo. That's gonna get him hurt. He's a good lyricist. He should concentrate on that."
Davon Pleasant, 15, a student at Lewis and Clark High School, was the lone detractor. He prefers DMX, the raspy-voiced hardcore rapper from Yonkers.
"I don't like him," he said of Eminem. "He talks about killing his wife in his songs. I don't care what she did to him. That's wrong."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE ALLIES; 
Turkey, in the Middle, Grows More Worried Every Day About a U.S. Attack on Iraq

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
Barely a day goes by without Turkey's prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, saying just how little he wants a war with his neighbor Iraq. He complains about being "caught in the middle." He bluntly raises Turkey's importance to the United States, on the map and as the only Muslim country in NATO. 
 "We know that the United States cannot carry out this operation without us," he said last week. "That is why we are advising that it abandon the idea. We're telling Washington that we are worried about the matter." 
 In the end, there seems little doubt that Turkey, however reluctantly, would side with its big friend and patron. But months into the American drive for support against Iraq, Turkey's leaders are still withholding their wholehearted support, and their discomfort grows daily.
So unanimous are Turks against a war in Iraq that it has hardly been raised in the campaign for parliamentary elections on Nov. 3. The election looks certain to expel the coalition led by Mr. Ecevit in favor of an untried party with roots in political Islam, which worries many here as a threat to Turkey's secularism. 
Still, even the leaders of that party, Justice and Development, repeat the same conflicted refrain: Yes, Saddam Hussein is a menace. Turkey, they say, will probably support the United States in the name of its long and broad friendship, as well as its own strategic interests. 
But Turkey, concerned that war could worsen an already dire economy and inflict new problems of refugees and Kurdish separatism, is not eager to play the role Pakistan did in the war in Afghanistan. 
"It is in the nature of Turks to be convinced easily but react when they realize that they have been cheated," warned Abdullah Gul, a top Justice and Development leader who is in the mix to become Turkey's next prime minister. "Therefore, Turkey should be listened to and understood over her interests and concerns." 
So the real issue is not whether Turkey will ultimately go along in an operation against Iraq, say Turkish officials, analysts and diplomats. Rather it is salving the nation's worries to prevent any long-term damage to relations between the United States and Turkey, the kind of moderate Muslim country Washington would like to encourage.
"Both nations will take extreme care not to have an open conflict over what happens in Iraq," said Ilter Turan, a political science professor and a former rector at Istanbul Bilgi University. "But if the United States intervenes and if you have a prolonged struggle, a prolonged military role in Iraq, probably quite a number of problems might crop up." 
The election has injected a further note of uncertainty in the form of the Justice and Development Party, which is currently drawing as much as 30 percent in the polls. The question mark is whether its leaders, though they have disavowed political Islam, will be any less of an ally to the United States, particularly on the question of Iraq. 
Mr. Gul and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the party's popular leader, who have played down their pasts as Islamic activists, say the relationship would likely stay the same, and Mr. Gul has been quoted as saying that they would leave any decision on Iraq to Turkey's military. Most experts say they would have no choice, at least in the short term; in 1997, the military eased out the last Islamic-leaning party to govern Turkey. 
Zeyno Baran, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said it was highly unlikely they would change the alliance with the United States. "Absolutely not," she said. "Because this will be the grounds for the military removing them." 
With elections a week away, Turkish and American officials are reportedly deep in negotiations about an assault on Iraq and how the United States would safeguard Turkey's concerns. Last week, Gen. Tommy R. Franks, head of the United States Central Command, and Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, supreme allied commander in Europe, visited Turkey for talks with its top commanders. On Wednesday, President Bush called President Ahmet Necdet Sezer for a discussion the White House said covered the "United States-Turkey strategic partnership."
Officials from both nations say there has been no formal request, like a role for Turkish troops in a ground operation in Iraq or the use of air bases here, seen as indispensable for American bombing runs on Iraq. Several reports suggest that any plan might include having Turkey send thousands of troops into northern Iraq -- in addition to the 2,000 to 5,000 already there chasing Kurdish rebels -- to stem the flow of refugees or defeated Iraqi fighters. 
Turkey, though, is decidedly wary, and officials say Washington is frustrated that it has withheld firmer support, partly out of worry that Mr. Hussein will take full advantage of disunity in the region. 
But Turkey's own worries stretch back over a decade, to the last time it was asked to help in an attack on Iraq. Turkish officials complain that Operation Desert Storm cost tens of billions in dollars, in military expenses, trade with Iraq and lost revenue from tourism. The no-flight zone enforced since then over northern Iraq also led to what they believe is something close to an independent Kurdish state there, a longstanding worry for Turkey, with its own restive Kurdish population.
Government officials here complain loudly that they do not fully trust American assurances that there will be no actual Kurdish state and have even threatened to take Iraqi territory if Kurds seize the oil city of Kirkuk, which Turkey says is populated mostly by ethnic Turkmen. 
But many experts say there is a greater worry about a new war: money. Turkey remains in a deep economic crisis, eased only recently and with pain through a new program with the International Monetary Fund. Many Turks see their real interest not in war with Iraq, but in talks to join the European Union, which this month spurned Turkey once again by not setting a firm date for talks on joining the organization. 
If the United States wants Turkey's support, many here say, it must be sure Turkey does not lose again, and reportedly a financial package worth roughly $5 billion is being discussed. Some experts suggest that it would also help if the United States pushed the European Union to set a date for entrance talks at a meeting of ministers of the European Union in December. Iraq may, otherwise, remain a hard sell here. 
"The country is already in trouble, and an external crisis is all we need," said Ahmet Atici, 37, who sat reading a book in his empty shoe store at an upscale mall in Ankara, the capital. "We have no customers. We close down with pitiful figures every night. So we should only be concerned about our own national interests."

HEADLINE: A Shot at Celluloid Immortality for Doomed Houses 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: SAN RAFAEL, Calif., Oct. 23 

 BODY:
They read like real estate advertisements, complete with detailed property descriptions and color photographs depicting spacious bedrooms, grand staircases and lush gardens.
 "Backyard. Pool house. Historic neighborhood. Garage: Three plus." 
 In reality, the listings by the California Film Commission are more like death notices. Many of the properties lie in the path of planned freeway expansions and have been wrenched from angry and tearful families. Vacant and sometimes boarded shut, they are destined for the wrecking ball. 
But not before they get one final moment of celluloid fame.
Faced with a sour economy and runaway productions, officials are offering up ill-fated houses, office buildings and factories -- even an abandoned mental hospital near Los Angeles -- to keep Hollywood from forsaking California for Canada and beyond. 
The structures are culled from mostly forgotten-property inventories kept by state agencies and then offered free to production companies that shoot movies, television shows, music videos and advertisements. Here today and gone tomorrow, the giveaways save filmmakers money while feeding their hunger for something different and exclusive.
"Everyone wants 'unshot' locations, because people don't like to see their sets appear in other films, certainly not on television," said Bill Bowling, a supervising location manager for "Red Dragon," a recent movie by Universal Pictures that used one of the properties, an empty office building in downtown Los Angeles.
"So many locations are used," Mr. Bowling said. "It is a very serious challenge to find a unique one. This building was just a godsend for us."
The program is an outgrowth of the desire to coddle a homegrown industry that is being lured away with big financial incentives. Since last year, the State Film Commission has also begun refunding some location fees and other costs when films are shot on public property like schools and parks. The reason is simple. The Motion Picture Association of America estimates the industry adds more than $32 billion a year to the state's economy. No one here wants to see that money go elsewhere.
"A few years ago, at the top of the dot-com boom, San Francisco and other places in California got full of themselves, and it became very expensive to film," said Paul Barnett, producer of an independent movie being filmed in San Rafael, a suburb of San Francisco, in a house provided by the state. "Now the state is saying: 'We are sorry. We shafted you. Please come back.' "
In the case of "Kill Bill," a Quentin Tarantino movie in production for Miramax Film, the property program and location refunds were enough to prompt a script revision. Scenes written for Texas were changed to California, according to Douglas Dresser, the location manager. The movie, which also films in China, Japan and Mexico, uses a boarded-up house near Alhambra in Los Angeles County that is supposed to be torn down for a freeway.
Jeff Morales, director of the State Transportation Department, which owns most of the available properties, said his agency compiled the inventory after Gov. Gray Davis had instructed state agencies to find ways to encourage local filming.
In the past, the Transportation Department issued permits for episodes like highway chase scenes, but had little other contact with the film industry, Mr. Morales said. Now in addition to offering a rolling directory of condemned houses, officials post road work schedules on the department Web site, www.dot.ca.gov/, to make it easier for filmmakers to use freeways closed to traffic. 
The surplus-property program, the State Theatrical Resources Partnership, started last fall in Southern California. This month, it expanded to include 10 properties in the Bay Area. Among those sites are eight houses here that are to be knocked down next year for a car pool lane on the 101 freeway. 
Karen Constine, director of the film commission, said 83 productions had used the free locations over the last 12 months for a total of 300 days of filming. Although those numbers account for a small fraction of film production in the state, she said, the program is still in its infancy. "The only complaint so far is that people want more," Ms. Constine said.
Mr. Bowling of "Red Dragon" said his crews used the state office building in Los Angeles for six weeks, shooting scenes meant to be the offices of the F.B.I., the Atlanta police and a municipal hospital. The film used metal desks and filing cabinets left in the 10-story building. Unlike the case at most locations, where everything has to return to original condition, there was no pressure to fill holes and paint walls after filming.
"Since the building is coming down anyway, we were able to do a lot of things that we would never be able to do with other buildings," said Mr. Bowling, who estimated that the property and refund programs had saved the production $200,000.
In San Rafael, Mr. Barnett has used several houses on Brookdale Avenue for his film "Happily, Even After." Scenes were shot in a pretty Victorian with stained-glass windows and a friendly front porch. The bungalow next door doubled as a wardrobe room and catering hall.
In all, Mr. Barnett estimates, the projected $1 million production saved $70,000. "We are very happy," he said.
The filming also brought some cheer to a neighborhood that has known little of it in recent years. Sharon Deen-Darman, who for 18 years lived in the pretty Victorian, attended countless neighborhood meetings to fight the new car pool lane. When the battle was lost, Ms. Deen-Darman considered moving the house, but it was too expensive. Last November, with tears in her eyes, she accepted a check for $649,000 and left.
Then, last week, Ms. Deen-Darman got a call from an excited former neighbor about film crews outside her old house. Ms. Deen-Darman was making last-minute preparations to be married. On the day of her rehearsal dinner, she took the wedding party for a spin down Brookdale Avenue. 
"I rolled my window down and said, 'This used to be my house,' " Ms. Deen-Darman said. "There were film people there. They said, 'Come on in.' "
She shed more tears, especially when she saw that the garden flowers were dead and that some kitchen cabinets had been ripped down. The place was a mess, but that was what the script called for. Ms. Deen-Darman's mother took photographs and told the crew that her daughter would never have let the house fall into that condition.
Ms. Deen-Darman said she considers "Happily, Even After" a wonderful wedding gift.
"I am thrilled they are making a movie there," she said. "It was a very happy home. I have happy feelings again."

HEADLINE: Pacific Summitry in an Age of Peril: The U.S. Is Mr. Big 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
They want their economic borders to be more open. They want their actual borders to be more secure. They want to keep out terrorists, guns and bombs. They want to speed in tourists, trade and data.
 The 21 nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation today ended a summit meeting of world leaders with formal statements that showed how much the United States's campaign against terrorism is influencing the global agenda. The nations, including the United States, China, Russia, Indonesia and Japan, hold nearly half the world's people and control more than half its trade. 
 The strengths of American power were clear in a series of promises and proposals to make most of the rest of the world as secure from hijackers and bombers as the United States is trying to be.
The United States drafted and the conference adopted measures to heighten the security of millions of shipping containers, bolster the cockpit doors of international passenger and cargo airliners, and strengthen customs and border posts.
The United States also pushed for, and won, the first multinational agreement aimed at monitoring charities and money-transfer offices suspected of financing terrorist organizations. "We will jointly work to deny terrorists access to the world's financial system and use the money trail to locate and apprehend terrorists," the conference's final declaration said.
The declaration acknowledges that terrorism threatens "free, open and prosperous economies," as well as "international peace, security and economic sustainability."
None of this would have been written before Sept. 11, 2001. It escaped the attention of no member of this group devoted to world trade that the main target that day was the World Trade Center. Few failed to feel the secondary economic shock waves of the attack. And few fail to acknowledge the American imperative against terrorism, or its warning that no nation is safe from the threat.
But weaknesses in the American agenda against the "axis of evil" also showed.
President Bush persuaded no nation to condemn North Korea or use economic sanctions to coerce it into abandoning its nuclear-weapons program. He won no new support for his proposed United Nations resolution on Iraq.
The conference's main declaration mentioned neither Iraq nor North Korea as a specific problem. In a separate text, the leaders agreed merely on telling North Korea to "give up nuclear weapons programs." They made no formal statement of any kind about Iraq.
The conference called for the abolition of agricultural subsidies, which protect American farmers from market forces but hurt peasants in places like Mexico.
In the end, some of the Asian and Pacific nations -- like Indonesia, the site of a bombing this month that took roughly 200 lives, and the Philippines, also hit by terrorist attacks -- remained as concerned with the economic causes of terrorism as with its economic consequences.
The leaders of those and other developing nations at the conference suggested that poverty remained a root cause of political violence, and that rich nations owed it to themselves and others to address it.
"The war against terrorism is going to be long, difficult and borderless," said the president of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. "Security impedes prosperity, but at the same time, poverty feeds extremists."
That concern about poverty as a source of terrorism moves few in the White House, though some members of the administration, notably Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, have acknowledged it as legitimate.
The Bush administration realized after the Sept. 11 attacks that South and East Asia would be major fronts in its campaign against terrorism. They saw, as one intelligence official put it a year ago, "a concerted effort by bin Laden and his people to expand their activities" in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, and began mobilizing against it.
Many of the administration's efforts at this conference arose from that mobilization. As Rodolfo Severino, secretary general of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said, the economic outlook for those nations does not now hinge on trade agreements or tourism campaigns.
Rather, he said, it "depends on what the terrorists do next."

HEADLINE: Pataki Accents Economic Accomplishments on Whistle-Stop Campaign 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, N.Y., Oct. 27 

 BODY:
Riding a wave of newspaper endorsements, Gov. George E. Pataki took an old-fashioned whistle-stop train trip from Binghamton to this city today and trumpeted his campaign themes from the back of a luxury car once used by President Harry S. Truman.
 It was a day of campaign hoopla, Dixieland music, bunting and bobbing blue Pataki signs. Loyal Republicans cheered Mr. Pataki and the rest of the Republican ticket as they delivered rosy speeches, short on substance, and predicted victory on Nov. 5. In New York City, meanwhile, Mr. Pataki's two major opponents debated without him, though he was the focus of their scathing remarks. 
 The train was chartered by the Pataki campaign from the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway and called the Pataki Express. It began its journey at 2:15 p.m. after Mr. Pataki addressed about 200 people, many of them from local Republican clubs. He gave his standard stump speech, touting his efforts to cut taxes, create jobs and move people off the welfare rolls.
"We are going to have another victory," the governor said. "Not just so I can say that I won a third term, but so we can continue the policies that made us a better, stronger state."
The staggering economy is the biggest issue in the counties Mr. Pataki crossed today -- Broome, Cortland and Onondaga -- as the state has struggled to keep manufacturers from pulling up stakes and leaving. Broome County, for instance, has lost about 3,000 jobs in the last two years, though it still has about 4,000 more jobs than it did when Mr. Pataki came into office in 1995.
"There is nothing you can do about it," said Samuel N. Rowe Jr., the Republican supervisor of the town of Hancock, who came out to cheer Mr. Pataki. A medical supply company in his town just announced it was moving to Puerto Rico with 120 jobs. "You can't blame the governor for that."
Mr. Pataki's main opponents, however, have tried to hold the governor responsible. Tom Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, has flooded the airwaves with ads attacking Mr. Pataki's handling of the economy. And the Democratic challenger, H. Carl McCall, has accused the governor of failing to attract businesses to upstate New York.
Rocking along under gray skies, Mr. Pataki's train made two stops. In Cortland, he addressed a small but boisterous crowd of about 150 people, pointing out that neither of his opponents had visited the town during this election year. About 200 people were waiting at a train station in Syracuse, with loudspeakers blaring the governor's adopted rock anthem, "New York Groove," by Ace Frehley.
About a dozen of the people in the crowd attended all three events, chasing the train up the Chenango and Tioughnioga Rivers in cars. Some were state employees. "Those would be some of our more enthusiastic supporters," one Pataki aide said. 
The car used by the governor was built in 1927 and used by President Truman in 1952 for a campaign trip from Salt Lake City to Denver on behalf of the Democratic candidate, Adlai E. Stevenson.
John J. Faso, the former Republican assemblyman who is running for comptroller, and Dora L. Irizarry, a judge who is running on the Republican line for attorney general, were on board for the 78-mile whistle-stop campaign. So was Lt. Gov. Mary O. Donohue.
Speaking to reporters on the train, Mr. Pataki defended his constant travel around the state during his two terms in office. His critics in the Legislature have said he attends too many ribbon cuttings and announcements instead of working in the Capitol on legislation and the budget.
"When you are out there listening and hearing their concerns, I sincerely believe that it helps you govern better," Mr. Pataki said.
At each stop, Mr. Pataki stressed the local economic development grants his administration has given. But each town on the itinerary today has suffered terrible economic setbacks over the last two years. Universal Instruments, a manufacturer of electronic equipment, has laid off more than 700 people in Binghamton over the last two years. 
Yet many of the Republican stalwarts and others who came out to see the governor today did not blame him for their economic plight.
"He's been doing his damnedest to bring business back here," said Melchiore Curatolo, a 75-year-old retiree from a defunct Binghamton company. "But what's he going to do? You can't control business."

HEADLINE: Olympic Winner to Face Stiff Fight 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 BODY:
While New York and San Francisco are competing to be the United States candidate for host city of the 2012 Olympics, those looking past their duel point out that the competition at the international level is much tougher.
 Despite a global economic downturn, many major cities in other nations are also planning bids to hold the 2012 Summer Olympics. Moscow, Istanbul and Havana have already announced intentions to join the race. Either Madrid or Seville will bid from Spain, as will a German city to be determined from among five candidates early next year. Other strong possibilities include Paris, Budapest and Rome. Furthermore, London, Rio de Janeiro and Toronto are less likely but still conceivable. 
 The cities will compete to be chosen in 2005 by the International Olympic Committee as the site for the 2012 Summer Games.
"We are expecting 10 or 11 countries," Jacques Rogge, the International Olympic Committee president, said in a telephone interview from Lausanne, Switzerland.
This could be one of the most competitive Olympic bidding processes in history, and Mr. Rogge said he believed the bids' merits, and not any factor like sympathy for New York because of the Sept. 11 attack, should be decisive.
"I think that New Yorkers themselves will want to win on their own merits and the quality of their bid," Mr. Rogge said. "Of course the whole world has mourned what happened. It was a tragic event, and there is always an emotional link.
"But we are speaking about a sports competition organized for the best athletes in the world, and the organization should be judged on the quality of the bid, and not on legitimate emotional issues."
A Hungarian official, Gabor Seprenyi, the head of the research department at the Hungarian Ministry of Sport, which has been developing Budapest's bid, conceded there could be such an impact.
"It probably could be an advantage," he said. "The majority of the whole world feels a great sympathy for New York City, the symbol of this great disaster which happened last year. So it's the emotional side, and it could be part of the decision-making process. But on the other hand, you have to convince the members of the I.O.C. who vote, not the press or the public. That is your target group, and it is a difficult group to read."
What is clear is that the contenders feel a strong desire to win in 2005.
"We all feel a sense of solidarity because of what happened in New York," said Felicio Mayoral, director general of Madrid's 2012 bid. "But this is a sports competition, and we definitely feel we have the right to present ourselves."
A big question for those schooled in Olympic geopolitics is this: Would there be any sense for New York or San Francisco to present itself at all if Vancouver were to be named host of the 2010 Winter Olympics at next year's I.O.C. session in Prague? The only two other cities in contention to hold those winter games are picturesque Salzburg, Austria, and Pyeongchang, South Korea.
Some who have tried to handicap the various cities' prospects say that if Vancouver, whose early reviews are strong, did win, it would seem unlikely that the I.O.C. would give North America two Olympic games in a row. 
"It's like the monster of Loch Ness," Mr. Rogge said of this theory. "You hear about it; you never see it. If you look at recent developments, we had Athens and Torino in a row in 2004 and 2006 in Europe. So that's the best sign that nothing is really fixed, and that you can't say geographical rotation is the rule. When we went from one continent to another, it was because of the higher quality of one bid compared to the others."
There is nothing in the Olympic charter that obligates the committee to rotate the Olympics from continent to continent.
The I.O.C. also granted the 1992 Summer Games to Barcelona and the 1992 Winter Games to another European city: Albertville, France. But despite Mr. Rogge's comments, that is still an exception to the historical trend over the last 50 years.
One I.O.C. member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that there was lingering resentment among some members about the Canadian delegation's behavior in Salt Lake City, when it lobbied vigorously and successfully for a duplicate gold medal to be awarded to its pairs skaters, Jamie Sale and David Pelletier, after evidence of corrupt judging surfaced.
"Some people have a score to settle with the Canadians," the member said. "I don't know how many there are, but there are some. I think you're jumping the gun to say Vancouver will win, and I think you're jumping the gun to say that if Vancouver does win, it's the end of New York. Many things could happen."
The same member suggested that one twist could be a groundswell of support for a possible Brazilian bid. No South American nation has been host of the Olympics, and Rio de Janeiro has already been awarded the 2007 Pan American Games. "Everyone might be happy to try to help solve some of South America's problems by going to Rio in 2012," the member said.
Mr. Rogge did not agree with the idea that a North American city like New York would encounter fewer problems by waiting until 2016 to bid. "I think your country can capitalize on the momentum of very, very successful Salt Lake City Games, and on the success of both your summer and winter teams at the Games," he said. "I think from a timing point of view, there is absolutely no reason to wait."

HEADLINE: Eat, Drink and Bid: Wine Auction Finds a Menu for Success 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG

 BODY:
Zachys re-entered New York's wine auction arena over the weekend in an inaugural sale whose form, longtime collectors said, could reshape America's commercial wine auctions. 
 The sale, on Friday and Saturday at the celebrated Restaurant Daniel in Manhattan, featured haute cuisine taken with glasses of Champagne, Burgundy and Bordeaux to a white-tablecloth auction floor for the first time at such an auction, they said. 
 The buffet created entertaining lunch theater, a charity-auction practice that unzips thick wallets, especially in California. "I've never seen this before," said John D. Ritchie, a Portland, Ore., collector. 
After Zachys, a large-scale Scarsdale, N.Y., emporium, and Christie's in Manhattan ended a seven-year partnership in December, Zachys decided to go it alone. The house sold 1,510 of 1,568 lots of fine and rare wines, or 96.3 percent. Strong across-the-board prices totaled $3,647,075 (including the 16 percent buyers' premium), exceeding the presale high estimate of $3,643,950. 
Jeff Zacharia, president of Zachys, said yesterday, "I would guess that 15 to 20 percent of the buyers were first-time buyers at auction, which is significant." Americans bought 6 of the top 10 revenue-producing lots.
The high-powered spiel of Ursula Hermacinski and cheerful wit of Fritz Hatton, whom high rollers consider the nation's premiere wine auctioneers, punctuated the bidding with irreverent remarks that ignited bursts of laughter.
One guest, Richard Brierley, who heads Christie's wine department, said the auction was "something of a spectacle -- very fun, a relaxed atmosphere." He added: "Obviously it's a great success. Will it be sustainable? It's a crowded marketplace out there." His question may be answered Dec. 6-7, when Zachys holds its next auction.
In New York, which has displaced London as the wine auction capital, five houses now compete internationally for cellars and buyers. With absentee bidders' purchases strong and the economy weak, auction floors can be sleepy. Daniel's dining room, with merchants' agents and sommeliers seeking good buys, ranged from perhaps 40 to 80 percent full.
Charles Klatskin, a prominent New Jersey collector, said, "The most important thing here is the provenance" -- the sources of the lots and established history and soundness of storage conditions. 
Zachys amassed pristine lots from the cellars of Mahler-Besse, a major Bordeaux merchant; Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou, a Second Growth in Bordeaux; and the owners of Scandia, a once celebrated but long-closed Los Angeles restaurant. 
The top earner, a case of 1945 Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, a red Bordeaux estimated at $75,000, fetched $87,000 from an American buyer. Six magnums of 1990 Romane-Conti from Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, red Burgundy estimated at $65,000, brought $69,600. Twelve bottles of 1982 Chateau Petrus, a blue-chip Pomerol, estimated at $22,000, earned $25,520. 
More moderately, three lots of 1982 Chateau Clerc-Milon, with $600 high estimates, each fetched $464.

HEADLINE: Burden Grows On Services For Teenagers 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
Recent changes in state law are expected to double the number of parents requesting government help with their runaway, truant or delinquent teenagers, straining child welfare services at a time of budget cuts.
 The potential flood of children 16 to 18 years old -- often the toughest teenagers to reach -- could cause an increase in the total number entering foster care, after five years of declines. 
 Under state law, any parent can demand that the city help supervise and even take custody of any child who is considered "truant," "ungovernable" or "incorrigible." Until July of this year, children were eligible up until their 16th birthday.
Last year, roughly 5,000 parents applied for help under the Persons in Need of Supervision program. Under pressure from parents in Staten Island and in upstate New York, Gov. George E. Pataki signed an expansion of the law to include 16- and 17-year-olds. 
The city's Administration for Children's Services has already seen its monthly caseload go up by 45 percent in eight weeks, and word of mouth is still filtering out to parents about the change in eligibility.
Nationally, 16- and 17-year-olds account for about half of noncriminal supervision cases, according to the Vera Institute of Justice, an urban policy research center based in New York.
The institute estimates the city's PINS cases will double to 10,000 as the full impact of the law is realized.
Older teenagers pose a challenge to the system because their problems tend to be more entrenched and there are fewer programs geared to their needs. "Their problems aren't different, but the severity of problems is greater," said Michele Dubowy, an executive with the Children's Aid Society, which is under contract to provide social services to PINS families in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
"A 15-year-old has missed some school, but a 16-year-old may have been out of school altogether for a year," Ms. Dubowy said. "Does the Department of Education have a program for somebody like that? I don't think so."
The Vera institute also estimates that handling the new caseload could cost the city an extra $50 million a year. But the Administration for Children's Services has already seen its budget slashed by $130 million this fiscal year, and it is unlikely that the city will come up with the money needed to handle the expected surge of troubled teenagers.
Instead, the city is moving toward putting more emphasis on its intensive family therapy service, known as PINS Diversion, which it hopes will keep kids out of the PINS system altogether. By December, it hopes to have shifted the entry point of the program from the Department of Probation, where it has been for decades, to teams of community-based social workers who have up to 90 days to diagnose a child's problem and to find the appropriate treatment. Parents are being discouraged from requesting the system's penal and foster care alternatives, although doing so remains their ultimate right.
Such an approach is less expensive, but the city says its primary motivation is to provide the best solutions for families. "This is a mandate that recognizes the underpinning of what we are dealing with," said William C. Bell, the children's services commissioner. "You are dealing with someone who has chosen not to respond to authority, and the authority of the child welfare system is very limited to begin with."
He said parents often enter their child in the program with the expectation that it will be a boot camp. But they soon find that the system can seem more like a paper tiger. Judges, for example, can order teenagers to go to school but cannot jail them or otherwise punish them if they defy the order.
Similarly, liability concerns prevent foster care providers from using more than verbal persuasion to try to stop a child from leaving a foster residence. "That is why our whole focus is on re-engaging the child and on stabilizing the home situation," Mr. Bell said.
Counseling focused on giving the family relief appears to make a difference in many cases. Annette Baez credits social workers from the Staten Island PINS program with helping her reach her 16-year-old daughter, Linette. Ms. Baez, who has an administrative job with the Police Department, approached the program last July, after Linette, who had been cutting school, ran away from home for two and a half days.
Ms. Baez said she never intended to have her daughter enter the foster care system. Instead, she said, she went to PINS as a preventive measure. "I didn't want A.C.S. to find out my kid wasn't in school or on the streets and have them come take her away from me," she said, "I also did this to protect myself legally, so everyone would know I had done everything I could."
In her 30-day assessment of the case, Tina DiMartino, a social worker for the program, helped the family identify some of the underlying causes of Linette's disruptive behavior. Those factors included the death of Ms. Baez's father, who had been a major presence in Linette's life. Ms. DiMartino also helped broker a kind of truce, getting Ms. Baez to relax Linette's weekend curfew and to open her mind to the possibility of Linette's earning a high school equivalency degree. In return, Linette promised to stay in class this year and not run away again.
Ms. Baez said that she and her daughter were fighting a lot less these days and that Linette was going to school. Lounging on the L-shaped couch in her mother's home, however, Linette said, with a glimmer of a smile, "I am only being good because I don't want them to put me away."
Lawyers and social workers say the city is moving in the right direction, arguing that family court and foster care are the last places the teenagers belong. Still, they know that the process of re-engaging a family with the child, especially after a crisis point has been reached, is easier said than done.
The city has been diverting PINS children and their families into social service therapy since 1987, although the program dates back several decades. While the program has reduced the number of families seeking solutions in family court, it has not reduced the percentage of children who end up in foster care. Last year, 14 percent of those who went through the program were sent to foster care, the same percentage as in 1981. The Vera institute estimates that the state's change in age requirements could send an additional 500 into foster care annually.
Warren Lyons, the director of the PINS Diversion Program in Staten Island, estimated that 60 percent of the families he sees come in with the goal of removing a child from the home. Through persuasion and counseling, he and his staff are able to talk many families into staying together.
For those teenagers who need to be moved -- because of mental disorders or because they need a respite from highly charged family situations -- there are not nearly enough good facilities available, however.
That has led to cases in which the parents and social service providers are frustrated with the outcome. For example, Randy Brown of Staten Island contacted the program in April after his common-law stepson, Rasheed, turned 16 and his rebellious behavior increased. Already frequently out of the house for days at a time, Rasheed started running away for weeks at a time, and he was failing in school. After he was injured in a stabbing, his family feared both drug and gang involvement.
Despite promising to shape up, the boy continued his ways. Finally, PINS helped place Rasheed in a foster home, giving both Rasheed and his family a chance to cool off. 
Mr. Brown said the foster home was a huge disappointment.
"He is having fun there," he said. "He is still not going to school, still running the streets to all hours. There is no structure and no guidance. We are losing him to the streets. His future looks very dim to me." 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 29, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about a change in New York State law that will increase the caseload for a city program providing supervision for troubled teenagers misstated the Vera Institute of Justice's estimate of the related cost increase. It is $20 million a year; $50 million is an estimate of the program's total cost after the change.

HEADLINE: HOSTAGE DRAMA IN MOSCOW: THE AFTERMATH; 
Hostage Toll in Russia Over 100; Nearly All Deaths Linked to Gas

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
The number of hostages who died as a result of a raid on a Moscow theater jumped to 117 today, as more people succumbed to the effects of a debilitating gas that Russian security forces used as they stormed the building being held by Chechen guerrillas.
 The mounting number of dead, from among more than 750 hostages, cast a deep shadow over a predawn raid that the authorities had at first hailed as a successful operation. Also darkening the mood were disclosures that doctors were almost completely unprepared to treat the hostages for gas-related problems. 
 Whether criticism would fall over President Vladimir V. Putin, who approved the raid, was less clear. Russian television, largely state-run, said little about the number of dead, or the many who are ill. The respected Moscow daily newspaper Kommersant, on the other hand, led a special edition today with the headline "Killer Gas." 
Tonight the Moscow officials who oversaw medical care for the hostages admitted that the gas had exacted a high toll but argued that it was the exceptional circumstances of its use -- not the nature of the gas itself -- that made it lethal. 
They said they were unable to identify the agent but had been told it was akin to anesthetics used to prepare hospital patients for surgery. 
"We don't know the name of the gas," Andrei P. Seltovsky, the chairman of the Health Committee of Moscow, said tonight. "The competent bodies know."
He added: "As for its action, there is no surprise for us from the toxicological point of view. It's just that the use was unusual, under unusual conditions." 
Doctors who frantically treated the hundreds of hostages transported early Saturday to local hospitals said they were tending patients who suffered from the effects of poisoning. 
Besides the hostages killed, 50 Chechen hostage takers died, the government said. None of the special forces that conducted the raid died, evidently because they did not enter the hall until the gas lifted.
A spokesman for the American Embassy here said tonight that Russia had not yet replied to a formal request by the United States for the name of the agent used in the raid. 
Whatever the nature of the gas or its use, it appears to have claimed the life of one of every seven civilians seized by the Chechen guerrillas who invaded a musical play at a converted Soviet culture palace last Wednesday evening. 
Of the 117 hostages confirmed dead so far, the Moscow health committee said tonight, only one had died of gunshot wounds. The remaining 116 hostages appear to have died of gas-related injuries. 
Of the hundreds more who remain hospitalized, committee officials said, 145 were in intensive care, some gravely ill. Virtually all of those also were suffering the effects of the still-unnamed gas. 
Only 51 of the dead have been identified, including three foreigners from the Netherlands, Austria and Germany. The United States Embassy here, which earlier said that three Americans had been taken hostage, stated tonight that it could now confirm only two. 
In but one indication of the confusion that still enveloped the rescue operation nearly two days after its end, an embassy spokesman said the United States government had yet to find one American, identified elsewhere as a 49-year-old Oklahoma man, Sandy Booker, in the 14 hospitals to which hostages were taken. 
The other, identified only as Natalia Aleshnya, was visited by embassy physicians tonight in a Moscow intensive care ward. She did not appear to be in serious danger. 
With weekend interviews with the hostages and other accounts, it has become increasingly clear that much of the original account provided by Russian officials was erroneous or, in the case of the death and injury toll, underestimated. 
That included the original explanation offered on Saturday for the raid -- that Russian special forces had rushed the building after Chechen guerrillas began carrying out their long-threatened promises to execute hostages. 
In fact, it became known today, the raid had been planned almost since the hostages were taken Wednesday evening during a performance of a musical called "Nord-Ost," and it was even rehearsed on Friday at a Moscow cultural center with the same layout as the one under siege. 
The shootings of two hostages cited as justification for the raid occurred about three hours before the raid itself, after one hostage apparently cracked under pressure and moved toward the guerrillas, witnesses said tonight. 
The raid began at about 5 a.m., when special forces pumped into the theater's ventilation system what an unnamed special operations officer, quoted today in a rare Sunday edition of Kommersant, called a "combat nervous paralyzing gas." 
Kommersant quoted the officer as saying that the troops also threw several grenades filled with gas into the hall. 
That officer and others cited in Moscow news accounts today said that snipers shot the unconscious guerrillas carrying explosives, all of them evidently women, to prevent them from detonating their bombs. "We were finishing off all those who had explosives on them because people could come to or, on the contrary, convulsions could start," the officer was quoted as saying. 
Video of the inside of the theater widely broadcast this weekend showed a number of female hostage-takers slumped dead in theater seats with no visible bullet wounds. That comported with reports elsewhere that guerrillas as well as their captives had died from the effects of the gas. 
Many of the hostages were already asleep when the raid began before dawn. Several who were interviewed today said they could recall little of what happened. Those who had been awake had but fragmentary memories of shots and explosions, but quickly lost consciousness. 
Several of the survivors who escaped with less severe injuries said they had covered their faces with wet handkerchiefs or clothing, minimizing their exposure. One hostage, an economist, said some of the hostage-takers did as well. 
"They put handkerchiefs on their face," said the hostage, who identified himself as Vladimir Nikolayevich. 
"I did the same. It smelled of grass and ginger. Then I lost consciousness and woke up in an ambulance." 
Today, Moscow health officials said that the gas's effects might have varied according to where the hostages sat in the theater and to the state of their health and to other factors like their age. 
There were no doctors on hand at the theater to provide emergency treatment to the most seriously injured hostages, a standard practice in disasters, a failing compounded by the amount of time -- 90 minutes -- that was needed to carry 763 hostages form the building and into waiting vehicles. 
Moreover, health officials said tonight that they were not notified until "a very short time" before the raid took place that they should be prepared to treat patients for overdoses. 
One doctor said tonight that hospitals were instructed to use Naloxone, a drug commonly prescribed to counteract opiates like heroin and methadone, to treat victims. The Moscow daily newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets quoted an unidentified hospital physician as saying that the order to use Naloxone came only after the theater had been stormed, and that ambulances on the scene carried only a basic supply of the drug. 
Hundreds of hostages were carried to hospitals not in ambulances, but in city buses, and therefore had no access to drugs at all. 
One diplomatic official said many of those in hospitals were still suffering from the effects of the agent, leaving many unconscious or disoriented. 
"These people are still heavily under the influence of what was used on them," the official said. 
The use of the gas raised questions about Russia's compliance with the treaty banning chemical weapons, which Russia has signed and ratified. 
The treaty, known as the Chemical Weapons Convention, allows the use of chemical agents like tear gas for "law enforcement including domestic riot control." 
At the same time, it prohibits the use of many common chemical agents in any circumstances and requires that "riot control agents" have effects that "disappear within a short time following termination of exposure." 
In Phoenix today, where President Bush stopped after a summit meeting in Mexico, the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, declined to comment on the Russian decision to use gas to end the hostage siege. 
"The president abhors the loss of all life," he said. "This is a reminder of the tragedy that can unfold when terrorists attack." 
Asked whether that was an endorsement of the use of gas, Mr. Fleischer said: "We didn't say that. We don't know what all the facts are."

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
I.B.M. looks into the future and sees companies buying their computing services as needed, something like electricity.

BYLINE:  By Steve Lohr 

 BODY:
SINCE he took over as I.B.M.'s chief executive eight months ago, Samuel J. Palmisano has moved swiftly to cut costs, jettison lagging operations and add to the company's big-services business.
 When the slump in technology spending deepened, he shut down some of I.B.M.'s older semiconductor plants and sold off its hard-disk drive business to Hitachi. He has trimmed the work force by 5 percent, or 15,600 employees. He bought PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting for $3.5 billion, in a deal that closed this month, to bolster I.B.M.'s services business. 
 The result has been that I.B.M. has weathered the technology storm better than most others. But the industry remains depressed and rudderless. What will start the industry moving again? What's next?
Reasonable questions, it seems, for the man who heads the computer company that spends by far the most on research and development. In a speech on Wednesday morning, before a few hundred corporate customers and industry analysts in New York, Mr. Palmisano intends to provide some answers. I.B.M. is not saying, but analysts who have been partly briefed on Mr. Palmisano's talk say he will articulate I.B.M.'s view of the future of computing as a utility-like service that companies can buy as needed, somewhat like electricity.
The utility concept, also called computing on demand, builds on work that has been nurtured in I.B.M.'s research labs, and elsewhere, for years and has been making its way into the marketplace recently. This work includes computer systems and networks of computers that use clever software and hardware to manage workloads and to detect and fix bugs on their own -- an initiative I.B.M. terms "autonomic computing," after the human autonomic nervous system, which automatically handles basic functions like breathing and digestion. 
Another ingredient is "grid" software, which shares computing resources and programs across networks. The grid software effort originated in the research community, led by computer scientists like Ian Foster of the Argonne National Laboratory and Carl Kesselman of the University of Southern California. The grids were initially designed to help scientists collaborate on complex projects that require massive amounts of firepower, like climate modeling and high-energy physics. But grids are being used in efforts including breast cancer research and oil exploration.
I.B.M. is by no means alone in its pursuit of utility computing or computing on demand. Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, EDS, Accenture and other companies are working on the software, hardware and services for utility computing. And industry experts recognize this as a potentially important direction for computing.
In a recent report, Steven Milunovich, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, wrote: "The next big thing is the Internet as a distributed computing platform. Grid computing is distributing applications over the Internet, which allows companies to share not only computing resources but data." The report added, "Utility (or on-demand) computing is coming."
Next big thing, perhaps, but not really new. The utility concept has been around for four decades, first advanced by Herbert Grosch, an industry pundit who once worked for I.B.M. And computer time-sharing -- the hot idea of the 1960's, both in the research community and on Wall Street -- was a form of computing on demand. But the time-sharing systems of the 1960's proved unable to scale up beyond a couple of hundred users.
They were projects that staggered under the weight of their own complexity, given the hardware and software tools of the time. A renowned flameout of the late 1960's, the Berkeley Computer Corporation, employed some brilliant computing minds including Butler Lampson, Charles Thacker and Charles Simonyi. After the time-sharing failure, they went on to become part of the team at Xerox PARC during the 1970's, where so much of the fundamental technology of personal computing was developed.
Yet the modern advocates of utility computing point out that decades of advances in processing power, storage, networking and software make a huge difference. The Internet itself, they note, originated in the 1960's, but it wasn't until the 1990's, when all the technical ingredients fell into place, that it moved into the mainstream.
A similar phenomenon may be under way for computing on demand, as continuous progress in a range of related fields have enabled engineers to divide and conquer complexity in new ways. This means that grid-like distributed computing has a chance of moving into the mainstream.
"All these advances -- faster and faster processing, better systems administration tools and the maturity of software communications standards -- have really turned utility computing into a much more doable proposition," said Glen Salow, the chief information officer of the American Express Company. Earlier this year, American Express agreed to a seven-year computing-on-demand deal with I.B.M., after Mr. Salow became convinced that the pay-for-use, utility model would afford his company both reliability and cost-saving flexibility.
I.B.M., to be sure, faces plenty of competition in the emerging market for utility computing. Yet the company has some obvious advantages. I.B.M. seems to have the most ambitious approach with the most pieces of the technology in place. The implicit sales pitch -- don't worry, we'll take care of all that computing complexity for you -- is the message of I.B.M.'s big-services business. It echoes I.B.M.'s past as well, though in the mainframe era that meant buying the closed world of I.B.M. hardware and software.
"The model is kind of a variation of the mainframe days," observed Tom Bittman, an analyst for Gartner Inc. "But in the new world, I.B.M. is not locking customers into its proprietary technology as it did before."
In recent years, I.B.M. has displayed a deft hand in explaining unfamiliar new technology to the corporate establishment, which is I.B.M.'s customer franchise. Big Blue exploited the rise of the Internet in the 1990's by telling its corporate customers that the significance was not in viewing Web pages or "new media." No, I.B.M. insisted, the real payoff from the Internet was as a low-cost communications medium for reducing transaction costs of all kinds for business. Mr. Palmisano's predecessor, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., termed the dot-com startups "fireflies before the storm." I.B.M. dubbed its Internet idea "e-business" and marketed it hard and successfully.
In championing utility computing, I.B.M. and Mr. Palmisano face a similar challenge, but in a very different environment. In the latter half of the 1990's, the economy was booming and technological euphoria was in the air. Today, with the economy weak and technology viewed skeptically, I.B.M. runs the risk of marching off in a new direction only to find it has few followers.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE U.N. DEBATE; 
Holding Swing Vote, Mexico Tells Bush It Won't Support Iraq Resolution U.S. Favors

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
President Bush left a summit conference here today without a pledge from Mexico to support the American resolution in the United Nations Security Council to disarm Iraq.
 Mexican officials made it clear that Mexico is siding with France in the debate at the United Nations. While the United States is demanding one resolution that includes a legal basis for the military action against Iraq, France wants two stages, authorizing force only when Baghdad fails to comply with weapons inspections. 
 Mexico is a crucial swing vote in the Security Council, and the lack of explicit support from President Fox is a setback to the United States in what American officials say will be the final days of the difficult deliberations. 
Mr. Fox said Mexico's priority is to achieve a resolution with the broadest possible backing from the 15-nation Council.
"The crucial thing is collective action," he said a few hours after meeting for about 35 minutes with Mr. Bush, who seemed somewhat short-tempered after their discussion. American officials had expected that Mexico, one of the 10 nonpermanent members of the Council, would be what one called "an easy vote."
The lack of agreement on Iraq came as Mexico and the United States also reported scant progress of the bilateral agenda that Mr. Fox has been promoting, especially on his push for a broad immigration agreement.
Mr. Bush says he will "lead a coalition to disarm Iraq" unilaterally if the 15-member Security Council does not pass a strongly worded American resolution for inspecting and dismantling Iraq's weaponry. That proposal contains the implicit threat of immediate military action if Iraq resists.
France has said it does not want a confrontation with Washington but rather is striving to close the gap between their views in the final stage of the high-stakes negotiations. 
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who only recently was openly optimistic about the American resolution's prospects at the United Nations, said Saturday that a victory there "may evade us." He added, "We have reached the point where we have to make a few fundamental decisions" in the next few days.
A Security Council resolution must pass with at least 9 votes in favor and no negative vote from any of the five permanent members. Among the permanent Council members -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- only Britain unequivocally supports the American proposal. Among the 10 nonpermanent members, so far only five have clearly indicated they will vote with the United States. That leaves Mexico along with Ireland as pivotal swing votes. 
Because of Mexico's close economic ties with the United States, and the personal friendship betwen President Fox and President Bush, American officials had expected Mexican cooperation.
But even a 9-to-6 resolution would be a diplomatic debacle for the United States, a senior Mexican official said, arguing that a split decision would send a signal of disunity and division.
The two nations made no progress in a series of meetings this week on other major issues that both draw them together and pull them apart, including trade and migration.
"We're about where we were -- not any closer than we were before, not further," said Mexico's foreign minister, Jorge G. Casteneda.
"What we want is a resolution that is approved by all 15 -- or 14 -- members of the Security Council," said Mr. Castaneda. "We think that's more important for the United States' cause." The 15th vote would be Syria's, but no one thinks it will vote against Iraq.
Unanimity, the members agree, would be a good thing. But none exists today.
France has circulated an informal alternative to the American resolution. Its text omits two crucial words from the American proposal, which would find Iraq in "material breach" of a number of past Security Council resolutions.
France and other nations consider that phrase a tripwire that would authorize the United States to decide whether to go to war with Iraq regardless of the results of weapon inspections. 
While Mr. Bush, Secretary Powell and the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, attended the 21-nation Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation talks here this weekend, Secretary Powell and the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, spoke several times by telephone, as did the American and French ambassadors to the United Nations, John D. Negroponte and Jean-David Levitte, diplomats said.
The United States and Mexico find themselves at an impasse as well, with little sign of progress or compromise on Mr. Fox's dream of an accord on migration. The extent to which that standoff may affect Mexico's position on Iraq is unclear. It is clearly cooling the relationship between the two nations.
Mr. Fox seeks some legal rights for more than three million undocumented Mexican immigrants in the United States, along with more visas and expanded guest-worker programs. He says implementation of those goals will benefit both the security and the economy of the United States.
On average, between 300 and 400 Mexican migrants die every year trying to cross the border. In January, when tariffs are lifted on a slew of heavily subsidized American farm products under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the flow of cheap American food and feed will become a flood, potentially swamping Mexican farmers and small businesses. Mexico says that may drive many more people north seeking work.
But Mr. Fox got nothing from President Bush, save a noncommittal response when he invited him for a state visit next year. "Time and circumstance have not allowed us to progress with the speed we want," Mr. Fox said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 29, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A headline yesterday and a front-page summary for an article about President Bush's visit to Mexico misstated the facts of the article, about Mexico's stance in the United Nations Security Council toward Iraq. Mexico gave President Bush no pledge to support the United States resolution in the Council. But President Vicente Fox did not tell Mr. Bush that Mexico would not support it.

HEADLINE: Political Notebook; 
Bush Juggles the Roles of Leader and Cheerleader

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
Every modern American president is forced to learn the art of switching rhetorical modes, from the stern tones of leader-of-the-free-world to the folksy approachability of a political cheerleader. But now, as he approaches two critical moments in the next 10 days -- a decision on whether to go it alone in Iraq and a midterm election that seems certain to determine the broad strokes of his presidency for the next two years -- George W. Bush is flipping that switch every few hours.
 All day Saturday and much of this morning at a summit meeting in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, a grim-sounding Mr. Bush was cajoling, pushing and pressuring his allies to get with the American plan on Iraq, North Korea and counterterrorism. He talked of coalition-building, but sent his spokesman and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell out to declare that the United Nations had only days left to pass a stiff resolution making it clear that Iraq had to choose between disarmament and war. 
 But by this afternoon, flying Air Force One into Phoenix, a different, more colloquial, more jovial Mr. Bush was on display at an event for Matt Salmon, who is in a tight race for governor here against Janet Napolitano. "When he says he's not raising taxes, book it," Mr. Bush told 5,000 supporters of Mr. Salmon and Rick Renzi, who is running for the House seat from the area. He ended the rally with his signature phrase -- which he carefully did not utter in Mexico -- that "America is the greatest nation, full of the most decent people, on the face of the earth."
What he did not say is that the race to keep the House in Republican hands and win back the Senate suddenly seems to have the White House political team more nervous than it has been in months. So Mr. Bush will spend the next several days dealing with two tense political battles at once: a public one to push Republicans in the tightest races around the country over the line to victory and a private one to outmaneuver Russia, France and other allies over the wording of the United Nations resolution on Iraq.
The political race seems to have Mr. Bush charged up, his aides say, while the United Nations struggle has him fuming at the recalcitrance of old allies.
His schedule in the next few days reflects the demands of the twin battles. After spending the night at the historic Biltmore Hotel here, he plans to stop in New Mexico and Colorado on Monday for several more political appearances, before returning to Washington for two days of twisting world leaders' arms. Mr. Powell suggested that in the next few days the president would have to make a "fundamental" decision about whether to continue or abandon the United Nations effort -- in essence, whether to announce that the United States would assemble its own coalition against Mr. Hussein, without explicit authorization.
On Thursday the president is off to South Dakota, Indiana and West Virginia. From Friday through Monday he is scheduled to hopscotch across the country in a last-minute bid to tip the closest races to Republicans.
Behind the scenes, his aides concede they are growing more pessimistic about winning in New Jersey, where Democrats switched horses at the last moment. On Saturday, several of Mr. Bush's operatives discussed how to deal with Minnesota, where he has repeatedly visited on behalf of Norm Coleman, the Republican who was seeking to unseat Senator Paul Wellstone, who died in a plane crash on Friday. The aides said they doubted that Mr. Bush could visit the state again under the circumstances. One participant in the conversation said that if former Vice President Walter F. Mondale agrees to enter the race, "I think this one is over for us."

Keeping Things Moving
If there there was a theme to the president's weekend in Mexico, it might have been this: Let's get this over with.
His joint meeting with President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan -- Washington's two greatest allies in Asia -- lasted precisely 24 minutes, his staff reported. It's not as if there was nothing on the agenda: all three countries are facing one of the greatest security challenges in Asia in years, starting with North Korea's revelation that it has cheated on agreements with all three barring the development of nuclear weapons, and Al Qaeda is resurgent in Southeast Asia. What about Japan's financial meltdown? "The subject never came up," said a Japanese official who was at the meeting.
Then came the official dinner of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum on Saturday night. Mr. Bush is known to particularly dislike these formal occasions, with their long toasts, longer cultural entertainment and stilted conversation. Even as his motorcade was revving up on Saturday night, his aides were speculating about how long their boss would put up with it.
Once there, Mr. Bush found himself sitting in "protocol order" on a long stage, nearest to the Vietnamese prime minister, Phan Van Khai. It was unclear from television images how much Mr. Bush had to discuss with the prime minister, who was a dedicated North Vietnamese Communist, trained in the Soviet Union, and who is now an advocate of capitalist changes. But at 9:50 p.m., 40 minutes before the scheduled end of the dinner, Mr. Bush's motorcade was rocketing back to the hotel.
Today, after getting up for a sunrise run along the beach, Mr. Bush attended more meetings. But they ran significantly behind schedule, and the president appeared fidgety and eager to keep things moving during the traditional reading of the summit meeting's final declaration. So it was no surprise when he raced through the farewell lunch as fast as he could, headed for Air Force One and took off for Arizona.

Have a Cigar?
If ever there is a place in America where foreign policy and local politics regularly intersect, it is Florida, where Jeb Bush is trying to hold onto his job as governor. So the younger Bush takes heart whenever his brother's administration pleases the Cuban-American community by tightening the economic embargo against Fidel Castro's Cuba.
That embargo includes cigars, though President John F. Kennedy, the legend goes, secured an impressive personal supply before banning their importation 40 years ago. Perhaps inspired by the Kennedy precedent, some midlevel administration officials were inspecting a humidor full of fine Cohibas at the president's hotel on Saturday night. Spotting a reporter (who, truth be told, was seriously contemplating an embargo violation himself), one of the officials raised his fingers to his lips.
"Don't tell Jeb," he said with a smile.

HEADLINE: 'In Material Breach' 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
If the U.N Security Council fails to adopt a resolution holding Iraq "in material breach" of its many disarmament agreements, that refusal will have consequences for the U.N. and several of its member nations.
 The State Department cannot say that, of course, because our diplomacy with Council members rests on persuasion, not threats. But should the U.N. deny the fact of Saddam's repeated and sustained defiance of its irresolute resolutions, the world body will henceforth play only in a little league of nations. 
 Every diplomat knows what "in material breach" means: as called for in the resolution put forward by the U.S. and Britain, that phrase clears the way for the liberation of Iraq. If Saddam does not promptly come into total compliance with no-nonsense inspections, we would have the useful, though not necessary, U.N. coloration for our overthrow of the outlaw regime. 
Russia, France, China and Mexico lead the pack wanting to strip that triggering phrase from the declared U.S. position. If they succeed, their "no" votes would assert that Saddam is not in material breach of a dozen previous Security Council orders, which Baghdad would interpret as a legal triumph. It would also show that Colin Powell's faith in the U.N. system and his own persuasive powers has been grievously misplaced.
What would be the consequences of a victory by Saddam over the U.S. in the Security Council? If President Bush were to meekly accept the rebuff of a further watering-down of the U.S.-British resolution, his administration would become a laughingstock. Worse, the world would have no way to restrain nuclear blackmail. 
That won't happen. Should Vladimir Putin and Jacques Chirac lead the Council down the path of appeasement, Bush will undertake the liberation of the Iraqi people with an ad hoc coalition of genuine allies. And here is one pundit's assessment of the likely consequences: 
After our victory in the second gulf war, Britain would replace France as the chief European dealer in Iraqi oil and equipment. Syria, the Security Council member that has been the black-market conduit for Saddam's black gold, would be frozen out. The government of New Iraq, under the tutelage and initial control of the victorious coalition, and prosperous after shedding the burden of a huge army and corrupt Baath Party, would reimburse the U.S. and Britain for much of their costs in the war and transitional government out of future oil revenues and contracts. 
If Turkey's powerful army on Iraq's border significantly shortens the war, its longtime claim to royalties from the Kirkuk oil fields would at last be honored. This would recompense the Turks for the decade of economic distress caused by the gulf wars, and be an incentive for them to patch up relations with pro-democracy Iraqi Kurds fighting Saddam at their side.
The evolving democratic government of New Iraq would repudiate the corrupt $8 billion "debt" that Russia claims was run up by Saddam. Even more troubling to Putin will be the heavy investment to be made by the U.S. and British companies that will sharply increase the drilling and refining capacity of the only nation whose oil reserves rival those of Russia, Saudi Arabia and Mexico. 
Rising production from a non-OPEC Iraq, matched by Saudi price cuts from princes desperate to hold market share, could well reduce world oil prices by a third. This would be a great boon to the poor in many developing nations, rejuvenate Japan and encourage prosperity worldwide, though it would temporarily impoverish Putin's Russia, now wholly dependent on oil revenues. 
Such economic consequences to nations that help or hinder us in the U.N. this week do not compare to the human-rights benefits to millions of Iraqis liberated from oppression and to Arabs from Cairo to Gaza in dire need of an example of freedom.
That moral dimension of the need to overthrow Saddam is of no interest to ultrapragmatists in the Security Council. That is why our resolution holding him "in material breach" of U.N orders to stop building mass-murder weapons and encouraging world terror is bottomed on self-defense against a serial aggressor. But the Paris-Moscow-Beijing axis of greed -- whose commerce-driven politicians seek to prop up the doomed Saddam in the U.N. -- will find its policy highly unprofitable.

Reserve Call-Up for Iraq May Match 1991 War
If President Bush orders an attack against Iraq, the Pentagon has plans to mobilize roughly as many reservists as it did during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, when about 265,000 members of the National Guard and Reserves were summoned to active duty, administration officials and military experts say.

Al Qaeda in Southeast Asia
The terrorist network that Osama bin Laden has stealthily built up in Southeast Asia over the past decade is still largely intact, intelligence officials in several countries said in interviews over the last week.

Of the 117 hostages confirmed dead so far, 116 died from the effects of the gas. What unfolded in the theater appears to have amounted to a risky test of a previously undisclosed chemical agent that ended disastrously. Officials refused either to confirm that or to identify the gas, rebuffing even a direct request from the United States Embassy. A10

Sniper Killing of Woman Is Laid to Teenage Suspect
Prosecutors in Virginia have evidence that John Lee Malvo, the 17-year-old charged with John Allen Muhammad in the Washington-area sniper shootings, was the gunman in at least one of the shootings. Dueling jurisdictions want control of the case, and the new evidence was used to assert that Virginia was the best venue for the first trial of the pair, who could be eligible for the death penalty. A1

Mr. Muhammad and Mr. Malvo, if convicted, would add a peculiar chapter to the already saturated history of the multiple killer. As criminologists and academicians try to find the proper context for the sniper suspects, they have been struck by how unconventional the two appear to be. A16

HEADLINE: Leftist Handily Wins Brazilian Presidential Race 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Monday, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
Brazil took a decisive turn to the left on Sunday, electing as its new president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers' Party, a former factory worker, labor union leader and political prisoner who has never before held executive office. The margin of victory for Mr. da Silva was the largest in Brazilian history.
 With 99 percent of the ballots tallied in Sunday's runoff, Mr. da Silva was leading handily with 61.2 percent of the vote, compared with 38.8 percent for his rival, Jose Serra of the centrist Brazilian Social Democratic Party, which has governed this nation of 175 million people for the past eight years. His dominance, with nearly 52 million votes, gives him an indisputable mandate to remake Latin America's most populous country. 
 "This is a true landslide, an historic shift of direction, which shows how much this country wants change," said Candido Mendes, a leading political scientist here and the author of "Lula: An Option More Than a Vote." "Lula has won in every region of the country and at every strata of society." 
Mr. da Silva's resounding victory is also likely to reverberate abroad, energizing the left throughout Latin America and further unnerving international financial markets. The Workers' Party has been a consistent critic of the United States and the values it espouses, and has promised to reduce what it calls Brazil's economic and political "subservience" to foreign interests.
Even before the voting began, President Fidel Castro of Cuba hailed Mr. da Silva's victory, telling reporters in Havana, "We are friends and I admire his perseverance." President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela spoke of Mr. da Silva joining him in a Latin American "axis of good." The White House was less enthusiastic, with the president's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, saying Sunday night that President Bush "looks forward to working productively with Brazil."
"Hope has vanquished fear," Mr. da Silva said Sunday night in Sao Paulo after Mr. Serra called him to concede. He said that as president he would "do everything within my reach to bring peace to our continent" and "build a country that has more justice, brotherhood and solidarity."
Brazil's willingness to elect a working-class president for the first time in its history had been clear since the initial round of balloting on Oct. 6, when Mr. da Silva fell just short of the majority he needed to avoid a runoff with Mr. Serra."
But the "red wave" that some political commentators had predicted would sweep Brazil today did not materialize, as Mr. da Silva's coattails proved shorter than he had hoped. Though the Workers' Party picked up numerous new congressional seats in the first round, its candidates in runoffs for state governorships did not fare as well on Sunday. As a result, the five largest of Brazil's 27 states will be governed by other parties. 
Nevertheless, Mr. da Silva's overwhelming victory makes him Brazil's first left-wing president in more than 40 years and the first ever to win the post at the polls.
In three previous attempts at the presidency, Mr. da Silva had never won more than a quarter of the total votes cast in the first round. In those earlier races, his party's program was deemed too radical and the angry, vindictive tone of his speeches alarmed voters. But after losing emphatically in 1998, he began to moderate the Workers' Party platform and his own image, a process that gave birth to what the Brazilian press has come to call "Lula Light." (In an odd twist, "lite" has been adopted as "light" in Portuguese.)
Since then, the Workers' Party has abandoned its demands that Brazil break with the free-market economic model and default on its foreign debt. Mr. da Silva himself trimmed his unruly beard, tried to be less irascible and began dressing in suits and ties, though keeping his ever-present lapel pin with his party's emblem, the red star.
With growth throttled, the country's currency losing more than a quarter of its value against the dollar this year and unemployment soaring, Mr. da Silva's attacks on the policies of the current government have proved more popular than in the past. He also promised to create 10 million new jobs during his four- year term and to bring down interest rates, which at 21 percent are among the highest in the world.
"It's time to give Lula a chance, because the current approach clearly isn't working," Carolina Figueiredo, a schoolteacher here, said this morning after voting. "He's been working hard and honestly for this for 22 years, and both he and the Workers Party have matured enough that I am willing to put the destiny of the country in their hands."
But when Mr. da Silva takes office on Jan. 1, Brazil is likely to undergo a change not just of policies but also of style. In sharp contrast to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, an urbane former sociology professor who speaks five languages fluently, Mr. da Silva left school after finishing the fifth grade, is occasionally flummoxed by the Portuguese language and prides himself on being a man of the people.
Da Silva is the most common surname in this country, and when the president-elect first ran for office two decades ago, one of his campaign slogans was "a Brazilian just like you." During this year's campaign he took a similar tack, accusing the nation's elite of being selfish and incompetent and arguing that it was time for ordinary Brazilians to have their voices heard.
"I want my victory to symbolize that nobody is inferior to anybody else," Mr. da Silva said in a speech on Wednesday. "A lathe operator can be more competent in doing politics than many political scientists."
Mr. da Silva, who turned 57 today, was born in the arid northeastern state of Pernambuco, one of Brazil's poorest. Both his parents were farm laborers, but at the age of 7, Mr. da Silva moved southward to the industrial state of Sao Paulo, where his father, who had migrated earlier in hopes of improving the family's fortunes, was working as a stevedore.
In Sao Paulo, however, the family remained mired in poverty: as Mr. da Silva reminded Brazilian voters in a campaign-closing television debate on Friday night, for a while he lived in a shack, "and there is nothing agreeable about that." At age 12, he went to work full time, initially as an office boy and eventually as a worker in a metallurgical plant, where he lost part of the little finger on his left hand in an industrial accident.
By 1975, Mr. da Silva was president of the metalworkers' union in Sao Bernardo do Campo. In the late 1970's, he led a series of strikes that made him a national figure and brought about his arrest and imprisonment by the right-wing military dictatorship then in power.
Freed in 1980 after a worldwide campaign in which he was called "the Lech Walesa of Brazil," Mr. da Silva, along with a group of intellectuals, labor leaders, Liberation Theology advocates and environmentalists soon thereafter founded the Workers' Party. While leftists in neighboring countries like Colombia and Peru migrated to guerrilla movements, the Workers' Party remained patient, learning from its mistakes and performing better in each successive election.
"This is a great victory for democracy and for our people," Jose Dirceu, a guerrilla-turned-congressman who is Mr. da Silva's closest political associate, said on Sunday night. "But it is also a great victory for the Workers' Party."

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB; 
Available Spaces Behind The Prescription Counter

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
SOMETIMES a job pays well but perhaps not well enough. While other health care positions go begging because nurses and others feel that they are being paid too little to care for too many patients, pharmacy has generally been viewed as a lucrative and attractive profession. But many hospitals and clinics, in addition to drugstores and retailers, are struggling to find pharmacists. Although pharmacists, even right out of school, can earn about $80,000 a year, industry executives say it remains a challenge to find licensed people. 
 There are about 200,000 licensed pharmacists in the United States. About two-thirds fill prescriptions and dispense advice to patients in drugstores, supermarkets or other retailers. An additional 25 percent work in hospitals and nursing homes. An increasing number are women, many of whom prefer to work part time. 
 As more prescriptions are being written, a result of a large aging population and the increasing availability of more medications, the pharmacist shortage has become acute. There were nearly 7,000 vacancies in 2000, up from about 2,700 in early 1998, according to a December 2000 report by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
In chain drugstores alone, vacancies stood at about 5,745 in July, according to the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.
Increasing demand for pharmacists, like the demand for other health care workers, explains only part of the shortage. While pharmacy is considered a good career -- and some colleges are noting a rising interest in the major -- it can take as long as six years to train for the profession. Moreover, it may not pay much higher than the low six figures annually, without significant increase throughout a career.
"The single biggest issue is the economic model," said Anthony J. Cuti, the chairman and chief executive of Duane Reade, a New York drugstore chain, who considers the educational requirements too high.
There are 84 schools in the United States offering degrees in pharmacy. 
Yet, said Charles F. Monahan Jr., president of the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in Boston and Worcester, "We're having a difficult time convincing high school graduates to go six years." 
Some colleges are offering abbreviated degree programs, trying to appeal to people who already have a degree or some college experience but who are looking for a career. Mr. Monahan's institution offers a degree for transfer students that can take two to three years. 
There is also widespread concern that pharmacists have little opportunity to advance. "There's a feeling you can go only so far as a pharmacist," said Joan Luciano, a managing consultant for DBM, a human resources consulting firm in New York.
In the last few years, however, those who have trained as pharmacists have found a broader array of career possibilities, working for pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, health plans or in academia. They may help develop medicines or act as consultants in educating patients about certain drugs.
"There have never been so many various opportunities as there are today," Mr. Monahan said, adding that many graduates work for a while in traditional settings before deciding to do something else. "You have a lot of entrepreneurial folks," he said.
Some leave the profession. In Massachusetts, for example, a third of the state's pharmacists have let their licenses lapse, Mr. Monahan noted. 
The good news for those who have decided to go into the field is that many drugstore chains are competing aggressively for talent, wooing freshly minted pharmacists with sign-on bonuses and other perks, like enhanced retirement benefits and stock options.
The 350 graduating students in Massachusetts all had jobs before they graduated, Mr. Monahan said. One student, promised a salary of $90,000 a year, was recently given a sign-on bonus of $16,000 by a national chain, he said. The average salary at a retail store, he added, could be roughly 20 percent higher than at a hospital.
Some pharmacists prefer to work for themselves in their own drugstore, although the number of independent stores has declined as chains have bought them out or put them out of business. At one chain, Medicine Shoppe, pharmacists can become franchisees. Some make slightly more than a hundred thousand dollars a year, while others make a couple of hundred thousand dollars. 
"I have a little more control over my life," said Rhonda Yarzab, 42, who owns a Medicine Shoppe in Greenville, Pa., with her husband, Joseph, and a satellite store in a complex of doctors' offices. The work is intense, Ms. Yarzab said, but unlike some chains, which ask pharmacists to work 10 to 12 hours a day, having her own store allows her to tailor the position somewhat to her needs. Still, she said, "I can't take a week's vacation."
The job itself has changed over the years. In addition to filling more prescriptions and counseling more patients, pharmacists must battle the numerous insurance plans and the government regarding payments for the medications. There is also greater concern about possible errors in filling prescriptions. "There's much more pressure on the pharmacist today," Ms. Luciano of DBM said.
The soft economy is having some effect. The number of vacancies among the drugstore chains has dropped slightly, and there are fewer opportunities outside the traditional workplace, said Mark Parrish, the president of Medicine Shoppe. Even many hospitals, under financial duress, are cutting back, he added. 
Yet Mr. Parrish emphasized that a shortage remains. "Instead of a level 4 hurricane, it's a level 2 hurricane," he said. "But it's still a hurricane."

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB; 
Stop the Clock? Critics Call the Billable Hour a Legal Fiction

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK 

 BODY:
IN 1996, in a taped conversation, the former associate attorney general Webster Hubbell gave his wife an education in legal ethics. He was in prison at the time, serving a sentence for tax evasion.
 "You didn't actually do that, did you?" Suzanna Hubbell asked him. "Mark up time for the client, did you?" 
 "Yes, I did," Mr. Hubbell answered. "So does every lawyer in the country." 
That may be overstating it, though many experts say the comment is essentially correct. There is certainly a widespread consensus among practitioners, judges, recruiters and academics that hourly billing leads to punishing work schedules, unhappy lawyers, ill-served clients, over-lawyered cases, perverse incentives and outright fraud.
"If one is expected to bill more than 2,000 hours per year, there are bound to be temptations to exaggerate the hours actually put in," said William H. Rehnquist, the chief justice of the United States, in a 1987 speech.
In one of his last acts as president of the American Bar Association, Robert E. Hirshon bit the hand that feeds his profession. "Many of the legal profession's contemporary woes intersect at the billable hour," he wrote in a report in August on hourly billing. 
There is, said June Eichbaum, a legal recruiter at Heidrick & Struggles in New York, only one product in a typical law firm's inventory, and it is not creativity, expertise or experience. "The commodity that the firm is selling is time," she said. "It's like being on an assembly line."
Time as a measure of value has plenty of critics. "It distorts the relationship between the lawyer and the client, it distorts the work that gets done, and it provides enormous incentives to slide into chronic deceptive behavior," said Lisa G. Lerman, a law professor at the Catholic University of America in Washington. She has collected scores of examples of lawyers, many with fancy resumes, who have been jailed or disbarred for billing fraud.
Mr. Hubbell, who had been mayor of Little Rock, Ark., chief justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court and chairman of the ethics committee of the Arkansas Bar Association, was accused of stealing $482,000.
By contrast, in 1986, Edward Digges, a products liability lawyer in Baltimore, billed 5,800 hours in one year. When challenged, according to court records, Mr. Digges, his partners and their wives worked frantically over a weekend to create fake records to justify fees. His firm was found to have defrauded a client of $3.1 million.
A number of judges have spoken out about questionable billing practices, generally in the process of rejecting fee requests. Edward Jellen, a bankruptcy judge in Oakland, Calif., disallowed half of a $1.35 million fee request in a bankruptcy case. "This application," Judge Jellen wrote in a decision, "represents a prime example of too many people aggressively billing too many hours for doing the unnecessary and redoing what has already been done."
Bailey Aldrich, a federal judge in Boston, refused to approve the fees of several lawyers who attended but did not participate in a hearing. "It is difficult not to be offended," he wrote, "that a court should be asked to approve charges for five lawyers who made, and who were expected to make, no contribution whatever. Lawyering is not a spectator sport, and if this is the practice of the bar, already under public criticism for high charges, I want no part of it."
Charles L. Hardy, a federal judge in Phoenix, took aim at one lawyer's bill for 18.9 hours in a single day. "To have accomplished this," he wrote in a decision, the lawyer "would have had to have been in his office from 5:06 in the morning until midnight, without taking any time for meals, to relieve himself or do anything else."
Not everyone is convinced that hourly billing is problematic. 
"I think academics don't know what they are talking about," said Bradford W. Hildebrandt, a founder of Hildebrandt International, a legal consultancy in Somerset, N.J. "Any system is subject to abuse, but I don't think lawyers are particularly dishonest with their clients. I don't think billing hours leads to the pernicious activity that some people say they do."
Thomas J. Kavaler, a partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel, a law firm in New York, said that hourly billing was imperfect but better than the alternatives. "There's comparability," he said. "It's a random unit of measure, but it takes into account your costs, your profit needs and the competition." 
Hourly billing is relatively new. It did not become widespread until the 1950's, as lawyers grew concerned about losing economic ground to other professions. 
"One of the reasons attorneys turned to hourly billing is that they found they were making less money than doctors," said William G. Ross, a law professor at Samford University in Birmingham, Ala.
But the hours in question were few by contemporary standards. In 1965, the American Bar Association found that hours billed by American lawyers ranged between 1,200 and 1,600 annually, practically a part-time schedule today. 
Larger firms now generally expect at least 2,000 to 2,200 billable hours from their associates, and billing 2,500 to 3,000 hours is not unusual. Earlier this month, associates at the New York office of Clifford Chance, the British law firm that is the world's largest, sent the partners an anguished memorandum. Its primary complaint was that the firm required 2,420 billable hours annually to qualify for a bonus. The requirement is, their memorandum said, "profoundly unrealistic," "dehumanizing" and "verging on an abdication of our professional responsibilities." It encourages, they said, "padding of hours, inefficient work, repetition of tasks and other problems."
Carl T. Bogus, a law professor at Roger Williams University in Bristol, R.I., noted that "no human being can be productive every minute of the workday."
"Lawyers must eat, interact socially with co-workers, walk down the hall for a cup of coffee, speak on the phone with spouses or friends and conduct personal business with people who can be reached only during business hours," he wrote in the Indiana Law Journal in 1996. "Lawyers must also devote time to client development, administrative matters and professional activities."
As a result, said Deborah L. Rhode, a law professor at Stanford University, lawyers billing 2,000 must work 60 hours a week. "No one working these kinds of sweatshop hours can give good legal service," she said. 
Professor Rhode said that those kinds of hours pushed lawyers in the wrong direction. "It fosters a really ethically corrosive atmosphere where everyone fudges their time sheets," she said. "If you are dishonest on your time sheet, it builds an atmosphere of cutting corners on 'little stuff' that breeds a sort of moral myopia." 
Chief Justice Rehnquist said that law firms treated "the associate very much as a manufacturer would treat a purchaser of 100 tons of scrap metal: if you use anything less than the 100 tons that you paid for, you simply are not running an efficient business."
Associate salaries, which start at around $125,000 for new associates at big firms in New York and easily top $200,000 for more senior associates, create few options for firms. Partners at such firms, whose hourly rates have been approaching $700, often make more than $1 million.
"The salary wars have only made things worse," said Susan Saab Fortney, a law professor at Texas Tech University in Lubbock. "Where is the money going to come from? It's going to come from the sweat of associates."
Lawyers may look for opportunities to make the simple complicated. "Why not leave no stone unturned if you are charging by the stone?" Professor Rhode asked.
ALTHOUGH hourly billing is by far the predominant way that lawyers charge, it is not the only way. Many plaintiffs' lawyers use contingency fees, taking a quarter or a third of any settlement or judgment they obtain. Flat fees are common for routine matters like real estate closings and wills. And criminal-defense lawyers will often take on a case for a single large retainer.
Indeed, elite practitioners sometimes complain that the really big money is made by the successful plaintiffs' lawyers, but they remain wedded to the clock. Alternatives, like flat fees, caps, success fees and various forms of contingencies, are more often discussed than employed. 
The only realistic career solution, according to many lawyers, is to move from law firms to corporate law departments and academic positions that do not require tracking one's hours.
Patrick J. Schiltz, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, in St. Paul, described the experiences he and his wife had as partners in Faegre & Benson, a Minneapolis firm. "We were working constantly," he wrote in the Vanderbilt Law Review in 1999. "We were under constant pressure. We were constantly feeling guilty about hardships we were imposing on each other and our children. The life we were leading was not the life we envisioned."
At the time, their firm had won a judgment of more than $5 billion for the plaintiffs in the Exxon Valdez oil spill litigation, and its partners stood to get rich if the judgment were affirmed. (The litigation lives on.)
"We decided to leave big firm practice," Professor Schiltz said, "and to leave the Exxon money behind. We decided to give up a ton of money in return for work that was more enjoyable and less stressful."
In 1999, Professor Fortney of Texas Tech surveyed 1,000 associates in Texas law firms. Almost half agreed that billing pressure "causes ethical and competent attorneys to leave private law practice." Another third abstained from answering the question. "We're driving the wrong people out of private practice," Professor Fortney said. "We're driving out the ethical lawyers."

HEADLINE: THE JOB SEARCH; 
Coping With the Spiral of Stress That Layoffs Create

BYLINE:  By MARY DUENWALD 

 BODY:
ROBERT TODARO lost his job a year ago as a technical writer at General Dynamics. It was nothing personal, companywide layoffs, but the experience was "utterly devastating," said Mr. Todaro, 45, of Middleboro, Mass. "You feel as though you've done something wrong."
 In March, Mr. Todaro found a temporary job as a technical writer at Raytheon, but that ended a few months later, and he felt even worse. Raytheon has since hired him full time, but he has not forgotten what it was like to be without work. 
 "You worry about money," he said. "You worry about what's going to happen in the future. And it depresses you -- emotionally, physically, all sorts of ways."
Such mental health issues surrounding job loss are drawing more attention from psychologists. The vulnerability that a worker experiences after being laid off can undermine the ability to find the next job.
Dr. Richard H. Price, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, has found a pattern to the spiral: the layoff leads to financial insecurity, which sets off depression; that in turn causes people to feel they have little control over events. Next comes hopelessness and ultimately, sleeplessness, headaches, chronically upset stomachs and fatigue. "People tend to think that the big psychological shock of job loss happens at the first moment," said Dr. Price, who tracked 756 people for two years after they lost their jobs. "But it's the cascade of events that is triggered by it that causes greater and more lasting harm."
Even when people can avoid financial problems, they typically suffer some depression, Dr. Price said. "Some people," he said, "even after they get another job, have more trouble getting out of bed in the morning, talking with their boss, dealing with the demands of work."
In addition, becoming enthusiastic about job hunting can be difficult. "You don't even have to get up at any particular time," said Claire Logue, 45, of Barrington, Ill., who was laid off from a sales and marketing job at a golf club last June. "You have to make yourself buckle down."
Francis Kelley, 50, of Tewksbury, Mass., who was let go as an educational specialist at a computer software company in May 2001, said he could pinpoint the moments when he felt most down. One was a few weeks ago, when he received a letter from a mortgage company telling him that he was six months behind in paying real estate taxes on his house and on a rental property.
"Between that rental property and my savings, I've been able to maintain perfect credit through 15 months of unemployment," Mr. Kelley said. "But I'm running out of savings, and now I'm waking up in the middle of the night worrying."
The federal government reports that even as unemployment remains relatively low -- 5.6 percent in September -- the number of people without work for at least six months is rising. Last month, the figure was about 1.6 million, nearly double that of a year ago.
Career counselors say that their services for white-collar workers are needed now more than ever, thanks to the long-term unemployment situation. "Our numbers are up 228 percent over the same time last year," said Jane Laystrom, director of the Barrington Career Center, a nonprofit organization in Barrington, Ill.
One way to recover from the repercussions of unemployment, the experts say, is to become more adept at looking for work.
"One of the best things we can help people learn to do is to assess their own skills," Dr. Price said. He described an unemployed man who worked for years on the assembly line at Ford Motor and thought he had no other marketable skills. "After interviewing him, I learned that he had run the accounting service for the Boy Scouts of Southeast Michigan," Dr. Price said. "I pointed out that that gave him major managerial skills."
Martin Pierce, a consultant for the career management firm of R. L. Stevens & Associates, in Waltham, Mass., said that when jobless people focused on their strengths, "their self-esteem starts coming back, and they become more hopeful."
Learning interviewing techniques is also helpful, especially when people suffer from unemployment-related depression. "If you walk into an interview with your face down to your shoes, the employer's going to pick that up right away," said Bernard Margolis, a volunteer consultant at the Barrington Career Center, who has been unemployed for nine months. 
"When I'm going in for an interview, I psych myself up in the car, in the parking lot," Mr. Margolis said. "If I'm not smiling, I slap myself a few times and say, 'Look, we're here for business.' "
Reaching out to others can also be therapeutic. "The last thing you want to do is isolate yourself," said Bob Richard, executive director of the Career Counselors' Consortium, a nonprofit organization in Boston. "A lot of people will try to avoid situations where they have to answer the question, 'What do you do?' We recommend that you do the opposite: tell the world your story, and they'll help you make some decisions, come to conclusions."
Mr. Kelley, who holds bachelor degrees in computer science and electrical engineering and a master's in business administration, has learned that it is not enough to e-mail his resume to potential employers. "I haven't been on an interview in probably nine months," he said. "I'm beginning to see that I have to get out there and sell myself. I'm going to get names of people behind the scenes."
Networking groups, like the Barrington Career Center and WIND (Wednesday is Networking Day), throughout New England offer unemployed people a place to meet and hear advice from career counselors, psychologists and other specialists.
"You have to network, and you really have to control your emotions," Mr. Todaro said. "You have to be able to go back to the company that laid you off and say there's no hard feelings, be persistent and courteous and say, 'I'm still eager to work for you.' "
Mr. Todaro started last week at Raytheon again. He accepted a lower salary and an assignment overseas, which will separate him from his family for two years. 
"As time goes on," he said, "you lower your salary requirements and raise the miles you'll travel." Mr. Todaro is taking the job knowing that he could find himself in the labor market again. "No employment is permanent," he said. "I'm going to maintain contacts with all kinds of companies, in case something like this happens again."

HEADLINE: Don't Blame Columbus for All the Indians' Ills 

BYLINE:  By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
Europeans first came to the Western Hemisphere armed with guns, the cross and, unknowingly, pathogens. Against the alien agents of disease, the indigenous people never had a chance. Their immune systems were unprepared to fight smallpox and measles, malaria and yellow fever.
 The epidemics that resulted have been well documented. What had not been clearly recognized until now, though, is that the general health of Native Americans had apparently been deteriorating for centuries before 1492. 
 That is the conclusion of a team of anthropologists, economists and paleopathologists who have completed a wide-ranging study of the health of people living in the Western Hemisphere in the last 7,000 years. 
The researchers, whose work is regarded as the most comprehensive yet, say their findings in no way diminish the dreadful impact Old World diseases had on the people of the New World. But it suggests that the New World was hardly a healthful Eden.
More than 12,500 skeletons from 65 sites in North and South America -- slightly more than half of them from pre-Columbians -- were analyzed for evidence of infections, malnutrition and other health problems in various social and geographical settings.
The researchers used standardized criteria to rate the incidence and degree of these health factors by time and geography. Some trends leapt out from the resulting index. The healthiest sites for Native Americans were typically the oldest sites, predating Columbus by more than 1,000 years. Then came a marked decline.
"Our research shows that health was on a downward trajectory long before Columbus arrived," Dr. Richard H. Steckel and Dr. Jerome C. Rose, study leaders, wrote in "The Backbone of History: Health and Nutrition in the Western Hemisphere," a book they edited. It was published in August.
Dr. Steckel, an economist and anthropologist at Ohio State University, and Dr. Rose, an anthropologist at the University of Arkansas, stressed in interviews that their findings in no way mitigated the responsibility of Europeans as bearers of disease devastating to native societies. Yet the research, they said, should correct a widely held misperception that the New World was virtually free of disease before 1492.
In an epilogue to the book, Dr. Philip D. Curtin, an emeritus professor of history at Johns Hopkins University, said the skeletal evidence of the physical well-being of pre-Columbians "shows conclusively that however much it may have deteriorated on contact with the outer world, it was far from paradisiacal before the Europeans and Africans arrived."
About 50 scientists and scholars joined in the research and contributed chapters to the book. One of them, Dr. George J. Armelagos of Emory University, a pioneer in the field of paleopathology, said in an interview that the research provided an "evolutionary history of disease in the New World."
The surprise, Dr. Armelagos said, was not the evidence of many infectious diseases, but that the pre-Columbians were not better nourished and in general healthier.
Others said the research, supported by the National Science Foundation and Ohio State, would be the talk of scholarly seminars for years to come and the foundation for more detailed investigations of pre-Columbian health. Dr. Steckel is considering conducting a similar study of health patterns well into European prehistory.
"Although some of the authors occasionally appear to overstate the strength of the case they can make, they are also careful to indicate the limitations of the evidence," Dr. Curtin wrote of the Steckel-Rose research. "They recognize that skeletal material is the best comparative evidence we have for the human condition over such a long period of time, but it is not perfect."
The research team gathered evidence on seven basic indicators of chronic physical conditions that can be detected in skeletons -- namely, degenerative joint disease, dental health, stature, anemia, arrested tissue development, infections and trauma from injuries. Dr. Steckel and Dr. Rose called this "by far the largest comparable data set of this type ever created."
The researchers attributed the widespread decline in health in large part to the rise of agriculture and urban living. People in South and Central America began domesticating crops more than 5,000 years ago, and the rise of cities there began more than 2,000 years ago.
These were mixed blessings. Farming tended to limit the diversity of diets, and the congestion of towns and cities contributed to the rapid spread of disease. In the widening inequalities of urban societies, hard work on low-protein diets left most people vulnerable to illness and early death.
Similar signs of deleterious health effects have been found in the ancient Middle East, where agriculture started some 10,000 years ago. But the health consequences of farming and urbanism, Dr. Rose said, appeared to have been more abrupt in the New World.
The more mobile, less densely settled populations were usually the healthiest pre-Columbians. They were taller and had fewer signs of infectious lesions in their bones than residents of large settlements. Their diet was sufficiently rich and varied, the researchers said, for them to largely avoid the symptoms of childhood deprivation, like stunting and anemia. Even so, in the simplest hunter-gatherer societies, few people survived past age 50. In the healthiest cultures in the 1,000 years before Columbus, a life span of no more than 35 years might be usual.
In examining the skeletal evidence, paleopathologists rated the healthiest pre-Columbians to be people living 1,200 years ago on the coast of Brazil, where they had access to ample food from land and sea. Their relative isolation protected them from most infectious diseases.
Conditions also must have been salubrious along the coasts of South Carolina and Southern California, as well as among the farming and hunting societies in what is now the Midwest. Indian groups occupied the top 14 spots of the health index, and 11 of these sites predate the arrival of Europeans.
The least healthy people in the study were from the urban cultures of Mexico and Central America, notably where the Maya civilization flourished presumably at great cost to life and limb, and the Zuni of New Mexico. The Zuni lived at a 400-year-old site, Hawikku, a crowded, drought-prone farming pueblo that presumably met its demise before European settlers made contact.
It was their hard lot, Dr. Rose said, to be farmers "on the boundaries of sustainable environments."
"Pre-Columbian populations were among the healthiest and the least healthy in our sample," Dr. Steckel and Dr. Rose said. "While pre-Columbian natives may have lived in a disease environment substantially different from that in other parts of the globe, the original inhabitants also brought with them, or evolved with, enough pathogens to create chronic conditions of ill health under conditions of systematic agriculture and urban living."
In recent examinations of 1,000-year-old Peruvian mummies, for example, paleopathologists discovered clear traces of tuberculosis in their lungs, more evidence that native Americans might already have been infected with some of the diseases that were thought to have been brought to the New World by European explorers.
Tuberculosis bears another message: as an opportunistic disease, it strikes when times are tough, often overwhelming the bodies of people already weakened by malnutrition, poor sanitation in urban centers and debilitated immune systems.
The Steckel-Rose research extended the survey to the health consequences of the first contacts with American Indians by Europeans and Africans and the health of European-Americans and African-Americans up to the early 20th century.
Not surprisingly, African-American slaves were near the bottom of the health index. An examination of plantation slaves buried in South Carolina, Dr. Steckel said, revealed that their poor health compared to that of "pre-Columbian Indian populations threatened with extinction."
On the other hand, blacks buried at Philadelphia's African Church in the 1800's were in the top half of the health index. Their general conditions were apparently superior to those of small-town, middle-class whites, Dr. Steckel said.
The researchers found one exception to the rule that the healthiest sites for Native Americans were the oldest sites. Equestrian nomads of the Great Plains of North America in the 19th century seemed to enjoy excellent health, near the top of the index. They were not fenced in to farms or cities.
In a concluding chapter of their book, Dr. Steckel and Dr. Rose said the study showed that "the health decline was precipitous with the changes in ecological environments where people lived." It is not a new idea in anthropology, they conceded, "but scholars in general have yet to absorb it."

HEADLINE: BACK TO SCHOOL; 
New Skills, and Paying for Them

BYLINE:  By BONNIE ROTHMAN MORRIS 

 BODY:
SINCE the day she graduated from high school in 1965, Elaine Mitchell had never been out of work. But 14 months ago, the 55-year-old Stamford, Conn., resident was laid off from her job as a tape librarian at a multinational corporation, where she retrieved and cataloged data from the company's computer. She has been unemployed ever since. After a year into a job search, conducted from her personal computer at home, Ms. Mitchell realized that without a college degree or advanced computer skills, she "wasn't going to be hired," she said.
 "I knew I couldn't afford college, so I'm locked into going for certification," Ms. Mitchell said. This month, she started a program at a community college that will lead to certification in Web design. The course costs $2,395 and takes 130 hours to complete. 
 Career experts agree that in the current economy, workers -- including those who have jobs -- must constantly acquire new skills and knowledge to stay employable. "Training is critical to having a future," said Robin Ryan, a career counselor and the author of "What to Do With the Rest of Your Life." "Employers today want to hire people who are skilled and committed to learning and improving."
There are numerous resources to help people find out what kind of training is available and how to secure tuition aid to pay for it. The information is generally free, but the money for assistance is tight, and only the determined need apply.
In Ms. Mitchell's situation, it took months of red tape before she was approved for a $3,000 tuition grant from the Southwestern CTWorks, a career center in Bridgeport, Conn. CTWorks is one of 630 nonprofit groups across the country that were established in 1998 by the Workforce Investment Act. At the centers, unemployed and underemployed workers can apply for unemployment benefits, meet with career counselors and apply for "training scholarships" like the one Ms. Mitchell received. (For information, call 877-872-5627, or check www.servicelocator.org.)
Financing at the centers, distributed through the Department of Labor, is in ever-shorter supply. According to Scott K. Wilderman, the executive director of the WorkPlace Inc., a nonprofit organization that operates the Bridgeport center, 17,000 people use Southwestern CTWorks and only 500 tuition grants are available.
"The real dollar allocations to help dislocated workers are going down at the same time the number of people who are looking for services is going up," said Dr. Andrew Sum, the director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston. 
Many unions offer free training and education programs to their members, including those who are unemployed.
COMMUNITY colleges can also be sources for career information. "Community colleges see that as their job," said Kay McClenney, an adjunct professor of the community college leadership program at the University of Texas. Ms. McClenney said that community colleges receive state tuition aid, and they can help students apply for federal Pell grants for low-income students, as well as government loans.
With any education program, it is important to find out what the program costs and what you are getting for your money, the experts say. "Look before you waste your money," Ms. Ryan, the career counselor, said. "There are courses that say they are 'certified,' and they're not. Find out if they produce graduates that get jobs."
In addition, try to determine what you want and need. "Ask yourself: 'What kind of job am I looking for? What are my core skills? What kind of jobs are in the local area?' " said Marshall Goldberg, the executive director of the Association of Joint Labor-Management Educational Programs, a nonprofit organization in New York that provides training for unionized workers. 
In the case of Robert Sellars, a reassessment of his career led him to switch to another. Mr. Sellars, 36, of Fullerton, Calif., was laid off from his job selling plumbing supplies 18 months ago. Last month, his unemployment compensation ran out and he had only $1,000 in the bank. He then decided to go back to school to become a real estate appraiser. Using his credit card, he paid $900 to enroll in a course at the Anthony Schools in Irvine, Calif. After he passes a state exam, which will cost $650, he will get a trainee license in the profession. Then he must work for 2,000 hours as an apprentice with an appraiser before he is licensed in the state of California.
"It never occurred to me to get more education, said Mr. Sellars, who has a bachelor's dress in business administration. "I already had an education." 
He now subscribes to the theory that learning and job training are a lifelong process. So does Elaine Mitchell, who is hopeful that once she is certified in Web design, she will be more marketable should she face a second layoff. "If this happens again, it'll make it easier to go out and find another job," she said. Still, she intends to keep on learning new skills, just in case.

HEADLINE: TWO CITIES; 
In Georgia, Clues to A Puzzling Job Market

BYLINE:  By BERNARD STAMLER 

DATELINE: SAVANNAH, Ga. 

 BODY:
THEY live not much more than 100 miles apart as the crow flies. Last year, both were laid off by employers in the throes of downsizing. But for Bob Fowler and Cathy Bragg, things are very different nowadays.
 Mr. Fowler, 56, lives in Augusta, Georgia's second largest city. The Augusta metropolitan region had a net loss of nearly 5,000 jobs this year, through September; only five other cities lost jobs at a faster rate. 
 Ms. Bragg, 42, lives in Savannah, which saw a net gain of about 3,400 jobs over the same period in its metropolitan area; its job growth rate was the nation's fifth best. And more jobs are coming: earlier this month, Savannah was chosen over Summerville, S.C., as the site of a $700 million DaimlerChrysler van assembly plant that will employ as many as 3,000 workers. 
Mr. Fowler was laid off in December from Thermal Ceramics, which makes insulation and heat-retardant materials. Headquartered in Augusta, it employed up to 1,150 local people in 1999, according to the city's chamber of commerce. Today, that number is fewer than 600.
"I've tried everything I can think of to get work," said Mr. Fowler, who has exhausted his unemployment benefits. "But there isn't any."
Last May, Ms. Bragg lost her job as an administrative assistant at a paper mill owned by the International Paper Company, where she had worked for 17 years. She was one of many administrative and factory workers to be laid off this year at the mill. Long a mainstay of the local economy, it once employed more than 5,000 people; today, after a constant stream of layoffs, the total number of jobs is around 1,200.
Ms. Bragg, however, found a new, "good" job "within a few weeks," she said. She works at Memorial Health University Medical Center, one of two major hospitals in Savannah. Her job-seeking experience is not an exception, she said.
"Most everyone I know who was laid off now has a job," she said. "And that includes a lot of people who worked in the factory, too."
Two cities, two stories -- and a contrast that offers a clue into some of the most baffling aspects of the employment situation in America these days. Most economists say that the latest national recession ended close to a year ago; moreover, the overall unemployment rate never rose as sharply as it did in many past recessions. But the unemployment rate has not fallen since the recession's apparent end, either, and the problem of long-term unemployment remains persistent and widespread.
The reliable ways of analyzing joblessness -- often with generalizations about regions like the Rust Belt or the Sun Belt -- seem increasingly less apt. Instead, job loss and job growth are roughly stalemated in a checkerboard pattern across the nation, as employers of all sorts remain reluctant to hire.
Augusta and Savannah are far from the only pair of cities presenting tough times and better times side by side. A close look suggests that the idiosyncratic characteristics of each place often matter as much as the trends within the larger region that is their home. 
Certainly, that is the case with Savannah and Augusta. At one time, their economies were similar, dominated by industries like papermaking. But they have gone their separate ways.
Why? As older industries wane, the features that differentiated the two cities have become more important than what they have in common. Geography and access to transportation -- or the lack thereof -- make a difference in each city.
While Savannah and Augusta are located on the Savannah River, it is Savannah that lies along the Atlantic Coast, allowing it to have a deep-water port. And though Augusta has Interstate 20, which links it to Atlanta and Columbia, S.C., Savannah is on two interstates: Route 16, which connects to Atlanta, as well as Route 95, the main north-south highway in the eastern United States.
Unlike Augusta, which has a regional airport, Savannah has an international facility that also serves the golfing resort at Hilton Head, S.C., nearby, and is located between Route 95 and the port. The airport makes the city a "natural" magnet for new business, according to Eric R. Winger, the president and chief executive of the Savannah Economic Development Authority.
In the last few years, distribution centers for chains like Wal-Mart and Home Depot have opened in the area. Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, which makes business jets, has expanded near the airport. And that DaimlerChrysler plant is coming.
HISTORY and tourism also help determine a city's economic standing. Savannah was laid out in Colonial times, and its historic district buildings were developed in the 19th century. Through the efforts of local preservationists, many of the edifices remain; large numbers of tourists come to see them, sparked by "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" by John Berendt. The enormously popular account of intrigue about the city that spent years on the best-seller list in the 1990's is referred to here as The Book.
The tourist trade has prompted an increase in hotel construction, the building of a new convention center and a spike in service jobs, which comprise a third of all jobs in the city, according to Michael Toma, the director of the Center for Regional Analysis at Armstrong Atlantic State University in Savannah.
Restaurants and nightclubs have sprung up.; Il Pasticcio, a restaurant that opened downtown in 1993, employs about 60 people.
"People thought we were crazy when we started," said Pino Venetico, the restaurant's owner. "There was nothing here."
The city is also home to the Savannah College of Art and Design, which has grown in 24 years from 71 students to nearly 6,000. It owns or leases more than 50 buildings in the city, many of them properties the college renovated itself.
"We were probably the first to take the marriage of art and technology seriously," said Paula S. Wallace, the president and a co-founder, describing the college's intertwining of art and graphics. Course offerings include architecture and "the building arts," Ms. Wallace said.
That focus has spawned a cottage industry among graduates who choose to stay and work in the field of historic preservation in Savannah, where renovation and downtown renewal continue with vigor.
Christian Sottile is among them. He and his wife, Amy, graduates of the college, spent two years in Florence before returning to Savannah to open their own urban design firm three years ago. Their work has included the renovation of an entire block of houses on Brady Street downtown. "This city is a perfect place to operate," Mr. Sottile said. "It has its own urban tradition of spontaneity and unpredictability, and that has a lot to do with the kind of projects there are."
Yet, boarded-up houses and vacant storefronts abound in Savannah, and manufacturing firms are also downsizing. But there appear to be fewer empty storefronts downtown than there are in Augusta. And the layoffs in Augusta have generally been more significant, like those at the federally-owned Savannah River Site, a nuclear weapons plant in neighboring South Carolina, which employed as many as 30,000 people in the early 90's but now employs only about 13,500. Then there are companies like Thermal Ceramics, where Bob Fowler used to work.
Moreover, though the city has Augusta State University, there is no art school, historic district or other tourist attraction comparable to those of Savannah, except for the annual Masters Golf Tournament, played in April at the Augusta National Golf Course. While it is commonly said in Augusta's business community that the economic effect of the Masters is like "a 13th month," its true measure has never been taken, according to Adela Reddell, director of research for the Augusta Metro Chamber of Commerce, in part because of the difficulty in obtaining the data from the privately owned course. 
The city also suffers from the "perception that it is a racially polarized and divided community," said Dr. Ralph Walker, director of the Augusta State University Research Center. Augusta shares a consolidated government with Richmond County, where it is located, and where the number of white and black residents is roughly equal. According to Dr. Walker, the two communities distrust each other, at least politically. There have been frequent conflicts, some with racial overtones, among elected officials. 
As Dr. Walker said, "The city does not paint a great picture for businesses coming in."
Which is not to say that there is no positive news about Augusta's employment picture, or that Savannah is without problems. The Medical College of Georgia, in Augusta, is expanding its research center and may develop a so-called incubator for the biotechnology industry, according to Dr. Daniel W. Rahn, its president. Having reorganized a couple of years ago, the college has increased in size since it separated its functions administratively from those of the MCG Health System Hospitals and Clinics, the largest hospital in the city. Augusta is banking that MCG will bring a core of new business to town as the city's many hospitals continue to grow.
Fort Gordon, outside Augusta, is employing increasing numbers of military and civilian workers, especially as some of its main functions, like military intelligence and information technology, become more important after 9/11. There are about 17,000 personel at the site, according to Deputy Garrison Commander John Terence Smith, a substantial increase over last year.
OTHER promising signs exist for Augusta. This year, the value of new construction in the city through September rose to $87.3 million, according to Mayor Bob Young, an increase of about 10 percent over the same period last year. He called Augusta's economy a "mixed bag."
In Savannah, meanwhile, total employment was up but manufacturing jobs were down during the second quarter of this year, as were military jobs at Hunter Army Airfield and Fort Stewart. Service jobs increased, but the wages remained relatively low.
For the year 2000, annual wages in Savannah's tourism industry averaged only $14,700, as opposed to $16,500 for the rest of Georgia and $21,300 nationwide, according to Anthony Schopp, president of the Savannah Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Savannah is, in fact, a low-wage town in most industries; the median hourly management wage is $28.55, compared with $31.15 in Augusta and $37.25 in Atlanta.
Though the degree of racial tension in Savannah does not seem as great as it appears to be in Augusta, discrimination and low pay are factors that create problems, said Dr. Otis Johnson, the retired dean of liberal arts and social sciences at Savannah State University and a former member of Savannah's city council and current member of the Savannah-Chatham County Board of Education. 
"There is a kind of 'velvet racism' here," he said, "and a reluctance to talk about issues of race and class. It impacts blacks more heavily than whites, but there are a great many of them who are also affected." A result, he said, is "the invisible Savannah," 30,000 to 35,000 people who live below the poverty line, many of them working multiple, low-paying jobs.
Nevertheless, Dr. Johnson said that he believed Savannah was improving.
"Despite some unique challenges," said Mayor Young, he was optimistic about Augusta's future, especially regarding expansion at Fort Gordon and in the medical industry.
But these prospects offer scant comfort to Mr. Fowler. Because his wife still works in the Augusta area, they cannot move. With no ties to the military or to medicine, he still cannot find a job.
"Nobody is hiring," he said. "I don't know what I am going to do."

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB; 
Pilots Find Themselves Left Up in the Air

BYLINE:  By JULIE FLAHERTY 

 BODY:
AT the beginning of 2001, Dave Jewell was in demand as a pilot. Having flown jets for 20 years in the Air Force, he had offers from three airlines when he left the service. He happily accepted one from Delta Air Lines, moved his family to Atlanta from St. Louis and began flying MD-88's that June. 
 Then came Sept. 11, and everything changed. In mid-October, a letter arrived telling him he was furloughed indefinitely, meaning no flying and no pay. 
 More than a year later, Mr. Jewell, 44, is working three part-time jobs as he waits for a callback from Delta. He knows that a smaller airline would hire him, but he is afraid to give up his place at Delta, the third-largest American airline. "They don't want anyone just for a short-term period," he said. "Either you sign a contract, or you have to resign your seniority number. That's pretty risky." 
When Mr. Jewell goes to the airport, it is for his part-time job training baggage screeners. Though grateful for the work, he says, "there's certainly a part of you that when you see other pilots going out to the airplane to take off, you go, 'I wish I was there.' "
While his timing in joining a major airline could probably not have been worse, Mr. Jewell is hardly alone in his misfortune. A decline in passengers attributable to the economy and the terrorist attacks, an increase in competition from smaller, discount airlines and poor management have turned the airline industry into a less friendly place for pilots. 
After nearly a decade of quick promotions and rising salaries, the turmoil has caused many pilots to redraw their plans for what is widely viewed as a prestigious and glamorous career. At the end of September 2002, 7,080 pilots were furloughed, about 7.5 percent of the 94,571 pilots with airline jobs in the United States before the terrorist attacks, according to AIR Inc., a career counseling resource organization for pilots, in Atlanta. Furloughs were unheard of in 1999, when 82,790 United States pilots had steady jobs and the industry was hiring at a record pace. 
"They live with a degree of uncertainty about the future that I think is unique in the history of the industry," said George E. Hopkins, a professor at Western Illinois University and an expert on aviation history. 
US Airways is under bankruptcy court protection, and United Airlines is trying to avoid a filing, scrambling to obtain financing before mid-November, when a large debt payment is due. Then there are the two things Dr. Hopkins says American pilots are afraid of: "The JetBlues and the Southwests, and the threat of foreign competition." 
JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, two relative newcomers on the national level, are taking business away from the major airlines by flying a limited number of point-to-point routes, between cities like New York and Los Angeles or Washington and Chicago, and charging much lower fares than the bigger airlines, which serve both large and small markets with their hub-and-spoke systems, sometimes losing money on smaller routes.
The second concern is that the government will lift its restriction preventing foreign ownership of American airlines. American pilots, who are the highest paid in the world, are wary they will lose their jobs to foreign pilots, who typically work for less money. 
John Cox, a captain who flies an Airbus for US Airways, said that some pilots who were beginning their careers "went from pretty much being able to write their own ticket to having to take any job they've been offered."
The change has disillusioned many of those who started their careers in the 1990's, said John Mazor, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association. 
"Pilots who have been hired in the last 10 years or so are like the people who invested in the stock market at the beginning of that long golden age," he said. "You come to build the expectation that your stock should always give you double-digit returns. For those who moved rapidly up the ranks, made captain in a couple of years and so forth, I think they're getting a little sticker shock. They need to realize that there are going to be ups and downs."
He added: "We have pilots who come in and say, 'I just got furloughed. Can they do that?' "
The airline industry has had its cycles of pilot shortages and surpluses. The huge surplus of pilots after World War II, followed by three sharp recessions during the Eisenhower administration, depressed hiring for 20 years. The jet age of the 60's, a glory time for pilots, gave way to the Arab oil embargo of 1973, which led to a worldwide recession. But the 90's brought another boom for younger pilots, as those who started in the 1960's retired and commuter airlines joined the market.
Kit Darby, a United pilot who is president of AIR Inc., is confident that the current down cycle will pass. He has worked at five airlines and been furloughed as many times. Discount airlines, he said, "typically do well in this type of period and they don't do as well in a recovery period. Will they take over the business? Remember People Express? It didn't happen." (That discount airline was acquired by the Texas Air Corporation and merged with Continental in 1987.)
But for working pilots like Mike Pinho, 45, who flies Boeing 737-800's out of Atlanta for Delta, flight cutbacks are felt keenly. He may soon have to give up his captain's seat or move to a different market to keep his pay level -- pilots are paid for the hours they are in the cockpit; the bigger the plane, the higher the rate. 
"It's funny how this airline business works," Mr. Pinho said. "Even with 16 years of seniority with the airline, in my category I'm fairly junior. There is a very real chance I'll get bumped out of Atlanta and have to commute to New York to fly the same plane I'm on."
Most pilots, in fact, endure years of migrant living, erratic pay and sometimes painful choices. The experience of Bob Branyon is not unusual. When Mr. Branyon, 42, became a second officer for Delta in 1991, he was based in Atlanta but lived in Jacksonville, Fla., with his wife and three daughters. His base was quickly switched from Atlanta to Miami; from Miami to Dallas-Fort Worth; and from Dallas-Fort Worth to New York. Meanwhile, his family remained in Jacksonville while he commuted. Now, after more than 10 years with the airline, he has a job closer to home, as a 737 captain for Delta Express, the low-fare division, in Orlando, Fla. But that may change, too. 
"That's slated to shut down in the next year," he said of the Orlando operation, because the company will be flying larger planes out of that city. For Mr. Branyon, that most likely means a move to a new base, a new plane, a demotion to first officer and a pay cut.
Pilot salaries are also not as high, at least across the board, as many people think. The highest-paid captains earn as much as $300,000 a year, placing them among the best-paid hourly workers in the nation, but the averages are less impressive. According to the Air Line Pilots Association, a typical captain is 47 years old with 20 years of service, earning about $150,000 annually. The average first officer is 38 years old with 8 years of experience and a yearly salary of about $93,000. Entry-level salaries can be just a fraction of what a captain makes. At smaller airlines, a first officer may earn as little as $17,775 a year. 
IT is not uncommon for a new pilot to have a second job. Many, like Mr. Branyon, are in the military reserves.
"Even at major airlines, most military guys take a substantial pay cut in their first couple of years," said Mr. Pinho, a former Navy pilot. "Many of us have already started families at that point, so pay is an issue."
For Mr. Branyon, balancing the reserves and Delta is a juggling act that he performs every month, when he bids his "line" -- that is, submits his preference for routes and waits to hear as an airline computer system, based on seniority numbers, determines where to send him.
Mr. Darby of United and AIR Inc. says that a pilot will typically emphasize the positive side of his job. "He brags about working 80 hours a month, but he's actually gone away from home 340 hours, which is more than anyone even thinks of working," Mr. Darby said. "That's really the rub. You're gone a lot."
What about those exciting international routes to Paris and Tokyo? "At 35 that might be fun," he said. "At 45, it's bearable. At 55 it's excruciating." (Pilots are required to retire at age 60.) "If I had known how hard it was, I would probably still be in the Army," he said. 
Dave Jewell remains confident he will hear from Delta. But he admits that some colleagues who have been furloughed are less optimistic. 
"People are resuming their military careers," he said. "Some are going back to the jobs they used to have. There are those who say, 'This is all I've done and I've moved up and I can't get another job.' " They feel trapped, he said.
And there are one or two, according to Mr. Jewell, who say, " 'I'm wondering if it's just time to pack it in.' "

To the Senior Go the Spoils
THE axiom among pilots is that your career depends on three things: seniority, seniority, seniority. 
The day pilots are hired -- not the day they begin training or make their first flight for the airline -- primarily determines who gets to fly where and when and on what airplane.
The seniority system has historically acted as a protection against favoritism. "It goes back to the old airmail days," said Dr. George E. Hopkins, a history professor at Western Illinois University in Macomb. "If the weather was bad, management would say: 'Well, if you can't get the mail through, I'll get a pilot who can.' The rule is, don't overfly a brother pilot." 
But other factors can affect a career. For younger pilots, periodically changing aircraft is considered crucial for advancement. Each change, however, involves as much as eight weeks of training, often moving to a different home base and flying a different schedule. A pilot can reject a change. Indeed, some choose to fly smaller planes for less pay so they can stay closer to their homes and families, though such a decision would not affect the pilot's seniority.
Timing can be everything. John Cox, who flies an Airbus for US Airways, was hired in 1980 and made captain in just three years, mainly because expansions at the airline created openings. Mr. Cox said he "caught the wave at the right time." 
"There are first officers who have been this way 10, 12, 14 years, and it's nothing about their ability," he said. "There were just no captain spots open."
Bob Branyon has flown for Delta Air Lines for almost 11 years and is a captain but may have to relocate and become a first officer because his base, Orlando, Fla., will no longer need 737 pilots. 
For those like him, who are not senior enough to keep their current status, the flux in the industry is particularly challenging. With thousands of pilots on furlough, Mr. Branyon said, "People end up moving backwards." JULIE FLAHERTY

HEADLINE: THE JOB SEARCH; 
Soon-to-Be Graduates See the Need for Plan B

BYLINE:  By LAURA RANDALL 

 BODY:
HIEU LE, a business economics major at the University of California at Los Angeles, wants to land a job with a Big Four accounting firm when she graduates in May 2003.
 If that does not work out, she has a backup plan. She will take the Law School Admission Test in February and think about continuing her studies. So will many of her friends. 
 "We all have these safety nets in case we don't get hired," Ms. Le said as she balanced a stack of resumes and navigated her way around a career fair at the university. "I was hoping to get a job with a top accounting firm. Now I'm talking to everybody." 
On campuses nationwide, the slumping economy has led students like Ms. Le to reconsider their goals as they face a tough job market that leaves no room for signing bonuses or competing offers. 
While business remains the top major nationally, lower-profile programs like pharmacy and criminal justice are experiencing spikes in enrollment, officials say. Meanwhile, computer science, once a prelude to a fat paycheck and stock options, is experiencing its biggest drop in years at many colleges.
Students are choosing academic paths the same way a cautious investor buys a stock these days, said John A. Blackburn, the dean of admissions at the University of Virginia. "They're looking for more of a blue chip or something's that's going to run them through the turmoils and the ups and downs of the markets," he said.
Like the stock market, the job market may get worse before it gets better. The hiring of new college graduates is expected to fall 3.6 percent during the 2002-2003 school year, according to a survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, a research company in Bethlehem, Pa., that tracks employment of college graduates. Consulting businesses, which had an 89 percent drop in projected college recruitment from 2001 to 2002, expect some of the biggest cutbacks. The financial services sector, engineering firms and state and local governments are also projecting large hiring decreases.
On the other hand, the survey found that retailers, defense contractors and federal agencies plan to increase their employee rosters this academic year. Similarly, employers like the Central Intelligence Agency and the Internal Revenue Service are meriting second looks from a student population that once viewed them with suspicion. 
Since the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, the C.I.A. has received 136,000 applications from a wide range of students, retirees and professionals in midcareer. That's about double the number it received the year before the attacks, said Paul Nowack, the agency's spokesman.
While demand for expertise in difficult languages like Arabic and Farsi has become more robust, some professors suggest that enrollment increases in these areas are more a matter of normal growth than a result of recent global events. Columbia University, for example, has about 500 graduate and undergraduate students pursuing programs in Arabic languages and Islamic cultures this year, said George Saliba, the director of graduate studies in the department of Middle East and Asian languages and cultures. That's up from about 430 last year and 400 in the 2000-2001 school year, he said, adding that enrollment has been rising in the last five years.
"I think students have become less parochial in their thinking," said Kathy Sims, the director of the U.C.L.A. Career Center. "They're not as narrowly focused on one career option."
In some cases, that means pursuing broader liberal arts programs or accepting the fact that a business background may be more welcome in the marketing and buying departments of retail chains than among the investment houses of Wall Street.
At Ohio State University in Columbus, enrollment in liberal arts programs increased 4.5 percent this year. Interest in smaller programs like health care and pharmacy also experienced significant increases, said Mabel Freeman, the vice president of undergraduate admissions. 
"We went through a period in the 90's when people were questioning what to do with a liberal arts degree," Ms. Freeman said. "I think people are beginning to come out of that again and look at the fact that it's a broad education that can let you go in a number of directions."
Other students, like Ms. Le and her U.C.L.A. classmates, are flooding graduate and law schools with the highest number of applications seen in decades.
Law school applications are up 17.4 percent from last year, the biggest jump in 20 years, according to the Law School Admission Council. Other graduate programs are also undergoing a surge in interest. Columbia University's Graduate School of Business reported a 26 percent increase in applications this year, to about 7,400, from the year before. The University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education received 1,700 applications, a 50 percent increase over two years ago.
"Graduate enrollment tends to move with the unemployment rate," said Peter Syverson, the vice president of research at the Council of Graduate Schools. "Students see it as a way to wait out the economic downturn and come out of it with better credentials."
Another pattern emerging at some colleges is the revamping of traditionally stalwart programs like accounting and computer science. In the wake of scandals at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco International and other corporations, demand for classes about corporate governance and fraud have shot up in accounting programs across the country, professors say. 
While overall enrollment in accounting as a major fell 25 percent between 1996 and 2000, interest in the subject moved up about 7 percent in 2001, according to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The rise was partly a result of the economic downturn, which has motivated students to seek out fields where job availability is relatively steady, said Steve Goldfarb, a spokesman for the institute. If the upswing continues, however, the increase might also be attributed to the attention on the accounting industry over the last year.
"We're hearing anecdotally from administrators that this has increased awareness of the profession and has had something to do with the increased enrollment," Mr. Goldfarb said.
Some schools have introduced a multidisciplinary major that incorporates accounting with criminal justice and computer science. Hilbert College, a small liberal arts college in Hamburg, N.Y., put official enrollment estimates at 60 students when it introduced its economic-crime-investigation major three years ago. Today, 147 students are in the program, according to Sandra Augustine, the department chairwoman.
"It's an area where people are really starting to jump on the bandwagon," Ms. Augustine said. "With all the accounting fraud going on, it's just made our job a little easier."
Computer science departments are also exploring cross-disciplinary programs that focus on security issues that have developed since last year's terrorist attacks, said Stuart Zweben, the chairman of Ohio State University's department of computer and information science and a board member of the Computing Research Association, a Washington nonprofit group that tracks and promotes computer science trends.
"There's interest on the part of a lot of universities in increasing their relevance and expertise in this area," he said. "Security has a lot of components to it and could involve many areas of the campus, from psychology to law and criminology."
At Ohio State, the number of incoming computer science majors fell 10 percent this year. Mr. Zweben estimates that many colleges are encountering declines of 10 to 30 percent, although he says the drop-off is not uniform across campuses, as was the surge in computer science enrollment in the late 90's.
"It used to be they basically would just wave their degree and people would scarf them up," Mr. Zweben said. "Now they just have to look more diligently to find work." 
Across disciplines, students seem to be taking the message to heart.
Jennifer Cooke, a senior at U.C.L.A., is a former computer science major who switched to math management last year because she thought finance would be more stable. She showed up at the university's recent career fair wearing pressed trousers and a collared blouse and presenting a can-do expression at every financial services booth.
"I came here as a freshman in jeans and a T-shirt," Ms. Cooke said with a laugh. "Now look at me."

HEADLINE: THE JOB SEARCH; 
Big Job Sites Try to Think Small

BYLINE:  By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
LIKE many products of the technology boom, online job boards have not exactly gone bust, but they are reinventing themselves. Many are evolving from sites where jobs and resumes were posted into "career management" sites that offer expanded services and a more hands-on approach to matching job seekers and employers.
 During the 1990's, as the Internet promised to streamline things like job searches and hiring, numerous Web sites emerged that gave employers and job seekers access to databases of resumes and job listings. While comprehensive, this method was impersonal. And though volume has advantages, the sheer number of candidates can leave employers feeling overwhelmed. 
 After the dot-com implosion of 2000, many online job boards folded. Those that remained have retrenched, scaling back in some areas, branching out in others and searching for new business models.
Some sites, including Webhire, an applicant-tracking service based in Lexington, Mass., moved their focus from the hard-hit technology sector toward sectors that were still hiring, like health care.
Other sites, including BrassRing, a jobs board with an emphasis on technology professionals, devised fee services, like creating specialized talent pools of candidates for recruiters awash in resumes.
"Recruiters are completely stressed out," said Robin L. Rasmussen, executive vice president of services for BrassRing. BrassRing recently expanded its services to include candidate assessment and ranking, tasks that are usually done by human resources departments.
Monster, the largest jobs board, with 13.3 million visits in September, is refocusing its national television advertising on employers rather than on job seekers. A new advertising campaign is aimed at small businesses, which continue to hire even while large companies are laying off workers.
At no cost to the applicant, job boards encourage those eager for work to post resumes, which are consolidated into databases. Corporate and independent recruiters typically pay for access to the database. This model still holds, though fees have been dropping and most sites are searching for new sources of revenue, especially because their other main source of revenue, advertising, has also been dwindling.
Despite having access to databases with millions of resumes, some recruiters find general job boards inefficient. David B. Kamowski, who recruits health care technology professionals at the executive search firm Witt/Kieffer in Oak Brook, Ill., switched from mainstream job boards to two boards operated by professional groups, which send their members e-mail notices of new job listings. Now, Mr. Kamowski said, about 15 percent of people who respond to a job posting have the right skills, compared with the 2 percent results he was getting at mainstream job boards.
Applicants, too, are frustrated with the post-and-wait job-board experience, especially because the wait has become so much longer. "For the last 13 years, it's been easy to find a job," said Thomas P. Casey, 47, a technical writer from Laguna Beach, Calif. "Things have dried up. I wasn't prepared for that."
When demand was stronger, Mr. Casey said, employers would at least consider candidates who met half the wish list of qualifications they posted online. 
"Now," he said, "they get a blizzard of resumes. They can hold out for all 12 bells."
TO appeal to job seekers, job boards are offering services tailored specifically to them. Monster offers job hunters the ability to keep their resumes among the most current listings, for a fee. This presumably increases an applicant's visibility because the software used by recruiters typically looks for the most recent entries. Other sites offer career coaching and resume-writing services for a fee.
HotJobs, the second-largest jobs board with 4.4 million monthly visits, is also trying to solidify connections to job seekers. Acquired by Yahoo earlier this year, Hotjobs will soon be more visible on Yahoo's search engine, which reaches 84 million people monthly. About 20 percent of Yahoo e-mail accounts are held by people who want a private mailbox for a job search, said Daniel J. Finnigan, the executive vice president and general manager of HotJobs.
"I'm less interested in getting HotJobs icons everywhere than in getting more registered Yahoo users to tell us their occupations," he said.
The intent, Mr. Finnigan said, is to develop a database of Yahoo users who are already employed and are not actively seeking work but are interested in news about job opportunities. "We need to make sure it is as convenient as checking your e-mail and stocks," Mr. Finnigan said.

HEADLINE: The Mood at Work: Anger and Anxiety 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
THE ebullient mood of American workers during the 1990's boom has evaporated over the last two years, a victim of recession, rising unemployment, a hobbled stock market and scandals at WorldCom, Enron and other corporations.
 In its place, workers are feeling an anxiety that takes many forms, according to numerous surveys and interviews with employees and labor-market experts. Workers who were confident that they would climb the corporate ladder now often worry that their companies will implode like Enron and that they, too, will suddenly find themselves unemployed. Many baby boomers who were looking forward to a prosperous early retirement have been forced to rethink that dream. 
 Some employees are questioning whether it is worth going the extra mile when asked by senior executives because, as the WorldCom scandal demonstrated, some executives are looking out for themselves, not their corporations. 
For the first time in two decades, most workers surveyed said they would vote to join a union if they could, looking to unions as a way to gain coveted protections on the job.
And a New York Times/CBS News Poll found that American workers were more anxious about the economy than at any time since 1993. A survey of 668 Americans conducted from Oct. 3 to 5 found that 56 percent of Americans considered the economy fairly bad or very bad. Thirty-nine percent said they thought the economy would get worse, 46 percent expected the economy to remain the same and 13 percent predicted it would get better. This pessimism was fed by numerous factors, including the corporate scandals, lingering effects of the Sept. 11 attacks, Wall Street's woes and worries about a war with Iraq. 
With 70 percent of respondents saying the economy is worse than two years ago, this pessimism has influenced feelings about job security. Slightly more than half of those polled said they were very or somewhat concerned that in the next year they or someone in their household might be out of work or looking for a job.
All this anxiety comes during an unusual downturn. While most economists say the recession ended early this year, job growth continues to be minimal. And some economists expect the anxiety to endure even when growth picks up because many workers, already feeling fragile from the previous decade of downsizing, are deeply shaken by the wave of corporate scandals and by the end of the long Wall Street boom.
"Americans are feeling much less secure about their own job futures," said Carl Van Horn, director of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. "Even during the height of the 1990's boom, workers were expressing some anxiety about their jobs because of the rapid churning of the labor market, through things like downsizing. But now that a real recession occurred, people are more nervous than before. People are also much more concerned about their own retirement security, not only because of the corporate scandals but because they have seen their 401(k)'s get smaller."
Linda Guyer, a project manager for I.B.M. in Endicott, N.Y., said that fellow workers had grown more uneasy because of layoffs. "In the early 90's, when I.B.M. let people go, there were one or two massive layoffs and then you knew it was over," she said. "Now it's every quarter. You hear of someone let go in San Jose or Raleigh. They're spreading it out. You never know when you're going to be hit."
In a poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last spring by the Heldrich Center and the Center for Survey Research and Analysis at the University of Connecticut, 58 percent of those polled said they thought it was a bad time to find a good job. 
That has been the story for Geoff Cross of Lincoln, Neb., who has been unemployed for a year, having operated a travel agency that closed, largely because airlines kept reducing commissions.
"There are not a whole lot of nonentry-level positions available," Mr. Cross, 44, said. "The only jobs in the paper are telemarketing and McDonald's. Basically, I'm living in my mom's basement right now and my savings are just about gone."
While worker insecurity is high in troubled industries like telecommunications and airlines, not everyone is worried about layoffs.
Pamela Smith, 52, a retired hairdresser from Dothan, Ala., said: "My husband is in advertising and marketing, and they're talking about moving him up. They're in the grocery business, and they have picked up so much business that they're expanding. One thing people have to do is eat."
In a strong departure from the 1990's, when C.E.O.'s were often hailed as heroes, workers are voicing a sense of anger, even betrayal, toward top executives. Among experts in human resources, a sharp debate is under way about whether workers' commitment to their employers has waned in response to corporate downsizing and a sense that many top executives have betrayed workers and investors. 
According to the Rutgers-University of Connecticut poll, 58 percent of workers think that most top executives are interested only in looking out for themselves, even if it harms their company, while 33 percent think top executives are interested in doing a good job for their company.
Ilene Gochman, director of organization surveys for Watson Wyatt, a consulting firm specializing in human resources, said that surveys by her firm had also found decreased confidence and trust in corporations and management.
And in a poll of 900 people in August by Peter D. Hart Research, 60 percent of the respondents said employers fell short "in showing concern for employees, not just for the financial bottom line" and 57 percent said employers fell short in "being loyal to long-term employees."
BILL WALTERS shares this harsh view of the corporate hierarchy. After working for WorldCom for 18 years, Mr. Walters lost his job as an information technology specialist on June 28, one of 5,100 WorldCom workers who were laid off that day as an accounting scandal rocked the company. 
His 401(k) plan, which was loaded with WorldCom shares, has lost more than $300,000. And citing its bankruptcy court filing, WorldCom paid him only $4,600 of the $22,000 in severance that was promised. 
"I was very naive, and I just thought that if you did what you were supposed to do, then your employer was going to take care of you," said Mr. Walters, a 48-year-old Dallas resident. 
"I think there's a general attitude among high-level executives that they're above the law," he said. "It's hard to explain to my 12-year-old what the difference is between what a bank robber does and what one of these senior executives did."
His family is staying afloat because of his wife's job as a reservations clerk with Southwest Airlines. Mr. Walters applied for a job teaching computer applications at a Gateway store, but he was not surprised when he did not get the job -- 600 people applied.
"It's very difficult to find a job unless I want to go to work for Home Depot, and I'm not too far away from that," he said. 
Wanda Chalk recently landed a job in Houston with a payroll services company after being laid off by Enron, where she had worked for 15 years. "I find it very hard to believe that there is any job security anywhere," Ms. Chalk said. "It's kind of hard to believe that anymore."
She lost more than $70,000 in Enron stock and as a result could not afford to send her son to the four-year colleges that had accepted him. Instead, he began this fall at a community college.
These negative attitudes may hurt corporations whether or not they have been touched by scandal. "That kind of skepticism is very corrosive," Professor Van Horn said, "because the trend in the last half decade or more has been company leaders' ratcheting up expectations for their work force to be more productive, work harder and longer. 
"At the same time that they're asking people to make sacrifices, some of these executives were feeding at the trough to enrich themselves," he said. "This has a negative effect in terms of people's commitment, loyalty, willingness to go the extra mile."
Ms. Gochman says she thinks that workers' uneasiness is limiting their ability to act on their anger, at least for now. She cited her firm's surveys showing that employees' commitment to their employers remained unchanged even as their trust in management had declined.
"When you don't see a change in commitment, it doesn't mean that the emotional side of things is unchanged," she said. "What's more likely is they're saying: 'My 401(k) has fallen. I know I won't be able to get another job.' It's, 'I need to stay here, not that I want to stay.' "
Many workers, she said, feel their employers have violated their trust, by cutting the company match in their 401(k) plans or instituting a less-generous pension plan.
"Trust with an employer isn't much different from a romantic relationship," Ms. Gochman said. "Once trust is broken, people will look elsewhere to see whether they can find a better relationship."
She said that because so many workers were embittered, once the economy picks up, "we have a potential to see massive job exodus with people switching companies." 
Ms. Gochman had advice for companies that might be threatened with such an exodus. She said managers should identify the top performers and work to build the emotional commitment those employees have to the company "so they're not the first ones to bolt when things get better."
Garrett Lanzy, a software engineer for I.B.M., said that the upheaval and layoffs at his company and across corporate America had undermined employee loyalty. Mr. Lanzy, 40, who works in Rochester, Minn., said, "People tell themselves, 'If this is happening, then there's a good chance it will happen to me in the future, so there's no reason for me to put in a whole lot extra.' "
But he said he was working harder than before, noting that he had to assume some of the responsibilities of four people who had been laid off. 
And Stephen Vivien, a carrier management specialist with WorldCom in San Francisco, said that the day-to-day commitment of many employees had not been affected by the anger they felt toward several ousted executives.
"I can transcend my view that these guys at the top weren't looking out for me," he said. "A lot of people believe in the mission of the company to such a degree that that's what motivates us. It's almost like a kid, and the mom and dad are screwed up. The dad has a drinking problem, and the mom is leaving them, and the kids just keep charging forward."

HEADLINE: Sales of Video Games and Movies Increase Profit at Sony 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
The Sony Corporation is showing a growing knack for wringing profits from its most important market, the United States, even when it cannot find much sales growth there. The company announced today a much larger profit for the quarter ended Sept. 30 than analysts had expected. But it said that sales in the period were flat and were not likely to grow as much as hoped for the full year.
 Sony and its rivals in the Japanese electronics industry have rebounded this year after a disastrous 2001, because consumers in North America and Asia have been buying digital cameras, flat screen televisions and other products at a faster clip. But Sony's strength in the latest quarter is largely because of its success in two businesses that rivals like Matsushita Electric Industrial and Hitachi do not share: video game consoles and movies. 
 Sony is also benefiting from its concentration on the United States, where it gets more than a third of its sales, more than any of its Japanese rivals. But by the same token, growing worries that the American economy will slip back into recession have led Sony to revise its targets for its fiscal year, ending March 31.
The Japanese manufacturers have also been stung by a lockout of dockworkers on the American West Coast, which froze shipments of components and finished products for nine days. Matsushita, known for its Panasonic brand, had to airlift parts to the United States earlier this month.
Sony ships about 80 percent of its United States-bound products by boat. But its most profitable products, including digital cameras and hand-held digital organizers, go by air, and they have sold well in the United States.
As a result, though overall sales grew just 0.5 percent in the latest quarter, to 1.79 trillion yen ($14.48 billion), Sony was able to post 44 billion yen ($352 million) in net income. Analysts had on average been expecting only about 17 billion yen. The company posted a small loss in the comparable quarter a year ago.
Sony said today that it now had similar expectations for the full fiscal year: more profit than it had thought, on less sales. It raised its forecast for net income by 20 percent to 180 billion yen ($1.4 billion), citing gains expected from integrating a subsidiary, Aiwa. But it cut 100 billion yen ($800 million), or 1.3 percent, off its sales forecast, even though it expects the yen to weaken against the dollar, which would tend to increase its revenue in yen terms.
"There are heightened uncertainties about the state of the economy, so we have taken a conservative approach and are forecasting more difficult conditions compared with our forecasts made this past summer," said Teruhisa Tokunaka, Sony's chief financial officer.
Analysts say Sony's wider range of products and businesses position it to weather another economic downturn better than competitors can. The game business is an important ingredient: Sony said it expected to ship 22.5 million PlayStation2 consoles for the fiscal year, a 24.3 percent increase, mainly because of lower prices. In the United States, sales of software for the consoles more than doubled in the quarter from the period last year. Sony said it planned to start selling the PlayStation 2 in China next year.
Sony's movie division has also done well, with hits like "Spider-Man" and "Men in Black II"; movie revenue rose 27 percent from a year earlier.
These successes have apparently softened the effects of general investor pessimism abut technology companies on Sony's stock, which has fallen only 14.6 percent this year, half as far as its rivals on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, analysts said. The company's American depository receipts rose $1.28 to $45.08.
"Sony's visibility is pretty low, but my gut feeling tells me things will be O.K. in terms of what's selling well in the United States, like high-end televisions, computer games and digital videodiscs," said Richard Chu, who covers Sony for ING Securities in Tokyo.
Mr. Chu, like other analysts, has hesitated to raise his forecast for Sony because of the economic uncertainty in the United States.

HEADLINE: A New View Of Our Universe: Only One of Many 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS OVERBYE

 BODY:
Astronomers have gazed out at the universe for centuries, asking why it is the way it is. But lately a growing number of them are dreaming of universes that never were and asking, why not? 
 Why, they ask, do we live in 3 dimensions of space and not 2, 10 or 25? Why is a light ray so fast and a whisper so slow? Why are atoms so tiny and stars so big? Why is the universe so old? Does it have to be that way, or are there places, other universes, where things are different? 
 Once upon a time (only a century ago), a few billion stars and gas clouds smeared along the Milky Way were thought to encompass all of existence, and the notion of understanding it was daunting -- and hubristic -- enough. Now astronomers know that galaxies are scattered like dust across the cosmos. And understanding them might require recourse to an even broader canvas, what they sometimes call a "multiverse." 
For some cosmologists, that means universes sprouting from one another in an endless geometric progression, like mushrooms upon mushrooms upon mushrooms, or baby universes hatched inside black holes. 
For example, Dr. Max Tegmark, a University of Pennsylvania cosmologist, has posited at least four different levels of universes, ranging from the familiar (impossibly distant zones of our own universe) to the strange (space-times in which the fundamental laws of physics are different).
Dr. Martin Rees, a University of Cambridge cosmologist and the Astronomer Royal, said contemplating these alternate universes could help scientists distinguish which features of our own universe are fundamental and necessary and which are accidents of cosmic history. "It's all science, but science for the 21st century, to seek the answers to these questions," Dr. Rees said, adding that he is often accused of believing in other universes. 
"I don't believe," he said, "but I think it's part of science to find out."
Some cosmologists now say the realm we call the observable universe -- roughly 14 billion light-years deep of galaxies and stars -- could be only a small patch of a vast bubble or "pocket" in a much vaster ensemble bred endlessly in a chain of big bangs.
The idea, they say, is a natural extension of the theory of inflation, introduced by Dr. Alan Guth, now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 1980. That theory asserts that when the universe was less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old it underwent a brief hyperexplosive growth spurt fueled by an antigravitational force embedded in space itself, a possibility suggested by theories of modern particle physics.
Because inflation can grow a whole universe from about an ounce of primordial stuff, Dr. Guth likes to refer to the universe as "the ultimate free lunch." But Dr. Guth and various other theorists -- including Dr. Andrei Linde of Stanford, Dr. Alexander Vilenkin of Tufts and Dr. Paul Steinhardt of Princeton -- have suggested that it may be an endless one as well. Once inflation starts anywhere, it will keep happening over and over again, they say, spawning a chain of universes, bubbles within bubbles, in a scheme that Dr. Linde called "eternal inflation."
"Once you've discovered it's easy to make a universe out of an ounce of vacuum, why not make a bunch of them?" asked Dr. Craig Hogan, a cosmologist at the University of Washington.
In fact, Dr. Guth said, "Inflation pretty much forces the idea of multiple universes upon us."
Moreover, there is no reason to expect that these universes will be identical. Even within our own bubble, tiny random nonuniformities in the primordial raw material would cause the cosmos to look different from place to place. If the universe is big enough, Dr. Tegmark and others say, everything that can happen will happen, so that if we could look out far enough we would eventually discover an exact replica of ourselves.
Moreover, cosmologists say, the laws of physics themselves, as experienced by creatures like ourselves, confined to four dimensions and the energy scales of ordinary life, could evolve differently in different bubble universes.
"Geography is a now a much more interesting subject than you thought," Dr. John Barrow, a physicist at the University of Cambridge, observed.
Inflation has gained much credit with cosmologists, despite its strangeness, Dr. Guth noted, because it plays a vital role in calculations of the Big Bang that have been vindicated by the detection of the radio waves it produced. The prediction of other universes must therefore be taken seriously, he said.

Lucky Numbers
Adjusting the Dials Of Nature's Console
The prospect of this plethora of universes has brought new attention to a philosophical debate that has lurked on the edges of science for the last few decades, a debate over the role of life in the universe and whether its physical laws are unique -- or, as Einstein once put it, "whether God had any choice."
Sprinkled through the Standard Model, the suite of equations that describe all natural phenomena, are various mysterious constants, like the speed of light or the masses of the elementary particles, whose value is not specified by any theory now known.
In effect, the knobs on nature's console have been set to these numbers. Scientists can imagine twiddling them, but it turns out that nature is surprisingly finicky, they say, and only a narrow range of settings is suitable for the evolution of complexity or Life as We Know It.
For example, much of the carbon and oxygen needed for life is produced by the fusion of helium atoms in stars called red giants.
But a change of only half a percent in the strength of the so-called strong force that governs nuclear structure would be enough to prevent those reactions from occurring, according to recent work by Dr. Heinz Oberhummer of Vienna University of Technology. The result would be a dearth of the raw materials of biology, he said.
Similarly, a number known as the fine structure constant characterizes the strength of electromagnetic forces. If it were a little larger, astronomers say, stars could not burn, and if it were only a little smaller, molecules would never form.
So is this a lucky universe, or what?
In 1974, Dr. Brandon Carter, a theoretical physicist then at Cambridge, now at the Paris Observatory in Meudon, pointed out that these coincidences were not just luck, but were rather necessary preconditions for us to be looking at the universe.
After all, we are hardly likely to discover laws that are incompatible with our own existence.
That insight is the basis of what Dr. Carter called the anthropic principle, an idea that means many things to many scientists. Expressed most emphatically, it declares that the universe is somehow designed for life. Or as the physicist Freeman Dyson once put it, "The universe in some sense must have known that we were coming."
This notion horrifies some physicists, who feel it is their mission to find a mathematical explanation of nature that leaves nothing to chance or "the whim of the Creator," in Einstein's phrase.
"It touches on philosophical issues that scientists oftentimes skirt," said Dr. John Schwarz, a physicist and string theorist at the California Institute of Technology. "There should be mathematical ways of understanding how nature works."
Dr. Steven Weinberg, the University of Texas physicist and Nobel laureate, referred to this so-called "strong" version of the anthropic principle as "little more than mystical mumbo jumbo" in a recent article in The New York Review of Books.

Sorting Universes
Finding a Home For the 'A-Word'
Nevertheless, the "A-word" is popping up more and more lately, at conferences and in the scientific literature, often to the groans of particle physicists. The reason is the multiverse.
"It is possible that as theoretical physics develops, that it will present us with multiple universes," Dr. Weinberg said.
If different laws or physical constants prevail in other bubble universes, the conditions may not allow the existence of life or intelligence, he explained.
In that case the anthropic principle loses its mysticism and simply becomes a prescription for deciding which bubbles are capable of supporting life.
But many string theorists still resent the principle as an abridgment on their ambitions. The result has been a spirited debate about what physicists can expect from their theories.
"They have the pious hope that string theory will uniquely determine all the constants of nature," said Dr. Barrow, who wrote the 1984 book "The Cosmological Anthropic Principle" with Dr. Frank Tipler, a Tulane University physicist. The book argued that once life emerges in the universe it will never die.
In a recent paper titled "The Beginning of the End of the Anthropic Principle," three physicists -- Dr. Gordon Kane of the University of Michigan, and Dr. Malcolm Perry and Dr. Anna Zytkow, both of Cambridge -- argued that a unified theory of physics, as string theory purports to be, when finally formulated, would specify most of the constants of nature or specify relationships between them, leaving little room for anthropic arguments.
"The anthropic principle isn't as anthropic as people wanted," Dr. Kane said in an interview.
But in a rejoinder titled "Why the Universe Is Just So," Dr. Hogan of Washington argued that physics was replete with messy processes like quantum effects, which leave some aspects of reality and the laws of physics to chance.
According to string theory, he pointed out, the laws of physics that we mortals experience are low-energy, 4-dimensional shadows, of sorts, of a 10- or 11-dimensional universe. As a result, the so-called "fundamental constants" could look different in different bubbles.
Dr. Hogan admitted that this undermined some of the traditional aspirations of physics, writing, "at least some properties of the world might not have an elegant mathematical explanation, and we can try to guess which ones these are."
Even string theorists like Dr. Kane admit that, in the absence of a final form of the theory, they have no idea how many solutions there may be -- one, many or even an infinite number -- to the "final" string equations. Each one would correspond to a different condition of space-time, with a different set of physical constants. 
"Any set that allows life to happen will have life," he said.

Dark Energies
When the Numbers Just Don't Add Up
But even some of the most hard-core physicists, including Dr. Weinberg, suggest they may have to resort to the anthropic principle to explain one of the deepest mysteries looming like a headache over science: the discovery that the expansion of the universe seems to be speeding up, perhaps in a kind of low-energy reprise of an inflation episode 14 billion years ago.
Cosmologists suspect a repulsion or antigravity associated with space itself is propelling this motion. This force, known as the cosmological constant, was first proposed by Einstein back in 1917, and has been a problem ever since -- "a veritable crisis," Dr. Weinberg has called it.
According to astronomical observations, otherwise undetectable energy -- "dark energy" -- accounts for about two-thirds of the mass-energy of the universe today, outweighing matter by two to one. But according to modern quantum physics, empty space should be seething with energy that would outweigh matter in the universe by far, far more, by a factor of at least 1060 . This mismatch has been called the worst discrepancy in the history of physics.
But that mismatch is crucial for life, as Dr. Weinberg first pointed out in 1987. At the time there was no evidence for a cosmological constant and many physicists presumed that its magnitude was in fact zero.
In his paper, Dr. Weinberg used so-called anthropic reasoning to pin the value of any cosmological constant to between about one-tenth and a few times the density of matter in the universe. If it were any larger, he said, the universe would blow apart before galaxies had a chance to form, leaving no cradle for the stellar evolution of elements necessary for life or other complicated structures.
The measured value of the constant is about what would be expected from anthropic arguments, Dr. Weinberg said, adding that nobody knows enough about physics yet to tell whether there are other universes with other constants. He called the anthropic principle "a sensible approach" to the cosmological constant problem.
"We may wind up using the anthropic principle to satisfy our sense of wonder about about why things are the way they are," Dr. Weinberg said.

Beyond the Dark
Searching for Proof From Better Theories
For Dr. Rees, the Astronomer Royal, it is not necessary to observe other universes to gain some confidence that they may exist. One thing that will help, he explained, is a more precise theory of how the cosmological constant may vary and how it will affect life in the universe. We should live in a statistically typical example of the range of universes compatible with life, he explained. For example, if the cosmological constant was, say, 10 percent of the maximum value consistent with life, that would be acceptable, he said.
"If it was a millionth, that would raise eyebrows."
Another confidence builder would be more support for the theory of inflation, either in the form of evidence from particle physics theory or measurements of the cosmic Big Bang radiation that gave a more detailed model of what theoretically happened during that first trillionth of a trillionth of a second.
"If we had a theory then we would know whether there were many big bangs or one, and then we would know if the features we see are fixed laws of the universe or bylaws for which we can never have an explanation," Dr. Rees said.
In a talk last month at a cosmology conference in Chicago, Dr. Joseph Polchinski, from the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California in Santa Barbara, speculated that the there could be 1060 different solutions to the basic string equations, thus making it more likely that at least one universe would have a friendly cosmological constant.
Reminded that he had once joked about retiring if a cosmological constant was discovered, on the ground that the dreaded anthropic principle would be the only explanation, he was at first at a loss for words.
Later he said he hoped the range of solutions and possible universes permitted by string theory could be narrowed by astronomical observations and new theoretical techniques to the point where the anthropic principle could be counted out as an explanation.
"Life is still good," he said.
But Dr. Hogan said that multiple universes would have to be taken seriously if they came out of equations that science had faith in.
"You have to be open-minded," he said. "You can't impose conditions."
"It's the most scientific attitude," he added.

(Frank Curry for The New York Times); (Jonathan Player for The New York Times)(pg. F4) Chart/Diagram: "A Self-Reproducing Cosmos"Many cosmologists theorize that a brief burst of "inflation" -- expansionfueled by an antigravity force during the Big Bang -- shaped our universe.If so, some say, other bursts could spawn other universes. ETERNAL CREATIONScientists call the network of branching bubble universes the "multiverse." It could continue forever. A BUBBLE CALLED HOMEAccording to inflation theory, what we can see of the universe is only a tiny of space -- 30 billion light-years across -- on a "bubble" trillions of light-years across or more. Beyond our view, but in principle accessible, are vast reaches of space governed by the same natural laws. Because we can only see light has had time to travel, anyone out there would only be able to see similar-size zone. The forces and particles that define nature might vary from bubble to bubble affecting the properties of stars. Life might not be possible in many bubbles. A new big bang leads to formation of a new universe.(pg.

HEADLINE: The Connecticut Elections; 
Bill Curry for Governor

 BODY:
Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut is seeking a third term as chief executive in a contest against Bill Curry, a Democrat who formerly served as state comptroller. In general, third terms are not a good idea, and Mr. Rowland's administration has begun to suffer from the kind of cronyism and questionable practices that typify a governor who has been in power too long. Connecticut's race, with a two-term governor versus a former state comptroller, is strangely similar to New York's. The big difference is that Connecticut voters are not being forced to choose between an unsatisfactory incumbent and an even less promising opponent. Bill Curry is a good candidate with fresh ideas and strong credentials as a political reformer. 
 Mr. Curry, who ran a close second in a four-way race that elevated Mr. Rowland to the governorship eight years ago, won our endorsement at the time for his record as comptroller and his ideas about how to deal with sprawl, transportation and the economy. Those qualities are needed even more now that Connecticut faces a growing budget deficit and tougher times, especially in urban areas. This year, Mr. Curry has focused on helping the state's middle class, promising to make cities more livable and taxes more equitable. 
 One of the most serious arguments against Governor Rowland is his refusal to provide any real explanation for the loss of almost $200 million in state funds in what amounted to an unsecured loan to Enron from the state's trash authority. Shortly after the loan, Enron made an $80,000 contribution, since returned, to the Republican Governors Association, which Mr. Rowland now heads. Mr. Rowland fired two top aides whose names have surfaced as part of the investigation, but he has denied any connection or any advance knowledge of the loan. It is hard to imagine that he heard nothing about this deal. But not knowing how his co-chief of staff was handing out so much state money is also no way to run a state government. We endorse Bill Curry for governor of Connecticut.

Finding More Room For Carry-On Bags
The most experienced business travelers often pride themselves on not checking bags on airplanes, stashing their stuff in overhead bins instead. 
 With a potentially massive checked-baggage traffic jam looming on Jan. 1, when federal law will require all stowed bags to be screened by new explosive-detection machines, the coveted and sometimes fought-over overhead bin space on airlines is likely to become a bigger issue as more passengers avoid checking bags. 
 Its new aircraft orders sagging, Boeing evidently is looking at new opportunities in retrofitting existing planes, and finding some in the bag-stowage area. A new Boeing product called BigBins allows single-aisle 757 and 737 Boeing aircraft to claim 60 percent more storage capacity, Boeing said. On a 737-700, the new bins accommodate 31 additional roll-aboard bags, and 58 more on a 757-300, the company added.
The first 737 with the bigger storage space was delivered last week to the Canadian carrier WestJet Airlines. Northwest Airlines also said it was planning to install the new bins on some of its planes.

Where to Meet And Save Money
What are the most affordable meeting and conference cities in the country? A survey by the travel company GetThere.com used there parameters: 100 attendees (2 from each of the 50 states) at a three-day event in the fall, flying on 21-day advance air fares and paying standard hotel group rates. 
The cheapest in the top 25 was Jacksonville, Fla., at $139,000. Orlando, Fla., was No. 13, at $180,000. Las Vegas was No. 16 at $186,000. New York was No. 23 at $197,000. Tied for most expensive were San Diego and Los Angeles, $217,000 each.

Delta to Make Upgrades Easier
Delta Air Lines is making it easier to buy your way into the front of the plane. Starting Nov. 11, standby upgrade purchasing options will be offered domestically on select off-peak flights. 
The cost of upgrades will range from $50 to $150 depending on the route. Most published fares are eligible, but customers flying on deeply discounted and sale fares will not be able to participate. Delta hastened to note that the expanded standby upgrades would not affect the allotment of seats available to its SkyMiles members who are availing themselves of any of the regular, confirmed upgrade offers.

Virgin Atlantic Sets New African Route
Virgin Atlantic Airways said yesterday that it would become the first airline to operate nonstop services between London and Port Harcourt, Nigeria, twice weekly, starting in January. Port Harcourt is "the oil capital of West Africa," noted Richard Branson, the chairman of Virgin Atlantic, which also flies to Lagos six times a week and has said it plans to increase that to daily service next spring.

HEADLINE: Trapped in Japan's Bank Crisis 

BYLINE:  By Akio Mikuni and R. Taggart Murphy; Akio Mikuni and R. Taggart Murphy are the authors of "Japan's Policy Trap: Dollars, Deflation and the Crisis of Japanese Finance."

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
It is an old routine that goes back half a century: a sudden show of resolve in Tokyo to do whatever it takes to fix whatever problem worries the United States -- complete with "reformist" ministers and bold policy pronouncements. In time, both the policy and the minister are forgotten, and Japan returns to business and politics as usual.
 In this case, Heizo Takenaka, Japan's economics minister and chief financial regulator, was set last week to announce a bold plan to restructure Japan's banking system, which has more than $400 billion in bad debt. With the support and approval of the United States, Mr. Takenaka acknowledged that the banks will be unable to recover on their own, and that fixing them will result in the failure of scores of companies. But at home Mr. Takenaka's reform proposals received withering criticism even from members of his own party, and his support from Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi may not last. Moreover, it is not entirely clear that the Bush administration realizes the consequences of Mr. Takenaka's solution. 
 None of this is to say that Mr. Takenaka is not sincere, or that Japan's financial system doesn't face a huge crisis. He is, and it does. But the problem has been widely misunderstood. "Bad loans" only mean something in an environment where a borrower's ability to generate cash flow to service debt is the criterion of whether a loan is good or bad. That was not always true in Japan. Most loans were secured by land and rolled over perpetually. The criterion for loans in Japan was not corporate profitability but bureaucrats' ability to drive up real estate prices.
Japanese finance has, to Western eyes, been an "Alice in Wonderland" affair now for 50 years. Banks once lent far more money than they had in deposits. Then, in the 1980's, Japanese government officials directed banks to lend well in excess of real economic requirements. Much of that lending fueled a surge in land prices that saw the theoretical value of Tokyo's Imperial Palace grounds exceed that of the whole of California.
Bizarre as it may appear to outsiders, Japanese banking nonetheless was driven by two rational objectives: the goal was to finance an industrial plant that would secure Japan's economic autonomy and ensure its political stability. It worked. Four decades after war had left Japan in ruins, the country boasted the world's most formidable industrial machine. And a constant flow of subsidies to politically powerful groups -- farmers, small shopkeepers, half a million construction companies -- has bought 50 years of political peace.
In recent decades, however, the system has changed. Credit now goes increasingly to protect politically well-connected companies from failing rather than to the kinds of firms that built the fabled Japanese economic miracle. These credit policies, combined with falling land prices, brought economic growth in Japan to a halt a decade ago.
One of the results of this collapse is more than $400 billion in unrecoverable loans. But recovering those loans is not simply a matter of closing certain banks, recapitalizing others and allowing some big companies to fail.
For starters, any questioning of the banks' integrity could lead to economic disaster domestically. If the banks are seen as corrupt, individual depositors could pull their money out of them. Japan's household savings overwhelmingly take the form of bank deposits that carry either explicit or implied government guarantees. The Japanese government, already heavily in debt itself, can ill afford to honor these guarantees during a wave of failures brought on by a run on the banks.
Closing the banks could also cause a political crisis. The flow of cash -- from household to bank to well-connected borrower employing retired bureaucrats and voters for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party -- fuels the very engine of the Japanese political economy. Turning off this flow is tantamount to revolution.
The notion that Mr. Takenaka is going to do that, even with the full support of Prime Minister Koizumi and the off-stage applause of the United States Treasury Department, is preposterous. Indeed, last week members of his own party and even a fellow cabinet minister criticized Mr. Takenaka openly.
Any Japanese reform, political or economic, must eventually face this reality: Japan has no central government able to override the quasi-sovereign fiefdoms that constitute the Japanese political order. Those fiefdoms -- the more powerful ministries together with their proteges and the various factions of the L.D.P. that provide political protection for them -- can and will sabotage any policy initiative that threatens their autonomy.
This lack of any institutional mechanism for overriding the claims of special interests helps explain the policy trap in which Japan now finds itself. During the decades when the economy grew rapidly, this institutional failing did not matter so much. But just as the Japanese military leadership in World War II never allowed for the possibility of retreat and didn't know how to conduct one, Japan's current economic leadership has no accepted means of distributing the pain that would inevitably accompany Mr. Takenaka's reforms. That is why, like all other such initiatives of the past decade, they will be allowed to proceed only when they have been gutted.
An upheaval in Japanese finance, bringing with it a complete restructuring, is not impossible. But such a restructuring would produce shocks that would reverberate around the world.
Japan as a nation holds nearly $3 trillion in dollar-denominated assets, many of them ultimately supported by the very deposits that would be withdrawn in a wholesale reorganization of Japanese banking. Those dollars have played an indispensable role in permitting the United States to swell its trade deficits far beyond the levels of most nations.
That so many foreigners are willing to keep their earnings from trade inside the United States banking system -- what "holding dollars" literally means -- helps the United States tolerate its deficits. But this situation is precisely what restructuring in Japan threatens. If banks were forced to call in loans to pay off depositors, and if those loans financed their customers' dollar holdings, Japanese companies would be forced to sell their dollars for yen. Real money and purchasing power would then leave the United States as the conversion weakened the dollar, forcing a rise in interest rates and import prices and further raising the risk of recession.
That is what usually happens to countries that run excessive trade deficits -- foreigners lose confidence in these countries' currencies, interest rates rise, the economy goes into recession and, as people can't afford to buy so many imports, the trade deficit begins to close. The United States has escaped this fate largely because of the very problems with Japanese finance that Mr. Takenaka promises to attack. Washington ought to be careful what it wishes for.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Investors' Doubt Over Coming Data Puts End to Rally

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks slumped yesterday, pulling back from a three-week rally, as investors worried that this week's economic data could signal that growth in the United States remains weak.
 The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has climbed about 14 percent the last three weeks through Friday as surprisingly strong quarterly earnings pulled the index off five-year lows. But analysts warned that profit results were largely built into share prices and said today's consumer confidence data would probably show that people were less confident about the economy. 
 "The news about earnings was better than anticipated, but we've received most of the benefit from that. People are focusing on economic numbers due out this week," said Eric Barden, a fund manager for Texas Capital Value Funds. "They're afraid of what those numbers could do to the market." 
Data scheduled for this week include gross domestic product for the third quarter, October unemployment, and the Conference Board's consumer confidence reading.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 75.95 points, or 0.9 percent, to 8,368.04. The S.& P. 500 slipped 7.42 points, or 0.8 percent, to 890.23. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index dropped 15.26 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,315.87.
All three market gauges finished their third consecutive winning week on Friday, giving them the longest weekly stretch of gains since August. But traders said investors were locking in profits on worries about this week's economic data.
In addition, the market's mood was colored by a report saying the Federal Reserve was worried the economy could be vulnerable to a shock like a war in Iraq and may cut interest rates the next few months.
The market is wrapping up its third-quarter earnings season. As of yesterday, 73 percent of the companies in the S.& P. 500 had reported results, and 59 percent of those had topped Wall Street's expectations, the market research firm Thomson First Call said.
In corporate news, a downgrade of the Web equipment maker Cisco Systems weighed on technology stocks and sent shares of Cisco falling 7.5 percent, or 88 cents, to $10.90. Morgan Stanley cut Cisco's rating, saying the price is too high, given the company's growth outlook.
Brocade Communications Systems, a maker of storage network equipment, dropped $1.42, or 17 percent, to $6.83, after the company said its quarterly results would be 30 percent below expectations because of continued weakness in information technology spending.
On a brighter note, Citigroup rose 60 cents, to $36.30, after the investment bank Lehman Brothers raised its investment rating.
Hewlett-Packard added 65 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $15.27, after Lehman said that the fourth quarter looked solid with printing showing higher-than-expected revenue growth and margins.
The drug makers, Merck and Schering-Plough, jumped on reports that the Food and Drug Administration had approved their new cholesterol drug Zetia. Merck rose $1.32, to $54.23, while Schering-Plough advanced 78 cents, to $21.13.
Prices on Treasury notes were mixed yesterday on speculation that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates before the end of the year.
The two-year note rose 5/32, to 100 14/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 1.90 percent from 1.98 percent on Friday.
The 10-year note was unchanged at 102 9/32. The yield was also unchanged at 4.09 percent.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond decreased 11/32, to 104 1/32. The yield rose to 5.10 percent from 5.09 percent.

HEADLINE: Protesters Seek Local Hearing On Flight 587 Crash in Queens 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
As federal investigators prepared to open hearings on Tuesday on the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 near Kennedy International Airport last November, a busload of protesters from New York called for a boycott of the proceedings because they will not be held near the crash site.
 The plane, an Airbus A-300 headed for the Dominican Republic, broke up over the Belle Harbor section of Queens shortly after takeoff from Kennedy last Nov. 12. All 260 people on board died, along with five others on the ground. Most of the victims were from the Dominican Republic. 
 About 25 protesters gathered here today on a plaza in front of the National Transportation Safety Board offices, carrying signs reading, "Hearings in Washington Heights, not D.C." Washington Heights, in upper Manhattan, has a large Dominican population.
"We fly the American Airlines Airbus every day," said Fernando Mateo, an organizer of the protest. "We have a right to know what happened to that airplane." Most of the protesters had no relatives on the plane, but several who did said that they wanted to be able to question witnesses and present their own.
The board used to hold hearings near crash scenes, but now uses a 12,500-square-foot conference center in a former movie theater near its offices. The renovated space can seat more than 300 people. In December 2000, the agency used the conference center for the hearings involving the crash of an Alaska Airlines flight off the Los Angeles coast. The conference center saves the cost of sending dozens of people to distant cities, housing them there for a week or so and hauling thousands of pounds of documents and equipment, board officials say.
The board, an independent federal agency, plans to call American Airlines personnel in charge of training; structural engineers from Airbus; experts on carbon fiber materials used in the plane's construction; Federal Aviation Administration officials who were involved in accepting French certification of the plane; aerospace engineering specialists from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and others.
They will be questioned by board staff members, as well as representatives of the F.A.A., Airbus, American and the pilots' union.
Beginning with the 1996 crashes of ValuJet Flight 592 and T.W.A. Flight 800, the board has set aside seating for families and tried to accommodate relatives in other ways, but has resisted bringing them, or their lawyers, into the technical discussions.
In the case of Flight 587, which was headed to Santo Domingo, also clamoring to be heard are a group of pilots who fly the A-300, and a mixed group of eyewitnesses and nonaviators who argue that the plane was brought down by a terrorist bomb.
Hector Hipolito Algarroba, whose mother and father were on Flight 587, said that even hearings in New York would not have been sufficient. "Family members in the Dominican Republic may be unable to travel due to documentation or economic reasons," he said. The hearing should have been broadcast there, he said.
Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the safety board, said that the hearing would be carried live on the board's Web site, www.ntsb.gov, and that a translator for the State Department would be present at a nearby conference room, where family members could watch the hearing on a television screen.

HEADLINE: For the People 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Ghoulish but true: as Minnesota mourns the death of Senator Paul Wellstone, many of the state's residents have been receiving fliers bearing a picture of a tombstone. The fliers, sent out by a conservative business group, denounce the late senator's support for maintaining the estate tax. Under the tombstone, the text reads in part: "Paul Wellstone not only wants to tax you and your business to death . . . he wants to tax you in the hereafter." 
 To be fair, the people who mailed out those fliers -- which are carefully worded so that the cost of the mailing doesn't officially count as a campaign contribution -- didn't know how tasteless they would now appear. Yet in a sense the mass mailing is a fitting epitaph; it reminds us what Paul Wellstone stood for, and how brave he was to take that stand. 
 Sometimes it seems as if Americans have forgotten what courage means. Here's a hint: talking tough doesn't make you a hero; you have to take personal risks. And I'm not just talking about physical risks -- though it's striking how few of our biggest flag wavers have ever put themselves in harm's way. What we should demand of our representatives in Washington is the willingness to take political risks -- to make a stand on principle, even if it means taking on powerful interest groups. 
Paul Wellstone took risks. He was, everyone acknowledges, a politician who truly voted his convictions, who supported what he thought was right, not what he thought would help him get re-elected. He took risky stands on many issues: agree or disagree, you have to admit that his vote against authorization for an Iraq war was a singularly brave act. Yet the most consistent theme in his record was economic -- his courageous support for the interests of ordinary Americans against the growing power of our emerging plutocracy.
In our money-dominated politics, that's a dangerous position to take. When Mr. Wellstone first ran for the Senate, his opponent outspent him seven to one. According to one of his advisers, the success of that ramshackle campaign, run from a rickety green school bus, "made politics safe for populists again." 
If only. Almost every politician in modern America pretends to be a populist; indeed, it's a general rule that the more slavishly a politician supports the interests of wealthy individuals and big corporations, the folksier his manner. But being a genuine populist, someone who really tries to stand up against what Mr. Wellstone called "Robin Hood in reverse" policies, isn't easy: you must face the power not just of money, but of sustained and shameless hypocrisy.
And that's why those fliers are a perfect illustration of what Paul Wellstone was fighting.
On one side, the inclusion of estate tax repeal in last year's federal tax cut is the most striking example to date of how our political system serves the interests of the wealthy. After all, the estate tax affects only a small minority of families; the bulk of the tax is paid by a tiny elite. In fact, estate tax repeal favors the wealthy to such an extent that defenders of last year's tax cut -- like Senator Charles Grassley, who published a misleading letter in last Friday's Times -- always carefully omit it from calculations of who benefits. (The letter talked only about the income tax; had he included the effects of estate tax repeal, he would have been forced to admit that more than 40 percent of the benefits of that tax cut go to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population.) To eliminate the estate tax in the face of budget deficits means making the rich richer even as we slash essential services for the middle class and the poor.
On the other side, the estate tax debate illustrates the pervasive hypocrisy of our politics. For repeal of the "death tax" has been cast, incredibly, as a populist issue. Thanks to sustained, lavishly financed propaganda -- of which that anti-Wellstone flier was a classic example -- millions of Americans imagine, wrongly, that the estate tax mainly affects small businesses and farms, and that its repeal will help ordinary people. And who pays for the propaganda? Guess. It's amazing what money can buy.
In an age of fake populists, Paul Wellstone was the real thing. Now he's gone. Will others have the courage to carry on?

HEADLINE: U.S. Crime Rate Rose 2% in 2001 After 10 Years of Decreases 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
For the first time since 1991, serious and violent crime in the United States increased last year, the F.B.I. reported yesterday.
 The bureau's annual Uniform Crime Report found that murder, the crime that is best measured because it is least likely to go unreported, rose 2.5 percent nationwide over the figure for 2000. At the same time, robberies climbed 3.7 percent, burglaries 2.9 percent, petty thefts 1.5 percent and motor vehicle thefts 5.7 percent. 
 Rape also increased by 0.3 percent, the report said, while aggravated assault dropped 0.5 percent. Figures for these two crimes are considered the least reliable of the seven that go into the F.B.I.'s index because of problems with reporting and measuring them. 
Over all, crime rose 2.1 percent across the nation, the report said. Experts and law enforcement officials said the overall increase, after a decade of drops in the crime rate, appeared to reflect several factors: a faltering economy, cuts in welfare and anticrime programs, as well as fewer jobs available, more inmates returning home from prison, an increase in the teenage population, and police resources diverted to antiterrorism efforts. 
In addition, the experts said, after 10 years of decreases, in which the crime rate dropped to its lowest level since the late 1960's, it would have been hard for it to keep falling.
"We all knew that the marked downward trend of crime in the 90's could not continue indefinitely," said Alfred Blumstein, a professor of statistics and criminology at Carnegie Mellon University. "The crime rate really came down very far, and one would have hoped it was an indication of improvements in society, but that didn't happen. The economy is a big part of the story."
James Alan Fox, a professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University, said: "The great crime drop of the 1990's is over. It was wishful thinking that it would continue forever. Crime is very resilient." 
Regionally, there were sharp differences in overall crime last year. The rate rose 3 percent in the West, 1.1 percent in the Midwest and 0.3 percent in the South. In the Northeast, crime decreased 1.9 percent. And four Eastern cities showed a drop in murders in 2001. 
New York had the biggest decline, with 649 murders in 2001 compared with 673 in 2000, a decrease of 3.6 percent. Philadelphia had a decrease of 3.1 percent, Washington 2.9 percent and Baltimore 1.9 percent.
By contrast, in Las Vegas murders rose 48 percent in 2001, to 133 from 90 in 2000, while in Phoenix the number jumped 37.5 percent, to 209 from 152 in 2000. San Antonio recorded a 17.6 rise in murders last year, to 100 from 85 in 2000, and St. Louis rose 19.4 percent, to 148 from 124 in 2000.
In Phoenix, Detective Tony Morales, a police spokesman, said much of the increase was caused by increased smuggling of drugs and illegal aliens on the border with Mexico. Criminals have learned how to circumvent efforts by federal law enforcement to crack down on illegal activity at the border, he said, "so our crime rate is going back up."
"Narcotics is the No. 1 motive in our homicides," Detective Morales said. "We have instituted new programs to combat narcotics, but the numbers have started to creep back up anyway.
"Another thing that has tripled in the past few years is home invasion robberies, mostly Hispanics on Hispanics, and people are reluctant to call the police," Detective Morales continued. "So the real numbers are probably much higher."
The F.B.I. report measures arrests reported by 17,000 local police agencies around the nation to the bureau.
One striking increase was the 3.7 percent jump in robberies, the first increase since 1991. Among the reasons was a sudden increase in bank robberies in many parts of the country. 
Over all, robberies caused losses estimated at $532 billion in 2001, the report found. Bank robberies had the highest average loss, at $4,587 per offense.
The homicide figures did not include the 3,047 deaths as a result of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. The F.B.I. published them in a separate section. If they had been included in the regular total of murders, they would have had a substantial impact on the homicide rate, since there were a total of 15,980 other murders last year.
Criminologists have long tried to tease out the factors that caused the crime drop of the 1990's, but cannot do so with great accuracy. In the same way, it is next to impossible to quantify accurately the different variables causing crime to start back up again. 
One factor that can be measured, Professor Fox said, is that the number of teenagers is now increasing 1 percent a year, after a decline in the 1990's. People in their late teens and early 20's are in the prime years for committing crime, statistics show.

HEADLINE: They're Alive! They're Alive! Not!; 
Japan Hesitates to Put an End to Its 'Zombie' Businesses

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
For a corporate deadbeat, the retailer Daiei was positively hopping downstairs on a recent evening with customers lured in by peppy tunes blaring from loudspeakers and clerks offering free sushi morsels. But upstairs at the three-floor store in the Nishi Kasai district, a forest of commuter high rises in eastern Tokyo, ghostly empty aisles in home appliances and women's clothing made it clear why Daiei had become perhaps the leading Japanese "zombie," a prime example of the thousands of dead businesses acting as if they are still alive.
 Daiei (pronounced die-ay) has been on artificial support for several years: despite sales that have fallen 25 percent since 1999, it has managed to borrow trillions more yen from its banks. In its most recent fiscal year, which ended in March, it lost $3.7 billion on sales of $14 billion. In the United States, this retail chain would probably have gone the way of Woolworth's and Montgomery Ward by now. 
 But here in the land of economic harmony, Daiei's major banks have been encouraged by politicians and government officials to keep it going at all cost. Even before last year's huge loss was disclosed, Daiei's creditors generously approved a leisurely three-year reorganization plan that involved extending $3.4 billion in fresh credits and debt forgiveness. And earlier this month, when Daiei was on the verge of announcing that its sales had fallen another 7 percent, the government-owned Japan Development Bank softened the blow by leading a new bailout of $480 million.
The latest move alarmed many experts who had hoped that this month's elevation of Heizo Takenaka to economy czar suggested that Japan would finally start tackling its bad loan problems in an aggressive way, pulling the plug on some of the biggest zombies to allow money, people and assets to flow instead to more productive uses.
But the horror movie is far from over. Mr. Takenaka, the technocrat, immediately butted heads with Takeo Hiranuma, a politician who as Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry announced earlier this year that Daiei, which employs 96,000 people, was simply too big to be allowed to fail.
"The government is not going to be hard on the banks," said Brian J. Waterhouse, senior Japan analyst for HSBC. "The zombies are not going to get beaten up."
The worthless debts of the banks are so large that there is an understandable fear that any serious effort to shut off the lending spigot risks turning Japan's latest recession into something much worse. Officially, Japan's bad loans add up to $348 billion. Unofficial estimates run two to three times higher: Teikoku Databank, a Japanese credit research agency, estimates 200,000 financially troubled companies in Japan owe about $1 trillion, or one quarter of the gross national product.
But doing nothing means that Japan's financial wounds will simply continue to fester, blocking hopes for the central bank to ease monetary policy and preventing the nation from recovering its economic health.
Japan "is a losers paradise, a country where inefficiencies are rewarded," Jesper Koll, chief economist for Merrill Lynch Japan, wrote recently. "These zombie companies neither have good balance sheets nor operating performance. All they have is solid, old-style feudal lords who can get access to more revolving credit due to their political connections and their club memberships."
With its orange sun logo, Daiei became a household name in the 1960's as Japan's first real chain of supermarkets. Its brash founder, Isao Nakauchi, ridiculed government regulations protecting small neighborhood shops as the welfare system of Japan.
Adding home appliances and other products to its mix, Daiei prospered for years by defying the informal retail price support system imposed by manufacturers to protect local shops. Like many Japanese supermarket chains, Daiei early on added clothing and electronic goods to become an unwieldy all-purpose store.
During the boom years of the late 1980's, however, Daiei took a wrong turn, as did many Japanese companies that had only known success and expansion since their founding. Mr. Nakauchi used over-priced real estate as collateral to buy hotels, restaurants and the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks baseball team, along with that classic Japanese money pit, a baseball stadium called the Fukuoka Dome.
That might not have mattered if Daiei had remained successful in its basic business. But its haphazard diversification interfered with efforts to keep up with new competition from more efficient discounters.
"A lot of these retailers in Japan invested outside of their core competencies," said Lewis I. Cohen, an executive for Toys "R" Us, which has 125 stores here, making Japan its largest market outside the United States. "They lost focus."
Daiei's fall has been fast. In 1995, it was Japan's largest home electronic appliance retailer, selling $2 billion worth of electronic goods that year. This month, Daiei announced that it will drop electronics entirely and is negotiating with a discounter to rent the empty space in its stores.
Meanwhile, managers let its original business deteriorate. "If we are buying things where we don't care about quality, we buy them here," said Hitoshi Kobayashi, a 55-year-old salaryman as he waited outside for his wife to buy some cheap underwear.
Daiei's employees, he complained, increasingly seem to be inexperienced part-timers. "At the fish counter, they seem to be real amateurs," he added. "They can't answer questions."
Inside the store, a young worker in the produce section paused from filling a bag of onions. "I am rather worried," he said. "Today, sales are fairly good. But on some days, there are very few people in the store."
In hopes of engineering a turnaround, Daiei said it would close 60 money losing stores this year, about 20 percent of its total, while refurbishing 57 branches, at $2 million a store.
But its improvements have met with little success. Sales at the renovated outlets are up only 2 percent compared with a year earlier, far below the 10 percent target increase.
In another bid to improve its bottom line, Daiei spent about 1 billion yen ($8 million) to convert a discount outlet in a Tokyo suburb to an upscale cluster of specialty shops. But sales fell far short of the planned increase and even lagged 20 percent behind the old operation in the same space.
"Daiei is a corporate revitalization problem, and that is really a human capital problem," Robert H. Dugger, managing director of the Tudor Investment Corporation, said on a visit here. "In Japan, there are 500 to 600 professional turnaround managers. In the United States, there are 10,000 to 12,000."
And even though Daiei's average interest rate on its loans is only 1.7 percent, Japan's relentless deflation makes its real debt burden heavier over time rather than lighter as it would be in a mildly inflationary environment.
But Daiei's finances are almost irrelevant to its fate. "Daiei is beyond being an economic issue," said Toshiko Binder, an HSBC retail analyst. "It is a political issue."
Analysts say that the Daiei case illustrates the enduring strength of Japan's traditional iron triangle linking politicians, bureaucrats and bankers.
Today, Daiei shares bounce up and down on a yo-yo string of government announcements. On Oct. 7, when newspapers here picked up a comment by Mr. Takenaka that no company was too big to fail, Daiei shares plunged to 87 yen (70 cents) a share. But the following week, when Mr. Hiranuma orchestrated the government bailout, the stock hit 165 yen ($1.33).
Last September, the Mycal Corporation, a general merchandising company, collapsed under the weight of debt that was eerily similar in size to that of Daiei today -- $13.7 billion. Mycal was allowed to fail because it borrowed largely through corporate bonds, a more unforgiving market. In contrast, Daiei borrowed largely from banks, a market where personal lobbying can do wonders.
In Japan, nearly 60 percent of all corporate debt comes from banks. In the United States, it is the reverse.
Some analysts say that if Daiei were allowed to collapse, it could take a mega-bank or two along with it. By agreeing that Daiei is on the mend, the banks avoid taking provisions against the loans.
So it's no surprise that the company continues to enjoy unquestioned support from its banks and political backers. "We're doing better than before," Kunio Takagi, Daiei's new president, said earlier this month when announcing the company's latest results. "Our banks and the government have given our performance the thumbs up."
And that is good enough to reassure many of the company's employees that their jobs are secure.
"I am not worried about Daiei at least for three years," said a fishmonger at the tuna counter. "They have a three-year plan, right?"

HEADLINE: A Sick Banking System Resists Therapy 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
In the heady, asset-inflated bubble of the 1980's, Hamao Yokota used to receive marching orders from his boss, a branch manager at the Bank of Yokohama: Lend money or else.
 Construction companies, real estate speculators, anyone with collateral -- and many without -- were given billions of yen. Mr. Yokota rarely asked his clients what they did with the money, nor was he expected to know. Failure to follow orders or the temerity to raise doubts were grounds for transfer to a subsidiary, where insubordinate workers were forced to wax floors and clean toilets. 
 "It was crazy, like a festival where you run down the streets and don't know where you're going," said Mr. Yokota, who quit the bank in disgust in 1992. "But sooner or later, you wake up with a hangover." 
Japan is still trying to cure that hangover. After a decade of falling asset prices and grinding deflation, the banks are running out of capital as they struggle to write off more than $400 billion in bad loans that their loose lending practices helped create. Their clients, many of the nation's largest companies, are increasingly unable to repay the interest on their loans, and some are going out of business. As a result, there is less money available to help newer, more promising, companies.
Incredibly, these problems have not persuaded Japanese banks to turn off the taps to deadbeat borrowers. Despite already writing off $650 billion in nonperforming loans over the last decade, Japan's largest banks still funnel money into many of the country's most debt-ridden clients, lest they collapse and leave the banks with even larger losses.
These decisions are not driven by rational, linear profit motives, but instead by an unwritten code called shigarami, in which loans are based more on longstanding relationships, political pressure and the mutual need to survive, a culture that Mr. Yokota now details in serialized books. By some estimates, one-third of loans are still doled out this way.
Repairing this mess is the job of Heizo Takenaka, Japan's top financial regulator, who is facing an onslaught of opposition from the political establishment. His advisory council is expected to introduce a set of proposals this week to force banks to more strictly assess their nonperforming loans and to accept public money if they are undercapitalized. But Mr. Takenaka also knows that if he is ever to put Japan on a safer financial footing, he must overhaul the way banks lend.
That is why Mr. Takenaka's panel may also force banks to adopt techniques, common in the United States and Europe, that gauge a company's potential earnings, not just the collateral it holds against default. The reliance on collateral, particularly real estate, was behind the collapse in the early 90's of Japan's economic "bubble," and is also a big reason why the 11-year slide in land prices is pushing some banks to the brink of bankruptcy. In effect, their antiquated lending practices have perpetuated a crisis that could have ended years ago.
By insisting on more transparent, profit-driven lending practices, Mr. Takenaka is trying to tear down traditional relationships between corporate Japan, the banks and the government. If his proposals were fully adopted, banks would be forced to push hundreds of companies out of business and throw thousands of people out of work. To complicate matters further, the most likely candidates for such tough love would be the companies that form the core of the governing party's support: the same contractors, retailers and real estate brokers Mr. Yokota lent to.
The Liberal Democratic Party, which has led Japan for virtually all the postwar years, is not rolling over. In a show of bald political might, stalwart conservatives in the party last week forced Mr. Takenaka to delay the release of his widely awaited banking plan. They also intend to cushion the blow by providing low-interest loans to small businesses and a reconstruction fund to revitalize companies deemed worthy of survival, including Daiei, a retailer that is one of the country's most indebted businesses.
"The biggest donors to the L.D.P. are banks and construction companies, so if the Liberal Democrats save the banks, contractors will be saved, too," said Fumihiko Igarashi, a lawmaker from the opposition Democratic Party of Japan and that party's finance spokesman. "Unless we eradicate this structure, the whole issue will not be solved."
For all the initial pain it may cause, lending that focuses more on risk is the key to the banks' future profitability and the recovery of the Japanese economy. Steps in that direction will also be accompanied by aid from the Japanese central bank, which has pledged to ease monetary policy further if private banks get tough with their borrowers.
Japan is not the only country where bank lending is driven by policy imperatives and cronyism. In China, sour loans, many made on government orders to keep huge former state-owned businesses open and people employed, are said to be worth about half the country's gross domestic product -- twice as much as in Japan. In Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand, the relationship between banks and their lenders is similarly muddy.
But for the sheer value of bad loans, no country tops Japan. And as deflation persists and the economy deteriorates, bad loans are still accumulating faster than the banks can write them off.
While banks in the United States and Europe have changed their ways in response to past losses at home and abroad, those in Japan operate as if it were still the 1980's. The lack of a strong corporate bond market, coupled with strict requirements for selling stock, means that companies here still go to banks for the bulk of their financial needs. What is more, a paternalistic corporate culture makes it essential for companies to have a main bank that acts as a financial patron and opens doors in Japan's tight-knit business community.
Installing new lending systems will take years, analysts say, even if the Liberal Democratic power brokers relent and agree to enforce stiffer lending standards. Perhaps the most difficult challenge will be changing the way bankers behave. For years, they have pooled savers' money and directed it to companies as if they were semigovernmental institutions, secure in an unspoken guarantee that the Japanese finance ministry would bail them out if trouble arose. For older bankers nearing retirement, putting a wholly different lending system in place is a leap of faith few want to take.
Rieko McCarthy, a credit analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities, said bankers need the pressure of market discipline to adopt a more profit-oriented model. Yet with short-term interest rates effectively at zero and the central bank promising easy credit to those in trouble, bankers are under even less pressure to overhaul their businesses. Though banks are slowly trying to force companies to pay more for loans, a record 20 percent of loans carry interest of less than 1 percent, according to the central bank.
Some institutions have started using quantitative methods like risk-adjusted return on capital to determine the ability of a business borrower to generate enough cash to repay its debts. But this requires people, time and technology of a sort only the largest banks can afford.
In the United States, every major bank and 80 percent of medium-size ones are equipped with up-to-date systems for rating borrowers. In Japan, only a fraction are, and few apply them systematically, according to Pascal Nguyen, a financial consultant in Tokyo who surveyed 25 bank-rating systems.
More worrying, Mr. Nguyen added, many bankers still do not understand the full extent of the troubles they face. Banks that are the most pessimistic about the future of the financial system are also those that pay the most attention to credit risk, he said.
The Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group, experts say, is one of the few banks in this country approaching parity with its global competitors. Alone among Japanese banks, it adopted the probabilities-of-default technique used in the United States and is one of the few Japanese financial institutions to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The benefits are obvious: The bank has the strongest balance sheet among its rivals and is the only big lender to repay funds borrowed from the government in 1998 and 1999.
"For every loan we make, regardless of the credit risk, it has to go through this U.S.-style machinery," said Shinji Munekuni, a spokesman for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
While other lenders would like to follow the bank's lead, they are weighed down by their past practices. The share of loans to affiliated companies, though declining, remains large. Their capital depleted, banks are under pressure to sell shares in these companies, dissolving the cross-shareholdings that linked business to banks for years. But as these ties dissolve, banks must compete more fiercely for customers.
"Companies say that if a bank denies them loans, they may change their main bank," said Hironari Nozaki, an analyst at HSBC Securities who worked at Asahi Bank for 16 years. "If the company has more bargaining power, bank managers might lose face so they continue to provide loans to risky borrowers."
One such borrower is Haseko, a condominium builder that lost 123 billion yen ($995 million) last year as it struggled to write down its debts. With the economy in a rut, Haseko's operating profits fell 18 percent and its shares have traded as low as 13 yen (10 cents) in recent years. Yet in February, its lead banks, Daiwa, Chuo Mitsui Trust and the Industrial Bank of Japan, agreed to forgive 150 billion yen of the company's debts -- its second bailout in three years.
"In 1999, we re-evaluated our company," said Teruo Kojima, a Haseko official, "and we feared that if things remained as they were, our company wouldn't get any better or wouldn't be able to survive. The financial department naturally felt we had to do something about this."
Despite its woes, Haseko is better off than many other companies. It has shed 40 percent of its assets and its stock now trades above 60 yen.
If Mr. Takenaka, the top financial regulator, gets his way, the endangered list may in time shrink as banks are forced to stop financing weakened borrowers. The key, though, is whether the banks get tough with new borrowers or continue creating more problem loans with their loose lending practices.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
With Allies Likely and Unlikely, U.S. Navy Stems Flow of Iraqi Oil

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: ABOARD THE U.S.S. SHILOH, in the northern Persian Gulf, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
The United States and its allies, with quiet help from Iran, have all but shut off the flow of illegal Iraqi oil in the Persian Gulf, playing a game of cat and mouse with small boats that had proven effective tools for smugglers and terrorists alike.
 As the Bush administration prepares for a potential confrontation with Saddam Hussein, America and its naval partners have ratcheted up the pressure. 
 They are boarding twice as many boats as last year, and have stationed an Australian warship inside Iraq's territorial waters, all in an effort to tighten enforcement of United Nations sanctions. 
"What was a blockade that was probably only 30 to 40 percent effective previously is now in the 80 to 90 percent range of effectiveness," said Commodore Peter Sinclair, the Australian officer who commands the allied flotilla that is charged with enforcing the embargo in the gulf.
In September, 318 ships were boarded, about double the number boarded during a similar period last year. Of those, 64 were turned back or detained. 
For now, the allied embargo is also being helped by the Iranians, who once turned a blind eye to smugglers who at night often use routes that hug Iran's coastline. 
It is unclear whether the Iranians, who fought a devastating war with Iraq that ended in 1990, are committed to enforcing the United Nations embargo or simply want to deprive the Americans of a reason to venture into Iran's territorial waters. But the result has been that more boats carrying suspected smugglers are being channeled toward allied patrols.
President Bush has described Iran as part of an "axis of evil," but the relationship between the allied and Iranian navies has been entirely professional, allied commanders say. When the Shiloh, an American Aegis cruiser, passed by an Iranian vessel this week, sailors from the two ships stood at attention and, in a naval ritual known as an exchange of honors, saluted each other. 
The sweltering waters of the Persian Gulf constitute one of the most strategically important regions in the world. The gulf is a major transit point for much of the world's oil, a former battleground between Iran and Iraq and an area where the United States has long sought to project its military power. 
These days it is also filled with a new potential peril: attacks by terrorists in small motor launches or wooden boats. It is the kind of threat to which even the Shiloh -- a billion-dollar marvel that can shoot down antiship cruise missiles -- is vulnerable, even with all its sophisticated technology. Its main defense against terrorist attacks at sea are sentries who peer at the azure waters with binoculars and machine guns and small arms. 
"As the Cole showed us, ships can be vulnerable to that kind of suicide attack," Capt. William E. Dewes, the commander of the Shiloh, said, referring to the American destroyer attacked by terrorists in Yemen in October 2000. "We have improvised and got ourselves a pretty good system. We are using a lot of small arms that other services have." 
The threat of terrorist attacks from small craft is an added twist in the competition between an Iraqi government determined to circumvent United Nations sanctions and an American-led coalition determined to keep pressure on President Hussein. 
Under a program overseen by the United Nations, Iraq is allowed to sell a limited amount of oil and use the proceeds to buy food and medicine. But Iraq has also sought to smuggle additional amounts of oil and other commodities, like dates, by sea and land. 
To the consternation of Washington, which fears that oil revenue can be used by Iraq to develop nuclear, chemical or biological arms, Iraq continues to send oil illegally by pipeline to Syria and by truck to Turkey. 
But the combination of Australian bravado, advanced United States military technology and indirect Iranian cooperation has enabled Washington virtually to close the tap on oil smuggled through the gulf. 
It is clear that the embargo has irritated the Iraqis. The gulf waters are streaked by oil slicks from small boats that were bottled up near Iraq and dumped their cargo out of frustration. In July, the Baghdad complained to the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, accusing the Australian and American Navies of piracy for systematically boarding every ship going to and from Iraq. 
The sailors have taken the accusation in stride. Some Australian sailors even have a nickname for themselves, referring to their exploits in the North Arabian Gulf. They call themselves the "Pirates of the NAG." 
The contest between these "pirates" and the smugglers starts at the Iraqi town of Umm Qasr, where Iraqi oil and other cargo is loaded on ships that make their way down the Khawr Abd Allah, the main Iraqi waterway that leads to the northern Persian Gulf.
The smugglers have used a variety of tactics to sneak cargo holds of Iraqi oil and other commodities past the allied flotilla, Australian and American officers said. 
When using larger vessels, the smugglers attached spikes to the hulls to puncture the small, inflatable boats that American and allied navies use to approach them. They hid oil and other cargo under piles of hay or newly laid cement floors. They welded hatches shut to prevent inspection. 
After allied ships cracked down on smuggling by large, steel-hull ships, the Iraqis tried a new tactic. They flooded the gulf with dhows, wooden boats that are used by local traders and fishermen but can also hold several hundred metric tons of oil each. 
But the United States and its allies have largely cut off the small boats, too. The tighter embargo has been so effective that it has even halted much of Iraq's export of dates, a valued gulf commodity that pound for pound fetches a higher price than oil. 
The allied embargo is overseen by Vice Adm. Timothy Keating, who commands the Navy's Fifth Fleet. He in turn has given the Australians command of the multinational flotilla of American, British and Australian ships that is directly charged with policing the sanctions.
After the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the United States and its allies sent more ships, planes and other military forces toward the Arabian Sea, where some of them have been used to stanch the flow of illegal Iraqi oil.
"Sept. 11 led the coalition and the U.S. to put more effort into the war on terror, and that means that more ships, special forces, aircraft, military assets of all types have become available," Commodore Sinclair said.
The allies also began to use Kuwaiti ships to siphon off the oil from smugglers detained at sea. That dispensed with the need for allied ships to escort the detained ships to gulf ports, allowing them to patrol longer. 
Finally, the Iranians lent indirect help, through coastal units of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as well as naval vessels.
"There has been an increase in professionalism by the Iranian Navy," Commodore Sinclair said. "On several occasions they have assisted by pushing smugglers out into international waters." 
With its classified displays and rows of computers, the Shiloh's command center has been a hub of the embargo effort. Teams of American and Australian officers monitor the boardings in Iraq's coastal waters.
The center takes data from airborne reconnaissance planes and its own advanced radar to create a picture of air and naval traffic through the Persian Gulf and beyond. 
It can also send one of its two SH-60 Sea Hawk helicopters to the boarding sites to beam back pictures of the operation, using special sensors that create images from the heat of ships and other objects. 
A recent night operation illustrated how this American, Australian and British task force works.
Several Iraqi dhows emerged from the Khawr Abd Allah only to confront the Melbourne, an Australian frigate whose shallow draft allows it to maneuver just six miles off Iraq's coast, well within Iraq's 12-mile-wide territorial waters.
"We are operating continually inside Iraq's territorial waters," Commodore Sinclair said. "The smugglers know there is a big gray warship blocking the river before they even set sail."
As the Iraqi vessels approached, small inflatable boats were rapidly lowered into the water from the Melbourne and teams of Australian sailors, guns at the ready, piled in. The boats raced to the side of the suspected smugglers so that the Australians could climb on board.
As the Australians inspected the vessels, Lt. Cmdr. William Chase and Lt. Gabriel Kelly flew the United States Sea Hawk helicopter that hovered overhead. The pictures transmitted to the command staff on the Shiloh enabled it to monitor the operation as it unfolded. The helicopter also provided cover for the boardings with a .50-caliber machine gun.
On this run, the allied teams found that the dhows indeed contained illegal oil and dates, and the boats were forced to turn back. 
But that is just the first zone of the allies' defense. To the south is an area that allied sailors call the "car park." Situated about 12 miles from the Iraqi coast, it is a place where vessels wait for Iraqi harbor masters to guide them into the Khawr Abd Allah, a waterway allied sailors refer to simply as the "K.A.A." American and Australian sailors inspect the car park daily, taking down the names and positions of the ships to create a data base of shipping in and out of Iraq.
Still farther south is a region the Americans have named Comiskey after the Chicago baseball park. Here, sailors also board gulf vessels going to and from Iraq, including some of the larger ships that the Melbourne assumes are probably carrying legitimate cargo and are allowed to pass. 
Some of the inspections can take hours, as sailors rappel down the sides of huge containers and peer into metal tanks. The goal is not just to stop illicit exports but also to ensure that no military supplies or illegal cargo are brought in.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ATTACK ON U.S. DIPLOMAT; 
AMERICAN ENVOY KILLED IN JORDAN

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
A senior American diplomat in Jordan, Laurence Foley, was gunned down outside his house today, shot eight times at close range in what appeared to be the latest of a string of terror attacks against Western targets in the region and beyond. 
 The assassination reverberated through this often sleepy capital, not least among the expatriate community. Foreign residents said they had been rudely awakened to the realization that the potential for escalating violence on both sides of Jordan -- in the West Bank as well as in Iraq -- could roil a city long considered safe. 
 Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, American embassies around the world have frequently closed their doors in response to threats or warnings of possible attacks. But to a large extent, American missions abroad rely on the vigilance of their employees, repeatedly cautioning them to be alert to their surroundings. 
"Since that day, Sept. 11, we have been under severe security alerts and concerns repeatedly," said the United States ambassador here, Edward W. Gnehm.
The United States Embassy in Amman was closed after the attack today and a warning notice was issued to employees and to Americans living in Jordan. "The one today reminded people that it was very important that they look after their personal security in a very vigilant way," Mr. Gnehm said.
He refused to comment on who might be behind the assassination, saying it was too early to speculate about any group or motive. 
Both Jordanian and American officials said it was too soon to determine whether there might be any link to Al Qaeda or other militant Islamic groups.
In Washington, the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said, "At this point, we have to know a little more before we start to describe it as terrorist." He also said that it seemed to fit the pattern of other deadly attacks at so-called "soft" targets this year, including a church in Pakistan and a nightclub in Indonesia.
"All over the world, we've seen this terrible practice that when we are better able to protect what you might call the hard targets," he said, "they tend to go looking for other things." 
Analysts were quick to point out that numerous small militant groups unearthed by security forces in Jordan in recent years, including operatives linked to Al Qaeda, harbored virulently anti-American and anti-Western sentiments. 
About half of Jordan's residents are Palestinians, and many Iraqis live there as well. The widespread perception in the Arab world that the United States has been biased on the side of Israel, and the opposition in the region to the prospect of an American military attack on Iraq have compounded the tension. 
Rebecca Salti, an American who has lived in Amman for three decades, spoke of a widespread sense in the region that Washington remained in a heedless confrontation with Arabs and Muslims, and said this was creating "a political earthquake."
"There are victims who have to pay the price," she said. "Who is going to be next?"
Jordanian investigators said that Mr. Foley was shot with a 7-millimeter pistol around 7:15 a.m., and collapsed in his driveway next to his maroon Mercedes with its diplomatic license plates. His wife, Virginia, discovered his body in a pool of blood and alerted the police.
The American Embassy said that Mr. Foley, who was from Oakland, Calif., had been working in Jordan since August 2000 as a senior administrator of America's development assistance program here. He had recently celebrated his 60th birthday and just on Sunday received an award for his aid work.
Ambassador Gnehm, his voice breaking as he noted Mr. Foley's long years of service to the United States, said his government was outraged by what he described as a "heinous act." 
Neighbors getting their children ready for school this morning said they heard neither gunshots nor the usual barking that the Foleys' golden retriever directed at passing strangers. "It's something weird, we didn't hear anything," said Osama Rafidi, a jewelry store owner who lives across the street. "We didn't hear gunshots, we didn't hear cars, we didn't hear anyone running, nothing."
Mr. Foley's neighbors noted that there were occasionally embassy guards outside the house, a two-story white limestone building with magenta bougainvillea spilling over the walls. But they said no guards were in evidence this morning.
There are about 9,000 American citizens in Jordan -- most of them dual nationals -- registered with the embassy, said a spokesman, Justin H. Siberell. Although an Israeli businessman was killed in Mr. Foley's neighborhood last year, the killing today was the first known killing of a Western diplomat in the Jordanian capital.
"The war on terror seems to be breeding more, not less," said Rami Khouri, a Jordanian columnist. "There is no sign that anyone in the U.S. or Israel or the Arab world is addressing the grievances that lie underneath all this."
While protesters against a war in Iraq have marched in the West, the repressive regimes of the Arab world have blocked most demonstrations. 
Experts on political Islam also said it was impossible to tell from any of the recent incidents whether they were ordered by some revived Qaeda network or simply individuals acting on their anger. 
"The idea that you should hit the interests of the West is widespread enough for us to take into consideration that there are individuals who don't need a network," said Francois Burgat, a French expert on Islamist groups, when asked about previous attacks this month in Kuwait, Yemen and Indonesia.
The ambassador and several other American diplomats live behind the fortress-like walls of the new embassy compound. Those who live outside, like the Foleys, are protected largely by 24-hour random security patrols that pass by their homes, Mr. Siberell said.
American diplomats are assigned license plates numbered 108 or 109, but Ambassador Gnehm noted that those who did not want them could get ordinary plates. Both Mr. Foley's Mercedeses parked in his driveway and a red Jeep Cherokee parked in front of the house had plates numbered 109. 
Mr. Gnehm said there had been no threats immediately prior to the attack, although the embassy had warned its staff and Americans in Jordan repeatedly since Sept. 11 last year to be extra vigilant. He said he was confident the Jordanian security services could solve the crime, and was satisfied with the security provided by the government, which he said would be enhanced.
Muhammad Adwan, the Jordanian information minister, said in a statement: "The attack, regardless of its motives, is an attack on the country and its national security." 
Mr. Foley was the chief administrative officer for the Agency for International Development in Jordan and a veteran of similar programs in Bolivia, Peru and Zimbabwe. He first worked for the government in 1965 as a Peace Corps volunteer in India. 
Mr. Foley and his wife have three grown children and two grandsons. 
Mrs. Foley had a private practice offering psychological counseling to Jordanians and expatriates, and was also helping the embassy to list the ways the United States was helping Jordan, her friends said. 
In his remarks, Ambassador Gnehm quoted Mr. Foley as telling his wife the night before he was killed, "I am where I want to be, doing what I want to do."
Marcia Rhodes, a water aerobics instructor and a friend of Mrs. Foley, described Mr. Foley as "like a big teddy bear that you just wanted to hug." 
Mrs. Rhodes and her husband, Curt, who works for a group that helps Jordanian street children, said they had lived through the Israeli siege of Beirut in 1982 and the frequent car bombings there, finally leaving when Americans began being kidnapped. 
"If there was equity and fairness on the other side of the Jordan River, then this kind of thing would not happen," Mr. Rhodes said. "I can't tell you that I am not shocked and scared. Some guy may decide tomorrow that morning that I'm the one he wants to target."

HEADLINE: RETRACING A TRAIL: THE SUSPECTS' TRAIL; 
$2 Bud, and a Bundy for Every Bar Stool

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: BELLINGHAM, Wash., Oct. 28 

 BODY:
Serial killers drank here, they say at this bar on Holly Street.
 Its name is the Waterfront Tavern. It is a good bar that should not be judged bad simply because some customers misbehaved so spectacularly, patrons said today. 
 That is what they said in the mid-70's after Ted Bundy drank here. Mr. Bundy confessed to killing 20 women.
They said it in the late 70's, after Kenneth Bianchi drank here before he was arrested in the killing of two college roommates. He and a cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., were later convicted in the Hillside Strangler case in Los Angeles.
They said it over a year ago, after James A. Kinney, who also drank here, was arrested in the murder of a woman found dead off the Mount Baker Highway. He pleaded guilty. 
Now they are saying John Muhammad, accused in the sniper case, drank here.
"I don't know, we just seem to attract them," said Millie Ulmer, the early morning bartender. "This town is full of drifters, but even so, Muhammad didn't look right to me. Little did I know."
Bellingham is a jumping-off place to the Alaskan tundra and the Canadian wilds. The area is home to hippies, yuppies, militiamen, fishermen, American Indians and tramps. People brew applejack in the woods and breed bird dogs.
The tavern opens at 6 a.m., the earliest in town. It has bay windows, cheap paneling and a view of Bellingham Bay. A pint of Budweiser goes for $2 in the morning. All this is what attracted the other men, say regulars who say they remember Bianchi and Kinney and recount local Bundy lore. 
The bar is a stone's throw from the mission where Mr. Muhammad and his teenage traveling companion, Lee Malvo, stayed. Drinks are cheap. Mr. Muhammad drank Budweiser as he whiled away mornings watching cable news and "The Price Is Right."
"He looked clean, and he was very polite and articulate," said Lynne Farmer, the owner. "He always had his own money. He applied for a job, but we threw the application away like we do with all guys from the mission."
Mr. Muhammad did not try to blend in or adjust his personality to charm the locals, as Ted Bundy did. He was belligerent, fellow patrons say; he railed against the United States and spoke up for the World Trade Center attackers.
"I wanted to take him outside when he was cheering for 9/11," said Drew Samdilands, who was drinking this morning before he took his boat out to lay crab pots. "I had a gut feeling about the guy and I wanted to kick his head in, but they probably would have put me in jail."
Despite the guest list, people who drink at the Waterfront described themselves as warm, well-adjusted. Perhaps it was their accepting attitude, they surmised, that let so many notorious characters feel welcome.
"Live and let live," said Pete Davis, who is unemployed. "Of course, we only know after the fact that they're bad guys. I don't know. Maybe we should name sandwiches after them."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 1, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the Waterfront Tavern in Bellingham, Wash., where patrons say serial killers have visited, referred incorrectly in some copies to the spot where the body of a victim of James A. Kinney was found, and referred incorrectly to the view from the bar. The scene was off the Mount Baker Highway, not Interstate 5. The bar overlooks Bellingham Bay, not the ocean.

Aegis Reports Gains From Broadcast Ads

BYLINE:  By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
The Aegis Group in London said it was reaping the benefits of "further clear improvements" in broadcast advertising in the United States since the first half of the year and that it expected results for the year before one-time costs to be "significantly better" than in 2001.
 The statement from Aegis contrasts with last week's announcement by the WPP Group in London that its revenue was falling largely because of the poor economy in North America. 
 Aegis also said that it would appeal a ruling against a subsidiary, Carat USA, in New York State Supreme Court on Friday. A jury awarded $6.8 million to Independent Media Services in New York, which contended that Carat violated a noncompetition agreement when it participated in a review for the account of New Line Cinemas in New York, a division of AOL Time Warner.

HEADLINE: TWO CITIES; 
Where the Jobs Are

BYLINE:  By SETH FEASTER

 BODY:
 Only two fields dominate the top of the Labor Department's list of fastest-growing occupations over the rest of this decade: health care and computers -- including the software that drives them and the networks that link them. 
But a look at the areas that will add the greatest numbers of jobs gives a different view. Here, lower-paying service jobs, like those at fast-food restaurants or in retail sales, top the list alongside the better paying jobs in computers and health care. The job market also varies significantly from state to state, and more surprisingly, perhaps, can vary widely even between nearby cities in the same state. SETH FEASTER

HEADLINE: Well-Received 'Harlem Song' May Close by Week's End 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Despite strong reviews, "Harlem Song," the variety show at the Apollo Theater that chronicles Harlem's history through song, dance, photographs and film, announced yesterday that it would close at the end of the week unless $300,000 could be raised.
 The show, performed Saturdays through Mondays, opened in August and was scheduled to play through the end of the year, with the hope of becoming an annual engagement. But the $4 million production has been running at a loss since it opened -- most recently about $30,000 a week short of the $200,000 it needs to break even -- and the producers said they could not afford to continue. 
 The show has been considered a cornerstone of Harlem's revitalization, which has brought Harlem Starbucks, Old Navy and former President Bill Clinton; it has been seen as particularly important to the Apollo's current $53 million restoration. 
"It generated a whole new constituency and audience base for the Apollo," said David D. Rodriguez, executive director of the theater. "It created tremendous momentum." The show was created by George C. Wolfe, producer of the Joseph Papp Public Theater and director of landmark productions like "Angels in America" and the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Topdog/Underdog."
Producers often post a closing notice in the hope that some investor might save the day. John Schreiber, lead producer of "Harlem Song," said he and his partners were no exception. 
"We believe this show is too important to the city of New York to close," he said, and added: "A corporation, foundation, individual has an opportunity now to be a hero or a heroine and enable this really terrific experiment to continue."
In trying to explain the show's financial struggle, its creators cite a lack of money for marketing and the psychological barrier to drawing downtown New Yorkers up to Harlem for a night on the town. "People are still getting over the fact of going up to Harlem," Mr. Wolfe said. "Hopefully, Manhattan can keep expanding its definition of what comprises Manhattan."
"Harlem Song" has run through its $500,000 reserve as well as $750,000 from the Time Warner Foundation and the New York City Investment Fund, a private fund started by Henry R. Kravis. When the producers approached the city and state for help, they were directed back to the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, which turned them down, Mr. Schreiber said. 
In many ways the show has been a success, drawing more than $2 million in ticket revenue and an estimated $4 million in ancillary retail and restaurant income to the area, according to the producers. One dollar of every ticket sold has been donated to the Harlem Strategic Cultural Collaborative, a consortium of nine arts organizations, including the Boys Choir of Harlem and the National Black Theater.
The show has sold more than 50,000 tickets over the last four months to an audience that is 10 percent to 15 percent tourists; mostly from outside the neighborhood; and 65 percent black and 35 percent white. "Our desire at the get-go, to get rid of that invisible boundary between Harlem and the rest of the city, is succeeding on many levels," Mr. Schreiber said. 
"We have shown people from all over New York City and domestic and foreign tourists that uptown is a great place to visit," he continued, "a great place to see a show, a great place to have dinner and a great community to get to know."
Because "Harlem Song" has been running at a deficit, the producers have not had money to market the show, they said; they cannot afford to broadcast a television spot that features Whoopi Goldberg and would cost $100,000 to $200,000 to broadcast.
Mr. Schreiber said that if the show closes it would be more difficult to bring it back next year, in part because those who have purchased advanced tickets will be left disappointed. The show has an advance of about $900,000 through the end of the year; half of that is from group sales.
The show will also have to abandon its education program; a study guide, just recently completed, was developed with the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.
Even if the show closes, Mr. Schreiber said it may have touring productions and be broadcast on television. Sony is due to release the cast album before Thanksgiving. 
Arts executives and business owners in the area said they would be sorry to see "Harlem Song" end. Michael Eberstadt, the owner of Bayou, a Creole restaurant, and Slice of Harlem, a pizza shop, in Harlem, said his sales had been up 200 percent to 350 percent on weekends and Mondays because of the show.
"One of the really good things that's happened is 'Harlem Song,' " Mr. Eberstadt said. "It should be doing much better than it is."
Lowery Stokes Sims, director of the Studio Museum in Harlem, said the show had benefited other cultural organizations like hers. "It was starting to bring tourism down from the bus and onto the ground," she said. "This is the kind of neighborhood tourism that we were interested in fostering."
The producers failed to gain the financial support of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, one of nine distressed areas designated by the Clinton administration for public financing and tax incentives to spur private investment.
Because "Harlem Song" is a for-profit venture, the producers were asked to apply for aid through the nonprofit Apollo, a producer partner in the show. Nevertheless the application for $1.2 million in empowerment financing was rejected. "They did not respond to us positively," said Charles Flateman, the show's executive producer. 
Terry Lane, president and chief executive of the zone, did not respond to two messages seeking comment. 
Although she is a fan of the show, C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, said "Harlem Song" did not necessarily qualify for empowerment money. "I'm not sure that is the type of project that falls under the empowerment zone purview," she said. "Most of what the empowerment zone has been funding is job creation on an ongoing basis, as opposed to any particular program or service."
Leonard Garment, president of the Jazz Museum of Harlem, who has applauded "Harlem Song," said the show was precisely the type of venture the zone was meant to support. "It's the kind of thing the empowerment zone should be doing," he said. "That's what it was chartered to do."
Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem said he would like to be of help. "Whatever I can do I want to do," he said, adding, "I was hoping the empowerment zone could see its way clear to investing in this."
Gordon J. Davis, founding chairman of Jazz at Lincoln Center, said he was very disappointed to hear that "Harlem Song" may close. "Every day I go around New York, people ask me about it, and I say, 'It's terrific, you should go,' and they say, 'Yeah, I've been meaning to go, I've been meaning to go,' " he said. "And once they know about the closing notice, all those people will say, 'Oh, I wish I'd gone, I wish I'd gone.' "

HEADLINE: TRADE WINDS; 
Global Trade in Elmwood Park: Familiar Saga With a Twist

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: ELMWOOD PARK, N.J. 

 BODY:
WHEN legislation making it easier for the United States to enter new free-trade agreements was passed last summer, reactions were black and white.
 President Bush called the trade promotion authority bill, formerly known as "fast track," "a victory for the American economy" and dreamed aloud of free trade pacts with Chile, Singapore, Australia and Morocco, the nations of southern Africa and the democracies of the Western Hemisphere. The President sees trade as a means of increasing exports and creating more than enough jobs to compensate for those that will inevitably be lost to foreign imports. 
 Unions doubt it. John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., calls fast track "a blank check to send good jobs overseas." 
But the picture from this industrial city, and in particular from the site of a former factory that produced televisions for the JVC Corporation, is anything but black and white. Six years ago, the factory closed and its operations and 198 jobs were moved to Tijuana, Mexico, partly to take advantage of incentives that were created with the 1994 signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but also because of the $3.50 daily wages Mexican workers generally receive. 
Here, new jobs eventually emerged after JVC's departure, though not as many jobs that were lost. And the reason for those new jobs had less to do with the expansion of global free trade than with the expansion of another local business, a successful one with a convenient but overcrowded location.
At first, the loss of JVC was a heavy blow for this compact borough of 18,000 people on the banks of the Passaic River in Bergen County, about 11 miles west of New York City. Suddenly gone were not only the jobs but also $180,000 in taxes that the property rendered annually. "Sure, we were worried," said Richard A. Mola, who has been mayor for 31 years, "but what could we do?"
The move caught JVC's workers by surprise. "The last Christmas before JVC closed, the president came and said there was no chance that the plant was going to move," said Janina Zylik, who had spent eight years on the assembly line, fitting electronic works into television cabinets.
"Then a week before the layoffs they told us that was the end," added Mrs. Zylik, a native of Poland who is 62 years old. "All they said was that they were moving to Mexico."
Many JVC workers collected unemployment after the plant closed. Some went for retraining through the government assistance program. Mrs. Zylik's daughter, Beata, who also worked at JVC, took maternity leave, and has remained at home to raise her family.
Nelson Silva operated a forklift at the plant and was shop steward for Teamster Local 810, which represented most of the JVC workers in Elmwood Park. He is now vice president of Local 810 and considers himself "one of the lucky ones," because he found a new career.
"But for many others it was horrible," he said. Guillermo DeLeon's options were limited. When he lost his job on JVC's shipping line, his wife was six months pregnant. He said he would have liked to have gone to school to learn computers or pick up some other skill, but he needed to find a new job with health benefits immediately. He collected unemployment for two months before landing a job at the Sharp Electronics Corporation in Mahwah, N.J., for slightly more than the $9 an hour he had earned at JVC. 
"Just covering the cost of having the baby was difficult," said Mr. DeLeon, 41, who lives in Paterson. He later bounced from job to job looking for better pay or greater security. Finally, in 1998, Local 810 helped him and two other former JVC employees find warehouse jobs with, of all companies, JVC, which has a distribution center in Pine Brook, N.J.
Only a few of the JVC workers in Elmwood Park actually lived in the borough, which for much of the last century was named East Paterson because of its proximity to that big-shouldered city and the industries that thrived there. In more recent years, however, the community became uncomfortable with the industry it once embraced.
By the mid 1960's, being linked by name to Paterson and its rusting mills caused embarrassment. In 1973, the borough of East Paterson voted to change its name, choosing Elmwood Park because it seemed serenely suburban and it enabled the police to keep the same initials -- E and P -- on their cars. 
In keeping with this notion, some industrial land in Elmwood Park was subsequently rezoned as commercial space, suitable for the hotels and office buildings that matched the community's suburban aspirations. 
But it was industry that continued to pay much of the borough's freight. Right on Market Street, for instance -- and near the entrance to the JVC plant -- is one of the borough's largest taxpayers and its biggest employer, Marcal Paper Mills.
Marcal has been making tissues, paper towels and toilet paper in Elmwood Park since 1939, growing so strongly that in the mid-90's the company planned a major expansion. 
There was one big problem. Marcal was hemmed in by the Passiac River, Interstate 80 and residential streets. The company was bursting out of its headquarters, an old silk mill from an era that had also faced competition from cheap imports. 
The solution turned out to be next door. When JVC's three television assembly lines were shipped out, most of the 175,000-square-foot building was emptied. The company continued to use a small section as office space, but in 1998 moved its corporate headquarters to Wayne nearby, leaving the building vacant. 
Marcal agreed to buy the JVC plant and its 11 acres. By shifting warehousing operations there, Marcal freed up enough space in the main manufacturing building to install a $70 million papermaking machine. The improvement meant Marcal could expand a line of bathroom tissue products that brought in new business for the company, which recorded $300 million in sales last year.
"JVC was a dream come true for us," said Nick Marcalus, who with his brother Peter operates the company that was started in 1932 by their grandfather, Nicholas Marcalus. Without obtaining JVC's space, he said, Marcal would have had to expand elsewhere in the country.
"That acquisition gave us a chance to expand our business here," Mr. Marcalus said. "Without that building, it would have been imprudent for us to put in a new paper machine and expand our output." 
Marcal did not hire many former JVC workers, Mr. Marcalus said, because more than two years elapsed between the end of JVC's manufacturing operation and the start of Marcal's expanded production line. 
It did hire Janina Zylik. 
Though stunned to be suddenly out of work when her former employer moved south, Mrs. Zylik did not even apply for the trade adjustment assistance for which she was eligible. Her husband, Mieczyslaw, already was a machine helper at Marcal. She took off six weeks to have a knee operation, then applied for a job at Marcal. She was hired to work on the packaging line, and is now paid about $12 an hour, $4.50 more than at JVC. 
"It's a good company," she said of Marcal. "Whoever wants to work can work." 
Mrs. Zylik's production line handles bathroom tissue produced on the machine that Marcal installed after acquiring JVC's building. The machine is largely computerized, with a few supervisors overseeing the work. 
Marcal has put on 100 additional workers to package, ship and sell the increased work, Mr. Marcal said. That number is equivalent to about half of the employees displaced when JVC left. With the additions, Marcal's total employment is 1,000 workers, most unionized, on 88 acres. 
Marcal's move into the old JVC space also ensured that local delicatessens and convenience stores hardly noticed JVC's absence.
In assessing the effect of moves like JVC's, Daniel T. Griswold, associate director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group, said that trade had little long-term impact on the overall number of jobs because the American economy tended to create jobs in more sophisticated industries to replace those that are lost. Moreover, he added, televisions are manufactured more efficiently and cheaply in Mexico.
"That means that an American family that goes into Wal-Mart is going to get a television for a lower price or one of a higher quality at the same price," Mr. Griswold said. "When 198 jobs in New Jersey are lost, that makes headlines, but the fact that millions of American families can more easily afford a television set doesn't."
Guillermo DeLeon, who now works in the JVC shipping department, does not see it that way. "There we are, packing and shipping televisions, VCR's, DVD players from all over the world that could have been made here," Mr. DeLeon said. He thinks that the additional free trade deals that President Bush wants to sign will only increase the exodus of manufacturing jobs in the United States. "This is not good," he said. 
Nick Marcalus said he supported expanding free trade, but disagreed with what he considered hasty decisions of other manufacturers to leave the United States for cheaper wages across the border. 
"Unfortunately," Mr. Marcalus said, "many companies that have moved out of the Northeast underestimated the ability of the work force to learn and adapt."

Aid for Displaced Workers: Is It Enough?
THE first federal law to help workers hurt by trade was enacted in 1962 and modified several times since. In 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement provided a new set of benefits that applied only to workers who could prove they were displaced because their employers moved to Canada or Mexico. 
According to a report by the General Accounting Office in 2000, the number of workers covered by both Nafta and the general trade assistance program averaged 167,000 annually between 1995 and 1999. The report also found that while most workers who received assistance, which averaged $870 a month for up to one year, found new jobs, about half took at least a 20 percent pay cut. 
In a trade promotion authority bill that passed last summer, the Nafta benefits were eliminated because the two programs were combined into one. Coverage was extended to farmers and some secondary workers, and the coverage period was extended from a year to 78 weeks. 
Displaced workers age 50 or older were declared eligible to receive additional payments if their new jobs paid less than their previous ones. And workers who lose jobs because of free trade will be eligible to receive tax credits to cover 65 percent of the cost of health insurance coverage. 
But in the heated debate leading to the bill's passage, other proposals were dropped. These included extending benefits to secondary workers hurt by a plant closing -- for instance, those who might have made plastic parts for a television cabinet -- and to service-industry employees and contract workers who typically held jobs in high-technology companies hit hard by the economic downturn.
Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who sponsored the assistance extension legislation and helped get the trade promotion authority bill (formerly called the fast track bill) passed in the Senate, has said that tens of thousands of additional workers will be eligible for benefits under the new law. But Fred S. Azcarate, the executive director of Jobs With Justice, a national group that advocates workers' rights, said that if the President can use the trade promotion bill to get new trade deals through Congress, the new adjustment benefits would fall far short.
"Workers should be extremely worried," Mr. Azcarate said. ANTHONY DePALMA

HEADLINE: The Greatest Threat 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The scariest place in the world right now is not Iraq, but rather the Korean peninsula.
 We're being blackmailed by a nuclear power, and so President Bush is in an exceptionally difficult situation -- one that he has handled very ably so far. But the administration's game plan to isolate North Korea is, as our allies are desperately trying to tell us, potentially catastrophic. 
 President Bush wants to squeeze North Korea into abandoning the uranium enrichment program to which it recently confessed. We're almost certain to cut off fuel oil shipments to North Korea. 
Unfortunately, the moment we cut off oil shipments and apply economic pressure, North Korea may kick out international inspectors at its nuclear plant in Yongbyon. Then it may threaten to "uncan" the plutonium rods there, preparatory to using them to make nuclear bombs.
North Korea has enough plutonium in Yongbyon to rapidly make at least five nuclear weapons, possibly more. That's its leverage: threatening to turn Yongbyon into a nuclear assembly line, which in turn might ultimately lead Japan and South Korea to go nuclear as well.
So play the scenario out. We cut off fuel oil and introduce sanctions. Then North Korea revives Yongbyon and threatens to uncan the plutonium. From there, it's easy to imagine the U.S. bombing Yongbyon (both the first Bush and the Clinton administrations had contingency plans to do just that), after which North Korea lashes out with artillery at Seoul.
I called Kim Myong Chol, a North Korean unofficial spokesman, who said his country would respond to sanctions not just by reviving Yongbyon, but also by ramping up weapons exports.
"North Korea can export missile and nuclear technology to the highest bidder," he noted dryly. "It's a capitalist practice."
"If America tries to knock out Yongbyon," Mr. Kim added, "North Korea will retaliate immediately on New York and Washington, wipe out South Korea, wipe out Japan."
(I observed to Mr. Kim that I was speaking from Midtown Manhattan. "Well okay," he said obligingly, "maybe not New York. Washington and Chicago instead.")
In fact, North Korea's ballistic missiles probably can't reach the continental U.S. Still, North Korea's artillery can destroy Seoul. Don Oberdorfer, in his book "The Two Koreas," cites an estimate from a former American commander in South Korea that a war could kill one million people, including 100,000 Americans.
Dear Leader Kim Jong Il may also feel that the focus on Iraq gives him more room to push the U.S. around.
"North Koreans firmly believe that the U.S. cannot now make a military strike, because South Korea is a hostage and because of the Iraqi situation," said Han Park, an American scholar who has often visited the North. "That may make North Korea a bit more reckless."
So what should we do?
Donald Gregg, a former ambassador to Seoul who is president of the Korea Society, says imposing sanctions on North Korea "would be crazy." Likewise, a military strike is not feasible, given that it would probably trigger a new Korean war.
On the other hand, how can we accept a North Korea with a large nuclear arsenal? How can we continue to ship fuel oil to the North as if nothing had happened?
That leaves only one alternative, holding our nose and negotiating a deal with North Korea (without ever calling it negotiating, and possibly using proxies like China). The North would give up its nukes and missiles, all sides would agree to end the hostilities of the Korean War (there never was a peace treaty), and Western countries would normalize relations with the North. 
"The way to distinguish the hawks from the doves in this administration is the speed with which a person realizes you have to talk to the North," explains a longtime player. "The doves are already there. The hawks are struggling with, and resisting, the notion."
In the coming months, the most delicate problem in international relations will be how to negotiate an end to this crisis. If all sides play their cards wisely, we could not only defuse the confrontation, but also launch North Korea on a path like the one China pursued away from Stalinism.
North Korea is the most totalitarian country in the world, and possibly the most dangerous adversary we face. But that's precisely the reason we need to engage it.

HEADLINE: Cigna to Feel Major Loss In Customers 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
The Cigna Corporation said yesterday that it would lose at least 530,000 members this year and surrender its longstanding position as the nation's third-largest health insurer.
 By January, Cigna will cover fewer than 12.7 million people, well behind UnitedHealth Group, which has 16.2 million, and Aetna, with 14.4 million. It will also trail Wellpoint Health Networks, which recently grew to 13.1 million members. 
 Cigna has lowered its official membership count to 13.25 million people from 14.15 million, based on what it said was more accurate information. And membership is dropping 4 percent to 5 percent after some acknowledged bad management decisions. 
"There were just some flat-out poor judgments," H. Edward Hanway, the chairman and chief executive of Cigna, said in a conference call with analysts to discuss the company's third bad-news announcement in five days.
Shares of Cigna fell 81 cents yesterday, to $38.58, on top of a 38 percent loss on Friday. The company said on Thursday that its earnings would be lower than expected in 2002. On Friday, it lowered its profit estimate for 2003.
James Stewart, the chief financial officer, said the company would take a relatively modest $100 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter for costs of revamping. For example, Cigna is adding employees to improve service to customers, reversing layoffs earlier this year after new computer programs failed to work out and complaints multiplied.
Cigna said it lost $40 million to $50 million this year after it cut prices and the costs for thousands of new members were higher than expected. When Cigna then raised its rates, some of these customers switched to other insurers, Mr. Stewart said.
The company said that more than half the loss came on the worst case, which analysts identified as the Dade County school employees in Miami. A consultant to the Dade schools said Cigna lost $50 million there.
Analysts said Cigna would face perilous times through next year and beyond, which could result in the replacement of Mr. Hanway and his team, as happened after financial crises at Aetna and Oxford Health Plans. 
Tom Goetzinger, a health care analyst at Morningstar, said that Cigna had "announced five charges within a month, including more than $1 billion involving businesses they aren't in any more."
"They are beginning to look like a company that doesn't know what it's doing," he said.
Mr. Stewart said Cigna had decided to dip into "internal funds," and cancel previously announced plans to borrow $200 million, to help offset heavy charges it had incurred in its business of selling reinsurance to other companies to cover their risks in writing variable annuities.
Mr. Hanway said the decision not to borrow now was based in part on Cigna's debt-to-capital ratio, which is approaching 32 percent, above the company's goal of 25 percent to 30 percent. He said Cigna planned to pay down part of the debt next year.
Noting that several credit-rating agencies have raised questions about Cigna's finances, Mr. Goetzinger said, "they may need to borrow more money at more expensive rates." Higher interest payments could affect profitability.
Company officials noted that, unlike Aetna and Oxford, Cigna is still making money, albeit in reduced amounts, in all its lines, including health care. But they acknowledged that Cigna's problems would extend into next year.
Two-thirds of the company's health care customers have already signed contracts for 2002, many at rates that Cigna now regards as underpriced.
While some of this business is ending, and the company says it is solving its computerized information system problems, Roberta Walter, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said she expected "both issues to persist into 2003."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: SENATE; 
New Hampshire Rivals Look to Independents

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Oct. 24 

 BODY:
The most potent campaign commercial so far in New Hampshire's neck-and-neck Senate race is one that in other states might be considered milquetoast. 
 An advertisement for the Democratic candidate, Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, features her opponent, Representative John E. Sununu, pledging his loyalty to his party, saying he has "never done anything that I thought politically wasn't in the interest of the Republican Party." 
 In some states, that might be a plus. But in New Hampshire, there is a premium on independence. 
The number of unaffiliated voters keeps rising year by year -- it is now 37 percent of the electorate -- and polls show the two candidates virtually even, with Mr. Sununu leading in latest survey by 48 percent to 46 percent, well within the four-percentage-point margin of sampling error.
So although this race may determine which party controls the Senate, the candidates have made a point of courting independent voters by emphasizing their differences with their parties.
Mr. Sununu's spokeswoman, Julie Teer, rattled off six issues on which he disagreed with the Republican leadership, notably financing for the Superfund toxic-waste cleanup and other environmental programs. By contrast, Mr. Sununu himself said in an interview here:
"Jeanne Shaheen was asked on national television to name one issue on which she differed with party leadership. All she could come up with were regulations under the Clinton administration, and that has nothing to do with the current Democratic leadership."
Ms. Shaheen countered in a subsequent interview: "That's the difference between John Sununu and myself. I haven't spent a lot of time looking at where the Democratic leadership is on issues. But there are a couple of big issues where I disagree with Tom Daschle. When John Sununu says he's never done anything that wasn't in the best interest of the Republican Party, he wasn't kidding. That's been his record even when it wasn't in the best interests of the people of New Hampshire."
Polls suggest that Ms. Shaheen's strategy has helped her. After trailing since the September primary, she has pulled even.
A poll this month by the University of New Hampshire had her leading by three percentage points among all voters, 47 percent to 44 percent, and by 15 points among independents, 49 percent to 34 percent. The most recent poll, taken Oct. 20-22 by the American Research Group, a Manchester group, showed Mr. Sununu ahead by two points, 48 percent to 46 percent, with 6 percent undecided. 
"The gap is closing, and it started with Shaheen running the ad having Sununu saying he always supports the Republican Party," said Dick Bennett, president of American Research Group. "That was the first thing that really stuck with the independent voters."
Both candidates are respected, well-known politicians with long political legacies in the state. 
Ms. Shaheen, 55, is in her third term as governor after six years in the State Senate, and analysts attribute her electoral success to her ability to portray herself as a moderate in a state where only 26 percent of the voters are Democrats.
Mr. Sununu, 38, is a third-term congressman whose father, John H. Sununu, was governor of New Hampshire and then chief of staff to the first President Bush. 
"They are both very good politicians, they are both savvy, they both won re-election twice," said J. Mark Wrighton, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire. "It really is a battle of heavyweights."
Earlier this year, Mr. Sununu pulled off an unusual feat, beating an incumbent senator, Robert C. Smith, in a grueling primary. While he raised less money than Senator Smith and faced some accusations of disloyalty, he won support from prominent Republicans inside and outside New Hampshire who were convinced that Mr. Smith was strident and out of touch.
It was during the primary that Mr. Sununu made his statement about his support for the Republican Party, a stance that probably helped mollify some critics. But he retains some enemies among Smith supporters.
Mr. Smith endorsed him but has been noticeably absent on the campaign trail and turned down a White House invitation to attend a Sununu rally, saying he had a family commitment.
Mr. Sununu is conservative on fiscal issues and opposes abortion except in cases of rape or incest or danger to the pregnant woman's life. 
Ms. Shaheen supports abortion rights, but also President Bush's tax cut and his policy toward Iraq. 
"The tension over Iraq that Republicans have been using in other races, she's really neutralized that," said Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. "That's always been the thing that she's very adept at, which makes Republicans crazy. She takes issues that are hard for Democrats and takes them off the table."
While both candidates are considered effective campaigners, there are stylistic differences. "Shaheen has learned to create a presence when she walks in a room, but Sununu could walk in a room and you wouldn't notice him," Mr. Bennett said. 
At a recent campaign stop at a health clinic in Newmarket, Ms. Shaheen was personable, chatting enthusiastically with the nurses.
On the campaign trail in Manchester, where Mr. Sununu was meeting Latino business owners with State Representative Carlos Gonzalez, the congressman's low-key style was on full display.
At Star Fashions, Mr. Sununu quietly handed the proprietor a flier from his back pocket, said, "I'm walking through with Carlos; appreciate your vote on Election Day," and left, humming softly to himself.
What schmoozing he did was unobtrusive, almost shy.
And on the streets of downtown Manchester, Mr. Sununu did not stop to shake hands with passers-by, walking so quickly that he blew right past Tom Evans, who called a greeting to the congressman while unloading wares from his truck. Mr. Sununu doubled back and said, "I'm John Sununu." Mr. Evans said: "I know who you are. I just wanted to shake your hand." 
To which Mr. Sununu replied: "I'm not the kind of politician who goes around assuming people know who I am. It's not good form."
Ms. Shaheen, who had no primary fight, has raised more money than Mr. Sununu, but both candidates are getting hefty helpings of support from their parties and national interest groups.
In the campaign, Ms. Shaheen has focused on appealing to several influential constituencies: Republican-leaning women who support abortion rights; older voters concerned about health care; environmentalists, and small-business operators who have been hurt by the sluggish economy.
Mr. Sununu accuses Ms. Shaheen of flip-flopping on issues. He particularly criticizes her record on financing education, an issue that has dogged her since 1997, when she proposed a statewide sales tax after the courts said the schools' reliance on property taxes could penalize poor districts.
When the Legislature rejected the sales tax, the governor's solution was an interim statewide property tax, not terribly popular in this antitax state.
Interviews with voters suggest that both candidates are making headway with their arguments. 
Jayme Hansen, 44, of Somersworth, who runs a window-repair business, is a Republican-leaning independent who said he would support Mr. Sununu. "I have to go with Sununu, who has been there in Washington," he said. "I haven't been impressed with what the governor did for the state over the past six years. Education in this state is terrible." 
Another independent voter, Kylah Riendeau, 23, a student at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, said she would vote for Ms. Shaheen, partly because of the abortion issue. "I don't agree with the idea of a sales tax, but I don't think Sununu better represents us either," she said. "I feel Sununu doesn't represent a lot of my interests, and Shaheen's the lesser of two evils."

HEADLINE: Pataki, McCall and Friends Stump in New York City 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
The Republican and Democratic candidates for governor scrambled for votes in New York City yesterday, pulling out powerful allies to help them campaign.
 Gov. George E. Pataki toured Republican enclaves in the city and Nassau County with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor, while Comptroller H. Carl McCall got a boost from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton at a fund-raising breakfast. 
 The Independence Party candidate, Tom Golisano, had intended to campaign in the city as well, but remained in Rochester because of mechanical problems with his private airplane, his aides said. 
Mr. McCall, trailing in polls and going into debt, also unveiled a sharp-elbowed television advertisement accusing the governor of having no principles. "When you stand for nothing, you'll stand for anything: mediocrity, failure, even corruption," Mr. McCall says in the 30-second spot. Mr. Pataki called the ad "unfortunate" and said that people wanted new ideas instead of "negative personal attacks."
The governor seemed relaxed and confident on his whirlwind tour of the metropolitan area with Mr. Giuliani, acting more like a man on a sightseeing trip than someone in the middle of a competition. He and the former mayor had breakfast with local businessmen in Woodside, Queens, and then spoke to high school students at nearby Christ the King High School about American values.
The two men, once bitter political enemies who made peace last year, shared a game of boccie and scarfed down hot dogs with a group of elderly citizens in Franklin Square, on Long Island. Then they tried their hand at making pizza at a restaurant in New Hyde Park. They took a walk along commercial strips in Brighton Beach, shaking hands, patting children on the head and speaking to crowds. They also shook hands with commuters at Grand Central Terminal, rode the Staten Island Ferry and held a political rally in Gravesend with Democrats for Pataki.
At every stop, Mr. Giuliani praised the governor for his handling of the crisis after the Sept. 11 attack and said the state needed his experience as it confronts possible future terrorist attacks, economic troubles and a budget shortfall.
"Without Governor Pataki, we would have not gotten through the last eight years and certainly not from Sept. 11 on," Mr. Giuliani said in Franklin Square. "He really is a terrific human being."
Mr. McCall, too, brought out a popular politician, Senator Clinton, to give his flagging campaign a helping hand, at a breakfast for female supporters, including the poet Maya Angelou, at the Sheraton Towers in Manhattan.
"Sometimes it's not easy doing what has to be done to talk about difficult issues, to withstand powerful forces, and that's what Carl McCall has tried to do his entire life," Mrs. Clinton said.
Senator Clinton acknowledged that Mr. McCall's chance to win was slim, but added, "You can't overlook the kind of message that Carl has, of opportunity and education and hope" and urged his supporters to continue fighting.
Mr. McCall also campaigned on Staten Island, speaking at a church with a predominantly black congregation and visiting a home for the elderly. Wrapping himself in rhetoric about overcoming obstacles and improving education, he told his supporters to ignore reports that his campaign had not caught on.
"You've heard about the polls," he said. "You've heard the pundits saying things don't look good. I don't believe that."
Mr. McCall may not have the money to broadcast his message, however. If not for $2 million in loans from his running mate, Mr. McCall's campaign for governor would have been $1.27 million in debt by the middle of this month, according to campaign finance reports released yesterday. The loans came from Dennis Mehiel, a multimillionaire businessman running for lieutenant governor.
The need to rely on Mr. Mehiel for money illustrates just how desperate Mr. McCall has become to gather the money necessary to challenge Mr. Pataki credibly. The reports released yesterday provide many examples of just how out of balance the fund-raising contest is. By Oct. 21, the last filing deadline, the governor had raised $42.8 million and spent all but $3.6 million of it, with most of the nearly $40 million going toward television commercials. Mr. McCall had raised $14.7 million -- including the $2 million in loans -- and spent $14 million, leaving him with $722,285 in the bank.
Besides the loan from Mr. Mehiel, the largest source of donations to Mr. McCall during the three weeks covered by the reports was $500,000 from the New York State Democratic Committee. Another $122,500 came from high-profile Democrats: Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, United States Representative Charles B. Rangel, United States Senator Jon S. Corzine and Andrew M. Cuomo, his former opponent.
Aside from these politicians, only 11 other individuals gave $10,000 or more to Mr. McCall, while 38 people each gave $10,000 or more to Mr. Pataki.
Strategists on both sides say the contest has become static. McCall and Pataki aides say internal polls suggest that Mr. Pataki has a commanding lead among likely voters, with somewhere between 40 and 45 percent of the vote. Mr. McCall has been stuck between 25 and 30 percent. Mr. Golisano remains in third place with less than 20 percent in most polls, though his aides maintain he is doing better than that.
Mr. Golisano, too, has resorted to aggressive attacks on Mr. Pataki's ethics. Yesterday he charged the governor's campaign with failing to reimburse the state for the use of state aircraft for political events since 1999. Mr. Pataki said the allegation was baseless. Records show the Pataki campaign did give the state the small sum of $573 in May 2002 to cover travel for the entire year of 2001. They do not plan to pay for the governor's 2002 travel on state airplanes until next spring, aides said.
The campaign generally picks up half the cost of a plane if the governor does political events that are mixed in with run-of-the-mill announcements deemed to be state business, Pataki aides said. The governor's campaign has spent about $91,000 on chartered aircraft for campaign travel this year.
"It's not true," the governor said of Mr. Golisano's allegations. "We have made sure that we reimbursed."

HEADLINE: Draft Charter for Europe Points the Way to a Bigger World Role 

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
A draft constitution for an enlarged European Union was unveiled today, pointing the way toward creating a greater European presence on the world stage. But as it heads there, Europe has to decide on a name. 
 The draft document was prepared under the leadership of Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former president of France. It seeks to raise Europe's profile by proposing common foreign, security and defense policies. 
 These policies are now handled by national governments. Britain and France, for example, sit on the United Nations Security Council, but the European Union is not a member of the United Nations.
Eastward enlargement of the 15-nation union was the main factor that prompted the review of the European Union's constitution. In 2004, the union is expected to take in 10 new members, largely from the former Soviet bloc to the east, almost doubling its size.
With about 445 million citizens, the European Union will have a much larger population than the United States, something the drafters of the constitution want reflected in its role in international affairs. 
The draft constitution leaves many of the questions it poses unanswered. The 15-page document is little more than a skeleton containing chapter headings.
The debate about its final shape will continue through to next summer, when a final version will be handed over to heads of state for ratification.
The draft constitution examines the role of the European Union's foreign policy chief, currently Xavier Solana, with a view to elevating the position to the level enjoyed in the United States by the secretary of state. 
It also suggests creating an elected president for the union and a Congress of the Peoples of Europe, consisting of members of both European and national parliaments. 
The expansion of the European Union will require new ways for the organization to operate internally. The draft constitution seeks to curb member states' rights to veto important union decisions.
"There'll be very few cases left" that require a unanimous vote, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said at a news conference last week after a meeting with European heads of state. 
Then there is the question of what Europe plans to call itself. The document suggests four names: the European Union, as it is now called, the European Community, United Europe, or -- most contentious of all -- the United States of Europe. 
"This translates into nothing less than a constitution for a federal E.U. state," said Jens-Peter Bonde, a Dane who is a member of the European Parliament but who is considered a Euroskeptic. 
"There will be opposition from those who think there is too little democracy in this," he said, "and opposition from those who like me say this is the creation of a state and not cooperation among states." 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 30, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about a draft constitution for the European Union misspelled the given name of the union's foreign policy chief, whose position would become more powerful. He is Javier Solana, not Xavier.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: THE HOUSE; 
Chads and Butterflies Give Way to Social Security and Prescription Drugs in Florida

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Oct. 26 

 BODY:
Like so many other local Florida officials, Tom Feeney and Carol Roberts took the short and bumpy ride from obscurity to renown in the protracted 2000 presidential election.
 Mr. Feeney, speaker of the Florida House, made headlines when he threatened to have the Republican-controlled State Legislature appoint a special slate of electors for George W. Bush. Ms. Roberts, a Democratic county commissioner in Palm Beach, was a fierce supporter of Al Gore at the very center of the recount battle. 
 But this year, as they hit the campaign trail for themselves, running for Congress in different districts, they have found that the election that vaulted them to prominence is now two-year-old ancient history.
"People don't care about that," said Mr. Feeney, who has not made his role in the 2000 vote an issue in his own campaign. "People care about prescription drugs, war and the economy."
Ms. Roberts, who does not side with Mr. Feeney on much, agrees with him on this. She was recruited by Democratic officials in Washington because of her steadfast demand in 2000 that every one of the county's disputed butterfly ballots be counted by hand. But as a candidate herself, Ms. Roberts has played down her role in the election fiasco.
"I believe I defended democracy," she said, "but the issues are the issues of today."
For Ms. Roberts, who is challenging Representative Clay E. Shaw Jr. in the 22nd District, running from Palm Beach to Broward County, including Fort Lauderdale, the most pressing issue is the price of prescription drugs. Perhaps the most talked-about part of her campaign is her telephone line, 1-866-RX-CAROL, which encourages the elderly to buy prescription drugs from Canada over the Internet -- a practice she admits is illegal, though few if any patients are prosecuted for it.
"Our neighbors in Canada can buy the very same F.D.A.-approved drugs for two to three times less than we pay," Ms. Roberts tells callers in a taped message. She urges them to leave names and addresses and says, "I will send you information on purchasing drugs from Canada."
Mr. Shaw, an 11-term incumbent from Fort Lauderdale, dismissed the telephone line as an inappropriate ploy. Never mind that such drug purchases are illegal, Mr. Shaw says, "the Food and Drug Administration says it is dangerous do that."
Ms. Roberts acknowledged that the practice might not be entirely legal but said that no one was being prosecuted and that the drugs came from manufacturers approved by the Food and Drug Administration. She said her number had received more than 3,000 calls from people seeking cheaper prescriptions.
Mr. Shaw said he was seeking another term to continue working on legislation to protect Social Security and provide prescription drug assistance to the elderly -- by legal means. Beyond the prescription phone line, he said, his opponent has not distinguished herself in the race and is "just beating up on me."
Mr. Feeney, a conservative Republican with strong party ties in Washington, is running against a Democratic lawyer, Harry Jacobs, in the newly redrawn 24th District in Central Florida, which includes the Kennedy Space Center.
While Mr. Feeney has not brought up the 2000 election in this campaign, he has not been shy about promoting his ties to Republican Party insiders, including J. Dennis Hastert, the House speaker, and Tom DeLay, the majority whip. 
"There is no question that in a legislative body relationships matter in terms of committee assignments in the short and long run, and the appropriation process going forward, and with perhaps having a seat at the table when key decisions are made," said Mr. Feeney, whose platform includes property tax relief, homeland security issues and generic drug availability.
Mr. Feeney was the subject of an investigation by the Florida Commission on Ethics into whether he used his position as speaker to benefit clients of his law firm. He. said there was no merit to the accusations, which he called politically motivated, and the panel concluded this week that there was not enough evidence to support them.
Mr. Jacobs contends that Mr. Feeney has long been motivated by personal interest instead of public service. "He has crossed the line between what is right and what is wrong in representing private agencies and private clients," Mr. Jacobs said. 
With the investigation behind him, Mr. Feeney is considered tough to beat, especially by a first-time candidate with little name recognition in a heavily Republican district. 
Like Mr. Feeney, another Florida Congressional candidate, State Senator Ginny Brown-Waite, is receiving campaign help from the national Republican Party. Ms. Brown-Waite is seeking to unseat Representative Karen L. Thurman, a Democrat, in the Fifth District, in the northeast corner of the state, in a close race that is considered the most competitive in the state. Vice President Dick Cheney campaigned for her at a Tampa fund-raiser this week, and Mr. Hastert and Mr. DeLay have also lent their support.
"With a margin as close as it is, this seat is important to both parties," said Ms. Brown-Waite, whose campaign has focused on a pledge to oppose moves to privatize Social Security.
Not to be undone by the Republican Party support for her opponent, Ms. Thurman has also had a lift from her party in Washington. The Democrats tapped her this month to respond to President Bush's weekly radio address, giving her a national platform for focusing on her central campaign issue, lowering prescription drugs costs.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 31, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A map on Tuesday with an article about Florida Congressional election campaigns located three districts incorrectly, and the article misstated the location of the Fifth District.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: Dell Chief Says Hardware Demand Is Improving 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Michael Dell, the chief executive of Dell Computer, said yesterday that worldwide demand for computer hardware had improved and that the Far East would be a good market for the world's biggest personal computer maker. "Globally, we've seen some rebound in overall demand," Mr. 
Dell said at a news conference in Tokyo, where he introduced the company's smallest desktop computer. "There's great opportunity for Dell, especially in Japan and the Asia Pacific." Dell surpassed the Hewlett-Packard Company in the third quarter to again become the world's biggest personal-computer maker, the market researcher IDC said earlier this month. Mr. Dell, above, reiterated that a rebound in PC's will be driven by improvement in corporate customers' profits. "We continue to face a challenging market in an economic sense around the world, but Dell is succeeding by maintaining a relentless focus on customers," he said. Shares of Dell, based in Austin, Tex. fell 10 cents yesterday, to $28.94.

HEADLINE: Arts Groups And Artists Find Angels: Universities 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
As artists and arts organizations find themselves facing yet another brutal decline in financial support, they are increasingly turning to a small but growing corps of universities that are quietly helping fill that gap.
 The colleges are providing not just rehearsal facilities, technical support and audiences but also money for new works. 
 One of the most ambitious examples was the recent decision by Columbia University and the University of Michigan to invest $2 million in a stage production of Salman Rushdie's novel "Midnight's Children," to be performed by the Royal Shakespeare Theater at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, in Ann Arbor and in England.
In the last 15 years or so Ohio State University, the University of Iowa, the University of Michigan, the University of California and Miami-Dade Community College have poured tens of thousands of dollars into helping established artists like Mark Morris and the Joffrey Ballet as well as newcomers like Rokafella and Kwikstep, hip-hop artists from New York.
A college may contribute only $5,000 or $10,000 to sponsor a new work. But combined with four other contributions, that can add up to $25,000 to $50,000. 
Some of the money may be taken from the university arts centers' general budgets, including ticket sales and university subsidies, and some is raised from individual patrons and foundations specifically for commissioning.
No one has a firm count of how much money the universities or anyone else invests in new works each year, but experts like Sam Miller, executive director of the New England Foundation for the Arts, estimate that roughly two dozen universities are active in commissioning now. 
The University of Michigan is typical. Its University Musical Society has brought orchestras, theater companies and dancers to Ann Arbor for more than a century. But until a decade ago it did not think of itself as an originator of new works. Now it regularly commissions three or four new works a year, usually in partnership with other universities and arts centers.
"A decade ago it was satisfactory to put on a good gig and cross your fingers that you would make money," said Kenneth C. Fischer, the society's president. "Then there was a change in the climate and the sense of responsibility to do more. Now we put commissioning money in our budget, and it is a commitment each year, just like Xeroxing." He said a study about the role of performing arts organizations in the late 1980's helped change his thinking. 
Universities are not the only commissioners, of course. But with philanthropic giving and other arts revenues falling, they have come to stand out more. And foundation executives like Olga Garay, program director for the arts at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, argue that universities should be doing even more. "There are pockets of this kind of activity," Ms. Garay said, "but there hasn't been a field-wide acknowledgment of what these universities should aspire to."
Others, however, like Thomas Bender, a historian at New York University, express concern that the universities, too, will be forced to pull back.
"Universities have been rich enough in the past decade to embark on such things," Professor Bender said. "With a crashing economy, I worry a bit whether they will be able to do this work. And if not them, who?"
Many of the universities say they feel a sense of obligation to support the creative arts. Some see it as a means of enriching the cultural life on campus and beyond. Others believe it adds to their prestige and helps attract better faculty and students. Still others hope to make better use of handsome, well-equipped performance centers.
"When you build a new performing arts center, you want to say that art is not only about the past but about the present, too," said Leon Botstein, president of Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. He said he plans to commission more work when Bard's new arts center, designed by Frank Gehry, opens next spring.
"We don't have a patronage class the way we did with Rockefeller and Carnegie," Mr. Botstein said, "and we don't have government funding like European societies do, so educational institutions have to step into the breach."
Artists who have received commissions say their work can help introduce art forms to students. "The type of work I do is a great catalyst for kids, and certainly college kids," said Elizabeth Streb, whose New York dance company, Streb, is known for the way its dancers run and crash into things. "We are not doing step dancing or pirouettes, but falling 30 feet or diving through glass walls. I think students think differently after they see us, and then go to see other dancers. We're pretty good bait."
Ms. Streb has received money or residencies or both from several universities, including the University of Illinois (the Krannert Center for the Arts gave her $25,000 for "Action Heroes"), Ohio State (the Wexner Center for the Arts commissioned "Up," her first trampoline dance, gave her a residency to work on it and also commissioned a sound score for it), the University of California at Berkeley and George Mason University.
But other artists say the efforts to involve faculty and students do not always work smoothly. Paul Dresher, a composer and artistic director of the Paul Dresher Ensemble in San Francisco, says he sometimes finds tensions between the presenters who give him commissions and the academic departments.
"It is not uncommon that I'll be on tour and the music departments won't want to have anything to do with us," he said. "It gets into the area of turf. Turf is a major part of the academic reality."
Still, he said, the university presenters, "are aesthetically committed to new work in a way that very few commercial presenters are."
One of the most active campuses has been the University of Iowa, which has commissioned or co-commissioned more than 80 works since 1986, including "Ghost Opera" by Tan Dun for the Kronos Quartet, "Geometry of Miracles" by the Canadian director Robert Lepage, and the Joffrey Ballet's "Nutcracker," for which Iowa put up $500,000, about a third of the cost. In return, Joffrey performed at the university, used dozens of local children in its performances and visited with students at the university and in the community.
One of the works Miami-Dade Community College is supporting on its $100,000-plus annual commissioning budget is a tango/opera that will have its premiere in Buenos Aires in November and probably in Miami next year. Like most of the colleges, Miami-Dade raises much of its commissioning money from foundations and other private donors and has developed a loyal audience.
At other universities, budgets are more modest. The University of California at Davis, which has a $7 million annual performing arts budget, spends about $40,000 on commissioning. It supported several new works, including a fanfare for brass ensemble and a piano quintet by faculty members for the opening of its Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts this month. And Brian McCurdy, the center's director, said he hopes to do more.
"This is a uniquely American phenomenon," he said. "There is nowhere else in the world where universities play this role, having major arts centers on campus and being major arts centers for their regions. It is certainly easier to sell tickets for Yo-Yo Ma or Itzhak Perlman, who we also present. But one of our goals is to try to develop an audience for new work."
Not all universities see commissioning of established artists as a good idea. Mary Schmidt Campbell, dean of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, said that Tisch preferred to focus its resources on its students.
"We think of this place as a crucible for new work by our students, and we invite directors and actors in to work with them," she said.
The interaction between American colleges and artists is not new. Lynn Garafola, a dance historian and critic at Barnard College, recalled how Martha Graham and Doris Humphrey did some of their most important work in the 1930's at Bennington College, when the college provided housing, studios and performance space during the summers.
At some universities, commissioning started through the efforts of one professor, like Roberta Uno, a theater professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and longtime artistic director of its New World Theater. Thirty years ago she began commissioning new work out of frustration that there were so few works by minority playwrights to present.
At other universities commissioning has been shaped by the people who line up performances for their campus performing arts centers. At the University of Iowa, for example, it was Wallace Chappell, who was director of the university's 2,500-seat Hancher Auditorium from 1986 to 2001 (and now works for American Ballet Theater in New York). He said his previous theater experience, which included directing at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, led him "into a strong taste for the rigors and risk of new work -- 'moving the art form forward.' " 
But, he added, he had strong backing from university officials and worked to develop a constituency for new work and donors to support it.
Some of the university commissioners, like Judy Mitoma, director of the seven-year-old Center for Intercultural Performance at the University of California at Los Angeles, say they think of their work as the equivalent of science research, but in the arts.
"Just as we have research in medicine," Ms. Mitoma said, "we have research into the creative process."

HEADLINE: BP Results Fall Short And Targets Are Lowered 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
The cold reality of a slowing economy is grinding the optimism out of BP.
 The company reported earnings for the third quarter today that fell short of expectations, and said that, for the third time in two months, it had to lower its oil production targets for 2002. 
 While rivals like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch/Shell have tended to set modest targets, BP had been aggressive, aiming for growth of 5.5 percent to 7 percent for the year. As recently as Oct. 2, the company said it was still hoping for 4 percent growth; now it is aiming for 3 percent, in line with its more cautious rivals. 
BP said the latest downward revision was attributable to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and technical problems at operations in Alaska and Britain. Some analysts said that the earlier goals had not been realistic given the economic climate.
Lord John Browne, the chief executive of BP, said he was conducting a review to determine whether the company could meet its targets for 2004 and 2005 of 5.5 percent a year. Doing so, he said, would require investments of about $1 billion a year.
Investors reacted to the disappointing news by bidding BP's American depository receipts down 7 percent, to $36.63, its lowest level since 1998. Shares of Exxon Mobil and the British and Dutch halves of Royal Dutch/Shell also traded lower.
Until recently, BP had been known for meeting and even exceeding the ambitious targets it set, a reputation that makes the production cutbacks more alarming, analysts said.
"This is a company that had a lot of credibility attached to management, and that credibility is damaged now," said Philip Lawlor of Royal London Asset Management. "It looks as if management isn't in control of the company's affairs."
BP has suffered a series of setbacks recently, including an an explosion at a well in the Greater Prudhoe Bay area of Alaska and problems with a pipeline running from Britain to Belgium. But analysts said the company's problems were more fundamental than those temporary setbacks, and that they extended to the entire industry.
"Production at mature oil fields in Alaska and the North Sea are declining faster than new fields are coming on line," said Bruce Evers of Investec Henderson Crosthwaite.
For the third quarter, BP said its earnings, excluding one-time items and amortization costs, had fallen nearly 14 percent, to $2.29 billion, from the third quarter of 2001. Net income for the period rose 78 percent, to $2.84 billion, because of $1.77 billion in exceptional gains.

HEADLINE: Oil Pipeline Forges Ahead in Ecuador 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: MINDO, Ecuador 

 BODY:
Environmentalists in this cloud forest of northern Ecuador still dream of halting construction of a new oil pipeline that the builders said could bring spectacular wealth to this poor Andean country. But with the 300-mile-long, privately financed pipeline now 70 percent complete, and long green tubes replacing the palm and canelo trees, even the most die-hard opponents acknowledge that stopping the construction is next to impossible.
 The announcement this month that the big Dusseldorf bank Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, or WestLB, would continue financing the project, despite an international campaign pressuring it to withdraw a $900 million loan, appeared to remove the last hurdle for the builders of the $1.3 billion pipeline. 
 "Now, it's full speed ahead," said Ian Davidson, local director of Bird Life International, a conservation group that had opposed the project.
After two years of acrimony by a strong, well-organized opposition that frequently disrupted construction, such admissions could not be more welcome for the consortium of multinational oil companies building the heavy-crude pipeline, known by its Spanish initials, O.C.P. 
But now, as the project enters its final stage, with the builders promising that the pipeline will be on tap next June, questions are being raised by oil analysts and economists over just how much economic impact it will have in Ecuador.
Two years ago, when President Gustavo Noboa and the oil companies began talks for the O.C.P., it was billed as a mega-project that would, in time, help double national daily oil production to 850,000 barrels, and help gross domestic product grow as much as 2.3 percent a year over the next 20 years.
But now, the government and the consortium -- made up of giants like Repsol YPF of Spain and Occidental Petroleum of Los Angeles, and led by EnCana of Canada -- have scaled back the projections.
The builders now say the pipeline will, for the foreseeable future, transport only 220,000 barrels a day, half of capacity. And nearly three-quarters of that crude is oil that is already in production and currently flowing through the country's only other major pipeline, the 30-year-old Trans-Ecuadorian tube known as SOTE, which runs nearly parallel to the new pipe.
More exploration is expected to increase production, but the process is lengthy and expensive. This means that for at least a few years, only a few thousand more barrels of oil will be produced.
"All we are going to get is 15,000 barrels a day for the first three years after the pipeline is commissioned," said Rene Bucaram, president of the Ecuadorean Petroleum Opinion Forum, an influential policy analysis group in Quito. "That's a disaster."
Gustavo Arteta, an Ecuadorean economist for LatinSource, a consultancy based in New York, said Ecuador's policy makers are now just hoping that production will eventually increase from the current 400,0000 barrels a day to 600,000 -- more than 200,000 short of the initial goal.
"The reality of the circumstances is that we will wait several years as a country to get there," Mr. Arteta said in a recent interview in Quito.
Such talk irks Energy Minister Pablo Teran, who believes that Ecuador can one day transport a million barrels a day, most of it for export, making it nearly as important a supplier as oil-rich Venezuela.
The new pipeline, he said, will mean more production because the resolution to the thorny problem of transporting oil from the eastern fields of Ecuador to Pacific ports will spur large-scale investment in exploration.
Mr. Teran says that new blocks like the Ishpingo, Tambococha and Tiputini fields have world-class potential, and that big companies, including Statoil of Norway, TotalFinaElf of France and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, have shown an interest.
He also notes that Ecuador signed a "ship or pay" clause with O.C.P.'s builders, requiring that the companies pay the government for the transporting of at least 390,000 barrels of oil a day, regardless how much is actually produced -- a contract that he says will also encourage exploration.
Ecuador is an important player in the Latin American oil market. It has 2.1 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, and its fields in the eastern Amazon are the most developed in all of Amazonia.
"It's a good basin," Andy Patterson, O.C.P.'s project director, said. "I don't think Ecuador could produce a million barrels a day, but I could see it producing 600,000 to 700,000 barrels a day."
Still, exploration has fallen short because multinational oil companies have cut back on investments, in large part because of Ecuador's decision last year to charge a value-added tax on oil companies, a tax that had previously been refunded.
Investors worry about Ecuador's consistently troubled economy and its traditional political instability, with some increasingly jittery about the possibility that a left-leaning candidate will win next month's presidential election.
"Ecuador is a difficult place to do business," Mr. Patterson said.
Indeed, the fact that it took about a dozen years of proposals and counterproposals for a pipeline project to come to fruition is "evidence of the pervasiveness of corruption and some of the problems that face private investment here," said an official at the American embassy.
Here in the heart of the 47,000 square-acre Mindo Nambillo cloud forest, word that the pipeline may not become the promised economic panacea, at least in the short term, has many local people shaking their heads. For so long, as they tried to stop the pipeline, they were told they were blocking a project crucial to the economy.
Their concern was that the pipeline would tear through the region, which has 450 species of birds -- half as many as all the species in North America -- and many types of butterflies, orchids and trees, and is an important eco-tourist destination.
But little by little, government resolve for the pipeline led environmentalists and tour operators to drop the fight, with some saying they decided it was best to negotiate with the builders to ensure that the work did as little damage as possible.
"I still think it's completely wrong to go through this area," said Richard Parsons, a British transplant here who runs a 10-room bamboo lodge overlooking a sea of green. But Mr. Parsons has allowed the pipeline to go through his property.
"It hurts when I go and see it," he said, "but I have to admit, it's not as bad as I thought it would be."
The builders have promised to use mule trains and a special elevated pulley system to move equipment as they lay the pipeline through eight ecologically sensitive miles. Tractors and other heavy machinery are out, and the right-of-way in which they are allowed to work narrows to just 23 feet here, down from the 49 feet used in other parts of the country.
There are still deep concerns, mainly that seismic activity could cause a break and an oil spill. But most of the environmentalists are now focused on future exploration in the Amazon.
"The controversy of the O.C.P. does not finish with the end of the construction," said Natalia Arias, who has coordinated the campaign against the pipeline for Ecological Action, an Ecuadorean group. "There is a goal to fill the pipeline, and to do this, they have to increase production, and that means opening up new areas of Amazonia to oil production."

HEADLINE: EN ROUTE: SCANDINAVIA; 
Herring, the Fish That Roared

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: ELLOS, Sweden 

 BODY:
CAPT. BO CHRISTIANSON, the skipper of the Ron, a sturdy 115-foot trawler out of Fiskeback, a small port on Sweden's west coast, warned me to be careful. The deck was covered with slippery silver scales. Then he lifted a hatch so I could see the night's catch in the hold below: tens of thousands of beautiful fish, 8 to 10 inches long, with bluish backs, iridescent sides and gold eyes, kept fresh in a bath of refrigerated sea water.
 Herring. Clupea harengus. 
 Men like Captain Christianson have put to sea for centuries in search of herring; Scandinavian burial mounds dating from Neolithic times contain herring bones. Humble though it may be, and about as glamorous as a galosh, it is a fish that has shaped the political and social history of Europe like no other, with the possible exception of cod. The Hanseatic League, the medieval economic guild, came into being because the Germans had the salt that the Scandinavians coveted as a preservative for their herrings, and British and Dutch sea power was built on the back of the herring trade.
Herrings remain a staple in the diets of northern Europeans -- not only the Scandinavians but also the Dutch, British, Germans and others. 
The French grill them and serve them with mustard sauce. The British cool-smoke them, turning them into breakfast kippers. The Germans fillet them, cure them and wrap them around onions or pickles to make rollmops.
We Americans are not great herring-eaters, although we speak of misleading data as "red herrings" (because smoked herrings were once used by poachers to throw dogs off a fox's scent). And we sing of "darling Clementine," who shod her feet, size 9, with "herring boxes without topses."
Smoked, salted or pickled in countless ways, flavored with mustard or curry, tomatoes or dill, Scandinavian herrings have manifold virtues. They keep well, in some cases without refrigeration. They are packed with proteins and healthy oils. They are cheap, versatile and delectable.
At least to me they are, although I admit that every time I tell certain of my friends I'm bound for Sweden, they make sour faces and mutter, "Yuk, herring." I guess they think herrings are slimy or smelly or something. Well, they aren't, not in the hands of a capable cook. Pickled herrings are plump, firm and rich, suffused with the sweetness of the sugar and the contrasting tartness of the vinegar in their brine. Believe me, they beat a shrimp cocktail every time for jolting a jaded palate.
Swedes don't eat as much herring as they once did; there are too many options that didn't exist a century ago. For many people, for example, cereal and yogurt have supplanted herring at breakfast. But herrings are still deeply rooted in national tradition.
"The first new potato of the year is still an excuse for eating herring," said Ulrika Bengtsson, who once cooked for the Swedish consul general in New York and now runs a restaurant on the Upper East Side specializing in husmanskost, or Swedish home cooking. "So is Easter, and so is midsummer, and the midwinter holiday that we call Lucia, and Christmas, of course."
Herrings are, in fact, accorded special status in the Swedish language. A sole or a plaice or a turbot is a plain old "fisk," or fish. But a herring, as Bertil Adolfsson, chairman of the Swedish West Coast Fisherman's Organization, told me emphatically, "is something special: it's a sill, not a fish." A sill, that is, if it comes from the Skagerrak or the Kattegat or the North Sea; if it comes from the less salty Baltic Sea, off the east coast of Sweden, it will be smaller and less oily, and it will be called a stromming.
SINCE time immemorial, herrings have moved in vast shoals, migrating every year from one area to another in seemingly fixed patterns, then mysteriously failing to show up, leaving fishing fleets with nothing to catch. It happened at Marstrand in Sweden a century ago, after many decades when you could scoop the fish from the harbor with buckets; at Scheveningen in the Netherlands in the 1950's, and at Siglufjordur and all over Iceland in 1968. Overfishing was certainly a significant factor.
But for the moment, regulations imposed by the European Community and by Baltic governments appear to have improved the situation. Boats from the Swedish west coast are limited this year to 34,917 metric tons from local waters (the Skagerrak and the Kattegat) and 47,102 metric tons from the Baltic. They were also barred from fishing between June 22 and Aug. 5. 
The week I visited him, Captain Christianson, a fifth-generation fisherman, sailed on Sunday and dropped his net about 9 o'clock that night as the fish rose toward the surface. He lifted it five hours later, then dropped it again for a shorter trawl. By 9 o'clock Monday morning, he was tied up at the Paul Mattson processing plant here in Ellos, 40 miles north of Goteborg on a stretch of granitic, heavily indented coastline much like Maine's.
Grabbing a nine-inch-wide rubber hose awaiting him on the dock, he plunged it into the hold, switched on the pumps and soon 30 tons of herring, plus the chilled seawater keeping the fish cold, were headed into the plant. There, gleaming stainless-steel machinery sorts the fish according to size, culling imperfect ones and sending them to a fish-meal factory. Those that survive go onto six filleting lines. A few fillets are shipped fresh, either directly to Goteborg, to be sold in the city's famous fish market, known as the Fish Church because of its odd Gothic design, or elsewhere. But most go into plastic barrels filled with pickling brine.
That, I had thought, would be it, but no. After they have been filled, the barrels are shuttled to storerooms tunneled into a cliff behind the plant. At any given time, 15,000 of them are stored there, at 32 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit. They stay for up to a year, maturing like casks of wine or brandy. The length of time and the makeup of the brine in each lot is specified by the customer.
About 60 percent of Mattson's output goes abroad, mainly to Germany, and the rest goes to processors in Sweden, like Abba, whose products are widely sold in the United States, or to markets or restaurants. They add sauces or flavorings.
The permutations are endless. At Melanders Fisk, a leading fishmonger in Stockholm, I counted eight varieties, all house-made -- marinated herring (with sour cream), spiced herring, herring in mustard sauce, herring with garlic, herring in curry sauce, herring in tomato sauce, glassblowers' herring and matjes herring. Matjes means maiden, and matjes herring is made from female fish that have not spawned. Glassblowers' herring is made by pouring pickling liquid into a glass jar filled with layers of salt herring, sliced onions, carrots, horseradish root and ginger, and seasoned with allspice, bay leaves and mustard seed.
In the canned and bottled fish section of a typical supermarket in southern Sweden, I counted no less than 24 varieties of herring, many available in several different brands.
I've met plenty of herring I didn't like. I find the odor of surstromming, fermented Baltic herring, unspeakably foul. Sotare, or chimney sweeps, which are herrings grilled until soot-black, don't do a whole lot for me, either.
BUT bockling, or hot-smoked herrings, are a joy, the flesh moist and delicate. And there will always be a place on my table for Janssons Frestelse, or Jansson's Temptation, named for a cleric, opposed on principle to pleasure, who couldn't resist it. It's a simple dish, essentially scalloped potatoes cooked with sliced onions and anchovies. But there's a catch. The anchovies the Swedes use aren't anchovies at all but tiny herrings pickled with sugar and sandalwood. Standard anchovies are too salty.
The various smoked and pickled herrings claim pride of place on the smorgasbord, the traditional Swedish buffet, occupying one end of the table and eaten first. Modern life has been hard on the smorgasbord, which at its most lavish can hold 60 or more items. The resplendent buffet at the Operkalleren in Stockholm, initiated in the 1960's by the great restaurateur Tore Wretman, is no more, but Ulriksdals Wardshus, north of town, still sets a sumptuous table. 
Much more commonly encountered these days is the herring plate as a first course -- tidbits of three to six herring preparations, almost always accompanied by crisp bread or a brown bread flavored with molasses or malt. A boiled potato usually comes along for the ride, and often a slice or two of Vasterbotten cheese as well.
Vasterbotten is a potent item, too little known outside Sweden, with the texture of Cheddar and the bite of Parmesan. Made in 40-pound wheels in the remote province northeast of Stockholm for which it is named, it is aged for 11 months. The best comes from the village of Burtrask.
But cheese with fish? It works; perhaps the sharpness of the cheese provides a counterpoint to the richness of the herring.
Two presentations seemed exceptional to my wife, Betsey, and me as we nibbled herring all across Sweden last summer. One was the fat, luscious matjes filet at Norrlands Bar and Grill, one of Stockholm's hip new restaurants. It came to the table warm, showered with chives and chopped red onion. A kettle of brown butter for dipping came with it. Casual Norrlands may be, but not with food and drink; the mandatory aquavit was served in wittily anthropomorphic mini-carafes called grandmas.
The other winner was offered by Leif Mannerstrom at Sjomagasinet, a seafood Valhalla in Goteborg, housed in an old Swedish East India Company warehouse. At Christmas, he told me, he lays out a hearthside feast including 16 kinds of herring and serves 10,000 people in 22 days.
We settled for less, but it was still remarkable. The herrings came in handsome black iron pots cradled in ice, and the spread included not only pickled herring in horseradish and sour cream but also mild fried stromming. Both were new to us, and delicious. The mustard sauce was better than most, brightened by masses of chopped dill. There were two kinds of Vasterbotten, with cumin and without. And the bottle of aquavit -- O. P. Anderson, Goteborg's favorite -- had its own icy place of honor.
Aquavit, if you haven't had the pleasure, is a caraway-flavored spirit, colorless but lethal. For foreigners, it is often the prelude to a three-hour nap. For Swedes, it is always an invitation to song, much of it ribald. Not surprisingly, the favorite is "Helan Gar" -- roughly "Bottoms Up!"

There Is a Place Just Like Home
ULRIKA BENGTSSON'S warm-hearted, cottage-like restaurant, Ulrika's (115 East 60th Street; 212-355-7069), may be the best place in New York to sample not only the taste but also the look of Sweden. The herring appetizer includes five irresistibly succulent variations on a theme, just a bite of each, plus a couple of small wedges of Vasterbotten cheese and a boiled potato the size of an acorn. All varieties, including mustard, tomato and matjes, are house-made.
Ms. Bengtsson advised Russ & Daughters, the estimable smoked-fish merchants (179 East Houston Street; 212-475-4880), on Scandinavian herring preparations. Russ & Daughters, a bastion of tradition on the Lower East Side since 1914, is the city's herring-to-go headquarters, selling its own pickled herring, mustard herring, beet and herring salad, herring in sour cream, salted schmaltz (meaning "fat") herring, German-style rollmops (herring rolls with onions inside, held together by toothpicks), and new or "green" herring from the Netherlands during a brief season in June and early July. 
Swedish herring is available in Chicago at Wikstrom's Gourmet (5247 North Clark Street; 773-275-6100) and Oakland, Calif., at Nordic House (3421 Telegraph Avenue; 800-854-6435). R. W. APPLE Jr.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
A Disney Resort Remodels for Business Travelers

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

DATELINE: LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. 

 BODY:
The advertisements for restaurants in the Walt Disney Swan Resort and the Walt Disney Dolphin Resort hotels here include a place with "Disney Character Dining Opportunities," as illustrated by a young girl grinning at a person dressed as a dog who holds a thumbed paw the size of a steering wheel atop her blond head. For more sophisticated travelers, a steakhouse, the promotional literature states, features "a pleasant, intimate atmosphere, surrounded by Miami Dolphins memorabilia."
 Marlin Evans, here from Birmingham, Ala., to attend a convention of the Chartered Property and Casualty Underwriters Society, finished his ice cream cone one day last week at the Dolphin Fountain, a malt shop near the lobby. "You do have to accept the fact that you're going to be around children," he said, as Buddy Holly's voice on a jukebox pledged an indefatigable affinity for Peggy Sue. "It's not your typical businessman's place." 
 The Tishman Hotel Corporation, a wholly owned unit of the Tishman Realty and Construction Company of New York that owns these hotels in partnership with MetLife, is spending $75 million to brush away just enough of that imagery to make the Swan and Dolphin hotels, which are operated by the Starwood Corporation, appeal to more business travelers and conventiongoers. 
The task is delicate, in part because the Walt Disney Company owns the ground beneath the hotels and has a veto over any modifications and in part because the site of the two hotels within Disney World makes it imperative that Tishman not turn its back on the family market altogether.
But the company has calculated that it sorely needs the grown-ups. Revenue from the 2,267 rooms, priced from $199 to $405, are expected to fall to about $200 million this year from a peak of $225 million in 2000, according to John A. Griswold, president of Tishman Hotel.
"We're trying to cater to what those markets expect," he said. "For the price that we're charging, they're expecting a little more contemporary, a little more hip."
Travel is still off all over the country, industry analysts say, although leisure travel is rebounding far better than business travel. Average revenue generated by each available hotel room nationally -- the common industry gauge for the real estate side of the travel business -- declined 7 percent in 2001, according to Smith Travel Research. The accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has predicted another decline of 2.3 percent this year.
The Orlando area, with 450 hotels and 109,946 rooms, has been hit especially hard. The area is among the worst in the country for unpaid loans, with $177 million in delinquencies on 29 properties, said Stephen P. Taylor, a managing director in the Florida office of Horwath Hospitality Investment Advisors, a consulting and brokerage firm in San Francisco.
"In Orlando, you've actually got a lot of properties that should have been bulldozed," Mr. Taylor said. "We're underdemolished."
Nationally, though, foreclosures and delinquencies are relatively low. Delinquencies peaked at 5.5 percent of all outstanding loans to the lodging industry earlier this year, compared with a high of 16 percent during the recession in 1991, according to Bjorn Hanson, an industry analyst for PricewaterhouseCoopers.
The reasons include the aversion of lenders to actually running hotels themselves and the fact that most hotels built in the last decade were capitalized with 30 percent equity instead of just 5 percent, he said.
That has been a disappointment for real estate investors who are hoping to buy distressed hotel assets, said Daniel H. Lesser, managing director of the hotel practice at Cushman & Wakefield, the commercial real estate services firm.
"There was a tremendous amount of equity gathering up to seize on this opportunity," Mr. Lesser said. But "buyers are pricing distressed properties off of historical trailing 12-month income and sellers are pricing an asset based on future opportunities, and there's a big spread between the bid and ask prices." 
So transactions have actually declined, he said. 
But the problem for hotel owners like Tishman is that rates for leisure travelers are deeply discounted, and so some hotels, especially in resort areas like Orlando, are hoping to use the lull to remake themselves as business destinations. The reward comes when business travelers take to the skies in great numbers again, whenever that may be.
And a race of sorts has begun. Nearby, Marriott International is building a Ritz-Carlton with more than 400 rooms and a J. W. Marriott with more than 1,000, hoping to attract the same business travelers that Tishman desires.
"It's not unlike the reverse of what Vegas did 10 years ago," said Doris Parker-Grossman, a principal in charge of hotel asset management for LendLease Real Estate Investments, remembering an effort by hotels on the Las Vegas Strip to remodel and become more appealing to families during the early 1990's. "You go after one segment, and if it becomes sluggish or price-sensitive, you go after the other," she said.
Tishman has been going after wealthy American and British families and honeymooners from Japan since it built the hotels here a little more than a decade ago.
After a lawsuit and settlement in the mid-1980's involving covenants among the various companies regarding their marketing, Tishman and MetLife won the right to build the Swan and Dolphin near the center of the 28,000-acre Walt Disney World property, between Epcot Center and MGM Studios. They built 2,267 rooms and 200,000 square feet of meeting space, which has since been expanded to 327,000 square feet. 
The Swan and Dolphin are operated under a land lease from Disney granting Disney a percentage of revenue from the hotels, one that has escalated over the years.
The $350 million complex was paid for with $50 million in equity, half from MetLife, 25 percent from Tishman and 25 percent from Aoki of Japan, a share Tishman bought in the mid-1990's. The balance was paid with construction loans from Japanese banks, and have been refinanced several times as interest rates have fallen. 
The architect Michael Graves decorated the lobbies and breezeways with fountains flowing around cartoonish swans and dolphins and painted the hallways with beach scenes. He decorated the rooms in pink, blue and yellow pastels, with pineapple-shaped wooden lamps and sketches of palm trees on the cabinets and light fixtures. 
A standard-issue hotel ashtray in this setting gives the appearance that a 10-year-old child lives here and frequently entertains George Burns and Tom Waits.
"The focus was very much about kids," said Patrick J. Burke, a principal at Michael Graves & Associates who is in charge of redesigning the rooms. "We wanted to go back and recognize that there are people doing business here."
To Tishman, much of the redesign centers around a new style of bed, white as a nurse's smock in the morning, bursting with down and marketed as "heavenly."
"The heavenly bed is a huge deal in the hotel industry," Mr. Griswold of Tishman said. "The guests want to see this fluffy, thick, pillow-topped mattress."
All this emphasis on the bed has been a challenge to the designers, and the nonnegotiable requirement for white comforters was a sign that the new room design would not revolve around the tastes of families with small children, Mr. Burke said.
"There was a press release they sent to us to see if there was anything we wanted to add, and it was a story about the bed," he said. "It's a good bed, it's a comfortable bed. I don't think I have anything to add."
The new beds will be complemented by a lower dresser with more workspace, room safes that can hold laptop computers, natural maple headboards and frames and tiled entryways.
Mr. Griswold said Tishman is also finalizing a deal with Todd English, a chef who owns restaurants in Boston, New York and Las Vegas, to open an upscale seafood restaurant in the hotel with a spacious private dining area, a raw bar and a lounge.

HEADLINE: Russia's Poison Gases 

BYLINE:  By Christopher Chyba; Christopher Chyba, codirector of Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation, served on the National Security Council staff in the Clinton administration.

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif. 

 BODY:
More than 100 hostages are dead after Russian authorities used an unidentified gas to incapacitate terrorists holding 750 people in a Moscow theater. Nearly all of the deaths were due to the gas, which Russian authorities have so far refused to identify.
 Press coverage has rightly emphasized grief and the question of why antidotes were not immediately available. It has then focused on whether the Russians' use of gas was a violation of the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. But this focus, while important, risks overlooking the big picture when it comes to Russian chemical weapons. 
 The Chemical Weapons Convention is a global treaty with more than 170 signatory nations. It bans the production, acquisition, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons -- the first arms-control treaty to outlaw an entire class of so-called weapons of mass destruction. It also requires its signatories to declare and destroy, by certain deadlines, the chemical weapons they possess.
Since the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of chemical and biological weapons in war -- a reaction to gas attacks in World War I -- the world has struggled to ban these weapons. In part, this is because of their indiscriminate nature.
After Sept. 11, 2001, it seems all the more important to eliminate stocks of such weapons because access to them could confer such power to terrorists. In a world with 70,000 metric tons of chemical weapons agents, some of which may be vulnerable to terrorist theft, the verified elimination of these weapons will be a step toward greater security for all. This is true despite the disturbing fact that Iraq, North Korea and certain other nations are not parties to the convention.
The weapons convention permits the production and use of riot-control agents for law enforcement purposes. Until the Russians inform us of the agent used, whether they were in violation of the convention will remain uncertain. But renewed attention to Russian chemical agents should focus on a more important issue. Russia retains some 40,000 tons of chemical warfare blister agents and nerve gas. It is required by the convention to destroy them, and the United States and European nations have agreed to help. But American efforts under the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program are stalled in Congress.
The Cooperative Threat Reduction program began in 1992. It provides expertise and funding to help the former Soviet Union secure and destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and materials. Progress with chemical and biological weapons has been especially slow, and the Russians have too often been less than forthcoming.
Of particular concern has been the Russian stockpile at Shchuch'ye, a town near the southern border with Kazakhstan. The Shchuch'ye stockpile contains nearly two million artillery shells -- and hundreds of missile warheads -- filled with nerve gas or other chemical weapons. Although stockpile security has been upgraded with help from American financing, the threat of insider theft remains real. Many of the shells are in working condition, and they are small and easily transportable.
Cooperative Threat Reduction funds have paid to design a plant for construction at Shchuch'ye to destroy these weapons securely and safely. The Pentagon wants $130 million for construction in the new fiscal year. Russia, its economy still weak, won't do this without American assistance. But the program is currently stalled in a Congressional conference committee due to a disagreement over granting the president authority to proceed with the project.
The Bush administration's new national security strategy has emphasized the destruction of weapons of mass destruction by pre-emptive strikes if necessary. But at Shchuch'ye alone, the United States could destroy more than 5,000 tons of ready-to-use weapons of mass destruction through a different kind of pre-emptive strike -- action by a Congressional committee.

HEADLINE: William F. Treiber, 94, Retired Fed Official 

 BODY:
William F. Treiber, a longtime senior official of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, died on Oct. 22 at his home in Bloomfield, Conn., according to a spokeswoman for the bank. He was 94. 
 Mr. Treiber joined the bank in 1934 and was its No. 2 official, or first vice president, from 1952 until his retirement in 1973. In the position, Mr. Treiber was an alternate member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making body of the Federal Reserve. 
 In June 1970, Mr. Treiber helped prevent the financial disruption caused by the collapse of the Penn Central Railroad from spreading into a broader crisis. Over the weekend that the railroad failed, Mr. Treiber sat at his kitchen table in Connecticut and called top executives at the major New York banks. The Federal Reserve, he told them, was prepared to release additional money to stave off a financial panic. 
After retiring, Mr. Treiber advised the central banks of Armenia, Lithuania and Oman.
He is survived by his wife, Betty; a daughter, Elizabeth Ahrens, of Winchester Center, Conn.; a son, Andy, of Barton, Vt.; and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence at 9-Year Low, a Warning on Economy 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In a report that was seen as a warning signal for the economy, the Conference Board said yesterday that consumer confidence in October plunged to a nine-year low. 
 The board's index of consumer confidence, which measures current and future expectations, fell to 79.4 from 93.7 in September. It was the biggest one-month drop since October 1990. And it was the lowest reading on consumer confidence since November 1993, when the index stood at 71.9 and was rising as the effects of a recession tapered off. 
 The data also showed expectations on conditions six months from now to be sharply lower.
The report startled Wall Street and initially prompted sharp selling of stocks, though later in the session they recouped much of their losses.
In advance of yesterday's data, most economists expected the confidence reading to be around 90. 
"This is bad, but it is just one month," said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, which is based in New York. "It has the potential to bounce back."
Nonetheless, Mr. Goldstein acknowledged that the October reading put the index "very close" to recession levels. "This is not good news for the White House," he said. 
The confidence figure is the first of several important economic reports this week. Analysts said coming data on third-quarter economic growth and unemployment in October were likely to reinforce the notion that the recovery was losing steam. With less than a week left before tightly contested midterm elections, these economic reports could influence the choices of some voters. 
Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said: "If we had gotten the consumer confidence number three months ago or even a month ago, it would not have mattered because people weren't paying attention. Now they are."
He continued: 'We have an election that will be decided at the margin of the margin. You don't need a major tide to turn Senate races from one side to another. And if a sour mood is what is prevailing, the odds are that at the margin it will hurt the 'in' party."
Referring to President Bush's political strategist, Mr. Ornstein said, "If I were Karl Rove, this is the last thing I would want to see happen." 
According to the Conference Board survey, consumer sentiment about current conditions fell for the fifth consecutive month. What made the overall decline so significant, Mr. Goldstein said, was that expectations for conditions six months from now fell for the first time, to 80.7 in October from 97 in September.
"All of this is happening three to four weeks before the start of the holiday shopping season," he said. "Absent some sort of big change, this will likely have an impact on Christmas sales."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares End Mixed, Despite Souring of Confidence

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market managed to bounce back from big losses yesterday despite an unexpectedly steep drop in consumer confidence, which fell to its lowest level in nine years.
 After the release of the confidence report by the Conference Board at 10 a.m., the Dow Jones industrial average fell 170 points, or 2 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 22 points, or 2.5 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index declined almost 37 points, or 2.8 percent. 
 But in the late afternoon, stocks managed to bounce back, wiping out most of the day's losses. Some investors may have responded in the belief that the worst news on corporate earnings and the economy is behind them, and in turn decided to take advantage of the market decline to snap up more stocks. 
If this is the view of many investors, it will be tested on Friday with the release of data on unemployment and manufacturing in October. The results are expected to be weak.
Another reason investors may have bought stocks yesterday was their belief that if the 15 percent plunge in confidence for October is followed by unexpectedly weak jobs and manufacturing data on Friday, the Federal Reserve could cut its benchmark short-term interest rate when policy makers meet next week.
Some economists, however, discounted the importance of the consumer confidence number because it does not always correlate with consumer spending. Many consumers probably replied to the survey before the stock market rebound, which began on Oct. 10, had fattened their portfolios, they added.
"Clearly, this is a negative number for the market," said Mat Johnson, an economist at Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco, referring to the confidence index, which fell to 79.4 from 93.7 in September. "However, we would caution about reading too much into this October figure," he said, "particularly given the early October backdrop of the dockworkers shutout, which by some accounts would result in a certain double-dip, and the heightened exchange between the U.S. and Iraq, and the sniper shootings in the D.C. area."
At the close, the Dow was up 0.90 point, or 0.01 percent, at 8,368.94, while the S.& P. 500 was off 8.08 points, or 0.9 percent, to 882.15. The Nasdaq fell 15.29 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,300.54.
Among the stocks leading the Dow higher were Procter & Gamble, which said that its profits rose 33 percent in the recent quarter. Its stock jumped $3.26, or 3.8 percent, to $89.01. Exxon Mobil, which fell $1.41, or 4.1 percent, to $33.23, was a drag on the S.& P. 500, while Qualcomm, which fell $1.70, or 4.8 percent, to $33.69, pushed the Nasdaq lower.
Though stock investors may have decided to discount the consumer confidence plunge, bond investors did not. They sent the price of the Treasury's 10-year note up 1 6/32, to 103 16/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 3.94 percent from 4.09 percent on Monday.
The yield on the Treasury's two-year note fell to 1.76 percent from 1.90 percent on Monday. With the Fed's benchmark overnight rate at 1.75 percent, the move of the two-year yield to 1.76 percent yesterday was a sign that more investors may be expecting a Fed rate cut next week.
The dollar dropped sharply in value against the euro and the Japanese yen after the consumer confidence report was released. But the dollar bounced back against the euro. Late in the day, a dollar was worth 1.0150 euros, off just slightly from 1.0158 euros on Monday. The euro was worth 98.52 cents, up marginally from 98.44 cents on Monday. The dollar rebounded less against the yen, ending at 122.68 yen, down from 123.64 yen a day earlier. 
Consumer confidence had been expected to dip slightly to 90 by Wall Street forecasters. The fact that the decline was much sharper is especially worrisome because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the country's gross domestic product. The plunge to 1993 levels may also worry many politicians who are anxious about Congressional elections that are just a week away.
Expectations for a Fed rate cut have flip-flopped a lot recently. The new shift in favor of a rate cut could again prove short lived. 
Mr. Johnson of Thomas Weisel Partners said that the jobs and manufacturing data are the crucial numbers for the Fed and would have to be especially weak to prompt any action. He did not expect a rate cut.
When policy makers last met in September, they left the benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks unchanged at 1.75 percent. But two policy makers dissented in favor of an immediate rate cut. In the following weeks, the hopes for a rate cut raised by the dissenters diminished as other Fed policy makers indicated they did not consider a rate cut necessary.
In the last week, though, indications from the Fed have put a rate cut back on the expectations table.
Even before the consumer confidence decline, many economists were already forecasting a slowdown in the fourth quarter, after projected growth of 3 percent to 4 percent growth in the third quarter.
"The consumer has been the stalwart of the expansion, but the consumer is showing clear signs of fatigue," said Joseph Liro, an economist and market analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates.
"This is a thread in a tapestry, and the other threads are unraveling," he said. His firm is predicting that the economy, after adjusting for inflation, will slow to 1.5 percent at an annual rate this quarter, from a forecast 4.5 percent in the third quarter.
The decline in stocks comes after a rally that pushed the three key market gauges up for three consecutive weeks. During the rally, investors appeared to be buoyed by the positive earnings surprises, which were running a bit more than normal. So a pullback after the deluge of earnings reports was likely this week.
But in the back of investors' minds has been the outlook for the economy. The reports this week could bring the weakness in economic growth back to the forefront.
On the earnings front yesterday BP, Europe's biggest oil company, depressed the shares of American oil companies when it lowered its forecast of oil production for the year to 3 percent growth over 2001. ChevronTexaco dropped $3.43, or 4.7 percent, to $70.15.

HEADLINE: Next on the Syllabus, Romeo v. Juliet 

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK 

 BODY:
Kafka was a lawyer.
 That fact got the discussion started on a recent afternoon in a sunny seminar room at the New York University School of Law, where 17 law students and 2 professors gather every week for a sort of book club, for credit, in a class called Law and Literature. 
 "I can't say he liked being a lawyer," Catharine R. Stimpson, the dean of the university's graduate school of arts and sciences, told the students. "I can't say he liked law school. Any alienation law students might feel is mimicked in Kafka's interior experiences." 
Stephen Gillers, the vice dean of the university's law school, chimed in.
"The curriculum he studied at law school included Roman law, Austro-Hungarian statutory law, common law, administrative law, criminal law, commercial law and international law," he said. "Some of it was quite similar to what we study."
And some of it was not. Law and literature courses, which are now taught in about 40 percent of American law schools, are a recent innovation. Their place in the curriculum has not met with universal approval, and even the field's supporters sometimes have a hard time articulating a pedagogical rationale.
There are nods to the value of cultivated taste, to a deep understanding of the human condition and to the relationship between good books and good writing. But many proponents of the law-and-literature movement cite another reason.
"One of the natural urges of even serious folks like law professors and law students is to have a good time every once in a while," said Richard Weisberg, a professor at Cardozo Law School and one of the field's founders. "There is the sheer delight of stories."
Professor Gillers agreed. "What could be more fun than reading novels and getting paid for it and getting credit for it?" he asked.
On another level, such courses represent an effort to inject discussions of ethics and values into a curriculum that is sometimes criticized for being too narrow.
"Within the law school environment, I am convinced that there is no better medium to teach the individual law student about professional responsibility than stories," Professor Weisberg said.
The great skeptic in the field is Richard A. Posner, a federal appeals court judge in Chicago. Judge Posner is usually associated with the field of law and economics, which contends that economics can help provide answers to many legal questions.
"Lawyers and judges will not become better people," he wrote, "by trolling in literature for ethical insights."
To the frustration of the field's proponents, Judge Posner's book-length critique, "Law and Literature," is the most frequently assigned nonfiction book in such classes and shadows any discussion of the field. The book has little good to say about the usual rationales for studying literature instead of torts, but it does concede that lawyers could use a lesson or two in straightforward, stylish writing.
The "emerging law and literature canon," according to a 1995 report by Elizabeth Villiers Gemmette of a survey of 84 law schools with such classes, includes five books assigned at 20 or more of the schools: "Billy Budd," by Herman Melville; "Measure for Measure" and "The Merchant of Venice" by William Shakespeare; "The Stranger," by Albert Camus; and "Antigone," by Sophocles.
The N.Y.U. seminar's syllabus is more eclectic. It includes some of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, works by and about Oscar Wilde, and "Anatomy of a Murder" by Robert Traver. 
Last week's assignment was "The Trial," Franz Kafka's account of the mysterious proceedings brought against Joseph K., a banker seemingly guilty of nothing more than self-importance and thoughtlessness. It is No. 6 on Ms. Gemmette's list.
The class had been given a perverse writing assignment. Students were told to imagine themselves as lawyers advising Joseph K. on how to obtain clemency in the proceedings. 
Professor Stimpson said there was "an interesting uniformity in the papers."
"Joseph K. was advised again and again to eat humble pie," she said. "None of you used the word 'grovel,' but the word did come to mind."
Florence M. Kramer, a student, gave her client this advice in her paper: "If you were completely innocent," she wrote, "you wouldn't be a man."
Eryn A. Bingle was in the minority. She advised Joseph K. to flee.
"From a legal ethics standpoint, you might have an action against me," she said in class, to laughter. "I surely would have gotten him killed, I think."
The force of Kafka's work in the actual world of law is undeniable and rising, Professor Gillers said. The term Kafkaesque did not appear in any reported court decision before 1970. In the next decade, judges used it 26 times. It was used more than 100 in each subsequent decade, often in a way that trivializes or misrepresents Kafka's work.
Justice Antonin Scalia, for instance, in dissenting in a case allowing a disabled golfer to ride in a golf cart, called the majority's reasoning Kafkaesque.
Other uses of the term, Professor Gillers said, seem more fitting.
The Louisiana Supreme Court used the term in requiring that a translator be provided for a Brazilian citizen accused of rape who said he spoke only Portuguese. The alternative, the court said, was "a Kafkaesque specter of an incomprehensible ritual which may terminate in punishment."
Students who did summer work in the offices of prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers said "The Trial" had a documentary quality. It captured, they said, the pressure the justice system placed on bewildered defendants to plead guilty.
"In terms of seeing how problematic the system is, it's definitely reality," Sara K. White said.
One parallel to the real-world legal system, she wrote in her paper, was in an insistence on contrition.
"Refusal to accept guilt is customarily seen as lack of remorse," she wrote, "translating into higher sentences and a reduced chance of parole." She noted that some of the men accused in the gang rape of the Central Park jogger, whose guilt has been called into question by D.N.A. evidence, were treated more harshly by the legal system for this reason. 
Judge Posner is critical of those who would find insights about the actual functioning of the justice system in Kafka. "It is like reading 'Animal Farm' as a tract on farm management," he wrote.
Allison Podell, one of the 14 women in the class and an aspiring professional writer, said in an interview that the course had inspired her. Her Kafka paper took the form of a short play.
"These books are about the fundamental questions of justice," she said.
She was asked why she thought only three men had enrolled in the course.
"Most of the men that I know don't want to waste their time," she said. "Most of my guy friends who want to pursue a career in corporate law don't want to take their eye off the ball."
Toward the end of the class, Professor Stimpson asked a question: "How many of you have ever been stuck in a truly horrendous system?" 
"Law school," several students murmured.

HEADLINE: Fuel Economy Below Late 80's Levels, E.P.A. Says 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
The average fuel economy for the new 2003 model cars and passenger trucks is 20.8 miles a gallon, the Environmental Protection Agency reported today, about 6 percent below the high point set 15 years ago. 
 Among those with the best fuel economy, the share of the new models getting more than 30 miles a gallon dropped to 3.5 percent from 5.5 percent a year ago. Only 33 of the 934 cars, trucks and vans listed in the 2003 model statistics are that efficient, compared with 48 of 865 models available last year. 
 In 1987 and 1988, before Americans developed a fascination with gasoline-hungry sport utility vehicles, the fleet averaged 22.1 m.p.g. 
"Clearly, it is disappointing that more than 15 years after fuel economy peaked, fuel economy is still hovering around an all-time low," said David Friedman of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Berkeley, Calif. "And yet the technology is out there. We could be averaging close to 30 to 40 miles per gallon, and that's with conventional technology: nonhybrids, better engines, better transmissions, improved aerodynamics." 
This year, three hybrid gas-and-electric-powered entries -- the two-seat Honda Insight coupe, the five-seat Toyota Prius and Honda Civic sedans -- were at the top of the list of fuel-efficient cars. 
In the last year, Congress by a wide margin rejected any substantial increase in fuel-economy requirements.
Industry executives argue that automakers give buyers what they want. "The cost of fuel is not as important as many other vehicle characteristics such as the utility of the vehicle, how many passengers they can carry, cargo and towing and safety features," said Ron DeFore, a spokesman for the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, which lobbies against government fuel-economy rules. 
Automakers are required to meet standards set by Congress in 1975 for their entire fleet of models, not specific ones. The required average is 27.5 m.p.g. on fleets of new passenger cars and 20.7 for light trucks, including pickups, minivans and sport utility vehicles. 
But the average fuel economy for cars in the 2003 fuel economy list is 23.6 m.p.g., marking a continued decline from 23.9 for 2002 models and 24.2 in 2001. For S.U.V.'s, vans and pickup trucks, the average is 17.6 m.p.g., down from 17.9 for 2002 but above 17.3 m.p.g. for 2001. 
Big S.U.V.'s like the Chevrolet Suburban, Avalanche and Tahoe and the GMC Yukon and Yukon XL burned fuel at a rate of 12 m.p.g. Cargo and passenger vans averaged 15.7 m.p.g., followed by standard pickups at 17.1 and four-wheel-drive S.U.V.'s at 17.3. Minivans from DaimlerChrysler -- the Chrysler Voyager, the Town and Country and the Dodge Caravan -- had the best overall mileage, 23 m.p.g., in the passenger van category. 
Among cars, the best achievers by size class were compacts at 26.1 m.p.g., followed by small station wagons at 24.6 and subcompact cars at 23.3. Of midsize cars, the Pontiac Vibe and the Toyota Corolla Matrix reported the best combined city-highway mileage of 32 m.p.g., an increase from last year's 28 m.p.g.

HEADLINE: Hospitals Battle For-Profit Groups For Patients 

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
As doctors in some of the most lucrative fields of medicine rush to invest in upstart specialty hospitals, community hospitals around the country are striking back by stripping the defectors of medical privileges or setting up physician groups to compete against them. 
 The raw battle for profitable patients is unraveling longstanding relationships, setting doctors against doctors and pitting health care entrepreneurs against established institutions. 
 The rebellious doctors, seeking new ways to make money in an era of falling reimbursements, are joining with a number of small companies to build hospitals specializing in fields like orthopedics, cardiology and oncology and sending their patients to the new facilities.
The community hospitals worry that they will lose patients whose fees subsidize money-losing services like emergency rooms and care for the poor. "You cannot stand by and watch people rip whatever profitable veins there are in the institution away from you," said Michael Curtin, the board chairman of Mount Carmel Health System in Columbus, Ohio. 
Mount Carmel has threatened to deny privileges to doctors if they divert too many profitable patients to a $30 million, for-profit orthopedic hospital in which they are investing, sending costlier cases to the community hospital. Without privileges, a doctor cannot practice medicine at a hospital.
Hospitals in Columbus are also embarking on an aggressive campaign to convince the community, including state legislators, that the new hospital threatens their ability to provide essential services and care for the poor.
"We're going to do everything we can to make sure they're not successful," Mr. Curtin said.
The doctors who are building the hospital, New Albany Surgical, say that they are simply trying to offer their patients the best care. "In order to gain control over how a hospital is run, you have to be an investor," said Dr. Carl Berasi, an orthopedic surgeon who has practiced in Columbus for 18 years. "What's good for patient care is we all compete for patients." 
Many hospitals have long ignored doctors' forays into competing businesses, like outpatient surgery. But the proliferation of specialty hospitals -- led by little-known private companies like Surgical Alliance, which is building the New Albany hospital -- is prompting more to take action against what they view as disloyalty on the part of longtime colleagues.
The American Hospital Association, in response to the concerns of some of its members, recently created a task force to look into the issue, including its impact on hospitals to provide care to their communities. The trend "may exacerbate the development of a two-tiered health care system," said Carmela Coyle, a senior vice president at the association.
OhioHealth, which operates three hospitals in Columbus, plans to deny privileges to any doctor who invests in New Albany -- a policy, like Mount Carmel's, that would apply to other competing facilities, as well. 
"It is one of the few means we have available to fight these specialty-hospitals threats," said David P. Blom, the chief executive of OhioHealth. OhioHealth estimates that the nonprofit hospital group could lose as much as $25 million a year in revenue to the new hospital.
Federal law prohibits doctors from referring Medicare patients to health facilities, like laboratories, in which they have invested, but there are many exceptions. Representative Gerald D. Kleczka, a Wisconsin Democrat, sponsored legislation last year with Representative Pete Stark, a California Democrat who wrote the original law, to amend it to include specialty hospitals.
The doctors "are taking the easiest and most profitable cases out of the community hospital," Mr. Kleczka said. He has asked the General Accounting Office to look into the issue.
"These things are popping up all over," Mr. Kleczka said, expressing concern that the proliferation of specialty hospitals may be contributing to the Milwaukee area's rising health care costs. "Employers are screaming bloody murder." 
States including Ohio, Indiana and New Mexico, where there is little official review of new hospitals, have had a flurry of activity by for-profit companies forming partnerships with doctors to start specialty hospitals. 
New York requires a certificate of need and generally prohibits investor-owned hospitals, so for-profit ventures have not been as significant an issue. Connecticut and New Jersey also have certificate-of-need laws.
Doctors claim that the hospitals are abusing their power when they revoke privileges, arguing that their care could suffer if patients are forced to choose between their doctor and the hospital best suited to treat them.
"This is economic credentialing, and it is despicable," said Dr. Richard F. Corlin, a gastroenterologist in Santa Monica, Calif., who is a trustee of the American Medical Association. The doctor-owned facilities provide the same quality care as general hospitals, but at lower costs, he added.
Mark E. Rust, a Chicago lawyer who works closely with physicians, says that hospitals may be violating antikickback laws if they tie hospital privileges to a doctor's pattern of referrals. 
Mr. Rust is representing about 20 doctors in Sharon, Pa., a town 64 miles east of Cleveland, who are weighing their legal options following a threat last month by Sharon Regional Health System to deny privileges to doctors, some of whom may be considering investing in a proposed surgical center. 
Hospitals, though, believe that they are well within their legal rights in denying privileges to doctors deemed as competitors. They note that a South Dakota surgeon lost a case last year against a hospital in Aberdeen that barred him for economic, not medical, reasons.
"You are going to see more instances of restricting staff privileges," said Thomas Campbell, a Chicago lawyer who has represented the hospital. 
Still, not every hospital wants to go to war with its physicians -- who, after all, drive many patients' choice of hospitals. Some are ignoring the competition. Some are investing, along with the doctors, in the new ventures, hoping to minimize the loss of revenues. Elsewhere, hospital executives figure that they have little choice but to go along with the doctors.
"We don't want to do anything to alienate them," said Jeffrey L. Susi, the chief executive of Indian River Memorial Hospital in Vero Beach, Fla. Indian River plans to bar its radiologists, who are not a source of referrals, from investing in competing facilities.
Doctors say that existing regulations, as well as the watchful eye of insurers and the government, will prevent any abuses by physicians. In Columbus, for example, doctors investing in the new orthopedic hospital insist that they have no intention of sending only the most profitable patients to their own facility. 
"We have made it very clear that we will accept any patient that we are medically qualified to take," Dr. Berasi said.
But hospitals have reason to worry that doctors will act in their own financial interest in choosing where to send patients, according to William J. Lynk, a senior economist at Lexecon, a Chicago consulting firm. In a recent issue of Health Affairs, a scholarly journal, he looked at two cases in which doctors who invested in outpatient surgical centers referred many of their patients to the centers. 
A similar experience in Sioux Falls, S.D., spurred Sioux Valley Hospitals and Health System to fight back aggressively. Patient counts dropped sharply when a group of cardiologists invested in a new heart hospital that opened last year. So Sioux Valley countered by organizing a competing cardiology practice that has managed to stabilize admissions.
Animosity is running high, according to Kelby Krabbenhoft, the hospital network's chief executive. "I've never seen an issue more polarizing," he said. But the hospital concluded that the doctors left it with no alternatives.
"We will never have a shotgun put to our head with our cardiologists again," Mr. Krabbenhoft said.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
A Lack of Money ForcesComputer Initiative to Close

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
When Stephen M. Case, then the chairman of America Online, and many other high-technology executives announced an initiative called PowerUP less than three years ago, they said that their donated millions would help bridge the "digital divide" between rich and poor.
 "We must take steps now so that in the Internet century, no children are left behind," Mr. Case said. 
 But tomorrow, with nearly 1,000 community-based technology centers financed across the country, the national offices of PowerUp will close and the centers will be left to fend for -- and finance -- themselves. 
Other groups, including the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, will keep many of the centers open with local financing, and many other initiatives to bridge the gap between the techno-haves and have-nots survive. Those familiar with the fizzle of the once-promising project say it is a disheartening side effect of the stock market slump.
A spokeswoman for PowerUP, Denise Keyes, said, "It was never the intention for this to go on" indefinitely, and that the centers were always supposed to become self-sustaining. "This seems like a natural transition time," she said.
Over the life of the organization, total corporate and foundation donations were estimated to be as much as $100 million, said Jerry Dovalis, executive vice president of Mr. Case's Case Foundation.
Mr. Case had taken a prominent role in introducing the initiative, providing $10 million in start-up money. 
"We recognize that there are many projects under way in communities across the nation that seek to bridge the digital divide," Mr. Case said in November 1999, "but they are fragmented and lack the scale necessary to attract significant resources. PowerUP will help knit these initiatives into a national tapestry and jump-start a crusade that can change the lives of millions of kids, bringing together an unprecedented combination of people, skills and resources."
That tapestry included the Case Foundation; the Waitt Family Foundation, started by the founder of Gateway computer, Ted Waitt; the AOL Foundation; the Corporation for National Service; the National Urban League; and America's Promise, the group founded by Colin L. Powell. 
Corporate sponsors climbed on the bandwagon, as well: not just technology companies like Microsoft, Cisco System, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems, but also PowerBar Inc., which pledged to provide its snack bars to the centers.
Mr. Dovalis hailed the start of 957 technology centers by PowerUP as "historic." He said, however, that the organization was a creature of its times -- the high-flying days when dot-com parking lots were chockful of Boxsters and portfolios were flush. 
"The model that was launched in late 1999 and began taking flesh and form in January of 2000 was a model that had its bloodlines in different economic times," he said. "The model isn't necessarily the best one for these economic times."
Some experts in bringing technology tools to the poor said that there were problems from the start. Larry Irving, a former Clinton administration official who was a prominent strategist in digital divide efforts, called PowerUP a "McDonald's-style, top-down franchise operation," which he said is not the best method for community development.
"I've been in this area for about 10 years -- the one thing we've learned is local efforts work best," he said.
Ultimately, the tapestry unraveled. "It's a partnership," said one executive involved with PowerUP. "It was never supposed to be one person at the banquet table saying month after month 'Here's the check.' "
Many groups are still providing technology services to the poor and disadvantaged, with programs financed by AOL Time Warner, Intel, Microsoft, Gateway and others, and by groups such as CTCnet, a grassroots national network of community technology centers. 
To Mr. Irving, "there's still a need out there" for such programs.
Although they are scrambling for backing, those who maintain the PowerUP sites say they are grateful. 
"It was an absolute blessing for us," said Robbie Callaway, the senior vice president of Boys and Girls Clubs of America, which runs 434 PowerUp sites within its clubs.
At the Cowan Community Center in Whitesburg, Ky., the coordinator, Stacy Dollarhyde, said of the 10-computer site that PowerUP built for them, "There's going to be challenges, definitely, to keep it up and running." 
But Ms. Dollarhyde, whose building had an electrical fire yesterday that forced her to send the HeadStart students home while things aired out, said adversity is not a stranger.
"We're in Appalachia," she said. "You kind of have to take what you get and be thankful for it, and build on that."

A Quaint State Where Rivals Really Debate

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: FARMINGTON, Conn. 

 BODY:
THERE is a big election in Connecticut next week just as in New York and New Jersey -- and you will never guess what the two major candidates for governor did on Monday afternoon. They had a debate. In fact, they have had four of them. Questions. Answers. Rebuttals. Amazing.
 If you have followed New York's race for governor or the United States Senate race in New Jersey -- two debate-challenged ordeals -- it was worth the gasoline money to drive here and see politicians who want the public's trust standing together discussing issues. Compared with the silliness in neighboring states, it was as quaint as a New England town square. 
This is not how real politicians conduct themselves.
Take New York. They held a debate in New York on Sunday, but, of course, Governor Pataki didn't show up. Why should he? He's the front-runner. Everyone knows front-runners debate as little as possible. It's only logical. If you are most likely to be elected, why waste time discussing issues? Discussing issues is something favored by people who don't get elected. Why do you think they don't get elected?
Mr. Pataki participated in two debates that included the most minor of candidates, ensuring that the voices of his strongest opponents were muted. When Mr. Pataki declined Sunday's debate, someone showed up dressed as a chicken to mock him.
That was the first sign that the Connecticut debate was quirky. No big chicken.
There was a sit-down lunch in a faux Colonial reception hall before the debate. On the table where the audience received name tags was a dish of peppermint candies, just so no one left with a bad taste in his or her mouth. The moderator instructed supporters to "sit on your hands" during the debate. Sure enough, there was not a peep until the end when everyone clapped with the appreciation that might be shown someone who gives a slide show at the public library on his recent vacation in Borneo.
The debate was not as much fun as a man dressed as a chicken, but it was helpful if you are trying to choose between the Republican governor, John Rowland, and the Democrat, Bill Curry, the former state comptroller.
It's not an insignificant choice. Connecticut has the highest per-capita income in the nation, but a budget shortfall necessitating deep cuts and possibly tax increases.
THE debate showed true contrasts. Mr. Curry, a large, loquacious policy hound, has plans that he says will fix the budget, cut prescription drug costs and reduce property taxes. He called the governor's proposals "a shell game with no pea." He seems so frustrated with voters' apparent tolerance of what he sees as scandals that you half expect him to set his hair on fire to get some attention.
Mr. Rowland, by contrast, said exactly what people surely utter when pulling into their driveways in Westport each evening: "I am proud to live in this state. We are indeed blessed."
He is a man satisfied with his two terms during the economic boom, but uncertain about the future. "We're facing some tough economic times," he said. Asked about solving the budget crisis, he said "everything is on the table" so often that it began to sound like exploratory surgery.
But at least he showed up to debate. As a clear front-runner, he had to be coaxed into four debates, but he did them. "People should be able to hear the candidates and the positions they have," Mr. Rowland said, explaining his strange behavior.
Suffice it to say, he would never make it in New Jersey. 
Former Senator Frank Lautenberg, the Rosie Ruiz of the New Jersey race, agreed to just two debates. The first one is tonight, with only a half-hour of one-on-one with Doug Forrester, the Republican, carried on a cable channel that reaches about half the state and on C-Span.
Since Democrats shoehorned in Mr. Lautenberg to replace the ethics-scarred Robert Torricelli, Mr. Lautenberg has declined numerous chances to debate, even while vowing to debate Mr. Forrester "anytime, anyplace." This agile obfuscation seems to settle the question of whether Mr. Lautenberg, at age 78, has lost a step or two.
But is Connecticut really an obfuscation-free zone? The truth is, the race here is lopsided with Mr. Rowland rolling in campaign dough, so perhaps giving his opponent a forum was a bit of incumbence oblige. 
Grilled after the debate on why he bothered to endure this exercise not once but four times, Governor Rowland insisted: "I'm a very fair person."
Rebuttal, Mr. Curry?

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
Nikon and Fallon End Relationship

BYLINE:  By Patricia Winters Lauro 

 BODY:
For the second time in less than a month, a longtime client is unexpectedly parting ways with Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis.
 Yesterday, it was Nikon Inc. in Melville, N.Y., the United States operations of the Japanese company Nikon, announcing that it would end a relationship with Fallon. 
 After working together eight years, "the time was right to explore new creative options in our advertising activities," Nikon said in a statement.
That reason was similar to the one given on Sept. 30 by the Timex Corporation when that company ended its 16-year relationship with Fallon and placed its account in review.
Nikon said it hoped to select a consultant in the next 30 days to help in the review for an agency to replace Fallon, which is part of the Publicis Groupe.
Fallon defeated three other finalists in a review for the Nikon account in May 1994, when billings were estimated at $10 million.
In 2001, Nikon spent $18.2 million on advertising in major media, according to CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres, compared with $11.7 million in 2000.
For the first six months of 2002, spending totaled $10.4 million, CMR reported, compared with $4.4 million in the period a year earlier.
Fallon had no comment beyond a statement in the Nikon release that it was "proud" to have worked for Nikon and wished the company "every success in the future."

HEADLINE: Pataki's Record: 2 Terms, Unexpected Turns 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
George E. Pataki ran for governor in 1994 promising tax cuts, tougher criminal penalties, welfare reform and not much else. It was a conservative platform well suited to the year of the Gingrich revolution and it worked, as Mr. Pataki unseated Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
 Times have changed, and so, it seems, has Mr. Pataki. His signature issues lost their political bite in an era of economic expansion, falling crime and plummeting welfare rolls. 
 Now, Mr. Pataki is seeking a third term on a platform of increased spending on schools and medical care, as a friend to the labor unions that once vilified him, and as the governor who has delivered gun controls, penalties for hate crimes and, prospectively, an equal-rights law for gay people, which the Senate has promised to pass in December. 
In short, the governor is running in the Nov. 5 election as a liberal, although he would never use the word to describe himself. Critics on the right, like Tom Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, say Mr. Pataki has become a counterfeit conservative. Critics on the left, including the Democratic challenger, H. Carl McCall, call him a counterfeit liberal.
"He defies easy labeling as right, center or left," said Gerald Benjamin, a political scientist at the State University of New York at New Paltz, who is a Republican and a former Ulster County legislator. "He's pragmatic, he's opportunistic and he's very shrewd, politically."
A review of Mr. Pataki's record reveals the paradox. He has lowered taxes but increased spending, increased aid to schools but challenged a court-ordered restructuring of school finance formulas, increased the open land under state protection but fallen short of his own goals on greenhouse gases. There are more jobs under his watch, but upstate New York is hurting economically. He has expanded access to health care, particularly for low-income families, but the mentally ill languish in adult homes and nursing homes.
The governor's own words complicate the task of assessing his record. He declined to be interviewed for this article. But on many issues, he has set out on a fairly conservative course, then taken a turn to the left. Democrats complain that he has a habit of joining the parade midway through the march, then claiming to lead it.
Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's communications director, said the governor had been consistent. "There are basic principles that he believes in: tax cuts, controlling spending, reducing welfare, a tough approach on crime," Mr. McKeon said. "He has always been a social moderate. He's pro-choice, he opposes discrimination in any form, and he's stood up against anti-immigrant policies."
What are often taken as changes in the governor's outlook are a product of changing times, Mr. McKeon said. "We inherited a $5 billion deficit, and then later there were record surpluses," he said. "The governor has worked hard to control the Legislature's impulse to spend more than we can afford. But the governor has always been eager, when the resources have become available, to put them into providing good services."
Still, much of Mr. Pataki's record begs the question: Should he be judged on what he proposed, or what he later agreed to? How many of his original stances are merely bargaining positions, as administration officials say, taken to hold back the Legislature's excesses?
With those questions in mind, here is a review of Mr. Pataki's eight-year record in some major areas.

Taxes and Spending
 Tax cuts were the central promise of Mr. Pataki's 1994 campaign and the signal achievement of his first term. The governor maintains that he has cut 19 different taxes 63 times, reducing taxes more than any other state.
His opponents complain that New York's state and local taxes are the highest in the nation and that property taxes are rising fast.
Both sides are right.
"We've dropped from No. 1 in the nation, all the way down to No. 1 in the nation," said Brian Backstrom, president of Change New York, a conservative group.
Lawmakers have eliminated the income tax on suburbanites who work in New York City, the tax on utility bills and the state sales tax on most clothing, among others. But the biggest state tax, the one Mr. Pataki cut most deeply, is the personal income tax. New Yorkers are paying 21 percent less than they would be paying if the law had been left as it was in 1994, a savings of more than $5 billion a year.
But by another measure, known as the effective tax rate, income taxes have declined far less. In 1994, New Yorkers paid 4.95 percent of their incomes in state income tax. In 2001, it was 4.7 percent, because the prosperity of the intervening years greatly increased the share of income taxed at the highest rates.
The income tax cuts also made the system more progressive -- that is, the lower the income, the greater the savings, proportionally. That was true of Mr. Pataki's original 1995 plan, and the Legislature pushed it further in that direction.
"If you look at the whole array of tax cuts, they've been very significant, and they've been distributed in a way that benefits every taxpayer," said Carole E. Stone, Mr. Pataki's budget director.
"There was a conscious decision made not to open the governor to the charge of doing a tax cut that favored the rich," said Edmund J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, who, as a Pataki aide, helped plan the 1995 cuts.
The second-biggest Pataki tax cut was the Star program, under which the state helps pay the property tax bills school districts charge to homeowners, saving them $2.8 billion a year. But conservative critics say Star has masked fast-rising school taxes.
"School districts have probably taken back something in the range of one-third of the total value of Star, by raising taxes faster than they otherwise would have," said Robert B. Ward, director of research at the Business Council of New York State.
Critics, liberal and conservative, argue that Star was less a tax cut than a popular way to redistribute money, particularly to suburban school districts. Frank Mauro of the liberal Fiscal Policy Institute also argues that renters got none of the benefit.
Ms. Stone said such criticism is unfair. "Looking back, it's hard to know, would taxes have behaved differently had Star not occurred," she said. "The fact is, the homeowners got a real benefit, and that many seniors now are not paying school property taxes."
Despite the cuts, state tax collections have risen under Mr. Pataki, driven mostly by rising incomes and spending, though not as fast as they did nationally. People and businesses are expected to pay $43 billion in New York State taxes and fees this fiscal year, an inflation-adjusted increase of 9 percent since the governor took office, compared with a national average of about 20 percent.
Local taxes also rose during the same period. According to a 1999 Census Bureau study, New York and Connecticut were roughly tied for the nation's highest combined state and local taxes.
The administration says that if it were not for Mr. Pataki's tax cuts, state taxes would be almost $14 billion a year higher, a figure that independent analysts call exaggerated. Mr. McMahon puts the net savings at $9.5 billion a year.
As for spending, as Mr. Golisano often notes, New York State's budget is $90 billion, up from $62 billion when Mr. Pataki took office. That is a 21 percent increase after inflation, somewhat below the national average, mostly to cover increases in Medicaid and education. 
Mr. Pataki was the first governor in memory to save a significant amount for a rainy day, but most of that surplus was used on large spending increases in the last two budgets as the election approached, leaving a glum outlook for next year.
New York is the most deeply indebted state; it has been for decades.

Health Care
 There is no clearer example of Mr. Pataki's beginning as a conservative, and then turning sharply to the left, than in health care.
In his first term he cut Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing homes, and reduced state regulation of hospitals. But he has since given money back to those same institutions in stages, culminating in a $1.8 billion deal struck in January.
What that leaves as Mr. Pataki's main health care legacy is a broad expansion of coverage for the uninsured -- the most significant increase in government-subsidized medical care to be found anywhere in the country, in a state that already ranked as the most generous.
New York's Children's Health Insurance Program covers more than 500,000 children, its Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Program helps more than 300,000 older people pay for prescription drugs and, after the Sept. 11 attack, the state enrolled 400,000 people in temporary "disaster relief Medicaid."
New programs to help low- and moderate-income adults get insurance have been slow to start, but they cover more than 100,000 people.
Robert Hinckley, deputy health commissioner, sees no contradiction in the Pataki record. "All of this is a natural outgrowth of the things he wanted to do, to make the system more efficient and provide better services to people," he said.
Mr. Pataki has disappointed business groups by agreeing to impose mandates on private insurance, like infertility treatment, which employers say will drive up costs for everyone.
But if Mr. Pataki has been generous to health care generally, he has not been for the mentally ill. He continued shrinking the state's mental hospitals to save money, but the discharged residents were far sicker than those released in the early years of deinstitutionalization. At the same time, he cut the state's investment in community-based treatment for the mentally ill.
As a result, thousands more mental patients are warehoused in adult homes and nursing homes, where they are often dangerously neglected, as documented in a series of articles this year by The New York Times.

Education
Year after year, Mr. Pataki proposed little or no increase in aid to schools and then, in negotiations with the Legislature, agreed to large increases. State aid for school operations rose from under $10 billion to more than $14 billion, and construction aid also climbed steeply.
An ambitious agreement with the Legislature, to pay for prekindergarten classes and other early-childhood programs, has stalled. Mr. Pataki at first lauded the effort, then tried to kill it to cut costs, postponing the final phases indefinitely.
Mr. Pataki has eliminated the longstanding practice of giving slightly less aid per student to New York City than the statewide average. Yet he vigorously contested a lawsuit that challenged financing for urban districts. When a Manhattan judge ruled against the state, issuing a scathing catalog of the New York City schools' inadequacies, Mr. Pataki appealed and won.
The appellate panel found that the state was not obliged to provide more than a middle-school education, a ruling the governor at first welcomed. Under political pressure, he recently disavowed the notion that an eighth-grade education was sufficient. The case is now headed for New York's highest court.
This year, Mr. Pataki and the Legislature gave the city a $400 million loan to raise teachers' salaries, winning him the teachers' union's endorsement. And after years of wrangling, state lawmakers agreed this year to something Mr. Pataki had long sought, mayoral control of New York City's schools.
How all this affects student performance is difficult to assess. Test scores have risen a bit, but some experts give more credit to the higher standards set by school officials and the State Board of Regents, over which the governor has no control.
Toward higher education, Mr. Pataki has been far less friendly. He raised tuition at public colleges sharply in 1995, and tried to raise it again in 1997. It remains, however, near the national average.
In his first year, Mr. Pataki also cut state aid to the colleges and tuition aid to low-income students. Adjusted for inflation, both are now about the same as in 1994. He tried to cut tuition aid several more times, but the Legislature refused.

The Environment
Mr. Pataki's oratory on environmental issues has exceeded his performance in all areas but conservation, partly because he has promised so much.
He announced that he would impose the nation's toughest restrictions on power plant emissions, a major source of smog, acid rain and greenhouse gases. Three years later, there are no regulations, and draft versions show that the cuts in emissions will not be quite as deep as Mr. Pataki had promised. 
He appointed a task force on greenhouse gases last year, directing it to come up with plans to make New York the national leader in combating global warming. After aiming for a June release date, the task force disagreed over a consultant's bold recommendations, and postponed its decisions until after the election.
While he has gotten a very resistant Metropolitan Transportation Authority to promise to convert 500 of its more than 3,000 buses from diesel to cleaner-burning natural gas, many of the nation's other urban transit agencies have done more.
"He's created this super-environmentalist image, always comparing himself to Teddy Roosevelt, but the truth just isn't on the same level," said Val Washington, executive director of the group Environmental Advocates.
One area where environmentalists are unanimous in praising the governor is wilderness preservation. He has struck deals with private landowners and conservation groups to keep hundreds of thousands of acres undeveloped.
"He's been a terrific governor in the sense of conservation," said John Adams, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "You couldn't ask for someone who has done more or cares more in terms of land protection, parks, wildlife."
To protect New York City's Catskills watershed, Mr. Pataki, over local opposition, struck a deal that environmentalists praised, though they now question its effectiveness.
And after years of refusing to take a position, last year he endorsed dredging the Hudson River to remove PCB's, helping persuade the Bush administration to order it done.
But he also reduced the number of environmental conservation workers monitoring compliance with the laws, and the department reduced fines against polluters. Critics argue he is easy on corporate polluters, but the administration contends it achieves more through cooperative action.
Cleanup of toxic waste sites has been a problem; the state's program ran out of money last year, and a dispute over renewing it is unresolved. Mr. Pataki wants to expand the program to include many more sites, but environmentalists and legislators are divided over his proposals to reduce the costs paid by industry and to ease cleanup standards in some cases.
"Nationally, he has to be considered among the top governors, maybe the top," said Mr. Adams, one of the environmentalists closest to Mr. Pataki.
Ms. Washington said: "The governor hasn't been bad, but there has been a series of hints that something great was about to happen, and then it doesn't."

Economic Development
Under Mr. Pataki, New York has gained 600,000 jobs, and in recent years has matched the national growth rate for the first time in decades.
Yet upstate New York's economy has continued to atrophy. While the New York City metropolitan region gained 1 million people from 1990 to 2000, Buffalo lost 35,000 people, Rochester 12,000 and Syracuse 17,000.
Much of the job growth of Mr. Pataki's tenure stemmed from a roaring stock market. Similarly, much of the state's current trouble can be traced to the weakening of that market, and to the World Trade Center attack. What a governor can do about all that is debatable.
Business groups say Governor Pataki has reduced the regulatory burden on businesses, eliminated hundreds of rules and won changes in the worker's compensation law that lowered employers' insurance premiums by more than 30 percent.
Mr. Pataki has also persuaded some large companies -- like I.B.M., which built a major computer chip plant in East Fishkill -- to remain in New York or to locate there, offering grants, loans and tax breaks. This year, a consortium of computer chip makers agreed to build a new research center in Albany.
But critics like Mr. Golisano say Mr. Pataki's economic policies have been too focused on giveaways to major corporations, while neglecting small businesses that are the core of the state's economy and job growth.
In the last three years, the governor has adopted a legislative plan to lure companies to blighted areas by declaring them Empire Zones and providing tax breaks, and he has promoted high-tech research, most notably by creating "Centers of Excellence" at state university campuses. He has also seized on gambling as a form of economic development, finally winning passage last year of a law allowing up to six Indian casinos and putting slot-type machines at race tracks. The effectiveness of all these measures remains to be seen.

Ethics and Reform
After the 1994 election, Mr. Pataki created two funds to pay for transition and inaugural expenses. Promising a new era of openness and rectitude, he said the funds would abide by campaign contribution limits and make their records public.
They did neither. The records were released three years later under an Assembly subpoena. They showed that corporations had given more than allowed under the campaign finance law, the funds had paid large bonuses to Pataki aides, and they raised three times as much as the Pataki camp had said.
No laws were broken, but the promise of a new day was.
"I don't know if the ethical lapses have been any better or worse than previous administrations," said Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group. "But the governor hasn't done anything to make it better, and there has been a troubling habit of secrecy."
Ethical questions have arisen about Mr. Pataki's practice of giving paid speeches (a practice he hid for almost a year); his 1995 and 1996 trips to Hungary, which were indirectly paid for by Philip Morris and other corporations with business before the state; and the millions of dollars raised by his campaigns from companies doing business with the state.
Mr. Golisano has reminded voters that a Pataki fund-raiser was accused of trying to trade paroles for campaign contributions. The fund-raiser was convicted of covering up his actions and three Parole Board officials were convicted of lying to investigators about the affair. A jury deadlocked on the pay-for-parole charge.
Several people close to the governor have made a great deal of money from their connections to him, and Democrats have frequently questioned the governor's habit of appointing political allies, friends and family members to government jobs.
Mr. McKeon said that Mr. Pataki had reduced the number of patronage appointments a governor makes. As for political connections of the appointees, lobbyists and contractors, he said: "There's always going to be cynics, and there's no controlling that. The people appointed by the governor have met the highest standards."
Questions have also been raised about the governor's wife, Libby, who earns $200,000 a year as a part-time consultant to several business interests, including Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics magnate, who is a major financial backer of Mr. Pataki's. 
On government reform, Mr. Pataki has advocated an initiative and referendum system, but did not push the Legislature on the issue until this year, as he sought the backing of Independence Party leaders. He has proposed new campaign finance restrictions and term limits, but has not worked hard to promote either. His campaign this year violates his own 1994 pledge to limit himself to two terms.
Mr. Pataki has opposed attempts by the lobbying commission, good-government groups and legislative leaders to to change a major loophole that allows lobbying for state contracts to go unreported.
In 1996 and 2000, Mr. Pataki worked to exclude insurgent Republican candidates from New York's presidential primary ballot, then said he regretted the effort. He lowered some of New York's notorious ballot access barriers after the 1996 primary, and tried again in 2000, but that effort has stalled.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: SEEKING HAVEN; 
Since Attacks, U.S. Admits Fewer Refugees

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
The number of refugees admitted to the United States declined sharply in the 2002 fiscal year because security concerns stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks bogged down the screening process, State Department officials say.
 The Bush administration has rejected calls from refugee advocates and a bipartisan group of lawmakers to make up for the shortfall in the federal refugee resettlement program, which officials concede marks the biggest drop in two decades. 
 The United States had allocated space and money for up to 70,000 refugees for the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1, 2001, but it admitted only 27,113, sacrificing 61 percent of the slots, the officials said. In the previous year, Washington took in 68,426 refugees. 
For this year, President Bush this month approved a ceiling of 70,000 refugees, but he designated only 50,000 slots for people from specific regions. He held the rest in reserve for contingencies that may or may not put them to use.
"It's very distressing and at the same time it's somewhat understandable," said Kenneth H. Bacon, president of Refugees International. While refugee advocates sympathized with the administration's need to protect against terrorist infiltrators, he said, "The system clearly didn't work this year."
A bipartisan group of 41 lawmakers, including the chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate subcommittee that handles refugees, wrote to the president last month asking for 100,000 slots for the new fiscal year.
"Tens of thousands of refugees have been stranded overseas in places of danger or squalid refugee camps, and have not been able to find a new secure future in the United States during this past year," the lawmakers said. "These unused spaces are in essence like unused lifeboats on a sinking ship."
By law, the president each year provides a limit on the number of refugees who may be resettled in the United States as well as a region-by-region breakdown. Slots that are not used in one year do not carry over into the next.
But the White House rebuffed the lawmakers, and State Department officials, who administer refugee resettlement in tandem with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said they are hamstrung by logistical difficulties.
After the Sept. 11 attacks, the resettlement program was halted for two months, as officials adopted new security measures, like running all applicants' names through intelligence and law enforcement data bases, fingerprinting applicants and setting up secure procedures for flying in the new arrivals.
The program was further hampered last year by an inability of I.N.S. workers to conduct on-site interviews in some countries because of security concerns. In a report to Congress this month, the State Department described problems slowing the processing of refugees, including "deteriorating security conditions in refugee camps, the inadequacy of medical facilities required to conduct thorough medical screenings, and concern about integrity, including fraud and corruption."
State Department officials said they are addressing the problems by hiring more screeners, cracking down on fraud and expanding the number of interview sites at a cost of nearly $20 million.
"Our No. 1 goal, obviously, is to protect the American public, but at the same time, continue this generous program," said a department spokeswoman, who asked not to be named. "We are confident that the steps we've taken to address the processing complexities have laid the groundwork for smoother processing in the future."
Refugee advocates question whether their clients should be processed through the same immigration and security procedures used for foreign businessmen and other travelers. The F.B.I. and the Central Intelligence Agency have been overwhelmed with background checks, delaying visas for months. But refugees, the advocates say, are already among the most closely vetted of immigrants, and many of them are in desperate circumstances.
To qualify for refugee status, an applicant must show "a well-founded fear of persecution" on the basis of race, religion, nationality or social or political affiliations.
Estimates of the number of refugees fluctuate between 12 million and 15 million. Among the most vulnerable populations are Burmese in Thailand, Sudanese Christians in Kenya, Sierra Leoneans and Liberians in Guinea, religious minorities in the former Soviet Union and Iraqis in Saudi Arabia, officials said.
The administration's allocation for 2003 would grant the greatest number of slots to Africans. It sets a ceiling of 20,000 from Africa; 4,000 from East Asia; 2,500 from Eastern Europe; 14,000 from the former Soviet Union; 2,500 from Latin America and the Caribbean; 7,000 from the Middle East and South Asia. In addition, there are 20,000 contingency spaces. 
Some critics in Congress say such numbers are stingy. The United States is still the world leader in admitting refugees, but, despite relatively steady demand, the number of admissions has declined from a high point of 132,173 in 1992.
"A reduction in refugee admissions represents substantial human hardship, and it undermines the leadership role of the United States in the world community," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusets Democrat who chairs the subcommittee that oversees refugee resettlement.
Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican who is the subcommittee's ranking member, said the administration cannot expect other countries to take in refugees if the United States does not take a leadership role.
"I don't think we're providing the example to the world we should," Mr. Brownback said. "Look what we ask other countries to do. We ask Pakistan not to turn back Afghan refugees. We ask China not to send back North Korean refugees. We need to be willing to step forward as an example."
Refugee groups say that other nations that have a tradition of welcoming refugees are also beginning to cut back on their admissions. Australia, Canada and Western European nations are scaling back because of a combination of security jitters, lackluster economies and a public that is increasingly hostile to immigration, according to Joung-ah Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. 
The world "has become much less friendly toward accepting refugees," Ms. Ghedini said. "We need to remind ourselves that these people are fleeing incredibly horrific circumstances."

HEADLINE: 'Tweed Academy' Is Latest Courthouse Role 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg revealed plans yesterday for a "learning center" in the Tweed Courthouse, where students from around the city will come for classes with New York themes in government, literature, architecture, economics, art and history.
 The Tweed Academy -- named for William Marcy Tweed, the notorious 19th-century political boss -- will open this spring in the ground floor of the courthouse, which recently became the Department of Education headquarters. Evenings and weekends, the space will be used for teacher training and programs for the public, including a lecture series and adult literacy classes. 
 "The Tweed Academy will powerfully symbolize the high priority that the city government puts on education for all our students," Mr. Bloomberg said at Tweed, where the ground floor is still under renovation. "It will send the message that in New York City, academic excellence is available to all who seek it." 
Mr. Bloomberg was speaking somewhat metaphorically, as the chances of all 1.1 million city schoolchildren spending time in the opulent Tweed building are virtually nil. Elementary and middle school students will come for two-week "academic residencies," and the building can accommodate about 200 children per session, education officials said.
At that rate, about 3,600 students can visit each year, plus about 4,000 high school students who will come for after-school and weekend academic programs. 
Diana Lam, the deputy schools chancellor for teaching and learning, said that only third graders would visit Tweed Academy this spring, as the program gets off the ground. Third and seventh graders will come next fall, and other grades may eventually be added, she said. 
But while most students will never set foot in Tweed, Seymour Fliegel, a former deputy superintendent in East Harlem who is now president of the Center for Educational Innovation-Public Education Association, said the opportunity could prove valuable for those who get it.
"I assume that they will have some of the best teachers in the system working there," Mr. Fliegel said. "Say a kid is in a lousy class, in a really terrible school. If you spend two weeks down there, then at least you've got two weeks of what learning should really be about."
Ms. Lam and her aides are devising lesson plans, as well as a system for deciding which students come when.
"We have designed a school-day program that will focus on literacy and will use our rich landscape of New York City as its primary text," Ms. Lam said. "It will take over two years to ensure that every single school in the city of New York will have sent students here for some type of activity."
Ms. Lam said that lessons at Tweed Academy would be interdisciplinary, so that students might study mathematics, physics and architecture for a unit on the Brooklyn Bridge. She plans to bring in a staff of teachers to work at Tweed full time.
Mr. Bloomberg, who unveiled his plans a day after ordering a citywide hiring freeze and a new round of budget cuts, said it would cost $7.5 million to transform the ground floor of Tweed into classrooms and a cafeteria. That expense comes on top of a $100 million renovation of the entire building, most of which was carried out by the Giuliani administration.
Aides to Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein said that other expenses would include transporting students to Tweed each day, teacher salaries, meals and supplies. They did not provide a cost estimate.
Historic preservationists have complained about Mr. Bloomberg's decision to use Tweed as the school system headquarters, and hoped that city building codes would foil his plan to turn the ground floor into a school. But Mr. Bloomberg said that nothing done at Tweed Academy would threaten the building's historic details.
"Anybody who's seen what we've done with this building in terms of historic preservation should be thrilled," the mayor said yesterday.
The mayor rolled his eyes and cast a withering look at a reporter who asked about the possibility of schoolchildren vandalizing or otherwise damaging the Tweed building.
"I think that that's the responsibility of the principals, teachers, administrators, to make sure that a handful of bad apples don't destroy the beauty for everybody and don't take away the opportunity for everybody."
Henry Stern, the former parks commissioner and one of the most outspoken critics of Mr. Bloomberg's use of the Tweed building, had a new gripe yesterday: Why name the learning center after Boss Tweed, who was known more for corruption than for intellectual rigor?
"To name an educational facility for children to honor the greatest thief in 350 years of city government is a decision which exalts celebrity over integrity," Mr. Stern said in a statement he sent to reporters. "I urge that it be reconsidered."

HEADLINE: As U.S. Seeks a Trade Accord, Brazilians Recall Discord 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
For a hint of the trouble lying ahead this week for the United States proposals for a free-trade pact with Latin America, consider Luiz Fernando Furlan's chicken problems.
 Mr. Furlan is chief executive of Sadia, a food-processing company based here that exports about $700 million worth of poultry, beef and pork products each year to European Union nations, the Middle East and parts of Asia. 
 Sadia sells nothing at all to the United States, mainly because the company's health and technical procedures do not precisely match American requirements. 
"Instead of holding out carrots, they are beating us with sticks," said Mr. Furlan, noting that Europe's finicky regulators have raised none of the obstacles imposed by the United States. "It's a form of protectionism."
This week in Ecuador, top trade negotiators from the United States will sit down with trade ministers from around the Western Hemisphere to develop a blueprint for negotiating a free-trade zone from Canada all the way to the southern tip of Argentina.
The goal is to complete a "Free Trade Agreement for the Americas" by January 2005. It would be an ambitious expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994, not only eliminating tariffs and quotas but also establishing common principles for regulating investment, labor practices and the environment.
But here in Brazil, home to 175 million people and Latin America's biggest economy, a large swath of business and political leaders are disillusioned and suspicious about their giant trading partner to the north.
President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who won a landslide election victory on Sunday, has warned that a free-trade deal would be "tantamout to an annexation of Brazil by the United States." 
Mr. da Silva added to American annoyance by insisting at least twice that any agreement should include America's bete noire, Cuba.
Brazil is crucial to any free-trade agreement for the Americas. It accounts for 40 percent of South America's total economy. It is an American-scale competitor in global agriculture, with farms that are huge and highly mechanized. 
It is also a growing industrial power: its largest export is no longer coffee but small and medium-sized airplanes, produced by Embraer. It has been a huge magnet for direct foreign investment, drawing in more than $160 billion over the last five years.
But Mr. da Silva and his left-wing Workers' Party are hardly the only opponents here to a pan-American, free-trade zone. Many industrial manufacturers, still shielded behind Brazil's own import barriers, see themselves as net losers. Even those who salivate over huge new export opportunities -- sugar growers, soybean farmers, textile producers -- are skeptical. A free-trade pact would eliminate the steep American tariffs of more than 300 percent on tobacco and sugar and more than 100 percent on orange juice.
Yet, farmers here are still seething about the farm bill that the United States Congress passed this spring, which authorized more than $100 billion in subsidies for cash crops, including cotton, soybeans and sugar.
Cotton farmers say the cotton subsidies sent world prices plunging and wiped out most of their profits this year. Brazil's soybean farmers, who are second only to the United States in production, say they would have suffered an even worse fate had it not been for bad weather conditions and low output in the United States. 
Food processors like Mr. Furlan are angry about what they consider backdoor protectionism through technical restrictions. Steel producers are furious about "anti-dumping" penalties on their products. 
"Except for airplanes, all the other big export products face high barriers when you go to the United States," said Gilberto Dupas, director of the Institute for the Study of International Economics in Sao Paulo. 
As Mr. da Silva's victory on Sunday made clear, Brazil is experiencing at least a partial backlash against both globalization and American prescriptions for prosperity.
Many Brazilians blame their problems at least in part on the country's embrace of the "Washington consensus" for economic development -- privatizing state-owned companies, opening markets to more competition, attracting foreign investment and doing everything possible to tame inflation.
Thanks largely to the global economic slowdown, Brazilian growth has slowed to a crawl. Interest rates, among the highest in the world, begin at 21 percent.
The financial turmoil in Argentina has not helped matters. Argentina's financial collapse this year choked off one of Brazil's biggest trading partners. It also rattled foreign banks and investors, who feared that Brazil might slide down a similar path.
"Globalization doesn't have the same good meaning here that it did before," said Kjeld Jakobsen, director of international affairs at the Confederation of Labor Unions, Brazil's largest federation of unions.
Despite the growing opposition to globalization, Brazilians remain deeply divided on free trade. Agricultural and textile exporters, who enjoy much lower costs than many American rivals, have everything to gain if the United States lowers its steep farm barriers. Many industrial companies, though, remain shielded by Brazilian import tariffs that run as high as 35 percent. 
"There are really two negotiations that have to take place," said Celso Lafer, Brazil's departing foreign minister. "One is the negotiation with other countries. But the first negotiation has to be within the country itself, and there has been no internal negotiation of this type yet in Brazil."
But almost everybody here agrees that Brazil should not accept any deal that does not include deep reductions in American agricultural barriers. Yet, that is precisely the area in which Brazilian experts are most suspicious.
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, has proposed an ambitious plan that calls for huge reductions in agricultural tariffs and subsidies around the world. 
But Congress, in passing legislation that gives the administration enhanced authority to negotiate trade deals, pointedly insisted that Mr. Zoellick or his successor "consult" with Congress on a long list of "sensitive" agricultural products like sugar, cotton, orange juice and textiles. 
"The signals are not good," said Marcos Jank, a former trade advisor to the Inter-American Development Bank and now a professor of economics at the University of Sao Paulo. "The sectors where Brazil is most competitive are the ones that are most protected in the United States."
Mr. da Silva's landslide victory on Sunday is likely to harden resistance even further here.
Dorthea Werneck, director of Brazil's export promotion agency and an advocate of a trade deal, said the economic downturn has put all countries on the defensive and made trade talks even more difficult than usual.
Big Brazilian exporters like Sadia, which exports thousands of tons of frozen chicken and meat to more than 70 countries, maintain that they have almost everything to gain and nothing to lose from a deal.
But even Mr. Furlan, Sadia's chief executive, often despairs of breaking through American intransigence.
"It is as if the wealthiest person in the neighborhood was inviting everybody to a big party," Mr. Furlan remarked. "But instead of sending out nice invitations, he tells you that you will have to buy tickets to get in and that you will have to pay a very high price."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR NORTH KOREA; 
Pyongyang Rejects Demands to End Atom Bomb Program

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
North Korea today flatly rejected international demands that it abandon its nuclear weapons program. The statement came at the opening session of talks with Japan aimed at establishing normal relations between the two countries.
 The rejection, reflected in opening remarks and repeated during the first day of talks, followed consultations in Mexico that ended two days ago, in which the United States, South Korea and Japan urged the North to end its bomb program. 
 "Japan expressed grave concern on nuclear issues, and we also referred to the statement issued last week by Japan, the United States and South Korea," a Japanese official here said. "To put it in one sentence, North Korea's response was they do not accept it at all." 
Even before talks opened here this morning, a North Korean diplomat, Jong Thae Hwa, signaled his delegation's unwillingness to discuss security issues, saying, "We have come with no such preparations." 
In a brief exchange of greetings, Mr. Jong set the tone for difficult talks, adding, "Although we gathered here for talks on normalizing ties, certainly, we are far apart."
In a statement issued in Mexico, the United States, South Korea and Japan warned that "North Korea's relations with the international community now rest on North Korea's prompt and visible actions to dismantle its program to produce highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons."
Japanese diplomats said Mr. Jong blamed Washington's "hostile stance toward North Korea" for the region's security problems.
The heightened interest in security issues comes after the North's surprise admission during talks with the United States last month that it has been developing nuclear arms in secret, through uranium enrichment.
The admission came after the United States confronted North Korea with intelligence revealing the weapons program, which violates a 1994 agreement.
The United States has since urged Japan and South Korea, as well as China, to help it apply "maximum pressure" to force North Korea to halt the program. So far, none of those countries has shown the commitment that the Bush administration has sought on the issue.
Indeed, South Korea, which under President Kim Dae Jung has become a major supplier of aid to North Korea, has in recent days cast doubt on American characterizations of Washington's recent conversations with North Korea.
In secret discussions with the North that began more than a year ago, Japan has reportedly offered a huge amount of economic aid in exchange for normal diplomatic ties. 
In the last week, though, senior Japanese officials have said normalization talks can bear fruit only if the North satisfies international concerns about nuclear weapons. Regional political analysts say that message has been substantially muddied by the issue of abductions by North Korea.
During a meeting between Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, last month, North Korea acknowledged the kidnapping of 13 Japanese, beginning in the late 1970's, for use in the country's spy training program.
The 5 of the 13 who survive were allowed to visit Japan this month, and Tokyo extended their stay indefinitely. The visit has caused a groundswell of emotion over the stories of separated families and hardship and, significantly, fanned criticism of Mr. Koizumi's diplomacy.
On Sunday, for example, Japan's largest business daily, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, reported that the United States had informed Mr. Koizumi of North Korea's secret uranium enrichment program three weeks before his trip to Pyongyang.
The newspaper said the Bush administration, frustrated that its information had not deterred Japan from moving ahead with normalization talks, took the unusual step of contacting former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, a rival within Mr. Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party, to warn of the dangers of proceeding.
But Mr. Koizumi went ahead and signed a memorandum of understanding in which North Korea said it would abide by all international agreements on nuclear arms.
"The information from the United States was just that there is strong suspicion, so we didn't take it so seriously," the newspaper quoted a senior aide to Mr. Koizumi as saying.
Japanese officials have made it clear that the abduction issue is the most important topic in their talks with North Korea, though they do not seem to be making progress in winning the release of the abductees' families.
"The North Koreans are playing remarkably well from a pretty week hand," said Robyn Lim, an expert in East Asian politics at Nanzan University in Nagoya, Japan. "South Korean officials are already publicly disputing Bush administration accounts of discussions with Pyongyang, and the wedge between Washington and Japan looks like it is growing too."

HEADLINE: Brazil's Next President 

 BODY:
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva became the first leftist ever elected president of Brazil when he won last Sunday's runoff by a wide margin. Since Brazil was governed by a military dictatorship only two decades ago and Mr. da Silva was once an imprisoned dissident, his election is a tribute to the triumphant consolidation of democracy in South America's largest nation.
 Pressing financial concerns threaten to overshadow this historical watershed, however. The president-elect, who will assume office in January, is working hard to reassure foreign investors and financial markets that he is not a reckless Marxist firebrand. 
 Despite Mr. da Silva's relatively moderate tone in his fourth run for the presidency, investors feared the former union leader might repudiate Brazil's foreign debt or seek to reverse President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic liberalization. Already this year, the real, Brazil's currency, has lost 30 percent of its value, largely on worries of a da Silva presidency. With the bulk of the nation's public debt pegged to the dollar, reversing the slide is imperative. Otherwise, Brazil could face a painful default along the lines of Argentina, but with more devastating consequences for the global economy. 
Mr. da Silva, who will walk a tightrope in seeking to satisfy pent-up demand for social spending at a time of austerity, has softened his old views and pledged to abide by his country's obligations.
Foreign investors and financial institutions must provide the new government with some breathing room and be understanding of Mr. da Silva's political balancing act. It is in everyone's interest for Brazil not just to grow, but to grow into a more just society. 
As for the Bush administration, Mr. da Silva's triumph represents a unique opportunity at a time when Latin Americans have been feeling justifiably neglected by Washington. President Bush must engage Brazil in warm, respectful talks on a hemispheric trade agreement, and be more sympathetic to that nation's financial plight. Such a posture could help disappoint those who hope that a resurgence of the left in South America will be accompanied by a resurgent anti-Americanism.

HEADLINE: Medical Marijuana Wins a Court Victory 

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK 

 BODY:
A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled yesterday that the federal government may not revoke the licenses of doctors who recommend marijuana to their patients.
 The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is the biggest legal victory yet for voter initiatives in nine states that legalized marijuana for medical purposes. It upholds a five-year-old lower-court decision that blocked the government's efforts to frustrate a 1996 initiative in California. 
 There was no immediate word if the government would appeal yesterday's ruling. Spokesmen for the Justice Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration said only that the government was reviewing the decision. 
In prohibiting the government from enforcing the policy, the appeals court, one of the most liberal in the nation, entered a complex and heated debate at the intersection of medical science, the First Amendment rights of doctors and patients, and federal power over the states.
"This is one of those big culture-war decisions," said Graham A. Boyd, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represented the plaintiffs.
The judges accepted every major argument offered by the plaintiffs, who are California doctors and patients with serious illnesses. 
The California law, Proposition 215, allows patients to grow and possess marijuana so long as they have a doctor's written or oral recommendation. It says doctors may not be punished for making such a recommendation. 
Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon and Washington have similar laws; all but Maine and Colorado are in the Ninth Circuit. Rather than focusing on doctors, federal efforts to override state medical marijuana initiatives have generally taken the form of raids on marijuana clubs and collectives, mostly in California. 
Yesterday's decision, written by Chief Judge Mary M. Schroeder, held that the policy effectively prohibited candid discussions between doctors and patients, in violation of the First Amendment. 
"Physicians must be able to speak frankly and openly to patients," the court said.
Quoting Justice John Paul Stevens of the Supreme Court, Judge Schroeder added that federal courts should defer to the states in "situations in which the citizens of a state have chosen to serve as a laboratory in the trial of novel social and economic experiments."
Judge Schroeder was joined by Judge Betty B. Fletcher, who like her was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, and by Judge Alex Kozinski, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan.
Mr. Boyd of the A.C.L.U. said that because patients in California and elsewhere may use medical marijuana only with a doctor's recommendation, the federal policy could have frustrated all medical marijuana initiatives.
"This is really the central issue in medical marijuana," he said.
The appeals court held that a recommendation is not a prescription. A doctor actually prescribing marijuana, the panel said, "would be guilty of aiding and abetting in violation of federal law."
Dispensing information rather than drugs, the court held, is protected by the First Amendment. The court rejected the government's argument that "a doctor's 'recommendation' of marijuana may encourage illegal conduct by the patient." It called the link between the prohibited speech and criminal conduct "too attenuated."
Vikram Amar, a law professor at Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, said that aspects of yesterday's decision were too sweeping.
"The big flaw in the majority's First Amendment argument," he said, "is that it doesn't acknowledge that the government has traditionally been allowed to regulate the professions without violating the First Amendment."
Professor Amar also criticized another aspect of the decision, which forbade the government to investigate doctors on the basis of their recommendations.
"The idea that you can't initiate an investigation based on an invocation of the First Amendment is bizarre," he said. 
Judge Kozinski, in a concurring opinion, said that doctors would have had much to lose and little to gain by violating the government's policy.
"They may destroy their careers and lose their livelihoods," he wrote. "Only the most foolish or committed of doctors will defy the federal government's policy and continue to give patients candid advice about the medical uses of marijuana." 
Judge Kozinski described what he called "a legitimate and growing division of informed opinion" on the medical usefulness of marijuana.
He cited reports by the National Academy of Sciences, the Canadian government and the British House of Lords ("a body not known for its wild and crazy views," the judge noted) concluding that marijuana has at least potential medical uses in controlling pain and nausea and in stimulating the appetite.
Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, said the decision took issue with a particularly intrusive form of federal interference with state law.
"They are really making it impossible for the state to implement its own regulatory scheme," he said of the federal government's policy.
Keith Vines, an assistant district attorney in San Francisco, is one of the plaintiffs. In 1993, he developed wasting syndrome, a little understood metabolic change associated with H.I.V. infection that caused his weight to drop from 195 pounds to 145 pounds. "I was a patient facing death desperately looking for an option," he said.
After Proposition 215 passed in 1996, Mr. Vines discussed marijuana with his doctor. She recommended it, and he found it helped his appetite.
"It was a miracle," he said. "My weight came back."
Mr. Vines, who prosecuted one of the largest marijuana cases in California history and says he opposes recreational use of the drug, was pleased by yesterday's decision.
"The decision today is of really great practical importance," he said. "The federal government has no business telling doctors what they can and can't say."

HEADLINE: Frank Lautenberg for U.S. Senate 

 BODY:
The Senate race in New Jersey is a very different kind of contest than voters were anticipating a few weeks ago. With Senator Robert Torricelli out of the race, the contest no longer revolves around the question of how much of Mr. Torricelli's unappetizing ethics the state can stomach. Since Frank Lautenberg stepped in as the Democratic nominee, the voters have had the luxury of focusing on the actual issues. 
 New Jersey is well acquainted with Mr. Lautenberg, who announced his retirement as the state's senior senator in 2000, citing his dislike of campaign fund-raising. His Republican opponent, Douglas Forrester, had been happily forging a political identity simply as the one who wasn't Bob Torricelli. But now he has been forced to define himself more fully. Mr. Forrester turns out to be an engaging and intelligent businessman, a moderately conservative Republican whose public record pales next to Mr. Lautenberg's. 
 At age 78, Mr. Lautenberg looks trim and vigorous, but he has already faced some backdoor sniping about his age from Mr. Forrester's aides. It was a problem Mr. Lautenberg could expect, since he made the same point when he first ran for the Senate against the 72-year-old Millicent Fenwick.
The former senator says that he realized soon after his retirement that he missed the real work of the Senate. We also missed his voice against tobacco -- he launched the ban on smoking in airplanes -- and for better gun control. New Jersey could use him in the Senate fighting for some of the issues most important to the state, including environmental protection and reviving Amtrak. Another of Mr. Lautenberg's major achievements was, ironically, his co-authorship of the Senate gift ban that was the centerpiece of the case against Mr. Torricelli.
Mr. Lautenberg has the stature and background to deal with the complex issues of war, national security, the economy and health care that the nation will be facing in the years to come. We endorse Frank Lautenberg for United States senator in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Rummy Runs Rampant 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld fired off a memo last week revoking the longstanding title "CINC," or "commander in chief," bestowed on Tommy Franks and the cadre of other four-star military chieftains who plan and fight American wars around the world.
 He's been on a rampage for months about top generals and admirals getting to call themselves commander in chief. 
 Himself, as Rummy is known behind his back at the Pentagon, is not being a total tyrant. He says the "combatant commanders," as he's rechristened the CINC's, can use whatever's left of their stationery with the old titles. The Pentagon may be spending trillions trying to chase off one Mideast megalomaniac, but they're watching their pennies preserving paper. 
The rambunctious Rummy has also banned the generic phrase "National Command Authority," instructing that people simply refer to him and the president specifically. He likes his authority monogrammed. 
Donald Rumsfeld has become redolent of Donald Regan, the forceful and brusque Reagan chief of staff who had trouble remembering who was president.
Mr. Regan built his own colonnaded version of the Rose Garden patio outside his office and kept his own Secret Service detail outside his door, eyeball-to-eyeball with President Reagan's Secret Service detail.
But he went too far when he tried to commandeer Marine One to visit the president in Bethesda Naval Hospital after Mr. Reagan underwent surgery; Nancy Reagan frostily informed him that the helicopter was a presidential form of travel.
The Pentagon chief has plenty of helicopters of his own. And you will never find the elegant and detached Laura Bush slapping back usurpers. So Rummy runs rampant.
First, he and his brainy advisers, Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle, set up their own State Department within the Defense Department, designing a more grandiose and aggressive foreign policy that can be summarized: "We're No. 1. We like it that way. And we're going to keep it that way."
Then they set up their own Defense Department within the Defense Department, staging a civilian coup and yanking back power from a military establishment they felt had grown too skittish about risking troops in combat.
And now Rummy and his inner circle have set up their own C.I.A. within the Defense Department. Disgusted that the C.I.A. dismisses their claims of a Saddam-Al Qaeda connection, the Pentagon hawks simply created their own intelligence unit to ferret out information that will justify their foreign policy and military goals. 
So we have one group of spies that doesn't get any information, and another group of spies looking for information that doesn't exist so they can twist it.
At least we know the hawks won't set up their own E.P.A. within the Pentagon, since Rummy is fighting in Congress to get the military exempted from a lot of environmental rules.
While the muscular Rummy power grabs pieces of other agencies, Karl Rove and W. obsess over how to emanate muscularity.
Ever since 9/11, when Republican elders worried that the president was being swallowed up by his chair, Mr. Bush has strained to imitate the two-fisted, broad-shouldered style of Ronald Reagan.
The strategy worked brilliantly to put Democrats on the defensive. Even though the Congressional leadership went along with the White House on the Iraq war, the Democrats have still been painted as the wimpy McGovernite party.
And now, with Walter Mondale and Jimmy Carter back at center stage, and with the Democrats beatifying the far-left Paul Wellstone as a way of holding on to the Senate, the ghosts of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.-E.R.A. are supposed to save the party?
The real Reagan made mincemeat of Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale, casting them as girly-boys who lacked the swagger necessary to lead the world.
The faux Reagan is doing well projecting the image of Protector in Chief. But has he really done the hard work to protect us from anything? Osama bin Laden is still at large. We don't know who sent the anthrax letters. Another Qaeda attack could be coming at any moment. The economy is imploding. The crime rate is rising.
The only really bad guys who have been caught since 9/11 are the snipers, who left a trail of clues leading to their car, where they were asleep.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
How Deep and How Often to Use the City Budget Knife

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The city was going broke. The rookie mayor ordered across-the-board cuts to city agencies. The agencies balked, saying they could do so only with draconian service reductions. So the mayor relented, and postponed many of the cutbacks he had sought.
 It was November 1974, the mayor was Abraham D. Beame, and New York City was on the brink of its worst fiscal calamity. While the city may well have been too far gone by then to avoid the crisis that brought it near bankruptcy, some fiscal watchdogs complained that Mayor Beame should have taken tougher steps sooner. 
 Now another new mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, is grappling with daunting budget shortfalls. He too is calling for across-the-board cuts, and he too is meeting resistance from city agencies. Fiscal watchdogs say the actions that Mayor Bloomberg takes next month, when he is set to announce deep midyear budget cuts, could go a long way toward determining how well the city navigates its current fiscal straits.
The big questions in city government are how many cuts Mr. Bloomberg will be able to make and whether they will go far enough. The mayor, who has made "We have to do more with less" a personal mantra of sorts, put it bluntly yesterday: "We are going to have to do less. I don't think anybody, seriously, at this point, doesn't understand that."
He also invoked the crisis of the 1970's -- and the takeover by a financial control board, followed by the thousands of layoffs and the closing of hospitals -- to explain why he needs to take tough steps now. "We do not want to go through that again," he said.
The mayor's original goal was to cut all city agencies next month by 7.5 percent, or $1.1 billion, as a way of starting to plug a gap that he says will be $5 billion to $6 billion next year. That was proving difficult, but things got even harder when the sluggish economy lowered city expectations of tax revenue and forced the mayor to announce that the city could face as much as a $1 billion shortfall this year. So this week he ordered another 2 percent in cuts and put a citywide hiring freeze into effect.
There are already plenty of indications that many city agencies now, as in 1974, are having difficulty meeting their targets. One official said that the additional 2 percent cuts were ordered to offset any failure by some of the city's biggest agencies, like the Police and Fire Departments, to meet their goals.
Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged yesterday that the Police and Fire Departments were having difficulty finding workable cuts, saying, "I don't think there's any question they're having a hard time." He also said he had allowed his newly created Department of Education more time to come up with cuts, and he held open the possibility that some agencies could fall short of their goals. "Keep in mind they are targets," he said.
The mayor insisted, though, that he would ultimately have his way. "The commissioners work for the City of New York, and will effect the cuts that the mayor says they have to cut," he said yesterday at a news conference in the Tweed Courthouse. "Any commissioner that is thrilled about cutting his agency or her agency probably shouldn't be working here."
He was vague about how much money he hopes to save with the additional 2 percent cuts. His budget director, Mark Page, wrote in a memo that the city's uniformed employees and teachers would be exempt from the cuts, which would seem to spare the city's biggest agencies -- the Police, Fire, Sanitation, Correction and Education Departments -- from the brunt of the cuts. Mayor Bloomberg seemed to imply yesterday that they would still face some cuts, but did not say how much. 
If they are exempted, the 2 percent cut would be worth about $124 million, and if they are included, the savings would grow to $300 million. 
Some monitors expressed surprise that given the city's budget problems, the city did not have an official hiring freeze until this week. Yesterday's issue of The City Record, a government publication, listed dozens of recent new appointments on its "Changes in Personnel" page. Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for the mayor, said the city would not reveal the size of its work force until it alters the budget next month.
Harrison J. Goldin, who was the city comptroller from 1974 to 1989, said it was good to see the mayor trying to address next year's budget problems this year. 
Mr. Goldin said that for all the recent comparisons of the current budget problems with those of the 1970's, the problems were fundamentally different: the city now knows how much money it owes, has access to the credit markets, and is much better at estimating revenue. "The problem now is a yawning budget deficit," he said. "That means that the mayor can focus on that problem. He doesn't have to create an accounting system, win back the credibility of investors, and all the rest. But it's still a worrisome problem."

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN; 
McCall Televises Trump Card

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
 This is a new 30-second commercial that H. Carl McCall, the Democratic candidate for governor, began broadcasting statewide yesterday.

PRODUCER -- GMMB

ON THE SCREEN -- Bill Clinton at a rally for Mr. McCall, on a stage crowded with elected officials, including Mr. McCall and Representatives Charles B. Rangel and Nydia M. Velasquez. As Mr. Clinton talks, the commercial shifts to images of Mr. McCall in action as a campaigner (talking to retirees, for example) and as comptroller (scrutinizing computer screens). Some of the images will be familiar to viewers of his previous commercials. Then it's back to Mr. Clinton. At his final words, the stage and the audience break into applause, and these words appear on the screen: "Carl McCall. Democrat. Governor. Vote Tuesday Nov. 5."

THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Clinton: I was a governor for 12 years. When the economy is in bad shape, it's more important to have a good governor. Carl McCall knows how to handle money. He saved the taxpayers millions as comptroller. Born poor, raised by a single mother, he learned from life itself the value of hard work, education and opportunity for everybody.

Somebody in power needs to be thinking about you every day, and Carl McCall will think about you every single day.

ACCURACY -- Some of the claims are true, others are subjective.

SCORECARD -- Finally! Mr. McCall plays the trump card when it comes to bringing Democrats home, something he needs to do quickly. The populist -- and, with Democrats, popular -- Mr. Clinton makes the case for Mr. McCall more convincingly than Mr. McCall does for himself, with a reminder that the candidate overcame humble circumstances to amass a wealth of experience, the element of Mr. McCall's story most likely to appeal to blacks, Latinos and liberal whites. This low-budget, feel-good advertisement even gives the impression of a campaign with momentum. SHAILA K. DEWAN

HEADLINE: McCall and Pataki Preach to the Choirs 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. and JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Campaigning for the second consecutive day with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, H. Carl McCall labored yesterday to inspire Democratic voters in his home base of New York City to go to the polls in record numbers.
 Strategists say Mr. McCall's chance of winning the governor's race hinges on a big turnout in the city, especially among black voters, and his campaign swing through Brooklyn and Queens was clearly aimed at motivating voters. 
 Mr. McCall and Senator Clinton appeared with elected officials and clergy members in front of Brooklyn Borough Hall for a boisterous rally. He also began broadcasting a new campaign commercial featuring former President Bill Clinton, whose popularity among Democrats, white and black, is high. "Bill Clinton is a very popular figure in New York," Mr. McCall said. "I'm delighted that Bill Clinton has endorsed me, is supporting and is raising money for me." 
Gov. George E. Pataki also spent the day trying to inspire his traditional base of supporters, in western New York. For the third time in a week, the governor took a tour by train of depressed counties, this time following the Erie Canal through Niagara, Orleans and Monroe Counties.
The governor also released three new advertisements. One was a television spot in which he speaks Spanish, and two were radio commercials aimed at Haitians and African-Americans.
At three whistle-stop rallies, the governor stuck closely to the same script he has used in the rest of upstate New York. After pronouncing New York the greatest state in the union, the governor touted his efforts to reduce the number of people on welfare, to lower property taxes and to create jobs, especially through tax-free business zones. Flanked by Republican elected officials, Mr. Pataki ended the rallies with exhortations to the crowd to get out the vote.
Mr. Pataki also took pains at each stop to mention the grants and tax incentives he has sprinkled among businesses in the region, striving to show that he has tried hard to reverse the area's long economic slide.
"We are fighting in these times for every single job," the governor said to about 250 Republican officials and party stalwarts who came out to see him at a rally just before the train left Lockport.
But Mr. Pataki is facing deep levels of cynicism and frustration among voters in the region. It is this undercurrent of dissatisfaction that the Independence Party candidate, Tom Golisano, has tapped.
Down the street from the Lockport rally, at Groff's Bar, a handful of unemployed men were starting the afternoon with a beer. Aubrey Pierce, a 48-year-old factory worker with an injured back, said his former employer -- and the main employer in the region -- Delphi Harrison Thermal Systems, which makes radiators for General Motors, had continued to shrink over the last decade, despite grants from the state. Mr. Pierce said he was leaning toward Mr. Golisano. "Tell Pataki to go home," Mr. Pierce said. "He don't do nothing for people around here. We are losing jobs left and right."
Some undecided voters at the rally were ambivalent about whether Mr. Pataki had helped them. The school property tax rebates Mr. Pataki instituted in his second term made it possible for Howard and Marilyn Halbig, a retired couple, to hold onto their house, they said, but local and state taxes were still too high in their eyes. The economy, too, has failed to improve, they said. "It seems like we need a shakeup," Mrs. Halbig said.
In Albion, about 200 supporters turned out to hear Mr. Pataki's stump speech. The governor concentrated mostly on the lagging economy and recalled, as he often does, the devastating impact the closing of a yeast factory had on his hometown when he was a boy.
Mr. Pataki finished his tour in Brockport, a suburb of Rochester, the home territory of Mr. Golisano. About 75 people braved wintery cold to hear Mr. Pataki talk about his vision of turning the old Erie Canal into a spine of high-tech companies.
Mr. Golisano, meanwhile, continued to hammer Mr. Pataki's record on economic issues as he campaigned in Albany, asserting that Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany have seen the slowest growth in jobs in the nation over the last two years. Mr. Golisano also portrayed Mr. Pataki as being out of touch with conservatives in upstate counties who had supported him in the past.
"Who thought a year ago or even six months ago he would be moving so far to the left to attract New York City voters and forgetting about, or seemingly forgetting about, upstate, where his base was?" Mr. Golisano said in an interview on WROW, the Albany radio station. "In lots of parts of the state, we're not feeling economically secure. We're still losing jobs. We're still losing young people."
Mr. Golisano made his own pitch to city voters by saying he would reform the school property tax rebate system to include benefits for apartment dwellers.
While Mr. Pataki and Mr. Golisano tussled for the hearts of upstate voters, Mr. McCall had one of his busiest days yet. In the morning, he greeted subway riders near Brooklyn College before attending a groundbreaking ceremony for a housing development in the Weeksville section of Brooklyn. At Borough Hall, Mr. McCall appeared with Representative Major Owens and the Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz, and other elected officials.
"People know me," Mr. McCall said, after being asked whether he remained unknown to a large portion of the electorate. "People are learning about me, and when they learn about me and my record, they come and vote for me."
Senator Clinton urged voters to turn out for Mr. McCall. "Carl McCall comes to this race better qualified than anybody who's ever run for the office," she said. "Let's make it a big victory for the next governor."
Last night, Andrew M. Cuomo, the former federal housing secretary who was Mr. McCall's opponent in the Democratic primary, was to be the host of a fund-raising event in Manhattan. The event was expected to raise $100,000 for Mr. McCall's campaign.

HEADLINE: Art and Anxiety; 
Economic Fears Cast Shadows Over Fall Auctions

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
When times get tough, art pours onto the market. Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips, de Pury & Luxembourg will offer more than $400 million of art in the November fine art sales in New York over the next two weeks, including works by masters like Picasso and Monet, Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns. While the monetary total is not unusually high, the sheer number of works for sale this fall has increased. Some is being sold by people in financial distress, but many other sellers think this is the moment to cash in.
 The question is whether collectors will have the appetite, never mind the means, to buy. 
 This season's sellers are a disparate bunch, from the San Francisco investment banker Thomas Weisel and the telecommunications entrepreneur Craig McCaw to Elizabeth Taylor; the publisher of Penthouse, Robert C. Guccione; and Jocelyne Wildenstein, the former wife of the art dealer Alec Wildenstein. 
Clearly many sellers are nervous. While in the past a few insisted on clauses in their contracts giving them the option of pulling their art at the last minute in the event of war, another devastating terrorist attack or a dramatic collapse of the economy, experts say, more sellers asked for this provision this season.
That's not the only reassurance being sought by sellers this fall. Cast an eye on the tiny dots next to major works in the catalogs, indicators of financial deals promised to sellers in the form of guarantees (an undisclosed sum regardless of the outcome of the sale) or outright purchases by the auction house.
This mix of huge monetary commitment and small profit margins can be hair-raising for any business. In the mid-90's it set the stage for the biggest scandal to hit the art world when top executives of Sotheby's and Christie's colluded in an effort to break the chain of ruthless competition. Their wide-ranging price-fixing scheme followed. The two auction houses swore they would never again engage in such practices, no matter how extreme the economic environment. And it is extreme right now.
"We're killing each other again" with the current financial pressures, said one auction house expert, who would speak only on condition of anonymity. All three auction houses are in a predicament: Sotheby's is publicly courting a buyer; Christie's owner, the French financier Francois Pinault, is said to be quietly looking to sell Christie's, too, although Christie's officials deny this. And without the backing of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which has sold most of its stake in Phillips, its costly arrival as a player can be described as shaky at best.
Yet the health of the auction houses has little to do with whether a collector decides to spend millions on a work of art. And while few will publicly admit it, experts at all three houses are bracing for greater numbers of unsold works this season, especially anything less than the best.
"People are obsessed with iconic works," said Tobias Meyer, director of Sotheby's contemporary art department worldwide and one of its chief auctioneers. "The market has reached a level where strong prices will be achieved for the best, but there will be a dip in the midrange." 
Significantly, the spotlight will not be on the Impressionist and modern art sales, the traditional bread and butter of the auction business. The most important consignments are postwar and classic contemporary art, with Sotheby's and Christie's each securing an important collection of works by artists like Lichtenstein, de Kooning, Warhol and Kline.
Of the two houses, Sotheby's made the biggest score. On Nov. 12 it will be selling a group of 21 works, predominantly Abstract Expressionist paintings and drawings collected by Mr. Weisel. Estimated to bring between $43.4 million and $60.7 million, they include five de Koonings spanning several decades.
Among the best, experts say, is "Orestes" (1947), one of de Kooning's nine black and white abstractions, six of which are in museums. A melange of interlocking forms, it is estimated that it will bring $8 million to $10 million. Also part of the Weisel collection is Kline's "Ninth Street," (1951) another black and white abstraction, this one shown at the legendary Ninth Street exhibition in Greenwich Village organized by Leo Castelli the year it was painted. Sotheby's estimates it could bring $4 million to $6 million.
To ease the financial risk at a time when the company is for sale, Sotheby's joined forces with Mitchell-Innes & Nash, Manhattan dealers, to help finance the guarantee.
Rather than guarantee its big postwar collection, Christie's chose to buy outright nine works estimated to bring $14.2 million to $20 million at its Nov. 13 sale. The works are from the Israel Phoenix Assurance Company, one of the few corporate collections in Israel, formed by Joseph Hackmey, the company's former managing director.
Included are paintings by American postwar masters like Jasper Johns, Barnett Newman, Robert Rauschenberg and Mark Rothko. Perhaps the rarest of the group is Newman's "White Fire 1" (1954), one of his mature abstractions. It consists of an aqua background punctuated by two zips, as he called them: a wide, pale-beige band on the left and a bleeding blue stripe on the right. Christie's estimates it will bring $4 million to $6 million.
Pop Art is also well represented this season. Both Sotheby's and Christie's have put Lichtensteins on their catalog covers. Sotheby's image is "Step-On Can With Leg," a classic 1961 Pop image of a woman showing off her new garbage can. The sale estimate is $2 million to $3 million.
"Happy Tears," Christie's cover image, painted just three years later, is a close-up of a woman with flaming red hair holding her head in her hands and crying with a big smile on her face. It is being sold by Robert and Janet Kardon. (He is the former director of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia and the former director of the American Craft Museum in Manhattan.) Christie's estimates that the painting could fetch $5 million to $7 million. But experts say that to wrest it away from the competition, the auction house gave the Kardons a guarantee of nearly $6 million. 
With the rise in prices for Warhols last year, his works in every style and period are being offered by sellers betting on even stronger prices this season. Two are standouts. At Christie's "Big Electric Chair" (1967), an arresting image with a sugar-coated pink background, is being offered by Mr. Pinault, the auction house's owner. Christie's estimates that the work, part of Warhol's "Death and Disaster" series, could bring $3 million to $4 million.
Sotheby's has "Lavender Marilyn (1)" from 1962. This early example of Warhol's Marilyn series has particularly luxurious coloring. It is expected to bring $4 million to $6 million.
Phillips has its star Warhol, too, at its sale of contemporary art on Nov. 11. The most expensive work being offered, "Silver Liz," a 1963 image of Ms. Taylor, had been up for sale in June at the Basel Art Fair, where Richard Gray, the Chicago art dealer, sold it to Jose Mugrabi, the Manhattan dealer, for around $3 million. Mr. Mugrabi turned around and put it up for sale at Phillips, which has given him a guarantee said to be near its $4 million low estimate.
"We're confident we'll sell it," said Michael McGinnis, head of Phillips contemporary art department. "Until Basel it hadn't been on the market for a long period of time." 
Michel Strauss, a 38-year Sotheby's veteran who now works at Phillips, is confident that the auction house will sell a Matisse cut-out that is one of the stars of its Impressionist and modern art sale on Monday. It, too, has been around the market recently. The work, "Tree and Flower (Mural Scroll, No. 1)," was offered privately at Sotheby's earlier this year with an asking price of around $6 million. Several dealers were also approached to try to sell the cut-out. It, too, comes with a guarantee.
"We've taken into account all the various factors," Mr. Strauss said, adding that he believed it had not sold because "it never got to auction until now."
For experts in Impressionist and modern art there were no big collections to fight for this season. "We put together the sale work by work," said David Norman of Sotheby's.
One of the most sought after works at Sotheby's sale on Tuesday is likely to be a Giacometti from the estate of the retailer Stanley Marcus, "Figure Walking Between Two Houses"(1950). It is one of Giacometti's rare depictions of a female figure in motion, encased in a rectangular box. Marcus bought the sculpture for $750 the year after it was made. Sotheby's estimates it will bring $2 million to $3 million.
Cezanne's "Standing Nude Woman" (1898-99), an image of a woman set against a brown background, may be a work more geared to the scholar or museum. Thought to be the only large-format figure Cezanne ever painted, it is expected to bring $10 million to $15 million. While the catalog says it is being sold from a private trust, dealers say the trust is for Mrs. Wildenstein. 
Two works at Christie's sale on Wednesday are sure to test the market's particular interest in modern painting and sculpture. Both belonged to Norman Granz, the jazz impresario, who died last year. Both failed to sell in 1995, when Sotheby's offered them. One is Leger's "Two Acrobats" (1918), which is now estimated to sell for $6 million to $8 million. The other is "Monkey and Her Child," a Picasso sculpture from 1951; Christie's estimates it will fetch $5 million to $7 million. Both have been guaranteed by the auction house.
"These are two examples which we believe will show how tastes have changed over the last seven years," said Christopher Eykyn, a director of Christie's Impressionist and modern art department, "not only for modernist works but also for a more intelligent understanding and desire for sculpture."

HEADLINE: Antitrust Enforcement 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 You wrote (Business Day, Oct. 26) that "the Bush administration has made antitrust enforcement a low priority." In fact, since we assumed office nearly 17 months ago, the Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission have maintained a vigorous level of enforcement, rivaling and in some respects surpassing our Democratic predecessors. 
Indeed, an Aug. 9 front-page article detailed how the United States planned to "step up" antitrust enforcement on health care. 
 The agencies have undertaken dozens of enforcement actions in industries that matter most to consumers and the economy, including energy, health care and computer software. The agencies have challenged 53 mergers and have undertaken 15 civil enforcement actions against harmful business conduct. The Justice Department has secured almost $125 million in criminal fines and convictions of 24 corporations and 25 individuals.
Thus, the record reveals the agencies' strong commitment to aggressive antitrust enforcement.

HEADLINE: Slowdown? Don't Tell Toyota Motor 

BYLINE:  ByKEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Few companies can make the extraordinary look more ordinary than Toyota.
 In almost methodical fashion, the world's third-largest automaker reported record sales, operating income and net profit figures for the first half of the Japanese fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. Seemingly unperturbed by growing signs of a global economic slowdown, the company is sticking with its goal of notching record sales for the full year as well. 
 In standing by its forecasts, Toyota Motor believes it can continue to steam ahead even as its rival, Honda Motor, takes pause. On Monday, Honda, Japan's No. 2 carmaker, trimmed its full-year sales targets at home. While Toyota is also exposed to the fragile Japanese economy, it feels it can offset any declines through stronger sales in North America, where its Lexus brand, minivans and sport utility vehicles sell well. 
Toyota, like Honda, Nissan Motor and other Japanese car builders, earns the bulk of its profits in North America, and it is there that attention is focused. After several banner years, United States carmakers have been forced to entice consumers with cheap auto loans. Japanese makers have been less willing to offer those incentives, so their balance sheets are more stable.
More important, Japanese manufacturers tend to outsell their American rivals in economic slowdowns as cost-conscious consumers switch to cars they believe are more affordable. As a result, Toyota's sales jumped 17 percent in North America between April and September, helping push worldwide sales 15.4 percent higher. By cutting costs and taking advantage of a weaker yen, Toyota also increased net profits 90 percent, to a record 554 billion yen ($4.5 billion).
The recent closing of ports on the West Coast of the United States halted production at many Japanese factories in America, Toyota's included. The company said the strike would force it to spend an additional 10 billion yen ($81 million). But the company is comfortable that its full line of cars can withstand any dip in sales in the United States, regardless of the labor action.
"We don't believe there is any substantial risk to the market in the second half of the year," said Ryuji Araki, executive vice president at Toyota. "Perhaps the market won't be as high as last year, but we don't anticipate any significant declines."
Toyota's Achilles' heel remains in Japan, where it holds 42 percent of the market. Sales fell 4.9 percent in the half year as demand for smaller cars that cost less than 1.5 million yen ($12,200) chews into Toyota's mainstay, the family sedan. In fact, Honda's compact, the Fit, is on track to become the best-selling car in Japan this year, displacing Toyota's Corolla, which has held the top spot for 34 years.
Toyota, as well as its Daihatsu subsidiary, faces stiff pressure from Honda, Nissan, Suzuki and others in the small-car market. A sickly economy forced Daihatsu to lower its sales target for this year. To fight back, Daihatsu will release a remake of its hit car, the Move. But analysts say small cars are so cheap that overall sales may still decline even if more are sold.
"The domestic earnings climate remains harsh, and we can clearly see how automakers shifting toward compact cars are likely to face a major negative earnings impact from stagnant volume growth," said Noriyuki Matsushima, an analyst at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney.
With prospects uncertain in Japan, Toyota will once again have to rely on the American consumer for growth. Toyota's well-known brand and range of cars have helped it carve out 10.4 percent of the United States market. But analysts say that if sales wither in the United States, Japanese companies will not be spared.
"Toyota's American sales are strong, but if we get a double-dip recession in the United States, the market will decline," said Koji Endo, an auto analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Tokyo. "Toyota is relatively stronger than the Big Three, but they'll still be hurt."

HEADLINE: Off to the Country, Packing a Vote 

BYLINE:  By RALPH GARDNER Jr. 

 BODY:
SOME people have discovered how to squeeze a second four-day weekend out of November this year, and it involves an institution even more crucial to democracy than turkey and stuffing.
 "Next week, I'm staying up to vote," said Mary Evans, a Manhattan literary agent, who plans to extend her weekend at her house in the Hudson Valley until Tuesday. Ms. Evans shifted her voter registration to West Taghkanic, in Columbia County, because she is unhappy that St. Lawrence Cement might build a plant nearby. She has decided to express her disapproval not just by putting a "Stop the Plant" sign on her front lawn but by voting for politicians who oppose the project. 
 "The way the local politicians embraced this project, which gave so little and took so much, made me feel I had to move my vox populi upstate pronto," she said. "And I've been encouraging other people to do it." 
In Columbia County, in the Hamptons, on Cape Cod and in other communities, the urge among second-home owners to vote locally is becoming a moral imperative. If cement plants aren't the issue, taxation without representation is, as it was on Long Island, where the Southampton Association, a watchdog group that includes part-time residents, helped fight a local water tax. In Truro, on Cape Cod, a nonresident taxpayers' association has been formed to persuade people to register to vote to stop a new 50,000-square-foot commercial building and to protect the environment.
To vote where they have weekend homes, individuals must of course give up the right to vote where their primary residences are -- except in Mountain Village, Colo. In 1996, the United States District Court in Denver upheld the right of homeowners in that gated community to vote both there and at their primary residences. More than 80 percent of the residents live elsewhere but are sent ballots for Mountain Village elections.
Columbia County's political establishment, which supports the cement plant, is not thrilled that city folk might affect local elections. Gerald Simons, chairman of the County Board of Supervisors, uses the example of school sports programs. "The local people may feel it's good for their kids to have their sports," he said, "and yet somebody who has no real interest in it because their kid goes to school somewhere else may vote to cut the school budget, which really isn't fair."
Mr. Simons wasn't speaking hypothetically. Recently, Sheldon Evans, a Manhattan real estate executive and a weekender in Ghent, N.Y., initiated a registration drive among second-home owners called Vote Columbia. Mr. Evans wrote to some 2,500 people who receive their local tax bills in New York City and its environs. "Columbia County has been saddled with an entrenched county government unresponsive to many constituents' interests," he wrote. "The only way to make certain your voice is heard is for a member or members of your household to register to vote in Columbia County."
He included a voter registration form and a letter from a law firm offering the opinion that registering upstate would not imperil the rent-controlled or rent-stabilized status of their New York City apartments. Mr. Evans said about 100 people have reregistered.
"The reaction from the powers that be was terribly negative," said Mr. Evans, who lives in the East Village during the week. "Almost an angry reaction that there would be a group of new voters coming in."
Arthur Stoerzinger agreed that full-time residents like himself were angered by Mr. Evans's efforts. "You should vote where you wake up in the morning," said Mr. Stoerzinger, executive director of the Hudson Valley Environmental/Economic Coalition, which favors the cement plant. The group has organized a counterdrive to register more local voters who support the plant.
He described Vote Columbia as "a group of people saying, 'You, too, would be against it if you knew better, and since you don't, we'll lead the way.' "
Alexander Keyssar, a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and the author of "The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States," said, "The communities that people belong to and are affected by public action are not necessarily identical to their communities of official residence."
Richard Briffault, the vice dean of the Columbia Law School, was one of the lawyers in a case that recently went to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, asking that Harold M. Wit be allowed to vote in both East Hampton and New York City. The court refused to overturn a lower court's dismissal of the suit, but Mr. Briffault said he does not expect the issue to go away.
"I think this is going to be a growing challenge for what we mean about a residence," he said. "It usually means a commitment about a place, and with communications and transportation and growing affluence, many people have two homes, and they are not that far apart. They look at both as home."
Lee Daghlian, director of public information for the New York State Board of Elections, said nothing prevents people from voting where they spend their weekends.
Of course, a passion for local politics isn't necessarily the only reason that owners of second homes change their registration. Teton County, Wyo., the home of Jackson Hole, for example, has gotten so many wealthy newcomers that during the most recent reapportionment, the county picked up half a state senator and a state representative. "A lot of these folks come here from states that have state income tax," said Sherry Daigle, the county clerk. "I'd assume a lot of the reason they'd want to change their primary residence is because we don't."
David Kapell, the mayor of Greenport, N.Y., where he has a real-estate agency, maintains that local politicians have more to lose by discouraging second-home owners from voting in their weekend and summer communities than from embracing them. He has tried to recruit seasonal residents, who make up 25 percent of Greenport's property owners, to register there.
"You can only divide a community by disenfranchising a constituency," he said, "and a divided community is a weak community."
He said the village had no problem garnering favorable votes for projects that some people might expect part-time residents to oppose for their effect on taxes. (Greenport has built one of the largest skate parks in the Northeast and a multimillion-dollar waterfront park on Long Island Sound.) "I think people are much more thoughtful and, frankly, generous than that," he said.
People who have changed their registration from places like New York City (where the power of their vote is diluted among hundreds of thousands) report pleasant culture shock at receiving personal visits from politicians in their weekend communities, where some elections can turn on one or two votes.
Beba Shamash, a Manhattan costume designer, changed her registration last year to East Hampton, N.Y., where she has a weekend house, so she could join those voting against a low-income housing project planned for her road. She said her candidate lost by a slim margin, but that will not discourage her from voting again in East Hampton this year. "I feel like my voice is heard more out there," she said.
Ken Carlson, a retired New York City advertising executive, takes Election Day as a signal to migrate back from Camden, Me., where he lives from April through October. He and his wife switched their voter registration to Camden in the 1970's because he thought he could better influence issues like drug use among teenagers. "We come back right after we vote," he said.
For Mary Evans, the decision to switch her registration to Columbia County harked back to her childhood in Indiana, where her family was involved in state politics. (Her great-grandfather Warren T. McCray was a governor.) She says she found something akin to that involvement as soon as she moved her voting address upstate. "I registered to vote, and one of the candidates sent me an e-mail outlining her platform," she said. "I also got a letter from my state senator asking me all my opinions on things. I was like, 'Wow! I'm the belle of the ball here.' "

HEADLINE: To the Liberal Arts, He Adds Computer Science 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: PRINCETON,N.J. 

 BODY:
TALL and slender with a flowing beard, dressed in a gray sweater and jeans, Brian Kernighan works his audience with a fast patter and a ready smile. The challenge he has set for himself is to demystify computing for a classroom full of liberal arts undergraduates at Princeton. 
 It so happens that Mr. Kernighan, 60, is a renowned computer scientist, a member of the Bell Labs team of the late 1960's and 70's that developed and nurtured the Unix operating system and the C programming language, innovations with a far-reaching impact on computing. He is also a best-selling author of technical books on programming that have sold millions of copies and been translated into more than 20 languages. 
 None of that really matters in this course, "Computers in Our World." The students are headed toward degrees in politics, history, English, art history, psychology and economics. Unlike many college students in the dot-com boom years of the late 90's, they have no plans to make a killing, or even a living, in the technology business. 
 Yet at a time when the corporate world and Wall Street are in the funk of a technology hangover, the students in Mr. Kernighan's class have a perspective that seems a levelheaded antidote to the prevailing gloom, based on conversations with a few of them. They have no illusions that computing is a silver bullet for the economy or a sure-fire path to riches. But they grew up surrounded by personal computers and cellphones. E-mail, instant messaging, Web searches, online shopping and swapping MP3 music files are second nature to them. They understand that computing is the modern tool used for everything from Hollywood special effects to unraveling the secrets of the human genome.
 They don't believe that digital technology is inundating modern life at the alarming speed of "a Bengali typhoon," as Wired magazine once put it, but view it more as a rising tide whose impact is spreading steadily. Computing, they figure, is a good thing to know more about and to understand in a deeper way - while satisfying that pesky requirement that all Princeton students must take a course in "quantitative reasoning."
 Mr. Kernighan, it seems, has made some encouraging progress with the fall semester class. The students do projects like making their own Web pages and writing a few simple programs. And they speak of a new appreciation for computers and moments of epiphany along the way. 
 "I've always used computers, but I had no prior knowledge of what goes on inside them," said Lori Piranian, a freshman. "Taking the course has given me a new respect for computing. It's amazing what goes into a computer and the history of how we got to where we are now."
 Mr. Kernighan's course is a kind of intellectual smorgasbord, combining public policy -- like technology's impact on privacy, copyright and antitrust matters -- with large helpings of practical knowledge of how things work, from operating systems to disk drives. Still, some students said that the single class session that made the strongest impression was Mr. Kernighan's lecture on binary numbers, also known as binary digits or bits. In his talk, Mr. Kernighan explained that everything a PC does -- handling text, music or video -- is all just a matter of processing 1's and 0's to the machine. The difference between today's multimedia notebooks and the room-size calculators of computing's early days, he notes, is mainly faster bit-processing engines and increasingly clever software.
 "What you come to understand," said Joseph Falencki, a junior, "is how simple, yet how complicated, a computer really is. That was the 'aha' moment for me." 
 After a late-October class, Mr. Kernighan explained that his goal in the course was to impart an intelligent skepticism about computer technology, an informed sense of its possibilities and limitations. "And you can't do that in the abstract," he said, which is why programming and projects are essential elements in his course. Smiling, he mentioned the often-quoted line from the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." A wonderful phrase, Mr. Kernighan said, "but there is no magic." 
 Mr. Kernighan acquired his taste for teaching while on a year's leave from Bell Labs in 1996 at Harvard, where he taught an introductory computer science course. "I got an enormous kick from it," he said. "To me, it felt the way it must be for an actor onstage -- the rush when it clicks, and the letdown when it doesn't."
 So four years later, when Princeton asked him to join the faculty, Mr. Kernighan agreed and said he wanted to teach computing to liberal arts students as well as his Advanced Programming Techniques course in the computer science department. His former colleagues were not surprised that he turned to teaching, including teaching nontechnical students. 
 "It's pretty clear that Brian has a continuing interest and commitment to education -- writing well-read books was how this was first expressed," said Dennis Ritchie, creator of the C language. Indeed, the best-read of his books is "The C Programming Language," written with Mr. Ritchie and first published in 1978. To professional programmers, the book is known simply as "K&R." Most of the text, the programming examples and problems came from Mr. Kernighan, whom Mr. Ritchie calls "a fluent and charming writer on technical subjects."
 Mr. Kernighan genuinely enjoys translating his technical field and explaining its significance for humanities students. But in his understated way, he also thinks it is something that must be done and perhaps contributes to the greater good. "For better or worse, the people who become leaders and decision makers in politics, law and business are going to come from schools like Princeton," Mr. Kernighan said. "What I'm trying to do is give them some of the tools of the trade that will make it possible for them to think intelligently about this technology for themselves."
 Such sentiments place Mr. Kernighan within the camp of computer scientists who believe that computing deserves a place in general education. 
 It is a point of view with a rich history, dating at least as far back as the 60's at Dartmouth. As the impact of computers spread through society, two professors, John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz, decided that Dartmouth students should have hands-on experience with computers. With the university's full-fledged support, they designed a computer time-sharing system and a simple programming language, Basic (Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), which proved to be an enduring contribution to computing. Stripped-down versions of Basic became the programming choice of the microcomputer industry in the mid-70's. One variant, Microsoft Basic, was the founding product of the world's biggest software maker. 
 Some computer scientists have pushed ever since to make computing a central part of a liberal arts education. In 1999, a report by the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, titled "Being Fluent with Information Technology" called for a broader definition of computer education that would emphasize not just practical skills but also concepts, principles and ideas. That is, precisely the sort of course Mr. Kernighan is teaching at Princeton.
 In an October class focusing on computer operating systems, he began with a newspaper article on the challenge Microsoft faces from Linux, a descendant of the Unix operating system that is distributed free and written and debugged by a volunteer community of programmers. (Incidentally, Mr. Kernighan gave Unix its name back at Bell Labs in 1970.) The governments of China, Germany and other nations are using and promoting Linux as an alternative to Microsoft's Windows operating system. "It's that important to them, to become less dependent on Microsoft," Mr. Kernighan said. "To do that, they will use Linux instead of a program written by one of the premier technology companies in the world."
 Twenty years ago, Mr. Kernighan observed, "Only nerds cared about operating systems." Now, he added, the subject is a public-policy issue, even front-page news occasionally. 
 He traffics in metaphor and analogy. The operating system is a juggler, keeping several different programs running at once -- like balls in the air. He compares file folders, which show links to files on the hard disk, to a library card catalog, which "is not the books but the structural information that tells where things are," like the file folders in a computer system.
 There is no mention in class of Mr. Kernighan's distinguished background. But most of the students have run a Google search or two on Mr. Kernighan and seem somewhat impressed. "He wrote that book on the C language back at Bell Labs a long time ago, before I was born," said Ms. Piranian, who is all of 18.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: SECURITY; 
For Americans in Mideast, Daily Balance of Risk

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Jack E. Davis, a professor on leave from the University of Alabama at Birmingham to teach American Studies here, spent all day holed up in his apartment after a friend called to tell him an American diplomat had been assassinated. 
 "You don't know who is lurking out there and what they are thinking," he said, summarizing his anxiety. By the time he was forced to venture out at dusk to lecture, however, he had convinced himself that coping with danger would be preferable to letting it blight his first expatriate experience. 
 So he lies. 
"When people ask me if I'm an American I tell them, 'No, I'm from Canada,' " Mr. Davis said. He acknowledged that the deception is hardly foolproof, because one taxi driver happily announced he had lived in Montreal for 10 years. "I kept hoping he wouldn't ask me any questions, since I've only been to Canada twice. I thought I would tell him the Expos are a great team or something." 
These are days of deep angst for Americans overseas, perhaps nowhere more than in the Middle East. Given the overtly hostile feelings that swirl around them daily, Americans try to balance the benefits of living here with the potential risks.
"I've ridden through a lot of anti-American sentiment and it always gives me pause," said Alain McNamara, who is the executive director of the Fulbright Commission here and has lived and worked in Arab countries for the better part of 20 years. "I have a job, a mission that I feel strongly about. But if it reaches a stage where my family, my security cannot be assured, I will go home to the States. I hope that day will never come."
The potential danger facing Americans, and most other Westerners, materialized in sharp relief in Jordan on Monday when Laurence Foley, a 60-year-old senior administrator with the U.S. Agency for International Development, was gunned down at close range in his driveway. His body was flown home Wednesday. The attacker remains at large.
Last week, Amman was considered a drowsy capital removed from the region's violent eddies. This week, Americans here are assessing how to lower their profiles.
The villa housing the Fulbright Commission, for example, has a number of English and Arabic signs out front marking it as a place where Americans gather. The biggest one, reading The Jordanian-American Commission for Educational Exchange, its formal title, will likely come down, Mr. McNamara said. 
In addition, he will reluctantly accept guards again. Things did not go well the last time they were posted in front of the building, when the United States bombed Iraq in December 1998. The guards spilled diesel fuel on the porch to light fires to keep themselves warm. There was no toilet, so they used the garden. The neighbors accused one of seducing their maid. 
Mr. McNamara also started varying his routine this week. He checks under the car before he starts it each morning. He avoids the most direct route to work. "I have to remember not to be comfortable," he said.
When Mr. McNamara was working for a private American educational foundation here in 1983, with emotions still running high over the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, someone placed a satchel bomb on the window sill. No one was hurt, but it reduced the foundation's library to rubble. 
"I'm always aware of the one person, the one idiot, the one fanatic, that is all that it takes," Mr. McNamara said. He said his main concern is for the 14 or so Americans who are on in Jordan on stipends to study, conduct research or teach. Two of them, Mr. Davis, 46, and Christopher Wise, 41, constitute pretty much the entire faculty at the American Studies graduate program at the University of Jordan. It is billed as the only one of its kind in the region. 
The bile that colors the students' attitudes toward the United States sometimes floors Mr. Wise, a professor at Western Washington University who is here for two years. "One student said that the reason she was in this course was that she wanted to learn about her enemy," he said. 
The professor finds Amman's streets a reliable gauge of the mood toward the United States. 
"If George Bush gives a speech, the way that he speaks, the clothes that he wears, the things he says, the things he doesn't say, all translate immediately in the way people feel on the street," he said. 
Mr. Wise remembers that when Mr. Bush was shown last spring at his ranch wearing a T-shirt while he commented on escalating violence in the Middle East, Jordanians were insulted, thinking he was brushing off the issue. Sometimes the normally friendly college guards ignore his greetings, and taxi drivers shout at him. He said he could usually defuse the situation by expressing his view that Washington is biased against Arabs.
The Bush speech at the United Nations laying out the case for a war against Iraq convinced Mr. Wise that it was no longer prudent to keep his wife and four young children here. They are flying home in a few weeks.
His wife teaches at the American Language Center, an English school supported by the American Embassy. The school started receiving police protection this week, and the teachers there now worry that keeping their sign up is dangerous, Mr. Wise said. "My wife said they should just put up a huge sign saying 'soft target,' " Mr. Wise said.
Among the more than 100 American diplomats here, there is no consensus on whether their work makes them less or more safe. Mr. Foley, the assassinated diplomat, was protected by a standard system of random patrols that Western missions here had considered adequate. Some of the envoys say they think the embassy's high walls and guards afford them a measure of safety that those outside lack. Others think their jobs and the places they frequent, like the American high school, make them more vulnerable. 
The American ambassador to Jordan, Edward W. Gnehm, said he still considers the level of security for Westerners here to be good. 
"This kind of killing unsettles people, but underlying everything, most people feel there is good security in this country," he said, adding, "Many expatriates are feeling ill-at-ease right now, not just Americans."
American citizens living here say the tide of anti-American feeling has been running high since Sept. 2000, when the Palestinian uprising against Israel started. They say they are worried it might spill over if the United States leads an attack on Iraq. Americans here last April saw the security forces crack down on demonstrators on the streets, and they say they believe the government will crack down again if emotions continue to rise. But they recognize that to a large extent they have to rely on themselves. 
"I'm not worried that if the U.S. invades Iraq, the Jordanians will rise up and seek out Americans to murder," Mr. Davis said. "But I think I'll still call myself a Canadian."

HEADLINE: An Olympic Mistake 

BYLINE:  By Wendy Fried; Wendy Fried is a lawyer.

 BODY:
This weekend the United States Olympic Committee will choose either New York City or San Francisco as this country's candidate to host the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. NYC 2012, the committee representing New York's bid to bring the games here, says that 84 percent of city residents support the idea.
 I find this strange, since as an ordinary Manhattan resident I have yet to meet a single supporter. In my own Chelsea neighborhood, a dozen blocks south of the proposed site for the 86,000-seat Olympic stadium, the prevailing reaction is a roll of the eyes. This gesture signifies the local belief that bringing such an event to Midtown Manhattan -- and building the necessary structures to support it -- would be so magnificently stupid that it could surely never happen. 
 A naive belief, I'm afraid. Perhaps New Yorkers, distracted by threats of terrorism and other unpleasant matters, have failed to notice how easily NYC 2012 has muscled past other American cities competing for this honor, with full support from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki. Using a campaign studded with cliches about New York's energy and competitive drive, while at the same time deftly playing the Sept. 11 sympathy card, NYC 2012 has done an impressive job.
The NYC 2012 Web site gives one the feeling that being a candidate for Olympic host city is a lot like running for high school class president. The site is loaded with bouncy slogans (like "We're Game") and long lists of promotional events (like mowing the NYC 2012 logo into the Bryant Park lawn). The city's formal submission to the U.S.O.C., written with the breathless optimism of pre-Sept. 11, pre-recession New York, is also filled with public relations fluff of the highest order. You have to respect any writer who can almost persuade you that the No. 7 subway line embodies "everything the Olympics are all about." Take that, John Rocker.
The bid book and Web site detail the locations for each event, and there are some curious choices. Archery and beach volleyball in a new Williamsburg waterfront park? Flatwater canoeing in Flushing Meadows? If you're wondering how athletes will get to these places, plans include special high-speed ferry service and commuter trains.
And with all eyes riveted on the redevelopment of downtown Manhattan, NYC 2012 is dangling before the U.S.O.C. an 8.5-acre Olympic square to be built mostly on the rail yards on the far West Side of Manhattan: "the largest new public space carved out of the Manhattan street grid in a century." Of course, it would include a new stadium where the Jets could play all eight of their home games.
If the U.S.O.C. chooses San Francisco on Saturday, we New Yorkers can return to our noisy local arguments about development, in which a community board can spend weeks debating a liquor license for the corner bar. But if New York wins the contest, we may be stuck with the prize.

HEADLINE: War Inflates Cocoa Prices But Leaves Africans Poor 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
As civil war raged in Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer, speculative traders here and in New York sent prices this month to 17-year highs. Investors cashed in, as did middlemen along the global food chain. Candy makers like Hershey and Nestle are thought to have secured their Halloween profits by carefully hedging their exposure.
 But in Africa, war and economics are imposing a harsher tariff. The fighting has killed hundreds of people in cocoa-growing regions, destroyed crops and kept farmers from harvesting what remains -- and sharing in the higher prices. The fighting has also shut down a project to eradicate what international aid workers consider the farmers' abusive child labor practices. 
 Even as persistently small cocoa crops drove prices up over the last two years, cocoa bean farmers enjoyed little of the gain. Under international pressure, Ivory Coast shifted from fixed prices to free-market pricing of cocoa in the fields. Industry experts say that local exporters have systematically shortchanged the growers, buying their beans cheaply and selling at big profits in the rising market. 
"The one person who doesn't benefit very much is the farmer," said Ann Prendergast, an analyst with Refco, a big commodities trading firm in New York. "He really lives a much more precarious existence. The product makes a profit for middlemen all the way." 
The economics of cocoa -- a $5 billion trade that winds from African ports through Dutch and American processing plants to store shelves and children's goody bags -- recall other harsh contrasts in industries like diamonds, textiles and sporting goods, where the glitter of wealth is produced through the sweat of penury.
On one end of the food chain are people like Salifou Kabore, a 57-year-old grower from Burkina Faso who moved to Ivory Coast when he was 5 and is now the owner of two midsize farms, one about 30 acres and the other 37 acres, from which he supports 3 wives and 16 children.
Both his farms lie in the path of a rebellion that took hold with a failed coup d'etat on Sept. 18. The dispute has not been resolved, though the first direct talks aimed at ending the unrest opened today in Lome, Togo.
Suggestions from the Ivoirian government that neighboring Burkina Faso was behind the military revolt set off reprisals against the largely Muslim growers like Mr. Kabore who came here from the north and dominate the cocoa-farming business, adding to their woes.
"I am so sad and bitter because I don't know what is happening in my plantations," Mr. Kabore said in a telephone interview from the still unsettled Daloa region.
Further along the food chain lie London's traders, who serve as brokers between African exporters and Western cocoa processors, or buy and sell speculatively in the futures markets. One trader, Anthony Ward, heads a company called Armajaro that was reported to have bought 150,000 to 200,000 tons of cocoa during the summer -- more than 5 percent of global production -- just before the price soared, to produce a $90 million gain. 
Among fellow traders, Mr. Ward's exploits won him the nickname Chocolate Finger, the name of a British confection as well as a pun on the James Bond character Goldfinger.
Mr. Ward could not be reached for comment, but in an interview with The Independent newspaper, he attributed high cocoa prices to "market fundamentals" after two years of production shortages.
More fortunes were made and lost over the last two weeks. After cocoa soared to a 17-year high of $2,405 a ton on Oct. 11, reports of an Ivoirian truce sent prices tumbling. In trading here today, cocoa settled at $:1,309, or $2,040. 
Prices in London mean little to Mr. Kabore, and news arrives with a long lag time. "I've heard that prices of commodities are going up," he said. "But now, when we could take advantage of it, we are blocked by a war that is none of our business."
Even before the fighting expanded, the growers were in trouble. Under pressure from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Ivory Coast freed up its cocoa market in 1999, abandoning fixed prices in favor of those set by the market. The result is that the cocoa farmers have been persistently underpaid, according to the 42-nation International Cocoa Organization in London.
"Ivory Coast's mostly illiterate farmers are ill equipped to negotiate with hard-bargaining commodity buyers," the group concluded in a report in 2000. A European cocoa industry executive added, "It is somewhat ironic that while European and American agriculture is protected, we should argue to developing countries that they should be fully exposed to the vagaries of the market."
In the meantime, the fighting in Ivory Coast has interrupted a global campaign against child labor abuses in the region.
According to the United States Labor Department, some 284,000 child laborers in West Africa -- 200,000 of them in Ivory Coast -- work in hazardous conditions in the cocoa business. Last year, this began to raise the same kind of protests among advocacy groups that have dogged other industries linked to low-cost third world operations. 
The chocolate industry says that the use of child labor is part of longstanding local tradition that the advocates have distorted for their own ends.
"This was presented as slavery, but it was just the normal practice of families using children to run the family freeholding," said Francois-Xavier Perroud, a spokesman for Nestle in Switzerland.
Nonetheless, the industry has signed onto a project put together by the International Labor Organization, a United Nations specialized agency, aimed at allowing chocolate makers to certify by 2005 that their products are free of abusive child labor. The participants include candy companies like the Hershey Foods Corporation, Mars and Nestle; food processors like Archer Daniels Midland and Barry Callebaut; and various nongovernmental organizations. 
As a first step, the I.L.O. undertook a $6 million effort to chart and begin to eliminate child labor abuses, but withdrew its aid workers as reports began filtering back to Abidjan, the principal Ivoirian city, of bloody fighting in the cocoa-growing belt to the north and west. Eventually, the I.L.O. project will seek to persuade farmers to send younger children to school while ensuring that older children are not exposed to such hazards as handling pesticides or using machetes to clear the underbrush on cocoa plantations.
But child labor is not the bottom-line issue confronting the chocolate business. For two years, the consumption of cocoa has outpaced production and the forecasts for the coming year are for a third deficit, worsened by Ivory Coast's problems during the harvesting season. 
Even before the fighting, the industry was slow to react to the supply-and-demand trend.
"The industry, the users, didn't really believe that the cocoa market was going up and waited a long time" before realizing that prices were likely to climb, said Jean-Michel Boehm, a cocoa analyst with ABN Amro in London. "They did not take cover."
As a result, grinders who buy the raw beans and turn it into cocoa powder and cocoa butter are caught on both sides. Raw material prices are high, but the candy makers they supply will not pay more for semifinished products.
Some smaller grinders, particularly in Asia, have closed plants over the last year, and big chocolate producers like Nestle say they plan to leave the cocoa-grinding business.
To some extent, candy makers are cushioned by the nature of their finished product. Compared with the cost of packaging, marketing and other ingredients, cocoa sometimes represents a modest fraction of the overall cost of a candy bar, said Susan Smith, a spokeswoman for the United States Chocolate Manufacturers Association.
Moreover, the most sophisticated food companies rarely let themselves be surprised by shifts in prices in the commodities markets. 
For example, "Hershey is a very active and very efficient hedger of cocoa," said Leonard Teitelbaum, an analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York. "Cocoa is only one of their commodities. Milk is substantially down in price."
Even so, candy makers feel something of a squeeze as well, with big retail outlets unwilling to countenance price increases on individual chocolate bars.
"We are working on tighter margins than we used to," said David Zimmer, secretary general of Caobisco, the European candy makers' association. 
Half a world away, the concerns are more vivid.
"We hold the cocoa economy in our hands," Mr. Kabore said, referring to growers like himself from Burkina Faso and Mali. Yet now, "we are forced to live like rats, hidden away in our homes."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: EAST ASIA; 
Japan-North Korea Talks Conclude With Deep Splits

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Japan and North Korea ended two days of negotiations here, angrily talking past each other on issues that each side depicts as the major obstacles to normalized relations.
 Japan's insistence on visits by immediate relatives of people kidnapped by North Korea beginning in the late 1970's drew a strong rebuke from North Korean delegates. In much the same spirit, Tokyo said there was no question of long-promised economic aid to its impoverished neighbor until the abduction issue and concerns about North Korea's nuclear weapons program are resolved. 
 Despite the deep divide, the two sides were able to claim modest progress, by agreeing to establish a panel to discuss security issues beginning next month. It was unclear whether North Korea would agree to discuss nuclear arms in that forum. 
Washington has been urging its two main East Asian allies, Japan and South Korea, to demand that North Korea abandon efforts to produce highly enriched uranium. The North Korean nuclear program, which violates a 1994 weapons control agreement, had been conducted in secret, until the country was confronted with American intelligence last month and forced to acknowledge its activities. 
Since then, the Bush administration has strongly urged Japan not to grant economic aid to North Korea until it consents to the verifiable dismantlement of its uranium program.
For Japan and North Korea, the nuclear issue has dashed recent expectations of a honeymoon, raised after a visit last month by the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, and North Korea's admission that it had kidnapped 13 Japanese citizens. The bitterly estranged nations have never had diplomatic relations, and a reconciliation offered each side something it wanted badly.
For Japan, the expected reward was a political windfall for Mr. Koizumi and a rare taste of diplomatic autonomy from its American ally. For North Korea, at issue was an expected windfall of $10 billion in assistance, offered in settlement of North Korean grievances over colonial atrocities committed by Japan between 1910 and 1945. 
Washington's insistence that its allies withhold economic cooperation with North Korea until security concerns are resolved has removed Japan's principal form of leverage in the talks here, causing North Korea to take a harder line on the kidnapping issue while urging the United States to negotiate with it directly.
"If the Americans will help our country and promise not to attack us, we can solve the nuclear problem," Pak Ryong Yon, the chief North Korean delegate, said at the conclusion of the talks.
After refusing to discuss the nuclear issue here at all on Tuesday, the North Korean delegation today urged Japan to come up with a "package solution" to normalization, implying large amounts of financial aid. "It is clear that Japan should compensate our country for the mental and physical damage it caused us," Jong Thae Hwa, a North Korean ambassador, said, referring to the colonial period.
Responding to the intense emotional focus of public opinion in Japan on the kidnapping issue, the Koizumi government has recently adopted a harder line, saying the 5 survivors among its 13 kidnapped citizens who are visiting Japan now would remain in the country indefinitely, rather than for the two weeks initially granted by Pyongyang.
Japan has also demanded that the kidnapped citizens' spouses and children, who have all remained behind in North Korea, be immediately allowed to join their relatives in Japan.
Japanese diplomats here responded to the North Korean insistence on aid, by simply restating Tokyo's demands on both those kidnapped and on security. "We have ears to listen to your requests," a diplomatic official quoted the chief Japanese delegate, Katsunari Suzuki, as saying. Without satisfaction of Japan's demands, however, he added "there will be no economic aid." 
Although Japan stood its ground during the talks, regional political experts say the abrupt American insistence on security questions has set off a complicated dynamic between the United States and its East Asian allies that North Korea will be keen to exploit.
"The United States wants to isolate North Korea, but the way things are set up is that everyone else is talking to them," said Marcus Noland, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C. "You would expect North Korea to offer something to the Japanese on security to hold off the Americans. From the American point of view, on the other hand, any delay is a good thing because Washington is waiting for Lee Hoi Chang to ride in like the Seventh Cavalry soon and save the day."
Mr. Lee is the leader of the conservative South Korean Grand National Party, and his diplomatic views are said to be close to those of the Bush administration, which has called on Japan, South Korea and China to apply "maximum pressure" on Pyongyang. He is the front-runner in opinion polls for South Korea's presidential elections in December.
The current South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, who has staked his reputation on engagement with North Korea, told an audience of Korean-Americans in Seattle this week that he opposed economic sanctions on Pyongyang. "Sanctions would likely lead to a repeat of the nuclear crisis in the early 1990's," he said.

HEADLINE: Columbia in Talks to Build at St. John 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
The Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine and Columbia University are in discussions about developing the north end and southeast corner of the cathedral's 13-acre grounds in Morningside Heights.
 New structures would appear on either side of the cathedral and its companion buildings and gardens, changing the character of the three-block enclave, called the Close. The trustees of the cathedral, which ran a deficit last year, see the development as a financial necessity. They also envision creating the modern equivalent of a medieval village, centered on the towers and pinnacles of a cathedral. 
 "This Close should have a life of its own," said Henry L. King, president of the cathedral trustees, chairman emeritus of the Columbia trustees and senior counsel at Davis Polk & Wardwell. "This is very important for the continued mission of the cathedral and the conservancy of the buildings that exist. With this development, we would have the ability to meet our budget."
For Columbia, perennially in need of more room, the prospect of "such a beautiful setting so close to our campus is enormously attractive," said Emily Lloyd, the executive vice president for administration, though she said it was too early to specify what might be built.
Even the tentative plans face a hurdle, however, because the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission may designate the entire Close as a landmark.
Hoping that the commission will exempt the potential development sites from consideration, the cathedral has agreed for the first time to accept landmark designation of the main building, still unfinished after 110 years but one of the city's leading attractions. In the past, the trustees have resisted the idea of landmark status for the cathedral on the grounds that it is not yet finished.
Development on the cathedral grounds is sure to be a contentious issue at a commission hearing on Nov. 12.
"Who would want to go to Salisbury Cathedral and think of Constable paintings with little office buildings instead of cows?" asked Robert E. Roistacher of the Morningside Heights Residents' Association. "The cathedral has been an environmental sanctuary in so many ways. I think it's incredibly regrettable that we lose any open space there."
Sherida E. Paulsen, the commission chairwoman, said yesterday that she had not seen the cathedral's full proposal and therefore could not comment on it.
Though development would not provide enough money to resume construction of the cathedral, it would establish the economic footing necessary for a future capital campaign. Last year, the Episcopal cathedral ran a deficit of $200,000 on an operating budget of $7 million, having suffered a serious fire in December, a sharp drop in visitors and the loss of revenues from its gift shop, which was gutted in the fire.
"If we don't have fiscal credibility, and the cathedral, even if beloved, is considered a black hole, we can't get the money to take care of it, let alone complete it," said the Very Rev. Dr. James A. Kowalski, dean of the cathedral. "People love the cathedral. People want things for the cathedral. They've got to deal with the fiscal issue."
Mr. King said that the development would be "consistent with the mission of the cathedral," whether for educational, residential or office use by nonprofit organizations. The designs would be architecturally compatible, he said. The sites would be leased, not sold.
Given the sometimes stormy history of institutional building in Morningside Heights, the cathedral's parcels have another attraction. "Unlike a lot of other projects," Mr. King said, "this doesn't require the tearing down of buildings or the displacement of people."
Columbia was one of three developers that replied to the cathedral's request for expressions of interest. The others were commercial concerns that Mr. King would not identify. They have not been eliminated from consideration, he said, but St. John will negotiate exclusively with Columbia for nine months.
Mr. Roistacher said that if the cathedral grounds had to be developed at all, Columbia might be preferable "because if it doesn't get its space needs met on that site, it will have to go someplace else" in the neighborhood.
Neither Mr. King nor Ms. Lloyd would estimate the development potential. In the zoning district that the cathedral occupies, a university may construct buildings with 6.5 times as much floor area as their lot size. But it is unclear how large the lots would be.
The trustees are opposed to landmark status for the former Leake & Watts Orphan Asylum, a large Greek Revival structure that predates the cathedral, and Mr. King said they hope the commission defers action on the other buildings around the grounds.

HEADLINE: Audit Overseer Cited Problems In Previous Post 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Shortly before William H. Webster was appointed to head a new board overseeing the accounting profession by the Securities and Exchange Commission last Friday, he told the commission's chairman, Harvey L. Pitt, that he had until recently headed the auditing committee of a company that was facing fraud accusations, Mr. Webster recounted today.
 Mr. Pitt chose not to tell the other four commissioners who voted on Mr. Webster's nomination that day, according to S.E.C. officials. White House officials said they, too, were not informed about the details of Mr. Webster's work for the company. 
 The small publicly traded company, U.S. Technologies, is now all but insolvent and it and its chief executive, C. Gregory Earls, are facing suits by investors who say they were defrauded of millions of dollars. The suits contend the misconduct occurred in late 2001 and this year. That was after the three-person audit committee, headed by Mr. Webster, had voted to dismiss the outside auditors in the summer of 2001 after those auditors raised concerns about internal financial controls. 
Mr. Webster, the 78-year-old former director of the C.I.A. and F.B.I., said he told Mr. Pitt and Robert K. Herdman, the agency's chief accountant, about the investor lawsuits before he was approved last Friday.
"I told them that people are making accusations," Mr. Webster said of his conversation with Mr. Pitt before he was appointed last Friday. "I said if this is a problem, then maybe we shouldn't go forward. I raised it because I didn't want it to become an issue."
Mr. Webster said he was assured by Mr. Pitt that the staff of the commission had looked into the issue and that it would not pose a problem. Mr. Pitt had urged Mr. Webster to take the job. 
But U.S. Technologies' former outside accounting firm, other members of the audit committee, company executives, and investors and their lawyers who say they were defrauded say they were never called by anyone at the commission about Mr. Webster's candidacy for the new oversight board. 
Last Monday, three days after Mr. Webster was appointed, he called Mr. Pitt again to say he had heard over the weekend from another former director that a government investigation had recently begun to examine possible fraud by the chief executive of the company, Mr. Webster said. Lawyers involved in the case say the inquiry, by federal investigators in Manhattan, is actually examining whether Mr. Earls, who recruited Mr. Webster, used the company to violate criminal fraud laws. Mr. Webster is not a target of the investigation. Mr. Pitt did not tell the other commissioners about the Monday conversation either, S.E.C. officials said.
Mr. Pitt declined to discuss the selection of Mr. Webster or U.S. Technologies. Christi Harlan, a spokeswoman at the S.E.C., said that Mr. Webster informed the commission's accounting staff, headed by Mr. Herdman, about his service on the board of the company and that the staff concluded that there was nothing worthy of passing on to other commissioners or that would disqualify Mr. Webster.
"What matters is we believe Judge Webster will be a fine chairman of the Public Companies Accounting Oversight Board," Ms. Harlan said.
Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, referred calls about the selection of Mr. Webster to the S.E.C.
The accounting oversight board is the centerpiece of legislation approved this summer in response to the wave of scandals at companies like Enron, Arthur Andersen and WorldCom. It was created to supervise an array of professional issues, including disciplining accountants and inspecting the largest firms. 
The commissioners split bitterly over the qualifications of Mr. Webster and his selection over John H. Biggs, who was considered by some in the profession to be too aggressive. In his dissent, one S.E.C. commissioner, Harvey J. Goldschmid, said the selection process had been flawed and inept and had failed to vet the candidates properly. Mr. Goldschmid declined to comment.
Mr. Webster stepped down from the board of U.S. Technologies in July after he said he was told that it could no longer provide liability insurance for directors and officers against claims from investors.
The company invests in young Internet companies and runs a contract labor company using prison inmates. It has had a variety of legal and regulatory difficulties. While Mr. Webster headed the audit committee, it was delisted from trading on Nasdaq for failing to make timely filings with the S.E.C. 
The suits filed by investors allege that fraud occurred after the company's auditor, BDO Seidman, says it notified the auditing committee in May 2001 that U.S. Technologies had several serious weaknesses in its internal financial controls.
The company initially reported to the S.E.C. that BDO Seidman auditors had been dismissed not because of any disagreements or qualifications but only because of "an explanatory paragraph that discusses factors that raise substantial doubt" that U.S. Technologies had the "ability to continue as a going concern."
But U.S. Technologies was forced to amend its filing a few weeks later, after BDO Seidman executives sent a letter explaining that their firm had found serious accounting problems at the company. 
BDO Seidman accountants wrote: "In a letter dated May 9, 2001, issued on Aug. 31, 2001, and in a telephonic audit committee meeting on July 13, 2001, BDO Seidman L.L.P. communicated a material weakness in internal control to the audit committee and management relating to financial and accounting infrastructure including lack of an experienced C.F.O., deficiencies in recording material transactions timely, and in the organization and retention of financial documents and accounting records." 
Mr. Webster said the company responded by hiring a more experienced chief financial officer. He said the auditing committee did not look into the other problems mentioned by BDO Seidman accountants. He said that executives at U.S. Technologies had been concerned about the auditing bills of BDO Seidman and about the lengthy time it had taken to perform the audits.
BDO Seidman, which will be regulated by the new accounting oversight board, declined through a spokesman to comment about its work for U.S. Technologies.
Lawyers involved in the criminal investigation said there was no evidence that Mr. Webster violated any laws and he was not the target of the inquiry. But critics of his selection to the oversight board said the audit committee's decision not to investigate thoroughly and make public its findings demonstrated that he lacked the qualifications to lead the board.
"Even if we find out that Webster was totally passive in this process, it is an indictment on his ability to run the accounting oversight board," said James D. Cox, a professor of securities and corporate law and author of a textbook on accounting who teaches at Duke. "To let something like this go shows really bad judgment, and I think is automatically disqualifying. At a minimum, the audit committee had an obligation to investigate. This is exactly the kind of situation that the accounting oversight board is supposed to change, and that the new law creating the oversight board is supposed to fix."
Mr. Webster said he did not think his experience at U.S. Technologies "would impair my ability to serve."
"But that is not for me to judge," he said. Speaking of the commission, he added: "I always made a point of telling them everything I knew. I'm sure they wouldn't have gone through with it if they didn't have confidence in me."
At the center of the investigation and the suits over U.S. Technologies is Mr. Earls, the company's chairman and chief executive, who recruited Mr. Webster and other prominent Washington figures to serve on its board and invest in the company. The board members included George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader, and Beth Dozoretz, the former finance chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.
Mr. Earls has recently suffered some court setbacks.
A decision two months ago in one of those cases by a Delaware judge concluded that there was significant evidence he had committed a pattern of misrepresentations "that may rise to the level of criminal conduct" in connection with USV Partners, which Mr. Earls controls and is a large investor in U.S. Technologies. 
The judge also found "credible evidence" that Mr. Earls "has exhibited a pattern of defrauding investors" by using a variety of partnerships and other "special purpose entities" controlled by him. 
After reciting a list of court cases against Mr. Earls, the judge, Vice Chancellor Jack Jacobs, said, "Although claims of wrongful conduct in unrelated cases certainly do not establish that Earls mismanaged USV, the ever-increasing pattern of fraud claims against Earls lends further credibility to the other evidence that does tend to establish that Earls has mismanaged USV."
In a separate civil case filed in July in federal court here, a few days after Mr. Webster resigned from the board, an investor accused Mr. Earls and U.S. Technologies of stealing for Mr. Earls's own benefit almost $2 million last year by diverting what were supposed to be investments. Mr. Earls's lawyers have denied the accusation.
Thomas Green, a lawyer who represents Mr. Earls, said that his client violated no laws and that the company had been a victim of the downturn in the economy.

HEADLINE: B's, Not Need, Are Enough For Some State Scholarships 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

DATELINE: ATHENS, Ga., Oct. 29 

 BODY:
Kelly Ryan has made good use of her college trust fund. It has bought a trusty Honda, trips to Italy, Switzerland, Argentina, some painful lessons about picking her own stocks and, if all goes well, maybe even her first piece of real estate after graduation. About the only thing it is has not paid for is, well, college. 
 No need for that. Ms. Ryan is a scholarship student. 
 "I didn't want to spend thousands of dollars every semester," said Ms. Ryan, 21, a senior at the University of Georgia, where a B average in both high school and college earns a free ride, regardless of one's ability to pay. "Going somewhere else would have left me totally dry." 
Though not exactly ordinary, Ms. Ryan's story is familiar around here. Campus veterans marvel at all the poolside apartments that have sprung up since Georgia popped the income cap off its merit awards. Professors are testing their hypothesis that instead of increasing college enrollment, the state's $1.7 billion scholarship program has been a blessing for the automobile industry -- since so many families roll the savings into buying new cars.
"Yep, that was the big incentive," said Kristin McKenna, a senior who once set her sights far and wide for college, eyeing the distant, shiny coast of California, until her mother stepped forward with what is often called the "UGA exchange" -- get the scholarship, get a car. "I'd say it's pretty commonplace," Ms. McKenna said.
Just how common, researchers cannot say, but one thing is sure. Scholarships open to students like Ms. McKenna, who estimates her parents' income at $200,000 or more, are rising quickly. Though income is still a deciding factor in most awards, particularly federal grants, states and universities are increasingly helping students who were once too well off to qualify.
As a result, the percentage of students from families earning $100,000 or more who get state grants grew seven times faster than those earning less than $20,000 between 1992 and 2000, statistics from the federal Department of Education show. A decade ago, less than 2 percent of the highest-income families got state grants. That figure surpassed 5 percent by 2000, even before many states started giving grants based solely on academic performance, regardless of family income.
University grants to the highest-income students also grew twice as fast as awards to the lowest-income students in the same period, largely out of a recognition that college costs are so high that nearly everyone is feeling the strain. At the beginning of the 90's, fewer than 13 percent of families earning at least $100,000 got grants from the schools they attended. As of last year, more than 20 percent of them did.
The growth of the merit awards has fueled a national debate over the very meaning of scholarships, and who should get them. In some cases, civil rights groups have tried to challenge the new scholarships in court.
"It is inefficient, indeed, inequitable to give public dollars to these kids when they would go to college anyway," said Donald E. Heller, senior research associate at the Center for the Study of Education at Pennsylvania State University. "Historically, the bulk of public investment was made with a mind towards equalizing educational opportunity. With the shift toward merit aid, it's quite clear that there's a change in that philosophy."
Since Georgia instituted its merit scholarships in 1993, trying to stanch the migration of students who ventured off for colleges and seldom returned, at least 11 states have followed its lead. The programs pay full or partial tuition for better-than-average seniors who embrace their local universities, despite what their parents may earn. Some programs also allow students to go outside of the state university system, though it may mean getting less money.
"Of course, they're very popular politically," said David Longanecker, executive director of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, an advisory group for 15 states. "They serve the constituency that votes most often." 
A decade ago, only 12 percent of state grants were for academic merit, not need. As of last year, that had grown to nearly a quarter of state awards. So far, however, the scholarships -- most of which are scarcely five years old -- do not seem to be helping many more students go to college. In Georgia, for example, only about 5 percent of the money goes to students who would have either left the state or skipped college altogether, researchers at the University of Georgia discovered.
"When almost all of the scholarships are going to students who would otherwise have gone to college, then the question is, Where is the money really going?" said Chris Cornwell, an economics professor at the University of Georgia. "Cars, amenity-filled apartments and you can image what else."
But criticizing merit scholarships for not inspiring more people to go to college is misguided, supporters argue, like condemning a jet plane because it falls short of the moon. More than anything, the awards serve as an economic development tool for states desperate to retain their college-bound students, with a particular nod to middle-class families who have long found scholarships elusive.
Before they began offering merit awards, usually with the proceeds from lotteries or with payments from the 1998 tobacco settlement, some states offered relatively few grants, whether for achievement or need. West Virginia, for example, offered only about half of what it plans to provide in awards within three years.
"Isn't it a good thing that the total investment in scholarships is growing?" said Lutz Berkner, senior research associate for MPR Associates, an educational consulting firm. "Something for education has got to be better than nothing."
If there is one thing on which both sides agree it is that merit awards alone are insufficient. Whittling away at high school dropout rates and helping below-average students excel -- so that they, too, can earn scholarships -- calls for a major investment in public schools that few educators or politicians would openly argue against.
Still, defenders say, the merit-based movement is consistent with the fundamental changes coursing through the educational system. Eighteen states already have exit exams that students must pass before receiving a high school diploma, and the demand for rigorous academic standards seems to get louder every year. In that light, supporters argue, consider the exams a stick -- and merit awards the carrot.
"I don't understand how anyone could argue that we shouldn't reward performance," said Dane Linn, director of education for the National Governors Association. "Isn't that the goal of standards-based reform?"
The popularity of these programs is evident from the numbers of students taking part in them. More than 51,000 students won merit awards under Michigan's program this year, the highest number yet. In Florida, more than 92,000 students shared $164 million worth of similar scholarships in the 2000-2001 school year, also a record. 
So popular have such awards become that Tom Golisano, the Independence Party candidate for governor of New York, has made them a centerpiece of his campaign, while lawmakers in Tennessee have broken an 18-year stalemate to place a lottery-for-scholarships referendum on the ballot for the coming election.
"We're losing people to Georgia," said Stephen I. Cohen, the state senator championing the Tennessee initiative. "People are moving over there to get the scholarship money."
As some states have learned, scaling back or tinkering with their scholarships can prove difficult. Concerned that many low-income students have been overlooked by its merit program, Florida legislators have considered shifting more money toward need-based scholarship. But the political resistance they encountered was formidable.
"We have promised these scholarships to people and we can't change the rules in the middle of the game," said Buddy Dyer, a Florida state senator who sits on the education committee.
For all the enthusiasm surrounding them, merit awards have engendered their share of controversy, especially when they use standardized tests to decide who qualifies. At the end of August, seven civil rights groups filed a complaint against Florida's program, contending that its reliance on tests like the SAT discriminates against Latino and black students who may get good grades but cannot afford expensive coaches to help them with the exam.
On the same day, Harvard's Civil Rights Project released a report showing that students from the wealthiest high schools in Florida and Michigan were more than twice as likely to win merit scholarships than their counterparts from the poorest schools.
But are merit scholarships merely the domain of privileged students who may not need them? No, the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators says. It estimates that two-thirds of state merit award winners demonstrate some degree of financial need, usually to the tune of about $5,100 a year.
Michael Rich's mother works at a cotton mill. His father makes cabinets, and gave him no illusions about their ability to pay the $15,000 worth of tuition needed to put him through the University of Georgia.
"I need my scholarship to get through school," said Mr. Rich, a junior at Georgia. "Granted, people who otherwise could have afforded college are getting merit grants too, but that doesn't take away from the rest of us. I mean, who can't keep a B average?"

HEADLINE: Governors Island Transfer to New York Is Delayed 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
A few weeks ago it seemed a foregone conclusion that Gov. George E. Pataki would be standing on the more picturesque part of Governors Island sometime before Election Day as he signed papers that transferred control over the former military base from the federal government to New York State.
 But now, officials say, the long-awaited transfer of the island for a nominal (but so far undisclosed) sum has been delayed once again and may not take place for several weeks, or even months. 
 With Governor Pataki enjoying a comfortable lead in his bid for a third term, state and city officials no longer feel the pressure to complete the deal for the island before the election on Nov. 5, and are instead pressing the federal government to give $20 million to $30 million to accompany the transfer, according to an official involved in the negotiations. 
The talks began after President Bush announced in April that the island, which is in New York Harbor about a half-mile from Lower Manhattan, would be turned over to New York rather than sold to a private developer. 
"The governor is looking in good enough shape" for re-election, the official said yesterday, speaking only on condition of anonymity. "There's no need to roll out anything half-baked just for cosmetic reasons." The negotiations were halted about a month ago, the official said.
Some state and city economic development officials have maintained for months that New York cannot afford to assume the burden of paying for the upkeep of the island, 172 acres above water and 32 acres submerged, at least during the current budget crisis. They say the federal government should give some money for a transition, as it did for some military bases that were closed in the 1990's.
Another official who has taken part in the Governors Island discussions said the prospects for federal aid had improved in recent weeks.
The General Services Administration, the federal agency that has been responsible for Governors Island, has been paying $6 million to $10 million a year to prevent deterioration in the sea wall and the island's 225 buildings, many from the early 1800's, said John N. Marcic, a deputy director of the agency's realty services division.
Whatever deal is struck, the National Parks Service will operate a park at Fort Jay and Castle Williams, each of which had a significant role in the War of 1812. An area of about 20 acres encompassing the forts was designated a national monument in 2001 and is expected to be returned immediately to the federal government.
Though the federal government was originally eager to get the rest of Governors Island off its books by Oct. 1, the end of the fiscal year, pressure to complete the transfer has been eased because of the stalemate over the federal budget.
Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, a Democrat whose district includes Governors Island, said it was not unreasonable for New York to demand a subsidy. He pointed out that New York State once owned the island and gave it to the Army in 1800. (The Army turned it over to the Coast Guard in 1966.)
Complicating the transfer of the island has been the question of what can be done with it once it is back in New York's hands. Under the terms of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, the island has to be sold to the state at fair-market value.
Since the price tag will be minimal, officials say that some development will be allowed -- a hotel, a conference center, a restaurant and souvenir shops, for example -- but that large-scale commercial development will be barred. About 40 acres of the island will be set aside for a park and 20 acres more will be used for educational purposes, under the leadership of the City University of New York, officials said.
At a recent panel discussion at the Museum of the American Indian, Joseph B. Rose, a member of the City Planning Commission, said that much of the discussion about Governors Island bordered on fantasy. Mr. Rose, who was the agency's chairman under former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said that the island was not very enticing to developers because it was accessible only by boat and was cold and windy for six months of the year. "Governors Island is as much a liability as it is an asset," Mr. Rose said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
If taxes were lower,the economy would grow faster, right? Economists say not necessarily.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick's new book, "Why Economies Grow," has just been published by Basic Books. He the editor of Challenge Magazine and the journal Indicators, and also teaches at Cooper Union. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
AS Election Day approaches, serious discussion about economic policies is hamstrung by the devotion of both parties to reducing taxes. The big reason, of course, is that President Bush emphasizes tax cuts, including elimination of the estate tax, to the exclusion of almost everything else. The Democrats, in turn, hesitate to propose an economic plan that does not include long-term reductions for middle-income workers, and most refuse to talk about rescinding the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy.
 But the degree of misleading information emanating from both Washington and the media about how taxes affect the economy is disturbing. As I listen to the radio, watch TV news and read a variety of newspapers, it seems that quite a few Americans, including economics writers and media hosts, think that low-tax countries unquestionably grow faster than high-tax economies. Right and left, they seem to attribute more rapid growth in America to lower taxes. 
 What may surprise them is that there is no evidence for that. "You can make a theoretical case that high taxes impede economic growth, but it is just not supported by the evidence in the U.S. or across countries," said William Easterly, a former World Bank economist soon to join the faculty of New York University.
One of the most interesting research papers on the subject was done a few years ago by two economists from institutions that are hardly hotbeds of liberal protax views, the University of Chicago and the University of Rochester. Nancy L. Stokey of Chicago and Sergio Rebelo, then at Rochester but now at Northwestern, noted that income tax revenue in the United States rose to 15 percent of gross domestic product in 1942, from about 2 percent in 1913, when the tax was introduced -- providing a useful natural experiment about the economic effects of taxes.
But, they concluded, "This large rise in income tax rates produced no noticeable effect on the average growth rate of the economy."
Comparing other nations' experiences adds considerable weight to the argument that the level of taxes has had little long-term effect on growth. Joel Slemrod of the University of Michigan has written with Jon Bakija an excellent book on the subject, "Taxing Ourselves" (MIT Press). The authors compared the G.D.P. per capita with the level of taxes in the two dozen member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Relatively low-tax nations like the United States and Japan did well, they found, but so did high-tax nations in Scandinavia and elsewhere. More important, the authors contradict earlier findings that purported to show that high taxes reduced growth rates. There is no such relationship, they found; many economists now agree.
"The earlier studies were not very robust," said Mr. Easterly, who with others reviewed much of Mr. Slemrod's work. 
In the short run, tax cuts, like President John F. Kennedy's in the 1960's, can be stimulative. But why has tax policy had no clear influence over growth in the long run? It would seem that if taxes were lowered, people would work harder. But Mr. Slemrod and others have found little evidence that workers put in more hours when tax rates fall or fewer when they rise.
Others assert that high marginal tax rates erode the entrepreneurial spirit. After President Bill Clinton early in his first term engineered an increase in the highest bracket to 39.6 percent from 31 percent, economists like Martin Feldstein of Harvard argued that the wealthy would now earn less because they had less incentive to work and invest.
Incomes of this group did go down in 1993, but only because so many shifted income to 1992 to avoid the tax increase. But by 1994, the income of the wealthy was rising rapidly, despite the higher marginal rates.
American economic history since World War II also provides a natural experiment about taxation. The rate of economic growth slowed markedly in the early 1970's from its rapid pace the previous 25 years. But taxes did not rise in this period. To the contrary, the federal government has been collecting about the same proportion of G.D.P. in taxes for 50 years.
On the other hand, the composition of taxes changed. Marginal rates fell for the rich much more than they did for the middle and poor over this period. In the early 1980's, tax cuts by President Ronald Reagan plus increases in payroll taxes made the American system considerably less progressive than it was in the 1950's and 1960's.
If lower taxes for the rich do indeed raise incentives to entrepreneurialism, the United States should have grown faster, not more slowly.
Arguing along those same discredited lines, some economic analysts assert that the capital gains tax cut of 1997 produced the economic boom of the late 1990's. But not one serious study, Mr. Slemrod said, suggests that it did. 
These questions remain open to new research. At least one new study suggests that lower marginal rates may encourage people to work harder, but the preponderance of evidence still argues against it. Other economists have done studies to show that segments of the economy may be stimulated by tax cuts, like small business, but other economists counter that this does not mean the economy over all will benefit. You more or less take from Peter to pay Paul.
Then why do many high-tax countries do so well? "Looking at taxes only is only one-half of the story," Mr. Slemrod said. "If government raised taxes but then spent the money poorly, the economy would grow more slowly."
Could it be that some governments spend tax revenue more effectively than others and may even promote growth in the process? Now there's a good question for Americans to ponder as they go to the polls next week.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg, Needing Albany's Fiscal Help, Is Asking Nicely 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has had a fairly consistent Albany strategy all year: do not ask for too much state money, do not whine or bully, and praise state officials, especially Gov. George E. Pataki, at every possible juncture in this election year.
 But if the mayor is hoping to parlay this friendly approach into lots of money to ease the city's budget troubles after the election, he may have to think again. The state faces its own deficit. And some fiscal analysts are now questioning whether the mayor's Mr. Nice Guy approach was a good idea, or whether he should have sought more money from Albany in this election year, the traditional time to hand out goodies. 
 "I think it was a major mistake by the mayor, and a real missed opportunity for the city," said Jonathan Bowles, the research director for the Center for an Urban Future, a nonpartisan research group. "I think he put politics before the budget needs of the city, and he thought it would pay off. Who knows? The governor could still deliver something to the city, if he is re-elected, but the opportunity may well have slipped by, given that the state is in much worse shape now than it was a year ago." 
Others hold that the mayor's approach, quietly building friendly relationships with the main players, is likely to yield dividends later.
"I'm loath to criticize his negotiating skills," said William B. Eimicke, a professor of public administration at Columbia University, who noted the mayor's success in winning control of the school system from Albany after lots of quiet behind-the-scenes maneuvering. "There are always two layers to this, the visible and the invisible. And he seems to be very good at the invisible."
Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged yesterday that he might not be able to expect much from the state next year, when the city faces a deficit of $5 billion to $6 billion. 
"I think that we have to be realistic that they're going to have a budget problem of their own," he said. "One of the big differences between the 1970's and today is in the 70's, New York City got itself in trouble but the state was in good health and the surrounding communities were in good health. Now the state is not in such good health, most states are not in such good health and other municipalities are also having problems, so the amount of help you can get may in fact turn out to be somewhat less."
Already the governor has shot down one idea suggested by the mayor, increased bridge tolls, and another that the mayor was considering: reinstating the commuter tax. Instead he has spoken somewhat vaguely about working to secure help for the city from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and from the federal government.
Still, the mayor called himself optimistic, and heaped more praise yesterday on Governor Pataki, as well as the legislative leaders, Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, whom he took golfing in Bermuda this week. He thanked them for coming through with more than $400 million this year.
But most of that money was not ready cash. In many cases the state simply let the city raise money on its own, by increasing parking fines and telephone taxes and by raising its cigarette tax by $1.42 a pack. And the state is keeping nearly half the $250 million that the city had hoped to raise from the new cigarette tax. The mayor, characteristically, did not raise a ruckus about that.
The largest chunk of state aid -- about $200 million, which is being used to pay for raises for teachers this year -- is money that the city has claimed the state owed it for years, for old education expenses. City officials said they were happy to get it; still, it was a one-time revenue, and next year the cost of the higher salaries will remain.
William T. Cunningham, the mayor's communications director, said that Mr. Bloomberg's approach had been to level with state officials about what the city needed, and to be mindful of their own budget constraints. "When a governor has a good relationship with a mayor, the city benefits," Mr. Cunningham said. "And to complete the circle, when the city benefits, the entire state benefits."

HEADLINE: Passage of Antismoking Law May Be Linked to Wage Bill 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
The City Council and the Bloomberg administration remained at an impasse yesterday over the mayor's antismoking legislation, as Council officials hastily scheduled a second hearing on the measure for tomorrow.
 From the beginning, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has made it clear that extending the city's antismoking law to small restaurants, bars and bar areas was a personal policy goal, but it has faced opposition in the Council from members worried about the economic impact on establishments in their neighborhoods. 
 Speaker Gifford Miller has remained noncommittal on the smoking bill, and officials signaled that he would not support it unless the mayor backed Mr. Miller's own pet measure: a bill to guarantee certain workers a so-called living wage, which the administration has opposed. 
Officials have insisted that the two measures were being considered separately and on the merits alone, but Mr. Miller had suggested to Mr. Bloomberg that if he could provide a version of the living wage bill that he could live with, the Council would try to accommodate him in the same fashion on the smoking legislation, according to someone who was involved in the negotiations.
Council officials had hoped to reach such an agreement on the living wage bill before yesterday's committee vote. In exchange, they would schedule a speedy hearing on the smoking bill, at which they could present a compromise acceptable to the Bloomberg administration. It appeared yesterday that none of those goals had been met.
After a day of frantic negotiations, a Council committee passed a version of the living wage bill that Mr. Bloomberg had not yet decided whether to sign, said Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the mayor. And although the Council had scheduled a hearing for tomorrow on the smoking bill, officials said they could always cancel it.
The living wage bill approved by the committee is scaled back from its original draft and would set minimum wages that some city contractors pay to home health aides, day care workers and workers with agencies dealing with cerebral palsy. But the Council agreed to delete provisions that required a higher wage for employees at companies that received city subsidies to operate or renovate office buildings, including several investment banks.
The Council also deleted provisions setting a minimum wage for employees of business improvement districts and office buildings in which city agencies rent several floors.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
The new leader of I.B.M. explains his strategic course.

BYLINE:  By Steve Lohr 

 BODY:
WITH a speech in New York yesterday at the start of a costly and quirky marketing campaign, Samuel J. Palmisano, I.B.M.'s chief executive, declared his company was making a $10-billion bet on a strategic shift toward what it calls "on-demand computing."
 Mr. Palmisano told the business executives and industry analysts in attendance that on-demand computing would allow corporate customers to purchase computing resources as needed as a utility-style service, almost like electricity. Beyond cost savings, Mr. Palmisano explained that the utility model would help companies become more flexible and fast-moving by integrating more closely internal operations like procurement, marketing and manufacturing. The company also expects it to improve communications with partners, suppliers and customers. 
 The new marketing push from the WPP Group's Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide will account for most of I.B.M.'s $500 million-a-year advertising budget and is the sequel to I.B.M.'s "e-business" campaign. That effort, though initially derided by rivals when it began in 1997, proved quite successful, by explaining the practical uses of the Internet to I.B.M.'s mainstream corporate customers.
But the new I.B.M. initiative -- called "e-business on demand" -- faces a tougher challenge. Unlike the late 1990's, today the economy is weak and corporate technology spending has collapsed. The grand promises of technology's benefits, made with such confidence a few years ago, remain unfulfilled. 
Yet Mr. Palmisano observed that he had seen "some encouraging signs" that the worst of the technology slump may be over and that corporate customers have not given up their faith in the productivity benefits of technology. His mildly encouraging comments helped prop up the stock market yesterday, and shares of I.B.M. rose $1.93 a share, to close at $78.67.
I.B.M's new campaign begins today with television advertisements and eight-page ad inserts in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The San Jose Mercury News. The ads poke fun at fantastic gadgets -- a time machine, a "universal business adapter" and "magic business beans," for example.
Chris Wall, head of the creative team at Ogilvy that developed the I.B.M. campaign, said the use of the zany machines was meant to be a humorous slap at the hype of the Internet bubble days. By contrast, I.B.M., the ads say, has the technology, people and skills to solve the real-world problems of company's grappling with the challenges in a turbulent economy. 
"Humor translates as confidence," Mr. Wall noted, "and that works well with I.B.M. these days."
The campaign also has broader objectives. It gives I.B.M.'s work force, and perhaps others in the industry, a goal to pursue and champion at a time when the industry is in the doldrums. Mr. Palmisano announced yesterday that Irving Wladawsky-Berger, an I.B.M. executive and scientist who led the company's drive to embrace the Internet, will lead the on-demand computing initiative. 
I.B.M.'s competitors -- Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, Microsoft -- are all working on utility computing, and some claim to be ahead in some areas. Yet the campaign is also meant to present I.B.M., which has by far the largest research budget in the industry, as the company with the most ambitious, far-reaching vision of an emerging direction in computing.
The glue for the on-demand model will be clever hardware and software, which I.B.M. hopes to supply. And helping corporate customers figure out how to move to the lower cost, more flexible world of business could generate a lot of new business for I.B.M.'s big services arm.
"What I.B.M. is doing is putting a big budget behind its effort and a label on it that will appeal to a business audience," said Frank Gillett, an analyst for Forrester Research.
The campaign also gives Mr. Palmisano, 51, who became chief executive in March and chairman on Tuesday, a highly visible strategic plan to claim as his own. His predecessor, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., who guided I.B.M. back from deep troubles in the early 1990's, is regarded as a brilliant business strategist. 
Industry analysts view Mr. Palmisano, a 29-year I.B.M. veteran, as an outstanding salesman and operations executive, though they were waiting to see what strategic course he would set.
In his speech yesterday, Mr. Palmisano placed many of the moves that had been made recently -- opening an advanced semiconductor plant, the acquisition of a string of software companies, the $3.5 billion purchase of PwC Consulting, and the new marketing campaign -- as all part of the on-demand computing strategy. All those investments added up to the $10-billion figure he used.
"It's a bold bet, no doubt about it," he said. "But I don't think it is a risky bet. It's what our customers want."

HEADLINE: Senate Candidates Exchange Fire In New Jersey Cable TV Debate 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J. Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Douglas R. Forrester, New Jersey's Republican nominee for the United States Senate, tonight finally got the debate he had so desperately sought. He used the televised forum to paint his Democratic opponent, Frank R. Lautenberg, as a relic of the past whose three terms in office had contributed to higher taxes, a depleted military and weakened intelligence-gathering capabilities.
 Mr. Lautenberg, who has run up a lead in the polls since he replaced Senator Robert G. Torricelli on the ballot and who has at times expressed indifference about debating, was only too happy to return fire. He accused Mr. Forrester of hiding his tax returns, overcharging infirm and elderly New Jerseyans for prescription drugs and concealing his conservative views against gun control, abortion rights and laws that would make polluters pay for cleaning up toxic waste. 
 Mr. Forrester was the more aggressive, scripted and focused of the two men. Time and again, he reminded viewers that Mr. Lautenberg voted for the 1983 bill that instituted a tax on the Social Security benefits of some elderly recipients, opposed the 1991 gulf war resolution and voted against several military spending bills.
"We can't return to the failed policies of the past, of weaker defense and weaker intelligence-gathering," Mr. Forrester said, describing himself as a fresh voice equipped to face the challenges of the future.
Mr. Lautenberg often gave the kind of meandering answers that have earned him a reputation as a poor orator. But he was quick to defend his record on Social Security and taxes, and made repeated references to the legislation he had written to protect New Jersey's environment and strengthen gun control. During his closing statement, Mr. Lautenberg, a World War II veteran, also scoffed at the notion that Mr. Forrester now portrayed himself as the candidate who was stronger on the issue of defense.
"Mr. Forrester makes these bold claims about how tough he would be," Mr. Lautenberg said. "When he had a chance to serve and put on his country's uniform, he chose not to do it. "
Their feisty -- if slightly disjointed -- encounter came after weeks of public jousting about how, and whether, they would debate. Mr. Forrester, who lacks Mr. Lautenberg's name recognition, originally asked to squeeze 21 debates into the final month of the campaign. Mr. Lautenberg delayed his approval of a schedule and ultimately won several concessions that limited the exposure Mr. Forrester received.
Tonight's program was broadcast by News 12 New Jersey, a cable station that reaches only about half of New Jersey's households.
The 30-minute face-to-face part of the debate took place only after Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. Forrester engaged in an hourlong free-for-all with the four minor-party candidates: Norman Wahner, Conservative Party; Elizabeth Macron, Libertarian; Ted Glick, Green Party; and Gregory Pason, Socialist Party.
Even with the four other candidates present however, Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. Forrester were not distracted from firing salvos directly at each other. During his opening statement, Mr. Forrester bragged that he had driven Mr. Torricelli from the race and portrayed Mr. Lautenberg as the hapless replacement selected by "party bosses." When it was Mr. Lautenberg's turn to make an opening statement, he quickly charged that Mr. Forrester had no choice but to focus on Mr. Torricelli's ethical problems because his own views on social issues are too conservative for a state as moderate as New Jersey.
"His concerns are Bob Torricelli," Mr. Lautenberg said with a smile. "Bob Torricelli is already out of the race. Perhaps he didn't know that."
When asked about Social Security, the burdensome cost of prescription drugs and the state's economy, Mr. Forrester blamed Mr. Lautenberg -- and in each instance gave a response that somehow managed to mention the Social Security tax, which, he reminded viewers, costs the average New Jersey recipient $945 per year.
Mr. Lautenberg said he supported a Social Security tax because the system was going bankrupt, and he said that Mr. Forrester's solution would allow the system to fail. Mr. Lautenberg also warned voters that Mr. Forrester intended to use money from the trust fund to pay for the Bush administration's tax cut, which gives a disproportionately large benefit to the wealthiest one percent of Americans.
Before the program, some of Mr. Forrester's aides had suggested that Mr. Lautenberg, 78, was ducking debates because a televised appearance might raise questions about whether he was too old to effectively serve a six-year term. During the debate, Mr. Forrester said he raised the issue only because during Mr. Lautenberg's first race in 1982, he made similar charges against an opponent who was 72 at the time.
Some political analysts said that given Mr. Lautenberg's occasionally rambling responses, Republicans were likely to continue pressing the age issue.
"I think we saw today that Frank Lautenberg has been out of circulation for a while and his debating skills needed a bit of honing," said David Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University.
But Mr. Lautenberg said that he was gratified to have had the chance to present his views alongside Mr. Forrester's, and that he was confident he still had the stamina and determination to handle the rough and tumble of politics. As he walked past 150 demonstrators on his way into the studio, one reached out and punched him in the arm, but Mr. Lautenberg brushed it aside.
"I was ready to start swinging back," he said later with a smile.
